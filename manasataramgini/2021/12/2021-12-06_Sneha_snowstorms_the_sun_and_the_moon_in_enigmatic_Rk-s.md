Sneha, snowstorms, the sun and the moon in enigmatic ṛk-s

That the Indo-European homeland was a cold place with snow is evidenced
by widespread survival of two hon-homologous words for snow. Recently, a
discussion on one of these words, sparked by some linguist, landed on my
timeline on Twitter. From that, it seemed that people were unaware of
the attestation of its cognate in Old Indo-Aryan. This, in turn,
reminded me of a discussion we had with our friend in college on the
very same issue. Hence, we thought it worthwhile to put down this
discussion — this apposite since the winter solstice is approaching, and
as we write this note, it is a new moon with a solar eclipse in
Antarctica.

The two words for snow that can be traced back to early Indo-European,
probably even PIE, are attested in Sanskrit as sneha and himá/hímā. The
udātta is represented by the acute sign and differs between the
masculine form that is usually used for snow and the feminine for
winter.

Sneha is represented by many cognates that include snow itself; Old
Iranian has snaēža = to snow; Baltic: (Lithuanian) sniẽgas; Germanic:
(Old English): snīwan. There are the 0-graded forms in: Greek: niphás =
snowflake; Latin: nivis; Celtic (Welsh): nyf. Thus, it is a solid IE
word. Interestingly, it has also been transferred to Sumerian in a form
that suggests either early Indo-European or the Satem clade
(Balto-Slavo-Aryan) as the possible sources. This might point to a
potential trade contact between Sumerians and the Indo-Europeans in
their colder lands to the north of the former. Coming to Indo-Aryan,
while etymologists recognize the ancestral form as being Sanskrit sneha,
they usually only cite Prakritic siṇeha or siṇhā as cognates bypassing
Sanskrit as though it is not attested in it. However, as we shall see
below, this is not true. In New Indo-Aryan languages that are still
familiar with snow we have descendants of the Prakritic forms as the
primary word for snow, e.g., Kashmiri shīna (pronounced these days with
terminal schwa loss).

The second word hima, was probably paralogously polysemous right from
the early stages of PIE, meaning both winter and snow. It is clearly
inherited from PIE in the Indo-Hittite sense as we have Hittite gimmanza
= winter. We have Baltic (Lithuanian): žiemà = winter; Greek: kheima =
snowstorm/cold; khion = snow; Armenian: jiun = snow; Latin: hiems=
winter; Celtic (Old Welsh) gaem = winter. In Sanskrit we see all the
senses being attested. The usage śata-himā is literally a 100 winters,
meaning hundred years. A similar usage is seen in Latin, e.g., bīmus
from \*bihimos — lasting two years. The form hemanta again denotes a
season marking the end of winter. On the other hand, the form himavant
means a mountain \[covered\] with snow. Similarly, in the Ṛgveda hima
can be directly used to indicate snow, for example:

himenāgniṃ ghraṃsam avārayethām  
pitumatīm ūrjam asmā adhattam ।  
ṛbīse atrim aśvināvanītam  
un ninyathuḥ sarvagaṇaṃ svasti ॥ RV 1.116.8

With snow, you two averted the scorching fire,  
you two bestowed nourishing food for him \[Atri\],  
You two Aśvin-s, led out Atri from the fuming crater,  
into which he been led, and all the troop to weal.

This ṛk attributed to Kakṣivant Dairghatamasa \[Footnote 2\] is an
allusion to the famous deed of the Aśvin-s that is repeatedly alluded to
in the RV, where they saved Atri from a fuming crater. The simple
reading of the verse would imply that Atri was led into it along with
his troops. They were cooled with snow and then brought up. The phrase
sarvagaṇaṃ svasti occurs only one other time in the RV, in a sūkta of
the Atri-s; however, there it refers to the gaṇa-s of the god Bṛhaspati.
Nevertheless, one wonders if there is a subtler, undiscovered connection
furnished by this cognate phrase from these relatively late sūkta-s of
the RV. Finally, one may comment that this tale hints at the possibility
of Atri and his men having fallen into one of the geothermal craters in
the Caspian-Black Sea region close to the IE homeland.

Returning to sneha-, we tabulate below the occurrence of this word in
some old Vedic texts relative to hima- (while we count both senses of
hima- we do not count the season hemanta in the below table).

|                          |       |      |
|--------------------------|-------|------|
| Text                     | sneha | hima |
| Ṛgveda                   | 2     | 11   |
| Atharvaveda (vulgate)    | 1     | 16   |
| Atharvaveda (Paippalāda) | 0     | 35   |
| Taittirīya Saṃhitā       | 0     | 10   |

Thus, it is clear that sneha, while attested in the oldest surviving
Indo-Aryan text (the single AV-vulgate instance is identical to the ṛk
found in the RV), it is absent in the successor texts though hima-
remains as common or is more frequently used. However, we should also
add that a related form snīhiti (snowstorm) occurs once in the RV and
once in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. In the case of sneha, a semantic shift
occurred in Sanskrit, where it came to denote a wide range of things,
including fluidity, smoothness, oil/fat and love. We will next examine
the two occurrences in the RV and suggest that they are semantically
aligned with the Middle and New Indo-Aryan forms. Both occur in
enigmatic sūkta-s/ṛk-s that need further discussion.

The first occurrence is in a long sūkta of Tiraścī Āṅgirasa on the many
glorious acts of Indra, which needs to be described to give some
context. The first three ṛk-s (1-3) describe the might of Indra and his
vajra and also allude to his act of piercing the ![3 \\times
7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
mountains with his arrow. This motif is reused by Vālmīki in the
Rāmāyaṇa when Rāma pierces the seven trees to prove his might
(Indra-hood displacing that of the mighty Vālin) to the ape Sugrīva. The
following triad (4-6) describes how Indra, in his cosmogonic form as the
generator of all beings, slew Ahi with his vajra, even as the mountains
shrieked. The Marut-s seeing his valor, approached him for an alliance,
like brāhmaṇa-s reciting mantra-s to praise him. The next tṛca (7-9)
describes a Marut-centric version of the Vṛtra myth. When Vṛtra
violently sallied forth, the other gods, who were the companions of
Indra, retreated, leaving him alone in the battle. However, the 360
Marut-s (an unusual count associated with the days in an year) singing
the praises of Indra joined him in battle, asking for a share of the
ritual offerings. They urged Indra to scatter the anti-deva asura-s with
his vajra and cakra, assisted by their battle formation fronted by their
sharp spears.

In the next tṛca (10-12), the Āṅgirasa calls on his fellow ritualists to
send forth their chants to Indra. In the tṛca (13-15), which includes
the ṛk of specific interest to us, the narration moves to the battles
fought by Indra against the enemies of the gods in alliance with
Bṛhaspati. This triad is soaked in astronomical allegory, with the god
Bṛhaspati himself likely being represented in the sky by the planet
Jupiter. The main feature of this triad is the mention of a black
(shrouding like a cloud) drop, kṛṣṇa drapsa, which is said to wander to
the solstitial colure along a sinuous river Aṃsumati. We interpret this
river as the lunar ecliptic. The whole myth seems to encode a solar
eclipse close to the winter solstice (The old Aryan New Year), in which
context the snowstorm is mentioned. The next tṛca (16-18) describes the
following acts of Indra: 1. Right when he was born, he became the foe of
the seven unrivaled ones (not entirely clear who they are). 2. He
discovered Dyaus and Pṛthivi, which were hidden. 3. He set into motion
the wide-ranging worlds. 4. He smashed the unrivaled one (Vṛtra) with
his vajra. 5. He slew Śuśna. 5. He discovered the hidden cows. 6. He
demolished the fortifications. 7. He released the frozen rivers and slew
the demoness (an allusion to Dānu) lording over the waters. The final
tṛca (19-21) praises Indra as Vṛtrahan and the lord of the Ṛbhu-s,
calling on him for the soma offering.

ava drapso aṃśumatīm atiṣṭhad  
iyānaḥ kṛṣṇo daśabhiḥ sahasraiḥ  
āvat tam indraḥ śacyā dhamantam  
apa snehitīr nṛmaṇā adhatta ॥ RV 8.96.13  
The drop stood at the Aṃśumatī,  
the black \[drop\] wanders with the ten thousand.  
Indra helped it \[the drop\] blowing along with his skill.  
The manly-minded \[Indra\] repulsed the snowstorm.

drapsam apaśyaṃ viṣuṇe carantam  
upahvare nadyo aṃśumatyāḥ ।  
nabho na kṛṣṇam avatasthivāṃsam  
iṣyāmi vo vṛṣaṇo yudhyatājau ॥ RV 8.96.14  
I saw the drop wandering at the solstice,  
in the sinuous path of the River Aṃśumatī,  
going down like a black cloud,  
I impel you, bulls, to fight in the battle.

adha drapso aṃśumatyā upasthe  
.adhārayat tanvaṃ titviṣāṇaḥ ।  
viśo adevīr abhy ācarantīr  
bṛhaspatinā yujendraḥ sasāhe ॥ RV 8.96.14  
Then, the drop, in the lap of the Aṃśumatī,  
bore the body sparkling with light.  
As the deva-less folks moved forth \[to attack\],  
united with Bṛhaspati, Indra conquered \[them\].

**Commentary:** The black drop (drapsa, an old IE word) is interpreted
as the new Moon. The drop is associated most commonly with soma (with a
lunar equivalence in several cases; on rare occasions it is used for
Venus). Normally, the soma is silvery — ṛjīśin (like earlier in this
sūkta) — reinforcing the lunar connection. However, here the drop is
explicitly and atypically described as black, suggesting that the new
Moon is alluded to. The first ṛk mentions the drop wandering with a ten
thousand: we take this large number to denote the stars. The drop is
seen as blowing along: we consider this an early allusion to the
primitive Hindu astronomical theory (shared with the Greeks and likely
of old IE provenance) of celestial bodies being blown on their paths by
cosmic winds. In the second ṛk, the composer states that he sees the
black drop which is likened to a cloud — suggesting its shrouding nature
— wandering near a colure. He also mentions the sinuous course of the
river Aṃśumatī. Given that the word aṃśu is used for soma (or the soma
stalks before extraction of the juice) and metaphorically connects the
soma plant and the Moon, Aṃśumatī would mean the riverine path with
soma/the Moon. Hence, we take this to be an allusion to the lunar
path/ecliptic \[Footnote 3\].

We take the colure (viṣuṇa) to be solstitial. Winter is the season that
corresponds to the battle between the gods, led by Indra, and the
demons. The verb, ava-sthā = going own, suggests the nether point of the
ecliptic path analogized to a river. Hence, we hold that the solstice
referred to is specifically the winter solstice. Thus, it is not any new
moon but likely the new Moon closest to the winter solstice,
corresponding to the old Aryan New Year. This, in turn, supports the
idea that the snehiti which Indra averts is indeed a snowstorm. The
final ṛk of this triad mentions the black drop in the lap of Aṃśumatī,
where it paradoxically takes on a body sparkling with light. We take
this to allude to a solar eclipse happening close to the solstice. The
at the point of emergence of the sun from the total eclipse or an
annular eclipse would indeed give the impression of the black drop (the
Moon) taking on a glittering body. Thus, this is a variant of the famous
Svarbhānu eclipse myth of the Atri-s but probably referring to a
specific eclipse near the solstice. In this context, the attack adevī
folks should be taken as a purposeful conflation of the earthly enemies
with the asura-s causing the eclipse as in the Svarbhānu myth. Moreover,
given the overall celestial setting, the specific involvement of
Bṛhaspati, as a companion of Indra, in this conflict suggests the
potential presence of Jupiter in the vicinity during this event (Or
perhaps in the nakṣatra of Tiṣyā).

We may also point out that the deployment of snow or other “weather
weapons” is a feature of the battles of Indra with the dānava-s
elsewhere in the RV. For example, Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa gives an account
of the battle between Indra and Ahi, when the latter had frozen the
rivers and corralled the cows. Here, Ahi, first tries to pierce Indra
with his spear, but Indra evades him by becoming the tail of a horse.
Having evaded his strike, Indra conquered the cows and the soma and
released the waters. Then he closed in for combat with Ahi:

nāsmai vidyun na tanyatuḥ siṣedha  
na yām miham akirad dhrāduniṃ ca ।  
indraś ca yad yuyudhāte ahiś ca  
utāparībhyo maghavā vi jigye ॥ RV 1.32.13  
Neither the lightning nor the thunder scared away \[Indra\] for him,  
neither the snow (/mist) nor the hail that he \[Ahi\] spread out.  
When Indra and Ahi fought each other,  
Maghavan triumphed, \[then\] and also for the time that came.

Here, Ahi deploys various “weather weapons”, reminiscent of the steppe
“rain-stone” magic of the Turkic and Mongolic world, but they fail to
scare away Indra. The first two, lightning and thunder are unambiguous,
and so is the final one, hail (hrāduni). The word miha could mean snow
or mist. In either case, it supports the deployment of such weather
weapons, consistent with the interpretation of sneha- as snow, i.e., in
a snowstorm.

Strikingly, the second occurrence of sneha- is again in the context of
the same eclipse myth. This account occurs in the monster sūkta of
maṇḍala 9, which agglomerates shorter sūkta-s of various Vasiṣṭha-s and
Kutsa Āṅgirasa. We shall consider the whole tṛca with this reference
below:

ayā pavā pavasvainā vasūni  
māṃścatva indo sarasi pra dhanva ।  
bradhnaś cid atra vāto na jūtaḥ  
purumedhaś cit takave naraṃ dāt ॥ RV 9.97.52  
Bring (addressed to soma), by purifying yourself with this filtering,
riches.  
At the hiding of the Moon, O drop (moon/soma), run forth into the
lake.  
The yellowish (sun) is also here as if impelled by the wind.  
the wise one (Soma) has indeed given us the man (Indra) for the sally.

uta na enā pavayā pavasva  
adhi śrute śravāyyasya tīrthe ।  
ṣaṣṭiṃ sahasrā naiguto vasūni  
vṛkṣaṃ na pakvaṃ dhūnavad raṇāya ॥ RV 9.97.52  
Also with this filtering purify yourself,  
at the front of the famous ford of celebration.  
Sixty thousand treasures the destroyer of rivals,  
like a tree with ripe fruits, will shake down for triumph.

mahīme asya vṛṣanāma śūṣe  
māṃścatve vā pṛśane vā vadhatre ।  
asvāpayan nigutaḥ snehayac ca  
apāmitrāṃ apācito acetaḥ ॥  
The bull is his name \[Indra\], great and fierce, are his two,  
deadly weapons, in the hiding of the Moon or in the touching.  
He put to sleep the rivals and snowed down on them.  
Repulse the enemies, repulse the senseless ones.

**Commentary:** Composite sūkta-s, like the one in which these ṛk-s of
Kutsa Āṅgirasa occur, are typical of the final part of maṇḍala 9. Except
for Kutsa, who is the author of the last 4 tṛca-s and the terminal ṛk
with the classic Kutsa refrain, all the other authors are Vāsiṣṭha-s.
However, throughout the long sūkta (longest in the RV) we find several
allusions to the finding of the sun’s path, the holding of the sun, and
soma as the Moon. Thus, it is not out of place to furnish an
astronomical explanation for these ṛk-s. Key to the interpretation of
these ṛk-s is a rare word māṃścatu/māṃścatva whose meaning has puzzled
students over the ages. It occurs only thrice in the RV, and its meaning
was already obscure to Yāska, who groups it with the words for horses in
the Nighaṇṭu. Two of the occurrences are in this tṛca, and one is in RV
7.44.3 by Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi. Thus, this word perhaps links the
Vāsiṣṭha-s to Kutsa. It can be etymologized as maṃs+catu. Catu can be
derived from the root cat- = to hide or vanish. Māṃs (with a pure
anunāsika) is taken to mean the Moon, an older variant of mās, closely
related to the form in early Indo-European. This form is supported by
other Indo-European cognates like: Baltic (Latvian): mēnesis; Latin:
mensis. Thus, the word is taken to mean the vanishing of the Moon. To
their credit, some white indologists have correctly etymologized this
word using comparisons across IE. However, they failed to understand its
actual meaning. Notably, on the only occasions it occurs in RV, it is
coupled with bradhna — the yellowish or reddish sun. This is also seen
in the case of the verse of Vasiṣṭha:

dadhikrāvāṇam bubudhāno agnim  
upa bruva uṣasaṃ sūryaṃ gām ।  
bradhnam māṃścator varuṇasya babhruṃ  
te viśvāsmad duritā yāvayantu ॥  
Ever having awakened, to Dadhikrāvan and Agni  
I speak; to Uṣas, and the sun, the cow.  
The yellowish one from the hiding of the Moon, \[becomes\] Varuṇa’s
brown one,  
let them drive away all the bad things from us.

Notably, the first ṛk of Kutsa, explicitly states that the sun (bradhna)
is also at at the same place as the hiding of the Moon. The sun is said
to be impelled to that place by the wind — again, note an allusion to
the old hypothesis of the cosmic winds moving the celestial bodies (c.f.
the above ṛk of Tiraścī Āṅgirasa). This conjunction corresponds to
amāvāsya or the sun and moon “dwelling together”, resulting in the new
Moon (or the hiding/vanishing of the Moon). Hence, māṃścatva should be
understood as the “hiding of the moon” at new Moon in all its
occurrences. However, there are indications that it is a new moon with a
solar eclipse. The final ṛk talks of two events, the māṃścatva and the
pṛśana, i.e., the touching. We take this touching as the “contact” of
the sun and Moon implying an eclipse. Moreover, the ṛk of Vasiṣṭha,
states that the bradhna (usually yellow or red) is Varuṇa’s brown one
from the māṃścatu. This suggests that the sun’s darkening, indicating a
solar eclipse at the new moon \[Footnote 1\].

We also encounter the cryptic statements parallel to the ṛk-s of Tiraścī
Āṅgirasa, such as the drop (Moon) running into the lake. This is also
called the famous ford (tīrtha) — you can cross over to the “other side”
there. We take these as allusions to the winter solstitial point on the
ecliptic. Thus, we believe both Kutsa and Tiraścī are talking about the
same or a similar eclipse close to the winter solstice. However,
notably, in this case, it is Indra who showers snow on the enemies,
putting them to “sleep” — again reminding us of the use of rain/snow
stones in the Altaic warfare. Thus, the two occurrences of sneha+ and
the one occurrence of snīh- in the RV indicate the use of this ancient
IE word in the sense of snow. The interesting early polymorphism in the
form of sneh- and snīh- suggests that the ancestral state of this word,
perhaps even its form in the original dialect in which the RV was
composed, was close to the ancestral Baltic version (at least the first
syllable). Thus, we are probably seeing a fossil of the dialect
diversity in early Indo-Aryan or Indo-Iranian itself.

To conclude, we may note, an eclipse at the solstice is a relatively
rare event. However, if we give a leeway of about 5 days on either side
of the winter solstice, one may get more of such events. Below is a list
of such events that have happened or will happen over 3 centuries from
1801-2100 CE anywhere in the world grouped by their ![\\approx

year lunar cycle from the catalog of Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak
(provided by NASA):  
21 Dec 1805; 20 Dec 1824; 21 Dec 1843; 21 Dec 1862  
22 Dec 1870; 22 Dec 1889; 23 Dec 1908  
24 Dec 1916; 24 Dec 1927  
25 Dec 1935; 25 Dec 1954; 24 Dec 1973; 24 Dec 1992  
25 Dec 2000; 26 Dec 2019; 26 Dec 2038; 26 Dec 2057  
27 Dec 2065; 27 Dec 2084  
17 Dec 2066

One can see that between 1900-2100 there have been/there are no events
on the solstice day. However, in 1870 CE we had a very close pass within
12 hours of the solstice. In general, the 1800s saw several close
events, but the following two centuries did not. Due to the 19-year
clusters, we cannot be sure that the ones recorded in the RV were the
same event. However, their relative rarity and clustering would mean
that they might have been dramatic enough to leave a memory in the text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Footnote 1: This occurs in the context of Dadhikrāvan, who is typically
invoked in the dawn ritual. We posit that Dadhikrāvan represents a
heliacally rising old Vedic constellation, although its identity still
remains uncertain.

Foonote 2: While its style is similar to that of the old Gotama founders
like Kakṣivant and his father, the sūkta itself mentions Kakṣivant in
the third person and talks of the later Gotama-s. This suggests that it
was appended later to the Kakṣivant collection by one of his successors.

Foonote 3: In later Hindu tradition, the lunar and solar paths are often
depicted on temple roofs as sinuous snakes.

This is the second of the two stories that arose from incidents during
the visit of Yaśaśravas, Somakhya’s cousin. With the autumnal vacations,
Somakhya was having a good time with his visiting cousin, giving him
lectures on the theory and the practice of the study of variable stars.
During the day, they spent their time with numerical solutions of
differential equations that modeled the pulsations of stars. At night,
they observed the stars in good view from Somakhya’s terrace with the
smog of the fireworks having lifted. Additionally, as instructed by
Somakhya’s father, he was also teaching Yashashravas sections of the
hautra mantra-pāṭha. The on the second day of his cousin’s visit, the
two of them were doing their evening saṃdhyā rituals together when
Somakhya was disturbed by a peculiar behavior evinced by his cousin. In
the midst of his prāṇāyāma or arghya, Yashashravas suddenly uttered the
word Āpastamba-sūtra almost randomly a few times with a peculiar
affectation and cadence. Somakhya was taken aback, but remembering his
father’s words of never getting disturbed in his performance, he ignored
it and continued to the end. Somakhya: “Yashashravas, what is wrong with
you — have you gone crazy? Why were you randomly saying
“Āpastamba-sūtra” in the course of your saṃdhyāvandana? I know you are
of that school, but it makes no sense to pepper your upāsana with
utterances of that word, moreover voiced in that strange manner.”
Yashashravas felt as if some weight had lifted off his head and told
Somakhya a strange tale. Somakhya was shocked by it, but once he had
gathered himself, he said they should wait until his friend Lootika
visited before taking any further action.

Somakhya’s mother had wished to invite Lootika’s mother and her
daughters for the coming festival of Dattātreya that Somakhya’s family
observed; she thought it might also be an opportunity for some
socializing, given the visiting relatives. Somakhya was keen that his
friend be around to deal with the case of his cousin Yashashravas and
hear it from his own mouth. Yashashravas had already heard from their
other cousin [Babhru of his dramatic encounter with the four
sisters](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/09/18/the-social-phantasmagorical-and-historical-journey/);
hence, he anticipated it with some excitement. However, Somakhya was a
bit concerned that Yashashravas might clam up, feeling put off, if
Lootika’s sisters were also around — they were only a little less
formidable than his friend in terms of the impression they could produce
on introduction, as Babhru had experienced first hand. Shortly after
they arrived, Yashashravas quickly felt the edge of the sisters when
Varoli, who was younger than him, gave them a little talk about
Propynylidyne, Helium hydride, and Argon hydride their formation and
energetics in interstellar space. However, as Somakhya had hoped, their
mothers drew away the three younger sisters to look at jewelry, clothing
and watch some video recording with them in another room. This gave
Somakhya, Yashashravas and Lootika the solitude and time they wanted.

S: “Yashashravas, Lootika is our confidante and will be of great help in
trying to get to the bottom of your predicament. You can reliably share
all you need to with us. Let us lose no time and get started. For
Lootika’s benefit, could you tell your story right from the beginning
going back to your upanayana?”  
Y: As you know, Somakhya, for a variety of reasons, my upanayana was
performed about 6 years past the earliest recommended age at
Kshayadrajanagara. It was a big affair, and a pity you could not be
there due to the exams you had to give. However, our cousins and
relatives like Babhru, Saumanasa, Mandara, Charuchitra and Varaha, as
also our friend Indrasena and his brother, were all in attendance, and
we had great fun. I recall one major untoward incident. The giant
coconut tree in our grandfather’s house fell crashing the night after
the upanayana and destroyed the maṇḍapa. Hence, we could not perform the
Skanda-pūjā the next day, which is customary in our families. For three
days after the upanayana, a snātaka from Kāśi, who, like me was an
adherent of the Āpastamba school, was sent by the purohita who had
performed your Atharvan upanayana. He taught me the correct performance
of the saṃdhyopāsana along with some scholiastic material of Khaṇdadeva
for several hours. On the afternoon of fourth day after the upanayana,
Indrasena and I were seated on the parapet of our grandfather’s house
yarning away about something when we saw the said snātaka come. I was a
bit surprised because he was supposed to come only for 3 days, and it
was not yet the time for the saṃdhyā. I thought he had come by error and
wanted to tell him so. So, I jumped down from the parapet and ran out of
the gate towards him. He just ignored me and kept walking ahead, all the
while repeatedly saying “Āpastamba-sūtra” in the same manner you heard
me, most unfortunately, utter it during the saṃdhyā.

To my surprise, he just vanished at the end of the road on which our
grandfather’s house stands. It turned to shock when Indrasena said that
he suddenly disappeared from his sight too when I reached him. It got
worse when Indrasena’s brother, Pinakasena, who was beside the gate
making a tail for a kite, said that he thought we were playing some
stupid prank when he saw me speaking to the air — i.e., he did not see
the snātaka at all. It was all strange and funny for them, but for me,
it was just the beginning of a horror story! That evening as we sat for
saṃdhyā, I began jabbering “Āpastamba-sūtra” randomly in the course of
the ritual. Indrasena admonished me to be serious with the ritual and
did not believe it when I said that it was just involuntarily coming to
me without any effort on my part. To my horror, the same thing happened
when I was doing it with my father, and he blasted me for being
frivolous with the ritual. I felt too embarrassed to tell him what was
happening as I feared he might think I have gone mad. With great
self-effort, I acquired the ability to control it to a degree and
skipped sāyam-saṃdhyā if I could, for it came upon me only in the
evenings. I also got some relief, albeit incomplete, when, after
vedārambha, I started studying the rakṣohā mantra-s to Viṣṇu from the
Taittirīya-śruti. It returned with a frenzy on the upākarmā day and
completely ruined it. I told this to Babhru, who, as you know, is quite
frivolous, and he responded it was a good reason to stop saṃdhyā
altogether. But thereafter, he told me the unbelievable tale of when you
had visited him with Lootika and her sisters and added: “maybe you
should ask them to come over to your place too”. That is why I felt some
relief when you mentioned that this is something you would like to
handle with Lootika around.”

S: “So, Lootika, what do you think of this?”  
L: “Most remarkable and ghastly. It should be quite a problem for a V1
male not to be able to perform his saṃdhyā properly. But I’m puzzled by
this utterance of “Āpastamba-sūtra”. Is that something peculiar to the
Āpastamba school? As you know, my family follows the Bodhāyana-sūtra,
though, as far as I know, the Āpastamba-s are not very divergent, except
that they have lost the proper recitation of the Śrīsūkta and the
Skandayāga in its entirety.”  
Somakhya smiled saying:“I know you Bodhāyana-s are pretty proud of your
Śrīsūkta and Skandayāga”, even as Yashashravas intently turned his gaze
from one to the other. Suddenly, Lootika excitedly remarked: “Ah!
Somakhya, I remember you telling me of this particularly malevolent
sprite known as the Āpastamba-graha. My gut tells me that your cousin
has been seized by that.”  
S: “Yes, Gautamī! This is indeed the first time I am encountering that
sprite in person. Never thought we would do so in this life.”  
L: “I remember you telling me that he can be particularly nasty if we
try to bind him directly. So, how do we proceed against him?”  
S: “We should first hear him out. We will get some clue about how to
proceed from that.”  
L: “Sounds exciting. Can we get him to speak with a Ḍāmara-mantra?”  
S: “We can do so, but we have to take extra precautions and prepare
Yashashravas for it. I also suggest that you recall the short
Vīrabhadrāstra and keep it ready in your mind.”  
Somakhya went to the sacristy and brought out a special svayaṃbhu-liṅga
that he and Lootika had installed, some flowers, incense, a copper
plate, and a long abhicārika nail. He asked Yashashravas to perform a
Śivārchana of the liṇga with the following incantations:  
oṃ rudrāya namaḥ । oṃ uḍḍīśāya namaḥ । oṃ sudurlabhāya namaḥ । oṃ
kapardine namaḥ । oṃ virūpākṣāya namaḥ । oṃ sarva-graha-bhayāpahāya
namaḥ ॥  
Somakhya: “Lootika, why don’t you go out to the veranda and ready
yourself to deploy the Ḍāmara-prayoga; I’ll prep Yashashravas for it in
the meantime. Yashashravas, we diagnose you as being seized by a sprite
known as the Āpastambagraha. The sprite had its origin in the distant
past in the Marahaṭṭa country and has been spreading like a slow virus
by capturing Āpastamba V1s throughout the southern half of Bhārata and
beyond. Now, recall the great Mṛtyulāṅgala incantation. It is a powerful
but also an extremely dangerous incantation. It is important that you
periodically keep repeating it, if not daily. The biggest danger from
the sprite lies in interfering with the performance and recall of this
mantra — this can prove fatal to the victim. While I have never
encountered an Āpastambagraha before, I have heard of such a fatality in
the case of a V1 from the Andhra country. Now perform its nyāsa:  
Mṛtyulāṅgalasya Vasiṣtha ṛṣiḥ । anuṣṭubh chandaḥ । Kālāgnirudro devatā
॥  
Having done that do japa of it as per the form deployed by the vipraugha
with the bīja-saṃpuṭi-karaṇa that I’ll specify and not the aiśa form
heard in the śruti:  
ṛtaṃ satyam param-brahma-puruṣaṃ kṛṣṇa-piṅgalam ।  
ūrdhvaretaṃ virūpākṣaṃ viśvarūpaṃ namāmy aham ॥  
oṃ krāṃ krīṃ huṃ phaṇ namaḥ ॥

Somakhya then drew a circle and asked his cousin to sit inside it and
start a japa of the said mantra. He warned him that once Lootika
deployed the Ḍāmara-prayoga he could go into a trance and asked him not
to resist it. Lootika then came in having fortified herself for the
Ḍāmara-prayoga. She was a bit nervous from the fact she was dealing with
an Āpastambagraha with a nasty reputation. Somakhya told her to calm
down: “Lootika, the Āpastambagraha only possesses men, but as a male
graha with affiliations to the brahmarakṣas class, it does have a
tendency to grab V1 females without possessing them. I suspect he would
not have interest in possessing me as Āpastamba is not my primary school
but he could still lash out. That’s why I think you should deploy the
Ḍāmara-prayoga solo so that I can perform a shielding prayoga for you.
Yet, be warned it might break through; therefore, be ready with the
Vīrabhadrāstra if it tries to attack you.” Lootika then placed a neem
stave on Yaśaśravas’s head and right away deployed the
Grahavādini-mantra:  
oṃ namo bhagavate mahākālarudrāya tripuravināśanakāraṇāya virūpākṣāya
sarvabhūta-graha-vetālādhipataye rudrasyājñayā vada vada vada vada huṃ
phaṭ svāhā ॥

About 3 minutes into the prayoga, they noticed that Yashashravas was
slipping into a trance. A minute later, he started prattling like Aitaśa
of yore, uttering the single word — “Āpastamba-sūtra” in spurts with a
strange cadence. Lootika was taken aback by the first encounter with the
graha, but regaining her composure, she continued with the prayoga and
sprinkled some bhūti on him. He then signaled for writing material and
launched into few minutes of frenzied writing. At the end of it, he just
fell flat as though exhausted from heavy exercise. Somakhya sprinkled
some water on him from his kamaṇḍalu, and he returned to his senses
handing over the sheets of paper to his companions. “I cannot believe I
wrote all that stuff down while feeling like being in an almost
catatonic state.” S: “It looks like you have covered the first page with
many repeats of “Āpastamba-sūtra”. Not surprising. There are parts where
you seem to have doodled away in some South Indian script with its
typical twisting curves that we cannot read. Yet, there seem to be
coherent, understandable blocks. Could you kindly read those parts out?”

Y: “I used to be Gaṇḍalepa and was born in the Marahaṭṭa country. As a
kid, I seemed to remember elements of my past janman as a great śāstrin
of the Veda and was reciting the Aṣṭādhyāyi with svara-s by the time I
was an year old. I started learning the Taittirīya-śruti at age 3, even
before my upanayana. By age 12, I had mastered it and moved on to study
the kalpasūtra of Āpastamba, the school to which my family adhered. By
15, I had earned the reputation that if paṇḍita Haradatta Miśra were
alive, he would be the one studying at my feet. When I turned 18, I
realized that my scholarship would not support me, and I had a wife too.
I was desperate to get employment that paid better than the paltry
stipend I got from the Chatrapati’s fund. By the grace of god Viṣṇu, I
found sardār Khaṭāvkar, and he appointed me as his nyāyādhīśa, a job for
which I was imminently suited given my authoritative knowledge of the
dharmaśāstra-s. I also helped Khaṭāvkar with the commentary he was
writing on some Pāñcarātrika texts. Khaṭāvkar, in turn, trained me in
arms, and I became a reasonably proficient fighter.

However, Khaṭāvkar had an evil side to him, and it is perhaps partly due
to the association with his unprincipled acts that this fate has come
upon me. He was a partisan of the late Padishaw Awrangzeb and a good
friend of Nawab Sahib Daud Pathan. One day, Nawab Sahib hatched a plan
for a raid on Khargaon and asked Khaṭāvkar to help; I joined the raiding
band too. During the raid, the Nawab Sahib, to his credit, instructed
the men not to attack the temple of Aṣṭhabhairava in the town. However,
some Afridis and Bohras in his band disobeyed his command and burnt the
temple anyway. After the arson and looting, Khaṭāvkar observed that
there were gold and silver utensils of the temple and decided to loot
them. He was kind enough to ask me to join him and take a share of the
plunder. Losing my sense of propriety, I did so. Soon after that,
Khaṭāvkar met his end with the action the new Chatrapati took against
him. The gods may take multiple janman-s to punish you. Indeed,
Khaṭāvkar has taken at least four and is probably still experiencing the
fruits of his deeds piecemeal. I was spared and, under the patronage of
the courtiers, had an opportunity to perform śrauta rituals.

I became the adhvaryu for the great yajamāna Lakṣmaṇa Śāstrin and
performed several rites for him. However, in the course of that, I
committed acts that I should not have done. I kept out the Mādhyaṃdina-s
censuring them as false V1s, and I also kept out the Ṛgvedin-s from
being elected as Hotṛ-s because my Taittirīyaka associates and I could
take up their role with our hautra-pariśiṣṭa-s. An enraged Ṛgvedin put a
case in the court against me and my associates. We realized that we were
likely to lose it. I had exorcised a graha from an associate of mine and
kept it bound by my mantra-s. I decided to dispatch that graha against
the Ṛgvedin so that he would stumble in his testimony at court. I did
not realize that it was an Āpastambagraha. But the Ṛgvedin, Gore by
name, had some mastery of the Atharvan lore or the Kashmirian pariśiṣṭa;
thus he deployed a pratīchīna-prayoga. The moment he started reciting
“yāṃ kalpayanti…” the Āpastambagraha came hurtling back and seized me.
It interfered with my ability to remember the Mṛtyulāṅgala incantation,
and I expired six months later. As is typical of these Āpastambagraha-s,
they spawn a new one each time they slay a victim, and I soon became one
in search of a host.

In the meantime, Nawab Sahib had been murdered by another Nawab and had
come back as a liquor-seller. I hung out at his liquor-stall, making
occasional conversation with him as a friendly graha. One day, a V1
named Kuṇṭe arrived there and helped himself to a few swigs. I was thus
able to seize him right away and make him jabber just like you. However,
before I could finish him off, he was taken by his people to the
Piśācamocana-kṣetra at Kāśi, and a gaṇa of Rudra forced me to leave him.
There I hung out in a tree for centuries before I could seize the
snātaka who taught you at Kāśī. He had intoned the Mṛtyulāṅgala mantra
while on a commode, thus, becoming easy prey for me. He died earlier
that day when I seized you spawning another Āpastambagraha. Since your
family had failed to protect you with the Skanda ritual, I knew I had a
new host and duly took hold of you. I have not yet been able to entirely
break your defenses either because you have firmly maintained your
brahmacarya. But it will not be long before I’m able to bring your
chapter to a close. I also intend taking this pretty girl who had the
temerity to make me speak along as a slave maid for my ghostly
wanderings.”

Terrified, Yashashravas handed the script back to Somakhya: “I seem to
have scrawled another page full of Āpastamba-sūtra at the end … but is
there a way out of this? I don’t want to go the way of the snātaka.”
Just then, Lootika’s mother called her: “Lootika, we need to be going,
hurry up!” L: “Mom, we are in the midst of something important; I’ll get
back by myself later.” L.M: “Remember, you don’t have your bike with
you, so you have to come.” Thankfully for her, Somakhya’s mother
intervened: “They seem to be engrossed in their fun — so, let them be.
My husband will drop her back in the evening when he takes the offerings
to the Rudra-caitya.” After some wrangling, Lootika’s mother let her
stay. Just as that was settled, they all felt the ground rattle as if
there was an earthquake. Lootika felt her hairband snap and someone
pulling her locks: “Ouch, I fear the distraction caused by my mother to
my japa has resulted in him getting me.” Suddenly Lootika saw her bag
creeping on the floor towards the door: “He’s going for my
siddhakāṣṭha.” However, she managed to grab her bag and retrieve her
siddhakāṣṭha and deploy the mantra:  
huṃ drutam muñca muñca māṃ bhadrakālī-vīrabhadrau ājñapayataḥ phaṭ ॥  
With that, she managed to shake off the Āpastamba-graha. S: “That is our
chance. Yashashravas return to your japa.” Somakhya got out the nail
and, going over to the liṅga performed a kamaṇḍalu prayoga with the
mantra:  
huṃ namaḥ ṣaṇmukhāya huṃ phaṭ duṣṭaṃ graham astreṇa vitudāmi pāśena kīle
badhnāmi ॥

The nail leapt out of his hand and dropped on the plate with a prolonged
jingle before coming to a rest. L: “That was a close brush but I believe
we have him.” S: “Indeed, did you notice how he tried to dissimulate his
name thinking we may use it in place of an amum in the prayoga?” L:
“Hmm… I was puzzled by that and unsure if it was written in some strange
script, and didn’t know what to make of it. That’s why I made sure not
to use it in any prayoga.” They sprinkled some water on Yashashravas and
asked him to conclude his japa with an arghya using the Mṛtyulāṅgala
mantra. S: “Yashashravas, I believe you should have a smooth saṃdhyā
this evening.” L: “The tale of the late snātaka indeed reminds me of the
V1 who is mentioned to have been orginally seized by a piśāca-graha in
the tale of the Piśācamocana-tīrtha.” Later that evening, Somakhya’s
father drove them to the caitya, where, after the initial darśana-s,
they went to the sub-shrine of the Ātreya to deliver the offerings.
Since Lootika and Somakhya had a fear of dogs, they let Yashashravas
feed some curs while uttering vedo .asi ।. As he was doing so, Somakhya
and Lootika ran up to the giant, ghostly aśvattha tree on the temple
grounds and drove the nail into the ground at its base.

With the Sākamedha-parvan with the oblations to Agni Anīkavat having
just passed, we present a brief note on Agni as the general of the deva
army. Agni is presented as the commander of the deva-s in the brāhmaṇa
literature. For example, the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa of the Śuklayajurvedin-s
makes the below statement in regard to the ratnin oblations, which are
made in houses of the various functionaries of the old Indo-Aryan state.
With regard to the oblation to Agnī Anīkavat we hear:

araṇyor agnī samārohya senānyo gṛhān paretyā + agnaye .anīkavate
aṣṭhā-kapālam puroḍāśaṃ nirvapati । agnir vai devatānām anīkaṃ senāyā
vai senānīr anīkaṃ tasmād agnaye ‘nīkavate । etad vā asyaikaṃ ratnaṃ yat
senānīs tasmā evaitena sūyate । taṃ svam-anapakramiṇaṃ kurute । (in
Mādhyaṃdina SB 5.3.1
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Kāṇva SB 7.1.4)  
Having taken up the two fires (Gārhapatya and Āhavanīya) on the two
kindling-sticks, having gone to the house of the commander of the army,
he prepares a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Anīkavat. Agni is indeed
the leader (anīka) of the gods, and the commander is the head of the
army: hence, for Agni Anīkavat. He, the commander, is verily one of his
(the king’s) gems. Therefore, for him \[the king\], he \[the commander\]
is thus consecrated. He \[the king\] makes him \[the commander\] his own
follower.

Again, in the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa we have the following statement regarding
the offering to Agni Anīkavat in the context of the Sakamedha oblations:

aindro vā eṣa yajña-kratur yat sākamedhāḥ । tad yathā mahārājaḥ purastāt
senānīkāni vyuhyābhayaṃ panthānam anviyād evam evaitat purastād devatā
yajati । tad yathaivādaḥ somasya mahāvratam evam evaitad iṣṭi-mahāvratam
। atha yad agnim anīkavantaṃ prathamaṃ devatānāṃ yajati । agnir vai
devānāṃ mukham । mukhata eva tad devān prīṇāti । (in GB 2.1.23)  
These Sākamedha-s are verily that of Indra. Just as the emperor placing
the commanders in the head of his army-formations advances unchecked on
his path, so also, he (the ritualist) sacrifices placing the deities to
the front. Just as there is the Mahāvrata of the soma sacrifices, this
is the \[equivalent of the\] Mahāvrata for the iṣṭi-s. Now, in that, he
sacrifices to Agni Anīkavat (the commander), the first of the deities.
This Agni is indeed the mouth of the gods. Thus, he pleases the gods
through their mouth.

As an aside, we may note that the Atharvavedic tradition sees the
Sākamedha oblations as the equivalent of the Mahāvrata-s for the iṣṭi
cycle. The Mahāvrata is performed at the winter solstice. The Sākamedha
on the Kārttika full moon is the last full moon in autumn before the
winter solstice. Hence, the two are seen as being equivalent. Now, this
role of Agni as the commander of the gods is already hinted at by
multiple incantations in the Ṛgveda (reproduced in the Atharvaveda)
itself. For example, we have:

agnir iva manyo tviṣitaḥ sahasva senānīr naḥ sahure hūta edhi । RV
10.84.2a  
Blazing like Agni, o battle fury, conquer! Our commander, the conqueror
when you are invoked at the kindling.

Here Manyu (the battle fury) is implied to lead the forces, like
commander Agni. We may also consider one of the Agni Anikavat
incantations Atri-s:

uta svānāso divi ṣantv agnes  
tigmāyudhā rakṣase hantavā u ।  
made cid asya pra rujanti bhāmā  
na varante paribādho adevīḥ ॥ RV 5.2.10  
Also, in heaven, let there be the roars of Agni  
with \[his\] sharp weapons for the smiting of rakṣas-es.  
Indeed, in his exhilaration, his fury smashes forth,  
the defense of the ungodly do not contain him.

Finally, we also have the famous Rakṣohā Agni incantations of Vāmadeva
Gautama (RV 4.4.1-5), which present the most exalted account of Agni’s
war-like nature in the entire śruti \[Footnote 1\]:

kṛṇuṣva pājaḥ prasitiṃ na pṛthvīṃ  
yāhi rājevāmavāṃ ibhena ।  
tṛṣvīm anu prasitiṃ drūṇāno .  
astāsi vidhya rakṣasas tapiṣṭhaiḥ ॥ 1  
Make your charge like a broad front.  
Move forth like a mighty king with his troops,  
thirsting to charge forth slaying,  
You are an archer: pierce the rakṣas-es with the hottest missiles.

tava bhramāsa āśuyā patanty  
anu spṛśa dhṛṣatā śośucānaḥ ।  
tapūṃṣy agne juhvā pataṅgān  
asaṃdito vi sṛja viṣvag ulkāḥ ॥ 2  
Your swirling \[weapons: cakra-s implied\] fly swiftly;  
touch down on \[the foes\] impetuously blazing.  
O Agni, with your tongue \[hurl\] blasts of heat, flying \[sparks\]  
unstopped hurl forth firebrands all around.

prati spaśo vi sṛja tūrṇitamo  
bhavā pāyur viśo asyā adabdhaḥ ।  
yo no dūre aghaśaṃso yo anty  
agne mākiṣ ṭe vyathir ā dadharṣīt ॥ 3  
Send out spies against (the foes). He is the fastest.  
Become the uncheated protector of these people.  
Whoever wishes us evil from a distance, whoever from nearby,  
O Agni, may no one (enemy) evade your meandering course.

ud agne tiṣṭha praty ā tanuṣva  
ny amitrāṃ oṣatāt tigmahete ।  
yo no arātiṃ samidhāna cakre  
nīcā taṃ dhakṣy atasaṃ na śuṣkam ॥ 4  
O Agni stand up, stretch your bow against \[our enemies\],  
Burn down the foes, o one with a sharp weapon.  
Whoever makes hostile moves at us, o kindled one,  
burn him down like dry shrubs.

ūrdhvo bhava prati vidhyādhy  
asmad āviṣ kṛṇuṣva daivyāny agne ।  
ava sthirā tanuhi yātujūnāṃ  
jāmim ajāmim pra mṛṇīhi śatrūn ॥ 5  
Rising upwards, jabbing against \[the foes, pushing them\]  
away from us; make your divine powers apparent.  
Slacken the taut \[bows\] of those incited by yātu-s,  
be they kin or non-kin slay forth the enemies.

In the transition between the Vedic and Epic phases of the Hindu
literary activity, the role of Agni as the commander of the gods was
transferred to his son Kumāra, effectively also the son of Agni’s dual
Rudra. The stage for this is set deep in the śruti itself. As noted
before, the Kaumāra mythology is closely tied to the famous sūkta of the
Atri-s we mentioned above (RV 5.2). Already in the fragmentary Vedic
tradition of the Bhāllavi-s, we see the hint of this connection in the
deployment of the ṛk-s from RV 5.2 by Vṛśa Jāna for the Ikṣvāku ruler
Tryaruṇa. The Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa, explaining the duality of Agni and
Rudra, explains that the 8 forms of Rudra culminating in the supreme
Īśāna, the lord of all, are the 8 transformations of Agni, with Kumāra
as the 9th, evidently alluding to the very same sūkta of the Atri-s:

tāny etāny aṣṭāv agni-rūpāṇi । kumāro navamaḥ saivāgnis trivṛttā ॥
Mādhyaṃdina SB 6.1.3.18  
These then are the eight forms of Agni (Rudra, Śarva, Paśupati, Ugra,
Aśani, Bhava, Mahādeva, Īśāna). Kumāra (the boy) is the ninth: that is
Agni’s threefold state (i.e., 3
![\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
3).

This sets the stage for the final ninth form as the son of Rudra-Agni.
In this process, Kumāra also inherited to connection to the old
equinoctial connection to the constellation of Agni, i.e., Kṛttikā-s –
he is also their son, Kārttikeya. Also contributing to the identity of
the para-Vedic Kumāra are the aspects of the Vedic sons of Rudra, the
Marut-s, who are also seen as leaders of the deva army. For instance, in
the Apratiratha Aindra sūkta we have:

devasenānām abhibhañjatīnāṃ jayantīnām maruto yantv agram ॥ RV
10.103.8c  
May the Maruts go at the forefront of the shattering, conquering armies
of the gods.

Notably, the Maruts are repeatedly referred to as Agni-s (e.g., agnayo
na śuśucānā ṛjīṣiṇo bhṛmiṃ dhamanto apa gā avṛṇvata । RV 2.34.1c; na
yeṣām irī sadhastha īṣṭa āṃ agnayo na svavidyutaḥ pra syandrāso dhunīnām
। RV 5.87.3c; te rudrāsaḥ sumakhā agnayo yathā tuvidyumnā avantv
evayāmarut ।RV 5.87.7a; ye agnayo na śośucann idhānā dvir yat trir
maruto vāvṛdhanta ।RV 6.66.2a). This completes the circle of the
connection between Agni and the sons of Rudra, who are the
spear-wielding heroes of the deva army.

However, there are rare instances in the itihāsa-purāṇa corpus that
furnish descriptions of the martial Agni mirroring his role as commander
of the divine army in the śruti. We provide snippets of such accounts
below from the third section of the Harivaṃśa, the Bhaviṣya-parvan
(sometimes called Appendix I). The first snippet is from the narration
of Agni leading the gods in the battle against the daitya Balin, who was
subsequently trampled by Viṣṇu:

lohito lohitagrīvo hartā dātā haviḥ kaviḥ ।  
pāvako viśvabhug devaḥ sarva-devānanaḥ prabhuḥ ॥  
subrahmātmā suvarcaskaḥ sahasrārcir vibhāvasuḥ ।

lokasākṣī dvijahuto vaṣaṭkāra-priyo ‘rcimān ।

somapaḥ sumahātejā bhūteśaḥ sarvabhūtahā ।

svāhāpatiḥ sāmagītaḥ somapūtāśano ‘dridhṛk ।

dadāha bhagavān vahniḥ saṃkruddhaḥ pralaye yathā ।  
prāṇo yaḥ sarvabhūtānāṃ hṛdi tiṣṭhati pañcadhā ॥  
Red, red-necked, the destroyer, the giver, the oblation, the poet;  
The purifier, all-consuming, the god, the mouth of the gods, the lord;  
The soul of mantras, brilliant, thousand-rayed, full of light;  
With black tracks, with wonderful rays, the leader of the gods,
beautiful, the sole ruler;  
The witness of the worlds, invoked by twice-born, delighting in the
vaṣaṭ call, bright;  
The oblation-eater, dwelling in wood, self-reproducing, doer of all
acts;  
The purifier of all beings, the wealth of the gods’ tapas;  
The suppressor of sins, with a flickering tongue, full of heat;  
With helical swirling flames, bright haired, of the form of ritual;  
The oblation-eater, lord of past and future, the partaker of the ritual
share, yellow;  
The soma-drinker, of good great luster, the lord of beings, the slayer
of all beings;  
The unassailable one, the purifier, the power, verily the core of
beings, Svadhā’s husband;  
Svāhā’s husband, the Saman song, the filtered-soma consumer, holding the
\[soma\]-pounding stone;  
The god of gods, of great wrath, of nature of Rudra, born of
incantations;  
Having mounted the chariot drawn by red horses with wind-wheels, the
maker of beings,  
the smoke-bannered, the smoke-tufted, blue-clothed one, foremost of the
gods,  
having raised the divine Āgneya missile in battle, the great god  
burnt down thousands, millions and tens of millions of dānava-s,  
like in the cosmic dissolution, the enraged lord of fire;  
He, who is the metabolism of all organisms, situate five-fold in their
hearts.

The second short snippet alludes to Agni’s weapons and the manifestation
of the other gods with their weapons. This comes from the narration of
the fruits of the tapasya of the deities and presents the appearance of
Agni within the frame of the old Vedic ritual of the churning out of the
fire in the manner of the Atharvan-s of yore:

atha dīkṣāṃ samāsthāya sarve viṣṇumayā gaṇāḥ ।  
puṣkarād agnim uddhatya praṇīya ca yathāvidhi ॥  
juhuvur mantravidhinā brāhmaṇā mantracoditāḥ ।  
haviṣā mantrapūtena yathā vai vidhir eva ca ॥  
sa cāgnir vidhivat tatra vardhate brahmatejasā ।  
tejobhir bahulībhūtaḥ prabhuḥ puruṣavigrahaḥ ॥  
brahma-daṇḍa iti khyāto vapuṣā nirdahann iva ।  
divya-rūpa-praharaṇo hy asi-carma-dhanurdharaḥ ॥  
gadī ca lāṅgalī cakrī śarī carmī paraśvadhī ।  
śūlī vajrī khaḍgapāṇiḥ śaktimān varakārmukī ॥  
viṣṇuś cakradharaḥ khaḍgī musalī lāṅgalāyudhaḥ ।  
naro lāṅgalam ālambya musalaṃ ca mahābalaḥ ॥  
vajram indras tapoyogāc chataparvāṇam ākṣipat ।  
rudraḥ śūlaṃ pinākaṃ ca tapasā-dhārayat prabhuḥ ॥  
mṛtyur daṇḍaṃ pāśam āpaḥ skandaḥ śaktim agṛhṇata ।  
jagrāha paraśuṃ tvaṣṭā kuberaś ca paraśvadham ॥  
Having taken the dīkṣā for ritual all the troops \[of V1s\] imbued with
Viṣṇu, churned out Agni from the \[lotus/\] pond \[Footnote 2\] and led
him forth as per the injunctions \[Footnote 3\]. Invoked by the
brāhmaṇā-s as per the Vedic instructions, and inspired by mantra
incantations, and \[fed with\] offerings purified with mantra-s verily
as per the injunctions, he, Agni, as per tradition, blazed forth there
with brahman luster. The lord, having become manifold with rays, became
anthropomorphic. He is known as the rod of brahman, appearing as though
burning \[all\] with his body. **With weapons of divine form, indeed
holding a sword, shield and bow. With a mace, plowshare, discus, arrow,
shield, battle-pickax, trident, thunderbolt, he is sword-armed and
wields a lance and an excellent bow.** Viṣṇu is armed with a discus,
sword, pestle and a plowshare. Nara of great might is armed with a
plowshare and a pestle \[Footnote 4\]. United with tapas, Indra strikes
with the thunderbolt of a hundred edges. The lord Rudra by tapas has
taken up the trident and Pināka \[Footnote 5\]. Yama took the rod,
Varuṇa (literally waters), the lasso and Guha the lance \[Footnote 6\].
Tvaṣṭṛ took up an ax and Kubera a battle-pickax.

While the paurāṇika tradition presents accounts of several of the
ancient battles between the deva-s and the daitya-s, all surviving
versions aim to downgrade the pantheon as represented in the old Aryan
layer of the religion for magnifying their sectarian deities.
Nevertheless, we believe that the paurāṇika tradition preserves
relatively unmodified fragments from an older layer of narratives. This
is supported by the sharing of phrases with the old tradition (e.g.,
vajraḥ śataparvaṇaḥ or kṛṣṇavartman) and the fact that above snippets
are replete with Vedic allusions and metaphors. Both these snippets
present Agni in his old martial form; the first might be seen as
mirroring and augmenting the presentation of Agni in the famous kṛṇuṣva
pāja iti pañca incantations, while the second mirrors his emergence,
upon being churned out, presented in the above-mentioned sūkta of the
Atri-s. Thus, even with all the religious turnover, some of the primal
imagery from the old Aryan past continued relatively unchanged in the
paurāṇika tradition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Footnote 1: Notice the Vedic device of ring-linking in structuring
sūkta-s with old IE roots. The words kṛṇuṣva…vidhya from the first are
repeated in reverse order in the fifth of the kṛṇuṣva pāja iti pañca as
vidhyādhy…kṛṇuṣva to complete the classic ring. Then an intricate
network is formed by other linkages; for example: in the first ṛk, the
two hemistiches are linked by prasitim. In the second ṛk, they are
linked by the root patan+. Then 1 and 2 are linked by the root tap+;
prati links 3, 4, 5; 4 and 5 are linked by the root tan+ and so on. For
a complete graph, see Figure 1. Such intricate weaving is especially
typical of magical incantations, c.f. the Apratiratha Aindra.

Footnote 2: This is modeled after the action of the primordial Atharvan,
which is mentioned to in the śruti: tvām agne puṣkarād adhy atharvā nir
amanthata । RV 6.16.13a. This is a likely allusion to the fire within
water found in the regions closer to the homeland of the early
Indo-Europeans.

Footnote 3: The Vedic ritual of Agni-praṇayana with the recitation of

Footnote 4: The coupling of Nara and Viṣṇu situates this narration with
the Nara-Nārāyaṇa tradition of the epic Vaiṣṇava religion where it is
often juxtaposed with the more prevalent Sātvata tradition. This verse
hints at their “merger” by furnishing Nara with the iconography of the
Sātvata Saṃkarṣaṇa.

Footnote 5: The Pināka should be correctly understood as the bow of
Rudra.

Footnote 6: This hemistich has many readings. e.g., The Gītā press text
reads: mṛtyur daṇḍaṃ pāśam āpaḥ kālaḥ śaktimagṛhṇata ।; The Pune
reading from Parashuram Lakshman Vaidya reads: mṛtyur daṇḍaṃ sapāśaṃ ca
kālaḥ śaktim agṛhṇata । We take an uncommon southern reading which more
congruent with regard to the weapons and the gods.

This note has its origin in a conversation with Sharada. We originally
intended to incorporate the core of it into one of our usual fantastical
stories. However, following a second conversation with her, we decided
that it might be best to present it as a note of its own.

Vyāsa Pāraśarya was the author of our national epic, the Bhārata, in
more than one way: he first sired the protagonists, and then he recorded
their history as it played out. The queen Satyavatī had extracted a
promise from her husband Śantanu that her son and not his older son
Bhīṣma would take the throne of Hastināpura. However, to her bad luck,
both her sons via Śantanu, Citrāṅgada and Vicitravīrya, died shortly
after ascending the throne — an eponymous gandharva slew Citrāṅgada at
Kurukṣetra and Vicitravīrya contracted tuberculosis and perished before
fathering any children. He left behind his widows Ambikā and Ambālikā.
Distraught, Satyavatī first asked her stepson Bhīṣma to father children
on the widows; however, he refused to break the vow of celibacy he had
taken for Śantanu to marry her. Before her marriage to Śantanu,
Satyavatī was a boat-woman from a fisher clan who ferried people across
the Yamunā. In course of her duties, she once had to ferry the great
brāhmaṇa, Parāśara of the Vasiṣṭha clan. He was smitten by her beauty
and started wooing her with sweet words during the boat ride. She was
caught in the dilemma of her father’s wrath if she went with him and the
brāhmaṇa’s curse if she refused. However, the boon he offered convinced
Satyavatī to consort with him. He enveloped the region in a mist with
his magical powers, and they engaged in coitus. As a result, they had a
son, the illustrious Vyāsa Pāraśarya, the editor of the Veda-s and the
composer of the Bhārata. Thereafter, Parāśara restored her virginity and
gave her the boon by which a pleasant perfume replaced her fishy odor.
Vyāsa went with his father, and Satyavatī continued as a boat-woman
until her marriage to the king Śantanu. Now in this hour of need, she
summoned her first son Vyāsa and asked him to sire children on her
widowed daughters-in-law. Vyāsa agreed but stated that the Kausalya
princesses should undergo an year of preparatory rites before engaging
in coitus with him. However, fearing the dangers of a kingless state,
Satyavatī pressed her son to inseminate them immediately.

Evidently, from his being a yogin performing tapas, Vyāsa was in an
uncouth state with yellowish-brown dreadlocks, unshaven face and body
odor. Thus, when he had intercourse with Ambikā, she closed her eyes not
to see his grim visage. As a result of this “impression” of hers, Vyāsa
told Satyavatī that Ambikā’s son would be duly born blind despite having
the strength of 10000 elephants. Satyavatī beseeched Vyāsa to father
another child, as a blind child could not be a king. This time he had
intercourse with Ambālikā, who, looking at his dreadful appearance,
turned pale. Accordingly, she gave birth to a hypopigmented child.
Satyavatī then asked Vyāsa to bed Ambikā again. But remembering his
terrifying appearance, she instead sent her slave whom she had decked
with her own ornaments. The slave engaged in comfortable coitus with
Vyāsa, and he manumitted her and said that she would have a brilliant
son who would be the most intelligent of the men of the age. Thus were
born the blind Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the blanched Pāṇḍu and the wise Vidura.
Pāṇḍu’s troubles did not end with the absence of pigment. After his
marriage, while living a sylvan life with his wives, he shot a brāhmaṇa
and his wife while they were having intercourse in the form of deer. The
brāhmaṇa duly cursed Pāṇḍu that he would too die as soon as he has sex
with one of his wives and that wife too will meet her end with him. This
is the platform story for the unfolding of the Bhārata, with the birth
of Pāṇḍu-s through the intercession of the gods.

One may ask what is hidden behind the mythologem of the birth defects of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu? If one were to take a strongly historical
position, one could argue that they probably were afflicted by a genetic
defect. They could have had something like a variably expressive version
of Waardenburg’s syndrome or the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which are
associated with both blindness and hypopigmentation. However, the
language of myth has many layers. Beyond the historical layer, the
Bhārata clearly conceals divine archetypes. These are best seen in the
case of the Pāṇḍu-s but as the final parvan mentions, it applies more
broadly to the other characters. We suspect that the background of
Āditya-s was implied to be present in Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Pāṇḍu, with Vidura
representing the joint Mitrāvaruṇā manifesting as dharma. This suggests
that the blind Dhṛtarāṣṭra perhaps represents Bhaga (a continuation of
the ancient Indo-European blind deity motif also seen in the Germanic
Höðr) and the white Pāṇḍu combining the pale solar aspect of Vivasvān
and still-born Mārtāṇḍa, which comes forth in greater Germania as the
opposite of the blind Höðr, the white Baldr.

Finally, this mythologem also preserves a peculiar “para-medical” motif,
namely the “maternal impression”. While not seen as a real thing in
modern biology, there is a widespread belief that experiential
impressions on the mother during pregnancy might translate into birth
defects or birthmarks in her child. At some point, when we were
re-reading the Bhārata, we realized that the legend of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
Pāṇḍu was embedding within it this prevalent pre-modern belief in
maternal impression. Briefly, this view holds that ghastly sights of
amputations or deformities seen by the mother in real life, or in a
dream, or bodily transformations of the mother (like Ambikā’s closing of
her eyes or Ambālikā’s blanching) from fear or dohada (dauhṛda)-s
(satisfied or unsatisfied pregnancy cravings) might on occasion transmit
congruent or similar defects/marks to the developing fetus. We did not
pay much attention to it, but noted a parallel to the dohada of the
mother of the great Chāhamāna hero Hammīradeva reported in the
Hammīra-mahākāvya: she had a craving to have a bath in the blood of
marūnmatta-s when pregnant with him and that is said to have conferred
on him the fury that he manifested when manfully facing the monstrous
Army of Islam.

However, beyond that, we mostly set aside these mythic motifs until we
had a discussion with a late German professor in graduate school. He
brought to our notice a peculiar story reliably narrated by the great
Russo-German biologist Karl Ernst von Baer, a pioneer in the
evolutionary theory and embryology. Von Baer’s sister saw a fire when
looking out while she was about 6-7 months pregnant and thought that her
house in the distance was burning. She became obsessed with that fire
and kept seeing a vision of it constantly before her eyes until she gave
birth to a daughter in due course. Interestingly, her daughter had a red
birthmark on her forehead that took the shape of a flame that lasted
until she was 7 years of age. I was bemused by this case of “maternal
impression” close to our age, that too presented by a pioneer in
embryology, whose own work should have suggested that this is unlikely.
The late German professor mentioned to us that it is possible that it
had some connection to von Baer’s peculiar ideas of a “teleological”
force that influenced his version of the evolutionary theory.

Our conversation with Sharada brought to our attention the presence of
contemporary belief in “maternal impression” relating to birth
deformities and also reminded us of one of the morbid tales that our
late grandmother and her relatives liked talking about, which involved
such a motif. The possibility of a cross-cultural and temporal presence
of this idea made us explore it a bit more. This led us to the work of
the famous Canadian physician Ian Stevenson, who is well known for
investigating strange things like ghosts, reincarnation, and the like.
He had performed a detailed comparison of the published cases of such
“maternal impressions” and uncovered some strange cases himself. One
such notable case that he details is from Lankā, where a certain Siṁhala
rowdy was killed by his adversaries, who chopped off both his hands. It
was said that the rowdy’s mother then invoked Viṣṇu and Skanda to bring
such a fate upon the child of his killer and repeatedly cursed the
killer’s wife that she would have a deformed child. Subsequently, the
assailant’s wife gave birth to a son lacking arms – a birth defect
closely paralleling the amputations the rowdy was subject to. The
deformed child died within an year or two of birth. Stevenson stressed
that the deformities, of which he produced a photograph, were unusual
and that there was no history of genetic defects in the family as far as
his extensive investigations could tell.

In a detailed study, Stevenson gathered at least 50 cases that he
considered reliable (they corresponded to rare defects, and in his
estimation, in 46 of the 50 cases the similarly rare maternal impression
corresponded very closely to the lesion in the neonate) and analyzed
them for general tendencies. In 41/50 cases, he reported the pregnant
mother directly seeing or hearing about a lesion (which may be a wound,
surgery, or something else) in another person. In 6 cases, she
experienced something on herself — these are more comparable to those of
the Kausalya princesses of our national epic. Stevenson describes some
of the cases in greater detail. One was reported in the British Medical
Journal in 1886. Here a woman in the 4th month of her pregnancy dreamt
that a rat had bitten off the great toe of her right foot. Consequently,
“she awoke screaming, and narrated the cause of her fright to her
husband, who corroborated her statement”. When she delivered her child,
it lacked the very same great toe she lost in her dream. This case may
be compared to the examples of Kausalya princesses, in that the
impression was not the sight of a lesion in someone else but in the
mother. However, the one distinguishing feature of the epic example is
that the premonitory impression happened at conception rather than
pregnancy proper.

By considering an additional set of less reliable cases, Stevenson drew
up a more extensive list of 113 cases of maternal impressions. In this
set, he found 80 cases with the impression in the first trimester, 20 in
the second, and 13 in the third, which, as he noted, is a statistically
significant difference ![(\\chi^2= 72.018, p =
2.299^{-16})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cchi%5E2%3D+72.018%2C+p+%3D+2.299%5E%7B-16%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The significant over-representation in the first trimester is aligned
with that period being the most susceptible period in pregnancy for
birth defects from biological causes. For example, it is well-known that
severe alcohol abuse during the first trimester can disrupt the
development of the head, resulting in birth defects. Similarly, studies
on the teratogenicity of high (>10000 IU) doses of vitamin A suggest
that birth defects were concentrated among the babies born to women who
had consumed it before the seventh week of gestation. Importantly, it
maps to the period when morning sickness is most prevalent, which itself
seems to be an adaptation to protect the fetus in early development from
potentially teratogenic compounds in the food. Thus, it also corresponds
to the peak period of defects from the ubiquitination-activating drug
thalidomide that was wrongly used to treat morning sickness (we shall
return to its action below).

From Stevenson’s cases, which are mostly from Occidental cultures and
relatively close to our times (1700-1900s), it became clear that the
idea of maternal impression is indeed a widespread cross-cultural one
with arborizations into other “mystery” phenomena like abhicāra and
reincarnation. This made us revisit the old Hindu medical tradition to
consider the positions they held in this regard. As a representative, we
may consider one of the great authoritative texts of early Hindu
medicine: the Śarīra-sthāna of the Suśruta-saṃhitā, which starts of with
an ancient theory of being. Following the sāṃkhya tradition, it lays out
that from the primordial matter prakṛti, various organs constituting the
body arose. While these organs are seen as being made up of matter
(bhautika
![\\to](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
adhibhūta), i.e., transformations (vikārāḥ) of prakṛti, they are said to
have mapping on the realm of consciousness (adhyātma) and the sphere of
the gods (adhidaivata; which cuts across the material and conscious
realms in a “Platonic sense”). This mapping to the gods derived from the
Yajurveda (with some parallels to the puruṣa-sūkta-s and central to the
nyāsa-s of later tradition) is stated thus in Suśruta:

sva svaś caiṣāṃ viṣayo .adhibhūtam \| svayam adhyātmam adhidaivtaṃ ca \|
atha buddhe brahmā \| ahaṃkārasyeśvaraḥ \| manaś candramā \| diśaḥ
śrotrasya \| tvaco vāyuḥ \| sūryaś cakṣoḥ \| rasanasya+āpaḥ \| pṛthivī
ghṛāṇasya \| vaco .agniḥ \| hastayor indraḥ \| pādayor viṣṇuḥ \| pāyor
mitraḥ \| prajāpatir upasthyeti \| tatra sarva evācetana eṣa vargaḥ \|
puruṣaḥ pañcaviṃśatitamaḥ sa ca kārya-kāraṇa-saṃyuktaś cetayitā bhavati
\|\|  
The mapping is thus: Brahmā: intellect; Īśvara (Rudra): I-ness (personal
identity); Moon: mind; directions: hearing; Vāyu: skin; Sun: eyes;
waters: tongue; Earth: nose; Agni: vocal system; Indra: prehensile
organs; Viṣṇu: locomotory organs; Mitra: excretory organs; Prajāpati:
reproductive organs. The final sentence clarifies that while the
evolutes of prakṛti are by themselves unconscious, the 25th tattva,
puruṣa, enters the primal cause (prakṛti) and its evolutes and endows
them its nature consciousness. We layout this sāṃkhya foundation of
Hindu medicine because it is via that intersection of the realm of
consciousness and matter that it tries to explain things that would be
seen as “supernatural” in a modern sense.

The Hindu medical tradition (like that recorded by Suśruta) has a
proto-biological understanding of specific issues generally pointing in
the right direction:  
(1) Unlike the folk idea prevalent in the Indo-European world of the
sperm being a seed sown in the vagina/uterus, it understood that there
was a biological contribution from both the parents. In the case of the
male, it saw that as coming from the semen. That contribution was not
visible in the female, but it postulated an ārtava — a theoretical
ovum.  
(2) It did recognize that there was some sex-determining principle
coming from the semen and the ārtava, though the exact nature of it was
imperfectly understood.  
(3) It recognized a “proto-genetic” principle wherein the parents’
postulated contributions gave rise to different organs in the embryo.  
(4) It presented a primitive theory based on “biochemical expressions”
in the developing embryo for various birth defects (including those
comparable to Pāṇḍu and Dhṛtarāṣṭra), atypical sexuality and
pigmentation differences.

However, superimposed on this essentially biological foundation
(sometimes with pioneering insights) is a belief in different forms of
extra-biological impressions. The roles of the various processes
involved and their effects are voiced by Suśruta thus:

san niveśaḥ śarīrāṇāṃ dantānāṃ patanodbhavau \|  
taleśv asaṃbhavo yaś ca romṇām etat svabhāvataḥ \|\|  
The development of the organs in their proper locations, the fall of
\[milk\] teeth, and the growth \[of permanent teeth\], non-growth of
hair in palms and feet all are \[examples\] of development as per the
natural law \[for that organism\].

Thus, Suśruta and other authorities acknowledge that basic human
development is as per a natural law — i.e., a purely biological process
typical of a given species. However, immediately thereafter, he cites
śloka-s that goes on to describe a very different hypothesis regarding
mental traits:

bhāvitāḥ pūrvadeheṣu satataṃ śāstra-buddhayaḥ \|  
bhavanti sattva-bhūyiṣṭhāḥ pūrva-jāti-smarā narāḥ \|\|  
Those constantly conditioned in the former bodies by the study of the
śāśtra-s become \[even in the current birth\] men endowed in sattva
remembering the former birth.

karmaṇa codito yena tadāpnoti punarbhave \|  
abhyastāḥ pūrvadehe ye tāneva bhajate guṇān \|\|  
Impelled by acts which he has performed \[in the former birth\], a
person attains his \[state\] in the reincarnation. Those activities
which were repeatedly practiced in the former body are also shared by
the \[current one\].

Thus, there was a belief that mental traits transmitted via
reincarnation from the previous birth, like an inclination toward good
learning, and behavioral tendencies acquired by constant practice, were
superimposed on the basic biological development (mentioned above).
Combined with the reincarnational effect (which parallels beliefs in
most human cultures across the world) were various beliefs that may be
considered as belonging to the domain of maternal impression. One of
these is believed to act at the time of conception or just before that,
as was the case with Ambikā and Ambālikā. An old verse cited by Suśruta
records such a belief:

pūrvaṃ paśyed ṛtu-snātā yādṛśaṃ naram aṅganā \|  
tādṛśaṃ janayet putraṃ bhartāraṃ darśayed ataḥ \|\|  
Whoever is the first man the woman may see after her purificatory bath
following her menstruation, the child she births resembles him; hence,
she must see her husband.

The commentators add that if her husband is not around at the moment,
she should see the sun. Thus, the impression of the first man she sees
is said to determine the child’s appearance. The old Hindu medical
tradition also records a variety of alternative causes for birth
defects, some biological and other “impressional”:

garbho vāta-prakopeṇa dauhṛde vāvamānite \|  
bhavet kubjaḥ kuṇiḥ paṅgur mūko minmina eva vā \|\|  
A fetus suffering insults from the derangement of vāta (one of the three
basic bodily processes of old Hindu physiology
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
humors of Greek physiology) or due to the \[unfulfilled\] maternal
cravings (dauhṛda), may indeed become hunchbacked, defective in the
arms, defective in the legs, dumb, or nasal-voiced.

mātā-pitro .astu nāstikyād aśubhaiś ca purākṛtaiḥ \|  
vātādīnāṃ ca kopena garbho vikṛtim āpnuyāt \|\|  
From the mother or father being counter-religious or due to their
inauspicious ways or from their misdeeds in a past incarnation or from
the derangement of the vāta and the like the fetus acquires
birth-defects.

Thus, while a proximal physiological cause (i.e., the derangement of the
doṣa-s) is offered, meta- or “supernatural” causes are also suggested in
the form of unfulfilled maternal cravings and the “impressions” of the
inappropriate ways of the parents in the current and past incarnations.
For the maternal cravings, the Hindu proto-scientists presented a purely
physiological hypothesis within the context of embryological
development:

tatra prathame māsi kalalaṃ jāyate \| dvitīye śītoṣmānilair
abhiprapacyamānānāṃ mahābhūtānāṃ saṃghāto ghanaḥ saṃjāyate \| yadi
piṇḍaḥ pumān strī cet peśī napuṃsakaṃ ched arbudam iti \| tṛtīye
hasta-pāda-śirasāṃ pañca-piṇḍakā nirvartante \| aṅga-pratyaṅga-vibhāgaś
ca sūkṣmo bhavati \| caturthe sarvāṅga-vibhāgaḥ pravyaktaro bhavati \|
garbha-hṛdaya-pravyakti-bhāvāc cetanā-dhātur abhivyakto bhavati \|
kasmāt? tat sthānatvāt \| tasmād garbhaś caturthe māsy abhiprāyam
indriyārtheṣu karoti \| dvihṛdayāṃ ca nārīṃ dauhṛdinīṃ ācakṣate \|
dauhṛda-vimānanāt kubjaṃ kuṇiṃ khañjaṃ jaḍaṃ vāmanaṃ vikṛtākṣam anakṣaṃ
vā nārī sutaṃ janayati \| tasmāt sā yad icchet tat tasyai dāpayet \|
labdha-dauhṛdā hi vīryavantaṃ cirāyuṣaṃ ca putraṃ janayati \|\|  
There (in the womb), in the first month, a bag-like structure emerges.
In the second, starting with metabolic action of the three (śītoṣmānila)
physiological processes, the molecular combinations of the primal
elements comprise a condensed structure. The presence of a lump-like
structure indicates a male; a bud-like structure a female; a tumorous
mass, an intersex. In the third, 5 lump-like forms of the hands, legs
and head develop. The incipient divisions of the various organs and
their subdivisions come into being. In the fourth, the substructures of
all the organs become clearly apparent. From the full development of the
fetal heart, the substance of consciousness becomes apparent. How so?
From the heart being the receptacle \[of consciousness\]. Thus, in the
fourth month, the fetus displays agency for the organs to
apprehend/elicit their stimuli/actions. There are two hearts (one of the
fetus and one of the mother), and from that the pregnant woman is known
to be two-hearted \[thus, the maternal cravings\]. Hence, unfulfilled
maternal cravings result in the woman giving birth to an offspring that
may be hunchbacked, defective in the hands, defective in the legs,
mentally defective, dwarfed, with deformed eyes or eyeless. Therefore,
one must satisfy her cravings as she wishes. Indeed, the woman with
satisfied cravings births a virile and long-lived son.

Thus, the Hindu hypothesis of maternal cravings stems from the old
belief that the heart is the seat of consciousness \[Footnote 1\]. Thus,
the full development of the heart causes the organs of the fetus to seek
their stimuli (jñānendriya-s) or actions (karmendriya-s). These are
expressed via the mother resulting in maternal cravings. The hypothesis
further posits that non-fulfillment of these results in defects in the
fetus. We still do not fully understand the causes for maternal cravings
or their adaptive logic in their entirety. The “spandrel” hypothesis
suggests that they might arise from the uterine nervous connections
activating the neighboring taste-related regions in the part of the
brain known as the insula. However, we find it highly unlikely that the
phenomenon is a spandrel. On the other hand, modern experiments suggest
that, at least in childhood, there might be a liking for the gustatory
stimuli the kids were repeatedly exposed to via their mother’s food
during their fetal development. It is possible the Hindu
proto-scientists made similar observations and accordingly extrapolated
and expanded them to propose the above hypothesis. Indeed, tradition
holds that such maternal cravings in themselves have a prognostic
character. We cite a few examples of these below:

āśrame saṃyatātmānaṃ dharmaśīlaṃ prasūyate \|  
devatā-pratimāyāṃ tu prasūte pārṣadopamam \|\|  
darśane vyālajātīnāṃ hiṃsāśīlaṃ prasūyate  
The woman with a craving to visit a dwelling of sages births a
self-controlled child committed to dharma. Indeed, she who desires to
see an image of a god births a child who would grace a council. She who
wishes to see a carnivorous animal births a child prone to violence.  
godhā-māṃsā .aśane putraṃ suṣupsuṃ dhāraṇātmakam \|  
gavāṃ māṃse tu balinaṃ sarva-kleṣa-sahaṃ tathā \|\|  
She who wants to eat the meat of a *Varanus* lizard births a child who
will sleep well and cling to material possessions. Similarly, she who
craves for beef births a strong child capable of enduring all manner of
hardships.  
māhiṣe dauhṛdāc chūraṃ raktākṣaṃ loma-saṃyutam \|  
vārāha-māṃsāt svapnāluṃ śūraṃ saṃjanyet sutam \|\|  
She who craves for buffalo-meat births a brave child with reddish eyes
and endowed with hair. She who longs for pork births a sleepy though a
brave child.

More generally, the tradition holds that the nature of the child would
mirror the nature of the animal whose meat the pregnant woman desires.
Finally, tradition also holds that there is a direct mapping between the
mother’s body and that of the fetus to account for the classic maternal
impressions:

doṣābhighātair garbhiṇyā yo yo bhāgaḥ prapīḍyate \|  
sa sa bhāgaḥ śiśos tasya garbhasthasya prapīḍyate \|\|  
Whichever part of the pregnant woman’s body is afflicted by
physiological derangement or by injury, the corresponding part of the
child in the uterus is afflicted.

In conclusion, we can summarize the old Hindu medical tradition’s
position on fetal development as involving: 1) natural laws expressed as
biological processes with parental “genetic contributions” as the
primary drivers of development; 2) impressions of past incarnations of
the child; 3) impressions from deeds of parents in current and past
incarnations; 4) fulfilled or unfulfilled dauhṛda-s, which are
physiologically explained as the influence on the mother by the fetal
organs exercising the apprehension of their objects; 5) maternal
impressions from the mother’s visual images post-menstruation and the
mapping of the insults to the mother’s body onto the fetal body. The
widespread presence of the impressionist components of these beliefs
across cultures suggests that they go far back in history. Apparently,
in some Romance languages, the word for birthmark and craving are the
same and reflect a belief that the unfulfilled dauhṛda-s spawn those
marks. The yavana physician Galen believed in the classic maternal
impressions, and Empedocles held that women who fell in love with
certain statues produced offspring who looked like them. Similarly, in
Greek literature, the dark Ethiopian is said to have given birth to the
fair Chariclea because she kept looking at the image of the white
Andromeda while pregnant.

A version of such beliefs played an important role in the history of
biology closer to our times. Had the French soldier Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck (1744–1829 CE) been blown to smithereens by the German guns
bombarding his position that he held with great valor, we might not have
had one of the famous debates in biology that is somewhat artificially
presented in textbooks. Having survived his stint in the French army
Lamarck went on to propose one of the early modern evolutionary
theories. Lamarck’s theoretical framework lay at the transition between
archaic and modern scientific thought — one could say the transition
between proto-science and science. His chemistry was more primitive than
that presented in early sāṃkhya, subscribing to a four-element model of
the universe and opposing the leap towards modern chemistry pioneered by
his compatriot Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier. Aspects of his biology also
remained primitive: on the one hand, he subscribed to spontaneous
generation, apparently disregarding the work of the Italian Fransisco
Redi that showed it to be a myth. On the other, he subscribed to the
existence of a “life force”, which among other things, “tends to
increase the volume of all organs”. Nevertheless, he was a keen
biologist who, through his investigations, realized that organisms of
one form must have evolved from those with another. A part of his
explanation for this process involved a hypothesis based on a certain
proto-biophysics of fluid flow. He argued that the rapid flow of fluids
within the tissues of organisms “will etch canals between delicate
tissues” much like a river erodes its bed. He then postulated that the
differential flow rates that will ensue would lead to the origin of
distinct organs. Simultaneously, he saw these fluids themselves becoming
more complex, giving rise to a greater diversity of secretions and organ
diversification. He combined this proto-biophysics with two so-called
laws to explain the evolutionary process. The first law postulated that
different organs of a given organism were either augmented or diminished
depending on the degree of their use or disuse in the course of its
life. The idea was based on the observation of real somatic adaptation
to environmental pressures happening in the course of an organism’s
life. The second law posited that these characters acquired during the
life of an organism by the first law are passed to their offspring — the
inheritance of acquired characters. In proposing this, he was more or
less following the broad class of ideas coming down from the ancients
that were similar to maternal impression in the general sense.

Charles Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus, who was one of the inspirations
for his evolutionary theory, also accepted the inheritance of acquired
characters, and Charles himself acknowledged this aspect of Lamarckism
and incorporated it as a subsidiary component of his own theory. The
shock waves from Darwin’s hypothesis resulted in a sizable body of
biologists falling back to pure Lamarckism or some variant thereof as a
counter to Darwinism that deeply disturbed them. One such was the
goal-seeking evolutionary theory of the German biologist, Theodor Eimer,
which incorporated the Lamarckian mechanism. Attempts claiming to
demonstrate Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characters went on for a
long time, including that of the famous Ivan Pavlov, but none of these
studies produced reproducible or reliable results. Despite this,
Lamarckism remained popular, especially in France, down to the second
half of the 1900s. A variant of it had tragic consequences in the Soviet
Empire in the form of Lysenkoism. Starting with the embryological work
of Johannes Müller, serious questions were raised about whether
embryonic development was affected by somatic characteristics acquired
by the parents. After Darwin, August Weismann experimentally showed the
isolation of the reproductive germplasm from the somatoplasm of the
adult body in mammals casting doubt on any mechanism that allowed the
Lamarckian changes acquired by the somatoplasm of an organism to be
transmitted to the offspring. The subsequent advances in genetics,
biochemistry and developmental biology over the 1900s made Lamarckism
look less plausible until it was more or less consigned to the history
of science among serious biologists.

However, by the late 1990s, a version of the “inheritance of acquired
characters” started making a comeback within the Darwinian framework.
Microorganisms, especially prokaryotes, show rampant horizontal gene
transfer. The horizontally transferred genetic material integrated into
the genome or a plasmid can then be transmitted to the offspring. Its
subsequent maintenance would be subject to natural selection. In fact,
the selection could act even before the transmission to the progeny; for
example, the transfer of a gene confers immunity to a virus or
resistance to a toxin (e.g., antibiotic). Thus, one could see it as a
process of acquiring an adaptation that is then transferred to the next
generation. Indeed, several organisms, like bacteria, have sophisticated
mechanisms for acquiring foreign DNA. This could be in the form of the
competence system that allows DNA uptake in certain phases of their life
cycle or domesticated viruses that can act as transfer agents for DNA.
Less understood, but potentially in a similar vein, are the lipid
vesicles derived from cells that might also carry nucleic acids. Thus,
the acquisition of characters encoded in the transferred DNA from the
environment has been institutionalized in many bacteria. Indeed, the
commonly cited prokaryotic immune mechanisms, namely the CRISPR and
PIWI-based systems and other systems we have discovered, can be seen as
variants of this process of controlled acquisition of genetic
information (in this case, from invading elements like viruses) that is
then inherited by the offspring. However, this is entirely within a
Darwinian setting with selection post-acquisition explicitly taking the
place of use or disuse as an augmenting or diminishing agent.

In prokaryotes, this transfer of DNA in part plays the role of sex.
Eukaryotes have evolved an institutionalized sexual mechanism that is
decoupled from ambient DNA transfer. Nevertheless, they too have been
extensively acquiring “ready-made” adaptations through horizontal DNA
transfer. That said, from relatively early in eukaryotic evolution,
there have been repeated adaptations for “setting aside” a germplasm
from the somatoplasm. In the unicellular eukaryotic world, we see this
in the ciliates, which set aside their germplasm in the micronucleus
while running their cells with a somatoplasmic macronucleus. Indeed, the
macronucleus loses a good part of the genetic information maintained and
transmitted to the next generation in the micronucleus. Of course, this
separation of the germplasm and the somatoplasm is the norm in
eukaryotes like the animals. Moreover, a similar phenomenon to the
ciliate macronuclear DNA loss is seen in several animals like the
*Ascaris* nematode worm or the lamprey, where part of the genome is shed
in the somatic cells. In vertebrates, in cells like lymphocytes, the DNA
is again lost or mutated as part of the generation of immune antigen
receptors. In the neurons of at least some vertebrates, the genome is
edited by the jumping of transposons. However, all these “acquired”
somatic changes are kept out of the germplasm segregated early on from
the somatoplasm. The origin of this separation seems to be due to the
genetic “addiction” pressure exerted by genomic selfish elements against
their loss by excision, as seen in the macronucleus or the somatic
genomes of some animals. This has gone hand in hand with mechanisms that
suppress the expression of these genomic selfish elements in the
germline. This suppression process is achieved by a class of mechanisms
collectively termed “epigenetic” or transmission of information over and
beyond that transmitted by the genome. Along with this, pressures to
safeguard the genomic integrity of the germline have also resulted in
strong blood-germline barriers in various animals.

On one hand, these discoveries have been the strongest strike against
impressionist information transmission, including Lamarckian acquired
characters — a consequence of the strong shielding of the germplasm in
several eukaryotes from the somatoplasm. On the other hand, the
epigenetic mechanisms have revived a version of this transmission
because they do seem to transfer non-genetic information
inter-generationally. There have been claims that such epigenetic
mechanisms might be behind the intergenerational transmission of the
effects of trauma. However, the evidence for such claims is rather
questionable, and at best, they remain uncertain to date. Nevertheless,
at least in some animals, like insects, there are other forms of
epigenetic information like endo-parasitic bacteria transmitted via the
germline (e.g., *Wolbachia*), which influence the sex ratios by killing
a subset of the offspring produced in matings that disfavor their
transmission. These bacteria often encode toxins to enforce their
“addiction”, several of which attack the genomic DNA of their host,
including, as we discovered, by mutating it. Thus, there is a
possibility of transmission of acquired effects through epigenetic
mechanisms that have developmental consequences in a more limited sense.

One of the major discoveries of modern developmental biology, including
ones we have contributed to, is the role of protein ubiquitination in
regulating development. A major aspect of ubiquitination is its action
on protein stability, i.e., tagging of key developmental regulator
proteins for their degradation. Thus, both the disruption and
enhancement of various ubiquitination pathways can result in a diverse
array of birth defects. As noted above, the mechanism of action of
thalidomide is via the enhancement of one of the ubiquitination systems,
which in turn results in the degradation of a transcription factor
causing birth defects. It is conceivable that other than toxic
compounds, like thalidomide, certain other stresses (or, if true,
transmitted epigenetic information) impinge on the ubiquitin system to
affect the stability of various developmental regulators resulting in
birth defects.

Coming a full circle, with an improved understanding of biological
processes, beliefs in maternal impressions in the broad sense, which lay
within the domain of mainstream medicine from the days of the ancient
Ārya-s to the late 1800s, were gradually excluded from it. As Stevenson,
perhaps, the last intrepid believer in it in the western academe noted,
these reports more or less vanished in the 1900s. We are not sure if it
is a useful avenue to revisit. Nevertheless, being cognizant of it being
a tenacious feature of the cross-cultural belief landscape, we believe
that it is something that can be better investigated with the sharper
tools that are currently at our disposal. We have a range of mature
technologies that span nucleic acid sequencing, biochemistry, and
developmental biology, allowing us to more directly probe birth defects
than ever before. These could be brought to bear more systematically on
the suspected cases of impressions — in the least, the conclusions might
contribute in a more humdrum way to our understanding of developmental
processes.

Finally, if one were to see a case where one is inclined to bypass
biological explanations for the “supernatural”, then one may ask if the
relationship between the impressing stimulus and the impression is
really causal or a manifestation of the mysterious “synchronicity”.
While those inclined toward the rationality of the age might abhor the
very mention of synchronicity, it may be simply something they have not
experienced.

Footnote 1: As an aside, we may note that Suśruta records that Śaunaka
proposed the head to be the controller of the organs and director of the
development of other organs rather than the heart: pūrvaṃ śiraḥ
sambhavati +ity āha śaunakaḥ \| śiro mūlatvāt pradhānendriyāṇām \|
However, this more correct apprehension seems to have been dropped in
parts of Hindu biological tradition for the more primitive heart theory
proposed by Kṛtavīrya

**The past**  
The dynamics of the establishment of the counter-religious unmāda-s are
of some interest. The pūrvonmāda of pharaoh Akhenaten arose from the
moha in his own head and was imposed on the populace due to his imperial
power. It was quickly erased by the actions of his successors
Tutankhamen, Ay and Horemheb and it never was able to take root. The
mūlavātaroga seems to have spread rapidly within a tightly-knit ethnic
group and soon evolved into an in-group marker. Hence, there was
selection against it breaking out into the rest of the populace because
its value to the in-group would then be lost. However, by being a strong
in-group marker, it tenaciously persisted by maintaining in-group
cohesion during military expeditions and raids against out-groups and
became the incubator for the future unmāda-s. An infective variant of it
first broke out into the general population in the form of pretonmāda.
In the early days, pretonmāda appears to have been comparable to the
mūlarug, providing an in-group marker for some “good-for-nothings”.
However, it acquired several memes from other natural religions in the
environs during this period, making it a stronger competitor. Armed with
this expanded memome, it conquered the Romans through a less-appreciated
strategy of subterfuge, martyr-creation and elite capture (see below).
Once in power, it quickly expressed that anti-outgroup militant tendency
inherited from its parent strain on a much larger scale. After a period
of expansion via this virulent mode, it oscillated between explosive
virulence (e.g., South America, Africa and Goa) and its earlier mode of
creeping person-to-person infection (e.g., Andhra).

The same meme-complex was transferred to the marusthala resulting in
marūnmāda, which codified “spread by any means” as a duty of every
adherent. Indeed, the learned māhāmada Ibn Khaldun clearly explains in
his Muqaddimah that it is the obligate duty of a marūnmatta to convert
everyone to the unmāda by missionary activity or force. He then goes on
to add that whereas this is an explicit duty of the marūnmatta-s, it is
only an incidental or localized activity among the pretonmatta-s or
ādivātūla-s (M 1.473-474). While he might be correct regarding the
latter, the former, in reality, are closer to his own. Nevertheless, the
fact that he explicitly mentions this as a feature of marūnmāda
distinguishing it from the other unmāda-s suggests that it has always
been more “in the face” with them. Ibn Khaldun had also emphasized the
need for a strong power, like the ruler, to enforce the sharia once the
Adyunmatta dies because it is this enforcement of sharia that keeps the
people doing the “right thing” from which their natural tendency is to
lapse (M 1.472). Ibn Khaldun himself furnishes the example of a North
African woman from the Jewish priestly caste, who, distant from the
ekarākṣasa core, reverted to a semi-natural religion and as a magician
queen. Uniting various tribes, she valiantly blocked the advance of the
rākṣasa-senā until the Ghāzī-s eventually beheaded her and her skull was
gifted to the Khalif. Thus, the marūnmāda thinkers clearly understood
that unmāda-s are maintained by internal and external enforcement
programs, without which they can break down and disappear.

**Coming to the present**  
These aspects of marūnmāda reemerged in the secular rudhironmāda that in
turn arose out of the matrix of “enlightenment values”, dear to the
deluded secular mleccha-s, which itself was a counter-religion to the
older prathamonmāda-pretonmāda matrix. While rudhironmāda inherited its
claims for secularity from the “enlightenment values”-roga and turned
its back to the ethnoreligious mūlavātula-śūlapuruṣīya roots, in its
attempt at universality, it followed marūnmāda and pretonmāda. On the
one hand, this allowed it to be easily transmitted and embraced by
people as diverse as the prathamonmatta-s, śūlapuruṣa-s, the Rus, the
Vāṅga-s, the Cera-s, and as an outer coat by the Cīna-s. On the other,
as we shall discuss below, its secular universality proved to be its
undoing. At its peak, rudhironmāda was held up by the Soviet Rus in the
great conflict with the Anglosphere and its vassals. However, at the end
of that struggle, the Soviet empire collapsed, and rudhironmāda failed
in its grand geopolitical objectives. While it failed as a geopolitical
force, it quietly thrived for more than half a century in the fertile
breeding grounds of the Anglospheric academia, especially among the
Mahāmleccha. There, it underwent a series of mutations before eventually
emerging as navyonmāda.

What rudhironmāda lacked was the religious facade of pretonmāda and
rākṣasonmāda, and this was a serious downside. While both rudhironmāda
and the overt unmāda-s struggled against natural religions, the latter
were at least able to offer themselves as the ultimate alternative,
i.e., the “only true religion”. However, rudhironmāda was not able to
give anything of that kind. As a parallel, one could consider the case
of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk — he took the Turks out of marūnmāda. Had he
reintroduced the religion of the Tengri-s, the Turks of Turkey might
have been a cured people. However, he failed to offer a different
religion in its place after removing marūnmāda, and sometime later, they
returned to it with a vengeance. A similar phenomenon happened to
varying degrees in the marūnmatta states conquered by the Soviets. While
it is not apparent to the casual observer, navyonmāda eventually
corrected this critical fault of its rudhironmāda parent — the religious
vacuum. Navyonmāda neither set out to do this consciously nor did it
converge on it right away or in any conscious way. Instead, these
features emerged organically via selection within the movement to fill
in the vacuum of religiosity created by the earlier rudhironmāda within
the Mahāmleccha academia. Navyonmāda gradually evolved this feature over
the period from the 1980s to the 2020s. In many ways, navyonmāda
resembled the religiosity of the saṃgha of the sugata with its
veda-virodhaka tendencies when it exploded as a potential religion for a
section of the anglospheric elite and their arborizations in vassal
states of the larger leukosphere.

While the religious facet of navyonmāda helped it replace pure
rudhironmāda, this aspect also created the foundations for their seizing
power by creating both in-group solidarity and the ever-correcting
“purge of deviations or moderation” as in marūnmāda. Coming out of
academia and originally filled with lots of socially low-ranked,
physically unfit individuals, outright warfare was not an option for it
to capture power. Instead, it tread on a path very similar to pretonmāda
in its early days of elite capture. When Gucchaka was the emperor, and
the marūnmatta-s attacked the Mahāmleccha in their big strike, there was
a huge surge of military and nationalist sentiment. The result was an
attack on several rudhironmatta academics, as well as moderates, who now
organized under the banner of navyonmāda. Gucchaka’s neo-con handlers,
headed by his deputy duṣṭa Vakrās, the matta Āṇi, and the
prathamonmatta-s, squandered the swelling nationalism of the mleccha-s
by engaging in the useless invasion of Iraq. That was followed by
throwing away a chance to normalize relations with the
marūnmatta-occupied Iran, and more troubles emerged for the mleccha-s.
Duṣṭa Gucchaka also set up a police state within state, and to date,
unironically rationalizes it to the Mahāmleccha by saying that it is a
“reminder” of the comfort they can feel. This police state, along with
the financial crisis which followed, strengthened the hands of the
rising navyonmatta-s when Ardhakṛṣṇa became emperor of the Mahāmleccha
confederation. While in part unhinged or even evil, the cara-s like
Himaguha, Harijaṅgala (anti-H), Mānavīya (navyonmatta) and Asaṅga, have
revealed the depth and the power of the systems, which Gucchaka and
Vakrās put in place for the pañcanetra-mleccha-s to closely monitor and
control their own citizens. While not in the face, like that of the Han,
it has the comparable capacity and only needed a willing player to
exploit it to its fullest.

Against this backdrop, when Ardhakṛṣṇa became the lord of the mleccha-s,
under his sympathetic rule, the navyonmatta-s started creeping forward
aided by his dala. A key factor was the coming of age of the young
students indoctrinated by professors in the universities into the newer
strains of navyonmāda with prominent religious (c.f. the marūnmatta
students from Gandhara in TSP madrasas — The Students). They were
available to work for Ardhakṛṣṇa’s campaign and entered the śāsana upon
his victory. In his kalevarā, they found their much-needed bodhisattva.
With the first of these navyonmatta-s in the śāsana, they could now play
filter and amplifier with their professors in the universities. They got
more of their kind, while they punished and purged those who failed to
fall in line in an alliance with the vālūkavatūla-s (see below). This
creep leading to the control of the mainstream media, the academia,
internet-social media-based big tech, and offices of the government (the
deep state) was rather deep by the end of the reign of Ardhakṛṣṇa. They
thought that they could easily usher in their preferred candidate
Jārapatnī and establish their regime with their power. However,
Mahāmleccha democracy actually worked, and Vijaya, also known as the
Nāriṅgapuruṣa, became the mleccharāṭ. He tried to push back, but he was
no Julian and full of his own insufficiencies and inexperience. Alarmed
by his victory, the navyonmatta-s now went into high gear and used the
Nāriṅgapuruṣa as an excuse for quickly pushing in their excesses. They
used all their instruments to constantly hector the Nāriṅgapuruṣa and
facilitated his ultimate uccāṭana by Piṇḍaka and his deputy Aṭṭahāsakī,
who was an opportunistic adopter of navyonmāda and their front-end
person.

**Analyzing the rise of navyonmāda**  
Now, let us take a closer look at some of the aspects of the rise of
navyonmāda among the Mahāmleccha. [As noted
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/05/23/pandemic-days-vaccines-and-war/),
when the Mahāmleccha became a superpower after their victory in WW2, the
world was never more starkly divided into winners and losers. The
natural resources of Krauñcadvīpa, together with the victory in war,
paid dividends to them like nothing in recent history. As a result, the
Mahāmleccha started building sprawling suburbs and zoomed around their
vast frontier lands in their gas-guzzlers. This prosperity made them
more and more detached from reality, and the myth of infinite “economic
expansion” took root in them, making them blind to how unsustainable
this was. This softened their elite, worsened their health, and also
precipitated the decline of conventional ekarākṣasa religion in a
section of their elite. This left them in need of other avenues for
feeling a sense of “virtue” and piety. In our opinion, this
psychological complex plowed the soil for navyonmāda to take root
eventually.

As this was taking place over half a century, there were parallel
developments in academia. The victory in WW2, the triumphs of the
nuclear bomb, the shift of the epicenter of frontier physics from
Śulapuruṣīya to Krauñcadvīpa, and James Watson’s role in the founding of
molecular biology, made the Mahāmleccha academia emerge as a potent
accreditation system. But over time, the myth of infinite expansion took
root in these systems, turning them into pyramid schemes. One
consequence of this was what some mleccha academics have termed “elite
production”. Having spent a lot of time with mleccha academics, we can
say that there are some very tāthāgatan qualities therein — a mix of a
tendency for plagiarism and lack of attention to detail and subtlety.
The result is the dominance of mediocre or half-baked models of
understanding over more complete and nuanced ones. This is nowhere more
starkly illustrated than the fake studies in psychology churned out by
the dozen, replete with manufactured statistics. “Cancer biology” comes
a close second furnished with photoshop artistry. This was mainly
because a part of the expanding Mahāmleccha academia divorced itself
from a test against the real world due to the fetish of “peer-review”.
Here, research gets acclaimed due to publication in “high-profile”
journals reviewed by peers rather than being a realistic description or
nature or making predictions that proved to be correct. This was yet
another fertilizer for the growth of navyonmāda — a system where one can
get away with fancy beliefs without checking if they hold in the real
world.

Indeed, this blindness to reality in navyonmāda’s priorities can be seen
at many levels beyond the obvious. However, it is a kind of māyāvāda
that not just takes the jagat to be mithyā but creates a mithyā-jagat of
its own. Most plainly, it is seen in the denial of biological reality in
the form of sex and race and its replacement with a celebration of
pseudo-biological shape-shifting. However, this permeates more subtle
matters too. On the economic front, the classic rudhironmatta-s went on
endless harangues about economic unevenness in society and acted on it
by killing or banishing the prosperous elite. In contrast, the
navyonmatta-s do not rail much about the material; instead, they vent
against something immaterial termed “privilege”, and their actions are
aimed at eliminating those whom they perceive as privileged. The elite
in normal societies either signaled their status or were accorded status
due to either distribution of material possessions or their praxis of
rituals. However, in navyonmatta society, the elite signal it via their
beliefs and claims of purity therein (elite capture). In this aspect,
they are remarkably similar to vālūkavatūla-s. A critical flashpoint for
the māyāvāda of the navyomatta-s came with computers masquerading as
phones and the internet becoming ubiquitous. This allowed commerce and
social life to transition to a virtual electronic world, completing that
sensation of a decoupling with reality, which the navyonmatta-s desired.

In such a system, the holders of the allowed beliefs rather than
producers of work that passes real-life tests are magnified by shallow
vanity articles as though they are the next bodhisattva-s on the block.
Recently, we saw such an article on a navyonmatta human geneticist, who
thoroughly mixes her science with the Nicene creed of navyonmāda, to
provide that facade of objectivity to those in that pakṣa. A mix of such
boosterism of particular types as role models and the sense of virtue
from these beliefs takes the place of a key aspect of religion — the
sense of belonging among the pious and a concomitant disdain for the
impious. Thus, the new votary of navyonmāda, usually from a deracinated
or shallow background, suddenly finds a new purpose in life by
professing it. It provides for beliefs that touch the human need to feel
justified and virtuous. These are often reinforced by actual mimicry of
religious activities, such as rhythmic chanting of slogans against
enemies (c.f. marūmatta-s stoning the “devil”), internalization of
concepts such as the “power of the word”, great fear of taboo words,
sacralized ethnicities and “martyrs”, marches resembling a religious
procession, and community-building with opportunities for sexual
encounters and “group therapy”.

Thus, the American university system slid from being institutions of
accreditation to those of degeneration, furthering the capacity of
navyonmāda to take over the systems. It was still not straightforward
because there were still many academics who still had to give up common
sense to adopt it. It breached this barrier through a series of steps.
First, it evolved obfuscation of language, wherein common words were
reused such that they meant something specific to the insider, whereas
the outsider saw them in their ordinary sense as words of virtue. In old
religions, for example, in the yoga tradition, words like gomāṃsa did
not mean what the commoner might take them to mean. Here, the intention
was to conceal secrets and repel the uninitiated (e.g., he may think a
yoga text is recommending that he consume gomāṃsa and keep away from
it). However, the intention of the navyonmatta-s was not repulsion but
outright deception — it was to purposely obfuscate the uninitiated and
unwittingly get them onboard with the navyonmāda project. This is rather
comparable to Tathāgata redefining common religious words like trayi or
ārṣa or sūkta (=sutta). Thus, the lay votary would not realize that the
Buddha is subverting the religion and get sucked into the śaraṇa of the
saṃgha. Thus, driven by the need to feel virtuous and pious, the mleccha
liberal academics vigorously adopted and supported navyonmāda, even as
unsuspecting lay ārya-s adopted the cult of the Buddha — after all who
would want to reject something termed the way of the ārya-satya-s or
dharma?

As they began winning votaries, they transitioned from a bauddha mode to
the marūnmatta/pretonmatta mode of counter-religion. The academics who
resisted navyonmāda, even left-liberals who had some commonsense left,
were attacked by the mobs of navyonmatta-s, typically recruited from the
frenzied student body. Some academics were kicked out of their
institutions, others who were too powerful to evict were sidelined in
public discourse, yet others converted under this pressure. The campus
riots, like those of the American Spring (e.g., in Berkeley, a hothouse
of navyonmāda), pushed the growing body of university administrators
into submission to the demands of the self-righteous navyonmatta-s. The
monoculture in academia allowed the capture of institutions founded on
it like scientific and medical journals, which now amplified the message
and pushed the credo onto young and impressionable minds. Those who
sought accreditation from these bodies (academia and journals) had to
now submit to the new religion, and the rest had to go silent like
Thabit ibn Qurra.

In the next step, these newly minted young navyonmatta-s gushing out of
the big-name universities flooded corporations and the government. Those
who took navyonmāda lightly used to jocularly remark that when these
indoctrinated students get a real job, they would be jolted out of their
unmāda into reality. This might have indeed happened in the past with
rudhironmāda, as we saw with our own classmates. However, here the
reverse occurred. The navyonmatta-s captured and transformed the
institutions they invaded. In the days of old rudhironmāda, they
presented themselves in opposition to the “capitalist” corporations and
“oppressive” government. However, navyonmatta was more agile and worked
with the corporations — if the corporations paid them a jaziya and
supported their demands they were more than happy to play along and
support the corporations. This was an easy way for corporations to
appear virtuous too. Like a king who might have committed sins in war,
building a temple to expiate those, the corporations were more than
happy to absolve themselves of capitalistic excesses by adopting
navyonmāda themselves. The mahāduṣṭa-s like guggulu, Dvāra, Mukhagiri,
Jaka and Bejha all adopted navyonmāda to differing degrees as a
prāyaścitta while continuing to commit “capitalistic sins”. Thus, came
about the marriage of these with navyonmāda, which would have been
impossible under the old rudhironmāda, which would have attacked them
for their wealth. A very real exhibition of this was the repainting of
“the occupy movement” working under the old rudhironmāda premises to its
new navyonmāda colors.

More sinister than even these was the māhāduṣṭa Sora, who had always
channeled his money into navyonmāda being philosophically in union with
it. He saw it as an opportunity to enact his grand political plans both
among the Mahāmleccha and abroad, like in Bhārata. Among the
Mahāmleccha, he saw navyonmāda as a potential private army to put his
pakṣa headed by the vṛddha Piṇḍaka on the āsandi. In this, he was mostly
aligned with other mahāduṣṭa-s. They got their golden chance when the
pandemic lock-downs followed by some egregious acts of violence by
daṇḍaka-s on kṛṣṇa-s caused a janakopa. This janakopa was quickly
channelized by kālāmukha militant wing of the navyonmatta-s (c.f. the
Mahāmlecchīya gardabha-pakṣa’s earlier militant — the ka-trayam deployed
against kṛṣṇa-s). This provoked quick and correct action against them by
the then mleccheśa, Nāriṅgapuruṣa. However, his effort was rendered
toothless as the navyonmatta-s had subverted the deep-state and the
Sorādi māhāduṣṭa-s used their riches to provide legal impunity to their
kālāmukha rioters aided by the likes of Aṭṭahāsakī.

**“Rus! Rus!” and Cīna-capeṭa**  
As navyonmāda’s priorities are not aligned with the real world, its
adoption by the elite would eventually be hit by the real world.
However, this does not mean a correction will be immediate, as
illustrated by the Dark Ages in the Occident brought on by pretonmāda.
With the sailing being smooth for the Mahāmleccha, the deep-state actors
kept themselves busy going blue in the face, shouting, “Russia!
Russia!”, even as the storm of the Middle Kingdom Corruption was brewing
in the Orient. As the said corruption broke out of China, the
Mahāmleccha were oblivious even to their own intelligence agencies;
instead, they were busy in an internal conflict, with the deep-state and
the gardabha-pakṣa trying to overthrow the Nāriṅgapuruṣa. Finally, when
the Middle Kingdom Corruption reached the shores of Krauñcadvīpa, the
gardabha-pakṣa was trying hard to prevent the appropriate steps from
being taken to counter it. The compromised deep-state could not mobilize
a proper supply of masks for the citizens or even guda-pramṛja-s for the
mleccha-s to sanitize themselves. The result was a massive death toll,
the full extent of which has definitely been under-reported. To top it
all up, the mleccha-senānī betrayed his own boss, the Nāriṅgapuruṣa, to
the cīna-s. Cīna-s saw an opportunity to hit hard at Mahāmleccha power
using navyonmāda. Even as the navyonmatta-s disparaging their own
constitution, the Cīna-dūta-s gave the mūlavātūla Nimeṣaka and the
Mahāmleccha praṇidhipa as resounding slap right in their own den.
However, lost in the world of their own making, they failed to wake up —
Nimeṣaka was more concerned about flying navyonmāda’s Indracāpadhvaja-s
at mleccha-dūtaśālā-s than managing the proper retreat of the mleccha-s
from Gandhāra. As icing on the cake of their delusions, Piṇḍaka and
Nimeṣaka declared that they had conducted a great operation to kill
dreaded ghazi-s of the Khilafat and avenge the death of their baṭa-s,
when in reality they killed a bunch of children of one of their own
marūmatta friends.

In contrast, emperor Xi proceeded with strengthening the Cīna-s. He lied
his way through the Middle Kingdom Corruption, even as the rest of the
world was tied down by it. He delivered a definitive punch to the
restive vālūkavatūla-s, whom the Han had earlier subjugated. He was able
to move ahead with testing hypersonic missiles supposedly. Notably, he
was above to exploit the navyonmatta movements, like the
kṛṣṇajīvāndolana, to aid the overthrow of the antagonistic
Vijaya-nāma-vyāpārin and bring the pliable Piṇḍaka on the āsandi — it is
notable how the Cīna-s colluded with the tech-duṣṭa-s to silence any
discussion on Vyādha-piṇḍaka and his yantra. The cīna-s have other
assets. First, their penetration of the Occidental academia via
[Galtonism](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-euro-american-academic-system-few-more-thoughts/)
is incredibly deep. Thus, mleccha academics bat for their interests,
provide them with cutting-edge knowledge, and might even obtain funds
for their research which might ultimately be to the detriment of the
mleccha-s themselves. This also provides them a conduit to slip in their
spaś-es as students. Second, they have cultivated assets among the
big-tech duṣṭa-s, e.g., Mukhagiri is their jāmātṛ who originally courted
them before they broke up with him. Perhaps, even the break was not of
his own accord but due to the pressure from the mleccha side. Finally,
since the mleccha big-tech depends on delivering cheap opiates to the
masses, the cīna-s hold them by their balls by controlling
manufacturing. Thus, as big-tech takes control of the Mahāmleccha as the
de facto government (something which will accelerate with the strides
being taken in machine learning and other areas of computing, which in
turn have been made effective by the more than two decades of data the
masses have supplied them), the leverage on them that the cīna-s have,
coupled with their immunity from them, would allow them to use
navyonmāda as a potent weapon.

**Onward to Bhārata**  
All unmāda-s, the old counter-religions, and their new secular mutants
see the dharma as their natural enemy — what Viṣṇuśarman would term
svabhāvavairam. The one area where this is manifest is the hatred for
the brāhmaṇa-s and functional H systems. Those among the mleccha-s and
their sipāhi-s who fight for the so-called “enlightenment values” (the
older delusion) hate the H as they offer a robust and likely superior
alternative to their system. This threatens to undermine their
truth-claim that they have found the only true formula that succeeded
due to being good rather than being enforced by the smoking end of the
nālika. Across the mleccha elite, some of the predictions of the
evolutionary theory for *Homo sapiens* are fundamentally incompatible
with their cherished beliefs. Thus, the majority of Occidental
scientists (across ideological camps) focusing on its study slip into
denialism on one or the other matter. Both the “Western values” types
and those who fight for navyonmāda are terrified by the fact that H
succeeded because they created a system that instinctively acknowledges
the pulls of biology, i.e., human nature, on social structure. Thus,
Bhārata is the one frontier where there is an alignment of the enemies.
Paradoxically, while navyonmāda fights pretonmāda and “enlightenment
values” in the Occident, in Bhārata, these align for the break up the H.
In contrast, marūnmāda-navyonmāda alliance will be strong in both India
and the West. Hence, we predict that given the intrinsic lack of
fecundity in navyonmāda due to celebration of biology-denial it will end
up aiding marūnmāda in Bhārata.

Historically, H have had to deal with the preta-maru-rudhira triad —
while there have been the classic heathen failures against these, at
least they were recognized as such by a large fraction of the elite. In
contrast, the capacity to recognize navyonmāda is even lower, as can be
seen from the fact that even pro-H government circles so quickly and
willingly propagate navyonmāda memes. This has also meant that the H
elite have adopted navyonmāda memes to differing degrees. The secular
elite constantly bombard the impressionable with navyonmāda packaged
within opiates such as spectator sports, product advertisement and
cinema, as if they were distributing adulterated heroin. Moreover,
navyonmāda is also “safe for use” even for Cīna subversion operations in
Bhārata. In particular, government adoption of navyonmāda memes would
result in undermining the H army. This is something the Cīna-s badly
want because despite all their show of tech, they have a dearth of young
men needed to fight wars. On this front, the H still hold an upper hand,
but if, like the Mahāmleccha, they decided to adopt navyonmāda, they
could easily ruin their senā on top of having a tech gap with respect to
the mleccha-s and Cīna-s. We have indeed seen evidence for mass
deployment of navyonmāda by both Sorādi-duṣṭa-s and cīna-s — the CAA
riots, the various khaṇḍa-jāti riots, the kīnāśa-uśnīśa-riots and
Dravidianism — over the past few years. Hence, to cut the chase, we
argue that the rise of navyonmāda has not only greatly multiplied the
H’s threats in Bhārata and abroad but could be an existential threat.

This essay builds on an [earlier
one](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/huntington-and-the-clash-21-years-later/),
which overlaps in scope, filing in some historical details.

In our childhood, our father informed us that, though the school told us
that ![\\pi =
\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
it was not valid. However, he added that for “small fractions”
\[Footnote 1\] it was a great approximation. Moreover, the numerical
problems, which we would encounter in the tests, were designed with
radii, etc., as “round” multiples of 7; hence, it was alright for
vyavahāra. He also told us that in reality,
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was irrational and that fractions like
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
were only approximations thereof. We asked why
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was the best of the “small fraction” approximations. He asked us to
figure that out for ourselves but told us that we could get better
approximations with bigger fractions:
![\\tfrac{333}{106}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B333%7D%7B106%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\tfrac{355}{113}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B355%7D%7B113%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Armed with this information, not being mathematically too endowed, we
had to think long about it before arriving at an algorithm to understand
this. It went thus (written using post facto terminology):  
1) Given that we had a lot of sheets of graph- and ruled- paper, we
first sought to draw a line with slope equal to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e., ![y=\\pi
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpi+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This would ideally need the squaring of a circle. However, at that
point, we did not know of Ramanujan’s constructions and accurately
re-doing the yavana constructions with curves like the spiral and
kampyle lay in the future. However, we had those approximations with the
“larger fractions” that our father had given us, and with a hand
calculator, we could verify that they provided more than the accuracy we
needed for testing out
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Accordingly, we counted out 113 and 355 small squares on the X- and
Y-axes respectively on the graph paper and carefully drew the line
![y=\\tfrac{355}{113}
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7B355%7D%7B113%7D+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with a pencil that had an expensive, thin graphite refill.  
2) By definition, the line passed through (0,0). After that, we tracked
every time the line cut the horizontal (red crosses) or vertical (green
circles) grid lines of the lattice (Figure 1).  
3) We saw that the line first cut the horizontal grid lines at 1, 2, 3
and the vertical grid line for the first time at 1 after cutting the
horizontal line 3. The horizontal cut at 3 and the vertical cut at 1
come close to each other (Figure 2). This immediately told us the
obvious: ![\\pi \\approx
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
a reasonable first-order approximation, seen in several ancient
traditions, like the Ṛgveda, where it is embodied by the god Trita.
Going along, we saw an even closer approach between the vertical cut at
6 and the horizontal cut at 19 (Figure 1). This yielded ![\\pi \\approx
3.1\\overline{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3.1%5Coverline%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which again reminds one of the kinds of values seen in old traditions
like the construction for squaring the circle of the Maitrāyanīya-s or
the popular value of
![\\sqrt{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
seen in some old Indian texts or the value in the Rhind papyrus of the
Egyptians. At
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we saw a near-perfect matching of the vertical cut at 7 and the
horizontal cut at 22. Further ahead, we saw another close approach
between the horizontal cut at 25 and the vertical cut at 8, but this was
worse than the approach at
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It only got worse from there till the higher fraction
![\\tfrac{333}{106}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B333%7D%7B106%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
though there was a fairly good approach at
![\\tfrac{113}{36}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B113%7D%7B36%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(still worse than
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Thus, we had seen for ourselves that
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was indeed the best approximation among the “small fractions”. This
childhood experiment was to leave us with a lifelong interest in
irrationals and their fractional approximations, mirroring the
fascination for things like the cakravāla seen in our intellectual
tradition.

**Figure 1.** The cuts corresponding to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The only problem with using such a method for finding rational
approximations for numbers like
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is that you should know their value to a high degree of accuracy a
priori or be able to construct them using special curves. For example,
if you can construct a line of slope
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
you can determine ![e \\approx
\\tfrac{19}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Capprox+%5Ctfrac%7B19%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
— not as good as the approximation for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but has a nice symmetry with it telling us that ![\\tfrac{\\pi}{e}
\\approx
\\tfrac{22}{19}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Be%7D+%5Capprox+%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B19%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, for irrationals amenable to Platonic construction, e.g.,
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
this method can be used effectively to find small rational
approximations, if any. Thus, we can arrive at
![\\tfrac{17}{12}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as a rough and ready approximation for
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2).

2.** The cuts corresponding to
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

A few years later, these experiments led us (independently of any
literature on the topic) to the idea that every irrational number can be
represented as an infinite string of 0s and 1. We take a line of the
form
![y=mx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dmx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is an irrational number. Based on the above approach, we write 1 if the
said line cuts a horizontal grid-line and 0 if it cuts the vertical
grid-line of the lattice. Since the line
![y=mx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dmx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will pass through a lattice point only at (0,0), we start the sequence
by writing 01. Thus, by moving along the line, we get an infinite
sequence representing
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as a string of 1s and 0s. One can see that as the number of elements in
this sequence ![n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the ratio of 1s to 0s tends to
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, for
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the first 50 elements of this sequence are:

**01101011010110101011010110101011010110101101010110101**

We also represented the same as a “string of pearls” diagram (Figure 3).
This kind of representation reminds one of the differentiated cells in
linear multicellular arrays in biology, for example, the occurrence of
heterocysts in a filament of *Anabaena*. This led us to realize that the
irrationals have a deep structure to them that is not apparent in the
seemingly random distribution of digits in their decimal representation.

[![irrationals_Fig3](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/irrationals_fig3.png?w=533&h=367)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/irrationals_fig3.png)

**Figure 3.** The “string of pearls” representation of various
irrationals.

As we have seen before on these pages, this structure can manifest
variously. One place where we found this structure as manifesting was in
strange non-chaotic attractors, which were first described by Grebogi et
al. in the mid-1980s. These attractors are “strange” because they
manifest a fractal structure (see below) but do not exhibit chaos, i.e.,
the attractor has the same structure irrespective of the values with
which the map is initiated. The map which we found is distinct from that
of Grebogi et al. but produces similar behavior. It is of the form:

![\\theta\_{n+1}=
2l\\sin(\\theta_n)\\cos(x_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+2l%5Csin%28%5Ctheta_n%29%5Ccos%28x_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![x\_{n+1}=(x_n+2\\pi m) \\mod
(2\\pi)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%28x_n%2B2%5Cpi+m%29+%5Cmod+%282%5Cpi%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a constant for which we can choose some value ![l \\ne
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l+%5Cne+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
but we set it to 1.03 simply for the aesthetics of the “irrational
spectrum” (see below) and the manifestation of its fractal structure
(Figure 4). The other parameter
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the irrational number under consideration. Irrespective of the
initial conditions (as long as both ![x_0, \\theta_0 \\ne
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+%5Ctheta_0+%5Cne+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)),
the attractor takes the same form (Figure 4) that is determined only by
the irrational
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
as long as
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
remains the same. We term this the “spectrum” of the irrational. While
the attractors appear superficially like curves symmetric about the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
with positive and negative limbs, we can show that they are actually
fractal. The iterates do not proceed along the curve but jump from lower
limb to upper limb and vice versa, and between any two arbitrarily close
points on a given limb, one can find a finer structure of points jumping
between the limbs, thereby establishing its fractal structure. Indeed,
as
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
increases, the attractor acquires a structure reminiscent of the classic
fractal structure seen in maps like the logistic map. The spectrum
itself depends on the fractional part of the irrational
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4). This can be established by comparing the spectra for
![m=\\phi,

parts.

While this type of “spectrum” captures the structure hidden in the
fractional part, we also designed a second type of “spectrum” that
captures the structure relating to the rational approximations we saw in
the opening discussion. This is defined as the below summatory sequence:

![\\displaystyle f= \\sum\_{j=1}^{n} -1^{\\lfloor j \\cdot m
\\rfloor}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+f%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+-1%5E%7B%5Clfloor+j+%5Ccdot+m+%5Crfloor%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

Here
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the irrational number under consideration. Figure 5 shows a step plot
of
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for
![m=\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![j=1..300](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3D1..300&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We observe that it has a modular structure that builds up into a larger
“wave”. At the lowest level, we have an up-down step of size 1. Then we
see repeats of such steps with a transition between repeats at multiples
of 7 (red lines). This continues until the “trough” of that wave is
reached at 106 (green line). Then an ascent begins at 113, which is
complete after a further 113 steps (violet line). Note that the numbers
7, 106 and 113 are the denominators of the successive best rational
approximations of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, these sequences have a fractal structure with larger and larger
cycles whose size is determined by the denominators of the successive
rational approximations.

![n=300](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D300&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Hence, those irrationals with multiple small rational convergents tend
to show more “overtones” resulting a more complex structure (e.g.,
![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or

From the above plots, it becomes apparent that while
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for all irrationals will be fractal, at least small scales some show
greater “complexity” than others, e.g., compare the plots for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or

![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We wondered if there might be a way to define this visual impression
quantitatively? We did so by defining sequences
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the sum of the terms of
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in a sliding window of size
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For each irrational, we considered all
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
computed for
![l=1..25](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D1..25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then for each of these summatory sequences
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a given irrational, we counted the number of times the curve changes
direction, i.e., changes from going down to going up and vice versa. We
then normalized the direction-change counts with each
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a given irrational by the maximum number of direction changes seen
for that irrational. The mean of this normalized value gives a measure
of the complexity, i.e., the “wriggliness” of the curve. This is shown
as
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Figure 7 along with a plot of

Footnote 1: Fractions with small numerators and denominators

This note stems from a recent conversation with a friend, where he
pointed out that the graph representing all possible positions the horse
(knight) can take on the chessboard from a given starting square
produces interesting graphs. It struck us that this would indeed be an
interesting exploration to introduce neophytes into the graph theory and
computational exercises relating to it. Hence, we prepared this
elementary note for pedagogical purposes and to show some pretty
pictures. The origin of this class of problems lies in the Hindu
tradition of citrabandha-s and yukti-s, which have been extensively
discussed and illustrated by various medieval authors in kāvya and
encyclopedic literature (e.g. Mānasollāsa of the Cālukya emperor
Someśvara-deva). In his Śiśupāla-vadha, Māgha states:

viṣamaṃ sarvatobhadra-cakra-gomūtrikādibhiḥ ।  
ślokair iva mahākāvyaṃ vyūhais tad abhavad balam ॥  
That force was difficult to penetrate being equipped with  
the sarvatobhadra, cakra and gomūtrikā and like of formations,  
even as a mahākāvya furnished with such verses.

Here, he uses a simile to compare the military formations like
sarvatobhadra (comparable to the Roman testudo), etc., with the
equivalent citrabandha-s or structural constraints used in kāvya.
Several of the early medieval examples of such citrabandha-s in kāvya
are related to the description of battle scenes: e.g., the Haravijaya of
Rājānaka Ratnākara, the Śiśupāla-vadha of Māgha, the [Kirātārjunīya of
Bhāravi](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/between-the-rasarnava-and-the-chitrabandha-s/)
and the Jānakīharaṇa of Kumāradāsa; thus, it seems likely that the
authors were trying to embed images of the yuddhavyūha-s of the yuddha-s
under description in their kāvya, as suggested by the above verse of
Māgha. However, such devices are also used widely in stotra literature,
for instance to depict the weapons of the deities instead of the vyūha-s
— the Kaśmīrian Sāmavedin, Rudraṭa Śatānanda, uses such in his
Durgāṣṭaka. Since we first learned of the use of such structural
constraints in kāvya in our youth from the praise of Durgā by the great
Kaśmīrian kavi Ānandavardhana, it struck us that just as they have place
in illustrating battle-formations, they also represent an early example
of using ideas that intersect with graph theory and symmetry with far
more general implications. Indeed, even as the “Kavi-prajāpati (to use
Kalhaṇa’s term)” selects for such constraints to bring meaning to his
kāvya, natural selection picks such constraints in words formed by the
alphabet of nucleic acids and proteins to generate biochemical function.

Keeping with the military connections of the citrabandha-s, one such
citrabandha, the turagapada, is based on the horse’s movements in that
ultimate “war-game” which spread widely in the Gupta age, caturaṅga,
i.e., the steps of a horse on the chessboard. While we do not play
chess, we found the abstraction to be of interest. On an infinite
chessboard, the horse on a given square can reach 8 other squares
(Figure 1).

[![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/chess_01.png?w=334&h=336)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/chess_01.png)**Figure
1. Possible paths of the horse.**

However, some of these are unavailable at squares on the boundary or the
penultimate circuit on a board of finite length and breadth. For
convenience, going forward, we shall only look at square boards. This is
stated for an ![8 \\times
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8+%5Ctimes+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
board by emperor Someśvara-deva in his Mānasollāsa thus:

koṇa-pārśvasthitasyāsya turagasya pada-trayam ॥  
koṇasthasya pada-dvandvaṃ prānte pada-catuṣṭayam ।  
dvitīya-valaye koṇe haye pada-catuṣṭayam ॥  
dvitīya-valaye’nyatra pada-ṣaṭkaṃ nigadyate ।  
madhye ṣoḍaśa\[koṣṭheṣu\] sthitasya turagasya ca ॥  
padāṣṭakaṃ vinirdiṣṭaṃ caturaṅga-viśāradaiḥ ॥

In the cell next to the corners, the horse has 3 moves; in the corner
cells, it has 2 moves; interior to these cells, on the border circuit,
it has 4 moves; in the corner cell of the second circuit, it has 4
moves; in the interior cells of the second circuit, it has 6 moves; in
the 16 interior cells, it has 8 moves each. Thus it has been expounded
by the chess experts.

We can consider the cells of an ![n \\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
chessboard, labeled from 1 to
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by rows, as the nodes of a graph. An edge connects two nodes in this
graph if they can be reached from each other by the move of a horse —
the turagapada. The horse can make no moves on boards with ![n=1,
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Figure 2 illustrates the graph for
![n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One can easily see that the horse can reach every cell from every other
cell except for cell 5. Thus the graph is a simple cycle of 8 nodes with
one disjoint node 5.

From
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
board onward (Figure 3), we get single-component graphs with no disjoint
nodes. From
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
all the graphs have 4 nodes with just two connections corresponding to
the corners of the board, as mentioned by Someśvara. The nodes are
colored as per the number of edges connecting to them. This graph can be
rendered as a 3D object, which, in principle, could be the structure of
a hydrocarbon. However, it remains unclear to us if such a hydrocarbon
exists or can be synthesized in reality.

From
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
onward, we get nodes all the possible connections, namely those with 2,
3, 4, 6, 8. We have a single maximal node at
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
node 13, with 8 connections. When we render this graph using the
Kamada-Kawai force-direct spring algorithm, we get a structure with
bilateral symmetry and interesting relationships between symmetrically
equivalent neighboring nodes (Figure 4). For example: nodes 1, 19; 7,25,
both pairs differ by 18. The nodes 9, 21; 5, 17 differ by 12. The 4 edge
nodes 8, 12 and 14, 18 represent another such pair of symmetries.

board.**

These graphs lead us to the classic turagapada problem of kāvya and its
solutions, which simply stated goes as: can you find a path such that
the horse visits each cell on the board only once? In terms of the
graph, it can be stated as: can you find the path passing through all
nodes of the horse graph only once. In modern computational literature,
this is called the knight’s tour problem. The above graphs show that no
such tour can exist for ![n=3,
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3%2C+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For
![n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
cell 5 cannot be reached, but the remaining cells can be visited by a
closed cyclic tour path (Figure 5). For
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
though the graph has a single component, the fact that a pair of 2-edge
nodes connect to the same pair of nodes means that a tour cannot be
completed. However, 15 of the 16 possible cells can be visited on tour
(Figure 6).

From
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
onward, one can always find multiple tours that visit every cell. Figure
7 shows such an example on a ![5 \\times

board**

It is easy to see with the graph that solving the turagapada by
brute-force walks along the graph is very inefficient and will explode
as
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
increases. However, a simple algorithm for finding a turagapada exists:
(1) Start with a given node and move to a neighboring node from which
the fewest non-0 number of further possible moves are available. For the
possible available moves, only those neighbors which have not yet been
visited are counted. (2) If a tie occurs, then one simply goes to the
cell with a smaller index. (3) While these two steps are sufficient to
yield solutions from several cells, it is not foolproof. Hence, one may
look one level down to see if there are neighbors’ neighbors from which
the fewest possible moves are available to find turagapada-s with
greater certainty.

board using the above algorithm starting from cell 1. Given that
Someśvara explicitly lists out all the possible moves from a given cell,
he implicitly seems to have used a similar algorithm with symmetry
considerations to find a turagapada. He specifies it by first providing
a chessboard with coordinates indicated by the syllables formed by the
first 8 vowel conjunctions (a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e ai) of the 8 consonants
(c, g, n, d, ṭ, r, s, p). He then gives the turagapada asā sequence of
64 syllables shown below (Figure 9).

Other than this yukti presented by Someśvara, several kavi-s have given
their own solutions for complete tours. We have Rudraṭa’s solution in
the form of a prosodic pattern with repeating strings of nā and lī
interspersed between two distinct syllables, namely se and le
(supposedly you can use the principles of saṃdhi and samāsa-vigraha to
read this as a Sanskrit verse). His commentator, Namisādhu, provides a
mnemonic using the Sanskrit varṇamālā. Ratnākara and
Veṅkaṭanātha-(Vedānta) deśika provide pairs of verses with one laying
the chessboard and the other providing a solution tour. Rudraṭa,
Ratnākara and Veṅkaṭanātha, exploit the fact that the anuṣtubh meter has
four feet of 8 syllables each. Thus, they can cover 32 syllables or half
a chessboard with a single śloka. This solution is symmetric; hence, it
can be reflected to provide a full board solution. The widespread use of
turagapada as a citrabandha, from Kāśmīra to Drāviḍa, suggests that a
version of the algorithm stated above was imparted in traditional
medieval education.

This tradition was transmitted to the Mohammedans, and from them, it
appears to have been transmitted to Europe. However, to our knowledge,
the first solution appears relatively late in Europe, being provided by
Leonhard Euler. William Hamilton considered a related problem: let a
dodecahedron represent a graph with 20 nodes and 30 edges. Find a cyclic
path that passes through all edges only once. Here every node is
connected to 3 edges. A similar question can be asked for the
horse-graph — i.e., finding a complete tour that is also a cycle. A
solution to this problem is recorded in the late medieval encyclopedia
of Nīlakaṇṭha Bhaṭṭa (Bhagavanta-Bhāskara), but I do not have it handy
right now. In any case, a vast body of literature exists on algorithms
for tours and their use in kāvya; hence, we do not tarry any more on
this point.

Finally, few other interesting questions emerge from the horse graphs.
First, the diameter of a graph is defined as the longest shortest path
between two nodes of a graph. The distance between two nodes is a
geodesic — i.e., the shortest path along the graph. The longest such
geodesic between any two pairs of nodes in the graph is its diameter.
For the horse graph with ![n=3, 4, \\cdots,

we can compute this sequence to be: 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10.
Can one come up with a closed expression for this?

Second, there are

shortest paths between node 1 and node
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

this sequence goes as: 2, 2, 8, 4, 6, 108. A colleague of ours, a
professional mathematician, showed us a complicated formula that can
describe this strange sequence. While I am not providing that here, it
shows a dramatic jump whenever ![n \\mod 3 \\equiv
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cmod+3+%5Cequiv+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we see a jump at
![n=8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
making it more than the number of shortest paths found for the ![n=9,
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D9%2C+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, it appears the inventors of the game chose
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to provide a maximal diversity in the movement of the horse for boards
of a similar order.

In our youth, we read with great excitement old books on anthropology
obtained from a library with considerable difficulty. The excitement was
primarily from learning about the osteology of extinct apes and monkeys,
including the closest sister groups of Homo sapiens. Some of those books
also had a collection of plates with pictures of stone tools and various
extant peoples of the world, especially hunter-gatherers who still lead
a relatively archaic mode of life. Those pages too fascinated us, and we
spent many an afternoon turning through them wonder-struck by how many
different morpho- and eco-types of Homo sapiens were around. Of those
tribes, the Melanesian in particular caught our attention with their
gripping displays of headhunting, cannibalism and prion neuropathology
(there was still a debate about what prions were back then). The images
of Fijian tribesmen and a collection of their braining clubs left a deep
impression on us (Figure 1). We had a direct experience of the same when
we visited a coethnic who had been driven out of Fiji during the attack
on the Hindus by the former islanders. However, in his flight back to
the subcontinent, he had brought along one of those clubs of the
ancestors of his Fijian enemies. We wondered about how the Melanesians
and Polynesians reached their distant outposts in the Pacific. We also
wondered how these Indo-Pacific peoples might be related to the tribal
Indians — it did not escape our attention that some of that ancestry was
visibly present in the non-tribal Indians.

Answers to many of those questions have come from the genomics of extant
and prehistoric peoples over the past few years. In its present form,
this note is by no means a survey of all that. It is just a very brief
account comprised of a few observations sparked by recent discoveries.
Unfortunately, due to magazine-fever many molecular paleoanthropology
papers while presenting important specimens are poorly written and
illustrated. Also, due to the competing groups involved, the speed with
which new specimens are piling in, differences in interpretation, and
the terminological issues, these works do not afford a synthetic picture
of the history of the people under consideration. So, we have had to
wade through these presentations, which might ignore each other, to
summarize the below points of interest regarding the evolution of the
Asians and Pacific Islanders. At the broad level, the ethnogenesis of
the Eurasians and Pacific islanders can be summarized by this principal
component analysis of the genomic variation of extinct and extant
individuals (Figure 2). Some populations are colored distinctly against
the gray background of the remaining individuals and labeled. The key
prehistoric genomes are indicated by big stars and labeled in the
legend.

[![Asians](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/asians.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/asians.png)**Figure

One can see that a triangle of clines describes a major fraction of
Eurasians and Pacific islanders. The first is the Indian cline extending
from the Andamanese populations, like the Onge, Jarawa and Great
Andamanese on one end and at the other end terminating in the [Sintashta
steppe
culture](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/a-brief-note-on-some-new-developments-regarding-the-genomics-of-indians/)
that likely corresponds to the expanding Aryans. The Paniya tribe of
Kerala and Karnataka represent one of the groups from the mainland that
is closer to the Andamanese end of this cline. The second notable cline
is the Australasian cline, with the Papuans and Australians on one end
(close to the Andamanese) and the East Asians (Hans, among others) at
the other end. In between lie the Negrito tribes of the Philippines and
the Malay region (brown triangles), and the Austronesians who spread
into the Indo-Pacific from Taiwan in a maritime expansion, ultimately
reaching New Zealand and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) of the coast of Chile.
The third notable cline completing the triangle is the North Eastern
Eurasian-First American cline. The Bronze Age Okunevo from Southern
Siberia, the North and South American native peoples (including the
prehistoric Kennewick man from the Washington state of USA), Eskimos,
and Mongols are seen lying on this cline. Based on the prehistoric
samples we can summarize some key events in the ethnogenesis of the
Asians and Pacific Islanders thusly:

1\. Before
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
50K, there was an unknown number of archaic Homo lineages throughout
Asia all the way to the Pacific islands. Of these, the Denisovans were
widespread. We have direct evidence for Denisovan admixture in Tibet,
Mongolia (the Salkhit woman from 34KYA shows some Denisovan admixture),
the Philippines and the Indo-Pacific islands. The ancestral Asian
arrived in this landscape after splitting off from the lineage leading
to the Western Eurasian in the west. Then the ancestral Asian split up
into several far-ranging groups, probably by around 50KYA. These early
Asian lineages included:  
i. The Tianyuan-like Eastern group prototyped the Tianyuan man from the
Tianyuan cave near Beijing, dating to
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
41KYBP. A recent study posits that the Tianyuan man might have had up to
3% archaic Homo admixture from a Denisovan source. The Tianyuan-like
clade was probably basal to the later East Asian clades, which
eventually split up into Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian clades
ancestral to modern East Asians.  
ii Onge-Hòabìnhian group, once extending from at least the Andamans
(Onge, Jarawa, Great Andamanese) through Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia.
This group has been recently registered in the ancient specimens from
Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers from East Asia from at least 8000 YBP.  
iii. An early-diverging sister group of the Onge-Hòabìnhian clade were
the hunter-gatherers of the Indian subcontinent from whom tribal Indians
*on an average* get most of their ancestry (e.g., See Paniya in Figure
2). The Onge-Paniya gap in Figure 2 represents this deep divergence
between the Onge-like clade proper and their mainland Indian sister
group. Varying fractions of this ancestry persist in non-tribal Indians
with a mostly south to north gradient (“The Ancient Ancestral South
Indians” (AASI) of the Reich group). Today, other than this Indian HG
clade, the broader “Onge-like” clade includes the Philippines Negritos,
Papuans and Australians (Note their proximity in Figure 2).  
iv. The Tibetan hunter-gatherer-Jomon group, which once stretched over
Asia from at least Nepal-Tibet to Japan. These people played an
important role in the ethnogenesis of the modern Japanese. The old Jomon
were first invaded by a Northeast Asian population from the Amur River
region, leading to the Yayoi period around 3000 YBP. This was followed
by the classical Koreanic-type East Asian invasion of Japan, marking the
emergence of the historical Japanese at the beginning of the Kofun
period. Pure representatives of this group are extinct now, but their
Y-chromosome and some autosomal genome survives in Nepal, Tibet and
Japan. It seems the 2800-year-old Chokopani man from the Mustang cave in
Nepal had
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
16% of this ancestry while a 3500-year-old Jomon Japanese individual
shows about 44%.

2\. The Onge-Hòabìnhian clade proper lack high Denisovan ancestry but
their sister group, the Papuans and Australians, show evidence for at
least two introgression events with Denisovans. The Philippines
Negritos, too, had 1 or 2 Denisovan admixtures. Thus, greater Onge-like
clade spreading from India to South East Asia encountered Denisovan
races all the way from the Philippines to Sahul (the combined
Pleistocene landmass of Papua+Australia) and annihilated them across the
Indo-Pacific islands while mating with them on occasion. This raises the
possibility that the dwarf Homo (e.g., Homo floresiensis and the Luzon
Homo) on the Philippines and Flores were races of Denisovans. The North
Asian and Central Asian Denisovans seemed to have had larger body size
and a characteristic huge molar.

3\. A sister group of the greater Onge-like clade group or alternatively
a group branching close to the stem after the Tianyuan-like and
Onge-like groups somehow reached America and contributed a small amount
to the ancestry of some South Americans. While initially noted by
Skoglund et al. in the Amazonian tribes like Surui and Karitiana, recent
work by Brazilian researchers also recovered this ancestry on the South
American Pacific coast. To date, this ancestry is missing in the North
and Central Americans or their Beringian predecessors. This favors the
model in which this Onge-like ancestry reached the Pacific coast of
South America by sea (see below).

4\. Recently, Carlhoff et al. reported the genome of a pre-Neolithic
young forager woman from Leang Panninge, South Sulawesi dating to
7.2-7.3 KY from the \`Toalean’ archaeological complex. This is the first
genome from Wallacea, the Oceanic islands between the Sunda shelf of
Indonesia and the Sahul landmass of the Pleistocene. She is modeled as
having
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
50% of Onge-Papuan-like ancestry related to that seen in Sahul peoples
along with the Denisovan admixture seen in them. However, the best fit
models also suggest a prehistoric East Asian ancestry of
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
50%. The authors say this can be approximated by Qihe, a Southeast Asian
Neolithic individual from
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
8.4 KYA. This suggests that not just Onge-like groups but also the
Southeast Asian clade expanded into the Pacific, mixing with the former.
However, this type of
![\\approx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
50-50 Qihe-Onge-like mixture is no longer present in Sulawesi or its
surroundings. They seemed to have been wiped out in turn by another
Southeast Asian expansion, the Austronesian expansion from Taiwan in the
past 4000 years.

5\. Such a see-saw contest between representatives of the greater
Onge-like clade and the Austronesians of Southeast Asian roots played
out repeatedly over the Philippines and the Malay archipelago. This is
supported by the Southeast Asian admixture seen in the various Negritos
and the remarkable the ancient DNA results from Vanuatu. This cluster of
about 80 remote islands in the South Pacific is populated by people
speaking an Austronesian language but having most of the ancestry from a
Papuan-like group. Like Papuans, several Vanuatu tribesmen wear phallic
sheaths (koteka). However, the earliest genomes from these islands
suggest that they were first occupied by the Austronesians. But they
were soon joined by the Papuan-like group. These Papuan-like people
seemed to have wiped out the Austronesians on several islands, but the
latter seemed to have held out on some of the islands. These
Austronesians then appear to have made a return to mix with the former
and give rise to the extant Vanuatuans.

6\. If the Austronesians expanded primarily via the maritime route to
span a vast swath of the globe, another Southeast Asian group, the
Austroasiatics, appears to have expanded mainly by land and probably by
sea. These include the speakers of Vietnamese and Khmer in continental
Southeast Asia, Aslian in peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, the
Nicobarese in island India, Khasi in North East India and the Munda in
Eastern and North Eastern India. These Austroasiatics seem to have
expanded from the Mekong river basin as a group dependent on fisher and
some neolithic farming for their subsistence. One group probably arrived
in the Indian mainland around 3200 YBP, where they mixed with the
original Indian hunter-gatherers to give rise to the Munda-speaking
tribal groups like the Santhal (Figure 2). It is likely they also
resorted to a maritime route to reach Nicobar relatively early on.

Finally, we shall make a few remarks regarding the implications of these
findings for the modes of spread and various language groups. There is
little evidence for any clear-cut relationships between the languages of
the Andamanese, Papuans and Australians despite some claims to this
effect by some of the long-rangers. Nor do they show relationships to
Dravidian or whatever is reconstructible of the ancient Indian
substrata. This is keeping with their split in the relatively ancient
past when Denisovans were still around in the Indo-Pacific region and
prolonged existence as hunter-gatherer tribes. The Austronesian and
Austroasiatic languages are well-defined families like Indo-European and
show the hallmarks of massive, relatively recent expansions. Linguistic
investigations suggest that the languages of the Kra-Dai family (e.g.,
Thai) might be a sister group to the Austronesian languages. The genetic
evidence is not inconsistent with this proposal. The Austronesians were
the masters of maritime expansion — they probably reached their
Taiwanese homeland after splitting off from mainland Kra-Dai speakers.
From there, they returned to the Asian mainland and Malay peninsula
(Cham in Vietnam and Malay) and spread both East and west. In the East,
they first moved slowly, taking the Philippines and then around 3500 YBP
covered most of the Malay Archipelago. Over the next 500 years, they
took Melanesia and Western Micronesia. By around 1500 YBP, they had
swung west to Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Over the next 700
years, they took every remaining Micronesian and Polynesian island all
the way to Easter Island and Hawaii. The Southeast Asian admixture in
pre-Austronesian Leang Panninge suggests that the Austronesians were not
the first to venture into the Oceanic deep East. This is also hinted by
the presence of the Onge-like ancestry in South America that likely
reached there directly by sea via the Pacific coast. However,
Austronesians certainly seem to have been the most successful. This
raises the question of whether their boats were the critical factor that
allowed the Papuan-like people to reach Vanuatu after the Austronesians
got there first. This might also explain why the Austronesian language
rather than genetics dominated in Vanuatu by functioning as the link
language between the islands. Finally, this brings us to the recent work
that has provided evidence for South American admixture from a Zenu-like
South American tribe among the Polynesians, supporting the much-maligned
contention of Thor Heyerdahl. Here again, it is peculiar that there is
no evidence for a greater South American presence in Polynesia if they
managed to reach some of the islands and transmit the sweet potato
(Ipomea batatas). We suspect the initiative was with the maritime
Polynesians who managed to reach the South American coast and bring back
some admixture to their islands along with the sweet potato. Perhaps, as
Heyerdahl speculated, this contact might have also contributed to some
of the iconographic convergences that he noted, like on Easter Island.

Clear monophyletic language families like Austroasiatic and Austronesian
are not seen as uniting China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan, though
these East Asians are genetically very close. While Japonic and Koreanic
have structural similarities, evidence for their monophyly as sister
groups or as part of a larger Macro-Altaic assemblage is limited. This
suggests that the Yayoi probably brought the Japonic languages to Japan.
This might explain the more general structural similarities with North
East Asian language families like Koreanic and Tungusic but the absence
of a specific relationship. The Kofun, while contributing most of the
genetics of the extant Japanese, did not bring the language itself. They
instead probably rose up in the Yayoi background as an elite that
adopted the Yayoi language while spreading Kofun genetics.

Thus, ancient DNA is making up for the absence of recorded history.
Unfortunately, this revolution has not yet touched India. Imagine if we
were to know something of Jorwe culture or Ash Mound peoples — they
remain archaeological black boxes along with several other slices of
Indian history.

Readers of these pages will know that we have a special interest in the
geometry of
[ovals](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/a-biographical-journey-from-conics-to-ovals/).
One of the long-standing problems in this regard is: what is the curve
that best describes the shape of a dinosaurian egg? While all
archosauromorphs hatch from eggs outside their mother’s body, the form
of their eggs is rather variable; crocodylians and turtles may lay
either leathery or hard-shelled eggs. The dinosaurs almost always lay
hard-shelled eggs that tend to be rather uniform in shape in the wild.
Being hard-shelled, the shape of a dinosaurian egg can be described by
the characteristic curve of its maximal (area) cross-section. The egg
itself will be the solid of rotation of this curve around its longest
axis. Using this definition, the noted morphometrician and student of
Aristotelian zoology, D’arcy Thompson, classified bird eggs into various
forms in his famous book “On growth and form”. More recently, this was
revisited by Nishiyama, who named 4 shape groups for the eggs of modern
(avian) dinosaurs: (1) circular; (2) elliptical; (3) oval; and (4)
pyriform. However, an examination of a large data set of eggs from
around 1400 extant birds by Mahadevan and colleagues shows no strict
boundaries between the shape classes. Hence, in principle, they should
all be describable by a single equation of shape with varying
parameters. If postmortem distortion and the effects of fossilization
have been properly accounted for, the Mesozoic dinosaur eggs featured
additional diversity. For example, the eggs of theropods, like the
tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus, would not be described appropriately by any of
the 4 purported classes. It would rather be a generalized higher-order
elliptical egg (see below). Hence, ideally, the equation should not just
cover extant dinosaurs but also the extinct ones.

Indeed, there has been a long-standing interest in obtaining that single
equation that describes eggs’ shapes, starting with extant birds. One
such early attempt was that of the Swiss geometer Jakob Steiner who
proposed the oval of Descartes (defined by the bipolar equation:
![r+mr'=c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%2Bmr%27%3Dc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the ratio parameter and
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the constant sum) as the general equation for avian eggs. However,
D’arcy Thomas had pointed out that various avian eggs do not fit this
curve. Subsequent explorations of this question have offered a range of
solutions. In light of recent work presenting a new potential solution,
we consider and compare some notable attempts, including the latest.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Maxwellian ovals: The great JC Maxwell, while still in his early teens,
generalized the ellipses to describe families of ovals. Of these, one
class of ovals, the “trifocal ellipse” can be described using three
functions in ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![f_1(x,y)=x^2+y^2; f_2(x,y)=(x-a)^2+y^2;
f_3(x,y)=(x-b)^2+y^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%28x%2Cy%29%3Dx%5E2%2By%5E2%3B+f_2%28x%2Cy%29%3D%28x-a%29%5E2%2By%5E2%3B+f_3%28x%2Cy%29%3D%28x-b%29%5E2%2By%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Then the Maxwellian oval is described by the equation:

![\\sqrt{f_1(x,y)}+\\sqrt{f_2(x,y)}+\\sqrt{f_3(x,y)}=c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bf_1%28x%2Cy%29%7D%2B%5Csqrt%7Bf_2%28x%2Cy%29%7D%2B%5Csqrt%7Bf_3%28x%2Cy%29%7D%3Dc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are parameters.

Figure 1. A Maxwellian trifocal oval.

We too independently arrived at this curve in our teens but, unlike
Maxwell, did not achieve any deep understanding of the physics of these
curves. This curve is constructed using the same principle as an
ellipse, viz., the locus of points whose distances from the foci add up
to a constant, but it has 3 colinear foci instead of 2 of the regular
ellipse (Figure 1). For ![a=1, b=0.2,
c=2.2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%2C+b%3D0.2%2C+c%3D2.2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and close values, we get a curve that even a casual observer will note
as approximating the shape of common avian eggs (Figure 1). Indeed, in
1957, such a curve had been used by a certain E. Ehrhart as a possible
fit for the avian egg following statistical analysis of real specimens.
Unaware of Ehrhart’s work, in course of our own early experiments with
this curve, we too considered this as a possible description of the
shape of the most common type of avian egg prototyped by those of
several galloanseran birds. This has now been borne out by the large
dataset of Mahadevan and coworkers, in which the most frequently
occurring morphology is close to this curve. However, it is hardly a
universal equation of shape as there are several egg shapes lying
outside its scope.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Hügelschäffer’s equation: The the 1940s, a German engineer Fritz
Hügelschäffer, derived the equation of an oval that he felt was a good
fit for the shape of avian eggs. As we have noted before on these pages,
we independently arrived at the [construction of this
oval](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/a-biographical-journey-from-conics-to-ovals/)
and derived its equation while in junior college. Hügelschäffer
expressed the equation of this curve in the following form:

![y=\\pm\\dfrac{B}{2}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{L^{2}-4x^{2}}{L^{2}+8wx+4w^{2}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm%5Cdfrac%7BB%7D%7B2%7D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7BL%5E%7B2%7D-4x%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7BL%5E%7B2%7D%2B8wx%2B4w%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here,
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the major axis or length of the egg with its center placed at origin
![O=(0,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%3D%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the minor axis or maximal breadth of the egg.
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the distance between
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the point of intersection of the segments
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By taking
![L=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
this effectively yields a 2 parameter ![(B,
w)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28B%2C+w%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
shape curve, that accounts for more egg morphologies than the Maxwellian

![L=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we obtain the circular ![(B=1;

shape classes of extant avian eggs. Moreover, its parameters are
entirely intuitive and can be measured easily from real specimens.
However, it does not account for the so-called pyriform class (common in
shorebirds) or the Mesozoic dinosaurian eggs like those of Tarbosaurus,
the caenagnathid Beibeilong, the troodontids, or the ceratopsian
Protoceratops.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Preston’s 4 parameter oval: Incited by D’arcy Thompson’s failure to give
a general equation for the shape of eggs, in the 1950s, Frank Preston,
a versatile English engineer (invented a glass-melting furnace and a
device to measure avian egg shapes), marksman and naturalist, derived
the 4 parameter oval to describe the shape of all bird eggs. He used the
following logic: the most symmetric class is the circular class for
which one can easily write down the equation: ![y=\\pm
\\sqrt{1-x^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B1-x%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By multiplying this by the parameter ![a \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the aspect ratio (ratio of minor to major axis) of an ellipse, we get
the equation ![y= \\pm
a\\sqrt{1-x^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Cpm+a%5Csqrt%7B1-x%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which can account for both the circular and elliptical classes. Then
Preston accounted for the remaining classes using a polynomial function
![f(x)=1+bx+cx^2+dx^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D1%2Bbx%2Bcx%5E2%2Bdx%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![-1 \\le b, c, d \\le

thus yielding the final equation of a generalized oval:

![y=\\pm
a(1+bx+cx^2+dx^3)\\sqrt{1-x^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+a%281%2Bbx%2Bcx%5E2%2Bdx%5E3%29%5Csqrt%7B1-x%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

As one can see from Figure 2, Preston’s 4 parameter oval accounts for
all dinosaur egg shapes extant and extinct. The egg of the Ural owl is
of the elliptical class coming close to the circular class. The emu is
nearly a classical elliptical with a very small
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
parameter that adjusts it to a more generalized ellipse. The song thrush
and osprey are very nearly ovals with a pronounced
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
parameter and slight adjustments, again with a very small
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
parameter. The guillemot and great snipe are clear pyriforms with both
pronounced
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
parameters. The extinct dinosaur Troodon has an egg quite distinct from
any extant bird but can still be modeled by Preston’s oval with positive
![c,
d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2C+d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
terms. The egg of Tarbosaurs (and others like it, e.g., Beibeilong or
Protoceratops) is a generalized ellipse that is again well-modeled by
Preston’s equation with just a negative
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
term with other
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
powers in the polynomial having 0 coefficients. Preston’s equation can
model most extant bird eggs using just the linear and square terms with
negative coefficients. The cubic term is only needed for unusual eggs,
like in this case, that of Troodon. Since Preston, several researchers
have tried to duplicate his approach by using other functions in place
of his cubic polynomial (see below). However, recent numerical analysis
using a dataset of 132 real eggs from various modern species by Biggins
et al. has shown that Preston’s curve outperforms all these other
attempts in having the least and an impressively small error. Thus, the
Preston 4 parameter oval can be considered a valid, universal
description of the shape of the dinosaurian egg.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
In light of the success of the Preston oval, we were a bit surprised
when we saw a recent work by Narushin et al. claiming to introduce a
universal formula for the egg shape. They acknowledge the success of
Preston’s work but state that the parameters in his equation are neither
intuitive nor readily determined. The former is indeed a potential
criticism; however, the latter is less of any issue with modern graphing
software, so long as one has good photographs. Hence, they decided to
start with Hügelschäffer’s formula and applied a series of modifications
to arrive at a complicated formula for a general oval:

![y= \\dfrac{B}{2}\\sqrt{ \\dfrac{L^{2}-4x^{2}}{L^{2}+8wx+4w^{2}}} (1- k
f(x))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Cdfrac%7BB%7D%7B2%7D%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cdfrac%7BL%5E%7B2%7D-4x%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7BL%5E%7B2%7D%2B8wx%2B4w%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7D+%281-+k+f%28x%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here, as in Hügelschäffer’s equation,
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the major axis or length of the egg;
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is its minor axis or greatest breadth;
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the breadth of the egg at the point halfway from the center at
![(0,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the narrow end of the egg (Figure 3). However,
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is not the same as in the Hügelschäffer equation but is defined as:

![w=\\dfrac{L-B}{2n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D%5Cdfrac%7BL-B%7D%7B2n%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a positive number.

landmarks of Narushin et al’s equation for a dinosaurian egg.

One advantage of this equation is that ![L, B,
D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%2C+B%2C+D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be directly measured relatively simply with Vernier’s calipers and a
ruler. The
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
parameter can be empirically calculated from ![L,
B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%2C+B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by adjusting
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
While the authors state this equation can account for all extant bird
eggs, we found that, unlike Preston’s equation, it could not account for
special cases of extinct dinosaur eggs, like those of Troodon and
Tarbosaurus, assuming that their reconstruction is accurate. However, we
rectified that by using an “inversion” flag that takes 3 values: N, Y,
and H. It appears that for all extant birds (at least those considered
by Narushin et al.), this flag is N; these can be modeled using their
equation as is. For Troodon and related eggs, the flag is Y; here,
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has to be substituted by
![-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For Tarbosaurus and related eggs, the flag is H; here for
![-\\tfrac{L}{2}\\le x \\le
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Ctfrac%7BL%7D%7B2%7D%5Cle+x+%5Cle+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we use the equation as is and for ![0 \< x \\le
\\tfrac{L}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%3C+x+%5Cle+%5Ctfrac%7BL%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we substitute
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with
![-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This accounts for all dinosaur egg shapes comparable to Preston’s
equation (Figure 4). If we normalize it by taking
![L=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
it effectively leaves us with a maximum of 4 parameters as in the case
of Preston’s equation.

The relative merits of this equation need to be compared to that of
Preston’s using real specimens. Unfortunately, this requires additional
work as Mahadevan and colleagues’ large dataset does not have all the
necessary measurements for such a comparison. They instead used the oval
of Baker, an attempt to duplicate Preston’s work, which significantly
falls short of the latter in terms of accuracy while providing a simple
2 parameter space. It is defined by the equation:

![y=\\pm
a\\left(1-x\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1+b}}\\left(1+x\\right)^{\\frac{b}{1+b}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+a%5Cleft%281-x%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Bb%7D%7D%5Cleft%281%2Bx%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7B1%2Bb%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here ![0 \\le a \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+a+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the aspect ratio of the ellipse as in Preston’s equation or the
equivalent of ![B \|
L=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%7C+L%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Hügelschäffer’s equation, while ![1 \\le b \\le
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+b+%5Cle+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is an asymmetry parameter similar to
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Hügelschäffer’s equation. This curve has 3 successively tangent lobes
with points of tangency at
![(-1,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![(1,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For ![x \\le

and ![x \\ge
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cge+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the two lobes have a divergent hyperbola-like form. For ![-1 \\le x \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1+%5Cle+x+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the curve takes the form of the oval that approximates the shape of a
dinosaurian egg. When
![b=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the curve becomes an ellipse.

A biologist can easily conceive each of the parameters from Preston’s or
Narushin et al.’s curves as being controlled by a genetic factor, with
changes in it leading to a change in the parameter. Thus, one can easily
account for the diversity of egg morphologies observed among dinosaurs
through genetic changes. The parameter
![\\leftrightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleftrightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gene mapping feeds directly into the question of what are the selective
forces acting on egg shape. Several of these have been proposed and
debated since Darwin. Irrespective of the correctness of some of these,
one key point emerging from the suggestions made by Birkhead is that the
ovoid morphology is a clear sign of a comprise solution resulting from
balancing selection. The compromises themselves might involve very
different factors. One such relates to spherical morphology having the
smallest surface area for a given volume. Hence, it is ideal for not
losing heat quickly. However, eggs also need to be externally warmed,
either by direct contact with the mother or exposure to solar or
geothermal heat (e.g., in titanosaurs). Here, a less spherical shape
would afford a greater surface area to allow quicker external heating.
Similarly, a hard-shelled egg would have the greatest strength against
external force if spherical. This would be selected for better
protection or bearing the weight of the brooding mother or insulating
material deposited atop it. On the other hand, it should also be easy
enough for the chick to break out. These opposing forces would lead to
compromise solutions in the form of deviations from circularity.
Mahadevan and colleagues also observed that increased flight performance
is often associated with smaller aspect ratios and more asymmetric eggs.
Here again, a compromise of sorts might be in play — higher flight
performance selects for bigger eggs on one hand and a more streamlined
body on the other. Hence, the compromise is achieved by having longer or
more asymmetric eggs. A similar effect, albeit unrelated to flight, but
body morphology, might have also been at play in the Mesozoic dinosaurs
with long eggs. Of course, the shape diversity beyond a simple ellipse
suggests that other selective forces beyond the above are also at play.

However, a morphometrician of the bent of D’arcy Thompson would still
object that these equations need to be derived ground up from physics —
in fact, he voices precisely that problem in his account of bird egg
shapes — they need to be derived from an equation which accounts for
fluid pressure in a bounded membrane. This was keeping with his wider
skepticism towards one of the foundations of biology (natural selection)
while emphasizing the other (geometry). Mahadevan and colleagues
presented such a derivation a few years back; however, it is not clear
if it can actually recapitulate the entire range of ovals seen in
real-life dinosaurian eggs.

Sharvamanyu was with his preceptors Somakhya on Lootika on the shore of
a lake in the midst of the mountains on a full moon night. It was the
cremation ground for a lineage of
V_4s,
who had historically specialized in the arts of preparing
medico-recreational substances from Acacias but had risen to the status
of warriors during the great Jihād-s of the monstrous Mogol tyrants.
Some distance from where they sat, the shore was whitened by the bones
of the generations of
V_4s
who taken the ladder to confront the glowing jaws of the fearsome
Sārameyau en route to the realm of Vivasvān’s dark son. Now, those
osseous remains gleamed like gold as the bowl of soma climbed over the
lake to gladden the bands of Vasu-s, Āditya-s and Rudra-s with a
pleasing draught. Mātariśvan, who is also known as Śambhu, drafted a
pleasant breeze over the lake making waves lap the banks, even as the
music of the sons of Rudra playing on the vāṇa-s sounded in the airy
realm. Sharvamanyu sought the mysterious experience of yoga from his
preceptors. He had been practicing a mantra for six months but had met
with nothing but failure. The ensign of Soma climbing the celestial
vault occulted the great mass of stars known as Tiṣyā, marking the day
of the great bull-sacrifice of yore to Rudra. That conjunction is indeed
a sign of the gods Somārudrā — the Taittirīya-śruti has declared: “rudro
vai tiṣyaḥ \|”. Somakhya and Lootika had verily received a signal of The
god in that regard. It is said that on that day the dānava Maya had
built the Tripura-s, and it was on that day that Rudra had destroyed the
triple-planets.

They led Sharvamanyu to a small shrine of the awful Vināyaka by the
cemetery with an archaic image of the god. An inscription from the
Vikrama year 1532 stated that the image had been found in the lake by a
Gāṇapatya siddha and installed in the shrine. The siddha was said to
have joined the retinue of his chosen god as a phantom upon his death
and was believed to manifest occasionally in those regions, especially
to
V_4
votaries who were uncorrupted by religious degeneration that had passed
through the region thereafter. Somakhya and his wife asked Sharvamanyu
to worship Vighna with a short stuti and by placing some of the flowers
they had collected in course of their trek to the lake at the feet of
the image. Sharvamanyu recalled one their teacher Shilpika had taught
them:  
namas te gajavatrāya namas te gaṇanāyaka \|  
vināyaka namas te .astu namaste caṇḍavikrama \|\|  
Obeisance to you, the elephant-faced, obeisance to you the lord of the
hosts; obeisance be to you the Vināyaka; obeisance to you of fierce
valor.

namo .astu te vighnakarte namas te sarpamekhala \|  
namas te rudravaktrottha-pralamba-jaṭharāśrita \|\|  
Obeisance be to you the creator of obstacles, obeisance to you with a
snake-girdle; obeisance to you endowed with a pendant belly, who emerged
from Rudra’s face.

Then, they asked Sharvamanyu to do the kara- and aṅga-nyāsa-s
appropriately and begin the japa of his mantra 324 times. As he was in
the midst of that, Lootika pointed her siddha-kāṣṭha, whose tip bore the
carving of the head of Garuḍa, at him. Suddenly, he had a vision of a
huddled band of people wearing bone-ornaments singing songs in a strange
language. He could catch many words, but it was not entirely
intelligible to him — it was neither Sanskrit nor a modern Aprabhraṃśa.
At climactic phrases in the lyrics, he felt overpowering emotions
seizing him from deep within. From the midst of the band arose the ghost
of a
V_1
named Kiñjalka. The phantom said: “Having performed great acts of valor,
I was beset by a large band of well-armed enemies when my siddhi-s had
declined. Hence, I had to do battle as an ordinary man though I was
still powered by all the experience I had acquired from my assiduous
practice from a young age. Thus, fighting my foes like the sūtaputra in
his last fight, I was slain and passed into the retinue of Paśupati
Deva.” Then, he saw the apparition of a beautiful woman. As she faded
away from his vision, he felt all his strength had ebbed away, and he
involuntarily fell to the ground. As he struggled to get up, he saw a
dog repeatedly going to the cemetery and waiting for someone who had
joined the Pitṛrāṭ. As the apparition of the dog rose up into the sky
and merged with the constellation graced by the bright Procyon, he saw a
cat descending from a pole and run towards a large bowl with a goldfish.
It knocked down the bowl, and the fish jumped out to swim away into the
great lake stretching before him clearing the prior apparitions. Then,
despite the moon being there in the sky, all went pitch black — he felt
he was in a subterranean cave with no lamp. That utter darkness remained
for some time during which he lost track of everything except the mantra
whose japa he was performing. He then saw his friend Vidrum being
dragged away with a lasso around his neck by a buffalo. He wanted to
shout out to his companions to aid his friend, but his voice deserted
him. Now, to his utter horror, he saw Abhirosha’s corpse being eaten by
a voracious dog and crows. Then, he saw himself being dragged the same
way but now he felt an utter calm — death no longer seemed to cause him
any concern at all and all his emotions were stilled.

Then, he saw a great procession of reptiles and other strange animals,
of which he recognized only a few, but the rest still seemed vaguely
familiar to him as he had seen Somakhya and Lootika draw them when they
were in school. In that utter darkness, he saw a clear vision of the
temple of Rudra in the cemetery with the liṅga blazing forth as though
self-luminescent — he remembered his teachers telling of the term
sadyojyotis — now he realized what that meant. He heard the mantra-s
from the Taittirīya-śruti by which the liṅga is installed. Suddenly, the
terrifying five-headed god after whom his parents had named him
manifested from the liṅga. Each of the brahma-mantra-s from the upaniṣat
of the Taittirīyaka-s, revealing the five-fold form of the god known as
Mahādeva, sequentially manifested in his mind. The first was that of
Sadyojāta with which he saw the face of Kumāra. The next was that of
Vāmadeva with which he saw the perfect face of Manonmanī. Then the
Aghora mantra manifested, and he saw the dreaded face of the Bhairava.
After that came the Tatpuruṣa mantra, and he beheld an aquiline face
with a solar orb, glowing like the eagle of the god Savitṛ. Finally,
came the Iśāna mantra, and he saw that glorious face known as
Rudra-sadāśiva. The apparition of Rudra was more real than any
experience he had had. His mind involuntarily remarked over the japa:
“He is known as Paśupati; he is Īśāna.”

Thereafter, he could discern the great bow of the god and the missile
mentioned in the scriptures as the Pāśupata — the great arrow of
Nīlarudra. He then saw the terrifying trident of the god with which he
had impaled Andhaka in the vast White Forest; the cakra with which he
had severed the head of Jalandhara who had even bound the Vaḍavānala;
the Aghora-missile with which he had destroyed the triple-forts; the
vajra praised in the śruti; the bhindipāla, the śataghni, the tomara,
the prāsa and the terrifying sword with which had dealt death to
numerous dānava-s as described in the national epic. He was accompanied
by an awful troop of gaṇeśvara-s, the ape-faced Nandin, the skeletal
Bhṛṅgin, the many-armed lion-headed Vīrabhadra who had beheaded Dakṣa
and flayed the giant daitya Nala, the black Mahākāla, the Kṣetrapāla
emitting a meteor that blazed through the firmament and Caṇḍeśa. He also
saw Kīrtimukha, of the form of a standalone leonine head, and the
Śiva-kṛtyā, who had emerged from the mouth of Rudra to snare the
Bhārgava in her vulva, both inspiring a primal fear. He saw a great
churn of rapidly moving Pramatha-s holding tridents, axes, and other
weapons looking like smaller Rudra-s. Then he saw the Śiva-gaṇa-s with
lion-, elephant-, horse-, donkey-, dolphin-, hog-, bovine-, goat- and
ram- faces prancing along, brandishing various weapons. He also saw the
axe-wielding Gaṇapa surrounded by a great host of ferocious, black
elephant-headed Vināyaka-s. For a moment, the realization of the
profound gaṇa-vidyā, illuminating the meaning of the multitude of gaṇa-s
of Mahādeva flashed in him. He simultaneously saw the import of Rudra in
the śruti and the śaiva-śāstra. At that point, he beheld the skull of
Prajāpati held by Rudra. At once, he had the realization that he,
together with the entire universe, was within that skull gracing the
eight-fold god. He spontaneously uttered that Atharvan incantation of
The god, manifesting both as himself and his son, believed to have been
said by Prajāpati himself as he was decapitated by Rudra:  
kāpālin rudra babhro .atha bhava kairāta suvrata \|  
pāhi viśvaṃ viśālākṣa kumāra varavikrama \|\|

Thereafter, he spontaneously uttered the devadeveśvara-stuti:  
namo viṣama-netrāya namas te tryambakāya ca \|  
namaḥ sahasra-netrāya namas te śūla-pāṇine \|  
namaḥ khaṭvāṅga-hastāya namas te daṇḍa-dhāriṇe \|\|  
Obeisance to the odd-eyed one and obeisance to you with the three
goddesses. Obeisance to the thousand-eyed, obeisance to you with a
trident in hand. Obeisance to the one with the skull-topped brand in
hand, obeisance to you bearing the cudgel.

tvaṃ deva hutabhug-jvālā-koṭi-bhānu-samaprabhaḥ \|  
adarśane vayaṃ deva mūḍha-vijñānato .adhunā \|\|

foolish; now we have been enlightened.

O one how blew up Bhaga’s eyes, of skilled actions, may you take the
foremost offering of the ritual. O lord of the gods, the blue-throated
one be pleased. Protect us, o one endowed with all qualities.

O god of unattainable form smeared with white ashes, the skull-bearer,

the lotus-stalk (as Agni or from Prajāpati) protect us from all fears.

O eternal lord of the gods, the root of all lineages of the universe, I
see in your body the excellent Veda-s together with the Vedāṅga-s, the
various branches of knowledge, and the Pada and Krama recitations of the
Veda, everything is inside you, o god of the gods.

O Bhava, Śarva, Mahādeva, the yielder of the Pināka, Rudra, Hara. We all
bow to you, o lord of the universe. Protect us, o foremost lord.

Thereafter, Sharvamanyu saw in place of Rudra, his consort, the great
goddess Kālarātrī, surrounded by diverse yoginī-s filling the whole
field of view up to the horizon with an eight-fold symmetry. At that
sight, he spontaneously uttered the Kalarātrī-stuti:  
jayasva devi cāmuṇḍe jaya bhūtāpahāriṇi \|  
jaya sarvagate devi kālarātre namo .astu te \|\|  
Victory be to you the goddess Cāmuṇḍā; victory to you who snatches away

O Cāmuṇḍā, with a flaming mouth, with sharp fangs, you of great might,

one.

Obeisance be to you, o terrible-eyed one, frightful goddess, striking
terror in all beings, terrifying one, formidable one, the great time
goddess and the terrifying one. She is time, the terrible one, striding
boldly and the night of dissolution.

Sharvamanyu concluded his japa and rose, wanting to ask his companions
about his visions, but they pressed their fingers to their lips,
directing him to be quiet and continue the japa as they climbed one of
the proximal hills on the rim of the lake. As they made their way up,
they paused to take yet another look at the great occultation of Tiṣya
nearing its conclusion. Reaching the top of the prominence, they arrived
at the little shrine of Śiva. On the wall of the shrine was the relief
of a siddhayoṣit Stṛkā performing liṅgārcana. Somakhya and Lootika
offered some flowers there and performed a tarpaṇa to the feet of the
said siddhayoṣit. They asked Sharvamanyu to do the same and remarked:
“This siddhayoṣit, Stṛkā, impelled by Mahādeva arrived from the
continent of Śvetadvīpa to become a student of the charismatic
siddhayoṣit Indramaṇidevī of the śūdra-varṇa at Śūrpāraka. There having
studied the Śambhu-para scriptures and observing the vrata of chastity,
she acquired siddhi-s in various Māheśvara-mantra-s. Then, she performed
mantra-sādhanā at the cemeteries of Kollagiri, Kilakilārava, where the
yadu hero had slain the giant ape Dvividha, and Avimukta, where
Kālabhairava had imparted the kāpālika rite to Kubera. She then settled
here under the patronage of the lord Jayakeśin. Due to her siddhi-s in
the Netra, Koṭarākṣa, Vyādibhakṣa and Aghoreśvarī vidyā-s, she lived a
long life free of trouble teaching the Māheśvara-śāstra-s and
experiencing the glories of Nīlarudra.”

Then seating themselves on the platform around the shrine Somakhya and
Lootika bade Sharvamanyu to ask them questions that he might have
regarding his sādhanā. Sh: “The experience I had finally opened me to
the possibility of what the lakṣya of the sādhāna might be. I had
struggled for months failing with the dhyāna and, after that, with the
avadhāna. But the sudden manifestation of a clear vision of the deva and
his parivāra has cleared that issue in one stroke.”

L: “Indeed, succeeding at dhyāna is an impediment for many. A small
number of people are endowed with sahaja-dhyāna capacity — the same is
true for the other steps in sādhanā. Such folks might wonder why others
should even raise the matter. Let me be clear, devatā-dhyāna does not
come automatically to the majority. However, it can be achieved by
multiple means: (i) through the repeated study of mantra-siddhānta-s
that give accounts of the devatā-s; (ii) through purāṇa readings; (iii)
through study of properly prepared texts known as
devatā-citra-saṃgraha-s; (iv) by visits to temples or attending temple
festivals or cala-pujā-s to behold the icons of the deities; (v) by an
experience induced by teachers or other interested mantravādin-s. We
attempted that last option with you, and believe it should help you
going forward.”

Sh: “Still, I wonder if ī might succeed at the avadhāna and if the
siddhi might manifest at all? Pray tell me what are the rahasya-s of
that?”  
S: “Abhyāsa is the first and foremost step. As with physical exercise,
for most people, the ability to perform something at a certain level
does not come as sahaja. They have to use their will often with enormous
force to get themselves to practice. At first, the going is hard, the
fruits are limited, and there could even be negatives like pain. One has
to calibrate the right level the body can take and slowly step up the
gradient — you know this well in physical practice. Eventually, one
starts seeing the benefits of it and liking the action. Unfortunately,
the path to even a modicum of siddhi is littered with sādhaka-s who
failed at this step. That is the reason many of our traditions emphasize
physical yoga with āsana, prāṇāyāma, and the like. It gives you a
tangible object of control — your own body. By observing how you
succeeded in that control, you will develop a model that can be imitated
at the mental level to acquire the control needed for avadhāna. Lootika,
do you want to add something?”

L: “Regarding siddhi, I would remark that svayaṃsiddha-s are rare. The
siddhayoṣit, at whose shrine we are now seated, is a case in point.
However, she became one due to two points that are often overlooked.
First, she had sahaja capacity for abhyāsa — without that, she could not
have become a svayaṃsiddha. Second, she was an example of a daivarakṣitā
— otherwise, how could she have come safely from Śvetadvīpa to
Jambudvīpa — she could have been captured and borne away by any number
of men in the process. Then, she managed to perform kṣetrāṭana, reaching
difficult śmaśāna-s to perform sādhanā. Hence, one has to be cognizant
of one’s condition. The probability of being daivrakṣita is low; one
cannot make that a default assumption; likewise with
sahajābhāyasa-śakti. Hence, one has to gauge one’s capacity while not
faltering at the abhyāsa and set the sādhya accordingly.”

Sh: “Surely the apparition of the phantom of Kiñjalka and the dog that
kept visiting the cemetery have a lesson here?”  
L: “The case of said
V_1
gives an important lesson. A human is a finite being with a relatively
small window of opportunity. A person usually begins life with no
special endowments. Even a sahaja soul, while endowed with great
potential, cannot make that manifest entirely without appropriate
abhyāsa. Then he reaches a high point upon honing his sahaja capacity by
abhyāsa at some point in his youth. After that, he plateaus. This is
because he comes under two opposing forces, one of physical decline with
age and the other of the growing wisdom and experience fueled by his
constant sādhana. At some point, his physical decline overshoots his
accruing wisdom and ability; thus, his downward slide begins. In some
sādhaka-s, the fame of their sādhana attracts pupils from the ranks of
others seeking glory. They seek para-saṃyogāt mahattvam, which in turn
feeds into the sādhaka, for he is now possessed of an army of pupils. As
we have told you before, vidyā is enhanced by the resonance with good
antevāsin-s. Thus, he may rightly (due to wise counseling of his army)
or wrongly (living off the deeds of his students) be buoyed up much
longer than his true personal capacity. In the case of Kiñjalka, he was
unable to get a troop of any size and had to live off his own capacity.
Hence, when confronted by a bhrātṛvya with a larger force, he was killed
with his own capacity limited by physical decline. Thus, the lesson is
one may experience a plateau in the sādhanā, after which the decline and
death follow. Thus, many sādhaka-s have come and gone, and nobody
remembers them. Other things can happen. Either when human decline sets
in, or when a sādhaka has had an experience like you had today, or when
he witnessed the siddhi of his guru from close quarters, he might think
that the siddhi is close by and will repeatedly try to grasp it.
However, it would be as futile as the dog hoping day after day that its
master who has taken the southern path would return from the cemetery.”

Sh: “Somakhya, I note that you are in silent contemplation with almost a
tinge of disapproval. Have I done something wrong?”  
S: “You know me from so long back that you picked something just from my
face that you felt was disapproval. It is not — it is just that I was
mentally wanting to head off certain questions that I felt would ensue
from you. As for the rest of the apparitions in your experience, spend
some days contemplating them in silence, and you will get your answers.
You may ask other questions, though.”  
Sh: “I now realize that the path can be the climb up the slopes of
Kailāsa — some go up to glimpse the god and return to the world of men,
but others make an exit midway to join the retinue of the god as a
phantom! But in everyday life, man continues with his toils if he sees
at least a few positive results else, he gives up. How does one keep
toiling in face of repeated failure, when one might be reaching for the
unattainable like the dog at the cemetery? Moreover, [the tale of the
wicks of
Bhairavānanda](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/07/17/bhairavanandas-wicks-a-retelling/),
which Lootika had told us in school, comes to mind — would I end up with
wheel on my head for my persistence?”

S: “That is indeed the hardest part. You may have the great svayaṃsiddhi
but not be daivarakṣita. Thus, your attainments could be modest.
However, due to your svayaṃsiddhi you might have perfect jñāna of what
it would be like to be mahāsiddha but still not be one in reality. If
you have that jñāna, you may keep trying, though, in the end, your fate
would be no different from that of the dog. It might be frustrating, but
at least you would have only failed from being a daivahataka. But then
take the case of our former classmate Hemaliṅga; he definitely had
enormous mathematical capacity and smashed his way to a certain level.
But he sought to reach the levels of the great gaṇitajña-s of all times
that lay out of his reach. Attempting hard, like trying to leap onto a
high ledge, he only hit the cliff-face and dropped down. However, that
was not fatal; Vrishcika tells us that his abhyāsa at least [brought him
comfort in
life](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lutika-somakhyo%e1%b8%a5-pravada%e1%b8%a5/).
Thus, the great failed attempt at mahāsiddhi often builds character and
gives you a minor siddhi that might bring pleasure in life. However, we
must warn you Sharva, that path to the highest siddhi-s is fraught with
much danger even as the fourth wick of Bhairavānanda. You might see
warnings as you are headed that way, which you must differentiate from
benign failures. Indeed, Lootika and I have seen the ghost of more than
one
V_1,
who persisted through those warnings and fell in such attempts, like the
corpses of forgotten climbers on slopes of the Himavant. On the other
side, if your sādhya has come in clear vision, keep toiling and change
upāya-s upon repeatedly failing. Like in biology, so also here;
remember, once one has entered the stream, one sinks when the toil
ceases. So you have to do so just to stay afloat. The good teacher
should tell those who cannot keep up to exit early.”  
Lootika: “Now, let us resume our trek back to reach in time to catch the
train back to the city.”

This note originated as an intended appendix to the [article on Rudra
and the
Aśvin-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/the-asvin-s-and-rudra/)
we published earlier. The first offshoot from that work, which we
published separately, explored the links between [Rudra, Viṣṇu and the
Aśvin-s in the śrauta
ritual](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/05/25/vi%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87u-the-marut-s-and-rudra/).
We finally found the time to fully write down the intended appendix and
present it as a separate note. To rehash, we noted an intimate
connection between the primary Rudra-class deity (typically in his
manifestation as the great heavenly Asura, the father of the worlds) and
the twin deities (the Aśvin-class) of the ancestral Indo-European
religion. This is preserved in multiple descendants of our ancestral
religion, such as in the śruti, the para-Vedic material in the
aitihāsika-paurāṇika corpus, in the Roman religion relating to Castor
and Pollux, and probably the non-Zoroastrian strains of the Iranian
religion. It was definitely there in at least some branches of the
Germanic religion, but its destruction by the West Asian mental disease
has only left us with the euhemeristic figment of Horsa and Hengist as
the descendants of Woden. Likewise, we hear explicitly of the
destruction by the Christians of the temple dedicated to the Western
Slavic deity Rugiaevit and his twin sons Porevit and Porenut. It is
pretty likely that Rugiaevit’s name is derived from the same root ru- as
that in the name of Rudra, and these twin sons are the equivalents of
the Aśvin-s.

In the śruti, this old motif manifests as the Aśvin-s being the sons of
Rudra who follow on his track as he rides his heavenly chariot. As the
physicians of the gods, they inherit the medical and pharmacological
virtuosity of their father. In a parallel Vaidika tradition, which
entered the śruti fold from a group of Aryans distinct from the ṛṣi-s
who composed the RV, the twin sons of Rudra are [Bhava and
Śarva](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/the-asvin-s-and-rudra/),
who accompany their father, like the Dioskouroi of the Greco-Roman
worlds. Their worship is prominent in the Atharvaveda and some texts
preserved in later Vedic collections; however, in the ādhvaryava
tradition, they were absorbed as names of Rudra or those of the
multitude of Rudra-s. In the para-Vedic material preserved in the
itihāsa-s and purāṇa-s we see them as the twin ectype of Skanda, i.e.,
as Skanda-Viśākhau, the sons of Rudra.

With this background, we shall consider the enigmatic sūkta of Urucakri
Ātreya (RV 5.70), which on the surface is a simple 4-ṛk one in the
Gāyatrī meter. The anukramaṇi specifies its deities at the twin
Āditya-s, Mitra and Varuṇa. Indeed, the first ṛk of the sūkta is
directed to these gods and it is embedded amid the long series of
sūkta-s to Mitra and Varuṇa by different Ātreya-s:  
purūruṇā cid dhy asty avo nūnaṃ vāṃ varuṇa । mitra vaṃsi vāṃ sumatim ॥  
Indeed, now, in full breadth is the aid from you two, O Varuṇa! I have
gained the benevolence of you two, O Mitra!

After beginning with an acknowledgment of the help gained from Mitra and
Varuṇa, the next ṛk suddenly changes the focal deities:

tā vāṃ samyag adruhvāṇeṣam aśyāma dhāyase । vayaṃ te rudrā syāma ॥  
O you two, may we attain you two together, in your benign state
(literally: without intention to harm) for our stability. May we be so,
o you two Rudra-s.

pātaṃ no rudrā pāyubhir uta trāyethāṃ sutrātrā । turyāma dasyūn tanūbhiḥ
॥  
Protect us, two Rudra-s, by your defenses; also save us, since you two
are good rescuers. May we overpower the dasyu-s with our bodies.

Notably, the deities remain dual in the above two ṛk-s, but they are
explicitly identified as twin Rudra-s. While some students of the Veda
have taken this use of Rudra to be merely an appellation transferred to
the deities of the first ṛk, there is no support for that. Mitra and
Varuṇa are unanimously categorized in the Āditya class, as its leading
exemplars, and never placed in the Rudra class. Hence, we have to
understand the twin Rudra-s of the above two ṛk-s differently. First,
their raudra nature is explicitly indicated in the entreaty to be benign
(adruhvāṇeṣam). Second, they are described as sutrātrā, good rescuers,
which immediately brings to mind the Aśvin-s who are frequently invoked
in such a capacity. In the RV, Rudra in singular denotes the god, in his
unitary form, and as the father of his class. Rudra-s in the plural
refer to the entire class or the Marut-s. The dual form of Rudra applies
only to the Aśvin-s everywhere else in the RV. In particular, the Atri-s
repeatedly refer to them as such: e.g., RV 5.73.8, 5.75.3 and in RV
5.41.3 they are invoked together with Rudra as Asuro Divaḥ. Thus, we
posit that in RV 5.70.2-3, Urucakri Ātreya implies the Aśvin-s by the
dual form of Rudra and not the twin Āditya-s.

The last ṛk of the sūkta goes thus:  
mā kasyādbhutakratū yakṣam bhujemā tanūbhiḥ । mā śeṣasā mā tanasā ॥  
May you two of wondrous deeds not make us experience some phantom with
our bodies. Neither with the rest \[of our people\] nor with our
descendants.

The word yakṣa (neuter) could be taken to mean a ghostly apparition or
phantom — perhaps one which causes a disease — a yakṣma. The imploration
is to avoid the possession of the ritualist’s own body or that of this
people or descendants by such a phantom. On the one hand, this is rather
reminiscent of the supplications to Rudra for similar protection, often
with the negative particle mā. On the other, it is reminiscent of the
supplication to Varuṇa to be relieved from his heḷas (=“fury”; also, a
feature of Rudra) for the sins that he unerringly notices. For instance,
we have in the śruti the imploration of Śunaḥśepa:

ava te heḷo varuṇa namobhir  
ava yajñebhir īmahe havirbhiḥ ।  
kṣayann asmabhyam asura pracetā  
rājann enāṃsi śiśrathaḥ kṛtāni ॥ RV 1.24.14  
We avert your fury (heḷas) O Varuṇa with obeisances,  
we implore to avert it by rituals and oblations;  
ruling, for us, O all-seeing Asura,  
you will give release from the sins that were done.

Thus, both Varuṇa and Rudra share not only the heḷas but are also known
as Asura-s (the latter being emphasized for the cognate of Varuṇa in the
Iranic branch of the religion, and remembered for Odin (see below) in
the Northern Germanic religion). Thus, even though Varuṇa or Mitra are
never called Rudra-s, they have a certain overlap of category,
particularly in the actions of Varuṇa, and perhaps, to a degree, in the
Iranic world in the cognate Mitra. We believe that in the sūkta under
consideration, Urucakri Ātreya plays on this overlap in the final ṛk by
not naming any deity but simply using the dual epithet adbhutakratū.
Thus, we suggest that he is purposefully ambivalent to cover both sets
of twin deities referred to in the sūkta — the Āditya dyad or the twin
Rudra-s, i.e., the Aśvin-s. The epithet adbhutakratū will transparently
apply to the Aśvin-s as they are frequently described as wonderworkers
in the śruti. The ṛk could also apply to Mitra and Varuṇa in the sense
of supplication to avoid their heḷas. The invocation of the heḷas of
Mitra, Varuṇa, and the Marut-s, representing the intersection of their
respective functional categories can be seen in RV 1.94.12 composed by
Kutsa Āṅgirasa:

ayam mitrasya varuṇasya dhāyase  
‘vayātām marutāṃ heḷo adbhutaḥ ।  
mṛḷā su no bhūtv eṣām manaḥ punar  
agne sakhye mā riṣāmā vayaṃ tava ॥  
This one is to be fed ghee \[literally suckled\],  
as the wondrous pacifier of the fury of Mitra and Varuṇa, and of the
Maruts.  
Have mercy on us! May the mind of these (the above deva-s) be good
again  
O Agni, in your friendship, may we not be harmed.

This overlap in category has confused some Indo-Europeanists of the
Dumezilianist strain. They have split hairs and gone into contortions
about whether the Germanic Odin represents a cognate of Varuṇa or Rudra.
This ancient functional intersection has meant that one or the other
class of deities could have served as a locus for absorption of traits
of the other.

In our college days, a part time physics teacher from an old and
respected
V_1
clan used to chat with us about issues of mutual interest that were
beyond that of the rest of the class (or for that matter the rest of the
teachers) and well out of the scope of the syllabus. He was the only one
among the physics staff with an interest in science for science’s sake.
We always felt he had it in him to be a scientist and he was indeed was
pursuing a doctoral program at his own pace on the side. However, he
clarified to us that he was the big fish in the small pond and that
every man’s ambition is like a rocket set off on a Dīpāvalī night —
drawing out a parabola on the board he declared with his characteristic
smirk: “It will come down; hence, why trouble yourself with a dizzying
fall”. In course of one involved conversation spanning thermodynamics,
dynamical systems and biological ensembles, he declared to us: “I agree
with you that there are several problems where the actual entities are
fungible. It doesn’t matter if we are dealing with atoms, cells or
animals, they could as well just be numbers. You should explore the
Ising models — maybe you will find something there to answer your
questions.” We are not really into “proving a few theorems”; however,
playing with things on paper or a computer has always excited us. Hence,
the next time we could access a computer we began looking into those
models and soon realized that it could be used to understand some basic
aspects of biological systems.

Here we shall describe some experiments with such models that go no
further than the most basic exploration of these systems. In physics,
such models were first proposed by Lenz and his student Ising. In
sociology, they were introduced by Schelling (of whose work we learnt
much later) who carried out the experiments with a graph paper and
coins. Today we can do them easily by writing some code on a little
computer. The basic rules for the games we shall look at go thus:

1\) The games are played on a lattice on the surface of a torus but for
visualization we shall cut open the torus and render it as a square
board. Thus it would look like this:

![Fig_Schel01](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/fig_schel01.png?w=376&h=373)

2\) Each cell of the lattice can be occupied by an “agent” of one of two
colors (as above) or be empty.  
3) The system has strict conservation laws: the agents can neither be
created nor destroyed and the number of agents of each color will be
conserved.  
4) The neighborhood of an agent is determined by the “span”
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which defines a square grid of a centered on it with
![(2l+1)^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282l%2B1%29%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
neighbors.
![l=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
means a ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grid with the agent at the center and 8 lattice positions available for
neighbors around it. Thus, the agent marked with a black dot (above) has
5 neighbors at
![l=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
2 blue and 3 yellow.
![l=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
means a ![5 \\times
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5+%5Ctimes+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grid with the agent in the center and 24 available lattice positions for
neighbors in two concentric shells around it.  
5) The agency of the agent manifests as its ability to read the number
and color of its neighbors and either stay put where it is or move over
to a random empty cell in the lattice.  
6) Beyond this is there is occupancy,
![o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the fraction of the total available cells in the lattice that are
occupied by agents.

All the experiments described below are played on a ![50 \\times
50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=50+%5Ctimes+50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lattice, i.e. there are 2500 cells available to the agents. In all
experiments, the agents move to an available empty cell if the number of
its neighbors of any color are ![\\le
s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle+s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the sociality factor. Thus, if
![s=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the agent will move from their current location if they have no
neighbors at all. In the first set of experiments, they additionally
sense the the absolute number of non-self neighbors, i.e. those of a
different color and move if it is ![\\ge
c_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cge+c_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the non-self count. The movements of the agents are repeated over and
over until stability is reached or 30 successive rounds of movement have
elapsed. The games are illustrated thus: the plot to the left is the
initial configuration where the agents are randomly introduced into the
lattice and the plot to the right is the final configuration that is
reached as mentioned above. We measure segregation by looking at the
![\\tfrac{n}{s}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bs%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the mean non-self: self ratio in the neighborhood of the agents. As
the agents are randomly introduced, the game would start with
![\\tfrac{n}{s} \\approx
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bs%7D+%5Capprox+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The degree of segregation can be statistically assessed at the beginning
and end of the run by means of the t-test to see if the mean number of
self and non-self agents in the neighborhood of any given agent are
significantly different. At the start of the run the difference would be
insignificant.

Game 1 is a run with low occupancy
![o=0.4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%3D0.4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and an equal number of agents of the two colors (blue and orange);
![l=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. a neighborhood with 8 available cells;
![s=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![c_n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the agents tolerate up to half of the 8 available lattice points in
the neighborhoods being occupied by non-self agents.

[![sch_Fig01](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig01.png?w=600&h=300)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig01.png)Game
1

We see that at the end of the run
![\\tfrac{n}{s}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bs%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
remains close to 1 and the mean number of self and non-self neighbors of
an agent is not significantly different suggesting that tolerating
non-self agents in up to half of the available neighborhoods does not
result in segregation at low occupancy and low sociality.

Game 2 is run with the same parameters as above, except that we increase
sociality
![s=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![sch_Fig02](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig02.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig02.png)  
Game 2

Notably, the increased sociality results in highly significant
segregation. It also results in greater clumping of the agents,
resulting in clustered but clearly segregated domains.

Game 3 is run with the same parameters as Game 1 but we increase the
occupancy
![o=0.6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%3D0.6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![sch_Fig03](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig03.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig03.png)Game
3

Here, we see a small but significant reduction of
![\\tfrac{n}{s}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bs%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, increasing the population with same level of tolerance for
non-self by itself results in some segregation that is not seen at low
occupancy.

Game 4 is run with
![l=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus, the agent responds to the status of the 24 available lattice
points of the neighborhood around it. The occupancy is low
![o=.4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%3D.4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![c_n=
11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_n%3D+11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
i.e. less than half the available neighborhood positions tolerated as
non-self;
![s=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![sch_Fig04](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig04.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig04.png)

Game 4

In these runs we often seen no significant segregation of the agents
despite the relatively low tolerance to non-self; however, we see
greater clumping of the agents resulting in a more anisotropic
distribution of the agents at the conclusion of the run. Thus, when
larger neighborhoods are sensed by the agents, even relatively low
tolerance for non-self is overridden under low occupancy leading to
paradoxical clumping of self and non-self into spatially restricted
domains.

Game 5 is similar to 4 but the sociality of the agents is increased to
![s=8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![sch_Fig05](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig05.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig05.png)  
Game 5

This change has the dramatic effect of moving the agents towards strong
segregation along with formation closely packed monotypic domains of the
two agents, with clear boundaries. Thus, the sociality parameter drives
a phase transition from packing with little segregation despite
relatively strong non-self tolerance to nearly complete separation into
domains with shared borders.

Game 6 is different from the previous ones in that it senses the
relative non-self fraction rather than the absolute count of non-self in
the neighborhood,
![f_n=\\tfrac{c_n}{c_t}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bc_n%7D%7Bc_t%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![c_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the total number of occupied lattice points in the neighborhood. The
sociality factor
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is applied just as in the above cases. In this run, we set
![s=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the agent moves only if it has no neighbors.
![f_n=.7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n%3D.7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e., the agent move only if the fraction of its non-self neighbors is
greater or equal to
![f_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, if an agent has 5 neighbors and 4 of them are non-self then
![f_n=0.8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n%3D0.8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and it would move. We set it to a low occupancy of
![o=0.4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%3D0.4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![sch_Fig06](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig06.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/sch_fig06.png)

Game 6

We observe that even with a low occupancy, high tolerance for non-self
and low sociality, relative sensing drives significant segregation.
Thus, with relative sensing the
![f_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the primary determinant of segregation.

What might be some real-life scenarios where these games matter? We can
easily imagine the system of agents being a set of living cells showing
their agency in response to chemotactic signals. At a macroscopic level,
we can imagine these as individual animals (e.g. humans). Indeed, Game 6
was the one played by Schelling as a model for the sociology of
segregation. In terms of cells, we can conceive of the following
mechanisms: 1) cells are primitively motile; hence, they can move. 2)
they can exhibit sociality by means of adhesion molecules (usually
proteins) that are expressed on the cell surface. Unless these adhesion
interactions are satisfied to a given degree, they would keep moving. 3)
They can sense self from non-self. In the simplest case this can again
happen via adhesion molecules. Indeed, such mechanisms are used by fungi
and ciliates, among others, for discriminating self from non-self for
mating or hyphal anastomosis. This kind of adhesion-based self-non-self
discrimination can be a mechanism of sensing the absolute number of
non-self neighbors. Alternatively, it can happen through sensing of
diffusible signals. This mechanism is best suited for relative sensing
of the ratio of non-self to total neighbors. Either way the cellular
agent could respond to nonself agents in the environment.

Thus, these simple models show how the interplay of sociality and
non-self tolerance can result in segregation or paradoxical grouping. In
the case of relative sensing (game 6), even with high tolerance and low
sociality we see segregation. This is the reality of human societies
that many modern occidentally oriented social observers find very hard
to swallow. But they are simply tilting against a mathematical reality,
much like their medieval representative, old Don Quixote, charging a
windmill. Similarly, absolute-count-sensing shows the role of sociality
and crowding in segregation (e.g. Games 2, 3 and 5). Greater crowding
and sociality can lead to greater segregation when compared to the same,
relatively high, tolerance for non-self under low crowding and
sociality. Similarly, certain middling level of sociality with sensing
of larger neighborhoods can trigger long-lasting clustering without
strong segregation despite lower than half tolerance for absolute number
non-self agents in the available neighborhood spots (Game 4). This
scenario could explain the grouping of bacteria in mixed species
biofilms or relatively long-lived clustering of distinct groups in a
social setting, e.g. the jāti-s in an Indian village. In conclusion,
some social phenomena can be accounted for by simple lattice models of
agents which are entirely agnostic to the actual mechanism of agency and
sensing.

It was early in the school year and the last class for the week, the
English class. The students were restless as the sea at the time of the
tide from the pull of the impending weekend. For the first time in his
life, school seemed to hold something of interest to Somakhya as he had
just made acquaintance with the clever girl of the Aṅgiras-es. However,
at that point he was lost in working out the geometry of a new chaotic
map he had discovered. Vidrum, who sat beside him, peeked into his work,
trying to follow it, but soon lost track of the scribbles of his
algebra. Just then the English teacher entered the class and surveyed
the mood in the room, twirling his chastising rod. The more rowdy
students were in a raucous mood. Mahish and Gardabh were singing a
cyclical song using their desks, lunch boxes and water bottles as
percussion surfaces. The song ran thus in a local apabhraṃsha:  
There was a man.  
The man had a wife.  
The wife birthed a boy.  
The boy became a man  
The man had a wife.  
\<repeat>

Episodically, Mudgar decorated the song with single-word interjections
comprised of salacious apabhraṃsha words. The English teacher swung his
cane and charged towards them: “If I hear anymore of this I’ll have you
all stand outside the class.” Sensing the students’ mood, as he did once
or twice a month, he decided to provide some exit for the steam building
in his restless class: “Today we shall not have any lesson. Instead, I
will let two of you all tell the rest of the class a story. You must
hear the story quietly without interrupting and I will give you’ll five
minutes at the end of each story to ask questions and discuss it. I’ll
be choosing one boy and one girl to tell the story; however, be warned,
I will not tolerate any lewd story and shall punish you if you narrate
one. Today, I’m selecting Sharvamanyu as the boy who shall tell us the
first story. Come to the front of the class.”

Sharvamanyu did so and narrated a tale of a Marāṭhā or a Piṇḍārī evading
a wild chase from the English army and finally ending up eaten by a
mugger crocodile. After a lively discussion for five minutes the teacher
said: “As most of you’ll would have noticed, we have a new girl in the
class this year, Lootika. She did extraordinarily well in the surprise
entrance test we administered to verify her candidacy for admission to
our school. As you know, our institution strives for high standards and
hopes to send students to the best colleges by ranking in the highest
decile in the school-leaving certificate. She shows promise to be one of
our good students in final reckoning three years from now. Hence, I
select her as the girl who will tell the next story.”

As Lootika came to the front of the class, Mudgar whistled loudly, even
as Mahish made an obscene gesture and shouted, “Four eyes!”, alluding to
to Lootika’s spectacles. Lootika retorted: “Hey buffalo dung-skull!”.
The English teacher struck Mudgar with his cudgel, even as
[Mudgar](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-iii/)
himself might have played a square cut on the field of cricket, and
swinging it menacingly he and went up to Mahish: “Lootika, stop
counter-swearing and tell your story. I’m the one supposed to maintain
discipline here. Mahish, I’d already warned you. Now, you shall stand
outside class, next to the door. The next time you do something like
this, my stick will mightily kiss you.”

With Mahish evicted from the class, Lootika told them the following
story:  
Friends, I will tell you a story that is believed by some to have been
composed by a certain Viṣṇuśarman. However, it is possible that it was a
folktale that was later inserted into the older work of Viṣṇuśarman. I
am going to follow the plot of the original closely but tell it in my
own words. In a certain town in central India lived four brāhmaṇa
youths, who were great friends. They were very poor and, as is usual,
the richer folk shunned them. They felt that nobody appreciated them for
their good qualities and no woman showed any interest in them due their
poverty. Tired of their destitution, they decided to seek a fortune
elsewhere. They declared that it was better to live in the jungle
wearing bark-fiber vestures than to be among their kin while being
indigent. Wandering a long way, they eventually reached the river Śiprā
in the environs of Avanti and took a dip in the tīrtha. Having ritually
purified themselves, they set out to the great temple of Mahākāla and
worshiped the god sincerely. As they were making their way out, they ran
into the great Śaiva yogin Bhairavānanda. He was a profound master of
the Śaiva lore. Having toiled through the voluminous tantra-s of the
tradition of Īśāna, Tumburu and the four sisters, Garuḍa and the
Bhūta-s, he attained the pinnacle of his mastery through the study of
the Bhairava-tantra-s. Thus, he became a renowned teacher with a school
at Avanti.

Having fallen at his feet, the four youths accompanied Bhairavānanda to
the hall of his school: “Young men what do you seek?”. The four: “Sir,
we are very poor. We have decided that we shall either become lords of
wealth or die in the attempt. We have heard of your great renown in the
magical arts, the nidhividyā by which a man finds subterranean wealth or
the kauberīvidyā by which one can locate the great stores of wealth that
the lord of the yakṣa-s has provisioned at secluded spots on this earth.
We are exceedingly brave and committed, and are willing to perform bold
or arduous acts to succeed in this regard. Please inform us of the right
way — whether we should seek deep cavernous mines, or perform
Bhairava-sādhana in the cremation grounds, or worship the goddess
Śākini, or sell human meat to attain our goal.” Bhairavānanda took pity
on the youths and brought out four cotton wicks from his sacristy:
“Young men, proceed north to the Himālayas towards the source of the
Sindhu river along the the route I shall lay out. These wicks will act
like dowsing rods. As you climb the slopes of the great mountain, if the
wick accidentally drops from your hand dig at that spot. You will
definitely come upon some great source of wealth. Collect it and return
home.” Having consented, the four youths hurried along on their
Himālayan expedition, pregnant with excitement. They made a pact that
they would share whatever wealth they might obtain upon the dropping of
the wick. After a few days of wandering in the regions where the Sindhu
river descends from the great mountain glacier, the wick of one of the
men dropped. They quickly excavated the spot and soon hit a lode of
copper. The man whose wick dropped said: “Let us take this wealth and
return. We can make quite a gain from selling this copper and establish
ourselves.” The three other friends shot back: “You are welcome to
return with all the copper you want. We have three more wicks and hope
to discover even greater stuff than this red metal.”

Thus, the three proceeded; in a while one of their wicks dropped. This
time their excavation yielded a lode of silver. The youth said to his
friends let us take this silver and return — we have done much better
than a mere mass of copper that our poor friend settled for. The two
others retorted: “We hit copper first and now silver. Do we need to tell
you what lies ahead?” The man who found the silver said: “I’m content
with this silver and will take it and return.” The two others pressed on
and neared a dizzying cataract on the Sindhu. There the third wick
dropped. They dug up that spot and caught the gleam of huge nuggets of
gold. The lad whose wick had fallen said that they their quest had truly
ended as there was nothing more to find and urged that they split the
gold between themselves and go back home. His companion thundered. You
are a fool. We still have a wick left. Why should we waste this
blessing, which has come to us from the great Mahādeva himself via the
mantravādin Bhairavānanda. Each time around we have greater success. You
may return with your gold if you choose, I am going to press on alone —
I believe I’ll find diamonds and sapphires, which will yield us more
wealth than gold. The youth who found gold said that he would wait for
his friend to return at that spot and they could go back home together.

The fourth lad pressed on but soon realized that he had lost his way as
saw none of the landmarks which Bhairavānanda had indicated to them. He
found himself going in circles and ran out of water. To break the cycle
and find some water he just marched ahead on a straight line. Soon he
came upon a ghastly sight. A man stood in the midst of a cold plateau
with his body bespattered with gore. On his head spun a wheel on a peg
that seemed to trepan his skull and blood freely spurted out of that
perforation. The fourth youth asked this unfortunate man: “What the hell
are you doing to yourself? Is there someplace I can find water?” As soon
as he spoke that wheel flew away from the man’s head and dropped on the
head of the fourth lad and began drilling into it. He yelled: “Ouch,
what is this!”. The man who had just been relieved of the wheel said to
him: “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for relieving me. I don’t
know how long I have been waiting for your arrival.” The fourth lad: “I
don’t understand, please get this wheel of my head”. The original
wheel-bearer: “Young man, like you, I too had sought wealth from the
dropping of the final wick. Thus, did I reach this spot and had the
wheel jump on to my head from another unfortunate soul from Tibet who
stood here bearing wheel before me. When another man with a wick comes
this way, you too will be eventually relieved.” The fourth lad:“How long
have you been here?” The former wheel-bearer: “It seems like eons. Who
is the emperor of India now?” The fourth lad: “When we left on our
expedition, queen Mṛgāvati had just handed over the throne to her son
Udayana Vatsarāja, who mightily lords over the land from Kauśāmbī.” The
original wheel-bearer: “Oh, I’ve never heard of him. When I left home,
Rāmacandra Aikṣvākava held sway over the land from the city of Ayodhyā,
like an Indra on earth.” The fourth youth shrieked in pain: “What! that
is terrible — it must be more than a 1000 years. How is that even
possible!”. The old wheel-bearer: “Well, this is the punishment that has
been set up by the great yakṣa Naravāhana. Indeed, it has been said that
the man who seeks to plunder that which belongs to the great deity of
the North is penalized thus. As you would have noticed, your thirst
should have left you — deathless, hungerless, thirstless but full of
unrelenting pain, like me, you too shall suffer this wheel of Kubera
till someone else comes by with a wick. Thank you and I shall now take
leave.”

Having waited long for his friend the third youth followed his footsteps
and eventually found him suffering the torture of the wheel. Having
heard his tale the third youth said: “Friend, I told you that we had met
our ultimate aim in gold. But lacking sense and fueled by false
extrapolations you went ahead. Now I’ll have to leave you and return.”
The fourth lad: “You are such a heartless fellow to betray your friend
in suffering and return to a life a wealth. You can only be called a
traitor who will go to naraka.” The third lad: “That would be so if I
were in situation where I could have helped you. No human can ever free
you from this punishment which has been inflicted by none other than the
great Vaiśravaṇa. Seeing the pain on your face from the boring of your
skull, my instincts tell me that I should leave this place right away —
I sense the deepest dangers lurking in this spot from the dreadful
agents of Kāmeśvara. Goodbye.”

As Lootika finished her tale, some of her classmates, Tumul, Vakraas,
Skambhakay and Muhira started loudly vocalizing: “boo…boo… what a boring
story! Lootika is a bore!” The English teacher intervened: “Stop it or
I’ll whack you. Lootika, I want you to ignore them and quietly go back
to your desk. It was an excellent story, capped with a didactic
flourish, which introduced the class to trivia of history, geography and
quaint superstitions reminding one of the notorious
[Rasgol-bābājī](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/leaves-from-the-scrapbook-4/).
Lootika also introduced few words and phrases that some of you’ll might
not be familiar with. Note those, check their meanings in the
dictionary, and write down sentences with each of them. Now, Tumul,
stand up and tell the class what you thought was the message of the
story?” Tumul: “Sir, it is was just a long-winded way of saying a simple
sentence: it is bad to be greedy. Other than that, the story does not
make much sense, and as you said, master, it talks about all kinds of
superstitions that cannot be true — Lootika doesn’t seem to know even
basic physics — a wheel cannot spin by itself forever. it seems she just
wants to show off that she knows some words from the dead language
Sanskrit in an English class. Moreover, how much copper ore can a single
man take back home from high in the mountains. Surely, it will not be
enough to even pay for his food and boarding on the way back. As a
Brahmin girl, Lootika is simply following the example of how her kind
has operated since time immemorial — obfuscate simple, common sense
things with elaborate stories packed with mumbo-jumbo.” The English
teacher: “Tumul, you are unable to get the device of a metaphor. Now it
is you who are are being long-winded to be mean to your classmate. We
need to be more welcoming to our new students. Hence, I want you to
write out the whole story in your own words properly explaining its
significance and bring it over to me next fortnight. Now, Somakhya stand
up and tell the class what you think about the story.”

Somakhya: “I think there are two ways, not mutually exclusive, to look
at it. First, due to conservation laws and the principle of entropy
growth can never be infinite. Hence, if you keep on the growth curve you
will go up and eventually down. Second, you could look at it as the
problem of the gambler’s ruin at a casino. Even if the gambler makes
some gains, eventually he will be ruined if the probability of loss is
lesser than or equal to 0.5. In both these, which have bearing on real
life, the big question is when exactly to bail out. If you bail out too
soon you may catch much less of the growth or gain than those who stuck
on longer but stay too long and you will go bust. That’s the metaphor of
the wheel of Kubera. But making that decision can be extraordinarily
difficult.”

The English teacher: “That is a practical take. Vidrum, what do you have
to say?” Vidrum: “Based on what Somakhya has said, I think the whole
story is a metaphor for participating in pyramid schemes like
cryptocurrency. If you know when to quit you can retire with good money
but if you don’t you can sink into misery like that fourth chap. Hence,
I think persistence might be an overrated quality and quitting often
might after all help.” E.T: “That last sentence is a rather negative
take and I believe a fallacious inference from the story. Hemling, I see
you gesticulating and getting excited. Did you understand the story and
have anything to say?” Hemling: “ The problem looks hard because the
gain function in Lootika’s example is discrete. If it were a continuous
function that were differentiable throughout then I think we could for
most part use the derivative of the function to reach some conclusions
regarding when it would right to bail out. For typical gain functions in
real life you have decrease in the magnitude of the derivative as you
are nearing the peak. That should give you a reasonably precise
indication of when to quit.” The English teacher seemed confused:
“Hemling, you better keep that stuff for your math class.”

ET: “Sumalla, what do you have to say about the story?” Sumalla smiled
and puckered her lips and face, uttering a lot of filler words to make
up for the lack of anything substantial to say. Finally, she managed to
string a few grammatical sentences: “I love diamonds and also sapphires
but I would be happy to settle for gold. Lootika always has something
more to say any topic. Sir, please ask her if there is some secret
message in this story.” ET: “Alright, Lootika, I’ll permit you to have
the last word on your story.”

L: “First, I think Tumul is a fool. He for one should brush up his
physics by reading about photovoltaic cells — something like that could
have kept the wheel spinning.” E.T.: “I don’t want you to go there
Lootika. Stick to your story.” L: “I think the boys have more or less
covered the basic message of the difficulty that we constantly face in
life with respect to the quitting problem. However, I’m not sure if
Vidrum’s strategy of quitting often is the winning one in an unqualified
setting. Maybe it can be explored by means of computer simulations. I’d
also add that these problems are made more complex by hidden variables
that we cannot see or whose causal chain is too complex for us to trace
— like what decided whose wick would fall when. Hence, as a general
lesson, it is good to think in terms of the nature of probability
distributions and perform cost-benefit analysis accordingly while making
life decisions. That said, life in the margins with some copper is much
better than getting trepanned.”

Just then the bell rang announcing the end of the class and the school
closed for the weekend. Lootika realized that there were classmates who
hated her and might want to have a go at her for the punishment they had
suffered. Hence, she quickly scurried over to Somakhya and his gang.
Thus, shielded by her friend she exited the school premises.

As the pandemic grinds to a close or at least to a pause in some parts
of the world, there is a certain fear from new mutants threaten that
threaten break current the status quo. The strain that arose in the deś
is a case in point. This short note is some bālabodhana on how
understand some of the basics of the mutational process.

At the most fundamental level, biology is written in a 4 letter alphabet
— the four nucleotides (A, G, C, T/U). A RNA virus, like SARS-CoV-2, has
U, whereas cellular DNA genomes have T instead. Any biological word,
i.e. string of nucleotides, occupies a node in a graph (network). This
graph might be seen as multi-layered where in each layer
![l_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
contains all words of length
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In the subgraph corresponding to any given layer 2 nodes are connected
by an edge if they differ by a single letter, i.e. a single substitution
can change the word corresponding to a node to that corresponding to the
node to which it is connected by an edge. Thus, there are 4 words of a
single nucleotide
![(l_1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28l_1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are all connected to each other, i.e. a tetrahedral graph.

[![Mutation_network](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/mutation_network.png?w=406&h=361)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/mutation_network.png)

With 2 letters (dinucleotides)
![l_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have ![4 \\times 4 =
16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+4+%3D+16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
possible words and the graph is way more complicated as each node can be
connected to 6 other nodes.

[![Mutation_network2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/mutation_network2.png?w=539&h=425)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/mutation_network2.png)

One can easily see that
![l_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will define a tetrahedron in 3D Euclidean space. However, any biological
word of ![L \\ge
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%5Cge+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cannot be faithfully visualized in our everyday 3D space, as it will
require many more dimensions to render it with real edge-lengths. Thus,
as Martin Nowak stated, biological words are rich in dimensions but
short on distance. For simplicity, we draw our graphs in whatever
dimensions are easily grasped by us (i.e. 2D as above) and simply take
each edge of the graph to be measured as a non-Euclidean length. In
reality, not just the topology of the graph but also the length of the
edges matter. Nucleotides are more likely to mutate to the same type (
pyrimidine (U/T)
![\\leftrightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleftrightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pyrimidine (C), purine (A)
![\\leftrightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleftrightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
purine (G)) rather than a different type (i.e. purine
![\\leftrightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleftrightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pyrimidine). Thus, the lengths of edges corresponding to heterotypic
substitutions are longer than those corresponding to homotypic edges.
However, for convenience we shall simplify the situation by taking all
edges to be of length 1. Thus, the distance between two nodes will be
length along the graph: in the dinucleotide example shown above the
distance between AA and AG will be 1, while that between AA and GG will
be 2. Thus, for
![L=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
while paths of various lengths are possible, from one node you can reach
every other node with path of at most length 2. This shortest distance
along the graph,
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
between 2 nodes is no different from the so called Manhattan metric or
Hamming distance.

Some of the nodes on a given layer
![l_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are connected nodes on
![l\_{i+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l_%7Bi%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by an edge too because by the addition or subtraction of a nucleotide
you go from a sequence of length
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![L+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and vice versa. However, given that you can have in a single step such
additions and deletions of arbitrary length you can also connect
sequences of various lengths by these length 1 edges coming from the
so-called deletions and insertions. For this simple examination we shall
ignore those types of mutations.

The basic, necessary process of life may be defined as the copying of an
biological word, in its maximal form a genome, by a nucleic acid
polymerase. All polymerases are prone to error when they make new copy
of the genome from the existing template. We may define this error by
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the probability of single nucleotide substitution at a arbitrary
position in the genome. Then
![1-u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the probability of the genome being copied correctly. This leads us
to a key equation that measures mutation in the genome, i.e. probability
![p\_{ij}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bij%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that the copying of genome
![i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
results in a mutant genome
![j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![p\_{ij}=u^{D\_{ij}}(1-u)^{L-D\_{ij}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bij%7D%3Du%5E%7BD_%7Bij%7D%7D%281-u%29%5E%7BL-D_%7Bij%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here,
![D\_{ij}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_%7Bij%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the shortest distance along the graph between sequences ![i,
j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%2C+j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the length of the genome. Wrapped into this are two simplifying
assumptions: 1)
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is constant throughout the genome and 2) it is independent of mutations
at other sites.

I could not find a proper estimate of
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for SARS-CoV-2. However, a closely related coronavirus, with a
similar-sized genome, the Mouse Hepatitis Virus RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase has
![u=10^{-6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D10%5E%7B-6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The same may be safely used for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the probability that
the viral polymerase makes a copy with no mutation at all, with ![L
\\approx 3 \\times
10^4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%5Capprox+3+%5Ctimes+10%5E4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
is given as:

![(1-u)^L=0.97](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-u%29%5EL%3D0.97&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For a comparison, the HIV-1 virus reverse transcriptase has
![u=3\\times10^{-5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D3%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![L=9400](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3D9400&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus
![(1-u)^L=0.75](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-u%29%5EL%3D0.75&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Therefore, HIV-1 is a far more mutation-prone virus, which copies its
genome without a mutation only 3/4th of the times. The higher fidelity
of replication of the coronavirus is a consequence of its distinctive
proofreading 3′-5′ exoribonuclease, which the HIV-1 reverse
transcriptase lacks. This increased fidelity is keeping with its ![3.19
\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3.19+%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
larger genome, coding for several more proteins than HIV-1.

Conversely, consider the probability that a specific point mutant arises
upon replication of the coronavirus genome. For example, the mutation in
the Spike protein E484K can confer resistance to some of the typical
antibodies made against the wild type Wuhan strain. This is a
substitution of K for E which can arise from a single ![A \\to
G](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cto+G&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
point mutation. This probability can be calculated using the above
formula with
![D\_{ij}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_%7Bij%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence,

![u(1-u)^{L-1}=9.7\\times
10^{-7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%281-u%29%5E%7BL-1%7D%3D9.7%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

When a virus infects a cell, it makes numerous copies of itself and
these “burst” out eventually resulting in the death of the cell. The
number of such copies that emerge out from the cell on an average is
termed the burst size. To our knowledge, there are no recent studies on
burst size estimates for coronaviruses. However, a study in 1976 by N.
Hirano et al estimated it to be about 600-700 virus particles, again
using the Mouse Hepatitis Virus in a tissue culture system. By taking a
burst size of 650, one would need ![\\approx
1585](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1585&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
successfully infected cells producing bursts of this size for a specific
point mutation, like the above mentioned one in the spike protein, to
emerge. During peak SARS-CoV-2 infection, an individual is estimated as
carrying ![\\approx
10^{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+10%5E%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
virus particles based on calculations of Sender et al. Hence, a
particular point mutation can emerge in an infected individual
![\\approx
9704](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+9704&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
times.

If a point mutation confers some selective advantage, like the
above-mentioned immune escape mutation, then even with the low error
replication of coronaviruses relative to HIV-1, they have ample
potential for developing escape mutations. Consistent with this
estimate, we saw the E484K mutation repeatedly emerge in different
lineages that showed antibody escape, such as the B.1.351 variant that
arose in South Africa, the P.1 variant that arose in Brazil and the
within the B.1.1.7 lineage in the UK. Finally, a serial passaging
experiment by Andreano et al of the virus with plasma from a recovered
patient found that for 7 passages the plasma neutralized the virus;
thereafter point mutations emerged that allowed escape and eventually
complete resistance to the plasma. One of these was the E484K. The
evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, assuming that it broke out in Wuhan,
China, in November 2019 was one of relative stasis for about an year
followed by emergence of several mutants that allowed immune escape. The
among these were the multiple emergences of E384 point mutations. This
suggests that for the first year the virus was rampaging through a
relatively immunologically naïve population with little advantage for
specific point mutations. However, as pandemic response measures and the
virus load in the population greatly increased, there was an advantage
for specific mutants. The above numbers show that point mutations were
the easiest path to this, as seen with the emergence of variants with
mutations such as D614G, E484K etc.

Yet, we see that the vaccination programs have played a big role in
bringing the pandemic under control in several parts of the world. Why
has it worked, given the above? For this let us take a closer look at
the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

[![CoronaSpike](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/coronaspike.png?w=448&h=504)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/coronaspike.png)

Roughly
![90\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=90%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the antibodies against this virus are directed at the Spike (S)
protein. The above picture shows the spike with the top part being the
surface which it contacts the ACE2 receptor on the host. Within the
spike protein the residues that are targeted by 5 distinct classes of
antibodies are marked in different colors on a single monomer colored
cyan, while the other two monomers of the trimer are shown in
transparent light yellow. The majority of antibodies target the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD), while the minority target the N-terminal
galectin-like domain (dark violet). First, since, there are at least 5
distinct classes of antibodies, the escape via a point mutation could be
compensated by the binding of one of the other classes. Second, the
titer of antibodies seems to matter a lot in terms of immunity.
Individuals with high titer seem to be able to overcome much of the
escape by single mutants like E484K. Third, there is the cellular
immunity. Thus, the vaccine are in most part likely generating high
enough titers of antibodies of different classes to make up for escape
by single point mutations and a reasonable cellular immunity.

Now, to escape a whole class of antibodies one might typically need 3 or
more point mutations. We can compute the probability of 3 point
mutations arising from one replication of the virus as
![u^3(1-u)^{L-3}=9.7 \\times
10^{-19}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%5E3%281-u%29%5E%7BL-3%7D%3D9.7+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-19%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This means it is very unlikely to ever arise in a single person in
single replication ![(p \\approx 9.7 \\times
10^{-9})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p+%5Capprox+9.7+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-9%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For a comparison, the probability of a round of replication producing a
triple mutation in HIV-1 is ![2.03 \\times
10^{-14}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2.03+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-14%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
On a given day, an infected person carries about ![2 \\times
10^{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
HIV-1 particles; hence a person has only a ![4.1\\times
10^{-4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4.1%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of developing a triple mutant in a single replication. However, 1 in
every 2455 persons infected with HIV-1 can develop such a mutant in
single round of replication. Hence, it has not been possible to
vaccinate against it. However, as the serial passage experiment
illustrated, in successive rounds of selection for individual point
mutations one could eventually get to total resistance with SARS-CoV-2.
The B.1.617.2
![(\\delta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cdelta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
variant has already shown the capacity to partially break through the
commonly used Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca vaccines in the least. In theory
it is possible that a strain that is entirely resistant to the
antibodies generated by the vaccine could arise in the relatively near
future. Fortunately, antibodies are not the only aspect of immunity as
they can also trigger cellular immunity. Hence, at least for the near
future, with all aspects of immunity put together, the vaccines are
likely to provide some level of protection. However, the strong
selection pressure they are imposing on the S protein could result in
the emergence of more consequential escape mutants. Hence, there is a
lingering danger of the disease persisting in some form.

O fire mother,  
whose father is flint,  
whose mother is pebble,  
whose meal is yellow feather grass,  
whose life is an elm tree.  
An incantation to the Fire Goddess Ghalun-eke; translation from the
Mongolian by Yönsiyebü Rinchen

This note revisits some themes relating to the Mongol religion gathered
in the 1950s and 1960s by the Mongol scholar Yönsiyebü Rinchen from the
Mongolian Academy of Science, Ulaanbaatar. He says that he descends on
his father’s side from an ancient Hunnic clan founded by a certain
Yöngsiyebü, who was the lord of a tümen. He records an oral chant
preserved by the clan on this ancient ancestor of theirs. On his
mother’s side he claims descent from Chingiz Khan via Tsoktu Taiji
(1581-1637 CE), the chief of Kokonor, who aided the practitioners of the
ancient Bon religion of Tibet before they fell to the bauddha-s backed
by the Oirat Mongols. Rinchen, with his connections to the old Mongol
religion prior to its fall to the bauddha-s, records several notable
features of its practice. As we have noted before on these pages, the
fall of the old religion to the bauddha-s was neither smooth nor
complete. In addition to the material collected by Heissig, we have
deprecations such as this one from the old shamans against the religion
and followers of the tathāgata invoking at the black (qara) “ghosts” or
“spirits”:

O you, you who come to eat 90 bhikṣu-s,  
and returns to eat 100,000 bhikṣu-s,  
O you, you who come riding the frenzied wolves,

Translation from the Mongolian by Yönsiyebü Rinchen

The old Mongol religion was organized thus:

As one can see from the diagram their world is heavy in what might be
termed “ghosts” or “spirits”, which are incorporeal presences of
ancestors. Of the gods themselves, there were the 99 tengri-s who are
mentioned in the famous kindling fire hymn of the clan of Chingiz Khan.
They were headed by the tengri Qormusta Khan Tengri, who was also known
as Köke Möngke Tengri, and associated with the great blue sky. The
latter name of his seems to have been the original Mongol name that is
encountered in the Chingizid epic. The former name seen in texts like
the Mongolian Geser Khan epic is transparently a tadbhava of the great
Iranian Varuṇa-like deity Ahura Mazda. His later iconography closely
converged to that of the ārya Indra, paralleling tendencies on the
Indo-Iranian borderlands. Of these tengri-s, 55 are seen as benevolent
and white in color; 44 are black in color, wrathful and destructive, but
their fury is directed at the enemies of the Mongol nation. We had
earlier discussed some of the other Tengri-s. We know much lesser of the
77 Earth Mothers, the natigai, with the exception of the fire-goddess
Ghalun-eke, whose elm tree “samidh-s” are well-known from multiple
surviving Mongol kindling incantations, [including the aforementioned
one of Chingiz
Khan](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/23/the-fire-hymns-of-the-mongols/).
These high deities are common to the Mongol peoples, and are worshiped
by the elite (tsaghan yasun or the white bones) and the high shamans in
special community rituals.

Rinchen recognizes two levels of shamans. The high shamans involved in
worship the tengri and the great ghosts or spirits and are known as
jhigharin (shamans) and abjhiy-a (shamanesses). The lower ghosts are
invoked primarily by a lower grade of shamans known as böge (shamans)
and idughan (shamanesses). The former word is related to the Turkic
bögü, who was a shaman-magician of the pre-Abrahamistic Turks. The words
might be related to the Iranic Baga (Sanskrit: Bhaga), as the name of an
Āditya god or a respected one with divine capacity (e.g. Skt: bhagavat).
In this regard, it may be noted that, at least since the Kirghiz
Khaganate, the Turkic shaman was more commonly known as the kham or the
kham khatun (female). It was explained in the Sogdhian Iranic dialect as
the prophet of Baga (Sogdhian: faghīnūn, c.f. faghfur for Bagaputhra
used similarly to the Chinese title of Tianzi by Eastern Iranic
emperors). The lower shamans were deployed for commonplace religion and
for the quotidian needs of the lay populace (qara yasun or the black
bones). For special occasions, the qara yasun might call upon the high
shamans for more involved rituals. One of these was the mysterious
weather magic that was shared by the Turks and the Mongols, done with
what was known as a “rain stone” or a “snow stone”. In times of peace,
this shamanic magic was used to help during droughts and was observed
closer to our times by Russians and Russified Germans during their
exploration of the Mongolian east. However, there are several accounts
of such as a tactic in warfare, some of which we shall describe below.

From the Pre-Mongolic times we have the account of a Zoroastrian Iranian
encyclopedist, who among other things compiled a version of the
Pañcatantra, preserved via Gardīzī. He recorded that such a rain-stone
magic was in the possession of the ancestral Turk and its inheritance
was contested among the Khazar (the Judaistic Turks), the Oghuz (from
whom descend the Black and White Sheep Turks, the Khwarizm Shahs/Qangli
Turks, the Osmans and Seljuks, who may have originally been a Judaistic
branch of them before becoming Mohammedans) and the Khalji-s (from who
descend the monstrous tyrants of India like Jalal al Dīn and Alla al
Dīn). The Oghuz are said to have obtained the stone by giving their
cousins fake versions. Isma’il ibn Ahmad the Sāmānid Sultan mentions
that during his slaving jihad on the heathen Turks, their high shamans
deployed the rain-stone magic stirring up a hailstorm. However, the
Sultan grandiosely claims that he deployed his Mohammedan Allah magic
and backhurled the hailstorm on the Turks. This was perhaps an old motif
in Turko-Mongol tradition because it makes its reappearance in the
Chingizid epic, when the great Khan was facing facing the confederation
of the Naiman Turks. Their shamans raised a blizzard against the Mongols
but the Khan’s invocation of Köke Möngke Tengri turned the blizzard
against the Naimans. However, the Mongols too described their shamans
successfully deploying the rain-stone magic in war. During the sack of
Khwarizm, the Mongols spared the life of a Qangli Turk who still
remembered the old heathen ways and incorporated him into their shaman
contingent for weather magic. When Chingiz Khan’s youngest Tolui was
leading the Mongol army against the Jin, he was ambushed surrounded by
them. He is said to have had his shamans, including the said Turk,
deploy the great blizzard magic, which caused confusion among the Jin,
and allowed the Mongols to cut them down. Later after the fall of the
Mongol Khaganate, when the belligerent Han under the Ming emperor
invaded Mongolia, Biligtü Khan Āyuśrīdhara the son of Toghon Temür
organized the defense of his homeland. In the fierce battle in Orkhon,
when it looked like Mongolia might fall, the Mongol shamans are said to
have deployed the “snow-stone” magic, resulting in many Han freezing to
death in the holes they dug to keep themselves warm on the steppe.
Biligtü Khan is said to have then rallied the Mongols to save Mongolia
from the Cīna-s drive them beyond the wall.

This use of the rain-stones and snow-stones continued even after the
Islamization of the Mongols of the Chagadai Khanate in the West. In
great battle near Tashkent, between the Chagadai Khan Ilyas Khoja and
the [alliance of Timur and Mir
Hussain](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/02/15/the-rise-of-timur-i-leng/),
the former first attacked the Mongols and gained some success and called
on Mir Hussain to attack the other flank of the Mongols. At that point,
the Mongol shamans were called to deploy the rain-stones and a
thunderstorm is said to have struck the side of Hussain who was then
smashed by the Mongols. Timur tried to rally the forces but he too was
hammered by the Chagadais and forced to retreat losing several thousands
of men. Finally, the Timurid Mogol Abu Sa\`id himself is said to have
had Özbek Mongols in his retinue perform the same magic to obtain rain
to alleviate their thirst when they ran out of water on the steppe in
1451 CE. Interestingly, the English agents at Madras note that
Chatrapati Śivājī sent a brāhmaṇa Mahāḍjī Pant to obtain the same kind
of stones from them. However, it is not clear if the Chatrapati wanted
them for some magical purpose or as medicine. While there have been
records of this ritual in inner and outer Mongolia in the last 150 years
with a smooth white stone the size of a pheasant’s egg and a ceramic
bottle in which it is placed, unfortunately, we know little of the
incantations.

We know more of the traditions relating to the genii, which are an
amalgam of ancestor worship, apotheosis and reverse euhemerism. Rinchen
holds that the distinction between the different types of genii follow
the status of their living progenitors. The ghosts of the great Mongol
lords of clans and great Khans are said to become the “lord spirits”,
who are invoked in special rites by the entire clan or nation. These
usually require the great shamans and shamanesses for the invocation
ritual and have survived the bauddha takeover surviving within the
tāthāgata pantheon. The spirits of the noted shamans, i.e. jhigharin and
abjhiy-a become the “protector spirits”, while those of the lower grade
böge and idughan shamans become the “guardian spirits” who are usually
genii of loci. The loci themselves, usually in the vicinity of their
graves, were marked by heaps of stones known as obugh-a, where the
Mongols might make offerings of food or horsehair or alcoholic drinks.
The three types of lower genii were collectively known as the
jhalbaril-un ghurban. These were pacified with an offering of tea from
China or some strong ferment and in modern times, cigars (c.f. the
cheroot offerings made in the Drāviḍa country to comparable deities such
the horse-riding Mūtāl Rautan depicted like a medieval cavalryman in the
retinue of gods like Ārya). These lesser spirits are important in daily
life for ghost-magic to attack enemies, to avert accidents while
foraging on the steppe, and to protect an individual animal or child.
The lesser genii are more in line with ghost-lore from other parts of
the world. With appropriate agreements before their death for
pacification, otherwise inimical but notable persons might become
protector spirits, like Jamuqa in the Chingizid epic. The commoners who
lived a bad life upon death might become vengeful or resentful evil
spirits. These might need pacification with a lower grade shaman’s
assistance or could even be directed for causing harm on their enemies
in life and their families.

2: A “deer stone”-like enshrinement of an ancient
shaman](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/shamanstone1.png)

Some of the lord spirits often straddle the line between the tengri-s
and the genii. As we have noted previously, the most notable of these
are the Sülde associated with the yak or horse-hair standard known as
the tuq (c.f. the Indo-Aryan symbol of royalty the cāmara or yak-tail
whisks). Regarding these, in later tradition a peculiar tale, clearly
inspired by the ancient ārya brāhmaṇa narratives, is told: Qormusta Khan
Tengri instructed the other tengri regarding the Sülde when they were
defeated by the Asura-s. This custom brought them victory. From the
Chingizid times we know there were two distinct Sülde: the white one
(tsaghan), which was used to protect the camp in an apotropaic
deployment and the black one (qara), which was used to bring harm to the
enemies. That one was planted on the holy fire hearth of the enemy once
their camp was taken. Sometimes, an enemy might be sacrificed to the
Sülde; as of recently even bauddha ritualists sacrificed goats to some
venerated Sülde. It is not clear if the followers of the ekarākṣasa
cults who were sacrificed for refusing to bow before the Mongol divine
symbols were killed before a tuq for the Sülde or the lord spirits of
the Khans.

[Figure 3. A depiction of the qara and tsaghan tuq of Chingiz Khan at
the Mongolian Hall of
Ceremonies.](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/chingiz_khan1.png)

This latter point brings us to the worship the lord spirit of the Khans.
As noted by the Jewish chronicler, Rashīd al-Dīn, who was employed by
the Mongols in Iran, the lord spirits of the dead Chingizid Khans were
worshiped at the Yeke Qorig (the Great Forbidden Sanctuary) that is
believed to have been located in the Hentii mountain range. Here the
idols of the Khans received a continuous burning of incense sticks and
was restricted in access. Khan Kamala, the grandson of Quibilai built
the temple of the Chingizid lord spirits at Burqan Qaldun, which Igor de
Rachewiltz associates with ruins found on the bank of the Avarga river.
The Japanese researcher Shiraishi Noriyuki holds that the icons
mentioned by Rashīd al-Dīn and the site of Kamala’s temple were the same
as this Avarga river ruin. The Mongol chronicles explicitly mention that
the idol of Chingiz Khan had a golden quiver with real arrows in it.
Even the Manchu, during the Ching dynasty, still maintained a temple for
the youngest son of Chingis Khan, Tolui, at Ordos housing an idol of
his. These life-sized stone Mongol ongon icons for housing the lord
spirit follow in the long tradition of Altaic steppe peoples as seen in
the form of the stone images of the old Blue Turk and Uighur Khans and
lords. The Khitan Khans’s spirits were worshiped in golden idols.
Similarly, we have smaller metal idols among the Chingizid Mongols,
which some believe might have been for the worship of the lord spirits
of leaders of clans, like those of Boghorju, Muqali and Subedei.

During the initial bauddhization of the Mongols, ancestor worship of the
Mongols was brought into the maṇḍala-s of vajrayāna. One notable case is
the placement of the pictures of the Khans in the maṇḍala of the deity
Vajrabhairava. As we have noted before, since the Chingizid period the
lord spirit of Chingiz Khan and his prominent successors became national
deities. From lord spirits they were raised to a higher divine status,
who within the bauddha system was seen as a yakṣa associated with
Vaiśravaṇa — the great king in the Vedic tradition or as an incarnation
of Vajrapāṇi. One such incantation that worships him in his aspect as an
incarnation of the great yakṣarāṭ Mahārāja goes thus:

Chinggis Khan, who has the power of three thousand people  
His body was wrapped by the ten thousand white moon rays.  
He has one face, two arms, and three eyes.  
He was smiling wryly,  
Brandishing to the center of the sky a white spear in his right hand.  
In his left hand he was holding close to his heart a plate full of
treasures.  
He got rid of poverty in the samsara and nirvana.  
His white garment was fluttering in front of his chest.  
-translation by N. Hurcha from Inner Mongolia.

Some later Chingizid lord spirits also appear to receive prominent
worship in certain localities. One such as is Altan Khan, who famously
reunified the Mongols to defend them against the resurgent Han
belligerence under the Ming, and launched a raid on Beijing. The lord
spirits of him his and of some royal women of his family are worshiped
in large paintings. The spirits of Abtai Khan (A Chingizid lord of one
of the Khalkha Khanates) and his family were also actively worshiped
before their suppression by the Marxists. This was almost like karma
visiting him as he had actively suppressed the shamanic cults upon the
calling of the third Dalai Lama.

The Geser Khan epic (to be treated separately) and the work of the
Heissig, and more recently that of Elisabetta Chiodo and Ágnes Birtalan,
suggest that some lord spirits from a pre-Chingizid period have attained
deity or near deity status. Most notable of these is Dayan Degereki
(Deerh), who has survived the bauddha action and was even incorporated
into their framework. His enshrinement in a stone ongon icon with a
bronze casing is clearly mentioned in the litany used by the shamans
invoking him. What is notable is his opposition to both the founder of
the Mongol nation, Chingiz Khan and the later Dalai Lama. The latter is
rather understandable given the above-noted tension between the
tāthāgata-s and the shamans — [we had described this in an earlier
note](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/).
However, Dayan Deerh’s opposition to the great Khan hints that he might
have come from a clan that was subjugated by the Khan or his successors.
One possibility is that he originally belonged to the Oirats, given that
he is also worshiped by them. Indeed, the litany to him mentions that
after he was enshrined in a stone ongon at the Örgöö river, the warriors
of Chingiz Khan tried to smash his “his unruly, damned skull”
\[translation by Birtalan\] with their swords and scimitars. However,
their weapons were blunted, and they fled. Eventually, he is said to
have accepted the overlordship of Chingiz Khan and became a Sülde and a
wide-ranging protector of the Mongol people along with his son Saraitan
and daughter Saraimoo (who appears to be a reverse-euhemerized
Sarasvatī). Saraitan appears as a healing deity as indicated in the
incantation recited to him in a shamanic ecstasy:  
You protect every orphan,  
You enrich every poor man,  
Your knowledge is perfect,  
You have healing powers in your thumb,  
Your index finger heals,  
You know everything that is hidden,  
Saraitan, you are a healer  
To the seventieth generation.

Similarly, the incantation to Saraimoo invokes her vīṇā and seeks the
blessing of progeny:  
You put a curb on the reckless,  
With sounds of music on the strings of your lute,  
You show what the mountain hides,  
You grant fine offspring to all  
Who yearn for them.  
You, Saraimoo.  
\[translated from the Mongolian by Birtalan\]

In terms of iconography, Saraimoo is depicted exactly like Sarasvatī.
The iconography of Dayan Degereki closely parallels that of two other
martial deities Dayisun tengri and Dayichin tengri, who seem to have
been invoked along with the Qara Sülde while proceeding for a battle.
This raises the possibility that this complex of deities had
evolutionary connections linking them to the lord spirits to the
tengri-s. However, the exact processes involved remain unclear —
euhemerization versus its reverse. Among other things, Dayan Deerh’s key
pre-bauddha cultic stone image was destroyed by the Soviet-backed
Marxist terrorists during the ascendancy which poses impediments to our
current understanding.

We had a chat with with C Surendranath, Contributing Editor and (in part
with) Yogini Deshpande, Editor in Chief of Indic Today. It is divided
into four parts:  
1)
<https://www.indictoday.com/videos/manasataramgini-civilization-counter-religion-continuity-collapse-i/>  
A few clarifications for this part: 1) We do not as personally identify
“trad”, “alt-right” or whatever. However, Hindu, brāhmaṇa, Vaidika
smārta (with a degree of parallel adoption of tāntrika practice) are
part of our identity. 2) The name of the German philosopher Schopenhauer
was mysteriously blanked out twice! 3) We did say gulag but it sounds
like kulak. 4) The first German Jewish professor we were thinking about
was Moritz Stern, who succeeded Carl Gauss. Moritz Cantor also Jewish
was Stern’s student. Related to this part is our essay on [the
Lithuanian (Baltic) heathen
tradition](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/some-notes-on-the-heathen-lithuania-and-its-demise/).

2\)
<https://www.indictoday.com/conversations/manasataramgini-civilization-counter-religion-continuity-collapse-ii/>  
This part covers issues which we have presented in the writing here:
e.g. 1) Early “free-thinkers” in the
[Abrahamosphere](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/5030/)
(especially see second part). 2) Further details on the extra-military
aspects of the [Islamo-Hindu
confrontation](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/).
3) More focused discussion of aspects of [counter-religions and their
interactions](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/unmada-carca/).
4) Military labor entrepreneurship and related issues in the [last days
of the last Hindu
empire](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/).
5) Some Hindu polemics [against the
preta-mata](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/a-hindu-polemic-against-the-pretamata/).

3\)
<https://www.indictoday.com/conversations/manasataramgini-civilization-counter-religion-continuity-collapse-iii/>  
This part covers: 1) A basic introduction to legalism (fajia) & its
manifestations in old & recent Cīna thought. 2) Comparisons between the
imperial political frame in fajia and the arthaśāstra. 3) “Fads for
people” as a mechanism in legalism. 4) About half of Cīna history Hans
were ruled foreign powers: the consequences and responses. 5)
Counter-religions and Cīna responses: some comparisons with India. 6)
Hui and Cīna little brother of the preta and their suppression  
Overall you can take it prolegomenon for a H analysis of one of our
civilizational rivals. In the oral medium some little points can slip
through the cracks: We should have explicitly mentioned that eunuch
Zheng He was a Hui descending from those brought to Cīna by the Mongols.

4\)
<https://www.indictoday.com/conversations/manasataramgini-civilization-counter-religion-continuity-collapse-iv/>  
The final part of this chat covers the Rus. It meanders along touching
on: 1) the pagan Rus and their Christianization to the Orthodox church;
2) The Mongol conquest of the Rus. 3) The Rus fight back with Dimitri.
4) The see-saw struggle with Khan Toktamish burning Moscow. 5) Closer to
our age the attempt by the Rus to present themselves as the chief of the
preta world. 6) Exploration of the East – Siberia. 7) Conflicts with the
Western powers and Japan. 8) Marxian subversion of Russia. 9) WW2 and
the attack on Japan. 10) Rus as a Superpower. 11) Decline and
demographics. It is peppered with some other excursions and a discussion
on the movie on Alexander prince of Novgorod who fought the Germanic
invaders by Surendranath. We should have explicitly stated that he was a
feudatory of the Mongols and aided by Khan Sartaq of the Golden horde.

In our opinion the oral medium is best suited for a discursive
exploration of “big themes” along with interesting trivia as as raisins
in the pudding. It is not the best for “technical” or detail-oriented
presentations especially when not accompanied by other aids, like
figures and maps. This could compromise accuracy to a degree and also
the sequence in which events are treated. Hence, these should be heard
with those caveats in mind.

Seventeen years after [we first saw them
emerge](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/05/22/on-cicadas-and-their-kin/),
like a great horde of Cīna-s invading Tibet, the cicadas of Brood X
reemerged. 17 years is a good amount of time, making one pause to
reflect on what has passed by life, in addition to the cicada-s
themselves. This coming of Brood X was not very successful in our area.
We first started noticing them around May 17 and surveyed them in a 2 sq
km region that that we walk through by foot. They emerged alright after
their 17 year underground larval development at night from holes in the
ground. The 17- and 13-year cicadas seem to emerge after their fifth
instar molts.

[![Cicada_hole](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_hole.jpg?w=496&h=382)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_hole.jpg)

Most of them then proceeded to molt. However, right at this stage about
1/5-1/4 seemed die even as they are emerging from the molt. In the first
image below one can see a specimen that has died while molting. In the
second picture one see another such being scavenged by ants.

![Cicada_ants](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_ants.jpg?w=495&h=354)

After that, several underwent proper melanization but failed to properly
inflate their wings and died.

Those that did survive started their famed song.

![cicada_final](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_final.jpg?w=557&h=471)

This emergence was already a bit shaky relative to 17 years ago. From my
records they were already going well by May 22 of 2004. I examined about
100 or so and did not see any obvious signs of Massospora mycosis. It
was relatively cold for several days from May 17 onward (low \<15 C).
However, by May 21 the temperature was pretty good (low \>15) but they
still struggled and hardly any of their noise was heard as of May 23.
While our friend reported a similar situation in his site about 15 km
away from mine, others further away reported high densities at this
time. The cause their poor performance in our regions remains unclear.
Was it just the temperature or some other unknown pathogen or the
insecticide use by residents? We saw a couple moles scurrying around in
the twilight in one wooded area as also their predator a fast-running
fox. Moles are known predators of their larvae but we doubt they are
numerous enough to make a difference. In any case, much of the death
which we saw was post-emergence. The cicadas finally hit their stride
around June 2 and the wooded paths were reverberating with their
tymbals. All the noises — the choruses, females clicking the wings, the
coupling noises and the distress screeches as birds attacked them —
could be heard. On June 18 a precipitous decline in their calls was
noticed and they were gone by June 20. However, their final act was
registered in the wilting of tree shoots as the females slit the
terminal branches to lay their eggs.

[![cicada_eggs
(2)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_eggs-2.jpg?w=332&h=438)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/cicada_eggs-2.jpg)

Thus, it was just about a month of activity with a weak start and even
the peak afflicted by several days of heavy rains. How exactly this
would affect their prospects 17 years down the line remains unknown.
This brings us to hypotheses regarding the long periods of these
cicadas. Cicadas are unique among insects in having long lifespans, most
of which is spent in larval stages. A study in Ohio where there was an
unusually warm January followed by a freeze resulted in maple trees
producing two sets of new leaves in the same year; during that event the
17 year cicadas came out one year earlier once the late spring soil
temperatures stabilized at around 18 C (their preferred emergence
temperature). This suggests that they have a mechanism to track the
cycles of leafing in the trees whose sap they suck deep underground and
thus count the years. In this regard we propose a dendrochronological
exploration wherein tree ring records are examined to see if a
periodicity relating to cicada emergence can be discerned in them.

More broadly, several cicadas come out every year. However, there are
those, such as *Okanagana* in North America, which can have lifespans in
the range of 9 to 19 years. At least the 9-year ones exhibit a 9 year
“proto-periodic” cycle, where they are abundant in 4 of these years and
relatively rare or absent in 5 of them. This indicates a degree of
synchronization among the broods of the 9-year Okanaganas. One of the
Okanaganas from Canada, *Okanagana synodica*, and *Tettigades
“chilensis”* from Central Chile have 19-year life cycles and could very
well represent transition to the next highest prime number cycle beyond
17. The Japanese cicada, *Oncotympana coreana*, might have converged to
a shorter prime cycle of 7 years; there are several other Japanese
cicadas with even shorter 3-year cycles. There are also cicadas with 4-
or 8-year cycles from India, Japan, Fiji and Australia, most of which
are likely proto-periodicals with abundant years and rare years.
However, of these, the so-called “World Cup Cicada”, *Chremistica
ribhoi* from the Ri Bhoi District, Meghalaya, India, with a 4 year
cycle, and *Raiateana knowlesi* from Fiji with an 8 year cycle, appear
to be truly periodic with non-prime cycles.

One argument was that the relatively long prime cycles were selected to
evade predators and parasites that might take advantage of their
periodic emergences to coordinate their own generations to divisors of
the cicada cycle. But long primes could throw this off. However, the
alternative hypothesis has been that the long cycles are to evade
prolonged periods of harsh climate and that the prime cycles are likely
to throw off mating with cicadas with shorter periods that may be
divisors of the longer cycle. Thus, prolonged harsh climate would
segregate broods which do not mate with each other favor long prime
periods. However, the discovery of the even-period cicadas from India
and Fiji raise questions about these prime periodicity proposals and
suggests that prime periodicity is not hard and fast in cicadas.

Whatever the case, there is support for predation being a potential
selective pressure for synchronicity once a period longer than a couple
of years is established. It has been proposed that a mass, synchronous
emergence overwhelms the predators with satiation. There is some
evidence for this from field observations. We have ourselves noted that
while the initial emergents are eaten by dinosaurian and mammalian
predators, they are quickly overwhelmed by the huge numbers in the case
of the prime periodic cicadas. More recent observations, that need
further study, indicate that once they establish a high intensity
chorus, they inhibit birds by driving them away from the areas with high
levels of noise. This has been observed with both tropical cicadas in
Central America and 17-year periodic cicadas in the USA. Very loud
cicadas are seen all over the world and their noise can be damaging to
mammalian ears, like those of humans, at close range. Hence, the
synchronous emergence with a chorus likely to be adaptive against
predators irrespective of the period.

However, for this strategy to evolve first a relatively long life has to
be in place. Most insects have annual cycles and several cicadas are no
different. Hence, this was likely the ancestral condition from which
early on a long-lived version emerged. The origin of such a long-lived
version could have been selected by harsh climate because by skipping an
year or two before emergence they could tide over period of drought or
cold. It is conceivable that it first arose close to the tropics in
response to drought and it allowed colonization of higher latitudes as
it provide a means of tiding over cold. Per say, climatically driven
selection for long life is unlikely to favor synchronicity because by
hedging bets and distributing the emergence one is more likely to get a
good year eventually. We see the longer periods to be more common in
higher latitudes like Japan, New Zealand and North America suggesting
that cold weather might have been a selective pressure for increasing
the length of life cycle. Once long life was selected, it is likely that
a degree of synchronicity was selected next by predator pressure. It is
possible that this happened several times independently in different
parts of the world giving rise to the several proto-periodic cicadas and
that the transition to long periodic cycles was likely via
synchronization of the proto-periodic intermediates. Yet, it seems to us
that we don’t still have the strongest or cleanest hypothesis for the
emergence of prime periods.

A cycle of 17 years is a big span even in human reckoning. Hence, we
could not avoid looking back at the ebb and flow of life in the 17 years
since the last emergence. One thing has ironically remained the same
both at this emergence and that last. However, when we looked at that
thing during the last emergence, we were still quite hopeful. Having
seen a lot of life, we are inherently pessimistic about things that need
near miracles, but at that time we were still hopeful of victory in the
battle of the blind-spots — one where we had to shoot the target without
being able to see it. That conquest remains as elusive now as 17 years
back. In those 17 years, we did see some glimmer of the hiding foe but
whatever we saw inspired no confidence whatsoever that we could beat it.
A strange thing happened somewhere roughly midway in those 17 years
though. Tied down by the lassos of Varuṇa and the darts of Rudra, we
knew not at some point how long we may trudge on. It looked like the
climb of Himalayan slope while being low on supplies. At that point,
like at few other points in our life, we took a big but carefully
calculated gamble. There are some such junctures when the probabilities
can be relatively precisely computed, and you can make an “informed”
bet. However, this bet was rather different from the rest in that we
made it in a niṣkāmya manner — one where we had properly steeled
ourselves for the negative outcome. There we were in a three-front war
but only two of them mattered at all. The gods aided this time, unlike
at the time shortly after the last emergence, and we scored several
outright victories on both those fronts — like the Aśvin-s and Indra
aiding emperor Trasadasyu in the demolition of forts. But that third
front was a mysterious experience. We neither won nor lost. However, we
got a fairly clear glimpse, late one evening, of what true victory in
that front would look like. We had started doubting if there was even
such possibility — maybe it was just a figment of our imagination — the
quest for something that did not exist in real life. That glimpse showed
that it was real; we were not chasing a gandharva-nagara — we could
almost get there — but the chance that we would rule over that city was
perhaps not going to come. Such are the ways of the gods — they
sometimes show you after a long trial that something you thought should
exist really exists, but it might indeed be out of reach, like a man
yearning to reach a planet going around another star.

In the 17 years that have gone by the gods took us to many deserved
victories against powerful foes — indeed, the wielder of the thunderbolt
raises the Ārya yajamāna against the dasyu. At some point in the last
third of those years we made another calculated gamble. We were in a
position of relative power and we knew that if we did not make it our
enemies would gain a complete advantage. A lot more depended on our
allies than on us in that samarya. Our allies tried their best, fighting
to the utmost of their abilities, but they lost, and our enemies made
away with all their riches. We ourselves won most individual battles,
barring one where we were betrayed by expectedly flaky fellow travelers.
But the advantage our foes had gained and the flagging morale of our
pakṣa placed us at the foot of yet another mountain fortress that seems
formidable as that of emperor Jarāsaṃdha of Magadha. Time will tell if
we might be able raise an army that will accompany us in new campaigns
at a time when the physical virus from China and the mental one with
ultimate roots in West Asia has widened the gulf between winners and
losers.

Like the clouds lifting after the monsoonal deluge to unveil the
short-lived comforts of early autumn, the metaphorical pall over the
nation cast by the [engineer’s
virus](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/the-engineer-the-dead-fish-and-the-bag-of-earth/)
was lifting. Somakhya and Lootika were at the former’s parents’ house,
relieved that they had survived and overcome the tumultuous events.
Somakhya’s parents asked them to offer the Varuṇāvasiṣṇava and
associated oblations as ordained by the Bhṛgu-s and Āṅgirasa-s of yore.
Vrishchika and Indrasena were also present as observers of the rite.
Somakhya donned his turban and identified himself with the god Indra to
initiate the rite, for indeed the śruti has said: tad vā etad atharvaṇo
rūpaṃ yad uṣṇīṣī brahmā । — that brāhmaṇa who is turbaned is indeed of
the form of the Atharvan. He explained to Indrasena that the śruti holds
the Indra took the shape of the Atharvaveda in his turbaned form to
protect the ritual of the gods from the dānava-s. Indrasena: “Indeed,
even the primordial śruti records that form of Indra in the ṛk of the
Kāṇva-s:

yajña indram avardhayad yad bhūmiṃ vy avartayat । cakrāṇa opaśaṃ divi
॥  
The ritual magnified Indra \[with praise\] when he made the earth
rotate, making \[himself\] a turban in (= of) heaven.  
One may note play on the word opaśa; by taking it as neuter one could
also interpret is as the pillar or the axis of heaven.”

Then, Somakhya and Lootika took their seat before the fire on the hide
of a reddish brown ox strewn with darbha grass. Thereafter, they
performed an ācamana and prokṣaṇa with the incantations: apāṃ puṣpaṃ
mūrtir ākāśaṃ pavitram uttamam । indra jīva sūrya jīva devā jīvā
jīvyāsam aham । sarvam āyur jīvyāsam ॥ \[The flower is the form of the
waters, the empty space \[and\] that which the most pure. Enliven, o
Indra; Enliven o Sūrya. Enliven, o gods. May I live. May I complete my
term of life\].

Thereafter, Somakhya meditated on the special connection of the founder
of his race to god Varuṇa and uttered the incantation establishing his
connection to the founder of his lineage, great Bhṛgu: tad bhṛgor
bhṛgutvam। bhṛgur iva vai sa sarveṣu lokeṣu bhāti ya evaṃ veda ॥ \[That
\[connection with Varuṇa\] is the Bhṛgu-ness of Bhṛgu. He who knows thus
shines in all the worlds like Bhṛgu\]. He recited the formula: OṂ
sarvair etair atharvabhiś cātharvaṇaiś ca kurvīya॥ \[OṂ May I perform
\[this rite\] by means of all these incantations of Atharvan and the
Ātharvaṇa-s\]. OṂ mantrāś ca mām abhimukhībhaveyuḥ । \[OṂ may the \[AV\]
mantra-s face me \[favorably\]\]. Somakhya then explained to Indrasena
and Vrishchika: “The śruti holds that like a mother can be killed by the
fetus she bears, the mantra-s can kill the holder if he improperly
applied them or has not been diligent in their study. Hence, he must
utter this incantation beginning with OṂ. The praṇava indeed protects
him from such backfiring.”

He muttered the Sāvitra incantation-s to the god Savitṛ as per the
teaching of the great brāhmaṇa Śvetaketu, the son of Uddākaka Āruṇi:  
OṂ BHUR BHUVAḤ SVAḤ tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: This first cycle is done
with the 3 mahāvyāhṛti-s.  
OṂ BHŪR JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya touched Lootika with
a darbha-bunch and she made an oblation as is appropriate for the
sacrificer’s wife in the fire at the utterance of svāhā (idaṃ na mama
॥)  
OṂ BHUVO JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya’s parents stepped
forward and made an offering with a silent svadhā call and touched
water.  
OṂ SVAR JANAT tat savitur… prachodayāt ॥: Somakhya made an oblation with
a svāhā (idaṃ na mama ॥)  
OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD OM tat savitur… paro rajase ‘sāvado3m॥:
Somakhya made an oblation with a vauṣaṭ uttered loudly (idaṃ na mama ॥)

Then he proceeded to the main oblations:  
śrauṣaḍ  
yayor ojasā skabhitā rajāṃsi  
yau vīryair vīratamā śaviṣṭhā ।  
yau patyete apratītau sahobhir

By whose power the domains of space were stabilized,  
by whose energy, the most energetic and mightiest,  
who lord it unopposed by their powers,  
to \[that\] Viṣṇu and Varuṇa have gone the first offerings.

yasyedaṃ pradiśi yad virocate  
pra cānati vi ca caṣṭe śacībhiḥ ।  
purā devasya dharmaṇā sahobhir  
viṣṇum agan varuṇaṃ pūrvahūtiḥ ॥  
vauṣaṭ + idaṃ varuṇāviṣṇūbhyāṃ na mama ॥

In whose direction is that which shines forth,  
\[whatever\] that vibrates and observes with power  
from ancient times by the god’s law with might,  
to \[that\] Viṣṇu and Varuṇa have gone the first offerings.

OṂ BHŪH pra tad viṣṇu stavate vīryāṇi

OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OṂ viṣṇave

Thus, he praises forth his heroic deeds, Viṣṇu is  
like a dreadful lion wandering, stationed in the mountains  
From the distant realm may he come close.

śrauṣaḍ

O Agni and Viṣṇu mighty is your might;  
you two drink from name of the ghee’s secret.  
In home after home you two place the seven gems.  
may your tongue move here to meet the ghee.

O Agni and Viṣṇu mighty is your dear domain;  
may you two savor the secret enjoyment of the ghee  
In home after home you two are magnified by good praise-chants.  
may your tongue flicker upward to meet the ghee.

OṂ BHŪH yasyoruṣu triṣu vikramaneṣv adhikṣiyanti bhuvanāni viśvā ।

In whose wide three strides all the worlds are laid down;  
stride widely O Viṣṇu for wide lordship; make \[that lordship\] for
us;  
Drink the ghee, O source of ghee; prolong the lord of the ritual over
and over!

May all the gods be at my ritual invocation;  
The Marut-s with Indra, Viṣṇu and Agni.  
Let the broad realm of the atmosphere be mine.  
May Vāta blow for favoring this wish of mine.

Whether one of ours or one who is in a truce, a kinsman or an alien,
whosoever attacks us  
may Rudra releasing a shower of arrows pierce those enemies of mine.

Whichever competitor or whichever non-competitor and whichever hater

the gods shall injure him. The incantation is my inner armor.

Having concluded the after-rites Somakhya, Lootika, Indrasena and
Vrischika left to savor the fresh air and the natural world, and engage
in some brahmavāda on the hills beyond the late medieval temple of the
awful Caṇḍikā. They stopped at the quadrangle in the low ground facing
the stairs leading to the temple on the hill before a towering bastard
poon tree. Vrishchika: “There used to be an old woman with a goat who
used sit in the vicinity of this skunk tree. We used to feed her goat as
a representative of the god Kumāra. She has likely passed into the realm
of Vivasvān’s son along with her aja. Hope Rudra was kind to her when
her time came. Indrasena, sometimes, thinking about you, as though
seized by Skanda or Viṣṇu, I used to feed her goat hoping that Skanda
might be kind to me.” Indrasena: “O Gautamī, after all the meanderings,
it seems, Skanda has brought you to your destination as he did to the
Kāṇva and his goat.” Lootika: “I also recall that Somakhya’s family
observes a Kaumāra rite on the Āśvina fullmoon, where they make a rare
dish from payasya (curdled milk cheese; Iranic: paynīr). They would
offer some of that to the woman with the goat getting the leaf in which
the dish was wrapped” Indrasena: “Is that a folk Atharvan rite?”.
Somakhya: “Yes, the folk Atharvan tradition holds that Skanda is the
teacher of Paippalāda, one of the promulgators of the AV saṃhita-s, and
the paurṇamāsya rite is held in the honor of the enlightenment of
Paippalāda.”

It was a quiet time of the day with just a light stream of votaries and
gawkers on the stairway to the temple. The four made their way up the
steps, mostly in silent thought, to pay their respects to the enshrined
parivāra-devatā-s and the wife of Rudra at the main shrine. Even as they
were about to exit the circumambulatory path to resume their climb
beyond the stair way further up the crag to the plateau beyond, Lootika
was approached by a woman who wanted to fall at her feet. Lootika
prevented her from doing so and she began pouring out a litany of
medical troubles. Lootika signaled to her sister: “This lady seems to
have mistaken me to be you.” Vrishchika: “Stepped in and having briefly
heard her out gave her some reassuring words and asked her to attend to
her father’s clinic.” Somakhya and Indrasena instinctively felt their
concealed guns and knives for a dasyu could always be lurking in the
shades. Having reached their favored vantage point, the site of an old
megalithic stone circle, they looked on at their city below. There
seemed to be some hesitancy in returning to the old normal; hence, the
air seemed cleaner and the horizon clearer. The, nakṣatra of the day,
the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, had mounted the vault of the cloudless
southern sky. Looking into the distance they saw that the fires in the
yonder cemetery were far fewer than when Somakhya and Lootika had looked
on from the same place during the height of the conflict. Lootika: “The
lull between the storms.” Vrishchika: “You think it is not yet over?” L:
“The clash with the rākṣasa-mata-s is like the fight between the
Daitya-s and the Deva-s — the bigger disease from the mleccha-s is that
of the mind — it will play out next with much spilling of blood — but
then our people could end in a whisper too.”

Indrasena: “Coming to the rite of morning, I’d like understand more
about the AV vyāhṛti-s — both the combination of the mahāvyāhṛtis with
the incantations as also the connection of the vyāhṛti-s to Maruta
Indravantaḥ.”  
Vrishchika: “Could we please also have a broader discussion of role the
mahāvyāhṛti-s and their transcendence by other vyāhṛti-s across the
Vaidika collections?”

Somakhya: “Alright, Vrishchika, let us lay the groundwork for the
exploration desired by Indrasena by first addressing the brahmavāda on
the vyāhṛti-s in the śruti-s other than those of the Atharvan-s. Let us
begin this discussion with testing your knowledge of the traditions
regarding the vyāhṛti-s in the traditions you are familiar with. Why
don’t you tell us what you know regarding the three mahā-vyāhṛti-s?”  
V: “The śruti of the Aitareya-s holds that the 3 vyāhṛti-s are like
connective tissue that holds together the three disjunct parts of the
śruti in the form of the ṛk-s, yajuṣ-es and sāman-s — thus they are
compared to procedures akin to reducing dislocations of joints or sewing
up cut skin. Indeed, this analogy of the Aitareya-s provides early
evidence for these medical procedures among the ārya-s, which parallel
those surgical and bone-setting procedures explicitly mentioned in the
Veda of the Atharvan-s and having echoes among other Indo-Europeans,
like in the Merseburg spell of the śūlapuruṣa-s:  
(bhūr bhuvaḥ svar) … etāni ha vai vedānām antaḥ śleṣaṇāni yad etā
vyāhṛtayas . tad yathātmanātmānaṃ saṃdadhyād . yathā parvaṇā parva yathā
śleṣmaṇā carmaṇyaṃ vānyad vā viśliṣṭam saṃśleṣayed । evam evaitābhir
yajṅasya viśliṣṭaṃ saṃdadhāti ॥

These are verily the internal bindings of the Veda-s, these vyāhṛti-s.
Even as one joins the one individual thing other separated thing; like
setting one joint with another joint; like suturing with a cord, skin
with another torn one. Even so, verily with these one joins the disjunct
parts of the the ritual.

Thus, the suturing role of the vyāhṛti-s is critical for the terminal
sviṣṭakṛt-s for fixing the errors in the ritual.

S: “That is good. So, what do you know of the thesis of the
transcendence of 3 mahāvyāhṛti-s?”  
V: “Well, the Upaniṣat of the Taittirīyaka-s holds that there are three
primal or mahāvyāhṛti-s, bhūr, bhuvas and suvar; however, the sage
Māhācamasya held that there is a fourth, i.e. mahas. In his teaching
mahas is privileged over the remaining three. He establishes four
homologies between them and other entities. Those are the following: 1)
He sees the three primary one bhūr, bhuvas and suvar as corresponding to
the earth, the atmosphere and the space beyond. The fourth, mahas, is
seen as the Āditya, the sun, which causes the world material worlds to
take form — perhaps in more than one way — by supplying the matter to
make them and also the light by which their existence is perceived. 2)
The next homology is to the first 3 and the sources of light — the fire,
the wind (he implies lightning here) and the sun. The reflected light of
the moon is homologized to mahas — here again we might see it as the
ambient light that makes perception possible even the source themselves
are invisible. 3) He also homologizes the first 3 with the 3 categories
of incantations in the śruti, the ṛk-s, the yajuṣ-es and the sāman-s,
and mahas with the brahman, which is to be understood here as the
praṇava. 4) The next homology is between the vyāhṛti-s and the
inhalation, exhalation, and retention in the prāṇāyāma cycle.
Specifically, in that context mahas may be understood as the air.
However, I hold that from the śruti we may infer that what was meant was
more general — the physiological process of nutrient uptake, export of
unwanted and secreted compounds and the anabolic processes. The
free-energy-providing material in this process, i.e. the nutrients, is
the fourth, mahas. Thus, as there are four homologies in each set with a
total of 4 sets, the vyahṛti-s are seen as being 16-fold. The summary of
these linkages is presented as the understanding that the first three
are the limbs of the physical body and mahas corresponds to the
consciousness. Thus, mahas in different domains is equated respectively
with the link substance, the work-generating substance, the diffuse or
reflected light that pervades the universe and the mantra essence — all
of these are seen as analogies for the nature of consciousness with
respect to matter.”

Somakhya: “Excellent upa-gautamī. Dear Lootika is there something you
might want to add to what your sister has just expounded from other
Vedic traditions?”  
Lootika: “Sure. I actually learnt of the multiple expressions of
vyāhṛtyutpatti in the scriptural readings I did with your mother. This
theory of Māhācamasya, introducing the fourth vyāhṛti perhaps led up to
the theory of multiple vyāhṛti-s in both Atharvan and Yajuṣ traditions.
This is clearly a departure from the triple vyāhṛti system expounded in
the brāhmaṇa of the Vājasaneyin-s, that of the Aitareya-s and the
Upaniṣad brāhmaṇa of the Jaimini singers. There explicitly Prajāpati is
described as generating only 3 vyāhṛti-s.”

Indrasena: “Indeed. However, each of those accounts have notable points
— one may see a gradual build up of concepts within the 3 vyāhṛti system
that led to the emergence of the fourth. In the śruti of the
Vājasaneyin-s, we have an account that might be seen as retaining the
archaic form which the thesis of Māhācamasya eventually emerged. That
account describes the heat (tapas) of Prajāpati as the basis for the
emanation of the 3 worlds. Since these worlds were heated by his tapas
they emanated the same 3 primary sources of light (the deities Agni,
Vāyu and Āditya) mentioned by the TU. That tapas causing those lights to
radiate heat spawned the collections of the 3 types of mantra-s of the
śruti. His tapas then caused those mantra collections to radiate heat
from which Prajāpati extracted three generative substances (śukra-s)
that are the vyāhṛti-s. We might trace the origins of the two other
traditions, which Lootika just mentioned, from such a foundation — one
present in the Sāmavaidika tradition of the Jaiminīya-s and the other in
the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa.

In the former, Prajāpati is not presented in a protogonic context, but
is competing with the other gods, probably reflecting the tension
between the surging Prājāpatya religion among our people and the older
Ārya-deva-dharma. Prajāpati conquered the triple-world with the 3-fold
mantra collection. Fearing that the other gods might see the same and
take over his conquest, he extracted the essence of the ṛk-s uttering
bhūḥ. That became the earth and its essence streamed forth as Agni. From
the Yajuṣ-es he extracted the essence with bhuvaḥ and that formed the
atmosphere and streamed forth as Vāyu. The sāman-s were distilled with
the suvaḥ call and they formed the the heaven, from which the essence
streamed forth as the Āditya. However, there was one akṣara he could not
distill into an essence, namely the praṇava. That remained by itself and
became Vāc.

In the Aitareya text, we have a cosmogony closer to that the of
Vājasaneyin-s, wherein Prajāpati’s heat generated the triple-world. As
in the former account, by his heating of those, the 3 luminaries emerged
and by heating those the 3 mantra-s collection were generated. By
heating those again the generative essences (śukra-s), which are the 3
primary vyāhṛti-s emerged. But in this account those were heated further
to generate 3 phonemes: A, U, M, which Prajāpati got together to
generate the praṇava, OṂ. Thus, here too, as in the
Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-brāhmaṇa we see that there is something beyond the 3
basic vyāhṛti-s, namely the praṇava. It is the praṇava that Māhācamasya
equated to the fourth vyāhṛti mahas in his thesis and that which appears
as the final vyāhṛti of the Atharvan-s. Thus, we see an evolutionary
process within the śruti which paved the way for the vyāhṛti-s beyond
the primary three via the concept of the praṇava.”

Lootika: “There is no mention of the triple vyāhṛiti-s in the oldest
layer of our tradition, the Ṛk-saṃhitā. Now, that could be because they
are specialized calls that don’t fit into the metrical incantations.
However, in all the accounts of vyāhṛtyutpatti, which we have discussed
so far, we see the central role of the protogonic god Prajāpati. Is that
the vyāhṛiti incantations arose within a Prājāpatya milieu? As Indrasena
pointed out, one of the narratives might hint at Prajāpati competing
with the gods of the old religion. Moreover, in specifying the deities
of the vyāhṛiti-s, Śaunaka mentions in the Bṛhaddevatā that, whereas
Prajāpati is the god of all the 3 vyāhṛti-s as a group, individually
they have Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya as their deities. Likewise, for OṂ,
Śaunaka mentions Vāc and Ka Prajāpati as in the brāhmaṇa narratives, but
also Indra and the gods in general as its deity. This is indeed
supported by the fundamental teaching of the upaniṣat:

yaś chandasām ṛṣabho viśvarūpaś  
chandobhyaś candām̐sy āviveśa ।  
satām̐ śikyaḥ provācopaniṣadindro  
jyeṣṭha indriyāya ṛṣibhyo  
namo devebhyaḥ svadhā pitṛbhyo  
bhūr bhuvaḥ suvaś chanda om ॥

After all even in its declining days our tradition was quite unanimous
about this teaching and held that: “sa praṇava-svarūpī
paramaiśvarya-yukta paramātmā indra upaniṣat pratipādyo bhūtva
vyāhṛti-trayātmā oṃkāraḥ ।” Indra, in the form of the vyāhṛti-s and the
praṇava, is indeed is the first causal link in the “bringing together”
(upaniṣat) of the sambandha-s for our ancestors — fitting well with the
Aitareya statement on the vyāhṛti as the internal bonds of the śruti.
These hint at a pre-Prājāpatya origin for the vyāhṛti-s and the praṇava
within the old religion. So, can we find evidence for the ritual
deployment of the vyāhṛti-s in the pre-Prājāpatya layer of the
religion?”

S: “A superficial student could indeed reach the conclusion that the
vyāhṛiti-concept emerged as part of the linking of the cosmogonic role
of Prajāpati with the cosmic origin of the mantra-s, like in the
accounts that Indrasena just expounded. However, as your sister noted
there is an association of the vyāhṛti-s with the sviṣṭakṛt rite for
setting right the errors of ritual. Indeed, as you know well, such
vyāhṛti oblations and calls are a general feature of most gṛhya rites
and also śrauta rituals such the sāmidhenī incantations where they make
up the syllables corresponding to the rest of the year beyond the 365. I
would say this pervasive use is an indication of their ancient and
pre-Prājāpatya ritual roles, substantiating their conception as the
internal fastenings of the Veda. An unambiguous case for their
pre-Prājāpatya role is made by their central role in the silent
incantations that are inaudibly recited as as part of various śastra-s,
as also the similar incantations used in the morning and evening
offerings of the Agnihotra. Thus, the śruti of the Aitareya-s states
that one concludes the Ājya and Praüga recitation with bhūr agnir jyotir
jyotir agniḥ ॥; the Niṣkevalya and Marutvatīya recitations with indro
jyotir bhuvo jyotir indraḥ ॥ and the Āgnimāruta and Vaiśvadeva
recitations with sūryo jyotir jyotiḥ svaḥ sūryaḥ ॥ as the inaudible
incantations. This give us a glimpse of their ancient use in a śrauta
context going back to pre-Prājāpatya times. But we see pervasive signs
of their place in even more routine rites that reinforce the proposal
that their common place use was of pre-Prājāpatya provenance — I guess
you might agree Indrasena?”

I: “I was just about to interject in this regard. To build up the
context, we may first note the Vyāhṛti-kalpa from the gṛhya appendix of
the Bodhāyana-s, which teaches the 12000x japa of the mahāvyāhṛti-s for
the attainment of specific goals and purification. It was this tradition
of the japa of the vyāhṛti-s that one hand was incorporated into nitya
and naimittika rituals focused on Deva Savitṛ — like the very fact that
we use either the three mahāvyāhṛti-s or the seven vyāhṛti-s: BHUḤ
BHUVAḤ SUVAḤ MAHAḤ JANAḤ TAPAḤ SATYAM coupled the Sāvitrī in our routine
daily japa. The same applies to the coupling of the mahāvyāhṛti-s with
the Sāvitrī and the Trisuparṇa in the mahat (the great) rite taught by
Uddālaka Āruṇi to Yājñvalkya Vājasaneya, the founders of the śukla
tradition. Indeed, this coupling of the mahāvyāhṛti-s with the Sāvitrī
is extended in tradition of the Jaiminīya singers, wherein two
additional vyāhṛti-s are added to the list to make it a total of five,
just as the seven in the other traditions. These are SATYAM and PURUṢA,
after which comes the gāyatra sāman composed on the Sāvitrī. On the
other hand the pure mahā-vyāhṛti japa also developed into the song of
vyāhṛti-s in the tradition of the Rāṇāyanīya and Kauthuma singers. In
that song, the musically rendered vyāhṛti-s are sandwiched between two
musical praṇava-s and interspersed with 3 repetitions of the magical
stobha-s with the concluding bhakti-s of the suvar-jyotiḥ, reminiscent
of both the śastra incantation you mentioned and the brahmaśiras that
closes the Sāvitrī with the ten praṇava-s (OṂ BHUḤ । OṂ BHUVAḤ । OM̐
SUVAḤ । OṂ MAHAḤ । OṂ JANAḤ । OṂ TAPAḤ। OM̐ SATYAM । OṂ tat savitur
vareṇyam । bhargo devasya dhimahi । dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt ॥ OM āpo
jyotī raso amṛtam brahma BHŪR-BHUVA-SVAROM ॥). Similar to this
connection to the Sāvitrī, the vyāhṛti-s are also incorporated into the
important vyāhṛti-homa-s of the Yajuṣ tradition (bhūr annam agnaye
svāhā… ityādi) which culminate in the incantation of Indra as the bull
among the meters that your wife just mentioned. Notably, the last of the
vyāhṛti-homa incantations include the fourth vyāhṛti, mahas. All these
not only indicate the pervasive presence of the mahāvyāhṛti-s but also
the other vyāhṛti-s in a range of prayoga-s, like say the offerings to
Mahārāja in the Āraṇyaka of the Taittirīyaka-s. These strongly favor the
idea that the Prājāpatya-s were merely incorporating a widely use
mantra-tradition into their philosophizing.”

S: “Good. In this regard I would note that the special vyāhṛti, PURUṢA,
of the singers is also used in other recitations. One such is during the
expiatory singing of the Vāmadevya Stotra based on RV 4.31.1-3 composed
by the illustrious ancestor of our wives. The last of these ṛk-s is
short by 3 syllables from the gāyatrī; hence, he should insert the the 3
syllables of the vyāhṛti PURUṢA and recite this ṛk as a proper gāyatrī
before the Vāmadevya Stotra is sung. Thus, we have:  
OṂ abhī ṣu ṇaḥ sakhīnām PU avitā jaritṝṇāṃ RU । śatam bhavāsy ūtibhiḥ
ṢAḤ ॥

Similarly, during the recitation of the Rājana incantation in the
nocturnal ritual of the winter solstice we insert a PURUṢA into the
intertwining of the ṛk of my ancient clansman Bṛhaddiva Ātharvaṇa and
that of Priyamedha Āṅgirasa:  
tad id āsa bhuvaneṣu jyeṣṭham PU  
nadaṃ va odatīnāṃ \|  
yato jajña ugras tveṣanṛmṇo RU  
nadaṃ yoyuvatīno3m ।  
sadyo jajñāno ni riṇāti śatrūn  
patiṃ vo aghnyānāṃ \|  
anu yaṃ viśve madanty ūmāḥ ṢO  
dhenūnām iṣudhyaso3m ॥

Bṛhaddiva Ātharvaṇa:  
He indeed was the foremost in the universes,  
who was born with fierce, mighty manliness  
Simultaneously, with his birth, he melts down the enemies  
as all his friends \[Viṣṇu, Vāyu and the Marut-s\] cheer him on.

Priyamedha Āṅgirasa:  
At the roaring bull among the eager females,  
at the roaring bull among the coy young ladies,  
at the lord of your milk-giving cows,  
shoot your arrow \[in the form of the chant\]

As you can see, the intertwining couples a mantra indicating the
manliness of Indra with one indicating him as the bull among the
females; thus, the vyāhṛti PURUṢA here becomes the seed that is infused
into the incantation.”

I: “Somakhya, having gone so far into the realm of the vyāhṛti-s and
their prayoga-s, let us return to my original question regarding the
roots of the vyāhṛti-s of the Atharvan-s. Where all are they found and
what are their prayoga-s?”  
S: “Prājāpatya brahmavāda for the AV vyāhṛti-s given in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa is closely but briefly paralleled by the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
which states that the local worlds was generated in fluid from the three
mahāvyāhṛti-s. In contrast, the higher realms of space are said to have
been generated from vyāhṛti-s KARAT, JANAT, VṚDHAT and SATYAM. This
indicates that there was a wider knowledge and tradition of most of the
AV vyāhṛti-s. In terms of ritual, we can see from the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
itself that the prayoga is in the context of the older Aindra religion,
in the offering to the Marut-s and other deities who are in the company
of Indra (the Indravant-s). Even as the vyāhṛti PURUṢA is deployed
within the incantations that we just discussed, one could make a case
for a similar wider presence for most of the AV vyāhṛti-s. You noted the
emergence of equivalents of MAHAT and JANAD among other vaidika
traditions. To that I would add the use other AV vyāhṛti-s in various
traditions. For instance, the Vārāha-gṛhya-sūtra of the Maitrāyaṇīya-s
specifies the use of the triad karat, janat and bṛhat (unique to that
tradition, and semantically mirroring mahat or mahat) in the Garbhadhāna
ritual. Coming to the Taittirīyaka-s, we have Iḍa recitations laid down
by my ancestor Jamadagni Bhārgava for the drawing of the milk offerings
in the Agnihotra as taught by Āpastamba: BHŪR IḌĀ BHUVA IDĀ SUVAR IḌĀ
KARAD IḌĀ PṚTHIG IḌĀ ॥ In this tradition, the first three mahāvyāhṛti-s
are, as usual, associated with the Agni on earth, Vāyu in the atmosphere
and Sūrya in the heavens. Of the two further vyāhṛti-s, karat, matching
the AV tradition, corresponds to the moon moving against the backdrop of
the nakṣatra-s and the YV-specific PṚTHIK corresponding to the medicinal
herbs discovered by Jamadagni Bhārgava. The Āśvalāyana-s have only four
drawings of milk, and use vṛdhat instead of karat, again matching one
the AV vyāhṛti-s. Interestingly, the Maitrāyaṇīya-s instead use janat in
this context. Thus, these vyāhṛti-s are individually used in the other
traditions but come together as a whole in the AV tradition and the
svāhā offerings with them are specified in the Kauśika-sūtra-s.

This brings us to TAT and ŚAM. I’d posit that those arose from the
ancient opening of the Śamyuvāka incantation which is repeatedly
mentioned throughout the śruti. Its ancient use is suggested by opening
of the Śamyuvāka being sought from Rudra in the ṛk of Kaṇva, the son of
Ghora Aṅgirasa in the RV. In regard to TAT, one might also note that it
might have a link to its use in the Yajuṣ incantation of the supreme
Vāyu: OṂ tad brahma । OṂ tad vāyuḥ । OṂ tad ātmā । OṂ tat satyam । OṂ
tat sarvam । OṂ tat puror namaḥ ॥ Finally, coming to the praṇava as an
AV vyāhṛti, it seems to be a natural inclusion given the intimate link
the mahāvyāhṛti-s share with it mīmāṃsā and prayoga. We see that, for
example, in the Upaniṣat statement that identifies them with Indra as
the bull among the Chandas, which Lootika just mentioned. Finally, I
should also mention one of the homologies that the Atharvan tradition
recognizes between these vyāhṛti-s and the wider horizon of texts. Thus,
it has janat as equivalent to the compilation of the Āṅgirasa-s — the
Āṅgirasa-veda; similarly we have vṛdhat and Sarpaveda, karat and
Piśāchaveda, ruhat and Asuraveda, mahat and the Itihāsa-s, and tat and
the Purāṇa-s. This perhaps reflects both the growing corpus of texts and
awareness of texts of other traditions — like the Asuraveda — it could
be some kind of memory of the Iranian texts.”

V: “What are some of the meditations one should be mindful of when
performing a japa or contemplation on the progression of vyāhṛti-s?”  
I: “The most important one is the japa of the threefold mahāvyāhṛti-s
preceded by a praṇava. During this, as in the Vaiśvadeva songs of the
Chandoga-s, one meditates on the Vasu-s associating them with BHUR; them
one meditates on the Rudra-s associating them with the utterance of
BHUVAS; then one mediates on the Āditya-s while uttering SUVAR. With the
preceding OṂ, one meditates on Indra or Viśvedeva-s, i.e. the entire
pantheon. While moving from one mahāvyāhṛti to another one perceives the
connector deities: SUVAR and BHUḤ are connected by Dyāvā-Pṛthivī; BHUR
and BHUVAS by Agnī-ṣomā; BHUVAS and SUVAR by Vātā-Parjanyā. When
uttering the five vyāhṛti-s, i.e., mahāvyāhṛti-s + TAPAS and SATYAM one
additionally meditates on the primal heat from which all arose and the
very nature of existence. May be Somakhya could add more while returning
to our starting point of the AV vyāhṛti-s?”

L: “Also, before rounding up this discussion it would be worthwhile if
you could touch upon some of the mīmāṃsā-s on the different sets of
vyāhṛti-s that are not widely aired by the extant brahmavādin-s focused
on Prājāpatya and Uttaramīmāṃsā traditions.”  
S: “Sure. Their connection to the Sāvitrī and the god Savitṛ is the most
apparent one. The śruti holds that the inviolable laws of Savitṛ, like
the probabilities of the draws of the vibhīdaka nuts from the hole, are
the ones which run the universe: deva iva savitā satyadharmā: like the
laws of the god Savitṛ that hold true. The mahāvyāhṛti-s illustrate
their most apparent domain of action: the near realm, the mid-region and
the realm of the sun. The more expanded set of seven vyāhṛti-s yoked to
the Sāvitrī indicate their broader sphere of action — Mahas: the wider
space. Then we move into the temporal axis: janas: the origin of space
itself. What drives its emergence? tapas: heat. Finally, the very fact
that something exists: satyam: also expressing the inviolable or true
nature of the laws of Savitṛ, the ṛta. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa states:  
ṛtena devaḥ savitā śamāyata  
ṛtasya śṛṅgam urviyā vi paprathe ।  
By the natural law the god Savitṛ exerts himself,  
\[by that\] the antler of the natural law has spread widely.

The Samaveda adds the vyāhṛti, PURUṢA, after SATYAM. This may be seen as
the root of the concept that was later expanded in Sāṃkhyā — the Puruṣa
as consciousness. In placing the final Puruṣa, the singers posited a
system in which the laws and existence itself might be objects in the
conscious experience of the sole reality, the Puruṣa. The next notable
mīmāṃsā of the vyāhṛti-s pertains to the way we deployed the mahāvyāhṛti
triad with the three feet of the AV mantra-s to Viṣṇu. This connection
is declared by the Jaiminīya-s, who state that the vyāhṛti-s were
offered to Viṣṇu. The three feet of the deployed mantra-s indeed
correspond to the three steps of Viṣṇu, who appeared as a dwarf and
suddenly grew to a gigantic size to conquer the worlds from the Dānava-s
with his famed triple strides: bṛhaccharīro vimimāna ṛkvabhir
yuvākumāraḥ praty ety āhavam ॥ As the founder of your race, O Gautamī-s,
states in the primal śruti, that gargantuan form of Viṣṇu is said to
measure out the worlds with the ṛk-s — those are the corresponding AV
ṛk-s we deploy conjoined to the vyāhṛti-s. The Kāṇva-s further add that
those steps were the ones with gathered the atoms — samūḍham asya
paṃsure ॥ — from which the universe condenses. Hence, while uttering
that incantation the ritualist meditates on the great Viṣṇu stamping out
the Asura-s and likewise calls on him to exclude his rivals from his
space. This association with the vyāhṛti-s also extends to Viṣṇu’s wife
in the incantation seen in the Mahānārāyaṇopaniṣat of the late AV
tradition that you all know very well:  
OṂ bhūr lakṣmī bhuvar lakṣmīḥ suvaḥ kālakarṇī tan no mahālakṣmīḥ
pracodayāt ॥  
This incantation is notable in placing Kālakarṇī in suvar. This is from
her association with visible time in the form of the apparent movement
of the sun in the sky. As you all know well from your Āgamika practice
she is none other than the gigantic, dreadful, fanged, death-dealing
eponymous goddess, armed with a bow, arrows, axe, sword, cakra, trident
and a cleaver, emitted by Rudrāṇī from her mouth to terrorize the gods
for their support of Prajāpati Dakṣa. The fourth vyāhṛti mahat is
subliminally hinted by her name Mahālakṣmī, encompassing the wider
space.

Coming the the AV vyāhṛti-s, the coupling OṂ BHŪR JANAT ॥ expiates ṛk
errors and is offered in the Gārhapatya; OṂ BHUVO JANAT ॥ expiates yajuṣ
errors and is offered in the Dakṣiṇa; OṂ SVAR JANAT ॥ expiates Sāman
errors and is offered in the Āhavanīya; OṂ BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD OM ॥
expiates Atharvan errors and is also offered in the Āhavanīya. Here the
JANAT is seen as regenerating the flawed incantations. Vrishchika, it
may interest you that the AV tradition uses a metallurgical analogy of
fusing metals for the welding role of these vyāhṛti-s, unlike the
medical analogy of the Aitareya that you noted. The AV also holds that
the same combination of vyāhṛti-s are the incantations uttered by the
brahman before he asks the udgātṛ to sing the stoma to the god Bṛhaspati
in the somayāga. Likewise he utters the entire gamut of vyāhṛti-s OṂ
BHŪR BHUVAḤ SVAR JANAD VṚDHAT KARAD RUHAN MAHAT TAC CHAM OM when urging
the udgātṛ to sing the song of the Indravant-s derived from the famous
Evayāmarut ṛk to the Marut-s and Viṣṇu that was composed by your
illustrious ancestor, O Indrasena (pra vo mahe matayo yantu viṣṇave
marutvate girijā evayāmarut । pra śardhāya pra yajyave sukhādaye tavase
bhandadiṣṭaye dhunivratāya śavase॥). As an aside that mantra-s is
notable in more than one way but you may note the phrase girijā — Viṣṇu
emerging from the mountain — a mythologem that presages his emergence
from the pillar in the later Nṛsiṃha cycle — but here he emerges with
the marching troop of the Marut-s to head for battle, evidently to join
Indra in the battle against the Dānava-s.

In the purely AV performance, as we did earlier today (or in the
muttered incantation of the brahman), it is deployed with the Indravant
ṛk which illustrates the connections to various vyāhṛti-s. With Agni we
are connected to Bhūr, with Vāta (Vāyu) Bhuvas, with Viṣṇu, the realm of
the Āditya-s. All the special vyāhṛti-s can be seen as having deep
connections with Indra and the Indravant-s. As we saw before the two
praṇava-s at the beginning and the end are the mark of Indra. Janat
indicates the emergence of Viṣṇu and the Marut-s from the mountain,
which is a metaphor for the world axis — thus on one hand it represent
the origin of time that Viṣṇu manifests as. On the other birth of the
Marut-s that made the universe manifest. That manifestation and the
growth of the universe, which is how the sons of Rudra manifest is
indicated by Vṛdhat. Karat is action of filling the universe, as the
ancient Bhārgava, Uśanas Kāvya, is quoted by Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi: karat
tisro maghavā dānucitrā : Maghavan made three realms fill with
glistening droplets. Ruhat, stands for the ascendance of the gods,
manifesting as the rising sun in which they are worshiped. Mahat, as we
saw before represent the great expanse of the universe. Finally Tat and
Śam are the bliss that one attains from the gods upon the success of the
ritual.”

This note records some elementary arithmetic pertaining to triangular
numbers for bālabodhana. In our youth we found that having a flexible
attitude was good thing while obtaining closed forms for simple sums:
for some sums geometry (using methods of proofs pioneered by Āryabhaṭa
which continued down to Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin) was the best way to go;
for others algebra was better. The intuition was in choosing the right
approach for a given sum. We illustrate that with two such sums.

**Sum 1** Obtain a closed form for the sum: ![\\displaystyle
\\sum\_{j=1}^{n}
(2j-1)^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%282j-1%29%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

These sums define a sequence: **1, 28, 153, 496, 1225…**  
Given that we can mostly only visually operate in 3 spatial dimensions,
our intuition suggested that a cubic sum as this is best tackled with
brute-force algebra with the formulae for individual terms derived by
Āryabhaṭa and his commentators. Thus we have:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^{n} (2j-1)^3 = \\sum\_{j=1}^{n} 8 j^3 - 12
j^2 + 6 j-
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%282j-1%29%5E3+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+8+j%5E3+-+12+j%5E2+%2B+6+j-+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![= 2n^2(n+1)^2-2n(n+1)(2n+1)+3n(n+1)-n=
\\dfrac{(2n^2-1)2n^2}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+2n%5E2%28n%2B1%29%5E2-2n%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%2B3n%28n%2B1%29-n%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%282n%5E2-1%292n%5E2%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The reason we wrote out the final solution in this unsimplified form is
to illustrate that the above sums will always be a triangular number of
the form:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^{2j^2-1}
j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7B2j%5E2-1%7D+j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e sums from 1 to **1, 7, 17, 31, 49…** or triangular numbers ![T_1,
T_7, T\_{17},
T\_{31}\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_1%2C+T_7%2C+T_%7B17%7D%2C+T_%7B31%7D%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)th
terms of sequence of sums would be triangular number
![T_m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![m=2j^2-1, j=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2j%5E2-1%2C+j%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the above, one can also see that the difference of successive terms
of our original sequence of sums will be **27, 125, 343, 729…**, i.e.,
they are perfect cubes of the form
![(2k+1)^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282k%2B1%29%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(odd numbers 3, 5, 7, 9…). These cubes are thus the interstitial sums of
the indices
![j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the triangular numbers
![T_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
up to the index
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to the triangular number
![T_m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that is a term of our original sequence. Thus:  
![j\\mapsto](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%5Cmapsto&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
**1**, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, **7**, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, **17**,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, **31**…  
then, 2+3+4…+7=**27**; 8+9+10…+17=**125**; 18+19+20+21+22…+31 =**343**
and so on.

Another interesting feature of the original sequence is its decadal
cycle in the terms of the numbers in the last 2 places (written in
anti-Hindu, i.e. modern order). They will always end in the following
sequence of 10 numbers:  
**0, 1, 28, 53, 6, 25, 6, 53, 28, 1**  
Similarly, the index
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the triangular numbers
![T_m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the define our sequence also shows a pentadic cycle in the last place of
the form:  
**1, 7, 7, 1, 9**

A comparable pattern is seen if we generate a sequence that is the sum
of successive terms of our original sequence: **1, 29, 181, 649, 1721,
3781, 7309, 12881…** The last place has a pentadic cycle of the form:
1,9,1,9,1. The last 2 places has a cycle of length 25: 01, 29, 81, 49,
21, 81, 09, 81, 69, 41, 61, 89, 81, 89, 61, 41, 69, 81, 09, 81, 21, 49,
81, 29, 01. Both are palindromic cycles.

Finally, the sum of the reciprocals of the original sequence converges
to a constant: 1.04607799646… We suspect there is a closed form for this
constant but have not been able to identify it.

**Sum 2** Obtain a closed form for the sum of alternating negative and
positive perfect squares: -1+4-9+16… i.e.

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^n (-1)^j
j^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+%28-1%29%5Ej+j%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

With the sum involving just square terms it is possible to use a
wordless geometric proof along the lines of that proposed by Āryabhaṭa
(Figure 1).

[![Sum_neg_pos_squares](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/sum_neg_pos_squares.png?w=480&h=456)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/sum_neg_pos_squares.png)

Figure 1.

Thus, we get the above sum as ![-1^n
T_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1%5En+T_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where

In American history-writing we come across various attempts to the
justify the use of nuclear weapons on Japan in the closing phase of WW2.
We often hear the claim that by using the nukes they avoided a large
number of casualties that they would have suffered in a long-drawn
conventional war to conquer Japan. Neutral outsiders who have studied
the matter realize that this is merely the American narrative to justify
and positively spin something, which many of their own people (some
leaders included) found rather disturbing. A closer look indicates that
the Japanese were brought to the brink of surrender by the demolition
they faced at the hands of the Rus in Manchuria. Indeed, the Rus were
poised to invade the main islands and probably kill the emperor of
Japan. Faced with this, the Japanese calculated that surrendering to the
Americans might help them save the emperor and perhaps avert a more
brutal assault that the Soviet military would have subjected them to.
Were the Americans aware of this? While we rarely hear anything pointing
in this direction in the many American presentations of these events, it
seems very likely to us that the Americans were fully aware of the
situation. Hence, we posit that the reason the Americans used the nukes
on densely populated Japanese cities was to graphically demonstrate to
the Rus what the “super-weapons” in their possession could do and that
their leaders were dead serious about earlier hints they had given the
Rus. Hence, the intended audience for nukes was likely the Soviets
rather than the Japanese. This was one of clearest examples of a
technological change of game in times closer to our own. The Rus and
other nations eventually developed their own nuclear weapons despite the
American attempts to prevent some of them from succeeding. However, we
do think that being the first to make and use the nukes contributed in a
big way to the American rise to superpower status.

There are indications that the rising new religion of Navyonmāda might
be turning that arc of American superpowerdom to towards the horizontal;
however, even in these days of late empire the accumulated technological
capital of the superpower could make a major difference in the “war of
the day”. We had briefly alluded to this in the past note. In this note,
we shall expand a bit on that. Right from when the Wuhan corruption
exploded among the Cīna-s, it was clear that the disease was being used
as a geopolitical tool. With hindsight we can say that the Cīna-s knew
early on that it was a respiratory disease likely transmitted by the
airborne route. Despite all the show of disinfecting the streets of
Wuhan with chemical sprays, early in the epidemic they were wearing
masks and practicing social distancing. However, they did little to stop
international traffic despite restricting internal traffic between
cities with high infection. Moreover, via the WHO, they initially held
back information on human-to-human spread instead pointing to wet
markets. Then they used the WHO to project messages about washing hands
rather than wearing the appropriate masks (Sure, early the cruise ship
incidents had a norovirus-like fomite feel to it, but the Cīna-s knew
better). Thus, even as they facilitated an information blackout to the
rest of the world, within their own borders they took draconian measures
of isolation and blockade to curb the disease. As a result, even as the
left-liberal occidental media was running paradoxical pieces on how
“totalitarian” governments fare worse with pandemics and how
Vijayanāma-vyāpārin was being xenophobic towards their Galtonian
partners, the virus breached their defenses and established itself in
their midst. The result was waves of massacres that really made the
occidental powers look limp. At the end of it, emperor Xi had deftly
leveraged the epidemic in his lands to hit his rivals while hiding his
own losses from it.

1

With the virus established in their midst, both the Cīna-s and the
mleccha-s soon realized that lasting victory could only be achieved by
an effective treatment — vaccination being the method of choice for the
long-term. Here is where a technological race, like the one to make the
nukes, came to the fore. It was not easy, given that human coronavirus
vaccination programs (like those inspired by SARS) had not really
reached their culmination as the disease had been curbed by public
health measures well before a vaccine became necessary. Figure 1 shows
the popular vaccines in use or close to deployment (by no means
comprehensive) classified by method, along with the country that
developed them. One can see that the Americans were able mobilize
multiple vaccines based on “advanced methods” — i.e. those using
artificial mRNA with modified nucleobases, adenovirus vectors and
baculovirus expression systems. The most basic of these technologies,
i.e., cloning of the gene for the viral spike protein, can be easily
mastered. However, to develop a truly successful vaccine, there is a lot
more knowledge and technology that needs to be in place. These include:
1) the knowledge of and a repository of vector viruses like the Human
Adenoviruses 26 and 5, or the Chimpanzee Adenovirus in the vector-based
vaccines. 2) the capacity for chemical synthesis of nucleic acids for
producing codon-optimized genes. 3) A knowledge of protein structure and
evolution to produce optimal S protein constructs to be used as
vaccines. 4) In the case of mRNA vaccines, the knowledge of and the
capacity to synthesize modified nucleobases. The *de novo* development
of these vaccines need a long-standing and well-developed culture of
molecular biology and biochemistry. The totality of this knowledge is
possessed by only a few nations in the world. Thus, developing the
vaccine indigenously from scratch is not possible for most of the world.
This fact in itself can be weaponized in a pandemic situation to gain a
geopolitical advantage. It is in this regard that the superpower capital
accumulated by the USA remains unchallenged.

Of the others, the British managed to successfully develop an
adenovirus-based vaccine, showing that their accumulated intellectual
capital still powers some technological propulsion in crisis. While we
do not know as much regarding the success of the Russian attempt from
external trials, they too seem to have achieved something comparable to
the Brits with their Sputnik vaccine. Their subunit vaccine seems to
deploy a rather unusual concept and its true efficacy remains entirely
unclear to us. Still the gulf between these and the multiple American
successes remains, illustrating the distinction between the great powers
and the superpower. Several other nations possess the scientific and
technological capacity to develop vaccines by themselves. In the Orient,
we have Japan and Korea. In the Occident we have Germany and France.
None of these have managed to develop and deploy their own vaccines to
date. Some of them are even facing the adverse edge of not having a
suitable vaccine that they can use. This hints that the task at hand it
not easy in practice, even if a nation were to possess the theoretical
know-how.

The Cīna-s have shown great prowess in molecular biology in recent
times. A closer look at their research capacity in this regard has shown
a tendency for plagiarism, faking and imitation of more original work
coming from elsewhere. However, as the Americans say, you can fake it
till you make it. Keeping with that, the Cīna-s have recently managed
some pieces of high-end original research suggesting that they are
coming of age. However, this is not visible in term of the vaccines that
they have managed to deploy — to date they have only managed the
conventional inactivated viral vaccines. There are suggestions that they
have been trying to pilfer more advanced technologies and reverse
engineer them, but we are yet to see the results of those attempts.
Thus, the head-start the Cīna-s had with the virus has not really
translated into vaccinological success. Finally, coming to India, we
infer that the leadership correctly realized the danger posed by the
virus to a populous country with little scope for urban social
distancing and went for obtaining a vaccine as soon as possible.
Perhaps, they correctly judged that the Indian biotechnological capacity
was not up to the mark of developing any of the advanced vaccines
indigenously *in time*. However, they did leverage the same low-tech
solution as the Cīna-s to develop the indigenous inactivated virus
Covaxin vaccine. Wisely, in a parallel track they purchased a stake in
the AstraZeneca adenoviral vector vaccine developed by the Brits and the
American subunit vaccine Novovax for local manufacture.

Next we come to the question of how these vaccines actually fared on the
ground. The American and British image had taken a heavy beating at the
hands of the virus by early 2021. The US had stacked up nearly a million
deaths from the virus in an year (with almost 1 in 10 Americans being
infected), while the count in UK is at least 200,000 (probably 1 in
12-15 people have been infected, keeping in mind their poorer accounting
of cases ). However, both these nations have flattened their curves and
have gone a long way towards mitigating the pandemic in their lands.
This is in no small measure from the success of their vaccines — the
capacity to develop and deploy them in time. The confidence in this
success in the US is reflected in the recent CDC statement relaxing the
use of masks among the fully vaccinated. From the viewpoint of both
cases and fatalities, France and Germany have done poorly with respect
to their island counterpart — to us this is a clear indication of their
failure at vaccine deployment. A similar situation is seen with Poland —
a western aligned Slavic nation. The Russian situation is harder to
assess. Despite their Sputnik vaccine being apparently successful (as
per their published papers) they have had no success in bringing down
their deaths significantly from mid-February to mid-May 2021. The causes
for this remain unclear to us.

Coming to the Cīna-s, they saw immense potential to use
vaccine-diplomacy to leverage their head-start with the virus and the
pandemic they had helped create. They sent their vaccines to all takers
but as of date of this note there are no great results to see. Recently,
a good comparison has come up in the form of two countries, the small
Israel and the tiny Seychelles. Given the ties the CEO of Pfizer company
has to Israel, they were able to obtain that vaccine right away. The
latter received the Sinopharm (majority) and AstraZeneca (minority)
vaccines. The former managed to control the epidemic within their
borders with their mass vaccination program, whereas the later has so
far failed to do so despite fully vaccinating 60% of its people. In
large part this seems to stem from the lackluster performance of the
Cīna vaccine. UAE, which also deployed this Cīna vaccine, is now
thinking of going for a 3rd dose to improve immunity. The results of
Sinovac in the field are not inspiring confidence either. Further
evidence for the Cīna failure comes from the statements of emperor Xi
asking for international collaboration on vaccines. Why would he want
“collaboration” if his “guns” were firing alright? This generally poor
performance of the conventional inactivated virus vaccine raises
questions about how the Indian Covaxin would fare in the field — we
still await the official publications in this regard.

A recent study by Khoury et al indicates that the modified mRNA vaccines
developed in the US provided the strongest neutralizing-antibody
response, whereas the AstraZeneca vaccine providse a lower tier
response. Moreover, it also appears that the American vaccines are
likely to provide sufficient (severe disease/death) protection against
the B.1.351 South African strain whereas the AZ vaccine might be far
less efficacious in preventing infection by that strain. In conclusion,
the vaccine race has left the Americans as the clear winner both in
terms of currently possessing the best vaccines (and an abundance of
them) and having reasonable success in controlling the disease (As of
the date of writing, the US still has a 7 day rolling average of over
500 deaths daily but we suspect in large part this can be contained if
more people were proactive in getting the vaccines and observing
disease-limiting behavior). This allows them to weaponize the vaccine in
geopolitics.

It is precisely this point which brings us to the Indian situation.
India began by handling the first wave reasonably well. This was
followed by a good start to the vaccination program among elderly people
with the AZ vaccine. Then we saw the Indian version of vaccine
diplomacy, where the mass manufacture of the AZ vaccine was used to
distribute it to several small countries, including those in the
Caribbean. The overconfidence and behavioral recklessness (mask laxity
and vaccination hesitancy) which ensued, along with ignorance of the
function
![y=ke^{rx}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dke%5E%7Brx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
poorly managed testing and contact-tracing, Khalistani rioting in the
Panjab spreading the British B.1.1.7 strain, and the emergence of the
(likely) more virulent B.1.617 strain resulted in the brutal second
wave. Evidence from both within India and the UK indicates that the
B.1.617 strain can displace other ambient strains, making it
particularly dangerous. While this strain breaks past the AZ vaccine and
causes disease, that vaccine seems to be capable of preventing
death/serious disease in most vaccinated people. Thus, it was of
paramount importance for India to ramp up vaccine production and
vaccinate as many people as possible. While we admit that is a difficult
task for a big country, we feel that the inability to keep up the
vaccination program as a percentage of the population was a one of
failures on the part of the nation.

The question which then arises is what the proximal cause for this might
be. In our opinion, a major reason for this was the embargo placed on
raw material by the Mahāmleccha led by Vṛddhapiṇḍaka. If one were to
game Mahāmleccha geopolitical realism from it is foundational principle,
it is obvious they would do everything to limit any rival potentate that
aspires “great power” status. Even if it is regional player, it has to
be broken if it marginally challenges the pañcanetra mleccha power.
Moreover, Vṛddhapiṇḍaka has been placed in power by Big Tech and
navyonmāda which has a svabhāva-vairam with all things H. Thus, H power,
however, limited in the big picture is not something they tolerate —
they were in particular pricked by Indian vaccine-diplomacy in their own
hemisphere. Thus, they decided to use their victory in the vaccine war
to settle scores with the Lāṭeśvara by limiting resources during the
critical phase of the second wave in India. The job has been done as it
took quite a bit of the sheen of the nation and showed it to be no
better than a third-rate power, leave alone aspirations of “great power”
status. Importantly, it has also taken the sheen of the the Lāṭeśvara,
even among those generally supportive of him. The evidence for the
mleccha hand is further supported by the active subversion program by
Big Tech (Jāka-Bejha-Mukhagiri-Dvārādiduṣṭāḥ), Soraduṣṭa and the first
responders dove-tailing their action with this wave.

That said, the deeper problem is the failure of the H to learn from
history. Such perfidious mleccha action has been seen time and again —
for instance the mleccha mercenaries hired by the Marāṭḥā-s or the sale
of defective weapons by the English to them. Hence, the H leadership
should have been prepared for mleccha action against them, especially
with overthrow of Vijaya-nāma-vyāpārin in their land by the
navyonmatta-s. They should have prepared to source key materials to keep
themselves afloat in the vaccine war. The production failures are seen
more generally with things like antifungals (e.g. amphotericin B) which
are needed to tackle the ongoing epidemic of mycoses accompanying the
Wuhan disease. An even deeper issue is the regard for research in India.
Before the pandemic there was a generally dismissive attitude towards
doing hard original science (not scientism or show-science) among the H.
Instead, most people with such capacity were being funneled to quite a
degree into service industries that do not ultimately make a nation a
“great power”. You cannot build up scientific capacity to do hard stuff
overnight and the results can be seen. The physicians and nurses on the
ground are limited if there is no scientific capacity holding them up.

Many people experience beauty in structures with bilateral, radial and
rotational symmetries with or without recursion. The recursive or nested
structure are the foundation of the beauty in fractal form, the
generation of which has become increasingly easy for the lay person with
ever-improving computing power. One could generate beautiful fractal
structures using a range of open source software; however, there is no
substitute for writing ones own code and taking in some of the
mathematics behind the beauty — truly fractal structures provide the
clearest bridge between mathematics and beauty. While we have presented
some discussion on such structures on these pages, that is not the topic
of this note. Here, we shall talk about stuff that is mostly art for
art’s sake (We fully understand that what constitutes art can have some
subjectivity) that is generated based on simple repeats of certain
motifs with an emphasis on radial and rotational symmetries.

For at least three generations, there has been a strand in our family
with an interest in generating such art. While there certainly exist
people with much greater skill than us (you can even see manifestations
of genius in this regard), the driving force for us is the pleasure
derived from process of generating such art. One experiences a climax,
when the process of polishing the work culminates in a first person
experience of beatific satisfaction. In the two previous generations,
the main medium was the powder (rice flour, stone and other colored
powders) used in traditional alaṃkāra. In our case it began with
spending time in our youth with a kaleidoscope. That inspiration was
then transferred to paper, pen and compass but eventually it
transitioned to computer-aided *in silico* tools. Over the years we have
used many tools each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The
first programs we used were CorelDraw and Canvas. The latter, at that
time, was available to only on a Mac. It was a decent program but
expensive. Moreover, we never owned a Mac, and using it on a public or a
borrowed Mac was hardly convenient. Hence, it fell to the way side. I
continue to use CorelDraw for professional stuff, especially if the work
needs freedom of the hand and has some complexity; however, it is
expensive and a typical user might only be able access it via a funding
agency. Then the open source Inkscape came along, which evolved to be a
reasonable free substitute for CorelDraw. Although CorelDraw is
“smoother” to use, the current version of Inkscape is not bad at all.

However, we wanted something more “programmable” where one could adjust
various numerical parameters rather than going freehand — a language for
graphics. The first such we looked at was MetaPost — it had, what to us
were unfriendly aspects; however, the time we spent exploring it was not
a total waste because in the second decade of the 2000s of CE we learnt
of the existence of the PGF/TikZ (ironically named: “TikZ ist kein
Zeichenprogramm) languages that greatly improved on MetaPost in our
subjective opinion. Notably it could be used from within
![\\LaTeX](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CLaTeX&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we finally settled on TikZ as the language to write these pieces
of art in. Following is an example of such with the compiled result
appended below.

This example uses decadal symmetry with central tetrad element. In our
subjective experience tetrad symmetry can be paired with other even
symmetries as long as they central or the exterior most elements.

Ideally all repeated motifs should have at least bilateral symmetry.
However, one can get away with a layer or two of elements with just
rotational symmetry, like the “S” element in Figure 2. The choice of
color is another very important element — we like a degree of contrast
in all the piece. Appended below are a range of productions illustrating
different color choices.

**Figure 6.**

Vidrum had been introduced to a synesthetic patient by a neurologist
colleague. The patient’s manifestation of synesthesia left a rather
profound impact on him; thus, when he had a break of an hour in his
duties, wanting to explore the issue more, he decided to do some quiet
reading on his computer in the library. He took his favorite seat beside
the window looking out into a sylvan patch, and thought to himself:
“This display of synesthesia would have interested Vrishchika a lot.”
Even as he said so to himself, to his utter shock, he saw someone
looking just like Lootika or Vrishchika go past him and take a seat
another a little ahead. He almost exclaimed aloud: “that cannot be true!
they are away in a faraway land enjoying the pleasures of conjunction
with their puruṣa-s.” He looked at the girl again and realized it had to
be Jhilleeka. “What is she doing here? This is not her kṣetra.” He
walked up to her: “Hey Jhilli, what are you doing here. For a moment, I
thought it was one of your sisters who had manifested themselves using
their ghostly powers.” Jhilleeka smiled but seemed to be a bit at a loss
to say anything. Vidrum went on: “I’ve not seen you in a while, but you
have become a light-eyed version of your sisters.” Jh: “I’m taking that
to be a compliment, but it must be just some homozygosity that found its
way into me. Hope you are alright and fully recovered from the
tumultuous events that are now past us.” V: “Let the past lie. But are
you alright?” Vidrum pointed to her bandaged foot.

Jh: “Sort of. But that wound is the result of what one could call an
adventure of sorts.” V: “What happened?” Jh: “If you run into my
parents, do not tell them the whole thing. But if you want to hear the
story, we can go outside.” V: “Sure.” By some fancy, I decided to take
the shortcut through Viṇmārga back home from the university, which, as
you know, passes through the rougher part of the city. From there, I
took the bylane that leads to Mahiṣamūtra-mārga, and I quickly sighted
that a knot of roughs led by Sphicmukha and Chāgalaṇḍa, who I believe
were your classmates at school, had laid a predatory trap. They had set
large branches of Vachellia bramble on the road to funnel drivers onto
the side they had littered with nails and other metal objects. I avoided
them from puncturing my bike but, in a flash of indiscretion, decided to
kick one of the pegs out of the way while still riding — that did not go
well, and I ended up with a deep cut on my leg. That’s why I came here
to get a tetanus shot. I’m just waiting for my father to get back home.”
V: “Some of the characteristic traits of your elder sisters are very
much visible in you too. In any case, is this not your last month in
college? I’m sure you are pursuing graduate school like your elder
sisters.”

Jh: “That is correct. Prachetas and I did contemplate whether to start a
company of our own and give grad school a skip given the deteriorating
environment in educational institutions abroad. Thankfully, we got over
that delusion after some further thought as we realized we were v1s to
our core and not v3s by nature. Nor were we inclined to take the job
offers we had because we have that independent academic streak.
Moreover, we got into the same graduate school; so, we would not be
facing the separation and the disjunction that Lootika and Somakhya
faced when in graduate school.” V: “But those two told me that their
disjunction was a key part of their character-building experience where
they proved their individual worth by themselves.” Jh: “That may be so,
but you can hardly deny that Lootika and Somakhya had the luck of being
together all the way from school to the end of college — something the
rest of us did not have the pleasure of. So that disjunction is not
something they needed to cry about. Moreover, for all the ice in that
period, the rest of us knew how Lootika kept thinking about Somakhya. We
thought grad school is a good idea because, apart from the fact that we
are fundamentally academically oriented, it gives an opportunity to
prove ourselves under hostile fire. If luck, for some reason, doesn’t
favor us, we can always quit it and get down to more real things like
furthering our genes. If everything fails, in the least, I can teach my
nephews and nieces mathematics and computation as they come of age.”

V: “Well, good luck. But even if you don’t start a company, I hope
someday you and maybe Prachetas will build for me a robot that is like
the late lamented Meghana.” Jhilleeka chuckled: “What purpose would such
a robot serve even if we were to build it? Talk to Lootika and Somakhya
— they will teach you a mantra of the Southern Path. Meditating thus on
Śiva and Bhairavī, you will attain your desire more satisfyingly.” V:
“Young lady, they are far away, and we are not in frequent touch. It is
hard to find a time that matches to talk to them — let alone them
imparting me a mantra. Moreover, do you even believe such mantra-s
work?” Jh: “Well, you will learn if they work or not. Never mind if you
don’t want to ask them about this, there is always the musical bone-pipe
my sister Vrishchika gave you.” V: “Jhilli, do you think Meghana could
be summoned that way?” Jh: “She may visit you that way, but it is not
something you want to look forward to. It will not be pleasant. But the
other phantoms who come to you via the bone-pipe might help you reach
the equilibrium you seek.” Just then, Jhilleeka got her father’s call,
and Vidrum had to return to his duties.

Lootika’s medallion

The following Saturday, Vidrum’s duties had ended by the afternoon;
early that evening, he went with Sharvamanyu and Abhirosha for dinner.
A: “So Vidrum, when will the construction of your new house begin?” V:
“Sadly, it is not happening! If anything, my luck seems to remain the
same” S: “But why — were you not set to hire the contractors?” V: “It is
a strange story. But I decided it is better safe than sorry.” S: “I
don’t get it! But if you don’t want to share it with us, fine.” V: “Oh
no! I would gladly do so, but you may think I am crazily superstitious.”
A: “Now that makes us even more curious.”

V: “Have you ever been gifted something interesting by the four
sisters?” A: “Now, why do you ask that of all things? But yes.”
Abhirosha pulled out an inlay-work medallion from her bag and showed it
to Vidrum. “This is some art Lootika made for me. I realized that it was
more than just art because she said that there was no need to display it
but to just keep it with me, somewhere close.” Saying so, Abhirosha
handed it to Vidrum. Looking at it closely, he passed it to Sharvamanyu:
“It has a nice feel to it. Our friend has some eye for symmetry. I saw
Vrishchika making something similar for her husband Indrasena shortly
after the tumultuous events. What I received was something more sinister
— a bone-pipe made from a human femur. Vrishchika gave it to me. But
they all seem to know of it, for the other day, the youngest Jhilleeka
asked me to ply it.”

A: “Now, how did you run into Jhilli?” V: “Well, that is a story of its
own.” S: “Fine, but what does all this have to do with your abandoning
the construction of your new house.” V: “Listen, it is a long and crazy
story. If you blow into that bone-pipe you can get nice and haunting
tunes. The haunting part is very real — it is not at all uncommon for a
phantom to manifest thereafter and tell you something. The short story
is that I was rather depressed with my luck that day and vocalized that
matter to Jhilli. She reminded me of the bone-pipe her sister had given
me and asked me to ply it.”

S: “OK, that sounds like an interesting object — a blast from the past —
you never showed it to us?” V: “Well, I’ll show it to you guys the next
time you’re home. I had put it aside, given all the trauma from the last
visitation. But I realized paying attention to those visitations can
actually be helpful. The encounter I had was somewhat dramatic.” A: “Ah!
This sounds like the old times. Tell us the story.” V: “Sure. I blew
into the pipe a song I heard in a movie — I’m sure it was one I had
watched with you guys. The phantom came on very fast. I had hardly blown
out a couple of lines, when I heard a gruff voice with a south Indian
accent. I did not see anything, but I could feel an obvious presence. He
asked to be seated on the couch across from my desk, saying that he
needs a proper seat to ease his distress. I took a dictation of his
story that I’ll read out once we are done with dinner.” It went thus:

“My name is Gunottaman (Guṇottaman), but most of the people who knew me
called me Kāttutĕran, a moniker I acquired from my capacity to drive my
father’s car at incredible speeds even as a ten-year-old. My family
hails from the Dravidian country but had moved to the Karnāṭa country.
While we came from a brahminical background, my father was the last in
our lineage to have a slung a thread on his shoulder. He was a man of
vision and modernity. He told us there was nothing to be gained by
studying supernatural śloka-s and songs with which the brahmins earned a
living by fooling gullible people. Instead, he said we should choose the
Buddha, the Christ and Mahatma Gandhi as role models for leading a good
and ethical life. In my teens, I read a little information pamphlet and
added a new figure to that pantheon. He was the great biochemist
Yerrapragada Subbarow. I was inspired by him to discover new drugs.
Accordingly, I studied for a B.Sc. in chemistry and a further degree in
chemical engineering from a reputed college.

Shortly after that, I became acquainted with a biologist known as
Ayyangār. He had identified an amoeba-killing compound from an
actinobacterium but did not know what it was. He saw the potential for
making it into a treatment for amoebiasis, which raging in some
villages. Having obtained a grant, he teamed up with me, and I showed
that it was a peptaibol. Eventually, I even synthesized the peptaibol,
which earned me a thesis and many accolades, including an invitation to
work at a Japanese university. Having cleared that hurdle, I was now
renowned as a double Ph.D. and was offered a professorship at a college.
A couple of years into that, I realized that the humdrum teaching of
dullards was not for me. I wanted to emulate my heroes and do good to
humanity. I wished to make pharmaceuticals, but that path was not easy
for a man with a modest income. By then, I was married and already had
two children, and a third was on the way. But some luck came my way. I
had a friend from college, Adhyankar (Āḍhyaṃkara), hailing from the
merchant community. He had started a paint business that was flourishing
due to the housing boom. One day, over lunch, he asked me if I could
synthesize anti-fungal compounds for his paints. He had been importing
these compounds and said that any breakthrough would result in a
significant profit of which I would receive a share. While it was not
the pharmaceutical work I wanted to do, I saw it as a break and took a
one-year voluntary suspension from my college job to set up a lab funded
by Adhyankar. My hard work paid off, and I synthesized a siloxane
halamine derivative that could work well as an anti-fungal. With my
team, we soon set up an industrial manufacturing process for producing
and incorporating it into Adhyankar’s paints.

A major problem in our country is the discoloration of walls by
cyanobacteria. Hence, I wondered if we could augment our paints with
anti-cyanobacterials. During my Ph.D. in Japan, I had made acquaintance
with a fellow graduate student who had identified and determined the
structure of anti-cyanobacterial compound which had the sequence:
Me_3R-V-V-OHMeR-MeR.
I synthesized a truncated brominated derivative thereof that had
100-fold higher anti-cyanobacterial activity. When we brought this into
production, I was able to negotiate a fuller partnership in the company
of Adhyankar. The profits helped me to dabble with my true interests. I
realized that the antiviral field was a wide-open opportunity, and
Adhyankar was willing to again partner with me, thereby giving me a long
rope to explore exciting possibilities.

By then, I had a flourishing family with three sons and a daughter. What
is misery to some can be a gain for others. It was around that time the
Great Dhori Virus Outbreak fell upon us. Building on my
anti-cyanobacterial work, I had synthesized a bacterial cyanoalkaloid,
whose halogenated derivatives had an excellent antiviral capacity that
played a decisive role in flattening that outbreak. From the profits
materialized during this time, I wanted to build a new lab and plant. I
bribed a derelict temple’s management to procure some good land
bypassing the usual bureaucratic strictures. During the building of the
new lab, we unearthed a religious image that the Hiṇḍū-s worship under
the name of some god, I think he is called Śiva. While I cared little
for such superstition, I did not want it to be destroyed because it
might be an object of veneration for people who believe in such things.
Hence, I handed it over to some pundits at a temple. With a new lab in
place, I often took my children there to intern and develop a scientific
temper.

However, my fortune seems to have peaked there, and it was all downhill
thereafter. My daughter acquired an undiagnosed neurological illness and
committed suicide by jumping off the balcony in a fit of delirium. Then
my youngest son developed a mysterious idiopathic anemia and died
despite all our attempts to treat him. My next son, like me, was a great
car enthusiast, but this proved to be the tragedy of our lives. He too
enjoyed the thrill of speeding but sadly lost control of the car and
expired on hitting a flyover pillar. Perhaps due to this stress or maybe
due to her nature, my wife upbraided and slapped our eldest son one day
in front of all his friends for not doing as well as we had expected in
one of his exams. He was angered by that and ran away from home, and we
never saw him again despite filing many a missing person report. Then
when my turn came, it almost seemed like relief from all the suffering I
was going through. I was altered by the alarm system regarding a problem
in the lab. I was initially informed by the staff that there was nothing
to fear. I thought it was just a false alarm and casually went in a
little later to check things. At that point, there was a big phosgene
leak, and I died from the exposure.

What happened thereafter was remarkable. I could see my corpse being
donated by my wife to the hospital for study. With much horror, I
watched it being cut up and my tissue being examined microscopically and
analyzed. After what was left of my corpse was consigned to oxidation at
the incinerator by Adhyankar, something even more striking happened. I
found myself sitting in a ghostly corpus on a large boulder that lay
outside my laboratory building. Marching in front of me was a vast horde
of other ghostly beings. Some looked like skeletons, others had strange
animal heads, yet others had a misty, shape-shifting nature. Far behind,
I saw the leaders of that horde of ghosts — they were emitting a
radiance and appeared more real than anything I had seen in life. I
think they were gods, as I remember seeing images in the likenesses of
them being taken out during Hiṇḍū festivals. One of them had an
ape-face, another had six heads, yet another a proboscis, and still
another was a dark bluish-black hue. A ghost from that immense horde
came up to me and said: \`You are appointed as the regent of this land
that you once purchased through underhand means from the temple. You
shall sit here and keep others away from it after your lab has been
demolished. I spent a while wandering in my lab as though doing
experiments but finally, one day, a government crew appeared and
demolished it. I sat on the stone and made it my routine to haunt anyone
who trespassed it grimly. When you bought this land, you came with a
brahmin and his wife to take possession. They seemed to have some spells
to those very same gods I saw when I was appointed as the guardian of
the land. Hence, I was rendered powerless to do anything to you or them
then. But now that it is just you, I can knead you like dough. If you
were to build on this land, I shall reduce you to a fate that is not
very different from mine. If you do not, and let my stone remain, then I
will even use my ghostly powers to aid your quest for a new vehicle, a
woman and a house.”

Abhirosha: “Vidrum, even I would have acted the same if I’d had
encountered a phantasmagoria as this.” V: “Even if this were just an
illusion, spurred by the visitation, I did some investigations that led
me to a clear decision. I dug up old reports that the city auction had
hidden from me. Those showed that indeed a chemical laboratory had stood
on that plot. It was demolished after being decommissioned following an
accident, and the plant nearby had been shut down for safety issues. I
reasoned that the mysterious deaths of our visitor’s children were
probably again from the poor safety leading to their affliction by toxic
compounds. Who knows, some toxic stuff might still be lingering therein.
Hence, I thought it prudent to abandon the plan of building my house on
that site and let the agents of Mahādeva reclaim it.”

Vrishchika’s medallion

At some point last year, we stopped writing any further dispatches
regarding the pandemic catastrophe from the ![\\omega \\upsilon o
\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega+%5Cupsilon+o+%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
disease because everything was playing out more or less as laid out in
the earlier notes. There was the whole public drama around the
“lab-leak” hypothesis that was widely disseminated by the Jewish
American intellectual Weinstein and his wife Heying. While they and
their cohort made some good points, there were specific counterpoints
that nobody in those academic circles was able to bring to the
discussion. Having studied this virus closely and having discovered
multiple new things about its evolution, we had laid those out in our
[earlier
dispatches](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/05/17/pandemic-days-4-viruses-get-new-hosts/).
So, we were not too disposed towards reiterating it.

The effects of the pandemic reached far beyond the human disaster — it
played with the internal stability and politics of several nations
across the world. It fueled the explosive growth of the American mental
disease,
[navyonmāda](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/),
following incidents of police brutality, typical of the Mahāmleccha. As
a result, among the Mahāmleccha, Vijaya-nāma-vyāpārī was overthrown by
the navyonmatta activists in Big (primarily imaginary)-Tech and Media
and replaced by their candidate Vṛddha-piṇḍaka and the sūtradhāriṇī
Ardhā, who works the former like a putalikā on behalf of the operators
in the deep-state and Big-Tech. Now in the driver’s seat, they moved
quickly to impose the navyonmāda religion on the population of America —
the full extant of the steps taken for its imposition are striking
(supported by statistics and raw data) but cannot be narrated for now.
Indeed, in retrospect, it now appears that the Nāriṅgapuruṣa was the
last line of defense against dam-burst of navyonmāda. Its capture of a
serious fraction of the Mahāmleccha elite is evidenced in nearly all the
ejaculations of Piṇḍaka’s courtiers; now, they even intend flying the
dhvaja of navyonmāda at their dūtya-s. In essence, the Piṇḍaka-śāsana is
giving a taste of how it might have been for the heathens when the
second and third unmāda-s were taking over West Asia and Europe.

If this had remained restricted to the Mahāmleccha, then the rest of the
world might not be too bothered about it. In fact, rival powers would
have rejoiced at it because it will eventually weaken the Mahāmleccha
(at least temporarily). But like any physical infectious disease, this
memetic one is also infectious. Just like the overt unmāda-s,
[navyonmāda too has a natural enmity towards the
deva-dharma](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/huntington-and-the-clash-21-years-later/).
Hence, it will act in similar ways to destabilize any political party or
arrangement that might even marginally help H growth. It is brought into
India via the first responders and mleccha-trained academics, and is
also casually dispersed to the young urban population by the occidental
media. During the Kangress era, the judiciary too was subverted by
several crypto-proponents of sympathizers of this neo-religion. This is
perhaps one of the most imminent dangers of navyonmāda given the power
the court holds in the Indian political arrangement. It has also taken a
deep root in centers of higher science and technology education such as
the IITs, IISERs, and TIFRs, where several academics mimic their
left-liberal counterparts in the west and engage in anti-Hindu action
guided by navyonmāda. Thus, when navyonmatta-s from a scientific
tabloid, like the Nature magazine, interview people for something
regarding India, they goes to their co-religionists (i.e.,
navyonmatta-s) in Indian academia. These will invariably paint an anti-H
picture. To give a concrete example, I know a senior academic who had
served at the IISERs and Ashoka University (a navyonmāda nest) who
wanted to give his students “a balanced view” that the great rājan
Śivajī was a bandit. This means a whole crop of young H, especially
those in the crucial research and technology fields, are being
indoctrinated into the neo-religion. Given this situation, the rise of
Piṇḍaka meant that this wing of internal navyonmatta-s would be
strengthened in the deśa.

This is how it indeed played out. An uṣnīṣin rebellion passing off as a
kīnāśakopa was fomented in the Pāñcanada, that too during an ongoing
pandemic. The discerning clearly saw the pattern, as it followed along
the lines of the earlier CAA riots, the Bhim riots, and the Patel riots.
However, in this case, they were conclusively outed as a Swedish
front-end for navyonmatta, who is on the Asperger’s spectrum, spilled
the “toolkit” of the first responders leading to the quick arrest of
some of their agents. Their subsequent interrogation revealed even more
of their intent. The Indian government was rather mild with and gave a
long rope to these rioters. This puzzled many nationalistic observers
who were hoping for firm action that the śādhu was reputedly capable of.
Our reading is that the H are relatively weak in their ground state and
the security apparatus knows that. Moreover, they also feared opening of
a border front with the Cīna-s while tackling internal rebellions.
Hence, for good optics with the mleccha-s the H leadership did not act
firmly. Thus, unlike the Cīna-s dealing with their rebels, the H have to
go soft as they cannot take on the Mahāmleccha under Piṇḍaka, who will
back the rioters, unlike the overthrown Nāriṅgapuruṣa. Our prediction
from a little over a month back was that the Mahāmleccha would continue
such action until at least the end of the year or till the possible
event of their king Piṇḍaka falling prey to jara resulting in some
internal turmoil.

Returning to the ![\\omega \\upsilon o
\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega+%5Cupsilon+o+%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
disease, the first wave in India was bad, but the nation as a whole
fared much better than most other hard-hit countries. By the end of the
civil year 2020 CE, it was coming down even as it was exploding in the
USA. By the first two months of 2021, it looked as though India was on
top of the pandemic and the vaccination program was initiated. It was
going well by early March even though a lot of eligible people were not
taking it. The corresponding program was doing much worse at that point
in the US — some people were driving a long way to neighboring towns and
cities to get their shots. A Pakistan physician was arrested by the
mleccha-s for giving the vaccine that would be otherwise wasted to
“people with Indian-sounding names!” because of their kṛṣṇa-rudhira sham
policy. Unfortunately, on the H side a basic lesson of epidemiology was
forgotten. Infectious respiratory disease epidemics show wave dynamics.
The classic precedent of the Spanish flu of 1918 CE shows that the
second wave can be worse than the first because more infectious and/or
more virulent mutants can emerge, especially with the effective
population size of the virus being large along with a large as yet
uninfected population. The same dynamic was seen with the milder H1N1
epidemic in the USA. Even the limited SARS outbreak showed waves.
Several countries had already experienced two waves of SARS-CoV-2, with
the second being worse than the first. In several instances, like in UK,
Brazil and Iran, we have seen SARS-CoV-2 variants with greater
infectivity or virulence emerge and drive a new wave. This meant that
India had to be ready for wave 2, potentially driven by a more
infectious or virulent strain. It is in this regard the Health Ministry
largely failed in it is messaging and warning of the public. However,
nations do not fail or succeed based on their leadership alone. A much
bigger part is played by the people’s social responsibility, deep state,
and institutions. Modern H have been strikingly weak on each of these
counts, especially when compared to the East Asians. At the times of
non-crisis, the accumulated civilizational capital of the H nation could
take them through, but any discerning observer knows that this could
break in bad times.

Those bad times came with the entirely expected wave 2. While wave 2 was
expected, the above H weaknesses poured more ghee into it, making it a
conflagration of sa Devaḥ (The god). In our opinion, there were several
deep failures beyond the Health Ministry’s negligence regarding the
imminence of wave 2: 1) The people acted as though it was back to
normal. There was no masking or social distancing, crowding at indoor
entertainment spaces. 2) Wearing flimsy cloth or fashion masks in the
name of comfort, frequent removal of the mask to speak and interact at
close quarters, and improper use of the mask. 3) Poorly governed states
like Maharashtra and Kerala let the outbreak remain bad, offering
opportunities for the emergence and selection of new mutants. We suspect
both the B.1.351 and B1.617 variants are major drivers of wave 2. The
latter seems more infectious and clearly appears to break past any
natural immunity or that acquired during wave 1. There are reliable
reports of reinfection in wave 2 and might be cases of B1.617. 4)
Crowded election rallies with no or improper masking in certain states
and religious assemblies. While the Anti-H constituency and eventually
also the Dillīśvara tend to emphasize the last one (e.g., the Kumbha),
the data shows that massive outbreaks were building up far from the
centers of these open-air gatherings. Hence, while such crowds might
have played a role in local transmission, we do not think they were by
any means the primary factor in the explosive second wave in India. 5)
Many eligible people simply failed to take the opportunity to get
vaccinated. 6) The weak research culture (traditionally disparaged and
neglected by the rising urban middle class and in part addled with
navyonmāda) in the country meant that study of the mutants, the efficacy
of treatment, search for new drugs, epidemiology, bio-, and chemical
technology for were all not up to mark to face a crisis. 7) Unlike some
countries like the USA, India is a densely populated country where
people live in close proximity with extensive casual social interaction.
While the latter can be advantageous in some situations, in this
situation, it is a disaster, especially when people with the illness do
not self-quarantine responsibly. In the end, from all we have seen, the
biggest failure was the first point — people simply not taking the
threat seriously. Looking at the exponential phase of its growth, we can
say that the plot was probably lost between March 15-20th when the
tangent to the curve moved past
![45^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=45%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The result is an unprecedented public health crisis that the already
weak institutions cannot bear. Reports on the ground mention an unending
stream of cremations with people simply dying before they can even get
access to supplemental oxygen.

When a nation is in crisis, its enemies and haters will try to make the
most of it. With the precision of a Dutch clock, the mleccha haters from
Big Media and navyonmāda-addled occidental academia who are big
Piṇḍakānuyāyin-s (e.g., a Harvard University physician of Chinese
ancestry who is vociferous on SM) aided by their marūnmatta allies came
out like beetle-grubs from the wood-works peddling “cremation
sensationalism” (aimed at their fire-hating Abrahamistic audience who
mostly don’t know that H cremate), blaming it on H religious assemblies.
The foreign policy of the Mahāmleccha state has a simple sūtra: Weaken,
destabilize or destroy any non-pañcanetra state. To add to this, the
national religion of the current regime is navyonmāda, which has a
svabhāva-vairam with dharma and any political assembly that might even
indirectly support it. Then there is predatory American Big Pharma which
has always sought to profit off human misery (incidentally of their own
people, including the śvetatvak-s). Hence, they saw a golden opportunity
for 1) Playing the anger in the Indian middle class from the high death
toll to engineer a janakopa against the Lāṭeśvara and his court; 2) Send
a clear message to the Lāṭeśvara for being pally with their internal
arch-enemy, the Nāriṅgapuruṣa; 3) Use the opportunity to aid
dvitīyonmatta-s and navyonmatta-s by NGO channels by providing direct
“aid” bypassing the Indian government headed by the Lāṭeśvara.

They executed this program reason fairly well until today: 1) They
embargoed key ingredients for vaccine production and withheld the
AstraZeneca vaccines that they are not even using. 2) They amplified the
noise about the Indian failure via their usual Big Media outlets aided
by navyonmatta academics (e.g., the said Harvard University academic of
Cīna ancestry) to facilitate the Indian public opinion turning against
the Lāṭeśvara’s court. 3) Once the situation was desperate in the deśa,
over the current weekend, they suddenly got active and presented
themselves as saviors (much like the English during the piṇḍāri wars).
Their NSA and Secretary of State, in thinly veiled messages, talked of
“working with their friends and partners” in India. Every discerning H
knows who their friends and partners are and how much they work for the
downfall of the H. Now everyone from the above courtiers to Piṇḍaka
claimed that they would help by allowing the supply of materials to
India. However, one notable point in all this was how for most part they
(Piṇḍaka included) avoided directly mentioning the Indian government or
leaders. This shows that, like the English tyrants of the past, they are
attempting to use the dire situation to present themselves as saviors
while discrediting the Indian leadership.

But why did they relent at all, especially on a weekend when they are
normally relaxing? In part, they saw that the H in India were not buying
their first-responder messages and were seriously angry against their
blockade of material flow. Not only that, they saw that there was
widespread public opinion against their actions even among the
śvetatvak-s (barring some like the evil queen of the Śūlapuruṣa-s).
Americans of H origin were pressing on them to release the blockade. It
also appears that there was some straight-talking by the Indian NSA with
his counterpart (speculation). Consequently, Piṇḍaka changed his line
and claimed that he would open channels for raw material flow. As soon
as he announced it, his deśī sepoys in Big Tech, Big Media, tinpot think
tanks started amplifying Piṇḍaka’s announcement as a noble action of the
great savior.

We do not know what exactly happened, but definitely, something hurried
happened behind the scenes. One can never trust the Mahāmleccha —
everyone who has done so has paid dearly. Hence, one can only hope that
in this desperate situation, the Lāṭeśvara did not promise them
something that could come to bite the H and him in the rear in the near
future. This is a once-in-century pandemic, so there are bound to be
failures, but that is no excuse for being unprepared, given all the
precedence — this is analogous to the unpreparedness of the H rulers to
Shihab al-dīn over 800 years ago despite the precedence of Mahmud of
Ghazna. Some political setups will be better prepared for situations
like this, e.g., the Cīna-s, who, unlike H, need not fear “death by
democracy or judiciary” allowing them to play the long game without the
wastage of time and money on constant elections, let alone the
significant risks from the rallies \[note, we are not per say advocating
a Cīna form of government as the solution but simply stating a fact\].
One can only hope this wakes up the H to the need for a way more
comprehensive reform of the crappy “jugāḍ” mentality that they pat
themselves on the back for, along with serious and unbiased cultivation
of a more robust basic research culture. So far, the H have only
mimicked the broken western system — often importing just the navyonmāda
and marrying it with vicious regionalistic politics rather than bringing
actual research excellence from the west into their premier institutes.
This cannot change overnight, but without doing so, it is not going to
be easy to meet the challenges of the current order. An example germane
to the current situation is the modified nucleotide mRNA vaccines
deployed in the USA. This needs an extensive biochemical knowledge base
that cannot be developed without serious basic research. While along
with the journey to Mars, the mRNA vaccines could very well be among the
last great American achievements in the penumbra of their power being
eclipsed by navyonmāda, it still has shown the gulf between their
technological prowess and that of the rest of the world. While this
pandemic will resolve eventually, it will be at high human cost and also
we do not know for sure what it will leave behind. In the worst case
scenario, there will be long term health issues (e.g. neurological and
respiratory) that could hamper the work force. If the Lāṭeśvara is
overthrown by the Indian democracy, as the Piṇḍaka-śāsana wants, the
country will essentially be overtaken by agents of the mleccha-s and
marūnmatta-s and greatly decline. But then who can predict the future?

[The illustrated
Nakṣatra-sūkta](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/nakshatrani.pdf)

Towards the latter phase of the Vedic age, multiple traditions
independently composed sūkta-s that invoked the pantheon in association
with their home nakṣatra-s as part of the śrauta Nakṣatreṣṭi or related
gṛhya homa-s. Of these oldest and the most elaborate is seen in the form
of the Nakṣatra-sūkta of the Taittirīya brāhmaṇa. From the time we first
learned this in our youth, it has been a meditative experience that
compensates for the bane of urban existence — bad skies. Passing from
nakṣatra to nakṣatra, we could bring to our mind the various glorious
celestial bodies that we had been recording since the 10th year of our
life. Thus, the desire arose in us to create an illustrated
Nakṣatra-sūkta that would aid in bringing them to mind as we recited it
in an indoor urban setting. We have been making our own star maps for a
while, each with its advantages and downside. For nice vector graphics
(PDF), we decided to use the *TikZ* package for
![\\LaTeX](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CLaTeX&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The *TikZ* picture itself is generated by a script we wrote in R. The
datasets used for the astronomical bodies are:

-   Since we did not want it to be too cluttered nor stress the \\LaTeX
    compilation with memory issues, we stuck to the Bright Stars Catalog
    with about 9096 stars for plotting.
-   The stars were colored discretely using their spectral type from the
    catalog. We only include the types W (very rare), O, B, A, F, G, K,
    M and C for our palette.
-   The double stars were obtained from the Washington Double Star
    catalog and mapped on the Bright Stars Catalog.
-   The variable stars were taken from the confirmed variability record
    in the Bright Stars Catalog and supplemented with information from
    the Hipparchos survey.
-   The deep sky objects were obtained from The NGC 2000.0 Catalog and
    corrected where necessary. For galaxies, the orientation angle was
    assigned as in Stellarium. We generally plotted only the brightest
    of these, which can be seen by small telescopes (e.g. 20 x 3in
    binoculars, 3-4in refractors, 6-10in Newtonian reflectors) that we
    have used in our observing career.
-   For the Milky Way, we used a file specifying different contours that
    used to be available from old planetarium software like HNS.
-   The constellations boundaries as specified by the International
    Astronomical Union were based on the corrected version of Davenhall
    and Leggett’s catalog available via Vizier.
-   The constellation figures are based on those drawn by Hans Augusto
    Rey(ersbach) in his 1952 book “The Stars: A New Way to See Them”.

We generated the star maps by IAU constellation and mapped the nakṣatra
asterisms onto them as per the earliest Vedic traditions (when known) or
the traditional identification widely accepted by Hindus (when the Vedic
identity was unclear; see notes in PDF for details). At the end of the
sūkta we provide brief notes on the Vedic tradition of the nakṣatra-s.
One issue that came up in this process was the mapping of any given
point in the sky onto a constellation. This takes us back to the history
of the origin of modern constellations. While most of them in the
northern hemisphere have their roots in ancient cultures, the precise
boundaries are of recent vintage. The man behind that was Benjamin
Apthorp Gould (1824-1896 CE). Born in the USA, he showed precocious
mental ability and went on to become a doctoral student of Carl Gauss at
the age of 20. While with Gauss, he did considerable work advancing our
understanding of the asteroid belt. Inspired by the tradition of the
creation of detailed star catalogs championed by Gauss’s colleague Carl
Harding and student Johann Encke, Gould also went on to be one of the
most outstanding star catalogers of the age. Going to Argentina to study
the southern skies, he pioneered the use of photography in mapping the
heavens. As part of this work, he defined the constellation boundaries
for the southern constellations in 1877 CE. This was then extended by
Eugène Delporte (a prolific asteroid discoverer) for the northern
constellations under the IAU in 1930 CE. So the question is, given these
boundaries, how do we say which constellation a point in the sky belongs
to?

Nancy Roman designed a beautiful algorithm for this in 1987 CE. It goes
thus: We first need to precess the coordinates of our current epoch to
those of 1875 CE, which correspond to the epoch used by Gould when he
first defined the boundaries. We briefly describe below the algorithm
for the precession to a given epoch without going into the trigonometry
and calculus involved in arriving at it (that can be found in a textbook
on basic numerical procedures in astronomy, e.g., the freely available
textbook, Celestial Mechanics, by Professor Tatum). For simplicity
(sufficient for most purposes in terms of accuracy), we take a constant
rate of precession of the equinoctial colure as
![p=50.290966''/y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D50.290966%27%27%2Fy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e., per year. We take the inclination of the earth’s axis to be: ![I=
23^\\circ 26'
21.406''](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%3D+23%5E%5Ccirc+26%27+21.406%27%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then compute the parameters ![m,
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2C+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in degrees thus:

![m= \\frac{p}{3600}\\cos(I), \\; n=
\\frac{p}{3600}\\sin(I)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B3600%7D%5Ccos%28I%29%2C+%5C%3B+n%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B3600%7D%5Csin%28I%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Let,
![\\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the Right Ascension (celestial longitude; here taken from
![(0^\\circ,360^\\circ)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%5E%5Ccirc%2C360%5E%5Ccirc%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))and
![\\delta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be Declination (celestial latitude; here taken from
![(-90^\\circ,90^\\circ)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-90%5E%5Ccirc%2C90%5E%5Ccirc%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
of the point in the sky we wish to precess. We then compute the
corrections:

![a= m + n \\sin(\\alpha)\\tan(\\delta), \\; d= n
\\cos(\\alpha)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D+m+%2B+n+%5Csin%28%5Calpha%29%5Ctan%28%5Cdelta%29%2C+%5C%3B+d%3D+n+%5Ccos%28%5Calpha%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Let
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the signed difference in number of years between *the epoch we wish
to precess to*and the current epoch. Then we get the precessed
coordinates as:

![\\alpha_p=\\alpha+az, \\; \\delta_p= \\delta +
dz](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_p%3D%5Calpha%2Baz%2C+%5C%3B+%5Cdelta_p%3D+%5Cdelta+%2B+dz&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If ![\\alpha_p\<0, \\alpha_p= \\alpha_p +
360^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_p%3C0%2C+%5Calpha_p%3D+%5Calpha_p+%2B+360%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Having precessed the coordinates to 1875 CE using the above, we look up
the table created by Roman of just 357 rows which takes the below form:

![\\begin{tabular}{\|r\|r\|r\|l\|} \\hline RA low & RA up & DE low &
Constellation \\\\ \\hline 0.0000 & 360.0000 & 88.0000 & UMi\\\\

\\end{tabular}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Btabular%7D%7B%7Cr%7Cr%7Cr%7Cl%7C%7D+%5Chline+RA+low+%26+RA+up+%26+DE+low+%26+Constellation+%5C%5C+%5Chline+0.0000+%26+360.0000+%26+88.0000+%26+UMi%5C%5C++120.0000+%26217.5000+%2686.5000+%26UMi%5C%5C+315.0000+%26345.0000%26+86.1667+%26+UMi%5C%5C+270.0000+%26315.0000+%2686.0000+%26+UMi%5C%5C+0.0000+%26120.0000+%2685.0000+%26Cep%5C%5C+137.5005+%26160.0005+%2682.0000+%26+Cam%5C%5C+%5Chline+%5Cend%7Btabular%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The lookup procedure goes thus:  
1) Read down the DE low column until you get a declination lower than or
equal to the declination of your point.  
2) Move to the corresponding RA up column and read down until you get a
right ascension higher than that of your point.  
3) Move to the corresponding RA low column and read down until you get a
right ascension lower than or equal to that of your point.  
4) Check the corresponding RA up column and see if it is higher than the
right ascension of your point. If yes, the constellation column gives
the constellation in which the point lies. If not, go back to the first
step 1 and continue downward in the DE low column from the first DE you
obtained lower than or equal to that of your point to find the next such
value and repeat the following steps until the condition in the final
step is met.  
Thus, we can obtain the constellation of any celestial object given its
coordinates.

Even before we had become acquainted with the trigonometric sum and
difference formulae or calculus are father had pointed to us that there
was an optimal point at which one should stand to observe or photograph
features on vertical structures, like on a tall gopura of a temple or a
tree. That point can be calculated precisely with a simple Euclidean
construction. Hence, we were rather charmed when we encountered this
question in a German book on historical problems in mathematics. It was
posed in 1471 CE by Johannes Germanus Regiomontanus to a certain
professor Roderus of Erfurt (Figure 1): At what point on the \[flat
ground\] does a perpendicularly suspended rod appear the largest (i.e.
subtends the largest angle)? Let the rod be of length
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and it is suspended perpendicularly at height
![h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the ground. The question is then to find the point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at which
![\\angle\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would be the largest. This is also the kind of question that often
repeated itself in some form in the lower calculus section of our
university entrance exams. So it is not a difficult or unusual problem,
but it has a degree of historical significance. Before we look into its
solution, let us first talk a little about its proposer, who as an
enormously important but not widely known figure in the history of
science and mathematics in the neo-Occident.

**Figure 1. The rod of Regiomontanus**

Born in 1436 CE at Unfinden, in what is today Germany, Regiomontanus
seems to have shown signs of early genius. Seeing this, his parents sent
him at age 12 to Leipzig for formal studies and then he proceeded to
Vienna to obtain a Bachelor’s degree at age 15. His genius came to the
notice of Georg von Peurbach, a German astrologer, who wished to produce
a corrected and updated translation of the Mathematike Syntaxis
(Almagest via Arabic) by the great Greco-Roman astrologer and
mathematician Klaudios Ptolemaios of Egypt. He hoped in the process to
establish the geocentric theory on a firm footing and use the newly
introduced Hindu decimal notation for the ease of calculations. However,
von Peurbach’s Greek was not up to the mark to effectively translate the
original but he transmitted his mathematical and astrological knowledge
to Regiomontanus, whom he treated as his adopted son, before his death
at age 38. On von Peurbach’s deathbed, Regiomontanus promised to
continue his work on the Syntaxis and also create a synthesis of the
mathematical knowledge that was present in it with the new knowledge of
the Hindus and the Arabic neo-Platonic revolution that was entering
Europe from the Mohammedan lands.

The Regiomontanus took up the task with great diligence by mastering the
Greek language and started composing verse in it. He then took to
traveling around Greece and Italy collecting Greek and Latin manuscripts
collection to revive the lost knowledge of the ancients. In the process,
he found a manuscript of the yavana Diophantus that he could now handle
using the elements of Hindu bījagaṇita transmitted to Europe from the
Mohammedans. He then became the court astrologer of the Hungarian lord
Matthias Corvinus Hunyadi who staved off the further penetration of
Europe by Mehmed-II, the conqueror of Constantinople, through several
campaigns. As a ruler with literary interests, he had looted several
manuscripts from Turkish collections in course of his successful raids.
These offered additional opportunities for the studies of Regiomontanus.
Having established an observatory in Hungary for Matthias, he returned
to Germany and built an observatory equipped with some of the best
instruments of the age and also adopted the newly introduced printing
technology to start his own press. As a result, he published a widely
used ephemerides with positions of all visible solar system bodies from
1475 to 1506 CE. He also published a remarkable geometric work titled
“De Triangulis Omnimodis (On triangles of every kind)” wherein, among
other things, he introduced the Hindu trigonometric tradition to Europe.
To my knowledge, it also contains the first clear European presentation
of the sine rule and a certain version of the cos rule for triangles.
Regiomontanus also recovered and published the striking Latin work
“Astronomica” of the nearly forgotten heathen Roman astrologer Marcus
Manilius from the time of the Caesar Augustus. This beautifully poetic
work would be of interest to a student of heathen religious traditions
and Hindu belief systems because neo-Hindu astrology was after all
seriously influenced in its belief structure of the Classical world. As
a sample, we leave some lines of old Manilius here:

*impensius ipsa*  
*scire iuuat magni penitus praecordia mundi,*  
*quaque regat generetque suis animalia signis*  
*cernere et in numerum Phoebo modulante referre.* (1.16–19)  
It is more pleasing to know in depth the very heart of the universe and
to see  
how it governs and brings forth living beings by means of its signs and
to speak  
of it in verse, with Phoebus \[Apollon\] providing the tune.  
-translated from the original Latin by Volk

Two years after the publication of his ephemerides, Regiomontanus was
summoned to Rome to help the Vatican correct its calendar. He died
mysteriously at the age of 40 while in Rome. His fellow astrologers
believed it was prognosticated by a bright comet that appeared in the
sky in 1476 CE. Others state that he was poisoned by the sons of the
yavana Georgios Trapezuntios, whom he had met during his
manuscriptological peregrinations. He had a kerfuffle with Trapezuntios
after calling him a blabberer for his incorrect understanding of
Ptolemaios and apparently the latter’s sons had their revenge when he
was visiting Rome. Thus, like his friend von Peurbach, Regiomontanus
died before he could see the published copy of his work on the Syntaxis.
However, it was posthumously published as the “Epitome of the Almagest”
in 1496 CE, 20 years after his demise in Rome. Looking at this book, one
is struck by the quality of its production and the striking synergy of
its text and lavish mathematical illustrations. Even today, with the
modern computer languages like
![\\LaTeX](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CLaTeX&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(TikZ included) and
![GeoGebra](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=GeoGebra&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and our collection of digital fonts one would be hard-pressed to produce
something nearing the quality of Regiomontanus’ masterpiece published at
the dawn of the Gutenberg printing revolution.

**Figure 2. A yavana and a śūlapuruṣa in anachronistic conversation: The
frontispiece of Regiomontanus’ Epitome of the Almagest showing him
questioning Ptolemaios under the celestial sphere.**

Regiomontanus is said to have had a lot more material to write and
publish that never saw the light due to his unexpected death. One of
these was the possibility of the motion of the earth and
heliocentricity. In this regard, we know that he criticized astrologers
of the age for accepting the Ptolemaic model as a given without further
analysis. Moreover, he demonstrated that his own astronomical
observations contradicted predictions made by the geocentric models of
the time. We are also left with tantalizing material reported by his
successor Schöner that hint that he was converging on the movement of
the Earth around the sun. After Regiomontanus had passed away, the young
German mathematician Georg Joachim Rhäticus deeply studied the former’s
works to become a leading exponent of trigonometry in Europe. He
befriended the much older Polish astronomer Copernicus and taught the
latter geometry using the “De Triangulis Omnimodis” of Regiomontanus, a
copy of which with Copernicus’ marginal notes still survives. Rhäticus
also urged Copernicus to publish the heliocentric theory. This raises
the possibility that Rhäticus was aware of Regiomontanus’s ideas in this
regard and it helped crystallize Copernicus’s own similar views. In the
least, the geometric devices that both Copernicus and later Tycho Brahe
needed for their work were derived from Regiomontanus, making him a
pivotal figure in the emergence of science in the neo-Occident. \[This
sketch of his biography is based on: *Leben und Wirken des Johannes
Müller von Königsberg* by E. Zinner\]

**Figure 3. Construction to solve the Regiomontanus problem.**

Returning to his problem, we can game it thus (Figure 3): The rod of
length
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
suspended perpendicularly at height
![h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
subtends the
![\\angle\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at the ground. This angle can be written as the difference of two
angles: ![\\angle\\theta
=\\angle\\alpha-\\angle\\beta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Ctheta+%3D%5Cangle%5Calpha-%5Cangle%5Cbeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Let the distance of the point on the ground from the foot of the
perpendicular suspension of the rod be
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can write the tangent difference formula for the above angles using
Figure 3 as:

![\\tan(\\theta)=\\tan(\\alpha-\\beta)=
\\dfrac{\\tan(\\alpha)-\\tan(\\beta)}{1+\\tan(\\alpha)\\tan(\\beta)}=
\\dfrac{\\dfrac{a+h}{x}-\\dfrac{h}{x}}{\\dfrac{x^2+h(a+h)}{x^2}}=\\dfrac{ax}{x^2+h(a+h)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctan%28%5Ctheta%29%3D%5Ctan%28%5Calpha-%5Cbeta%29%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctan%28%5Calpha%29-%5Ctan%28%5Cbeta%29%7D%7B1%2B%5Ctan%28%5Calpha%29%5Ctan%28%5Cbeta%29%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cdfrac%7Ba%2Bh%7D%7Bx%7D-%5Cdfrac%7Bh%7D%7Bx%7D%7D%7B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E2%2Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D%7Bx%5E2%7D%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bax%7D%7Bx%5E2%2Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can see from Figure 3 that as the point on the ground moves towards
the foot of the suspension, both ![\\angle\\alpha, \\angle\\beta \\to
90^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Calpha%2C+%5Cangle%5Cbeta+%5Cto+90%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
thus ![\\angle\\theta \\to
0^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Ctheta+%5Cto+0%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If the point on the ground moves away from the foot of the suspension,
both ![\\angle\\alpha, \\angle\\beta \\to
0^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Calpha%2C+%5Cangle%5Cbeta+%5Cto+0%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and again ![\\angle\\theta \\to
0^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%5Ctheta+%5Cto+0%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, somewhere in between, we will have the maximum
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and it will be in the interval
![\[0^\\circ,90^\\circ\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%5E%5Ccirc%2C90%5E%5Ccirc%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In this interval, the tangent increases as the angle increases. Thus, it
will reach a maximum when the function
![y=\\tfrac{ax}{x^2+h(a+h)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bax%7D%7Bx%5E2%2Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
reaches a maximum. We would find this maximum by differentiating this
function and finding where
![\\tfrac{dy}{dx}=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdx%7D%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This approach, using calculus, is how we would have answered this
question in our university entrance exam. One will observe that this
function has a rather flat maximum suggesting that, for the purposes of
viewing a feature on a tall vertical object, a relatively approximate
position would suffice. While this principle of extreme value
determination by calculus was known in the Hindu mathematical tradition
by at least the time of ācārya Bhāskara-II (1100s of CE), there is no
evidence that any of this Hindu knowledge of calculus was transmitted to
Regiomontanus. In Europe, a comparable extreme value principle was
informally discovered much later by the French mathematician Michel
Rolle in 1691 CE who actually rejected differential calculus. So how
would Regiomontanus have solved in 1471 CE?

It is believed that he used the logic of the reciprocal. When
![y=\\tfrac{ax}{x^2+h(a+h)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bax%7D%7Bx%5E2%2Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is maximum its reciprocal
![y=\\tfrac{x}{a}+\\tfrac{h(a+h)}{ax}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7Ba%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D%7Bax%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would be minimum. We can see that if
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes large, then
![\\tfrac{x}{a}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7Ba%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
term would dominate and it would grow in size. Similarly, when
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes small, the
![\\tfrac{h(a+h)}{ax}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D%7Bax%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will dominate and it would grow in size. The 2 opposing growths would
balance when
![\\tfrac{x}{a}=\\tfrac{h(a+h)}{ax}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7Ba%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D%7Bax%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This yields
![x=\\sqrt{h(a+h)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Csqrt%7Bh%28a%2Bh%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With this in hand, we can easily use the geometric mean theorem in a
construction to obtain the desired point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3). This also yields another geometric relationship realized by
the yavana-s of yore regarding the intersection of the tangent at point
P on a circle and a line perpendicular to it that cuts a chord (here
defined by the suspended rod) on that circle: The distance of the point
of tangency
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from its intersection with the line containing the said chord is the
geometric mean of the distances of their intersection to the two ends of
the chord.

We may conclude with some brief observations on the history of science.
Regiomontanus is a rather striking example of how the founder of a
scientific revolution can be quite forgotten by the casual student due
to the dazzling success of his successors. In the process, the existence
of scientific continuity between the Ptolemaic system and the
heliocentric successor might also be missed by the casual student. His
life also provides the link between the popularization of the Hindu
decimal notation in the Occident by Fibonacci and the birth of science
in those regions by the introduction of Greek and Hindu tradition via
the Arabic intermediate. While Hindu astrology was influenced by the
Classical astrological tradition there is no evidence that the Ptolemaic
system ever reached India. The Hindus instead developed their own
astronomical tradition that appears to have rather early on used a
potentially heliocentric system of calculation culminating in the work
of ācārya Āryabhaṭa-I, who also discovered a rather brilliant algebraic
approximation for the sine function. However, soon there was a reversal
to a geostationary, giant-earth model under Brahmagupta, the rival of
the Āryabhaṭa school. In the realm of astronomy, the totality of these
developments resulted in epicyclic systems or eccentric systems that
paralleled the Occidental models in several ways. On the mathematical
side, it spawned many high points, such as in trigonometry, ultimately
resulting in the emergence of an early form of differential calculus by
the time of Mañjula that was subsequently advanced by Bhāskara-II. This
line of investigation culminated in the works of the Nambūtiri-s in the
Cera country with the emergence of what could be termed full-fledged
calculus. Remarkably, this was paralleled by the revisiting of
Āryabhaṭa-I and the move towards heliocentric models by the great
Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin. Partial heliocentric models for at least the inner
planets, along with the prediction of the Venereal transit of the sun
was also achieved by Kamalākara, a Mahārāṣṭrī brāhmaṇa, in the 1600s.
Notably, only the earlier phase of the Hindu trigonometric tradition was
transmitted to the Occident at the time of Regiomontanus. None of the
Hindu studies towards calculus found their way there and they appear to
have been rediscovered in the Occident about 2 centuries after
Regiomontanus. Despite possessing a mathematical and astronomical edge,
in the centuries following Nīlakaṇṭha, the Hindu schools, facing a
dilution from the chokehold of the Mohammedan incubus, did not spawn a
scientific upheaval of the order that took place in Europe in the
centuries following Regiomontanus.

Recently my friend brought it to my attention that C. Radhakrishna Rao
had scored a century. Born in 1920 CE to Doraswamy Nayadu and A.
Laxmikanthamma from the Andhra country, he is one of the great
mathematical thinkers and statisticians of our age. He came from a
high-performing family but even against that background he was clearly
an outlier showing early signs of mathematical genius and extraordinary
memory beyond mathematics. An example of this was seen in his youth in
an award he received for his anatomical knowledge, wherein he displayed
his perfect recall of all bones and structures of the body. He might
have been an outstanding mathematician but the lack of opportunities to
pursue research in India or elsewhere during WW2 led him to going to
ISI, Kolkata and becoming a statistician. By the age 20, he was doing
and publishing his research by himself and eventually was awarded a PhD
for his pioneering statistical work on biometrics at the Cambridge
University with Ronald Fisher as his supervisor. By the age 28, he was a
professor who had authored several works at the frontier of statistics.
Over his 100 years he has been prolific and actively publishing into
this advanced years — an outlier in every sense — a truly rare genetic
configuration.

CR Rao wrote a very accessible book for a lay audience titled
*Statistics and truth: putting chance to work*. This small book provides
a great introduction to the utility and the consequences of well-founded
numerical and probabilistic thinking with examples from diverse
sciences. We found the book particularly attractive because, despite
being a mathematical layman, we stumbled onto the probabilistic view of
existence around the 15th year of our life. Rao’s book then lent proper
shape to our thoughts that had been born from several experiments and
explorations. To us, the probabilistic view is the fructification of an
ancient strand of Hindu thought first articulated in a ṛk from the
pathetic sūkta of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa (RV10.34.8):

tripañcāśaḥ krīḻati vrāta eṣāṃ  
deva iva savitā satyadharmā ।  
ugrasya cin manyave nā namante  
rājā cid ebhyo nama it kṛṇoti ॥

Three times fifty plays the swarm of these,  
like the god Savitṛ of true laws.  
To the fury of even the fierce they bow not ;  
even the king verily makes his bow to them.

The ṛk is referring to the game of chance, apparently one of the
favorite games of the old Ārya-s played with vibhīdaka/vibhītaka nuts.
Rao’s essays inspired us to explore the basic numerical aspects of this
game at the end of junior college (Also the time we were studying the RV
and AV). We present a freshly illustrated version of that here for other
simple-minded folks. The game may be reconstructed thus: A hole was dug
in the ground and 150 nuts were thrown into it. Then the player drew a
handful of those to get out
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
nuts (probably there were some constraints against cheating by drawing
just 4 nuts that are not entirely clear. A possible alternative
formulation involves casting the 150 nuts towards the hole and only
those
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that fell into the hole were considered for the ensuing operation). If
![n\\mod 4 \\equiv
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cmod+4+%5Cequiv+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then it was a Kṛta (K) or the best result. The next 3 successively lower
ranked results were ![n\\mod 4 \\equiv
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cmod+4+%5Cequiv+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
a Treta (T); ![n\\mod 4 \\equiv
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cmod+4+%5Cequiv+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
a Dvāpara (D); ![n\\mod 4 \\equiv
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cmod+4+%5Cequiv+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
a Kali (L). It is unclear if the results were named for the 4 yuga-s or
vice versa. In our childhood, our grandmother played this game with us
albeit with tamarind seeds she had saved after peeling off the fruit. We
manually worked out the number of different combinations (hence, order
does not matter) formed from the 4 types of results (K, T, D, L) that
can be seen in 1, 2, 3… successive draws: in 1 draw you can have K, T, D
or L ![\\to
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
possible combinations. In 2 draws you can have: KK, KT, KL, KD, TT, TD,
TL, DD, DL or LL ![\\to
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
possible combinations. So on. The sequence of the number of possible
combinations goes as: 4, 10, 20, 35… This gave us an introduction to
some the principles of combinatorics that only later in life we learned
to be governed by the multinomial theorem:  
Kṛta, Treta, Dvāpara, Kali ![\\mapsto
m=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmapsto+m%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![n=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
successive draws; hence, the total number of possible combinations in
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
successive draws is:

![N={{n+m-1} \\choose
{m-1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D%7B%7Bn%2Bm-1%7D+%5Cchoose+%7Bm-1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We wondered about the precise chance of getting a combination in
consecutive set of draws. We finally understood this only upon
apprehending the multinomial theorem. This allowed us to compute say,
the chance of getting 4 kṛta-s in 4 consecutive draws as
![\\tfrac{4!}{4!\\cdot 0! \\cdot 0! \\cdot 0!}\\cdot
\\tfrac{1}{256}=0.00390625](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B4%21%7D%7B4%21%5Ccdot+0%21+%5Ccdot+0%21+%5Ccdot+0%21%7D%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B256%7D%3D0.00390625&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is pretty low. On the other end the chance of get all the 4
results in 4 consecutive draws, i.e. KTDL, is much higher:
![\\tfrac{4!}{1!\\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!}\\cdot
\\tfrac{1}{256}=\\tfrac{3}{32}=0.09375](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B4%21%7D%7B1%21%5Ccdot+1%21+%5Ccdot+1%21+%5Ccdot+1%21%7D%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B256%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B32%7D%3D0.09375&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since the vibhīdaka game was for gambling, we can assign the scores from
4 for K to 1 for L and measure ones cumulative gains over multiple
draws. We asked, for example, in 4 successive draws what will be
distribution of scores (Figure 1) — what score will one have the highest
chance of obtaining. We can see that the scores will be distributed
between between 4 (LLLL) to 16 (KKKK). We had intuitively realized in
our childhood that one had the greatest chance of of having the midpoint
score of 10. With the multinomial distribution we could calculate the
precise probability of getting the score 10 as 0.171875. This gave us a
good feel for the multinomial distribution and how we could get a
central tendency in terms of the most probable consequence (score) even
multiple scores had the same number of generating combinations (first vs
second panel).

1.** The number of distinct combinations and probabilities of getting a
given score in 4 draws.

Thus, we can reach any integer by the sum of the scores in a certain
number of draws (order does not matter as only the sum matters). The
draws resulting in scores adding to the first few integers are shown in
Table 1.  
Table 1

| Integer | Draws                                                              | Number |

Inspired by Hofstadter, after some trial and error, we were able to
formulate an alternating recursion formula to obtain this sequence of
the total number of ways of reaching an integer as a sum of integers
from 1..4. We first manually compute the first 4 entries as above. Then
the odd terms are given by the recursion:  
![f\[n\]=f\[n-3\]+f\[n-1\]-f\[n-4\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-3%5D%2Bf%5Bn-1%5D-f%5Bn-4%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
The even terms are given by:  
![f\[n\]=f\[n-3\]+f\[n-1\]-f\[n-4\]+\\left
\\lfloor\\tfrac{n}{4}-1\\right\\rfloor+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-3%5D%2Bf%5Bn-1%5D-f%5Bn-4%5D%2B%5Cleft+%5Clfloor%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B4%7D-1%5Cright%5Crfloor%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![\\lfloor x
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the floor function or first integer ![\\le
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, we have ![\\mathbf{f: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 15, 18, 23, 27, 34,
39, 47, 54, 64, 72, 84, 94, 108
\\cdots}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7Bf%3A+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+6%2C+9%2C+11%2C+15%2C+18%2C+23%2C+27%2C+34%2C+39%2C+47%2C+54%2C+64%2C+72%2C+84%2C+94%2C+108+%5Ccdots%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We also devised an alternative algorithm that is well suited for a
computer to extract this sequence. This algorithm revealed a close
relationship between this sequence and geometry of triangles.
Effectively, the above sequence
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gives the total number of integer triangles that have perimeter ![P \\le
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for ![n \\in 4, 5, 6
\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cin+4%2C+5%2C+6+%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, for
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can have only 1 integer triangle,
![1-1-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-1-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
that has ![P \\le
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For ![P \\le
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have 2 triangles ![(1-1-1,
1-2-2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-1-1%2C+1-2-2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and so on (Figure 1, Table 2). Since the smallest integer triangle has
![P=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can get the 0th term of
![f\[0\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B0%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then we can state that
![f\[P-3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5BP-3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
provides the number of integer triangles with ![P \\le n; n=3, 4, 5
\\cdots
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+n%3B+n%3D3%2C+4%2C+5+%5Ccdots+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

**[![vibhIdaka_tri01](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/vibhidaka_tri01.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/vibhidaka_tri01.png)Figure
2.** First 18 integer triangles

Figure 1 shows the first 18 integer triangles, i.e. those with ![P \\le
12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One immediately notices that in this set the isosceles triangles
dominate (Table 2). Of these every
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divisible by 3 will yield one equilateral triangle; thus equilateral
triangles are the most common repeating type of triangle. There are only
3 scalene triangles in the first 18 integer triangles of which one is
the famous
![3-4-5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3-4-5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
right triangle, which is also the first Brahmagupta triangle (integer
triangles with successive sides differing by 1 and integer area). We
first computed the the number of triangles with ![P \\le
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that are isosceles. This sequence goes as:

![\\mathbf{f_i: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 21, 25, 28, 32, 36,
41, 45, 50, 55, 61, 66, 72, 78
\\cdots}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7Bf_i%3A+1%2C+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+6%2C+8%2C+10%2C+13%2C+15%2C+18%2C+21%2C+25%2C+28%2C+32%2C+36%2C+41%2C+45%2C+50%2C+55%2C+61%2C+66%2C+72%2C+78+%5Ccdots%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Strikingly, every alternate term in this sequence from the second term
onward is a triangular number, i.e. the sum of integers from ![1\\cdots
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Ccdots+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The terms between them are the integer midpoints between successive
triangular numbers. This understanding helps us derive a formula for
this sequence:

![f\[n\]=\\left \\lceil \\frac{n^2}{8}
\\right\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D%5Cleft+%5Clceil+%5Cfrac%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B8%7D+%5Cright%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here the ![\\left \\lceil x
\\right\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft+%5Clceil+x+%5Cright%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function is the rounding up function, wherein if
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is an integer ![\\left \\lceil k+ \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor
=k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft+%5Clceil+k%2B+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%5Crfloor+%3Dk%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the rest are rounded to the nearest integer.

Remarkably, we find that the first scalene triangle appears at
![P=9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and then scales exactly as
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but with an offset of 9. Thus, the number of scalene triangle with ![P
\\le n=
f\[P-9\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+n%3D+f%5BP-9%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The sequence
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scales approximately as a polynomial with positive cubic and square
terms, whereas the number of isosceles triangles with ![P \\le
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%5Cle+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scales as ![\\left \\lceil \\tfrac{n^2}{8}
\\right\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft+%5Clceil+%5Ctfrac%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B8%7D+%5Cright%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, even though the isosceles triangles are dominant at low
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
they will become increasingly rare (Table 2) and their fraction of the
total number of triangles will tend to 0.

We can also look at the largest angle of the integer triangles (Figure
2). These are plotted along the arc of the unit circle defined by them
and scaled and colored as per their frequency of occurrence. As noted
above, every third perimeter will define an equilateral triangle. This
will result in the smallest of these angles
![\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) =
60^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+60%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being the most common. The zone exclusion in its vicinity shows that one
needs large sides to approximate the equilateral triangles (e.g. the
bigger Brahmagupta triangles). Beyond these, other major angles that are
repeatedly observed are: ![\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right) =
75.52^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+75.52%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);

![\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{8}\\right) =
82.83^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+82.83%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\right) =
70.53^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+70.53%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, the common version of the
![\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{4}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle arises whenever the perimeter ![P= 5k; k=1,2,3
\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D+5k%3B+k%3D1%2C2%2C3+%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, these are all versions of the
![1-2-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-2-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. However, rare scalene versions can arise, for example, in the
form of the
![6-7-8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6-7-8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle and its higher homologs. Apart from the trivial equilateral
triangles, 2 other integer rational sector triangles, the right or
![90^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=90%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(bhujā-koṭi-karṇa triples) and the
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles (e.g. ![3-5-7,
P=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3-5-7%2C+P%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
appear repeatedly with a lower frequency defined by their
[triple-generating
equations](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/12/01/some-notes-on-rational-sector-triangle-triples/).

Finally, this search of integer triangles also provides a mean to
construct triangles, one of whose angles are approximately a radian
(Figure 3). In first 511 triangles, ![(P\\le

![1.0003^c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1.0003%5Ec&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The above observations gave us useful introductory lesson on the path to
statistical mechanics. Let us consider the isosceles triangles as
representing great order (because the is less freedom in their sides)
and the scalene triangles as representing greater disorder (more freedom
in their sides). A simple multinomial derived score results in the
proportion of the order configurations decreasing over time (more
draws), i.e. disorder dominates, resembling entropy in the physical
world. Among the more “ordered” states the dominant one tends to be that
which is in the most “central” configuration, i.e. the equilateral
triangle. Finally, certain peculiar configurations can repeatedly emerge
if they happen to have special [generating
equations](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/12/01/some-notes-on-rational-sector-triangle-triples/)
like the
![90^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=90%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles.

Consider a 3D function
![z=f(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Df%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now evaluate it at each point of a ![n \\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
integer lattice grid. Compute ![z \\mod
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%5Cmod+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to each point and plot it as a color defined by some
palette that suits your aesthetic. The consequence is a what we term the
“modulo rug”.  
For example, below is a plot of
![z=x^2+y^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dx%5E2%2By%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

We get a pattern of circles around a central circular system reminiscent
of ogdoadic arrangements in various Hindu maṇḍala-s. From the aesthetic
viewpoint, the best modulo rugs are obtained with symmetric functions
higher even powers — this translates into some pleasing symmetry in the
rug. Several examples of such are shown below.

All the above
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are composite numbers. Accordingly, there is some repetitiveness in the
structure. However, if
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a prime then we have the greatest complexity in the rug. One example
of such is plotted below.

Coprimality, i.e., the situation where the GCD of 2 integers is 1 is one
of the fundamental expressions of complexity. In that situation, two
numbers can never contain the other within themselves or in multiples of
them by numbers smaller than the other. In other words, their LCM is the
product of the 2 numbers. There are numerous geometric expressions of
this complexity inherent in coprime numbers. One way to illustrate it is
by the below class of parametric curves defined by trigonometric
functions:

![x=a_1\\cos(c_1t+k_1)+a_2\\cos(c_2t+k_2)\\\\\[5pt\]
y=b_1\\sin(c_3t+k_3)+b_2\\sin(c_4t+k_4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Da_1%5Ccos%28c_1t%2Bk_1%29%2Ba_2%5Ccos%28c_2t%2Bk_2%29%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+y%3Db_1%5Csin%28c_3t%2Bk_3%29%2Bb_2%5Csin%28c_4t%2Bk_4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The human mind perceives symmetry and certain optimal complexity as the
hallmarks of aesthetics. Hence, we adopt the following conditions:  
1) ![a_1, a_2, b_1,
b_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+b_1%2C+b_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are in the range
![\\tfrac{3}{14}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B14%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)..1
for purely aesthetic considerations.  
2) ![k_1, k_2, k_3,
k_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1%2C+k_2%2C+k_3%2C+k_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are orthogonal rotation angles that are in the range ![\[0,
2\\pi\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C+2%5Cpi%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
3)
![c_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
for aesthetic purposes relating to optimal complexity, is an integer in
the range
![\[5,60\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B5%2C60%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
4)
![c_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
captures the role of coprimality in complexity. It coprime with
![c_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and is in the range
![\[40,141\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B40%2C141%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
5) ![c_3 =
\|c_1-c_2\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_3+%3D+%7Cc_1-c_2%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
6)
![c_4=c_1+c_2-c_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_4%3Dc_1%2Bc_2-c_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
The last two conditions are for making the curve bilaterally symmetric —
an important aesthetic consideration.

The result is curves with a guilloche-like form. For the actual
rendering, they are run thrice with different colors and slightly
different scales to give a reasonable aesthetic. Our program randomly
samples through the above conditions and plots the corresponding curves.
Below are 25 of them.

This note is part biographical and part survey of the major geopolitical
abstractions that may be gleaned from the events in the past 21 years.
Perhaps, there is nothing much of substance in this note but an
uninformed Hindu might find a sketch of key concepts required for his
analysis of geopolitics as it current stands. The biggest players in
geopolitics are necessarily dangerous entities; hence, things will be in
part stated in parokṣa — this goes well with the observation in our
tradition that the gods like parokṣa.

In closing days of 1999 CE, we had our first intersection with Samuel
Huntington and his hypothesis of the clash of civilizations. We found
the presentation very absorbing because it lent a shape to several
inferences, we had accumulated over the years both in Bhārata and on the
shores of the Mahāmleccha land. The firsthand experience on shores of
the Mahāmlecchadeśa was very important for there is no substitute to
fieldwork in anthropology — it enabled a direct interaction with the
various denizens of the land and allowed us, for the first time, to
extract precise knowledge of their ways and attitudes. A key concept
articulated Huntington was “the clash of civilizations”, the title of
his book. This is a central concept on which all geopolitical analysis
rests. However, we parsed it as a network wherein the nodes are
civilizations and not all edges have the same nature or valence (Figure
1). Since the closing days of the Neolithic, the core of the
civilizational network (at least in the Old World to start with) has
been rather dense. Further, the civilizational network is dynamic both
in terms of its nodes and edges. Some civilizational nodes decline or
become extinct over time taking away the edges that were connected to
them (dashed lines in Figure 1). The edges themselves might change from
agonistic (shown as light cadet blue arrows in Figure 1) to antagonistic
(shown as red inhibitory edges) ones or vice versa over time. Some edges
might be complex and cannot be easily characterized (with no heads, e.g.
the “Galtonian” edges in green linking the Anglospheric powers to
China). The characterization of the edges might also vary from the
viewpoint of the pakṣa of the characterizer. Regarding that last point,
the characterization presented here is with limits reasonably predictive
and useful from the Hindu standpoint.

So, how does basic clash of civilization articulated by Huntington play
out in the framework of this civilizational network? The simplest thing
is to look at the flux at a given node. This is a sum of the “weights”
of the edges coming into that node. Thus, it is easy is to perceive that
the Hindu civilization is currently a node with notable negative flux —
this immediately indicates that it is node at the adverse receiving end
of the clash of civilizations.

**Some literature**  
Since Huntington’s publication several disparate works have been
published or translated that have a bearing on the Hindu construction of
a geopolitical world view. We just outline a few below:  
• Amy Chua, an academic of Chinese ancestry, published a work
illustrating the role of strongly coherent minorities with high human
capital relative to their host populations in civilizational clashes,
especially the destruction of states and in some cases civilizations
from within. One dynamic she highlighted relates to the Occidental itch
to bring “democracy” to states containing such minorities. We may add
that sometimes what comes in the name of “democracy” is in reality a
“gift-wrapped” strain of the Marxian doctrine. This democratization or
Marxian liberalization allows the under-performing “masses”, full of
resentment against the over-performing minorities, to get back at them
often resulting in intra-national civilizational clashes. If the
over-performing minority was the cause for holding the nation together
and/or its productivity, it results in national collapse upon their
defeat or expulsion. In other cases, is festers as a long-term conflict
following the Huntingtonian dynamics. The objective of the enemies of
the Hindus is to make this dynamic play out on the brāhmaṇa-s.

• The translation and the publication of the English works of the German
academic Jan Assmann helped introduce important terms such as
“counter-religions”. While he originally introduced it to understand the
rise of the ekarākṣasonmāda-s of West Asia, it also serves as an
excellent framework to describe the emergence of subversive religious
movements in the Indo-Iranian sphere. The first such, which seems to
have marked a schism within the Indo-Iranian tradition, was the
counter-religion promulgated by Zarathustra. On the Indo-Aryan side, a
cluster of such movements occurred nearly 2500 years ago culminating in
the counter-religions of the Tathāgatha, the Nirgrantha and the Maskarin
of the cowshed. Subsequently, we had a near counter-religious movement
in the form of the Mahānubhāva upheaval, which contributed to the
weakening of the Hindu resistance to the Army of Islam. Few centuries
later, similar memes and the half-digested ekarākṣasonmāda eventually
resulted in the subversion of the pāñcanadīya saṃpradāya into the
uśnīśamoha. The other term Assmann introduced was the “Mosaic
distinction” that helps explain the vidharma tendencies in
counter-religions, especially ekarākṣasonmāda.

• The mūlavātūla indologist Sheldon Pollock published a work on the
history of Indian tradition. While recognizing the positive and enormous
influence of the Sanskrit cosmopolis, Pollock tried to subtly sneak in
the navyonmāda framework into Hindu studies. Along with this, he
provided the foundation for the powerful American indological school to
present a late date for the rise of Sanskrit as a medium of Hindu
expression. This helped create the idea of a non-existent Sanskritic
Hindu civilization before the common era (Sanskrit was just some hidden
language used in the sacred texts of brāhmaṇa-s), thus, making it
younger than the mūlavātūla and probably even the pretonmāda tradition.
Further, as per this theory, the transformation did not arise from with
the H but was probably fostered by the Iranians, perhaps with some Greek
influence. More insidiously, it opened the door for other indologists of
this school to link the dharma with their pet boogeyman, the śūlapuruṣa
movement of the 1930-40s. The importance of this sleight of the hand
will become apparent with the next item. Unfortunately, the positive
side of Pollock’s work studying the knowledge systems of the Hindu
cosmopolis should have been done by Sanskritists from our pakṣa within a
proper H framework — instead the H pakṣa took off on flogging dead
Germans and producing little positive work.

• The recent volume by Lindsay and Pluckrose probed deep into the proct
of the navyonmāda tradition that arose in the śūlapuruṣīya lands and
grew into a viṣāla-viṣa-vṛkṣa nurtured by the Phiraṅga and Mahāmleccha.
This work helps understand the roots of its arborizations in the form of
both the śākhā-s (i.e. the Freudian, e.g. Wendy Doniger, and
philological, e.g. Richard Davis) of new American indology that
subverted the tradition of the old Daniel Ingalls. Given its origins in
the conflict within the śūlapuruṣīya lands, and being a pracchannonmāda
itself, it is not surprising that one of its projects in the indological
domain is fleshing out the above-stated point of connecting dharma to
the movement of the ghātaka-netā śūlapuruṣaṇām. Additionally, it has
received nourishment from the founding lords of the Soviet Rus empire
and served to cover up their genocidal activities. It also has been
active in furthering the Maoistic strain of Galtonism (see below). It
attained ascendancy in mleccha-lands by precipitating the overthrow of
Vijaya-nāma vyāpārin and placing Piṇḍaka as the puppet mleccheśa from
behind whom their supporter, the ardhakṛṣṇā, operates. Aided by their
longstanding backer the duṣṭa Sora, they have now taken aim at the
Hindus having presented them as a movement comparable to their
archenemies of yore, the śūlapuruṣa-s.

**The conquest of the internet**  
In 1999 CE, the internet was still young and a mostly free place for
expression. It was seen as heralding a new mode of expression for
individuals who had no voice until then. But in the coming decade this
gradually declined as the principle of freedom of expression slowly
eroded. The mleccha deep-state has long sought to spy on its citizens
and the opportunity to do this came with the marūnmatta attack on the
mahāmleccha on September 11, 2001. The mleccha powers could now
institute sweeping curbs on the people in the name of protecting them.
However, this was only a bīja for the total destruction of the freedom
of expression that was to come with the takeover of the internet by the
guggulu-mukhagiri-jāka-bejhādi- duṣṭāḥ and the viṣāmbhonidhi Wikipedia.
This take over aligned with the subversion of these vyāpāra-s by the
navyonmāda. The prelude to this was seen when a servant of guggulu was
expelled for voicing his opinion. While people thought it was just an
internal company matter, it was clear that the navyonmāda was moving to
end to freedom expression. A feedback loop developed between new social
media and another major development, i.e. the ubiquity of the smart
phones. The latter made every man perpetually visible to the operatives
of the mleccha deep-state. The dangers of the reach of these duṣṭa-s
along with the mleccha deep-state was exposed by their rogue spaś
Himaguha who escaped to the khaganate of Putin. The real action was seen
in the past year in collusion with the conventional media to overthrow
the mleccharāṭ prajalpaka Vijaya and replace him with their favored man
Piṇḍaka, now provided with a court of navyonmatta-s. With that the
internet became a weapon for the navyonmatta-s who are directing its
full force at their longstanding foe, the Hindus.

**Some basic principles for the vigraha of the loka-saṃgrāma**  
• The foundations of Hindu polity lie in the actions of the deva-s in
the śruti by which they overthrew the ditija-s in battle after battle by
ūrja, māya and astrāṇi. This was translated for the human sphere by
pouring the heroes into the divine bottles in the Itihāsa-s. Finally, it
was codified by the clever Viṣṇugupta who aided the Mauryan to overthrow
the evil Nanda-s and the yavana-s. It was presented for bāla-s by the
wise Viṣṇuśarman, an acute observer and pioneer in the study of
biological conflicts. He laid out the forms of vairam. Among those is
svabhāva-vairam.

• Being ekarākṣasonmāda-s and vidharma-s (counter-religions), the
unmāda-s and dharma are locked in svabhāva-vairam — a conflict that ends
only in the extinction of one of the parties in the long run. The
ekarākṣasonmāda-s have destroyed many of our sister religions and we
remain the only remaining bulwark against them. Some object that the
Cīna-s and Uṣāputra-s are also there — so why claim that we are the
bulwark. We argue that the Cīna-s are seized by their own sādhana of
legalism (see below) that has rendered them quite weak in terms of
religion. The Uṣāputra-s, while doing well for themselves, are not a
force that can restore heathenism in the world, especially given their
currently aging and declining population. The graph in Figure 1 and
history shows that there is some truth this “viśvaguru” quality of the
H, even if it has declined over the last millennium.

• The understanding of the Chinese state in most Occidental and Indian
presentations ranges from misguided to deeply flawed. Two key concepts
are required to understand its behavior and threat potential. The first,
the doctrine of “legalism” or fa jia, whose early practitioner Lord
Shang played a notable role in the rise of the Chin — in many ways he
can be seen as the Viṣṇugupta of the Cīna-s who laid path for their
unification under Chin Shi Huang, who played the role comparable to our
Mauryan Candragupta. This doctrine, while often denied, has dominated
Cīna imperial action since. While it is a rather sophisticated system,
which is outside the scope of this note, a key feature is mutual spying
that helps keep society in check — a convergent feature with other
totalitarian systems. In it the ruler might keep the people busy with a
benign “outer coat” that keeps the imperial designs out of their sight,
or to paraphrase the neo-emperor Deng Xiaoping, they will adjust to
follow the wind blowing from the rulers. Over the ages, the Cīna
imperium has used Confucianism, Bauddham, Turkism, socialism and
westernism as the outer coats to conceal their imperial actions. This
legalism makes the Cīna-s ruthless and dangerous adversaries who are
difficult to read. Even if they might not be rākṣasonmatta-s, the
imperial focus of the system makes them hungry for land and ādhipatyam.
For this they might play a long game, slowly encroaching on land,
millimeter by millimeter and playing victim when their land-grab is
noticed. Using that confusion, they would try to settle the situation in
their favor. However, their aging population is the biggest road block
to their total victory.

• The second concept that we have laid out in these pages in some detail
is Galtonism. It describes a certain type of sinophilia that permeates
the West in a form first articulated by the English intellectual Galton.
In it, the Occidental center sees a great power in China and is almost
in awe of it from the cracking of their psychometric yardsticks such IQ,
and finds them to be of a “identifiable” fair complexion (at least the
more northern subset) and a very orderly people. Thus, in contrast to
the Hindu, they are willing to concede a global role for the Cīna-s,
despite they being heathens. Conversely, they see in the Hindu
simultaneously a defiant “other”, “an ugly people” and an idiot
incapable of playing any great global role. In fact any attempt on their
part to do so is seen as a dangerous challenge to their ekarākṣasam
undergirding that should be squelched right away. A distinct strain of
Galtonism is that seen in the navyonmatta-s (e.g. starting with their
boosterist, the naked Needham, down to duṣta-Sora): for them the Cīna
state is a culmination of their own utopian doctrine — of course they
would ignore the fact that their own implementations fail and try to
claim the genius of the Cīna-s for themselves. Thus, they play a potent
role as ready apologists for the Cīna imperium.

**In retrospect**  
Looking back, late Huntington was right in terms of the great clash
between the marūnmatta-s and mleccha-s that was to play out in his own
last years. He was also right in that the Cīna-s would ally with the
marūnmatta-s to get back at their foes. However, this did not develop
globally as the Cīna-s had their own marūnmatta terrorism, which they
recognized as an unmāda and treated as such. Hence, the Cīna-s limited
its use to India, since there was the ever-willing TSP available as a
bhṛtya who would not blow back. In the end, despite the rise of the
Khilafat under Dr. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the mahāmleccha triumphed in
this round of the conflict though their cousins in Europe might be
eventually conquered.

What Huntington did not foresee was that the battle would be brought to
the world by a new force, the navyonmāda, backed by the
sora-jāka-mukhagiryādi-duṣṭāḥ. Like Constantine seizing the Roman empire
for the pretasādhaka-s, these have placed a pliable man Piṇḍaka at the
helm surrounded by navyonmatta-s. This war has already reached the
Hindus. It will ally with the Cīna-s and the marūnmatta-s against their
common foes. In an extreme scenario it might provide the final
bridgehead the marūnmatta-s need for their conquest of mleccha lands.

The Cīna-s and marūnmatta-s have a degree of immunity to the
navyonmatta-s. That is in part because the former have sealed off their
internet and created their own parallel world like that of Viśvāmitra
for Triśaṅku. The marūnmatta doctrine is a superior,
fecundity-supporting version of the navyonmāda; hence, it is going to be
hard to breach. In the long run the dynamics of navyonmāda are unclear
due its contra-reproductive strategies. However, in the short run it
could wreak havoc on the Hindus, especially their elite, who seem to be
particularly susceptible to this disease. Going forward, at least for
the next several years, models of all the older conflicts in geopolitics
have to be updated to account for the role navyonmāda will play.
Whatever the case, as far as H go, it will ally with the other unmāda-s
against them. It will also split the mūlavātūla-s into pro- and anti-
camps, a dynamic that might cause some instability to it.

As Vidrum was leafing through some recent case studies to gather the
literature for his own production, he received a call from his
chauffeur. He had fetched Vidrum’s new car. Vidrum went out to take a
look at it. As he saw it gleaming in the mellow light of the parkway
lamp he thought of his old friends for some reason: “Clever Lootika or
Vrishchika would have said that it looks like a work of the Ṛbhu-s. That
triplet of deities meant a lot to the four sisters, but I had never
heard of them before I came to know them. May be after all there is a
reason why they say the brāḥmaṇa-s are the conduit for communicating
with the gods. No wonder this new car looks good but for some reason I
experience no thrill of the kind I experienced when I got my first
bicycle or for that matter my lamented old car.” He was snapped out of
his musing by his chauffeur who asked him if he would want to go out on
a test drive. Vidrum: “Sure. Let us drive till the foothills of the
temple of Durgā past the pond of lotuses and then go over to the hotel
Kūrmahrada and buy some dinner to take home.”

Back home from the test drive, Vidrum rang in his butler and informed
him that he had obtained dinner from outside and offered the butler and
his wife a packet of the same too. He then asked the butler to prepare
cold turmeric and almond milk for the night and dismissed him. As he was
enjoying his mouth-tingling dinner he lapsed into a train of thought: “I
wish Somakhya was around to cast a spell of protection on my car. Time
and again my mind goes back to my lamented first car. I remember that
day clearly.” As his mind drifted there, his joy from the tasty dinner
flattened quite a bit. Having concluded his meal, he went over to the
little shrine Somakhya had installed for him to worship the 16-handed
Vīryakālī, whose original was enshrined at the edge of the cemetery in
his ancestral village. When Somakhya and Indrasena had learned of that
shrine they were excited. They told him of the great significance of
that goddess as per some ancient text whose name he had forgotten. He
had promised to take them along with Lootika and Vrishchika to his
village someday. He felt his meditation gave him some focus to put a few
words to paper reporting a fatal case involving the infection of a
sanitation worker by *Burkholderia mallei*. As he was doing so, he
remembered that Somakhya had given him a monologue on the bacterium when
they were in college but Vidrum was not yet a suitable vessel to have
imbibed any of it. He kicked himself for the same because he knew it was
something important for his current investigation but he just did not
recall anything. But Somakhya and his gang were far away and in limited
contact; hence, he had to contend with whatever he had.

His mind went back to his old car and the events around it careened
across his mental screen: “I still remember those days. I had a fun ride
and drove by the shuttle-stop at the college to park the car and collect
some stuff from my cubicle. On my way out I saw Vrishchika and her
mother waiting for the shuttle. I offered to give them a ride home. They
accepted it with much gratitude but, as was typical of them, the two
remained silent through much of the ride. Unfazed by the bustle of the
city passing by us, Vrishchika’s mom was grading exam papers. That
brought back memories of her class. Being busy with her daughters, she
only taught part time, but was perhaps the only one of all our female
and most male instructors who had the command and the ability to make
everyone understand — some of that she had passed on to her daughters.
But her exams were always hard. Nevertheless, she was kind unlike many
of our sadistic lecturers, and passed everyone in the final exam. As we
neared their home, Vrishchika’s mom looked up and said: \`I guess you
don’t have anything at hand for dinner — let me pack you some.’ I
graciously acquiesced. When we got to their home, I was seated in the
hall as Vrishchika and her mom went into the kitchen. Vrishchika came
out with a small spoon and asked me to try a pickle and see if I liked
it. It was great. Her mother then responded from the kitchen that she
would aliquot a bottle of the pickle for me. As she was doing so,
Vrishchika asked me if I was finding my new apartment boring without the
\`friends’ from the cemetery. I had to confess that I missed a bit of
all that drama though I certainly found the quiet rather beneficial.
Vrishchika darted into her room and brought out a curious object. It was
a musical bone-pipe made from a human femur. Vrishchika waved it in the
air it made some haunting music, like the wooden pipe made by the
tribesmen from the northern Marahaṭṭa country or southern Mālava. She
said I could blow into it and I might get a visit from interesting
phantoms if they happened to be pleased with the music. I was
apprehensive of any such gift but she told me it will do me good in
life. I wished Vrishchika good luck because she was leaving abroad and I
was not sure if I would ever see her again.

With my dinner in hand, I drove back home with the bone-pipe. That
weekend I blew out of it the tune of a film song. To my surprise I felt
a presence as I used to feel in my old house. There was no one in my
room but I could still feel someone seated next to me. Just as we would
do when plying the planchette, I asked if somebody was around. I
mysteriously fell asleep at that instant and saw a vision of my new car
being destroyed and me dying in the crash. I woke in fear and wished I
could talk to Vrishchika, Somakhya or Lootika about it but they were all
gone. I remembered a strange statement from Lootika when my first bike
was stolen, which she did not elaborate on: \`Wheel after wheel would be
destroyed but your wheel would keep turning.’ The day that prophesy came
true is still fresh in my mind. By some terrible coincidence my car fell
into a ditch the very place Meghana had died. I was indeed lucky not
just to evade the appointment with Citragupta but to escape unscathed
from such a tremendous crash. I thought to myself — may be, l still have
great acts to do in life.”

Vidrum shaken out of his reverie by his butler’s knock on the door to
give him his beverage. He felt a sudden urge to play the bone-pipe. He
lit a bundle of sage and as it was smoldering he took out the pipe from
a box where he carefully stored it and blew out a tune of a folk song to
the 1000-eyed goddess that his grandmother had taught him as a youth.
For a while nothing happened and Vidrum relaxed into the wafting odor of
the sage along with his beverage. With his mind crowded by various
events of the past, he almost forgot that he had plied the pipe when he
jolted by the presence of a strong fellow with some East Asian ancestry,
albeit felt only vaguely. The intensity of the presence soon increased
as it grabbed him by his legs and thrust into his chair. There he felt
another presence seize his very personage and launch him into a bout of
frenzied writing spanning a few pages.

![bhagya2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bhagya2.jpg)

Somakhya and Lootika were sipping their tea as the sun’s declining rays
streamed into their room. Somakhya passed his tablet to Lootika with the
scan of a manuscript on it: “varārohe, what do you make of this?” L:“Why
dear, though eminently legible, this is a very strange handwriting with
a form reminding one of sparklers on a Dīpāvalī night. What is this
strange manuscript?” S: “That metaphor for the writing is indeed very
apt. It was something Vidrum sent me. He apparently took it down some
time ago in a frenzied ghost-dictation induced by the bone-pipe your
first sister had found in our youth. He prefaces it with the comment
that it would be of greatest interest to us. Why don’t you read it out
aloud?” L: “Ah, the musical bone-pipe. I had nearly forgotten about that
one. Should I call the kids; may be they would like the story?” S: “I’ve
not read it yet. So, let us examine it first to make sure it might be of
interest or even appropriate for them. So, let them continue practicing
the workout of the conics that my father has sent them.”

Lootika read it out: “I’m glad I’ve found someone to tell my story as
also a bit of that of my friend. It was my friend who thrust you into
your chair so that I could tell my story. I was a brāhmaṇa, Bāẓ Nayan by
name. My ancestors had come all the way from Jammu and settled in the
hamlet of Indargaon. We followed the Mādhyaṃdina school of the
Śukla-yajurveda. Seeing my precocious capacity in absorbing the Veda
after my upanayana, I was sent far from home to the gurukula at
Rishikesh. There, I acquired the śruti to completion and also become a
scholar of vyākaraṇa mastering the ins and outs of sage Pāṇini and his
commentator Patañjali. But tragedy struck at that point as my family was
wiped out in an earthquake. Left with no one, I went and sought refuge
at the feet of svāmin Ātmānanda giri, a great advaita yati. He employed
me as a teacher for his brahmacāri-s. Later he acquiesced to my
intention to acquire an English education and study linguistics. I did
so in Shimla for 5 years and translated the pariśiṣṭa-s of Kātyāyana
into English. During my stay there, I befriended a Gorkha, Jang Bahādur,
who had to retire from the army after sustaining injuries in a battle
with the Cīna-s. Unfortunately, svāmin Ātmānanda giri’s āśrama was
washed away in a great flood and I was again left with no one in the
world other than my friend Jang Bahādur.

One day he showed me an advertisement in a paper for a Sanskrit
professor in a great peninsular city and suggested that we go there. He
said he might find a security job there. I thought it was a great idea
and after a long journey by train with barely any money we made it to
the city. Thankfully, they spoke and understood some Hindi there and we
could make our way to a rat-and bug-ridden lodge to stay while we found
a job. The job was at the College of Antiquities which was one of
premier research centers in the country. The clerks there asked me for a
domicile certificate and a nationality certificate. As I had neither,
they rudely shooed me away. I had to make a living initially as a cook
and then as an arcaka at a temple of the terrifying Vināyaka. Jang
Bahādur found a job as the nightwatchman for a street.

I still believed I was Sanskrit professor material — I was confident
that few people knew the intricacies of the vyākaraṇa, as it applied to
the śruti, the sāmānya language or the vulgar Prākṛta-s, as I did.
Hence, I went back to the college in the hope of meeting some
Sanskritists who would see my true worth. I found my way into the campus
by somehow convincing the guard to let me in by claiming I was paṇḍita
who had been called for a meeting. I searched around to reach to office
of a brāhmaṇa from the peninsula, Somaśiva Śarman. He was a learned
scholar of both the pure āryavāk as well as its vulgar vikṛti-s, who was
engaged in the project of a great compendium of pre-modern knowledge. He
looked at me quizzically, wondering if a brāhmaṇa could ever have a name
as mine. He asked my gotra and śākhā and then asked me recite sections
from the Vājasaneyi śruti. I noticed he was beginning to believe me as I
did so. I took the opportunity and pulled out my precious typeset
manuscript of the edition and the translation of the Kātiya pariśiṣṭa-s
from my bag and handed it over to him. He studied it intensely for a
while and looking up remarked that he needed to hire me right away. He
moved the bureaucracy with much effort to get me the post of a
staff-paṇḍit at the college.

What followed was an exciting phase of my life. I soon got a small,
on-campus residence — a quaint little tiled roof house. I also managed
to secure my friend Jang Bahādur a job as a security man for the campus
museums. He had supplied me a manuscript from Nepal on Kiranti temples.
I studied and translated it and published an article in a white
indological journal. I followed it up with another paper in such a
journal reflecting the linguistic knowledge that I had acquired from
Somaśiva Śarman on the substrates in Indo-Aryan. The I went with
Jayasvāmin, the curator of our museum, and his wife Śilpikā to study a
Gupta temple of Bhairava and the 8 mothers in Mālava. In that
expedition, we found a cache of Gupta gold coins that we brought back to
the college museum to study. Jayasvāmin and Somaśiva with their
epigraphic expertise worked out some worn inscriptions in the temple and
based on that we wrote a paper that described the early phases of the
Bhairava-srotas and how the worship of Kārttikeya followed by the 8
mothers was an important facet of that tradition. As part of that study,
I reconstructed a verse to Skanda in the Vasantatilaka meter that was
inscribed in that temple during the reign of emperor Vikramāditya, which
described a fierce form of Skanda. This tradition was to be incorporated
as Baṭukanātha in the later Bhairava tradition. All this work earned me
some reputation in the college and mleccha visitors from aboard came to
pick my knowledge. It was then that my patrons at the college suggested
that I submit a dissertation for the doctoral degree at the university.
Thus, I could upgrade myself from a mere staff paṇḍit to a professor. As
I was wondering what I should submit as a dissertation, Śilpikā had
invited a young brāhmaṇa lady to talk about a paper she had recently
published on a comparative analysis of the substrates in the different
Yajurveda saṃhitā-s and the implications it had for the āryan conquest
of the northern India.”

Lootika paused and interjected: “O Bhārgava, this is most interesting.
The phantom’s tale is directly intersecting with our lives. Śilpikā is
none other than our learned language teacher, whom we gave much grief as
children, and the young lady he mentions is undoubtedly your own mother
— perhaps from the days just before your birth.” S: “It has to be so. I
really hope Śilpikā did not cast a spell on us that our children regress
to the mean. Yet, this phantom seems unfamiliar to me. Pray continue
dear.”

L: “That lady’s paper suggested a topic for my dissertation, which was
always as at the bottom of my mind. It was a detailed comparative study
of all Yajurveda texts. I worked hard and wrote an over 1000-page
monograph of the subject. It featured many new translations, detailed
analysis of the śrauta practices and the like. Jayasvāmin and Somaśiva
presided as my preceptors and I was awarded the coveted title of
Professor. I was at the height of my powers and wanted to publish my
dissertation as a two-volume work. But the gods apparently had other
plans. Two disasters struck our college and me personally. That summer,
during the vacations, a band of uśnīśin terrorists broke into our
museum. Jang Bahādur bravely defended the premises but was killed in the
process and the terrorists made away with the Gupta gold coins and
melted them down to finance their operations. A few months later,
left-liberal activists, claiming to be righting the wrongs done to the
depressed classes, demolished a wall of our college and fired our
archives. As a result, my typeset dissertation was burnt down and lost.

Sometime before that, Cidānanda yati, a survivor of the advaitāśrama
that was washed away, had come to city and was conducting classes on
Śaṅkarācārya’s tradition. He called me to meet him and help him with the
translations of the texts of Appayya Dikṣita and Girvāṇendra Dikṣita
that he was preparing. In course of those discussions, he introduced me
to a song composed by one of the Śaṅkaramaṭha-s and told me that no
amount of yaci bham and phak were going to take me anywhere if I did not
awaken from the dream of phenomenal existence into satchidānanda. The
former would only take me on the path of rayi to the realm of the Moon,
where the forefathers dwell. Then I would return to be born again, he
said. Instead, if I followed the path of austerity, celibacy, faith and
Brahmavidyā, I would have the great awakening into the sole reality that
is Brahman. Soon thereafter a great comet appeared in the sky. A little
later, the Japanese man who was the first man to observe that comet
died.

Those events got me thinking about the arrival of the Pitṛrāṭ. I was sad
on one hand about the loss of my dissertation on the other the
possibility of never transcending the realms to know that there is only
satchidānanda. I rationalized that there was no reason to fear death at
all — after all it is something no one experiences. When one is alive
there is no obviously no experience of death. When one is dead there is
no experience of death; so, why fear something one never experiences.
However, for many death can come with suffering. There was no way to
prevent that even if one did not fear death for the suffering before
death was after all a real experience. But then if one experienced that
which is satchidānanda then one would realize that the suffering was
just like in a dream. But if one does not experience satchidānanda then
what are the experiences after death, if they exist at all, I wondered.

I was to get the answer for all this soon. Sundara Somayājin was a Soma
ritualist from the Drāviḍa country. He was performing a Somayāga in the
city. I had long wanted to witness that kind of a Yāga and went to meet
him. We had a philosophical discussion on the Vedic religion. He said
that what was important was the correct svara of recitation and precise
execution of ritual actions as per the ritual treatises. It really did
not matter if the gods like Indra or the Aśvin-s existed. They were
anyhow not gods to be worshiped in the same sense as the ‘real̍ gods’
like Śiva or Gaṇeśa or Viṣṇu, he said. I became very afraid when I heard
this. I reminded him that such words were uttered by the ignorant to the
great ṛṣi Nemo Bhārgava:

nendro astīti nema u tva āha ka īṃ dadarśa kam abhi ṣṭavāma \|\|  
“Indra does not exist, o Nema” So indeed he says.  
“Who ever has seen him?” “Whom shall we praise forth?”

Thus the ignorant questioned the existence of the great god. But he made
his presence felt:  
ayam asmi jaritaḥ paśya meha viśvā jātāny abhy asmi mahnā \|  
ṛtasya mā pradiśo vardhayanty ādardiro bhuvanā dardarīmi \|\|

Here I am, o chanter: see me here.  
I’m at fore in all the species by my greatness.  
The directives of the natural laws magnify me.  
As the smasher, I keep smashing the worlds.

The Somayājin dismissed me by saying that it was all arthavāda and after
all no Indra appeared at some given time to some Nema because the Veda
was coeval with the beginning of time. In one of the talks in the
college, I had heard another śrauta ritualist talk about the Seat of
Vivasvān. He had mentioned that its knowledge was very important to
evade the arrow of Ugra Deva when one is performing a yāga.
Unfortunately, our Somayājin did not seem very aware of it and was to
learn the reality of Indra very soon. Perhaps, due to some pāpa I had
committed in a past janman, I too was to bound in karman with him. After
the Ṣoḍaśin-graha was taken, the sky blackened with a mass of clouds and
a great streak of lightning followed by a thunderous peal struck the
pandal that had been erected for the yāga. An electrical explosion and
fire followed and the learned Sundara Somayājin was borne to the abode
of Vivasvān’s son, like Meghanāda struck by the Indrāstra discharged by
the Saumitri or like Arṇa and Citraratha being felled by Maghavan beyond
the Sindhu or like the Sāmavedin-s of Vaṅga or Aṅga being washed away by
a blow from his vajra. I too was consumed by the fierce Kravyāda on that
day.

A month or so after my expiration, a band of socialists paid by a
mleccha instigator, claiming to be acting on behalf of the depressed
classes, attacked my college campus again. My house and belongings were
among the things consumed in their arson. In my heydays, among my many
foreign visitors was a Gaulish woman, Laetitia Vernon by name, who
sought my help to read Sanskrit legal texts. Despite my many stern
warnings, my only son got infatuated with her and having married her
left for the shores of a mleccha land. My son having adopted the
mlecchānusāra did not perform any kriyā-s for me. He instead wrote an
article in my memory saying that the secular India was coming of age
with progress and equity even as the brahminical superstition was
becoming a thing of the past. Consequently, upon my death I wander as a
brahmarakṣas. At least me and my friend Jang Bahādur are united in death
and we lead a mostly quiet incorporeal existence haunting the little
hill that lies between my college and the river.”

Lootika told her mother-in-law about the story and asked if she had any
recollection of this deceased man. Somakhya’s mother: “I never took the
claims of the phantasmagorical encounters of you kids seriously. But I
must say this one comes about as close to being believable as any. Yes,
Bāẓ Nayan was a learned man who was borne away by the inexorable force
of fate — after all, even the Yādava-s, be it the mighty Sātyaki or the
brave Pradyuṁna, had to clobber themselves out of existence when their
time came.” She went to the study and brought out a huge volume and gave
it to Lootika: “However, here is a copy of his dissertation. While
nobody knows this, it was not lost for good after all. I had made a copy
of it for my own study. I wanted to give it you all for it still
contains insights that will help you in your own study and practice of
the śruti, but I kept forgetting. While no photo or belonging of Bāẓ
Nayan Śarman seems to have survived the one who chomps through the
Vanaspati-s, after all, my dear, the śruti has said: ‘na tasya pratimā
asti yasya nāma mahad yaśaḥ\|‘”

The Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa (1.1.29 of the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa) of the
Atharvaveda provides a glimpse of the Vedic saṃhitā canon as known to
the brāhmaṇa authors of the AV tradition. The Brahmayajña might be done
as part of the basic rite as done by dvija-s of other śākhā-s or as part
of the more elaborate AV tradition of the annual Veda-vrata. The annual
vrata-s of the Atharvaṇ brāhmaṇa-s include the Sāvitrī-vrata,
Veda-vrata, Kalpa-vrata, Mitra-vrata, Yama-vrata and Mṛgāra-vrata. The
kṣatriya-s and vaiśya-s should do at least 3 and 2 of them respectively,
with the first 2 being obligatory. During these vrata-s the ritualist
follows certain strictures like not consuming butter milk nor eating
kidney beans, common millets, or the masura lentils at the evening meal,
bathing thrice a day and wearing woolen clothing. Before performing
Brahmayajña, he performs the ācamana as per the vidhi which states:  
sa ācamanaṃ karoti \|  
He performs the ritual sipping of water.

This calls for the special Atharvaṇic ācamana described in the final
section of the ācamana-brāhmaṇa of the AV tradition (GB 1.1.39):  
tad apy etad ṛcoktam —  
It has also been thus stated in the ṛk:

“āpo bhṛgvaṅgiro rūpam āpo bhṛgvaṅgiromayaṃ \|  
sarvam āpomayaṃ bhūtaṃ sarvaṃ bhṛgvaṅgiromayam \|\|”  
The waters are of the form Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. The waters are
imbued with the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.  
All being is imbued with the waters; \[thus,\] all \[being\] is imbued
by the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.

•The Atharvaṇ-s justify the above ṛk is by noting that the Paippalāda
Atharvaveda begins with the ṛk “śaṃ no devīḥ…” to the waters (see
below).

antaraite trayo vedā bhṛgūn aṅgiraso ‘nugāḥ \|\|  
Within these \[waters\] the three \[other\] Veda-s follow the
Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.

“apāṃ puṣpaṃ mūrtir ākāśaṃ pavitram uttamam” iti ācamyābhyukṣy ātmānam
anumantrayata \| \[sūrya jīva devā jīvā jīvyāsam aham \|  
sarvam āyur jīvyāsam \|\|\]  
“The flower is the form of the waters, the empty space \[and\] that
which the most pure”. Thus, he sips the water and having sprinkled water
(practically mārjanam) he recites the incantation indra jīva etc:
Enliven, o Indra; Enliven o Sūrya. Enliven, o gods. May I live. May I
complete my term of life.

•The flower of the waters in the above incantation is an allusion to the
ṛk describing the the ancient action of the Atharvaṇ-s in kindling the
fire in waters \[from a lotus\]: \`\`tvām agne puṣkarād adhy atharvā nir
amanthata \|”  
•He does the ācamana by taking three sips each with two successive words
from the mantra apām puṣpam…

iti brāhmaṇam \|\|  
Thus is the brāhmaṇa.

Now for the Brahmayajña:  
kiṃ devatam iti ? ṛcām agnir devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| gāyatraṃ
chandaḥ \| pṛthivī sthānam \|  
“agnim īḷe purohitaṃ yajñasya devam ṛtvijaṃ \| hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam
\|\|”  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā ṛgvedam adhīyate \|\|  
Who is the deity? Agni is the deity of the ṛk-s. That is indeed light.
Gāyatrī is its meter. The earth is its station.  
“I praise Agni, the officiant of the ritual, the god and ritualist; the
hotṛ and the foremost giver of gems.”  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Ṛgveda is studied.

yajuṣāṃ vāyur devatam \| tad eva jyotis traiṣṭubhaṃ chandaḥ \|
antarikṣaṃ sthānam \|  
iṣe tvorje tvā vāyava stha devo vaḥ savitā prārpayatu śreṣṭhatamāya
karmaṇe \|\|  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā yajurvedam adhīyate \|\|  
Vāyu is the deity of the Yajuṣ-es. That is verily light; Triṣṭubh is its
meter. The atmosphere is its station.  
“To you for nourishment, to you for strength. You are the Vāyu-s. May
Savitṛ impel you the most excellent ritual.”  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Yajurveda is studied.

sāmnām ādityo devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| jāgataṃ chandaḥ \| dyauḥ
sthānam \|  
“agna ā yāhi vītaye gṛṇāno havyadātaye \| ni hotā satsi barhiṣi \|\|”  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā samāvedam adhīyate \|\|  
The Āditya is the deity of the Sāman-s. That is indeed light. Jagati is
its meter. The heaven is its station.  
O Agni, come to the oblations, praised with songs to the ritual
offering. Sit as the hotṛ on the ritual grass.  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Sāmaveda is studied.

atharvaṇāṃ candramā devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| sarvāṇi chandāṃsi \|
āpaḥ sthānam \| \<śaṃ no devīr abhiṣṭaya> ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvātharvavedam
adhīyate \|\|  
The moon is the deity of the Atharvaṇ incantations. That is indeed
light. All are its meters. The waters are its station. “May the divine
\[waters\] be auspicious for us…” Thus, having placed it at the
beginning the Atharvaveda is studied.

adbhyaḥ sthāvara-jaṅgamo bhūta-grāmaḥ saṃbhavati \| tasmāt sarvam
āpomayaṃ bhūtaṃ sarvaṃ bhṛgvaṅgiromayam \| antaraite trayo vedā bhṛgūn
aṅgirasaḥ śritā ity ab iti prakṛtir apām oṃkāreṇa ca \| etasmād vyāsaḥ
purovāca:  
“bhṛgvaṅgirovidā saṃskṛto ‘nyān vedān adhīyīta \|  
nānyatra saṃskṛto bhṛgvaṅgiraso ‘dhīyīta \|\|”  
From the waters the families of immotile and motile organisms have come
into being. Hence, all being is imbued with water; \[thus\] all is
imbued with the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. The three other Veda-s are
situated within these Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. Therefore, indeed it
is water and the origin of water is by the Oṃkāra. In this regard Vyāsa
had formerly said:  
“He who is sanctified by the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations may study the
other Veda-s.  
The one sanctified elsewhere should not study the Veda of the
Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras-es.”

•Regarding the origin of all beings from water: this is articulated
early on in the ṛk: yo apsv ā śucinā daivyena… (RV 2.35.8) of Gṛtsamada
Śaunahotra.

sāmavede ‘tha khilaśrutir brahmacaryeṇa caitasmād atharvāṅgiraso ha yo
veda sa veda sarvam \|  
iti brāhmaṇam \|\|  
Now there is also the khila of the Sāmaveda: “Therefore, he who as a
celibate student knows the Veda of Atharvāṅgiras-es knows all this.”

Thus is the brāhmaṇa.

•The statement from the Sāmaveda-khila is also taken to justify the
punarupanayana that is performed in order for those of other traditions
to study the Atharvaveda.

Notes  
Several notable points are raised by the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa of the AV,
not just regarding the AV tradition but also regarding its interaction
with the other Vedic schools and their own evolution. It is quite
obvious that the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa represents a relatively late
brāhmaṇa composition with a specific aim of justifying the primacy of
the AV, probably in the context of the intra-brahminical competition for
the position of the brahman in the śrauta ritual. This is explicitly
supported by the fact that it cites Vyāsa \[Pārāśarya\] who appears in
late Vedic texts and is remembered by tradition as the redactor of the 4
fold form of the śruti. In a similar vein, the citation of the
Sāmaveda-khila suggests that it was composed after the terminal sections
of the Sāmavedic tradition had been completed.

The opening ṛk of the RV is compatible with any of the śakha-s of the
Ṛgveda. The Yajurveda that it refers to is clearly the Vājasaneyi
saṃhitā (either Mādhyaṃdina or the Kāṇva śākhā-s). The Samaveda could
again be any of the Samavedic saṃhitā-s. The Atharvaveda is probably the
Paippalāda saṃhitā because the vulgate and the Śaunakīya begin with “ye
triśaptāḥ…” However, we must note that we do not know the beginning of
the lost AV śākhā-s.

Why is this notable? The AV-pariśiṣṭa 46 (Uttama-paṭala) gives the
beginning and end verses of the four Veda saṃhitā-s along with several
AV verses to be used in the annual Veda-vrata. Notably, these are partly
different from those of the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa. Interestingly,
according to the Uttama-paṭala, the RV ends with the famous ṛk: “tac
chamyor āvṛṇimahe…”. This is not present in the Śākala-pāṭha which
instead ends with the short Saṃjñā-sūkta. The former ṛk was claimed by
Michael Witzel to be the last ṛk of the Bāṣkala RV. However, as Vishal
Agrawal correctly noted its is stated to be the last ṛk by even the
Śāñkhāyana and Kauśītaki traditions. Thus, the Uttama-paṭala is
referring to some RV śākhā other than Śākala, though we cannot be sure
of its identity.

The Uttama-paṭala gives the Sāmaveda’s first verse as “agna ā yāhi…”,
which is known to be the first ṛk of all surviving śākhā-s of the SV.
However, the last ṛk is given as:  
“eṣa sya te dhārayā suto ‘vyo vārebhir havane maditavyam \| krīḍan
raśmir apārthivaḥ \|\|”  
This is different from the ṛk “svasti na indro vṛddhaśravāḥ…” with which
the surviving SV śākhā-s conclude. It is a divergent variant of the ṛk
RV 9.108.5 not attested elsewhere. In fact the extant SV saṃhitā-s
contain a version that follows the RV cognate. Thus, evidently the
Uttama-paṭala is referring to a now lost SV śākhā.

The situation with the YV is the most interesting. The cited starting
mantra goes thus:  
“iṣe tvorje tvā vāyava sthopāyava stha devo vaḥ savitā prārpayatu
śreṣṭhatamāya karmaṇa āpyāyadhvam aghnyā indrāya bhāgam ūrjasvatīḥ
payasvatīḥ prajāvatīr anamīvā ayakṣmā mā va stena īśata māghaśaṃso
rudrasya hetiḥ pari vo vṛṇaktu dhruvā asmin gopatau syāta bahvīr
yajamānasya paśūn pāhi \|\|”

Remarkably, this mantra is not found in any of the extant YV saṃhitā-s.
However, the “indrāya bhāgam” is reminiscent of the “indrāya
deva-bhāgam” found in the Āpastamba-śrautasūtra and the
Bhāradvāja-śrautasūtra or the “devebhya indrāya” found in the
Maitrāyaṇīya saṃhitā. Moreover, the last mantra of the Yajurveda is
given as “dadhikrāvṇo akāriṣam…”. In other YV saṃhitā-s, this mantra
occurs in the Aśvamedha section and is used among other thing by the
ritualists to purify their mouths after the obscene sexual dialog.
However, it is not the last mantra of the Aśvamedha section in any of
the extant saṃhitā-s. This indicates two things: first, the
Uttama-paṭala is recording a now lost YV śākha of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda
(KYV). Second, while today Āpastamba and Bhāradvāja are attached to the
Taittirīya-śākhā, they were once the sūtra-s of a lost KYV śākhā. This
loss likely happened relatively early. It was probably associated with
the southward movement of the Āpastamba-s and Bhāradvāja-s, who then
shifted to the related Taittirīya-saṃhitā (TS). The text of the
Baudhāyana-śrautasūtra precisely follows the TS; hence, it was
definitely one of the original sūtra-s of the Taittirīya-śākhā.

Finally, the AV of the Uttama-paṭala begins with “ye triśaptāḥ…”
indicating that it was recording the original śākhā behind the vulgate
or the Śaunakīya.

Thus, we see a striking difference between the two AV traditions of the
Gopatha-brāhmaṇa and the Uttama-paṭala. While the tendency is to see the
AV-pariśiṣṭa-s as late and post-dating the brāhmaṇa, we have to be more
cautious. First, the AV-pariśiṣṭa-s are a rather composite mass
recording a range of traditions that with a wide temporal span. Some
material like the Nakṣatra-kalpa-sūkta could closer to the late brāḥmaṇa
material in age whereas, at the other end, the tortoise-soothsaying
(Kurmavibhāga) is likely a late text. We posit that the Uttama-paṭala
belongs to the an early layer of the AV-pariśiṣṭa-s — this provides a
reasonable hypothesis for the divergence between it and the brāhmaṇa.
First, it should be noted that the AV-Paippalāda-AV-Śaunakīya/vulgate
divergence is rather deep — mirroring the deep divergence of the Kṛṣṇa
and Śukla branches of the Yajurveda. This split might have gone along
with some geographical separation in the initial phase of their
divergence. This geographical separation model would suggest that the
Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa tradition was associated with the AV-Paippalāda or
a related lost AV school that was in the vicinity of the old
Vājasaneyin-s. This is also supported by certain parallels seen between
the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa and the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa in the śrauta sections.
In contrast, the Uttama-paṭala as associated with the Śaunakīya or a
related school that developed in the vicinity of a lost KYV śākhā.

We have evidence that the interactions between the KYV and AV traditions
might go back even deeper in time: for example, this is clearly
supported by the AV-related Bhavā-Śarvā-sūkta of the Kaṭha-s that was
likely present in the lost Kaṭha-brahmaṇa and the various shared sūkta-s
and upaniṣat material between the Taittirīya and the AV. Finally, we
have evidence from what is today Gujarat that at a later period there
was a certain equilibriation of the AV schools with the combination of
the Paippalāda and Śaunakīya material. This parallels a similar
acquisition of some Kaṭha material by the Taittirīya. Thus, there
appears to have been a relatively complex web of fission and fusion
interactions between the śākha-s over a protracted period.

Anyone familiar with dynamical systems knows of the Henon-Heiles (HH)
system. What we are presenting here is well-known stuff about which
reams of material have been written. However, we offer certain tricks
for visualizing this system that make it easy for lay readers with just
a high school knowledge of mathematics to play with. The HH system was
discovered by the French astronomer Henon and his colleague Heiles when
they were studying the motion of stars in the galaxy under the influence
of the gravity of the total matter in the galaxy. The true astronomical
significance of these equations outside the scope of the current
discussion. Our own original interest in this problem was primarily from
the perspective experimental mathematics (“play physics”), starting as
an extension to our interest in defining ovals by means of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). The system defined by Henon and Heiles
considers the motion of a body in 2 dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. a
fixed plane. The phase space describing the motion is thus defined by
the variables ![(x, y, p_x,
p_y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%2C+p_x%2C+p_y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
describe the position in two dimensions and ![p_x,
p_y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x%2C+p_y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
describes the momentum in the two directions. Given that the momenta are
![p_x= mx';
p_y=my'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x%3D+mx%27%3B+p_y%3Dmy%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
for a body of unit mass the momenta become the derivative of the
position variables with respect to time ![(x'=\\tfrac{dx}{dt},
y'=\\tfrac{dy}{dt})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D%2C+y%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdt%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Henon and Heiles considered a potential described by the equation:

![V(x,y) = \\dfrac{x^2+y^2}{2}+x^2y-\\dfrac{y^3}{3} \\kern 3em \\cdots
\\S

The potential energy of a simple harmonic oscillator in the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
direction is
![V(x)=\\tfrac{kx^2}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%28x%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bkx%5E2%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By taking a unit force constant
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we see that the terms

represent two orthogonal simple harmonic oscillators. The further
nonlinear term,
![x^2y-\\tfrac{y^3}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2y-%5Ctfrac%7By%5E3%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

is a perturbation that couples these oscillators. This potential takes
the form of a cubic hyperboloid-paraboloid and is visualized in Figure
1.

The kinetic energy of the body is given by

where
![v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the velocity of the body. Thus, for the above-defined HH system we
get
![T=\\tfrac{x'^2+y'^2}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%27%5E2%2By%27%5E2%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The Hamiltonian of a system, which represents its total energy, is given
by
![H=T+V](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3DT%2BV&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since this is an energy conserving system, its total energy is equal to
a scalar constant
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the energy level of the system. Thus, for the HH system we get:

![H=\\dfrac{x'^2+y'^2+x^2+y^2}{2}+x^2y-\\dfrac{y^3}{3}= E \\kern 3em

![V(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by planes corresponding to different energy levels
![z=E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3DE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the equipotential curves within which the
![x,y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would lie for a given energy level (Figure 2). We observe that if
![E=\\tfrac{1}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the equipotential curve becomes 3 intersecting lines that form an
equilateral triangle defined by the equilibrium points
![(-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\tfrac{1}{2}); (0,1);
(\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},
-\\tfrac{1}{2}))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B2%7D%2C+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%29%3B+%280%2C1%29%3B+%28%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B2%7D%2C+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Within this equilateral triangle, the body exhibits bounded motion.
Thus, for all
![E\<\\tfrac{1}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3C%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get bounded trajectories in the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane. As
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes smaller the central equipotential boundary tends towards a
circle and degenerates to a point at 0. However, for
![E>\\tfrac{1}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3E%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get curves that are open; hence, at these energy levels the body can
escape to infinity via the open lanes. Thus, there is a clearly defined
escape energy level for this system,
![E=\\tfrac{1}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Figure 2. The energy levels correspond to ![E=\\tfrac{1}{32},

To study the trajectories under this system we first obtain the
equations for the force acting on a body of unit mass (acceleration) in
each direction from the above potential by taking the negative partial
derivative with respect to each positional variable:

![x''= -\\dfrac{\\partial V(x,y)}{\\partial x} =
-x-2xy](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27%27%3D+-%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpartial+V%28x%2Cy%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%3D+-x-2xy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![y''= -\\dfrac{\\partial V(x,y)}{\\partial y} = -y
-x^2+y^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%27%3D+-%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpartial+V%28x%2Cy%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%3D+-y+-x%5E2%2By%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From the above can now get a system of ODEs thus:

![x'=p_x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27%3Dp_x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y'=p_y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3Dp_y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![p_x'=x''=
-x-2xy](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x%27%3Dx%27%27%3D+-x-2xy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![p_y'=y''=-y -x^2+y^2 \\kern 3em \\cdots \\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_y%27%3Dy%27%27%3D-y+-x%5E2%2By%5E2+%5Ckern+3em+%5Ccdots+%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The solutions to this system ![\\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yield a curve in the 4-dimensional phase-space ![(x,y, p_x,
p_y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%2C+p_x%2C+p_y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
To solve ![\\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we first need to obtain some initial conditions for a given energy level
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using the Hamiltonian ![\\S
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We do that by setting
![x_0=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then choose some values of ![y_0,
p\_{y0}=y_0'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_0%2C+p_%7By0%7D%3Dy_0%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From those we can calculate
![p\_{x0}=x_0'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bx0%7D%3Dx_0%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
thus:

![p\_{x0}=
\\sqrt{2E-p_y^2-y^2+\\dfrac{2y^3}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bx0%7D%3D+%5Csqrt%7B2E-p_y%5E2-y%5E2%2B%5Cdfrac%7B2y%5E3%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One can see that this places a constraint on the allowed ![y_0,
p\_{y0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_0%2C+p_%7By0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
— they have to be chosen such that
![p\_{x0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bx0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is real. Once we have these initial conditions we can solve the above
ODEs with efficient LSODA solver written by Alan Hindmarsh and Linda
Petzold or you can write your own solver by the method of Runge and
Kutta as we did in our youth. Initial results below are shown using the
LSODA solver. However, we will see below that we can also obtain
solutions without using traditional ODE solutions. Figure 4 shows an
example of solution for the energy level
![E=\\tfrac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and initial conditions ![x_0=0; y_0= 0.1, y_0'=
0.14](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0%3B+y_0%3D+0.1%2C+y_0%27%3D+0.14&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the 3D space defined by ![x, y,
y'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/henhei_fig3-1.png)

Figure 3.

To get a better understanding of its behavior, we can visualize the
solution in several other ways Figure 4. First, we can simply look at
the way ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
change with time (first 2 top left panels of Figure 4). As expected,
![x(t),
y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%2C+y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would be oscillatory functions that cannot be defined using any
elementary functions. We can also examine the positional trajectory of
the body in its plane of motion by plotting ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(top right panel of Figure 4). From the equipotential curves defined
above from ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we can see that this trajectory would be bounded by the closed loop of
the curve defined by the equation (shown in blue):

![\\dfrac{x^2+y^2}{2}+x^2y-\\dfrac{y^3}{3}=E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E2%2By%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%2Bx%5E2y-%5Cdfrac%7By%5E3%7D%7B3%7D%3DE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can also plot ![y,
y'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(bottom left panel of Figure 4) which shows how momentum changes with
the position in the
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
direction. This curve will be bounded by a special oval (shown in blue)
that is determined by letting ![x=0;
x'=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0%3B+x%27%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the Hamiltonian ![\\S
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This gives us a cubic curve defined by the equation (in standard
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
coordinates, not the ![(x,
y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the phase space of the solutions of ![\\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)):

![\\dfrac{x^2+y^2}{2}-\\dfrac{x^3}{3}=E \\kern 3em \\cdots \\S

The closed loop of the cubic ![\\S
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the bounding oval, which was what got us first interested in the HH
system in the 16th year of our life.

Figure 4.

Finally, the bottom right panel of Figure 4 shows the Poincare section
that records the points where the curve shown in Figure 3 pierces the
plane
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(See below for further discussions). It is obvious that these are a
subset of the ![y,
y'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plot and will thus be bounded by the same oval ![\\S
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The way to compute the Poincare section is to search the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values of solution for cases where the sign of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are different. Such successive points will bound the segments of the
curve that pierce the plane
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Given that our steps for numerical integration are small, we can
calculate the corresponding values of ![y,
y'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using linear interpolation: ![y=\\tfrac{y_n+y\_{n+1}}{2}; \\;
y'=\\tfrac{y_n+y\_{n+1}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7By_n%2By_%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D%7B2%7D%3B+%5C%3B+y%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7By_n%2By_%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Plotting the thus calculated ![y,
y'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will give us the Poincare sections for a given starting point. Now, we
can also calculate the solutions for above system ![\\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
without solving the ODEs by converting it into a discrete difference
equation. These difference equations have a step parameter
![\\epsilon](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which if kept small can yield solutions equivalent to that obtained by
solving the ODEs. The system of difference equations goes thus:

![p\_{xn+1}= p\_{xn}+\\epsilon
(-x_n-2x_ny_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Bxn%2B1%7D%3D+p_%7Bxn%7D%2B%5Cepsilon+%28-x_n-2x_ny_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![p\_{yn+1}= p\_{yn} + \\epsilon
(-y_n+y_n^2-x_n^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7Byn%2B1%7D%3D+p_%7Byn%7D+%2B+%5Cepsilon+%28-y_n%2By_n%5E2-x_n%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![x\_{n+1}= x_n+\\epsilon
p\_{xn+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+x_n%2B%5Cepsilon+p_%7Bxn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}= y_n+\\epsilon
p\_{yn+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+y_n%2B%5Cepsilon+p_%7Byn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/henhei_fig5-1.png)

Figure 5.

We empirically determined that by setting ![\\epsilon
=0.02](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+%3D0.02&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can get results similar to the solution of the ODEs with time steps
of 0.01. This provides us an easy mechanism, with somewhat higher speed
than the ODE solver, to obtain equivalent solutions for the HH system.
This in turn allows us to explore the Poincare sections for different
initial values at a much higher density. Figure 5 shows one such
exploration of Poincare sections for the energy level
![E=0.128](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D0.128&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with 100 different initial conditions, each plotted in a different
color. The result is a beautiful oval with an inner decoration by a
strange attractor reminiscent of one of the ovoids produced for the
Russian royalty. The attractor shows clear preferred regions for the
intersections of certain orbits and regions where the intersections are
chaotically distributed. To better understand the relationship between
the structure of the Poincare sections and the form of the orbits on the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane we take the case of
![E=\\tfrac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and examine 12 initial points chosen from different regions of the
Poincare sections, i.e. defined ![y_0,
y_0'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_0%2C+y_0%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
with
![x_0=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6).

Figure 6.

The trajectories of these initial points on the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane are plotted in Figure 7. Towards the narrow end of the bounding
oval we have an oval exclusion zone and the towards the broad end of the
oval we have a candra-bindu (crescent and dot) clearing zone. The
initial point 1 lies at the center of the narrow end oval clearing. This
initial point and the center of the crescent clearing at the broad end
(not shown) yield a trajectory with a single loop with 3 apexes (top
row, leftmost plot of Figure 7). The next trajectory (top row, next plot
moving left to right) is a straight line at a
![45^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=45%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
incline and corresponds to the center of the two “eyes” of the Poincare
section (point 2 in figure 6 is one of these eyes).

Figure 7. The trajectories of the points corresponding to Figure 6 in
left to right in 3 rows from top to bottom.

The basis of these trajectories can be understood from the plots of the
functions ![x(t);
y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3B+y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 8; for every point in Figure 6 and trajectory in Figure 7 the
corresponding ![x(t);
y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3B+y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are shown one below the other from top to bottom in 2 columns). The
first two trajectories result from oscillations where both
![x(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
have period 1 — they show the same repeating pattern after one
oscillation. Thus, these two cases can be said to be in a 1:1 resonance.
In the second case, they are additionally in phase, i.e. the crest and
trough at the same time.

Point 3 samples the center one of the four “islands” which surround the
above-mentioned “eyes” of the Poincare section. Each of the
island-centers results in a trajectory like the 3rd plot (Figure 7, top
row). Point 4 samples one of the small crescents in the vicinity of the
oval exclusion zone around point 1 and results in the trajectory seen in
plot 4 of Figure 7. These two trajectories result from ![x(t);
y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3B+y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where both have a periodicity of 4, i.e. a 4:4 resonance. Of the two the
trajectory 3 arises from a case where in addition to 4:4 resonance the
two oscillators are also in phase.

Point 5 (Figure 6) and its corresponding trajectory (Figure 7)
corresponds to two period 5 oscillators in a 5:5 resonance (Figure 8).
Such 5:5 resonance oscillators are a pervasive feature of the HH system
at this energy level and correspond to the 5 islands of exclusion around
the oval exclusion around point 1, the center of the bindu and the two
exclusion zones flanking either tip of the crescent.

Figure 8

Point 6 corresponds to a trajectory arising from a 8:9 resonance; point
7 evolves into a more complex 5:25 resonance; the trajectory of point 8
simulates a 3D ribbon and arises from the even more complex 11:37
resonance.

The trajectories arising from points 9, 10 and 11 exhibit what might be
termed quasiperiodic behavior. In the case of the evolution of point 9,
![x(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a quasiperiod of 4, i.e., it has a similar pattern repetition after
every 4 oscillation but the successive repeats are not identical but
change slightly over time.
![y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
on the contrary, has a strict period of 1. In the evolution of point 10,
![x(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a quasiperiod of 5 which is overlayed on a nearly regular higher
period of 15. These two points are representative of the evolution of
the points in the zones close the bounding oval on its narrow side. One
may note that the evolution of point 11 is like a “broadband” version of
the 5:5 resonance points. Keeping with this,
![x(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a strict period of 5, whereas
![y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a quasiperiod of 5 with higher-order repeat patterns of multiples of
5.

Finally, the evolution of point 12 is chaotic, i.e. the oscillations
have no discernible period. The irregularity is marked in
![y(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but is
![x(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it manifests more slowly over time. These chaotic trajectories form the
bulk of the central uniform distribution of points in the Poincare
section. The appearance of chaos can be seen as the limit of the
trajectories with increasingly complex or longer period resonances. The
quasiperiodic orbits with a nearly regular short period internal repeat
structure might be seen as lying at the edge of long periods and true
periodicity. In terms of energy levels, chaos starts appearing in the
central regions close to
![E=\\tfrac{1}{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and by
![E=\\tfrac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
constitutes the bulk of the internal structure of the Poincare section
with internal islands of periodicity and quasiperiodicity in the
anterior periphery of the oval. By the limiting
![E=\\tfrac{1}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
nearly all of the trajectories become chaotic.

In conclusion, the HH system qualitatively shows all the typical forms
of oscillatory behaviors observed in natural systems (e.g. variable star
light curves, weather patterns, population dynamics and far-from
equilibrium oscillatory chemical reactions): periodicity with different
resonances, quasiperiodicity and chaos. It thus provides a good example
how any system whose phase space is defined by even simple ODEs with
non-linear terms can exhibit the behavioral diversity characteristic of
natural systems.

The notes from it are appended below.

The loss of the northern and northwestern Kṛṣnayajurveda traditions due
to the Mohammedan depredations of Northern India (aided an abetted by
the predatory Anglospheric regimes) has been one the great tragedies
faced by Hindudom. Hence, it is rather important to collate and restore
whatever remains of these traditions, namely those belonging to the
Kaṭha and Kapiṣṭhala schools, which were once dominant in the greater
Panjab and Kashmir. In the 1940s, vidyābhāskara, vedāntaratna
Sūryakānta, saṃskṛtācārya of the Pañjāba-viśvavidyālaya, Lavapura
(modern Lahore) had collated several Kaṭha fragments that came from lost
texts outside of the relatively well-preserved saṃhitā. These came from
the lost brāhmaṇa and the surviving āraṇyaka, as well as the lost
mantrapāṭha of the Kaṭha-s that went with the sūtra-s of Laugākṣi.
Notable in this regard, were the following manuscripts that Sūryakānta
found in what is today the terrorist state: 1) A Śāradā manuscript which
was written in 1033 Vikrama-saṃvat, bright āṣāḍha aṣṭami (approximately
June of 1111 CE) in Gilgit. Ironically, this manuscript was found in the
possession of a mulla named Hafiz ar Rahman of the Panjab \[footnote 1\]
and contained 340 folios. This was an extensive paddhati with several
Kaṭha mantra-s and brāhmaṇa sections used in their late gṛhya rituals.
Another Śāradā manuscript, found in the possession of the same mulla, of
180 folios contains overlapping content from brāhmaṇa and mantra
material used in Kaṭha rituals. Finally, there was the D.A.V. college
manuscript with two parts of 189 and 169 folios respectively that was
again an extensive paddhati with overlapping material. The above
Rudra-mantra-s come in the sections labeled Rudra-mantrāḥ or
Śatādhyāya(Rudra)mantrāḥ and comprise their second division, coming
after the Śatarudrīya. The fate of these manuscripts after the
vivisection of India in 1947 CE remains unclear. In the past year, the
eGangotri trust has made freely available two independent texts which
span the mantra-s in question from the Raghunātha Mandira Sanskrit
collection, Jammu. One is a Śāradā manuscript of the Śatādhyāya-dīkṣa
and another is a print version of the Śatādhyāya produced in the 1920s
by the Kashmirian brāhmaṇa-s, Tārachanda Kaulā and Keśava Bhaṭṭa. These
have helped correct some problematic parts of the Sūryakānta texts.

The first part of this fragment is a rather important because is the
only occurrence of a variant version of this famous incantation to Rudra
found outside the Atharvaveda saṃhitā-s. The said incantation occurs as
sūkta 11.2 in the AV-vulgate (often taken to be the Śaunaka saṃhita) and
as sūkta 16.104 in the Paippalāda saṃhitā. In totality, the two AV
versions resemble each other more closely and have a more extensive set
of mantra-s. This clearly establishes that it was not a late acquisition
of the Kaṭha-s from the neighboring Paippalāda-s, who were also
prominent in the same region (e.g. the Kashmirian intellectual bhaṭṭa
Jayanta). Two further points are notable. This text is entirely
rhotacizing (e.g. arikravebhyaḥ) relative the fully or partial
lambdacizing AV saṃhitā-s (AV-vul: aliklavebhyaḥ; AV-P ariklavebhyaḥ).
On the other hand, it has mṛḷatam, mimicking the Ṛgveda dialect, instead
of the AV mṛḍatam. Similarly, this text shows the archaism of using the
RV-type dual form Bhavā-śarvā as opposed to the AV Bhavāśarvau. This was
likely originally part of the Kaṭha-mantrapāṭha which went the sūtra-s
of Laugākṣi.

It shares with the AV and Śāṅkhāyana-RV traditions, the conception of
Rudra in his twin form — Bhava and Śarva. In the Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra
(4.20.1-2), Bhava and Śarva are called the sons of Rudra Mahādeva, thus
presenting them as ectypes of the Aśvin-s, who are the sons of Rudra in
the RV \[footnote 2\] and mirror the para-Vedic Skanda-Viśākha dyad who
are coupled with Rudra (e.g. in gṛhya-pariśiṣṭa-1 of the Kauthuma
Samaveda: oṃ rudraṃ skanda-viśākhayos tarpayāmi ।). In contrast, while
Bhava and Śarva are used as epithets of Rudra in other Yajurveda
traditions (e.g. Taittirīya), they are not presented as twins. This
suggests that the the Kaṭha tradition developed in proximity to the
locale where AV traditions original diversified in which the cult of the
twins Bhava and Śarva, like that of the Greek Dioscouri, was dominant.

The second part is homologous to the equivalent section of the
Aruṇa-praśna of the Taittirīya āraṇyaka, which is used in the
Āruṇaketukacayana ritual, where the bricks of the citi are replaced by
water-filled pots. It might have been part of an equivalent lost section
of the Kaṭha brāhmaṇa. It is largely equivalent to the TA version with a
few variants that we have retained due to consistency across Kaṭha
manuscripts. Variants of the final mantra are found as AV-vulgate
7.87.1; AV-P 20.33.7 and Taittirīya saṃhitā 5.5.9.3; Kaṭha saṃhitā
40.5.33. The Kaṭha version is oddly formed and unmetrical both in the
saṃhitā and across the prayoga manuals. Hence, we retain it as is
without emendation or metrical restoration based on the other saṃhitā-s.

The Ṛgveda is replete with obscure sūkta-s but RV 10.5 might easily take
a place in the top tier of those. One might even ask why even attempt to
write a commentary on this. We admit we could be plainly wrong in
reading the words of our ancestors but the allure of attempting to
understand the recondite cannot be passed up. We know nothing of the
true composer of this sūkta for the anukramaṇi attributes it to the god
Trita Āptya, a watery deity of old IE provenance with cognates Thrita
and Thraetona Athvya in the Iranian world and Triton in the Greek world.
The sūkta itself is directed towards Agni.

ekaḥ samudro dharuṇo rayīṇām  
asmad dhṛdo bhūri-janmā vi caṣṭe \|  
siṣakty ūdhar niṇyor upastha  
utsasya madhye nihitam padaṃ veḥ \|\| 1

The one sea, the receptacle of all riches;  
he of many births from our heart looks on.  
He clings to the udder in the lap of the two hidden ones.  
In the midst of the fountain, the bird’s path is set down.

The opening ṛk is already fairly obscure. We believe the sea here is as
literal as it gets. In later Hindu tradition, the sea is seen as the
receptacle of riches and the same metaphor finds an early expression
here. Now, that sea is juxtaposed with one of many births. The deity of
the sūkta is given as Agni and there is no reason at all to doubt that —
although he is explicitly mentioned only in the final ṛk of the sūkta,
many epithets throughout the sūkta confirm him as the deity . Sāyaṇa
informs us that the many births of Agni correspond to this multiple
kindlings in the ritual altars of such as the Āhavanīya, the Gārhapatya
and the Dakṣiṇāgni in diverse yajña-s. This just one of the ways in
which Agni may be seen as having many births. Alternatively, in
mythological time he is again said to have many births — a possible
allegory for the precession of the equinoctial colure. However, the
twist in this sūkta is the “internalization” of the yajña, as Agni is
said to be in the heart of the ritualists. This takes us to the next
foot where he is said to “cling to the udder in the lap of the two
hidden ones”. Agni in the lap of the two parents can be a metaphor for
the two pieces of the ritual fire-drill or Dyaus and Pṛthivi in a cosmic
context. However, neither of them are hidden and this comes in the
context of the internalized yajña implied in the earlier foot. Hence, we
take hidden to mean something internal, probably the mind and the
intellect (which are not visible entities), whose action composes the
sūkta like Agni being generated by the fire-drill. Then in the final
foot, we come to Agni being identified as a bird and his path being set
down in the midst of the fountain. Sāyaṇa interprets this as Agni as the
lightning in the midst of the cloud. This is appears to be version of
the famous representation of Agni as Apām Napāt. However, we believe
that two distinct metaphors, one physical and one mental or internal,
are being intertwined here. The sea and the fountain are physical — they
are allusions to the famous fire in water, with the fountain as the
underwater plume associated with these fires. These sites in the Black
Sea-Caspian Sea region could have been accessed by the early
Indo-Europeans and those sightings left an impression on their
tradition.

samānaṃ nīḷaṃ vṛṣaṇo vasānāḥ  
saṃ jagmire mahiṣā arvatībhiḥ \|  
ṛtasya padaṃ kavayo ni pānti  
guhā nāmāni dadhire parāṇi \|\| 2

The virile ones dwell in the same nest,  
the buffaloes have come together with the mares,  
The kavi-s guard the seat of the natural law (ṛta),  
they have placed the highest names in concealment.

This may be interpreted as a metaphor for the feeding of the ritual fire
with oblations. The oblations are likened to the virile buffaloes, while
the mares are the tongues of Agni (seen as female Kālī, Karālī, etc).
This brings us to the famous imagery of the fire within water as the
Vaḍavāgni or the equine fire (something Sāyaṇa seems to intuitively
grasp), whose flames might be seen as the mares. The kavi-s here might
be seen as tending to Agni who is seen as the seat of the ṛta. Sāyaṇa
mentions the secret names to be Jātavedas, Vaiśvānara, etc which have
secret meanings.

ṛtāyinī māyinī saṃ dadhāte  
mitvā śiśuṃ jajñatur vardhayantī \|  
viśvasya nābhiṃ carato dhruvasya

The two imbued with the truth and illusion conjoin,  
having measured \[him\] out, the two birthed the child, making him
grow,  
\[who is the\] nave of all that moves and stands still.  
Indeed they \[the beings\] with their mind seek the connection (lit:
thread) of the kavi \[Agni\].

Here we agree with Sāyaṇa’s interpretation that it refers to the birth
of the cosmic manifestation of Agni as the sun from his parents, the two
world-hemispheres. This is mirrored in the ritual by the generation of
Agni by the two parts of the fire-drill. In this solar form, he is seen
as a nave of all that moves and moves not and connection to him is
mentally sought by all beings.

ṛtasya hi vartanayaḥ sujātam  
iṣo vājāya pradivaḥ sacante \|  
adhīvāsaṃ rodasī vāvasāne  
ghṛtair annair vāvṛdhāte madhūnām \|\| 4

For the wheel-tracks of the law, the well-born one,  
refreshing offerings, for booty, serve from the days of yore,  
the world-hemispheres having worn the mantle,  
with ghee and honeyed food augment \[the child Agni\].

Here the world halves are explicitly mentioned; this clarifies the
reference to the cosmic Agni, i.e. sun. The ṛta’s wheel-tracks, i.e.
movements of celestial bodies like the sun further build this connection
and support the rendering of ṛta as the “natural law” which is manifest
in celestial movements that have continued since the ancient days. Them
following the cosmic Agni is intertwined with the metaphor of the
ritualists seeking booty serving Agni with refreshing offerings. The
mantle of the world-halves is a likely allusion to the days and nights.

sapta svasṝr aruṣīr vāvaśāno  
vidvān madhva uj jabhārā dṛśe kam \|  
antar yeme antarikṣe purājā  
icchan vavrim avidat pūṣaṇasya \|\| 5

Desirous \[of them\], the seven shining sisters,  
the knower (Agni), held up from the honey to be seen,  
He held \[them\] up within the mid-region, the earlier born one,  
seeking a mantle, he found that of the earth.

This ṛk is rather obscure. Sāyaṇa explains the seven sisters as the
seven tongues of Agni (Kālī, Karālī, etc) that he has held up within the
mid-region for all to see. However, the celestial connection hinted at
by the sisters being held up in the sky (?) suggests that it could be an
allusion to the Kṛttikā-s (Pleiades) the asterism associated with Agni.
. However, this interpretation will not hold if we strictly take
antarikṣa to be the atmosphere. We follow Sāyaṇa to take the adjective
aruṣīḥ to mean shining rather than red (which ironically would fit his
tongues interpretation better) Further, we also follow Sāyaṇa in
interpreting the obscure word Puṣaṇa as the Earth.

sapta maryādāḥ kavayas tatakṣus  
tāsām ekām id abhy aṃhuro gāt \|  
āyor ha skambha upamasya nīḷe  
pathāṃ visarge dharuṇeṣu tasthau \|\| 6

The kavi-s have fashioned the seven boundaries,  
just to one of those the troubled one has gone,  
in the nest of the highest Āyu, the pillar  
stands in foundations \[situated\] where the paths diverge.

Sāyaṇa takes the seven maryādā-s to be ethical strictures: sins like
killing a brāhmaṇa or bedding ones teacher’s wife, beer, etc lie outside
the boundaries of proper conduct. Indeed, this moral sense appears to be
in play when the same ṛk is deployed in the Atharvan marriage ceremony:
Kauśika-sutra 10.2.21: sapta maryādāḥ \[AV-vulgate 5.1.6\] ity uttarato
.agneḥ sapta lekhā likhati prācyaḥ \| To the north of the marital ritual
fire 7 lines are drawn towards the east. Then while reciting this ṛk,
the couple places a step on these lines to signify the ethical
strictures that accompany marriage. While this implication might be the
secondary sense of the first foot, we believe that its primary sense is
distinct. In the ritual sphere, it is an allusion to the seven
paridhi-s, the firesticks which enclose the fire. These in turn appear
to be a symbolic representation of celestial “boundaries” for the
purpose of the yajñ. This implied by the yajuṣ incantation that is
recited as paridhi-s are laid down (e.g. in Taittirīya Śruti): viśvāyur
asi pṛthivīṃ dṛṃ̐ha dhruvakṣid asy antarikṣaṃ dṛṃ̐hācyutakṣid asi divaṃ
dṛṃ̐ha agner bhasmāsy agneḥ purīṣam asi \|\| This incantation is for the
rite with three paridhi-s (madhyma, uttara and dakṣiṇa). They are
respectively associated with the earth, the atmosphere and the sky. The
seven-paridhi ritual might have likewise symbolized the six realms and
the central plane of one version of vaidika cosmography (speculation).
This ṛk returns to some of the themes found in the first and second
ṛk-s. The nest and the “dharuṇa”, here meaning the foundation, are
mentioned again. Āyu, in the general sense, may be understood as the
ancestor of the pañcajana-s, the son of Pururavas and Urvaśi. However,
when Agni is seen as the fire of Āyu-s, he is called the best of the
Āyu-s. This is made explicit in the ritual context in the Yajurveda by
the incantation (e.g. in the Taittirīya Śruti): vider agnir nabho
nāmāgne aṅgiro yo .asyāṃ pṛthivyām asyāsuṣā nāmnehi … Thus, the pillar
of Agni by the name Āyu, is the skambha referred to in this ṛk. It is
said to stand in the foundation where the paths diverge. Thus, the
pillar should be understood as the axial pillar with the divergent paths
being that of the gods (the northern path) and that of Yama with the
dead (the southern path). The point of divergence is of course the
equinoctial colure which intersects the plane on which the axis stands.

asac ca sac ca parame vyoman  
dakṣasya janmann aditer upasthe \|  
agnir ha naḥ prathamajā ṛtasya  
pūrva āyuni vṛṣabhaś ca dhenuḥ \|\|

Both the unmanifest and the manifest are in the primal sky,  
Dakṣa’s birth is in the womb of Aditi,  
Agni, indeed, for us is the first borne of the law,  
in his former life both bull and cow.

This last ṛk talks of the role of Agni back in time during the
cosmogonic period by giving a summary of what is covered in the famous
cosmogonic sūkta-s, like RV 10.72 and RV 10.129. Here the unmanifest
(literally the non-existent) and the manifest all that came into being
are said to exist in that primal sky (parame vyoman) just as in RV
10.129 (the famous Nāsadīya sūkta). The generation of beings is seen as
occurring with the Āditya Dakṣa being born from Aditi (and vice versa as
per RV 10.72). This posits initial cyclical reproductions of male from
female and vice versa. But it results in an apparent paradox of who came
first, the male or the female. The ṛṣi of this sūkta tries to break the
paradox by stating that it was Agni who was the first-born entity of the
ṛta, who in that former state was androgynous. Thus, the author invokes
hermaphroditic reproduction as the ancestral state. This was also the
position of Vaiśvāmitra-s of maṇḍala-3, who present a comparable set of
cosmogonic constructs in the context of Indra and Varuṇa (RV 3.38),
emerging from the god Tvaṣṭṛ, who in some ways is like the yavana
Kronos. They are said to have partitioned the hermaphroditic ancestral
bovine into male and female, similar to Zeus and Apollo cleaving the
hermaphrodites into separate sexes in the yavana world.

The below is only for information. Parts of it should not be construed
as any kind of prognostication on our part.

The great Hindu naturalist Varāhamihira describes various kinds of
planetary conjunctions or grahayuddha-s in his Brihatsaṃhitā (chapter
17) thus:

yuddhaṃ yathā yadā vā bhaviṣyam ādiśyate trikālajñaiḥ \|  
tad vijñānaṃ karaṇe mayā kṛtaṃ sūrya-siddhānte \|\|  
The time and nature of planetary conjunctions (graha-yuddha) can be
predicted by astronomers. That science has been \[taught\] in
astronomical work composed by me \[based on\] the Sūrya Siddhānta.
\[Here he is referring to his Pañcasiddhānta\]

viyati caratāṃ grahāṇām uparyupary ātma-mārga-saṃsthānām \|  
ati-dūrād dṛg-viṣaye samatām iva samprayātānām \|\|  
The planets revolve in space in their respective orbits that are
positioned one above the other. \[However,\] due to their great
distance, when observed they appear as if revolving on the same surface
(i.e. the sky). \[Here, Varāhamihira clarifies that even though it is
called a yuddha how it must be understood in the scientific sense.\]

āsanna-krama-yogād bheda+ullekha+aṃśu+mardana+asavyaiḥ \|  
yuddhaṃ catuṣprakāraṃ parāśara ādyair munibhir uktam \|\|  
In the order of the proximity of the conjunct planets: 1. bheda
(occultation); 2. ullekha (near tangential contact); 3. aṃśumardana (the
grazing of rays); 4. asavya (apart) are the four types of conjunctions
described by Parāśara and other sages.

bhede vṛṣṭi-vināśo bhedaḥ suhṛdāṃ mahākulānāṃ ca \|  
ullekhe śastra-bhayaṃ mantrivirodhaḥ priyānnatvam \|\|  
In the bheda conjunction, there is drought and friends and persons of
great families become enemies; in the ullekha conjunction there is fear
of weapons, a rebellion of ministers, but there is \[abundance of\] good
food.

amśu-virodhe yuddhāni bhūbhṛtāṃ śastra-ruk-kṣud-avamardāḥ \|  
yuddhe ca+apy apasavye bhavanti yuddhāni bhūpānām \|\|  
In the aṃśumardana conjunction, kings go to war and people are afflicted
by weapons, disease or famine. In apasavya (asavya) conjunction, rulers
go to war.

ravir ākrando madhye pauraḥ pūrve +apare sthito yāyī \|  
paurā budha-guru-ravijā nityaṃ śītāṃśur ākrandaḥ \|\|  
The Sun in mid-heaven is \[called\] ākranda; paura in the east and when
stationed in the west a yāyin. Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn are always
paura. The Moon is always ākranda.

ketu-kuja-rāhu-śukrā yāyina ete hatā ghnanti \|  
ākranda-yāyi-paurān-jayino jayadāḥ sva-vargasya \|\|  
Ketu, Mars, Rāhu and Venus are always yāyin-s. These are either struck
(defeated) or strike (win). Depending on whether the ākranda, yāyin or
paura losses or wins the objects associated with of their respective
categories \[suffer or prosper\].

paure paureṇa hate paurāḥ paurān nṛpān vinighnanti \|  
evaṃ yāyy ākrandā nāgara-yāyi-grahāś ca+eva \|\|  
A paura defeated by another paura, results in city-dwellers and kings
being smitten. Similarly, if a yāyin or an ākranda is defeated by
another or respectively by a paura or yāyin \[the objects associated
with them are affected accordingly\].

dakṣiṇa-diksthaḥ paruṣo vepathur aprāpya sannivṛtto +aṇuḥ \|  
adhirūḍho vikṛto niṣprabho vivarṇaś ca yaḥ sa jitaḥ \|\|  
That \[planet\] which is positioned to the south, at a cusp, showing
rapid variability of brightness, goes retrograde immediately after
conjunction, with the smaller disc, occulted, gets dimmer or changes
color is said to be defeated.

ukta-viparīta-lakṣaṇa-sampanno jayagato vinirdeśyaḥ \|  
vipulaḥ snigdho dyutimān dakṣiṇadikstho +api jayayuktaḥ \|\|  
If the planet appears endowed with the appearance opposite of the
above-described it is deemed the victor. So also that which appears
bigger, smooth in the motion or brighter is considered the winner even
if stationed to the south.

dvāv api mayūkha-yuktau vipulau snigdhau samāgame bhavataḥ \|  
tatra +anyonyaṃ prītir viparītāv ātmapakṣaghnau \|\|  
If both are endowed with bright rays, growing larger and smooth moving
it becomes a samāgama conjunction. There is \[consequentially\] a
conciliation between the objects associated with the two planets; if it
is the opposite (i.e. both are small, growing dim, etc) both the
associated objects will be destroyed.

yuddhaṃ samāgamo vā yady avyaktau svalakṣaṇair bhavataḥ \|  
bhuvi bhūbhṛtām api tathā phalam avyaktaṃ vinirdeśyam \|\|  
In cases where it the characteristics are not clear as to whether the
conjunction of two planets is in a yuddha or a samāgama conjunction, it
is likewise unclear as to what the fruits will be for the rulers.

Thus, Varāhamihira describes the general omenology of planetary
conjunctions as per hoary Hindu tradition. This year is marked by a
remarkable conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn that will peak as per

This has caused tremendous fear and excitement among those with a belief
in such omenology. Even as we were examining the conjunction for purely
astronomical reasons, we received one such call from a believer. Hence,
we looked up Varāhamihira to see what he has to say. Notably, this
conjunction on Dec 21 is the closest since the famous Keplerian
conjunction of 1623 CE. Thus, it is definitely an aṃśumardana and nearly
an ullekha. From the above, we can see that, as per tradition, it is a
grahayuddha of the aṃśumardana type between two paura planets, which
prognosticates death from weapons, disease, or famine. Further, it is
evident that Jupiter is to the south and it reduces in magnitude as it
emerges from the conjunction. So as per the Hindu typology of
conjunctions, it is defeated by Saturn (Figure 2).

Figure 2

Varāhamihira further provides specific omenology for the defeat of
Jupiter by Saturn (BS 17.19):

bhaumena hate jīve madhyo deśo nareśvarā gāvaḥ \|  
saureṇa ca+arjunāyana-vasāti-yaudheya-śibi-viprāḥ \|\|  
If Jupiter is beaten by Mars, Madhyadeśa region, kings and cows suffer.
\[When beaten by\] Saturn, the Arjunāyana, Vasāti, Yaudheya, Śibi
\[peoples\] and the Brāhmaṇa-s suffer. \[It is noteworthy that one of
the used words for Jupiter in the last 2000 years is Jiva. This word is
not encountered in the earlier layers of the Sanskrit tradition. It is a
loan from Greek, the vocative declension of Zeus, and is one of the
marks of the influence of Greek astrology (e.g. the Paulīśa-siddhānta
and Yavana-jātakam) on its Indian counterpart.\]

It was that latter prognostication that caused the fear in our
interlocutor. These conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn have an
interesting geometric feature: the great trigon. For superior planets
one can approximately calculate the frequency of conjunctions thus: Let
![p_1,
p_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+p_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the periods of revolution of the two planets and ![p_2 \>
p_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_2+%3E+p_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then ![\\tfrac{360^\\circ}{p_1},
\\tfrac{360^\\circ}{p_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%7D%7Bp_1%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%7D%7Bp_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the mean angular speeds of the two planets respectively. The
difference in their speeds would be:

![\\dfrac{360^\\circ(p_2-p_1)}{p_1p_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%28p_2-p_1%29%7D%7Bp_1p_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence, the time the faster planet will take relative to the slower
planet to complete one revolution (i.e. catch up with it again) will be:

![p_c=\\dfrac{360^\\circ}{\\dfrac{360^\\circ(p_2-p_1)}{p_1p_2}} =
\\dfrac{p_1
p_2}{p_2-p_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c%3D%5Cdfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%7D%7B%5Cdfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%28p_2-p_1%29%7D%7Bp_1p_2%7D%7D+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bp_1+p_2%7D%7Bp_2-p_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This
![p_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the duration between successive conjunctions. The period of
Jupiter is 4331 days of Saturn is 10747 days. Hence, ![p_c= 7254.56 \\;
\\mathrm{days} = 19.86245\\;
\\mathrm{years}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c%3D+7254.56+%5C%3B+%5Cmathrm%7Bdays%7D+%3D+19.86245%5C%3B+%5Cmathrm%7Byears%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions will repeat approximately every 20
years. One can see that the next two conjunctions will occur with
respect to the original one at:

![\\left (p_c \\dfrac{360^\\circ}{4331} \\right ) \\mod 360 \\equiv
243.0112^\\circ; \\left (2p_c \\dfrac{360^\\circ}{4331} \\right ) \\mod
360 \\equiv
126.0224^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft+%28p_c+%5Cdfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%7D%7B4331%7D+%5Cright+%29+%5Cmod+360+%5Cequiv+243.0112%5E%5Ccirc%3B+%5Cleft+%282p_c+%5Cdfrac%7B360%5E%5Ccirc%7D%7B4331%7D+%5Cright+%29+%5Cmod+360+%5Cequiv+126.0224%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the three successive conjunctions will trace out an approximate
equilateral triangle on the ecliptic circle — the great trigon. This
trigon caught the attention of the great German astrologer [Johannes
Kepler](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/14/johannes-kepler/),
the father of the modern planetary theory in the Occident. He described
this in his work the “De Stella Nova in Pede Serpentarii” that announced
the discovery of his famous supernova. Since the successive trigons are
not exactly aligned, they will progress along the ecliptic (Figure 3).
We see that after 40 successive conjunctions it occurs very close to the
original conjunction ![\\approx
0.4488778^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+0.4488778%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3). This amounts to about 290182.4 days (794.4979 years). This
is the roughly 800 cycle that Kepler was excited about and thought that
he was in the 8th such cycle since the creation of the world (being
conditioned by one of the West Asian diseases of the mind).

![jupiter_saturn](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/jupiter_saturn.png)  
Figure 3. Progression of the trigons in the cycle of 40

The above formula can also be used to calculate the successive
oppositions (when the configuration is Sun–Earth–superior planet) or
inferior conjunctions (Earth–inferior planet–Sun) or superior
conjunctions (Earth-Sun-inferior planet). We those obtain other
interesting patterns. One such is successive oppositions of Jupiter
which happen every 398.878 days. Thus, they nearly inscribe a hendecagon
on the ecliptic circle (Figure 4).

[![jupiter_hendecagon](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/jupiter_hendecagon.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/jupiter_hendecagon.png)Figure
4. Successive oppositions of Jupiter

Now the successive inferior or superior conjunctions of Venus happen
every 583.9578 days. Thus, these successive events trace out a near
pentagonal star (Figure 5). This comes from the fact the ratio of the
orbital periods of Earth to Venus is nearly
![\\tfrac{13}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B13%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is a convergent of the Golden Ratio.

5. Successive conjunctions of Venus

Beyond this, we may also note that the successive oppositions of Saturn
nearly inscribe a 28-sided polygon (roughly corresponding to one per
nakṣatra) whereas those of Mars nearly inscribe a polygon of half that
number (14 sides). The minor planet Ceres nearly inscribes an 18-sided
star in the ecliptic circle (Figure 6).

The generalized [Lozi
map](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/)
is a good way to illustrate the cosine principle and the radial effects
(in lay circles to which I belong in this regard, as opposed to
mathematicians). The generalized Lozi map is a 2-dimensional map defined
thus:

![x\_{n+1}= 1 + y_n +
a\|x_n\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+1+%2B+y_n+%2B+a%7Cx_n%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=
-x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+-x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The map is area-preserving and yields “aesthetic” images for ![a \\in
\[-0.6,1.1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+%5B-0.6%2C1.1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Additionally, values ![a=-1;
a=\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1%3B+a%3D%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are also somewhat aesthetic and interesting. We have previously
described the [cosine
principle](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/a-novel-discrete-map-exhibiting-chaotic-behavior/)
for various dynamical systems, but we reiterate it here for the
generalized Lozi map as it is one of the easiest ones to explain to a
layperson. First, a few words on how we visualize this map. We start
with the vertices of a 60-sided polygon circumscribed by a circle of
radius
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
centered at
![(0,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
and record the evolution of each vertex for a 1000 iterations under the
map. Since the map has an absolute value term, it will be bilaterally
symmetric along the line
![y=-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, we rotate the iterates by an angle of
![-\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
then scale and center the points, and plot the evolutes of each vertex
(orbit of the vertex) in a different color. The examples of 9 such
mappings starting with the said polygon in a circle of radius
![r=0.2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are shown in Figure 1.

[![Lozi1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi1.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi1.png)

Figure 1

The values of of the parameter are chosen such that
![a=2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![p,q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Cq&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are integers. We observe that the value of
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
determines a key aspect of the shape of the map, i.e. in each map there
is a central, largely excluded area that takes the form of a polygon
with
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-sides.
This is the cosine principle. More generally, the shape of the central
region of the map is determined by the
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to the
![2\\cos(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ccos%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
closest to
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Note that for the case
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we take a number relatively close to 0, for at 0 the map is degenerate.
Outside of the polygonal exclusion zone, we may find chaotic behavior
but it is still bounded within a unique external shape. The chaos is
particularly apparent in the cases when ![a=-1; 1;
\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1%3B+1%3B+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when the map respectively yields the headless gingerbread man, the
classical gingerbread man and the tripodal gingerbread man strange
attractors. At the other values of
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we see bands of chaos interspersed with rings of closed loops that
resemble the period-doubling phenomenon in other strange attractors
prior to the outbreak of full-fledged chaos.

In Figure 2 we produce the same plot by changing the radius of the
circumscribing circle of the initial polygon to
![r=0.45](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.45&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can see that at this radius, for the low
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the cosine principle remains dominant, but for large
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the polygonal zone gets “smoothened” out (e.g. for
![p=9..11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D9..11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
This indicates the radial principle, i.e. the effect of the starting
radius on the degree of expression of the cosine principle in the map.

[![Lozi2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi2.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi2.png)

Figure 2

The degree of chaos can be seen as the measure of entropy of the map. By
following the colors, one can see that when ![a=-1; 1;
\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1%3B+1%3B+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the orbits of a given starting vertex under the map are all over the
place within the attractor boundary. In contrast, for the other values
of
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the evolutes are mostly limited to particular bands. When ![a \\approx
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Capprox+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the evolute of each vertex is limited to a certain concentric
curve. Thus, the former lie at the high end of the entropy spectrum and
the latter at the low end. A proxy for the entropy distribution of the
attractor can be obtained by computing the coefficient of variation,
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the distances of
the evolutes of a particular vertex from the center of the map:

![c=\\dfrac{\\sigma_d}{\\mu_d}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csigma_d%7D%7B%5Cmu_d%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![\\sigma_d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma_d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the standard deviation and
![\\mu_d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the mean distance from the center

We plot
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the maps with
![r=0.2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1) and
![r=0.45](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.45&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2) for each vertex at 60 angles from
![0..2\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0..2%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
respectively in Figures 3 and 4. The mean
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is shown as
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for each plot.

We note that
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for ![a=-1; 1;
\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D-1%3B+1%3B+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is significantly (an order of magnitude) greater than the
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
those for the other
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, the radial effect can also be seen affecting the entropy of a
map. While it remains roughly the same or is lower for the high entropy
triangular, hexagonal and octagonal
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
for the remaining polygonal
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the entropy rises at
![r=0.45](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.45&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
relative
![r=0.2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In the pentagonal case, it is mostly across the board while we see
specific peaks in the decagonal and heptagonal case.

We next examine the radial effect and entropy more systematically for a
fixed value of
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by choosing the hendecagonal value
![a=2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{11/3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B11%2F3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The map is shown in Figure 5 and the entropy proxy
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Figure 6.

[![Lozi5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/lozi5.png)Figure

![entropy5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/entropy5.png)Figure

Here we see two disconnected effects of the radius. First, at certain
values the inner hendecagon is lost (e.g.
![r=0.1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
or becomes smoothened out (e.g. ![r=0.5;
0.6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0.5%3B+0.6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Second, the entropy of the orbits of certain vertices dramatically rises
for some values (e.g. ![r=
0.5..0.8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D+0.5..0.8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
The radial effect on neither the entropy nor the expression of the
polygonal inner zone is the same across different
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values. However, more generally, the lower the number of polygon sides,
stronger is the polygonal expression across
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Finally, we touch upon a general philosophical point that can be
realized from such chaotic systems. While it is not specific to this
generalized Lozi attractor, we take this opportunity to articulate it
because we have presented the entropy concept. Most people agree that
the attractors with neither too much entropy nor too little entropy are
aesthetically most pleasing. This also has a counterpart in biology.
Selection tends to prefer systems with an optimal entropy. Too much
entropy in a structure (say a protein) and it is too disordered to be
useful for most functions. Too little entropy and it is again too rigid
to be useful for much. Moreover, from an evolvability viewpoint, too
rigid a structure offers too little option for exploring multiple
functions in biochemical function space. Too much disorder again means
that it explores too much space to perform any function well enough to
be selected. Hence, structures with some entropy optimum tend to be
selected rather than those with minimum or maximum entropy. Selection
can be conceived as maximizing a certain function, say
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for simplicity, in a given entity under selection. This
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will then be the fitness function. We can see from the above that
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cannot directly or inversely track mean entropy because that will not
maximize fitness which is at some optimal entropy. It has to hence track
something else. This would depend on the optimal band of entropy that is
selected by the given constraints. For example, one field of constraints
could select for an optimal band of mean
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
like ![\\mu \\in \[0.03,
0.1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+%5Cin+%5B0.03%2C+0.1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Such a field will select
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to the pentagon, heptagon, nonagon and decagon while
avoiding the triangle, hexagon and octagon for too high entropy and the
square and hendecagon for too low entropy (Figure 1, 3). This constraint
field will also select for other values (e.g. Figures 7 and 8) that have
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is in this interval (Panels 1, 2, 6). Thus, the
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be a function with local peaks that is very different from the
underlying reality of a continuous entropy distribution from low to
high. Thus, selection translates the underlying reality into a sensed
structure very different from it. The philosophical corollary to this is
that a sensed structure will be different from and unlikely to reflect
the underlying reality.

**1 On big brains**  
An occidentally conditioned person remarked that “we were making bad use
of the great brains we have evolved. Instead of using it for human
betterment, we were expending it on killing each other with
sophisticated weapons.” I could not but help smiling for we have long
held that t[he recent explosive growth of brain size in humans is a
likely signal of evolution due to biological
conflict](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/the-upper-story-in-a-few-pictures/).
Thus, we posit (like others who have independently done so) that
intraspecific and interspecific (e.g. with australopithecines, *Homo
naledi*, Neanderthals, Denisovans and the like over time) conflict led
to the escalation of brain growth in human lineages. After we emerged as
victors against our related species and eventually settled down as
farmers, we began a transition to domestication along with the animals
we had allowed to survive as domesticates for our needs. In course of
this domestication, it looks as though our brain size came down a notch.
Paralleling this, domestication in other animals also appears to have
caused a reduction in their brain sizes. In some cases, we see strong
evidence that this arose from the reduction in conflict. This
possibility was noticed early on by Charles Darwin himself: “ …no animal
is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely
any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit…” This has since
been confirmed by a modern study, which showed that the domestication of
the rabbit resulted in: 1) reduction in brain size relative to body
size; 2) a reduction in the amygdala and an enlargement of the medial
prefrontal cortex; 3) reduction in white matter throughout the brain
\[footnote 1\]. These changes have been proposed to result in a
decreased flight response in the domestic rabbit. Similarly, the
domestic pig and probably also the domestic cat and dog have smaller
brains than their wild counterparts. We saw a poignant illustration of
this in the form of a domesticated white lab mouse that had escaped from
the lab was savoring its newfound freedom. However, its lack of smarts
for life in the wild quickly made it a victim for a crow couple. Thus,
if the brain of an organism is an instrument in an arms-race, the
brain-size and the level of ambient biological conflict have a
positively correlated relationship. More generally, “losing the martial
edge” from domestication has also been seen on a civilizational scale —
for example, among the steppe peoples who transitioned to a sedentary
existence.

We do not as yet fully understand all the reasons why large-brained
organisms arose repeatedly among those with smaller brains. But once it
is in place, biological conflict can keep it growing in size. Several
birds on islands are renowned for their intelligence and might have even
bigger brains than their mainland counterparts \[footnote 2\]. At the
face of it, it might look paradoxical — an island usually has less
danger from predation and related conflicts than the mainland: think of
the flightlessness of the dodo or the solitaire. One hypothesis that
explains this is the opening of new niches on the island to the
colonizer, which increases intra-specific competition as its population
expands. Given the potential habitat and resource diversity, or
difficulty in accessing the latter on the island, the plasticity of
behavior and therefore a larger brain can be decisive in the
intra-specific conflict. An example of the use of a larger brain in
exploiting difficult resources is seen in the case of the cane toad
introduced to Australia. The toxic toad kills species like the
*Varanus*lizard that eat it resulting in a major decline in their
populations. On the other hand, the big-brained Torresian crow has
learned to rip it apart and eat it from the ventral side and thus avoid
its poison glands. Thus, the rise of smarter birds on islands via
intra-specific conflict could be related to the phenomenon that drove
the expansion of the human brain.

Recent studies providing constraints on the distribution of earth-like
exo-planets suggest that there must be ![\\le 6 \\times
10^9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle+6+%5Ctimes+10%5E9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
stars with Earth-like planets in the Milky Way. This is a large enough
number that it brings home the reality of Fermi’s paradox: “If there are
extra-solar system civilizations why have we not heard from them yet?”
One noted astronomer suggested that this might mean that human-type
intelligence is likely to be exceptional across the Milky Way. We take a
slightly more nuanced view informed by biology with regards to the
reality of Fermi’s paradox. It is clear that most organisms that
profoundly modify their host planet might not do so with any intention
of signaling to life forms on other planets. For example, cyanobacteria
altered the earth and made its atmosphere oxidizing resulting in a whole
lot of new dioxygen chemistry that made organisms like ourselves
possible. Cyanobacterial metabolites might signal the presence of life
to an observer on another planet, but this is hardly intentional.
Similarly, William Hamilton, just before his death, proposed that the
bacteria might have \`caused’ the emergence of atmospheric clouds to
disperse themselves or their spores. While this might seem far-fetched
at first sight, since the work by Sands we have known that bacteria can
nucleate clouds and ice (e.g. *Pseudomonas syringae*). More recently,
the role of marine bacteria in seeding Arctic clouds has been
demonstrated \[Footnote 3\]. Thus, there might be an “agency” on part of
the bacteria in visibly modifying the planetary atmosphere to facilitate
their spread. However, while it is likely that bacteria-like forms can
effectively signal the presence of life on a planet through more than
one means, they do not seem to be doing so with the intent of informing
aliens. This kind of signaling seems to need a large centralized brain
of the kind we have. Such brains are only present in animals among
earthly life and have evolved only a few times in the past 700-1000
million years animals have been on this earth: cephalopods, some
lineages of avian dinosaurs, some placental mammals. While we might not
fully understand why a lineage evolves a bigger brain than its sister
groups in the first place, a major driver of escalating growth appears
to be biological conflicts. Thus, on other planets too we expect
brain-like structures to evolve if they were to provide an edge in the
arms race rather than for signaling to aliens. Its growth will be driven
by the arms race and not the need for space exploration. Further, if
auto-domestication happens as a consequence it might eventually decline
in size. Thus, auto-domestication might be seen like how yogin-s
described siddhi-s — they come as byproducts but focusing on them can
take you down from the goal of yoga.

We have had the unique distinction of being born in the age of space
exploration. Some people, inspired by the excitement of it, have
remarked that space exploration might provide selective advantages by
allowing the colonization of new planets; hence, intelligent life should
eventually turn to such an endeavor. We take a dimmer view. First, we
believe such colonization might be an option for the basal
prokaryote-like life forms that are likely to widely populate the
universe. It might not be necessarily intentional but, like the seeding
of clouds and ice on earth by bacteria, certain adaptations might have
facilitated such escape and transmission especially in the earlier days
of the solar star cluster, and its cognates throughout the Milky Way.
However, for larger big-brained organisms like ourselves both the
physics and the biology make such prospects of such a gain fairly
unlikely. For the most part, space exploration is a byproduct of the
development of weapon delivery and surveillance systems, like rockets
and satellites, which actually mean something for the conflicts (i.e.
dual-use technology). Once the utility of space exploration for the main
product declines, the interest in space exploration for its own sake
will also be limited. In the best case, we could have many intelligent
civilizations that are “mining” nearby planetary bodies for various
resources that give them an edge. Thus, we would say that Fermi’s
paradox should be taken as the null hypothesis because theory predicts
that the primary driver of big brain-like structures would be biological
conflicts on the host planet, and space exploration would merely be its
rare sideshow.

Finally, we should note that a big brain is also a big memetic ecosystem
where viral [pathological memes can take
root](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/).
This probably goes hand-in-hand with domestication, which releases some
of the strong survival pressure that an organism faces in a natural
environment. For instance, on the wild steppe one has to ensure that
food is available to tide through the harsh winter months. This cuts out
a lot of the avenue for slacking. In contrast, in a city with a
well-provisioned supermarket supplying soft syrupy viands at an arm’s
reach and a low price takes the mind away from survival and allows for
slacking. Against this background, the emergence of diseases, like
[American
Naxalism](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-days-the-fizz-is-out-of-the-bottle/),
which would otherwise reduce survivorship, can take root and thrive.
These new diseases of the mind along with their ancestral versions, i.e.
the unmāda-s from West Asia can eventually recycle the civilizational
state back to a more basic condition. Thus, the civilizational state we
are in would cycle up and down without for the most part reaching out to
life on other planets. The same would hold for them too.

**2 The parasite within**  
Small genomes, like those of small RNA or DNA viruses (e.g. the SV40
virus), are lean and mean. They code for little else beyond a minimal
apparatus to replicate their own nucleic acid and the bare essential
apparatus to take hold of the host systems for producing more of
themselves. In contrast, large viruses, like say a poxvirus, a
mimivirus, a pithovirus or a *Bacillus* virus G have giant genomes. In
addition to the replication apparatus, they code for a transcription
system, and have a degree of self-sufficiency and independence from the
host systems. They code for several elaborate means to more subtly
hijack and control the host in several ways. While the former class
primarily depends on fast replication of their little genomes to
overwhelm the host or at least get some copies of themselves made before
the host immunity overwhelms them, the latter is a different type of
player. They do not replicate as fast but compete hard with the host
while taking their own time to replicate their relatively large genomes
accurately. This means that they code for a diverse array of capacities
to keep the host immunity at bay even as they assemble their elaborate
copy-making machinery inside the host cell. A curious thing about such
larger viral genomes is that they invariable carry parasites within
their own genomes. These may take the form of introns, inteins, and
other mobile parasitic genetic elements that invade the genome and the
genes of the bigger viruses. The inteins and introns have been selected
to mediate their own splicing either at the level of the protein or the
RNA transcript. Thus, they do not fatally cripple their host. However,
they lodge themselves in genes like the DNA polymerase; hence, the
host-virus simply cannot get rid of these genomic parasites. Thus, it is
given that as genome sizes grow beyond a certain point, where they shift
to the paradigm of slower replication and harder competition, parasitic
elements make their home in them.

We have wondered if this phenomenon extends beyond nucleic acid
replicators. The bloated Microsoft and Adobe Software come to mind.
Another possible example is the growth of the LaTeX system. Thus, one
would expect that large complexes of memes are likely to be invaded by
smaller memetic parasites that they cannot get rid of. Similarly,
generationally transmitted social structures and strategies (overlapping
with memes) could also become home to freeloading smaller parasitic
systems. We first got a hint of its wider relevance from governmental
bureaucracies, where you find various, “inserts” whose absence would
make little difference to the functioning of the system. We then
observed the same within the otherwise robust structure of religions.
This would appear to be particularly so to a pure mīmāṃsaka for whom
every word in religion goes towards a ritual injunction. Thus, the
presence of extraneous stuff, what he may dismiss as “arthavāda”, would
be seen mostly as such textual freeloaders transmitting themselves much
like an intron or an intein in a genome. This comparison led us to
realize that even as the larger genomes might not be able to rid
themselves of such freeloading genetic material, these other systems
like texts or bureaucracies might also not be able to do so. Why? one
might ask, should selection not purge them? First, as we saw with the
inteins in the DNA polymerase, the cost of purging them might be higher
than letting them remain if some kind of “compromise” is reached.
Sometimes a cost against purging is imposed by an “addiction module”
(e.g. in toxin-antitoxin systems). Here, the intein splices itself and
thus make sure the DNA polymerase is functional after all. Second, the
robustness of the invaded systems might smear the effect of selection
into a band rather than a discrete line — therefore within that given
band, the variability (e.g. presence or absence of a freeloading genetic
parasite) results in no selectable difference in fitness. This implies
that the freeloaders can stay on as long as the cost imposed by their
persistence mechanisms does not exceed the allowed bandwidth. While we
began our example by comparing large viral genomes to small ones, this
is taken to an extreme in cellular genomes. The self-splicing machinery
of the introns was built into a more complex spliceosomal machinery that
confers a certain resistance to introns for the cellular genomes. On the
intron side, it allowed them to spread relatively benignly — freeloaders
but not imposing a cost enough to derail the system. In ciliates, we see
another such “compromise arrangement” taken to an extreme. The cellular
RNAi machinery together with the transposases from some of the
freeloading elements ensure that a functional “cellular genome” from
which they are excised is put together in the macronucleus. However,
they are passed on for posterity via the micronucleus where they remain
intact but inert.

The relationship between the selfish elements and the cellular genomes
is even more complicated: we have shown that transcription factors that
regulate gene expression and transcription regulatory elements to which
they bind repeatedly evolve from the freeloading mobile elements. So
over evolution, they offer raw material for innovation. Sometimes they
provide new weaponry for pathogenic organisms and new defensive
strategies for cells against other invaders. On the other side, they
might breakout to give rise to new viruses. Thus, viruses like
retroviruses share an ultimate common ancestry with freeloaders like
introns. Other mobile genomic parasites have similarly given rise to
viruses such as adenoviruses. Thus, over evolutionary time these
freeloaders come with both downsides and upsides. In an environment
where the system robustness allows them to be accommodated within the
bandwidth allowed by selection, they will persist and end up conferring
some advantages to the host genomes that maintain them as opposed to
those that do not.

We wondered if the social analogs of genetic systems might have a
similar two-sided relationship with respect to freeloaders. One might
protest that memes are fine but how can social systems be analogized? We
say that even if the mapping is not exact, these can be usefully brought
into the orbit of generalized genetic systems (much like the proposed
replication of clays). While we are not sufficiently motivated to
describe this in full here, we try to illustrate it by example. In
essence, it may be seen as a meme or its variant. Take a social system
like a government. Various positions interact in a network like a
network of genes in different functional ensembles: the Department of
Defense, the Department of Biotechnology, the Judiciary, etc. which
house within them various positions. Now, the individuals occupying a
given position can be seen as fungible, e.g. a judge position can be
filled by another person, but the position remains. So, it can be seen
as copying itself on that fungible substrate. It can expand too: the
same organization can be reproduced recursively from state to state. In
the least, the comparison made us realize that certain things that
people get very worked up by, such as apparently non-functional and
corrupt positions in a bureaucracy, are likely to arise organically and
will not go away easily. They might possess “addiction modules” like
toxin-antitoxin systems that bring the system down if an eviction is
attempted. Further, if there is strong selection that forces them to
become extinct it might also bring down other aspects of the
organization that are considered useful. We cannot rule out that over
evolutionary time some of the social freeloading positions (e.g.
positions relating to some branches of the humanities academia) offer
selective advantages to the system in certain environments. On the other
hand, such social positions can also provide the raw material for the
emergence of destructive elements that are more like viruses (e.g.
certain policing, religious and academic positions in society).

**3 War and innovation**  
There is a fractal structure to the organization of space. As a result,
we have few blue whales and elephants and lots and lots of bacteria.
Consequently, many more biological conflicts play out among bacteria —
there is a non-stop warfare between different bacteria and also between
bacteria and their viruses. These battles are life-and-death struggles —
as an old English tyrant gleefully remarked about how no quarter was
offered to the Hindus in the war of 1857 CE, so it is in these battles
fought by bacteria — “kill or get killed’’ is the name of the game. As a
result, natural selection has produced an extraordinary repertoire of
weaponry. We have shown that these bacterial conflicts are at the root
of all innovation in biology. The origin of eukaryotes was marked by
some revolutionary structural adaptations that rendered them immune to
some of the weaponry used in these conflicts. For example, the dominance
of the tailed bacteriophage was passé in eukaryotes. Eukaryotes mostly
do without weaponry like restriction-modification and CRISPR systems.
Thus, the armaments of the old-world suddenly came to a stop in the
eukaryotic realm. Notable, the eukaryotic reorganization also meant that
they were going to less innovative not just in terms of weaponry but
more generally in terms of inventing new stuff. Yet, eukaryotes show
remarkable systems innovations: where does this come from? What we found
was that they get most of their innovation from the “weapons systems” of
bacteria through lateral gene transfer and reuse them mostly as
“peacetime technology” for various cellular systems like their chromatin
structure, RNA-processing, signaling inside and between cells,
multicellularity, etc. and also their own defense needs. This brought
home an important point that without the pressure of warfare there will
be no fancy peacetime technology.

In human endeavor, we see this in the form of various technologies,
including space exploration and medicine, being driven by the military
needs as the engine of innovation. Hence, we suggest that the utopian
society of peaceniks would cease to innovate meaningful technology.
However, it is conceivable it turns its mind towards making technology
that is primarily of the form of addictions that might eventually render
it supine before a more robust culture from within or without.

**4 The eternal struggle**  
One major difference between the Abrahamistic counter-religions of the
Messianic variety and the Indo-European religions is the single endpoint
utopianism preached by the former. This is the driving force behind its
secular mutations, including that in whose grip the modern Occident is
currently convulsing. In contrast, at least since the breakup between us
and our Iranian cousins (of the Zoroastrian flavor), both sides had
ingrained in them the concept of the eternal or repeated episodic
struggle of the deva-s and asura-s. It probably was already present in
the ancestral matrix of the religion. On the Iranian side, Zarathustra
caricatures it in the form of the lands the āirya-s being repeatedly
invaded by Angra Mainyu. In fact, this dualism is very important to the
philosophy of the Zoroastrian branch of the Iranians. On our side, the
Mahābhārata and the purāṇa-s emphasize the repeated cycles of the
devāsura-saṃgrāma with neither side gaining total victory. Individual
victories might be achieved: Namuci, Vṛtra, Naraka, Prahlāda, Andhaka,
and so on might be eliminated but new ones arise. Most importantly,
right from the brāhmaṇa texts, we have the emphasis on different upāya-s
being used by either side to gain victory; in each new round, a new
upāya is needed for victory. Through the teachings of the diverse
upāya-s, the brāhmaṇa texts lay out important teachings for humans in
daily life. We hold that the devāsura-saṃgrāma is one of the most
important teachings of our tradition and a mythic codification of one of
the highest realizations of the Indo-Iranians. It essentially tells us
the truth of nature — the eternal struggle — like between prey and
predator or virus and host or producer and consumer. For example,
[T4-like bacteriophages and bacteria have been fighting it out for more
than 2 billion
years](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/),
which from long before the Pleiades existed in the sky. Thus, this
battle is eternal, and each round can be won by a new upāya which
becomes part of the genetic record, much the upāya-s recorded in the
brāhmaṇa passages. New ūpāya-s may be discovered which supersede old
ones, much like the brāhmaṇa telling us of how the old performance of a
ritual might be replaced by a new brahmavāda. The Hindu-s need to pay
heed to this teaching. Just as cellular life and the viruses are locked
in eternal conflict, so also are we with counter-religious viruses of
the mind. They will mutate and new forms will arise, and we have to keep
trying new upāya-s. There will be losses, but the end goal is not to
become extinct — one cannot avoid losses entirely. Thus, rather than
hoping for a utopia to be ushered in, like that wished for by our
enemies upon our total destruction under a leader like the āmir al
momīn, we have to be prepared for round after round of saṁgrāma.

The summer of the year after the tumultuous events, Lootika and Somakhya
were traveling to visit their parents. They were supposed to attend the
marriage of Somakhya’s cousin Saumanasa but they found social
engagements with a subset of the clan quite wearisome. Thankfully, a
perfect excuse appeared for them to give it the slip, and they returned
to their parents’ city after Somakhya’s parents had left for
Kshayadrajanagara for the marriage. Thus, Somakhya was staying with his
in-laws till his parents returned. The morning after they had arrived
Lootika had risen early and left to give a talk at the university and
then engage in some sartorial explorations with her old friend
Kalakausha and her friend’s sister Kallolini. Somakhya after finishing
his morning rituals sauntered into the kitchen to chat with Lootika’s
mother who was busy at her cooking.

LM: “May Savitṛ grant success to your ritual. I’m sort of envious of
your mother. She is lighting fast in the kitchen like that legendary
English surgeon Liston but unlike him rather infallibly consistent.”  
S: “You must tell her that…”  
LM: “I did but I had to clarify that it was a compliment as I went on to
narrate to her the enthusiastic \`lopaharṣaṇa of the English surgeon.”  
S: “I’d be happy to help if I could speed things up for you in any
way.”  
LM: “Don’t be stupid and just stand there just outside the kitchen and
chat with me while I wrap this up. I am substituting for your mother at
the temple of Rudra by the river for today’s exposition and could pick
your brain a bit for that.”  
S: “Sure. You’re no different from your daughter in keeping everyone out
of your ‘pāka-yajña’.”  
LM: “Ask your mother; she would agree too! We certainly believe that too
many cooks, especially the guys, spoil the broth. Moreover, we are a bit
paranoid over the purity of our yajña-kṣetra.”

S: “So, what have you all been expounding at the temple?”  
LM: “Your mother does the Bhagvadgītā. But as you know, over the years
I’ve come over to your side. Little Lootika and I had a tiff after she
was lambasted by a learned Uttaramīmāṃsā anchorite for aggressively
upholding the doctrine of the owl, which evidently you had introduced to
her. You may recall that while talking about this incident when we were
visiting your place, your father had brought to our attention that the
last common ancestor he and I shared had written a text in 1657 CE
titled the Ulūkāvabodhanam, expounding the great doctrine. Since then I
started studying the doctrine more closely and came over to position
closer to you kids. Hence, I introduced it to the audience by way of
some variety.”  
S: “I’m always inspired by its opening: nama ulūkāya rudrāya aṇuvide
\|”  
LM: “I can see that, my dear. It is indeed that opening story that I
narrated to them — where Rudra appeared in the form of an owl to teach
the doctrine to the great Kāśyapa. In any case, other than that, at some
point when all of you kids were out of home, we also combined our
efforts to start a second course, a purāṇa exposition. While there are
many expositors of Vaiṣṇava-bhakti themes, we decided to go off the
beaten track and have readings from the old Skandapurāṇa — to our
surprise, it has gathered much greater interest than the philosophical
one. It was in that regard that I needed to consult with you regarding
the tale of how Skanda helped his mother in creating Vināyaka.”

Somakhya and Lootika’s mother continued on the topic of her intended
exposition until she was done with her cooking and she asked Somakhya to
get ready for lunch in a short while. Just then, Lootika and her
companions arrived home and Lootika reintroduced them to Somakhya,
reminding him of the long past days when they had first met. Then they
performed a namaskāra to Lootika’s mother, who asked them to stay on for
lunch; Kalakausha and Kallolini said they had to be in the hospital
shortly but agreed to take some packed food along from her. Lootika’s
mother admonished them to eat properly and on time. Just as they were at
the gate to leave, Kallolini remarked: “Our history teacher from school
periodically asks about you all. She remarked that she would like to
talk to you, Lootika or your husband, or one of your sisters, whenever
you’ll are in the city. I think it is something specific that she might
want to talk about. Please meet her if you get the chance and are so
inclined. It might really help her.” Saying so, the two ladies sped
away. After they had left, Lootika’s mother remarked: “These kids of
humble provenance have come a long way. Lootika, they often recognize
the role you and your sisters played in the process of raising them from
an unimaginative ground state to aspiring to be part of the elite.
Kallolini was quite close to Varoli just like her sister to you in the
old school. So, at some point, when their financial status improved
enough to afford the school bus, they transferred her to your school as
Varoli’s classmate.” L: “Dear mom, I suspect you ascribe more than a
required role to nurture in their case. I think there was some spark
that came together in them by the churn of genetics despite their
plebeian roots; without that our inspiration would have amounted to
nothing. Moreover, there is not much friendship between asamāna-s; the
fact that they could get along with us without a display of vulgarity
indicates some deeper saṃskāra in them.” LM: “You would know better.
Though, I must remark that Kallolini did even better than Kalakausha in
the entrance exams. I guess that was because Varoli and Jhilli could
directly help her with the intricacies of science and math. She was my
student in college, and she was not bad at all. Maybe some vāsana from a
past janman.”

L: “What is the deal with our old history teacher? As Somakhya would
say, most of the teachers and the classmates from school with whom we
have lost contact have passed out of our ken like vāsāṃsi jīrṇāni.”  
LM: “Somakhya, do you recall anything of your interactions with her? I
remember that she was generally, good to my other three daughters, but
was among the multiple teachers who would repeatedly complain to me that
your wife is rather arrogant due to her varied knowledge that was so
atypical of the girls.”  
Somakhya looked at Lootika and chuckled: “Actually, she was one of those
teachers who was not bad to me at all. She had a Nehruvian bent of mind
and liked to downplay the sultanate or the Mogol tyranny and boost the
English superiority over our culture. That said, she was rather generous
to me and I’d say to Spidery too when we pressed the counterpoints to
these issues in class. But why would she want to see us? So much has
gone by and we should have passed out of her memory too.”  
LM: “I don’t know for sure, but I have a bit of gossip in her regard.
Her husband, a lawyer, disappeared one day without warning and nobody
ever found him dead or alive. Since then she has been rather beaten down
and comes to the Śivālaya to attend your mom and my expositions. She has
aged rapidly and looks bent. Hence, we did not recognize her right away.
One day, Kallolini brought her up to us after the exposition and asked
if we knew who she was. While I was struggling to place her face, your
mother correctly called her out. She told us the tale of her husband’s
sudden vanishing. It was then that we remembered that we had encountered
that story in the news but had not connected it to her. It looked as
though she wanted to say something more in that regard but then
hesitated and went quiet. Then she asked about you kids and when she
could see you all. She periodically keeps pressing your mother and me
about that very point. I never made much of it and simply took it to be
some form of a polite inquiry.”  
Lootika waded in: “I sensed that Kallolini seemed to know something
more; I was about to ask but they ran away. I’ll call her and ask.”  
LM: “Lootika, you can be so callous! They would be busy with patients.”

An orthogonal thought running through Somakhya’s mind made him change
the topic inadvertently as he thanked his mother-in-law for the
bhiṇḍītaka dish she had made: “This brings pleasant old memories. You
may not know this but now I can say this freely. This was the first dish
Lootika ever shared with me. I remember the day clearly — there was a
torrential downpour; hence, we had the misfortune of needing to eat in
the school halls. I always dreaded that, as one would invariably end up
eating in the vicinity of someone with the wafting odors of abhojya
food. We were also supposed to be preparing for the talent show that was
in the coming week and we had a couple of periods off after lunch.
Several of our schoolmates had already begun doing so during the lunch
break itself in the front of the hall. Therefore, I retired to the last
bench of the hall and still not feeling like eating due to the odors in
the surroundings and continued working on the unusual small
serine-peptidase chaperone domain of tailed bacteriophages that I had
recently uncovered. It was then that Lootika sneaked up to sit beside me
and shared this dish with me. We spoke of what I was doing and that
sparked a remarkable idea in her head for creating a biotechnological
reagent. Taking advantage of the free time, we worked out that idea to
completion. She eventually did make it a reality in the lab and used it
effectively.” Blushing a bit, Lootika remarked as though to distract
away from the story: “It remains a useful weapon in our armory for the
purification of functional proteins.” LM: “Lootika, no wonder you asked
me to make this today. Now I know its link to your romance…”

Lootika’s parents were much like Somakhya’s parents — they felt one
should not tarry long at useless conversations. Lootika’s mother got up
abruptly and remarked: “Dear kids, I need to get ready to go and teach a
couple of classes at the college before I return to leave for the
temple. You can keep lazing around here for some time but if you want to
meet your old teacher you may either go and see her at school where she
would be correcting answer sheets or you can come with me to the temple
and catch her there. I suggest the former for that might give you some
more time and also still be in a mostly public place. I somehow get the
vibe that you should not meet her at her home.”  
L: “Why so mom?”  
LM: “Dear, do as I say. If you need a ride back home call me or dad and
we can pick the two of you up while returning. You can tell me of your
encounter then or tonight.” Saying so Lootika’s mother left.

After her mother left, Somakhya and Lootika napped a bit to clear their
jet lag. As they were waking up Lootika remarked: “Somakhya, I have a
gut feeling that there might be something interesting with the case of
our former history teacher. I sensed something in Kallolini’s words and
also my mother’s strange remark. Moreover, why would she want to meet
us? As you remarked, whatever she might have complained behind my back,
she was not bad to us in class, but neither were we particularly
memorable to her or to those of our classmates whom we mutually found
uninteresting.” Lootika then tugged Somkhya’s hand: “I must say that I
also feel some vague uneasiness about this.” Somakhya hugged her:
“varārohe, at least she was not one of those teachers who complained
that you spent too much time with the boys but I agree there might be
something more than the mundane here. Let us go and see her at school.”

Soon the two of them got ready and took the relatively long walk back to
their old school reminiscing about the happier and adventurous side of
the old days. As they walked along, they paused at the spots where they
had discussed memorable old findings like the primases of viruses, the
RNA-modifying enzymes they had put on the map and the like. The place
had changed quite a bit since they had left — in parts swankier and in
parts dirtier than before. Finally, they reached the school and rung in
their history teacher who with great excitement let them in. As
Lootika’s mother had remarked, she looked more haggard than her age and
health would suggest. She did not linger for much of an inquiry, as
would be typical of a such a meeting after so long a time, confirming
their suspicion that she had some specific reason for meeting them other
than catching up with past students. She broke into her story: “I have
something to ask of you all. Kallolini had told me that, if anyone, it
would be one of you all who could help me deal with this. Kallolini’s
elder sister, who apparently knows you Lootika, affirmed the same. My
husband, you may or may not know, was a respected lawyer who practiced
not only at the high court in our city but also in the higher courts. I
really took no interest in his cases or his clients and nor did he
mention any of those at home. Our conversations were on entirely
different matters of common interest. One thing I did know but again did
not take much interest in was his fancy for unsolved cases. He
occasionally played detective and helped people with cases where they
had no recourse through the official channels. He had his connections
from his long practice and could get some of these cases reopened or
receive official attention due to his efforts. He was no busybody but
found great satisfaction in helping people reach closure in incidents
where the system had failed them. I mention this because it might have
some relevance to what happened to him but I don’t know the exact
connection.

It might be about 5 years ago when one evening after an early dinner my
husband remarked that he needed to go out to meet with a client.
Normally, he met his clients on the ground floor of our two-story house
that he used as his office. However, there were some occasions when he
would go out to meet his clients — I guess the discreetness of the
affair required him to do so. In any case, as I mentioned, I never took
a deep interest in the specifics of his cases. Hence, I thought it was
just one of those days and simply asked when he expected to be back. He
said it might take him at least a couple of hours. Four hours passed and
he did not return. I tried calling him, but his phone did not ring. I
became tense and was wondering what I should do. Just then, I heard a
knocking on the door. It was very unusual for anyone to visit us that
late, so I looked through the peephole full of apprehension and saw a
girl who seemed vaguely familiar. Surprised to see a little girl all by
herself knocking at my door at night I wondered if she was being used as
a decoy. Hence, I did not open the door but went up to the balcony
overlooking the door and looked all around. The street was empty, and
her knocking continued at the door. This combined with the vague
foreboding from my husband’s failure to return made me run to the door
and open it. The girl asked me to follow her. I was pretty sure it was
some kind go trap and asked her who she was and what she wanted. She
simply said it was very important and asked me to follow her. I said
would call the police if she did not tell me. She simply said the police
would not be able to help me without her and I could be in trouble if I
went to the police rather than following her. I was surprised that a
little girl would talk that way and shut the door and went inside to
ring the cops. The next thing I knew I was waking up in the morning. I
looked around and was still alone in the house — evidently, I had fallen
into an inexplicable sleep when I tried to contact the police the
previous night. I recalled the events of the night and in sweat called
the police to report that my husband was missing.

The search went on for days and I was repeatedly interviewed by them,
subject to lie-detectors tests and what not but nothing substantial ever
came out of it and the case went cold like one of the cases he might
have liked to look at. In the meantime, the girl kept making her
appearance every now and then at intervals of a month and kept asking me
to follow her. One night something seized me and I followed her and as I
was doing so she tugged me to show the way and I realized it was no real
girl — you may think I have gone cuckoo — but a phantom. Her grip had no
substance at all to it!”

L and S: “Ma’am we understand this is exactly why you wanted to talk to
us. So, no worries. We should not rule out any explanation but tell us
your story as you experienced it. Before you continue could you please
tell us the dates on which the phantom girl arrives?” The history
teacher looked up her phone and gave them the dates. S: “Lootika, they
all seem to be trayodaśī nights. Ma’am was that the day your husband
regrettably vanished?”

H.T: “I do not keep track of the lunar calendar, but I have a strong
feeling that it was not the case. The periodicity set in only after the
second visitation.”  
L: “Pray, continue with your story.”  
H.T: “That day the girl led me to the temple of Hanūmat. I had never
been religious and only rarely visited that temple, but I do know my
husband was quite a devotee. In fact, when I went to the temple with the
girl that night I had a vague recollection of seeing her there in life
on the rare occasions I did go there and giving her the prasāda for I
used to always feel uncomfortable about eating it. In any case, her
phantomhood was confirmed as she vanished at a door just outside the
circumambulatory path around the main deity. Around that time, a strange
change overcame me. I felt drawn to religion and started attending the
expositions of your mothers in the old language at the Śiva temple. The
visitations of the phantom-girl continued, and she kept calling me. I
feared I might be going nuts and wanted to consult a psychiatrist. I
wondered if I should get in touch with your mother, Lootika, to get a
good referral but felt rather embarrassed to do so. By some chance, one
day I saw my old student Kallolini, your younger sister’s classmate, who
had just finished medical school, at the temple. I told her this story.
She was accompanied by her elder sister who mentioned knowing you well,
Lootika. Both of them asked me many medically relevant questions and I
got a referral via her sister. The visit to the shrink was of no
consequence as I was certified as merely having some anxiety and
prescribed some drugs. They made no difference whatsoever and I
discontinued them out of safety concerns. Your friends gave me a
symptom-sheet and asked me to talk to them if I had any of the reported
symptoms. I did not have any other than the persistent melancholy from
the odd turn my life had taken and a sense of dread whenever the phantom
girl came knocking. I mentioned that to them again. They at once looked
at each other and said that I should try to talk to one of you four
sisters or you Somakhya. I asked if I could mention it to your mothers.
They specifically said not to tell that part of my tale to your mothers
but simply ask to meet with one of you when in town.”  
S: “Is there anything more you would like to add to your story?”  
H.T: “Yes. I did follow the phantom girl on two other occasions. The
second time she led me again towards the Hanūmat shrine but instead of
going inside vanished at the cart of the śṛṇgāṭaka vendor who stands at
the street just where the bridge over the river ends. The third occasion
was the most frightening. She led me by the railway station and my legs
were wearying from the long walk. She then turned into a narrow alley
with Pakistani flags fluttering on either side. A cricket match seemed
to be going on and the dwellers were all chanting in unison for the
victory of Pakistan. She then stopped at the break in the wall that
would take you right to the train tracks and beckoned me to enter. I
just could not get myself to proceed any further and turned around to
scoot out of that alley known to be a dangerous place at night and call
a cab. The phantom girl cried out \`there!’ pointing beyond the broken
wall and vanished.”

L: “I commiserate with you. This is rather bizarre ma’am but what
exactly do you want of us?”  
H.T: “What does all this mean? Is my husband dead or alive? Can I have
the ghost girl stop visiting me?”  
L: “We cannot easily answer or solve all of those issues, but we can try
to obtain some information about your husband’s fate. Would you be
prepared to receive it?”  
H.T.: “I’ve resigned myself for the worst. But when the law cannot give
an answer; I still would like an answer. Even if the worst has happened
why would he visit me from beyond in the form of a little girl? Would I
not receive a more understandable signal!”  
L: “OK. Could you please look straight forward and look at your eyebrows
without moving your head and act as though you are seeing through them
to the top of your head. Now close your eyes and open them.” Lootika
noticed that the teacher’s eyeballs seemed to roll inwards.  
S: “Spidery, I guess you can deploy the siddhakāṣṭha effectively.”
Lootika whipped out her siddhakāṣṭha sanctified as per the traditions of
bhairavācāra from her bag and deployed it on her former history teacher:
“Ma’am be calm; you will see some visions and they might give you an
answer. Please note everything you see carefully.” After two minutes in
a trance from the kāṣṭha-prayoga, the teacher returned to her senses
utterly dazed and shocked.  
H.T: “I fear the worst has been confirmed.”  
S: “Please tell us whatever you witnessed, however, painful that might
be. It would bring you some relief at the end.”  
H.T: “I saw that phantom girl being lifted by a man with a beard and
thrown down a manhole-like dark abyss. Then, I saw my husband being
thrown into the same. Then I saw a holy fuckeer mumble some mellifluous
words, I guess in the Urdu and everything goes black. Then I heard a
train passing by.”  
S: “Indeed! I fear the worst is confirmed. You will have to live with
this but the incubus will be lifted in part. Lootika?” Lootika deployed
her siddhakāṣṭha again and their former history teacher awoke from
another short trance in a state of peace.  
L: “We can also perform a bhūtabandha and block that ghost girl from
coming to your house.”  
H.T: “That would be brilliant. I already feel a strange calm within me
for the first time.”  
S: “No Lootika! That might temporarily relieve you ma’am, but it could
be utterly dangerous for Lootika if she tried the bandha and it will not
solve your problem for good. That ghost girl is a positive element. When
you go to the Śivālaya simply offer some ghee or black sesame oil by
drawing this diagram on the riverbank and uttering the following
incantation: yathāsthānaṃ sukhaṃ tiṣṭhatu \|”. Saying so Somakhya wrote
down the incantation and drew the diagram and explained to her how to do
the same. He said the ghost girl will return and you might see her
sitting outside your house periodically, but she might not knock
frequently.”  
L and S: “Now may we kindly take leave. At some point sooner or later we
hope you get a more complete relief and closure.”

Evening had set in and the streets were filling with a great mass of
humanity. The constant blare of horns and their reverberation rent the
polluted air as a throng of officer-goers made their way back home after
a soul-crushing day in the service of some mahāmleccha overlord. Buses,
trucks, cars, rickshaws and motorcycles competed for a sliver of the
road in many a near-collision event. The sides of the streets filled
with diners looking for some tongue-tickling deep-fried delicacy or
sugar-laden treat. The odors wafting from these productions mixed with
the fumes of the vehicles and the products of anaerobic fermentation
from a distant gutter. Those awaiting their culinary orders to arrive
were lost in the virtual worlds beamed on their faces from their phones.
Only subliminally recording these, leaving their former teacher to her
pile of answer sheets, Lootika and Somakhya started walking back home,
each in their own meditation. Lootika broke the silence: “Priyatama, it
strikes me that you are quite convinced that the ghost girl and the
teacher’s husband had some direct connection beyond merely coming to
meet their end in the same pit.” S: “Did you think otherwise?” L: “Truth
to be told, I saw it differently. But now I see your line might explain
somethings. Perhaps, a marūnmatta is the edge connecting the two in
death.” S: “Indeed, that is how I see it. There is a lot more real
detective work needed to fill in the rest of the story and neither of us
is a lokasaṃcārin to get to the bottom of that. There are too many links
for which we lack the right subjects to get a handle. Moreover, a
bhūtabandha by us, in this case, would mean wading into territory that
we don’t fully understand and the unfulfilled bhūta filled with
righteous indignation could turn on you. We should pass this by some of
our lokajña friends — they might be able to throw more light on the
aspects of it belonging to this world. L: “While not performing a
bandha, I think still we should attempt a bhūtanivaha of that ghost-girl
tonight to make her tell us her story.” S: “Not sure we have all the
leads to pull that off successfully…”

Varoli](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/nak%e1%b9%a3atra-darsanam/)
and her family were visiting Vidrum at the rural paradise he had set up.
They had spent the first part of the night stargazing. They would have
gone on but realized that Vidrum and Kalakausha were not really as
excited as they were by the brilliant skies. So, they decided to be a
bit more involved with their hosts and settled down to yarn about the
old days in the pleasant breeze of the southern country. Vidrum: “I
don’t think I ever told you that the mysterious matter of our former
history teacher cleared itself up rather dramatically — you had left the
country by then. However, I wondered if you might have played a role in
that regard.” S and L: “Truth to be told, this is news to us. Please
tell us the story.”

V: “A young female civil servant in the police service was rather
friendly with the suave strongman choṭā Dawood who reigned like a little
shaikh of the large slumland of Kabirwadi near the railway station. But
during a marūnmatta festival, she arrested some chaps for the slaughter
of a camel on the street not knowing that they were Dawood’s buddies.
Dawood issued her a friendly warning for her impudence; unfortunately,
having taken her power to her head she arrogantly retorted that she
would have the strongman spend the rest of his life in jail at a flick
of her finger. Soon thereafter, she disappeared much like our teacher’s
lamented husband. The force, which had no leads despite vigorously
pursuing the death of their commissioned officer, suddenly got an
unexpected tip-off and found her corpse in a deep old railway
maintenance manhole beside the tracks. They also recovered the remains
of two other people long deceased. DNA tests revealed them to be a
well-known city lawyer who had mysteriously vanished, who was none other
than our teacher’s husband, and a girl. It turned out that the girl was
kidnapped while procuring śṛṇgāṭaka-s when returning from school for the
heinous pleasure of choṭā Dawood. She died at the hands of him and his
henchmen and was thrown down there. She was the daughter of the poor
arcaka of the temple of Hanūmat. Just to remind you, Dawood’s man had
also tried to abduct our friend Sharvamanyu’s now-wife Abhirosha in the
days of our youth — but we had fought him off — I’m thankful I had my
grandfather’s billhook with me that day. Our former teacher’s husband
had apparently tried to help the arcaka by trying to get the case to the
police. That evening he had arranged a meeting with the arcaka to help
him make a complaint with the material he had uncovered. However, that
was not to be for Dawood and his men intercepted our teacher’s husband
and dumped him in the same place. The reports mentioned that he feared
their ghosts and had the well-known fuckeer Ata mulq Alla al-Din
cirāg-vālā bābājī to help him ward them off. For some reason the bābā
himself claimed to be possessed by the girl’s ghost and spilt the beans
— his tip-off led the māmu-s to his client’s victims.”

Somakhya: “Ah. Pretty Lootika might have indeed had a hand in that last
part about the fuckeer spilling the beans. She tried to draw that
ghost-girl to make her speak but someone was blocking that phantom from
speaking. So, she broke the block with her prayoga and instigated the
phantom against the blocker.”

**![squares_bhAskara_Fig1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/squares_bhaskara_fig1.png)Figure
1**. Sum and difference of squares amounting to near squares.

In course of our exploration of the bhūjā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya in our early
youth we had observed that there are examples of “near misses”:
![8^2+9^2=12^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8%5E2%2B9%5E2%3D12%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, we were excited to encounter them a little later in an
interesting couple of indeterminate simultaneous equations in the
Līlāvatī. Exhibiting his prowess as both a kavi and a mathematician, the
great Bhāskara-II furnishes the following Vasantatilakā verse in his
Līlāvatī:

rāśyor yayoḥ kṛti-viyogayutī nireke  
mūlaprade pravada tau mama mitra yatra \|  
kliśyanti bījagaṇite paṭavo’pi mūḍhāḥ  
ṣoḍhokta-gūḍhagaṇitaṃ paribhāvayantaḥ \|\| L 62\|\|

Tell me, O friend! those 2 \[numbers\], the sum and difference of whose
squares  
reduced by one result in square numbers, wherein even experts in algebra
who  
keep dwelling upon the mysterious mathematical techniques  
stated in six ways, come up as dim-witted \[in solving this problem\].

-Translation adapted from that conveyed by paṇḍita Ṛāmasubrahmaṇyan, a
learned historian of Hindu mathematics

In terms of his kavitvam, Bhāskara-II abundantly illustrates the use of
figures of speech, such as the yamaka-s or alliterative duplications.
Ṛāmasubrahmaṇyan also mentions that he uses the figure of speech termed
the “ullāsa” via the opposition of “paṭavaḥ” and “mūḍhāḥ” in the same
verse to bring out the wonder associated with this problem, i.e. it is
difficult even for those who are adept at the 6 operations of
traditional Hindu mathematics: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, squaring and square-root-extraction. The problem, put in
modern notation goes thus:

Let ![x, y, a,
b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+a%2C+b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be rational numbers with
![y>x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then,

![x^2+y^2-1=a^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2By%5E2-1%3Da%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y^2-x^2-1
=b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2-x%5E2-1+%3Db%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

When we first encountered it, we wondered if it was really that
difficult but soon our investigation showed that it was hardly simple
for us. To date, we do not have a general solution in integers, placing
us squarely among the dull-witted. However, in the course of our study
of the integer solutions, we discovered parametrizations with
interesting connections beyond those provided by Bhāskara. We suspect he
was aware of one or more of these, which is why he termed it a difficult
problem for even those well-versed in arithmetic operations. In essence,
the problem the generation of 2 new squares plus a unit square for each
of them from the sums and differences of the areas of 2 starting squares
(Figure 1). Before we consider the integer solutions, let us see the
parametrizations offered by Bhāskara to obtain rational fractional
solutions. By way of providing several numerical examples (a white
indologist of the German school but with a style more typical of the
American school had once stated with much verbiage what essentially
amounts to “Hindoos must be idiots” for presenting such repetitive
examples. He evidently forgot the fact that it was also the style of the
great Leonhard Euler), he says:

\|\| (Parametrization 2)

The second parametrization he offers is rather simple:

![x=1;
y=\\dfrac{2t^2+1}{2t}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%3B+y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2t%5E2%2B1%7D%7B2t%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

He illustrates it with the integers ![t=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![t=
\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With integers, we see that
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is defined by a fractional sequence whose denominators are the
successive even numbers and whose numerators are defined by the sequence
![2n^2+1: 3, 9, 19, 33,
51...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n%5E2%2B1%3A+3%2C+9%2C+19%2C+33%2C+51...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This sequence has interesting geometric connections. One can see that it
defines the maximum number of bounded or unbounded regions that a plane
can be divided into by
![t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pairs of parallel lines. Thus, one can see that the
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of Bhāskara’s second parametrization provides the ratio the maximum
partitions of a plane to the total number of parallel lines drawn in
dyads used for the purpose.

2.** Division of plane into regions by parallel lines: 3, 9, 19… regions
by 1, 2, 3 pairs of parallel lines.

Bhāskara’s first fractional parametrization takes the form:

![x=\\dfrac{8t^2-1}{2t}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Cdfrac%7B8t%5E2-1%7D%7B2t%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![y= \\dfrac{x^2}{2}+1 =
\\dfrac{64t^4-8t^2+1}{8t^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%2B1+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B64t%5E4-8t%5E2%2B1%7D%7B8t%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

He illustrates this with ![t= \\tfrac{1}{2}, 1,
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%2C+1%2C+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which respectively yield the pairs of solutions ![(1,
\\tfrac{3}{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![(\\tfrac{7}{2},
\\tfrac{57}{8})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctfrac%7B7%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B57%7D%7B8%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![(\\tfrac{31}{4},
\\tfrac{993}{32})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctfrac%7B31%7D%7B4%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B993%7D%7B32%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The problem can also be seen as that of finding the intersection between
coaxial circles and hyperbolas. Restricting ourselves to intersections
in the first quadrant, we can see that the general form of the solutions
would be:

![x=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^2-b^2}{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5E2-b%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![y=\\sqrt{1 +
\\dfrac{a^2+b^2}{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Csqrt%7B1+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5E2%2Bb%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From the above, for integer solutions we can say the following: 1) Given
that
![a^2+b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bb%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
must be an even number, ![a,
b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
should be even. 2) Hence, from the original pair of equations, we can
say that ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
must be of opposite parity with
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being even and
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
odd. 3) Further, for
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be an even number it has to be divisible by 8. 4) Hence, ![y \\mod 8
\\equiv
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cmod+8+%5Cequiv+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Therefore, all solutions should be of the form ![x=8m,
y=8n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D8m%2C+y%3D8n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![m,
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2C+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are integers. Beyond this, not being particularly adept at mathematics,
to actually solve the equations for integers, we took the numerical
approach and computed the first few pairs of solutions. It was quite
easy to locate the first solution ![(8,
9)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%288%2C+9%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1) which in a sense is like the most primitive bhujā-koṭi-karṇa
triplet (3, 4, 5). The first few solutions are provided below as a table
and illustrated as a
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plot in Figure 3.

**[![Bhaskara_squares](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/bhaskara_squares.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/bhaskara_squares.png)Figure
3.** First few integer solutions.

**Table 1**

![squares_bhAskara_Table1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/squares_bhaskara_table1.png)

We quickly noticed that there is one family of solutions that lie on a
clearly defined curve (dark red in Figure 3).

**Family 1.** This family has the convergents: ![\\tfrac{y}{x}
\\rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bx%7D+%5Crightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
1, 2, 3, 4
![\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can easily obtain parametrization defining this family to be:  
![x=8t^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D8t%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y=8t^4+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D8t%5E4%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This yields (8,9); (64,129); (216,649); (512,2049); (1000,5001);
(1728,10369); (2744,19209); (4096,32769); (5832,52489); (8000,80001).
This corresponds to the the third parametrization offered by Bhāskara
that may be used to obtain rational fractional or integer solutions:

athavā sūtram –  
iṣṭasya varga-vargo ghanaś ca tav aṣṭa-saṅguṇau prathamaḥ \|  
saiko rāśī syātām evam vyakte+ atha vā avyakte \|\| L 63  
Or the sūtra: Square the square of the given number and the cube of that
number respectively multiplied by 8, adding 1 to the first product, the
solutions are obtained both for arithmetic examples or as algebraic
parametrization.

By taking
![\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the given, the square of the square of the given number is
![\\tfrac{1}{16}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B16%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which multiplied by 8 is
![\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This plus 1 yields the first number of the solution
![\\tfrac{3}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Again given
![\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
its cube is
![\\tfrac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which multiplied by 8 yields the second number of the solution, 1. Thus,
we have the pair (1, 3/2). Now with 1 as the given we get (8, 9); with 2
we get (64, 129); with 3 we get (216, 649). Thus, with each of these
parametrizations (i.e. all the 3 he offers) by substituting any number
one gets infinite solutions.

However, this parametrization hardly accounts for all the solutions.
Through analysis of the remaining solutions, we could discover several
further families with distinct more complex parametrizations. They
are:  
**Family 2.** This family has the convergent ![\\tfrac{y}{x}
\\rightarrow
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bx%7D+%5Crightarrow+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![x=
(T_t(3))^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+%28T_t%283%29%29%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y=(T_t(3))^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%28T_t%283%29%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here,
![T_t(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_t%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the
![t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-th
Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind that is defined based on the
multiple angle formula of the cosine function:  
![\\cos(x)
=\\cos(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%28x%29+%3D%5Ccos%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^2(x)-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%282x%29%3D2%5Ccos%5E2%28x%29-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![\\cos(3x)= 4\\cos^3(x)-3
\\cos(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%283x%29%3D+4%5Ccos%5E3%28x%29-3+%5Ccos%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, we get the Chebshev polynomials
![T_n(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:  
![T_1(x)=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_1%28x%29%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![T_2(x)=
2x^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_2%28x%29%3D+2x%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![T_3(x) = 4x^3-3x
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_3%28x%29+%3D+4x%5E3-3x+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we get the pairs (8,9); (288,289); (9800, 9801); (332928, 332929).
All these points lie on the line
![y=x+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One observes that
![\\tfrac{x}{2}=k^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7B2%7D%3Dk%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where ![k
\\rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Crightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
2, 12, 70, 408
![\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From the above, it is easy to prove that the sequence of fractions
![\\tfrac{\\sqrt{y}}{k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7By%7D%7D%7Bk%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are successive convergents for
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For
![t=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![\\tfrac{577}{408 } = 1.41421
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B577%7D%7B408+%7D+%3D+1.41421+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is Baudhāyana’s convergent approximating
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to 5 places after the decimal point.

**Family 3.** This family has the convergent ![\\tfrac{y}{x}
\\rightarrow
\\tfrac{4}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bx%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Ctfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(green line in Figure 3). It can be parametrized thus:

![x=8 \\left \\lceil \\dfrac{(9 - 3 \\sqrt{7}) (8 + 3 \\sqrt{7})^t}{28}
\\right
\\rceil](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D8+%5Cleft+%5Clceil+%5Cdfrac%7B%289+-+3+%5Csqrt%7B7%7D%29+%288+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B7%7D%29%5Et%7D%7B28%7D+%5Cright+%5Crceil&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the ratio of successive
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converges to ![8 + 3
\\sqrt{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
a number which is again related to Chebyshev polynomials of the first
kind evaluated at 8:

![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}\\dfrac{T_n(8)}{T\_{n-1}(8)} = 8
+ 3
\\sqrt{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D%5Cdfrac%7BT_n%288%29%7D%7BT_%7Bn-1%7D%288%29%7D+%3D+8+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![y=\\left \\lfloor \\dfrac{32}{3} \\left \\lceil \\dfrac{(9 - 3

Thus, we arrive at the pairs constituting this family as: (8,9);
(80,105); (1232,1641); (19592,26121)
![\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

**Family 4.** This family has the convergent ![\\tfrac{y}{x}
\\rightarrow \\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx
1.1180339](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bx%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+1.1180339&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It can be parametrized thus:  
![x=
M(6t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+M%286t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is every 6th term of the mātra-meru sequence ![M(n): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,

Thus, we can also express
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using the Golden ratio ![\\phi \\approx 1.61803

![x=

Thus, the ratio of successive
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converges to
![\\phi^6=9+\\sqrt{80}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%5E6%3D9%2B%5Csqrt%7B80%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
we can also write
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using the hyperbolic sine function:

![x= \\dfrac{2
\\sinh(6t\\log(\\phi))}{2\\phi-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B2+%5Csinh%286t%5Clog%28%5Cphi%29%29%7D%7B2%5Cphi-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Similarly, we get:

![y=\\dfrac{\\phi^{6t}+\\phi^{-6t}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cphi%5E%7B6t%7D%2B%5Cphi%5E%7B-6t%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

As with
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can also get a hyperbolic trignometric expression for
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):  
![y= \\cosh(6t
\\log(\\phi))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Ccosh%286t+%5Clog%28%5Cphi%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Finally, we can also write
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
compactly in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind:

Thus, the first few members of this family are: (8,9); (144,161);
(2584,2889); (46368,51841)

Thus, we see that the convergents with odd numerators and even
denominators yield the
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

term of family 1; hence, it may be seen as branching from family 1. In
practical terms, one can obtain these values using the below 2-seeded

In the case of families 4, 5 and 6, we observe that the sum and the
difference of the squares of the numerators and denominators yield
perfect squares. Further, the denominator is always an even number and
the numerator a surd of the form
![\\sqrt{k^2+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

In families 7, 8 there are no small terms that connect them to any of
the other families; keeping with Hindu love for big numbers, they start
relatively large and grow rapidly. These 8 families cover all the
solutions in Table 1 and Figure 3 ![(\\le

Is there a general way to obtain all parametrizations for the integer
solutions of this pair of indeterminate equations? Perhaps this has
already been answered by mathematicians or perhaps not. In any case, as
Bhāskara had stated, the solutions to this couple of equations is not an
entirely trivial problem and sufficiently absorbing for an enthusiast of
arithmetic.

The coronavirus that made its way to humans aided by the Cīna-s at Wuhan
has now been with us for nearly an year. Right from the early days of
this outbreak, one thing has been notable about this virus: some people
got very ill from it, while others breezed through a relatively mild or
supposedly “asymptomatic” infection (though we still do not know the
long term consequences of the mild infection). This made the disease way
more deadly than its cousin SARS as potentially infectious individuals
with the mild form of the disease could wander about spreading it. As a
result, at the time of writing, at least 1,085,000 people have died from
it the world over, and anywhere between 40-300 million could have been
infected by it. Some factors affecting the differential outcome were
clear even when the virus was still only with Cīna-s: it affected older
people and men more severely. In the early days of the pandemic, several
other factors were also proposed to affect the outcome of the disease,
like temperature extremes, humidity, prior vaccination with BCG.
However, these, especially the environmental ones, have not been
supported by the data coming from the explosive pandemic that followed.
It was also clear that there were going to be genetic factors that
influence the outcome. These are becoming clearer only now and are the
topic of this note. This note is based on data from several recent
studies that have tried to identify genetic risk factors in various
populations. What we do here is to briefly look at the genes that have
been identified and give some commentary on them and what can be
inferred from them.

The first set of studies by Bastard (yes, that is the author’s name;
not an easy one to bear in the English-speaking world) and Zhang et al
took a directed approach to look at 13 genes in the Toll-like receptor-3
(TLR3)- type-I interferon system. Mutations in these genes have
previously been implicated in severe influenza with involvement of the
lower respiratory tract and other viral diseases. They found that
potential loss-of-function variants in these genes were enriched in
patients with a severe outcome of the Wuhan disease. In a related study
they found, that an autoimmune condition with antibodies against the
type-I interferons also correlated with a similar outcome as the
potential loss-of-function mutations. This supported the idea that
defects in the interferon-I (IFN) system are a predictor of disease
outcome even in the case of the current coronavirus. This is rather
interesting as the bats show distinct alternations to their IFN-I system
relative to other mammals. First, black flying foxes have been shown to
have a higher and potentially constitutive expression of IFN-I genes.
Second, the Egyptian fruit bats show and expansion of the IFN-I genes,
especially the subtype IFNW (interferon
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
These observations, together with the fact that bats have a high level
of tolerance to SARS-like CoVs (and other viruses) support the idea that
the type-I IFN system is important in surviving not just SARS-CoV-2 but
also other viruses.

As a simple caricature, the following pathway describes the role of
products of the 13 genes in the IFN-I system in cells infected by a
virus (say the respiratory epithelial cells) or specialized blood cells,
which are part of the immune system, that sense the virus (plasmacytoid
dendritic cells):

1\. Recognition of the invading virus by the leucine-rich repeats of the
TLR3 protein triggers a signaling response that additionally involves
TRIF, UNC93B1, TRAF3, TBK1 and NEMO proteins which ultimately results in
activating of a transcription factor IRF3 in the nucleus.  
2. Consequently, IRF3 induces the transcription of IFN-Is, which is
further amplified by a related transcription factor IRF7 which is
induced by IRF3.  
3. The secretion of INF-Is is followed by their binding of receptors on
other cells like epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. The
receptors are dimers of the two paralogous proteins IFNRA1 and IFNRA1.  
4. The receptors activate the associated transcription factors STAT1 and
STAT2, which then associates with another transcription factor IRF9 (a
paralog of IRF3 and IRF7) to activate the interferon-stimulated genes
that mediate the immune response to the virus.

This is the well-known INF-I immune response. Of these proteins, the
TLR3 and TRIF/TICAM1 are proteins with TIR domains, which we had earlier
shown to have very ancient roots in the immune response of bacteria
against the viruses that infect them. UNC93B1 is a membrane protein
involved in the trafficking of the TLR3 protein from the endoplasmic
reticulum to endolysosome where it can intercept the endocytosed virus.
TLR3 additionally has the receptor portion in the form of leucine-rich
repeats that recognize the invasive virus. TRIF has an
![\\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-helical
tetratricopeptide repeats that keep its TIR domain inactive till TLR3 is
activated. At that point, it associates with TLR3’s TIR domain. TRIF
also has an RHIM motif, a short sequence that allows the protein to form
homotypic oligomers which are important for the downstream signaling.
Thus, it serves as a platform for initiating a signal with the cell in
response to the sensing of the virus by TLR3. The signal is set off
first by TRAF3 which is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase that is recruited to the
platform formed by TRIF. It consequently conjugates Lysine-63 ubiquitins
to its targets. This signal is transmitted further via the kinase TBK1,
which associates with NEMO to form a signaling-kinase complex similar to
the kinase complex that activates the inflammatory transcription factor
NF![\\kappa](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)B
by phosphorylating its inhibitor IKK. TBK1 in addition to its kinase
domain has a Ubiquitin-like domain that we had discovered a while back.
The presence of a ubiquitin-like domain in TBK1 allows it to associate
with the ubiquitins conjugated by TRAF3. As a consequence of this
interaction via its ubiquitin-like domain, it becomes functionally
active to phosphorylate the DNA-binding transcription factor IRF3. This
then dimerizes to activate the transcription of the interferon genes.
This response to the virus can be triggered in different ways but this
is the typical mechanism for the RNA viruses like influenza or DNA
viruses like Herpes simplex virus. Thus, mutations in this system have
previously shown to impair the response to influenza resulting in severe
pneumonia or HSV resulting in encephalitis.

The second part of this response is signal transduced by the IFN-I via
its receptor. This is via the famous JAK-STAT pathway that involves the
kinases JAK which phosphorylate the STATs. These and their partner IRF9,
all DNA-binding transcription factors, induce the IFN-I stimulated
genes, many of which are the “sword-arm” of the antiviral defense. Thus,
mutations in the two IFNAR genes, IRF9 and STATs also result in negative
outcomes from viral infections and adverse reactions to live measles and
Yellow fever vaccines. However, interestingly, a mutation in the IFNAR1
gene resulting in an impaired receptor that binds the type-I IFN, IFNB,
weakly results in greater resistance to tuberculosis. This is rather
striking as, unlike with the viral diseases, it selects in the opposite
direction for the strength of IFN-I signaling. The complexity of this
situation even with SARS-CoV-2 is suggested by reports that the
localized hyper-expression of type-I and III IFNs in the lung results in
a more severe disease poor lung-repair. However, in contrast, reduced
IFN-I production by peripheral blood immunocytes is associated with a
severe form of the disease. Thus, over the IFN-I is important for the
defense against SARS-CoV-2 but the location of over-expression seems to
matter.

A notable point is that while both the life-threatening and benign forms
of the disease are fairly uniformly distributed across populations with
diverse ancestries, these IFN-I related loss-of-function variants
reported by the authors are primarily found in Europeans, with some
presence in diverse Asian populations (Figure 1). While the numbers are
small, it is still significant that they did not get any of these
variants in Africans. This is striking given that, another study found
that in the USA infection and death rates are 2 to 3 times higher in
people of African ancestry than their proportion of the population.
This, suggests that in Africa there has possibly been selection against
these variants due to pressure from other viruses which are prevalent
there. Indeed, the related coronavirus MERS might have had its ultimate
origins in Africa even suggesting direct events of selection by
coronaviruses in the past. However, notably, the researchers found that
African ancestry people in the US have significantly higher expression
in the nasal epithelium of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)
which along with the other protease ACE2 is a receptor used by
SARS-CoV-2 to invade target cells.

Also related to the above complex of 13 genes, was a small study by van
der Made et al based on exome sequencing that identified rare
loss-of-function mutations in TLR7 in 4 young men with severe disease.
This resulted in defective type-I and type-II interferon production.
While a small study, it is notable that it recovered these mutations in
TLR7. This gene is in a cluster with its paralog TLR8 on the
X-chromosome; hence, males have only one copy. Importantly, both of
them, like TLR3 are sensors the detect viruses which enter cells via
endocytosis. It specifically senses single-stranded RNA fragments that
are enriched in guanine and uracil in the endosome of plasmacytoid
dendritic cells and B cells, raising the possibility that impairment of
these virus-specific TLRs might be part of the increased susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 of males.

1. The mapping of different forms of the disease on to the 1000 genomes
populations modified from Zhang and Bastard et al. LOF are the
loss-of-function variants they identified.

The next study by Zeberg and Pääbo discovered a genomic segment of
![\\sim
50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim+50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
kb that confers an elevated risk of severe disease which is inherited
from Neanderthals. This region on chromosome 3 kept coming up repeatedly
in multiple investigations for genetic determinants of disease severity.
This core region of 49.4 Kb and the larger surrounding region of \~333.8
Kb shows strong linkage disequilibrium and appears to have introgressed
from a Neanderthal \~60-40 Kya. This region is rather interesting
because it encodes 5 chemokine receptor genes, namely XCR1, CXCR6, CCR9,
CCR1 and CCR3. These are all receptors for the signaling proteins known
as chemokines, which transmit various immune signals such as in the
recruitment of effector immunocytes to the site of inflammation (e.g.
various lineages of cytotoxic cells and antibody-producing B-cells) or
in directing T-cells to guard different parts of the lungs.
Gene-knockouts pf CCR1 suggest that it plays a role in protecting
against inflammation and increases susceptibility to fatal infection of
the central nervous system by the coronavirus MHV1 in mice. Reducing
signaling via this receptor has also been shown to increase
susceptibility to the herpes simplex virus type 2. Some chemokine
receptors are used by viruses and other pathogens to enter the
vertebrate cells. For example, CCR3 and CXCR6 from this locus code for
the co-receptor for the AIDS virus HIV-1 and/or SIV. The human
herpesvirus 8 encodes its own chemokine vMIP-II, which targets the
protein XCR1 encoded by this locus and blocks signaling via it. Thus,
the chemokine receptors are a central part of the immune response of
jawed vertebrates and under strong selection from the host-pathogen arms
race.

What is most striking about this region is that it is elevated in
frequency in the Indian subcontinent (\~50%; It is found in \~16% of
Europeans) while absent or rare in East Asia. Indeed, after the mating
with Neanderthals, the introgressed regions from them have been
routinely purged off the genome of *Homo sapiens* suggesting a degree of
incompatibility with the sapiens alleles. This is consistent with the
association of Neanderthal alleles with certain immune dysfunctions.
However, this region has followed the converse pattern. If it has been
retained after coming from a Neanderthal ancestor and elevated in
frequencies it must be due to selection for it in the subcontinent
likely due to some relatively recent or extant pathogen. The region has
been previously noted as being under selection in East Bengal. This
raises the possibility that it could have conferred an advantage to
diseases such as cholera. However, it is rather notable that despite
gene flow between and geographic proximity it is so rare in East Asia.
[We and
others](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/05/17/pandemic-days-4-viruses-get-new-hosts/)
have long held that several extant CoV diseases (today relatively mild)
have originated in East Asia, likely China, potentially as a side effect
of their culinary habits. This would imply that there was strong
selection from these CoVs against this Neanderthal-derived variant in
East Asia when those CoVs were still severe, even as it was selected for
in India by other pathogens. Thus, it is a classic evolutionary
phenomenon of bidirectional selection in action. Such selection events
often leave their mark in immune molecules driving them in different
directions. The Duffy Chemokine receptor by which the *Plasmodium vivax*
and *P. knowlesi* malarial parasites enter cells is likely to be another
such. Loss or reduced expression of the Duffy receptor favors resistance
to vivax malaria. But the protein is retained widely in humans
suggesting some immune function.

2. Distribution of Neanderthal variant across populations from Zeberg
and Pääbo .

Finally, another set of genome-wide association studies by Ellinghaus et
al and Roberts et al identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) associated with a severe form of the disease. One of these in
chromosome 3 corresponds to the same region as identified by the above
study as coming from the Neanderthals. Another SNP was identified on
chromosome 9 which is in the vicinity of the ABO gene that determines
the ABO blood type. The ABO blood group is determined by the
oligosaccharide synthesized by 4 glycosyltransferases: the two closely
linked paralogs FUT1 and FUT2 make the base oligosaccharide by adding a
fucose. This is modified further by the products of the ABO gene, the
A-variant glycosyltransferase which adds an
![\\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
1-3-N-acetylgalactosamine and the B-variant glycosyltransferase which
adds a 1-3-galactose. This oligosaccharide is the conjugated to lipid
head-groups and proteins (as on the RBC surface) to give rise to the
A/B/AB antigen. If this gene is dysfunctional, it results in O where
neither sugar is added. These sugars are believed to play a role in
cell-cell adhesion. The polymorphism in ABO across humans suggests that
it has been under some kind of immune selection. Indeed, there have been
studies claiming an association of this gene with susceptibility to
various bacterial and viral infections (noroviruses and rotaviruses).
Interestingly, a knockdown of the ABO gene has been reported to inhibit
HIV-1 replication in HeLa P4/R5 cells. This could be because of multiple
reasons: 1. pathogens specifically binding cells with glycoproteins
decorated by particular versions of the sugar. 2. Viruses themselves
possess various glycoproteins against which antibodies develop. These
could cross-react with the host glycoproteins exerting selection via
autoimmunity. Alternatively, the absence of a certain modification on
the host protein could help the host to develop better neutralizing
antibodies against certain viral glycoproteins. It has been suggested
that the influenza viral glycoproteins and ABO locus might be in some
such evolutionary interaction. 3. Immunocytes localize to specific parts
of the body by recognizing the sugars on surface proteins and lipids.
These might play a role in response to pathogens. Indeed, other than the
ABO (H included) blood group, other blood group systems are also based
on polymorphisms of glycosyltransferases (PIPK, Lewis, I, Globoside,
FORS, Sid) or extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases (Dombrock)
suggesting that such evolutionary entanglements between pathogens and
cell-surface modifications might be more widespread. However, the role
of ABO in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, even if plausible, remains
unclear.

The Roberts et al study also identified a SNP on chromosome 22 possibly
associated with the
![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-immunoglobulin
locus that codes for the antibody light chains. This is again consistent
with a defect in antibody production by B-cells. Another SNP identified
by them lies on chromosome 1 in the vicinity of the IVNS1ABP gene. The
SWT1 gene also lies some distance away from the former gene.
Interestingly, IVNS1ABP has been shown to interact with the influenza
virus NS1 protein. This NS1-IVNS1ABP complex targets the mRNA of
another influenza gene M1 to nuclear speckles enriched in splicing
factors for alternative splicing. The result is an alternatively spliced
mRNA M2 that codes for a proton channel needed for acidification and
release of viral ribonucleoproteins in the endosome during invasion.
Interestingly, IVNS1ABP belongs to large class POZ domain proteins with
central HEAT and C-terminal Kelch repeats that also function as
cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligases, several of which have antiviral roles.
Hence, it showing up in the context of SARS-CoV-2 is rather interesting
as it raises multiple possibilities: 1. Is it involved in the
trafficking of viral mRNA as in influenza? 2. Is it an intracellular
antiviral factor that recruits an E3 ligase complex for tagging viral
proteins for destructions?

It is also possible that this SNP affects the nearby SWT1 gene. Sometime
back we had shown that this protein contains 2 endoRNase domains. It
prevents the cytoplasmic leakage of defective unspliced mRNAs by
cleaving such RNAs at the nuclear pore. It is hence possible that this
protein also interacts with viral RNA in someway. In either case, it is
notable that this SNP is associated with disease severity only in males
and not females. The cause for this again remains a mystery. Finally,
this screen recovered a SNP on chromosome 1 close to the SRRM1 whose
product is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This again raises the
possibility of interaction with viral RNA.

In conclusion, the risk factors have pointed in many different
directions, some relatively well understood from susceptibility to other
viruses and yet others which remain murky. Evidently, there will be more
rare ones which remain to be uncovered. However, even with the current
examples, there are hints of bidirectional selection at multiple loci
suggesting that sweeps of dominant pathogens have optimized our immune
systems in different directions. The victory against one could leave one
susceptible to another.

Figure 1. Pyramidal numbers

The following note provides some exceedingly elementary mathematics,
primarily for bālabodhana. Sometime back we heard a talk by a famous
contemporary mathematician (M. Bhargava) in which he described how as a
kid he discovered for himself the formula for pyramidal numbers (i.e.
defined by the number of spheres packed in pyramids with a square base;
Figure 1). It reminded us of a parallel experience in our childhood, and
also of the difference between an ordinary person and a mathematician.
In those long past days, we found ourselves in the company of a clansman
who had a much lower sense of purpose than us in our youth (it seems to
have inverted in adulthood). Hence, he kept himself busy by leafing
through books of “puzzles” or playing video games. He showed us one such
“puzzle” which was puzzling him. It showed something like Figure 1 and
asked the reader to find the total number of balls in the pile if a
base-edge had 15 balls. We asked him why that was a big deal — after
all, it was just a lot of squaring and addition and suggested that we
get started with a paper and pencil. He responded that he too had
realized the same but had divined that what the questioner wanted was a
formula into which we could plug in a base-edge with any number of balls
and get the answer. We tried to figure out that formula but failed;
thus, we sorted with the mere mortals rather than the great
intellectuals.

Nevertheless, our effort was not entirely a waste. In the process of
attempting to crack the formula, we discovered for ourselves an
isomorphism: The count of the balls in the pyramid is the same as the
total number of squares that can be counted in a ![n\\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
square grid (Figure 2). In this mapping, the single ball on the top is
equivalent to the biggest or the bounding square. The base layer of the
pyramid corresponds to the individual squares of the grid. All other
layers map onto interstitial squares — in Figure 2 we show how those are
defined by pink shading and cross-hatching of one example of them. In
this mapping, the entire pyramid is mapped into the interior of the
apical ball, which is now represented as a sphere. Thus, the number of
balls packed into a pyramid and the number of squares in a ![n\\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
square grid are merely 3D and 2D representations of the same number,
i.e. the sum of squares
![1^2+2^2+3^2...n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5E2%2B2%5E2%2B3%5E2...n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

2. The total number of squares formed by contact in a square grid.

We got our answer to this a couple of years later when we started
reading the Āryabhaṭīyam of Āryabhaṭa, one of the greatest Hindu
scientists of all times. He says:

saika-sa-gaccha-padānām kramāt-tri-saṃvargitasya ṣaṣṭho .aṃśaḥ \|  
varga-citi-ghanaḥ sa bhavet citi-vargo ghana-citi-ghanaś ca \|\| AB 2.22

The sixth part of the product of the three quantities, viz. the number
of terms, the number of terms plus one, and twice the number of terms
plus one is the sum of the squares. The square of the sum of the
(original) series is the sum of the cubes. \[vide KS Shukla\].

In modern language, we would render the first formula, which concerns
us, as:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^{n} j^2 =
\\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+j%5E2+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is the formula for the figurate numbers known as the pyramidal
numbers as they define square pyramids (Figure 1). A pratyakṣa geometric
proof for this offered by the great Gārgya Nīlakaṇṭha somayājin (Figure
3). While this proof appears in Nīlakaṇṭha’s bhāṣya on the Āryabhaṭīyam,
it is likely that some such proof was already known to Āryabhaṭa.

For bālabodhana:

1\) He first asks you to lay a rectangular floor of
![(2n+1)(n+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282n%2B1%29%28n%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cubic units.

2\) Then you erect the walls on 3 of sides of the floor of height
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cubic units, namely the 2 sides of length
![n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and 1 side of length
![2n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

3\) The shell thus constructed has:

![(2n+1)(n+1)=2n^2+3n+1
\\rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282n%2B1%29%28n%2B1%29%3D2n%5E2%2B3n%2B1+%5Crightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
floor

![(2n+1)n-(2n+1)=2n^2-n-1
\\rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282n%2B1%29n-%282n%2B1%29%3D2n%5E2-n-1+%5Crightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
backwall

![2(n^2-n)=2n^2-2n
\\rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%28n%5E2-n%29%3D2n%5E2-2n+%5Crightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
sidewalls

i.e. a total of
![6n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cubic units or bricks.

From the figure, it is apparent that the shell can accommodate another
shell based on
![(n-1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n-1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which in turn can accommodate one based on
![(n-2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n-2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
units and so on till 1. Thus, we can fill a cuboid of volume,

![\\displaystyle n(n+1)(2n+1)= 6\\sum\_{j=1}^{n}
j^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+n%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%3D+6%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+j%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

This yields Āryabhaṭa’s formula from which we can write the sequence of
pyramidal numbers
![Py_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Py_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:

**1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240…**

We had earlier seen Āryabhaṭa and Nīlakaṇṭha’s work on triangular
numbers (sum of integers) and tetrahedral numbers (the sum of the sum of
integers) \[[footnote
1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/triangles-hexes-and-cubes/)\].
From that, we know the formula for tetrahedral numbers to be:

![Te_n=\\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Te_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%28n%2B2%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

**1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, 286, 364, 455, 560, 680…**

We see that
![Py_n=Te_n+Te\_{n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Py_n%3DTe_n%2BTe_%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This can be easily proven by seeing that merging two successive
tetrahedral piles of spheres we get a square pyramid pile of balls (see
figure in \[[footnote
1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/triangles-hexes-and-cubes/)\]).
Shortly thereafter, this led us to finding for ourselves the space
occupancy or density constant for atomic packing. Consider uniformly
sized spherical atoms to be packed in a pyramid, like in Figure 1. Then
the question is what fraction of the volume of the pyramid will be
occupied by matter. We know that the volume of the pyramid whose side
length is
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is ![V =
\\tfrac{l^2a}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bl%5E2a%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is its height. From the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya we have its height as
![\\tfrac{l}{\\sqrt{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bl%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence,

![V =
\\tfrac{l^3}{3\\sqrt{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bl%5E3%7D%7B3%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now the volume occupied by the atoms from Āryabhaṭa’s series sum is:

![V_a=\\dfrac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6}\\cdot \\dfrac{4\\pi
r^3}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_a%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2n%5E3%2B3n%5E2%2Bn%7D%7B6%7D%5Ccdot+%5Cdfrac%7B4%5Cpi+r%5E3%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The radius of each atom is
![r=\\tfrac{l}{2n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bl%7D%7B2n%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Plugging this in the above we get:

![V_a=\\dfrac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6}\\cdot \\dfrac{4\\pi
l^3}{24n^3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_a%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2n%5E3%2B3n%5E2%2Bn%7D%7B6%7D%5Ccdot+%5Cdfrac%7B4%5Cpi+l%5E3%7D%7B24n%5E3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Simplifying we get:

![V_a = \\left( \\dfrac{1}{18}+
\\dfrac{1}{12n}+\\dfrac{1}{36n^2}\\right)\\pi
l^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_a+%3D+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B18%7D%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B12n%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B36n%5E2%7D%5Cright%29%5Cpi+l%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Since the atoms have infinitesimal radius we can take the limit ![n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and we are left with:

![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty} V_a =\\dfrac{\\pi
l^3}{18}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+V_a+%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi+l%5E3%7D%7B18%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we get,

![\\dfrac{V_a}{V}=\\dfrac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\approx
0.7404805](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7BV_a%7D%7BV%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D+%5Capprox+0.7404805&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence, little under
![\\tfrac{3}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the space occupied by solid matter is filled by uniform spherical
atoms. This meditation on atomic packing led us to another way of
counting squares. Imagine circles packed as in Figure 4. The circles can
then be used to define squares. The most obvious set of squares is
equivalent to the ![n \\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grid that we considered above. Here the smallest squares of the grid are
equivalent to those circumscribing each circle, or alternative inscribed
within it as shown in the example with just 1 circle. We can also join
the centers of the circles and get bigger squares. If we instead
circumscribe the circles we get an equivalent number corresponding to
the bounding and interstitial squares of the ![n \\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grid. However, we notice (as shown in the ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
example) that we can also get additional squares by joining the centers
cross-ways. So the question was what is the total number of squares if
we count in this manner?

[![pyrFig4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/pyrfig4.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/pyrfig4.png)Figure
4. Squares defined by packed circles.

We noticed that the first two cases will have the same number of squares
as the pyramidal number case. However, from the ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
case onward we will get additional squares. We noticed that for ![3
\\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get one additional square beyond the pyramidal numbers; for the ![4
\\times
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
case we get 4 additional squares. It can be seen that the number of
additional squares essentially define tetrahedral numbers; thus, we can
write the sequence
![S_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of this mode of counting as below:

![S_1=Py_1,
S_2=Py_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%3DPy_1%2C+S_2%3DPy_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
when ![n\\ge 3,
S_n=Py_n+Te\_{n-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cge+3%2C+S_n%3DPy_n%2BTe_%7Bn-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

![\\therefore S_n=\\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\dfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}=
\\dfrac{n^3+n}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+S_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n-1%29%28n-2%29%7D%7B6%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bn%5E3%2Bn%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![S_n:](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n%3A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
**1, 5, 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, 260, 369, 505, 671, 870, 1105, 1379,
1695…**

We can also derive this sequence in another way. Write the natural
numbers thus:

**(1); (2,3); (4,5,6); (7,8,9,10); (11,12,13,14,15);…**

If we then take the sum of each group in brackets, which has ![1, 2, 3
...
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+2%2C+3+...+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
elements, we get
![S_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

We observe that from the 3rd term onward this sequence remarkably yields
the magic constants
![M](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(row, column and diagonal sums or the largest eigenvalue of the matrix
defined by the magic square) for the minimal magic squares (bhadra-s)
i.e. magic squares made of numbers from
![1:n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%3An%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the order or the side length of it \[[footnote
2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/the-magic-of-the-deva-ogdoad/)\].
We also realized then that this was the basis of the “magic choice”
property which we used in a schoolyard trick. That is illustrated in
Figure 5.

[![pyrFig5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/pyrfig5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/pyrfig5.png)

Figure 5. Magic choice.

Write a ![n \\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
square of all integers from
![1...n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1...n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Ask a person to silently randomly choose
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
numbers such that each row and column of the square is represented once
(orange circles in Figure 5) and sum them up. Then, without him
revealing anything you tell him the sum. The sum will be
![S_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is the weaker condition which can be converted to a magic square
for all ![n\\ge
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cge+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Finally, we will consider another sequence that can be derived like the
above. It is the simple sum of pyramidal and tetrahedral numbers without
shifting the latter by 2 terms as we did above to get
![S_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, this new sequence is:

![I_n = \\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} +\\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}
=\\dfrac{n(n+1)^2}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_n+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%282n%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D+%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%28n%2B2%29%7D%7B6%7D+%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%5E2%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![I_n:](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_n%3A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
**2, 9, 24, 50, 90, 147, 224, 324, 450, 605, 792, 1014, 1274, 1575,
1920, 2312, 2754, 3249, 3800, 4410…**

We observe that this sequence defines the sum of the integers in the
interstices between triangular numbers (Figure 6). Further, it also has
a geometric interpretation in the form of the area of the triangular
number trapezium (Figure 6). Successive, triangular number trapezia are
defined by the following 4 points: ![(0,T_n); (T_n, T\_{n+1});
(T\_{n+1},T\_{n+2}); (T_n+1,
0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2CT_n%29%3B+%28T_n%2C+T_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29%3B+%28T_%7Bn%2B1%7D%2CT_%7Bn%2B2%7D%29%3B+%28T_n%2B1%2C+0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These trapezia always have an integral area equal to
![I_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
starting from 9.

The exams were over and the last semester of toil was all that stood
between Vidrum and the dim glimmer he saw at the end of his metaphorical
tunnel. He finally had some free time that he wished to savor in full.
He had been so busy with his studies that he was still unclear as to how
to spend that pleasant autumn morning. Just then he got a message from
his friends Sharad and Murund that they would like to drop by. Seeing
the opening for some activity he asked them to come over quickly and get
some breakfast along for him. As they filled themselves with the viands
at Vidrum’s place Sharad and Murund took off on politics. Ere long
Sharad had launched into an interminable exposition of the electoral
politics of the day: “The Tiger Party has won the elections for the
municipal corporation in the South Visphotaka constituency. Vidbandhan
Singh of the Kangress-Secular Party has won the elections for the Zilla
Parishad at Shengaon. Lakkiraju of the Cycle Party has beaten the 5
times incumbent Potturaju for Sarpanch at Sarvepalli.” Thus, he went on
and on. Murund: “The education policy of the Hindu-dal sucks. I don’t
know why you still support it Vidrum. I am sure it is under the
influence of Somakhya and Sharvamanyu.” Sharad: “Indeed, I believe it
will be a major factor in the Mahanagarapalika elections in
Turushkarajanagara where the Moslems might form an alliance with 4 other
backward caste jāti-s because of the introduction of the 50-50 marks
policy for the local language and national language.”

Vidrum was trying hard to be polite but the blow-by-blow analysis being
presented by Sharad with interjections from Murund was getting too much
for him to bear. Just then Sharad was about to launch into his
speculations regarding the upcoming speech of Ram Mandir Mishra on
“Hinduism as Secularism”. As though to show the sign of participation,
Vidrum knowledgeably asked: “Is that election for the Mahanagara Nigama
at Surat going to be indicative of the success of the Hindu-dal? in the
national elections?” Sharad’s jaw dropped at his host’s ignorance and he
went quiet for a few seconds trying to recover. Taking advantage of the
silence Vidrum remarked: “Friends, I need to go to college to retrieve
something I left behind.” Perhaps, it hit Sharad that his grand lecture
was a waste or perhaps he felt a bit let down by Vidrum’s disinterest;
whichever was the case, he and Murund decided to leave along with Vidrum
and go their own way. In reality, Vidrum had nothing to retrieve — it
was just a ruse to end the incessant patter of Sharad’s monologues. In
any case, Vidrum was a bit of a changed man these days and he thought he
could just do some calming reading in the library, catch some lunch and
plan the rest of the day and beyond. There, he came across an article on
dolmens and cists to the South West that was located among some
reasonable rock-climbing spots. He thought that it might be a great idea
to rope in some of his friends to explore that site.

At the library he sighted Vrishchika and went up to her: “Vrishchika,
thanks for all those cheat-sheets you generated for pharmacology and
biochemistry — it really clinched the day for me”. Vri: “Well, is good
to hear that. Unlike you, I still have a couple of stupid exams to
finish before I’m a free bird.” Vid: “Why would you need to study?”.
Vri: “Well I could certainly pass them without studying but if you are
in this business of beating others it takes more effort, just as the
guys say you need to keep up the practice if you have to be in fighting
shape.” Vid: \`How is your sister Lootika? is she done with her exams?”
Vri: “Yes, if you wait for half an hour, you will see her swing by —
today we are riding back with our father.” Vid: “What happened to her
aśva?”. Vri: “You wouldn’t believe it. We were attacked two days ago by
those loutish gangster boys Samikaran et al. They broke the spokes of
her aśva; so, it is under repair now.” Vid: “That is awful of them. What
happened?” Vri: “When we were returning home they whistled at us and
displayed some lewd gestures. Lootika asked me to ignore them but I lost
my cool and lunged at them with my bike and hit one. Then one of them
drew a knife then, and Lootika tried to hit him with her bike when
Samikaran drew a stick and skewered her spokes. She fell off her aśva
but both of us recovered our bikes, sprayed the camphor-mangrove juice
mixture we have developed on their faces, and were able to make away
swiftly.” Vid: “Wow — well done — that is quite an improvement on your
part!” Vri: “It was a bit of a risk but I think quite a few of the
public saw what happened and they might be a bit wary now on. We will be
banking on your help if we need it.” Vid: “Not exactly in a mood for
gangster fighting but don’t worry — if required my billhook will be
there to help you.”

A little while later Lootika came by to take her sister along. Vidrum
inquired regarding her bike and mentioned to her his plan to explore the
place with dolmens and cists to the southwest: “Do try to come along
tomorrow. I’m now heading to tell Somakhya and some others who are
likely to be interested.” L: “Sounds exciting, see you tomorrow at the
railway station.”

The next day Vidrum with a band of 7 of his friends were exploring the
strange landscape near Siddhakoṭa, which they had reached after a 1.5 hr
train ride and an hour’s walk thereafter. Many interesting structures
caught the eye of Somakhya and Lootika though it did not interest the
rest too much. However, as was usual, Vidrum and Sharvamanyu hung around
with them listening to the comments they might make. They soon found a
series of menhirs that seemed to trace out a winding path along a slope
leading to a shelf in the basaltic rock. Somakhya: “This is a sign of
megalithic settlement in the area. From the irregular shapes of the
menhirs, the site seems to be from an earlier megalithic phase predating
the Aryan contact and the Dravidian expansion.” Lootika sighted a
strange painting on the wall with circles and lemniscate-like figures:
“Hey, this might be a sign of an even earlier settlement”. Somakhya then
shouted out to the rest as he found a chalcedony microlithic core:
“Indeed, the art on the rock might have been as early as the
Mesolithic”. Then Sharvamanyu went to join the rest as someone called
him and Vidrum took a little detour with Somakhya and Lootika to climb
some cliff faces. Vidrum made an improbable climb and reached a ledge
with an overhang. He shouted out to his companions that he had found an
inscription with more rock art. Neither Somakhya nor Lootika could go up
the way Vidrum had done but after a while, they found another easier
path up and joined Vidrum on the ledge. They remarked that they could
not read the script but it seemed to be of early Cālukyan provenance by
its form. They then saw the rock art Vidrum had found — it depicted an
elaborate battle scene with elephants, horses and headhunters — clearly
of an age far removed from the Mesolithic art they had seen earlier.
Somakhya wondered if given the inscription and the location it marked a
record of a historic battle fought between the Cālukya-s and the
Pallava-s.

![bhagya2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bhagya2.jpg)

The other clump of the remaining five friends headed up a tumulus
adjacent to the rock faces the three were exploring. There, Sharvamanyu
found a strange rock with cupules. He remembered Somakhya and Lootika
showing him such a rock in the past that made musical notes when struck.
He tried the same with this rock and it gave out a sonorous jangle. Soon
the rest of them were striking a rock trying to make music with the
rock. Bhagyada, one of the five, suddenly said that she heard Lootika
call her and ran towards a dolmen that lay just beyond the singing rock.
The music they were making reached the ears of Vidrum and his two
companions; Vidrum: “I presume they have found a singing rock like the
one you had shown us near Vināyakakoṭa.” Suddenly, the air was pierced
by a shrill cry of horror and pain and everything went silent. Lootika:
“Friends let us get back to the rest. That is the yell of my friend
Bhagya. I fear something terrible has happened to her.” It took them
some time to join the rest because Lootika in her disquiet for her
friend almost slipped and fell while getting down from the ledge. When
they reached the rest of their companions, they saw them clustered
around Bhagyada and fanning her. Vidrum stepped forward and checked her
pulse and sprinkled water on her from a water bottle. As he was
attending to her, Sharvamanyu remarked: “Lootika, this is strange. She
said she had heard you call her and went under that dolmen. We then
heard her utter a cry and found her collapsed. When we tried to get her
out of the dolmen, I swear to you, even though the roof is high enough
for us to get beneath it we felt as though someone had given us a hard
knock on the head. It is still aching a lot.” Lootika: “That is strange
indeed! We were a bit of a distance away and I did not call anyone — we
heard your music and her cry but, as you saw, it took us some time to
reach you all.”

In the meantime, Bhagyada had woken up but was uttering something that
sounded like gibberish to most. Somakhya: “That is very strange. It is
pretty linguistic though not understandable — it sounds like some type
of an unknown Dravidian language.” Seeing Lootika clutching her friend
and trying to calm her down Somakhya took out a powder made of theanine,
a cactus and Brāhmī handed it to Lootika: “Gautamī, make her a tea from
this.” Some time after taking that tea she gradually stopped uttering
the copious gibberish and seemed to slip into a dazed trance. Vidrum
came up to Lootika who was still holding Bhagyada: “Lootika this seems
to be something in your realm — I don’t know of her ever having any such
problem in all these years.” Suddenly, something clicked in Lootika’s
mind and she sprang up and ran under dolmen. She instantly recoiled
holding her chest, stumbled out of it and ran back to Somakhya’s side:
“Somakhya, its occupant seems pretty aggressive and I’d say malevolent —
see how he tricked Bhagya into his lair by mimicking me. We need to
subdue this guy forcefully!” Vidrum: “Will Bhagya continue to be in this
trance-like state? What do we do now, we need to get back too!”
Somakhya: “Give us half an hour; hopefully we can restore her to
normalcy.” Drawing Lootika aside, he pointed to a spot under a tamarind
tree and whispered: “It is very opportune that we have a tamarind tree
there. Go under it and call upon the West-facing Sadyojāta-rudra
surrounded by the 24 yoginī-s: Śarabhānanā, Suvīrā, Vajribhā, Rāśibhā,
Cakravartī, Śauṇdī, Khadgakarṇā, Mahātapā, Cakravegā, Mahāyāmyā,
Subhadrā, Gajakarṇikā, Carā, Somādevī, Gavākṣī, Vāyuvegagā, Airāvatī,
Mahānāsā, Daṃṣṭrālī, Sukarkaśā, Vedhanī, Bhaṭṭā, Droṇā and Kākenakā. I
will call upon the Skanda in the midst of the four Vināyaka-s under that
kadamba tree. Then we shall go in.”

For half an hour, which seemed like a whole day, the rest of the group
was impatiently and tensely milling around their incapacitated friend
constantly remarking that they were taking a risk with Somakhya and
Lootika’s hocus-pocus. They suggested that they should try to support
her begin the gradual trudge back to the station for it would take a
while with Bhagyada in such a condition. However, Vidrum and Sharvamanyu
said they should give the two their chance and in any case giving her
some time to recover might not be a bad idea as her vitals seemed
alright beyond some elevation of her pulse rate. Having completed their
dhyāna, Somakhya and Lootika entered the spacious dolmen. They felt some
invisible barrier trying to keep them out but Lootika remarked: “I think
the great yoginī-s have drawn him into our control” as they pushed
through. Somakhya: “For a good mantravādin well-versed in the
Yoginīsaṃcara, there is no bhūta that cannot be subdued with Rudra and
the 24 devī-s emanating from the arṇa-s of the Tatpuruṣa-ṛk. But a
lesser mortal might need other mechanisms like the śakti of Kumāra with
the Vināyaka-s, or Khaḍgarāvaṇa or Caṇḍāsi.” Once inside, they saw a
peculiar figure drawn on the ceiling — it almost seemed like a hybrid of
old rock art on which was superimposed a more recent marking of letters.
The two made an etching of it on paper and placed it in the circle of
the 24 and performed bhūta-bandhana. Just as they were finishing, they
heard the relieved shouts of their companions. As they emerged from the
dolmen, they saw Bhagyada quite completely recovered. Bh: “I think I
might have hit my head on the rock and lost my wits from trauma.”
Heaving a collective sigh of relief, they decided to return from that
place which had clearly frightened most of them. Lootika placed the
etchings in her backpack and told Somakhya that she would make a fair
copy and send it over to him.

![bhagya1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bhagya1.jpg)

As they hopped off the train at their home station, they shouted out
goodbyes and reached for their local conveyances to get back home.
Bhagyada gave Lootika a ride home on her motorized two-wheeler. She hung
around with Lootika for a while yarning about the strange incident whose
focus she was. As Lootika chatted with her friend, she made a clear
color copy of the etching and handed it over to Bhagyada as she was
parting: “Bhagya, you stay close to Somakhya’s house — just drop this
with him as you head home. I’m going to be busy with some experiments
next two days but we’ll go to the clothing-stores on Friday afternoon.”
Bhagyada was flush with some cash from her internship. Hence she decided
to call her friend Charusmita to accompany her to an eatery for dinner.
Later that night, as Somakhya was writing an entry of the day’s
adventures in his scrapbook, his mother came into his room. She seemed a
bit agitated: “Do you know of the whereabouts of your classmate
Bhagyada. Her mother is on the phone — she has apparently not returned
home.” S: “Call Lootika’s mom — she was to drop off Lootika at her
house.” Somakhya overheard his mother speaking to Lootika’s mother and
learning that Bhagyada had left her home a long time ago and suggesting
that they file a missing person report.

The next day Lootika was to help her mother in teaching the secret
kula-prayoga of the Śrī-sūkta to her sisters Varoli and Jhilleeka. She
was excited about it as she had obtained a picture from Somakhya’s
mother of an archaeological site in the North that informed her of its
unexpectedly ancient origins. However, Lootika found her mother was
rather restless with the case of her friend’s disappearance. Just then
Vrishchika came out of her study and gave them the news of what had
happened. Even as Bhagyada had said goodbye to her friend after dinner
and was heading to the parking lot, she was accosted by Samikaran and
his friend Mohammad Omar. They asked her to join them for some
recreational substance inhalation. She refused but they kept engaging
her and preventing her from leaving the spot. After some time it got
more threatening and an aggressive encounter ensued. She tried to reach
her vehicle and flee but her accosters pulled out its carburetor and
threw it away into a gutter. She then tried to make a call when they
seized her phone and backpack. Just then a jeep of the cops passed by
and they fled with her belongings after pushing her into the drain.
Eventually, the cops brought her home but told her that any
investigation of Mohammad Omar without stronger evidence would not be
easy as he was connected with the much-feared boss of the Majlis Party
and that Samikaran was a respectable medical intern. L: “Oh dear! That’s
awful. But Vrishchika you are such a lokasaṃcāriṇi. How did you get to
know this — she is my classmate after all.” Vrishchika smirked at her
sister and said: “They had taken her to the college hospital for a
checkup; thus, I learnt from my sources.” L: “Let me go and check on
her.” Her mother was a bit alarmed: “Lootika, why don’t you do that
later. Let us finish the lesson now. I don’t want you or Vrishchika
picking up any more scraps with those rowdies. This or worse could have
happened to both of you’ll a few days back. These are dangerous guys and
nobody can save you if they kidnap you all.”

Several years had passed since those incidents. Dr. Samikaran was
preparing for a beef party at his house along with Rabri Chatterjee of
the Maoist Party. The big man in attendance was going to be the rising
star, Mohammad Omar. He had just been appointed as the country head of
the multinational, Social Platforms, by its mleccha bosses Joe Dremel
and Joanna Ting. In the honor of his guest, Samikaran had ensured that
there was going to no alcohol, and the beef was halal; nevertheless, to
sweeten the deal for all the party-goers, different recreational
substances were being provided. Soon Mohammad Omar was in attendance and
he made a speech about how his company was going to make a big donation
for Samikaran’s Bamman Haṭāo organization for its drive for medical
assistance to the hill-tribes of the Nahali territory. He received a
long ovation and many a young woman crept up beside him seeking his
attention. He occasionally complimented one or the other of them for
their progressive ideals and asked them to drop him a call and send
along their CVs. Some minor players from the movie industry would also
mill around him begging for a special account on Social Platforms. Thus,
they partied hard till little after midnight, when Samikaran and
Mohammad Omar rounded up some of the women whom they had picked and
asked them to continue partying in a smaller room to the side. They said
they would join them a little later as they had to briefly attend to
some official issues.

Locking up the women in that room Chatterjee, Samikaran and Mohammad
Omar retired to a secret chamber. There MO guffawed loudly and stroking
his ample beard remarked that the party was great and that Samikaran had
done a good job with the guest list. He then said that now that he was
in control he had a mechanism to ban all Hindutva accounts on Social
Platforms. He also said he had legion of “players” who would set up fake
Hindutva accounts and make them a “heck of a laughing stock very soon,
all the way to the prime minister.” He said he had the full secret
backing of justice Shashi Yabhak and his network of contacts if it ever
got legal. Samikaran smiled in acknowledgment even as Chatterjee asked
him about the planned riots to disrupt the speech of the Finance
Minister Danesh Gupta. MO declared that it would be a riot like none
before and the government will be embarrassed beyond words before an
international audience. He then excused himself with a wink saying he
“wanted to spend some time with the ladies”. Samikaran said that was
what the party was for and asked him to have fun. However, Mohammad Omar
was soon rudely interrupted in his fun as Chatterjee rushed in and told
him that Samikaran wanted him back as there was something very serious
happening.

MO: “Why the #\*%! did you want me, Sami?” Smk: “Listen, this is
super-serious stuff. My spies have just informed me that the Special
Task Force has been activated to arrest you for the killing of the
intelligence officer during the March riots and are headed this way.”
MO: “How the hell could they know?” Smk: “See, I’ve told you to be
careful with the girls. I believe it is one of them who was a mole.” MO:
“I’ll burn her alive.” Smk: “We will do that later; now you need to run.
I suggest you quickly get on to the mofussil road leading to Amirpur and
make your way to the bunker I’ve installed under Sultanganj Mohalla with
the help of our Chinese comrades. Our agents can then sneak you out of
the country.” MO: “Bro, why panic so much. My lawyers and his honor’s
network will get me out in hours. I can then use that as good propaganda
for our cause.” Chatterjee: “This is serious. They know that you have
done that before. This time around they might either “encounter” you or
have some thug bump you off as soon as you’re in jail. So, listen and
run.” MO: “What about you guys?” Smk: “Nobody can do much to a
respectable MD whom even politicians consult.”

Suddenly, it dawned on Mohammad Omar that the noose might indeed be
tightening around him. He quickly jumped into his truck and started
driving away as Samikaran had suggested.

![bhagya4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bhagya4-1.jpg)

Lootika suddenly sat up on the bed, as though startled by a dream.
Somakhya was half-awakened by it but instinctively pulled wife back on
to the pillow and lapsed in slumber again. That morning at breakfast, S:
“Gautami, did something bother you in your sleep.” L: “Why? I don’t
know. Now that you ask, I think I woke up from a tense dream and then
had a really good sleep for some reason. Ah! Now I recall. For some
reason, that strange rock art we had seen in the dolmen at Siddhakoṭa
flashed vividly in my sleep.” S: “I’d almost forgotten that. Did you
ever save the etching we made? That was supposed to be a khārkhoḍa. I
wonder what is going to happen with a khārkhoḍa, which bound an
aggressive fellow like that one, floating around.” L: “Let me think… I
remember now. I did send the khārkhoḍa over to you with Bhagya but that
was the day she was assailed by the louts and I believe it was among the
items stolen from her and never recovered.”

A little later Vidrum was hosting Bhagyada and her husband Sandeep at
his residence. As they were rambling about the old days, the topic
veered to the Siddhakoṭa adventure and its aftermath. Bhagyada was still
rather shaken by its mention. Vidrum: “I think in the least you might
feel some comfort from this news item I saw a little while back.” Let me
read it: “ June 27th. The Special Task Force had identified the head of
Social Platforms, India, as the mastermind of the recent riots in
various cities. It was alleged that he had created a network of
university students, doctoral scholars and street ruffians to
orchestrate these riots in various cities and that he was directly
involved in arranging the assassination of the intelligence officer Mr.
Vir Singh. It was also alleged that he had used his power to ban various
pro-Hindutva accounts on Social Platforms and spreading false rumors
about them and the government. As the Special Task Force headed to
arrest him, he is said to have driven off on his truck via the mofussil
roads. The observers say that for some unknown reason he suddenly veered
his truck on to the Siddhakoṭa road and speed straight to the
archaeological site in the hills. He abruptly abandoned his truck and
ran up the hills to a dolmen where he was found dead with his skull
smashed in. In his truck, several goods were recovered, which the STF
claimed to have been stolen over the years from female victims whom he
had lured. His case was heard yesterday and Justice Shashi Yabhak
dismissed the charges against the deceased as frivolous and his death
was ruled a suicide. Social Platforms CEO Joe Dremel condoled the death
of his employee and declared him as a greater fighter against the dark
forces of fascism, Hindutva and brahminist supremacy that were shredding
the democratic fabric of India.” Vidrum: “Bhagya, I wonder if your
stolen items were among those recovered in the truck.”

In our times the Christian Anglo-Saxons were famous for their “war on
drugs”. However, in the 1800s, when they lorded over India, they were
famous as global drug dealers. On the morning of August 25, 1865 CE
around 9:00 AM, one such dealer, Mr. Peppe (titled the sub-deputy opium
agent), was making his rounds overseeing his Indian serfs laboring in
the poppy fields at Sherghati in Bihar. The still air on that cloudy day
was pierced by an earth-shattering detonation — a stone had fallen from
the heavens. The laborers reaching the place in the fields where it had
fallen recovered a 5 kilogram heavenly stone buried knee-deep in the
mud. The stone was conveyed to a senior drug dealer, Costley (titled
Deputy Magistrate of Sherghati). After examining it, he did not believe
it was a meteorite because it did not resemble that which he had known
to have fallen from the skies in Faridpur, in 1850 CE. However, Peppe
confirmed that he has seen it fall in the poppy fields; thus, it
survived being discarded. Eventually, it landed in the hands of the
English tyrants of Bengal who promptly conveyed it to the British Museum
in London, where the meteor-collector Mervyn Herbert Nevil Story
Maskelyne was greedily gobbling up the meteorites that his agents from
India would supply. It so happened that this 5kg stone was a little
piece of Martian real estate, which became the founding member of a
class of Martian meteorites known as the shergottites.

Having read this tale in our early youth, alongside our first sightings
of meteors as though cast from the mouth of the Kṣetrapāla, we became
increasingly interested in meteoroids and meteorites. Soon we learnt
that these objects offer windows into the solid material of the solar
system and the very origin of planets such as earth. Meteoroids have
diverse origins. Some, like the progenitors of the shergottites, are
pieces of other planetary bodies like Mars, the asteroid Vesta and the
Moon. Yet others are the dust of comets or fragments of cometary nuclei.
These are behind the meteor showers which occur when the earth crosses a
cometary orbit and cometary dust burns up in the atmosphere from
friction, resulting in visible meteors. However, the most common are
material left from the collisional and accretionary process that formed
the rocky planets. Such collisions continue to occur in the asteroid
belt generating meteoroids. Some such meteoroids survive the atmospheric
burnout and drop to the surface of the earth. Every year a flux of at
least
![10^7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
kg of meteorites reaches the earth and the bigger pieces are much sought
after by collectors to this date. In the past 2 centuries, it has become
clear that there is much diversity among meteorites. One way of
classifying them (by no means exhaustive) is shown Figure 1.

The iron meteorites are largely inorganic, ![\\ge

metals like iron and nickel. We read in the memoirs of the Mogol tyrant
Jahangir:

“One of the strangest things that happened during this period occurred
on the thirtieth of Farvardin of the present year \[April 9, 1621\] in a
village in the pargana of Jalandhar. At dawn a tremendous noise arose in
the east. It was so terrifying that it nearly frightened the inhabitants
out of their skins. Then, in the midst of the tumultuous noise,
something bright fell to the earth from above. The people thought fire
was falling from heaven. A moment later the noise ceased, and the people
regained their composure. A swift messenger was sent to Muhammad Sa’id
the tax collector to inform him of the event. He got on his horse at
once and went to the site to see for himself. For a distance of ten or
twelve ells \[ ![\\approx
11.5-14](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+11.5-14&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
m\] in length and breadth the earth had been so scorched that no trace
of greenery or plants remained and it was still hot. He ordered the
earth dug up. The deeper they dug, the hotter it was. Finally they
reached a spot where a piece of hot iron appeared. It was so hot it was
as though it had been taken out of a furnace. After a while it cooled
off, and Muhammad Sa’id took it home with him. He placed it in a purse,
sealed it, and sent it to court. I ordered it weighed in my presence. It
weighed 160 tolas \[ ![\\approx
1.866209](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1.866209&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
kg\]. I ordered Master Daud to make a sword, dagger, and knife of it and
show them to me.” (translation by Wheeler M. Thackston)

This is a classic example of an iron meteorite, which was probably the
first source of iron used by humans sometime before the regular iron
age. In contrast, the stony iron meteorites feature different kinds of
mixtures of metals and minerals. The stony meteorites are usually
divided into chondrites which have “chondrules” and achondrites which
lack them. Chondrules are crystalline material derived from molten
silicate droplets. The shergottites and related Martian meteorites are
typically classified as achondrites. The stony meteorites often contain
organic and inorganic carbon. The presence of organic compounds was
first noticed in the carbonaceous meteors by the famous early modern
chemists Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Marcellin Berthelot. But the
significance of these organic compounds came to the fore only after the
dramatic event that took place on 28 September 1969 10:58 AM near a
place called Murchison in Australia. A blazing bolide flew into earth
breaking up initially into 3 pieces and vanishing with a cloud of smoke
followed by an earthquake. One fragment smashed through a barn and fell
on the hay without any deaths. A search of the location recovered
numerous fragments totaling to over 100 kg. This came to be known as the
famous Murchison meteorite. An analysis of its composition revealed that
it had
![\>10\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3E10%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
water and ![\\approx
2.2\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+2.2%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
carbon by weight, consistent with its smoky disintegration.

Since then the organics of the Murchison meteorite have been intensely
studied and the following have been detected: 1) Over 70 distinct amino
acids; 2) fatty acids; 3) purines; 4) pyrimidines; 5) A complex mixture
of sugars; 6) alcohols; 7) aldehydes; 8) ketones; 9) amines; 10) amides;
11) aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; 12) some heterocyclic
aromatics; 13) ethers; 14) organo-sulfur and organo-phosphorus
compounds. Some of these are at very low concentrations like amines
while fatty acids are quite abundant. The fact that these compounds show
a mixture of chiralities and a distinct Carbon 13 isotopic signature
showed that they had a celestial rather than an earthly biological
origin. Given that the Murchison meteorite represents material as old or
considerably older than the Earth, it established beyond doubt that
interstellar organic matter was a component of the material that formed
the original rocky bodies of the solar system. It also suggests that
upon accretion into asteroidal bodies, the originally simple
interstellar organic molecules reacted abiotically by the action or
water and heat to form the entire range of more complex molecules that
could serve as building blocks of life. However, given that life is
characterized by homochirality of its building blocks, it also suggested
at least a subset of such bodies was not transmitting life itself but
only its building blocks.

In our youth, when we first read of the Murchison meteorite, we believed
the majority view that meteors such as this had delivered the building
blocks of life to the early Earth and it was followed by local
pre-biotic evolution resulting in life. However, as our understanding of
biology improved we increasingly started moving towards panspermia
though cellular life on Earth had a single common ancestor. First, the
archaeo-bacterial split implied a certain barrier to lateral gene
transfer that had since then broken down on Earth. This could be most
easily explained by two seeding events, one which brought the bacteria
and the other which brought the archaea. Second, consistent with the
above, there are many protein divergences among housekeeping functions
that imply divergence time that likely greater than the age of the
Earth, even assuming early acceleration in virus-like primitive
replicators. Third, genomic analysis strongly favors a heterotrophic
ancestral organism. Abundant food sources that would have allowed such
organisms to get started before autotrophy evolved are not likely to
have existed on the early Earth. Being in the hot inner Solar System it
is less likely to have had materials like tholins that would have fed
the early heterotrophs. Hence, we again see hints that life emerged
elsewhere in a tholin-rich region and secondarily reached Earth. Thus,
we came to see the Murchison meteorite and other carbonaceous chondrites
as merely part of a spectrum of stony material with interstellar
organics and their processed products which went all the way to life.
Thus our view was that some such body could have delivered life to Earth
from outside.

The key to this, which still remains quite mysterious, is the emergence
of homochirality. Laboratory organic syntheses attempting to mimic
prebiotic processes do not easily reproduce the homochiral constraint
typical of biosynthesis. In our adulthood, even as we were locked in
other scientific explorations, new studies on the Murchison meteorite
that cleverly avoided the effects of contamination and racemization
indicated that there was a ![\\approx
2-9\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+2-9%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
excess of L-enantiomers among the amino acids found in it. This
supported the hypothesis that there was an initial step wherein a
limited anisotropy was established (as seen on the meteorite) followed
by an amplification step with selection for one enantiomer. This brought
the focus on certain earlier studies in organic chemistry which have
shown that asymmetric photolysis by circularly polarized light could
produce notable enantiomeric excess (e.g. the photolysis of camphor).
Thus, early on, it had been proposed that pulsars emitting circularly
polarized synchrotron radiation could have caused the initial
enantiomeric anisotropy. But it has been pointed out that such radiation
could break up amino acids. Others have hence suggested circularly
polarized light scattered from dusty regions in the Milky Way could
provide the appropriate light for such reactions. Such light has been
directly observed in the reflection nebulae of the OMC-1 star-forming
cloud in the Orion region, which is rich in organic compounds. However,
the energetics of this proposal remains to be understood because UV
radiation could destroy the amino acids. In any case, the photochemical
enantiomer selection remains the most likely possibility, and those
conditions are not found on Earth. This suggests that enantiomeric
excess happened in space. Now one could still argue that after this
excess was established such an enantiomerically biased mixture was
delivered to Earth by meteorites and that provided the building blocks
for life on Earth. However, this does not take into account the
racemization and re-equilibration of enantiomers on Earth post-landing.
Hence, we see this as additional support to the idea that life formed
close to the site where the enantiomeric excess was already established
and maintained and then seeded on Earth.

An unintended consequence of the dramatic Murchison fall has been the
relative neglect of other types of meteorites. On 26 April 1895 CE
multiple detonations were heard over what is today Uttar Pradesh and
four stones fell from the sky. Two of the pieces were found at Bishunpur
(942 g) and Parjabatpur (97 g), 1.8 km apart. The insatiable appetite of
the British mineralogists for meteorites resulted in them being promptly
shipped to the British Museum in London to become one of the famous
representative specimens of the ordinary class of chondrites. It has
been subject to several studies and was reliably shown to contain at
least two organics, toluene and dimethyl ethyl naphthalene. Indeed, the
ordinary chondrites contain a considerable amount of organic compounds
(probably more than Murchison) but their composition and concentrations
remain poorly explored, indicating that Murchison-type carbonaceous
chondrites cannot be considered the sole candidates for vehicles of
organic compounds. Further, the shergottites have been reliably shown to
contain aromatic and alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, phenol and
benzonitrile. The famous Allan Hills 84001, which was found in
Antarctica, also belonging to the Martian class, was initially claimed
to contain fossils of bacteria but this claim should be seen as plainly
dubious as those structures can also form through inorganic processes.
Nevertheless, this meteorite contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Given that these compounds are fairly common on rocky asteroid material
and comets, it is unlikely that they have special significance for the
formation of the building blocks of life. However, a better study of
these might still give us clues regarding the possible baselines for
organics forming on various rocky planets of the Solar System.

Finally, we come to the question if any of these asteroids resemble the
Earth in their composition? The simple answer is no. However, over the
years several workers have been invoking the parent-bodies of
enstatites, which are magnesium silicate-containing chondrites, as
possible candidates for the progenitors of the Earth. While the Earth as
it stands is not identical to the composition of the enstatites they do
have similar isotopic signatures to terrestrial rocks making them a
likely contributor to the origin of the Earth. Astrochemists have
invoked their high
![^{15}N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5E%7B15%7DN&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
content to propose that the high carbon content in the enstatite
chondrites was derived from an organic precursor. However, having
undergone thermal metamorphosis in the inner Solar System it has been
mostly converted to a graphite-like material. Recently, enstatites have
been in the news because a recent study has shown that they contain
sufficient Hydrogen with a specific isotopic signature to have
contributed to the emergence of a major fraction of the water on the
Earth. This strengthens a big role for the enstatite bodies in the
origin of the Earth and its water. Nevertheless, the ocean compositions
are not exactly of the isotopic signature one would expect from a purely
enstatite origin. The authors of the said recent study admit this fact
and propose that carbonaceous chondrites of the Ivuna-type could have
supplied additional water after the initial formation of the Earth to
result in its current isotopic signature.

What are the implications of this for the origin of life? One
possibility is that the secondary delivery of water by carbonaceous
chondrites after the initial formation of the earth from enstatite-like
material could have also been the vehicle for the seedings of life. The
presence of preexisting water from the enstatite building blocks could
have provided for already congenial conditions for the seeded life to
take root and expand. Of course, an alternative possibility exists. Most
proposals do not see the Earth as arising purely from enstatite
chondrites. Additionally, the original mix is likely to have had some
kind of carbonaceous chondrites. They too could have seeded life.
Further, we cannot rule out the role of other rarer bodies involved in
the early collisions.

Somakhya and Lootika were visiting the Śūlapuruṣadeśa for work reasons.
Unlike their ārya ancestors, they did not like being on the move much.
It was a rare occasion that both had been able to travel together and it
brought them some welcome relief as they did not have to individually
worry about not getting up on time, taking care of their luggage, or be
over-vigilant about missing some travel sign in an alien land.
Sightseeing made no sense to either without the other as a companion —
thus, their largely solitary peregrinations to date had mostly put them
past the urge of motivated sight-seeing. If at all they reminisced about
such things, their thoughts often went back to the rare memorable
occasions when they had been able to travel together to take in the
history of the locus and comment on it.

It was a brisk morning in early autumn, still not so cold as to prevent
a brief meander before they caught a train to find their way to the
flight back home. Lootika suddenly stopped before a clump of lilac
trees. She exclaimed and pulled out her phone right away to photograph.
S: “What’s the matter ūrṇāyī ?” Pointing to the light violet flowers on
the lilac trees she remarked: “Check those flowers out”. S: “Strange
ain’t it for these to be blooming on an autumn day like this?” L: “ārya,
I’d say that is ominous.” S: “Why?”

L: “Once in our youth my sisters and I had plied the bhūtacakra
(planchette) and the pointer was seized by the bhūta of a Hindu soldier
from the Marahaṭṭa country who had died from cold in Germany during
WW-2. His death narrative had eerie similarities to the story of a
Danish author titled ‘The Little Match Girl’. But he made an interesting
remark. He said that after this very place had been fire-bombed with
white phosphorus by the English marauder Bomber Harris, an agent of the
monstrous Churchill, and his merry bombers the lilac trees had
mysteriously burst into bloom in autumn. Our Marahaṭṭī was imprisoned
nearby and pressed by his German captors to participate in the clearing
of the rubble earlier that year.”

As they wandered on a bit along the beautiful street Somakhya remarked:
“I’ve not read that tale ‘The Little Match Girl’ but everything seems
rather ironic here and I get a vague sense of why you termed it as
ominous. Ironically, the Europeans came to know of Phosphorus in this
very place due to a śūlapuruṣa alchemist Brandt — who obtained it from
nṛmūtra. It is possible he was inspired by the transmission by
marūnmatta-s of a similar discovery of the element by rasasiddha-s like
Nāgārjuna who in their tantra-s mention a similar substance with a
suvarṇa-prabha, i.e. phosphorescence, being extracted from the same
source. That very rasa came to destroy the city in which it was
isolated!”

L: “Interesting indeed. The tangled connections get ghostly for me
because the ‘match’ in the title of the story I mentioned refers to
matchstick which again was made from P.” S: “What is the story?
Paraphrase it for me if you feel so inclined.” L: “Let us start walking
towards the railway station and I’ll give you the gist of it. In short,
it is the tale of a little European girl who was sent out to the streets
to sell match sticks. While she was doing so on the dark evening of the
last day of the year, she lost the big slippers of her mother she was
wearing as they slipped off her feet while evading traffic on the
street. With snow, she started getting hypothermic and was afraid to
return home as she might be abused for not having sold a single match
that day. Reaching the end of her endurance from the cold, she sat down
near a house and lit a match to warm herself — then another and so on.
Each time she lit a match she had a phantasmagoria before finally
perishing from the cold at the climax of her visions. The author
concluded by stating that when her corpse was found the next day the
people had no clue of the pleasant phantasmagoria she had witnessed
before dying. Verily, my sister Vrishchika would paradoxically remark
‘for some the coming of Vivasvān’s black son is the most pleasant climax
of their existence’. Now, that Hindu soldier who died in somewhere in
these regions also had run of phantasmagoria before meeting his end
which he narrated to us — it certainly sent a chill through me before I
performed a śamanam to set him at peace and it positively shook my
sisters to the core for several days.”

S: “Ah, the tale reminds me of one we had to study for an apabhraṃśa
examination titled diyāsalāī kī kahānī. I wonder if the writer was
inspired in some way by that of the Dane. In any case, you have to tell
me of the Marahaṭṭa’s phantasmagoria.”

By then they had reached a souvenir shop near the railway station.
There, they were greeted by a Japanese man whom they had made
acquaintance of at the meeting for which they were there. He too was
taking the same train as them; so, they did decide to go together. He
asked Somakhya and Lootika to join him in checking out the souvenirs as
he wanted to buy something for his kids. As they were doing so they were
joined by a mahāmleccha who too they had made acquaintance of at the
past meeting. He too went to the shop to purchase some porcine meat and
a bottle of an alcoholic beverage. He was headed towards Trivargadeśa
and somewhat nervously remarked: “I hope my train arrives on time.” The
Japanese man responded: “While not as punctual as in Japan the trains
here usually keep good time.” The mahāmleccha responded with a smirk:
“Thanks, I know you guys have completely outdone your erstwhile allies
even as we dismantled our own railroads as though we taking the Nazi
supply chains to the scrapyard.” The Japanese: “We were not really
allies and for our population density a good rail system is very
important unlike in your part of the world.” The mahāmleccha: “Sorry, I
was just joking.” With that, they all headed into the station and the
mahāmleccha soon caught his train to head for his destination.

A little later the two with their ati-prācya fellow traveler found
themselves on speeding away on the train from their kṣetra of the past
week. Perhaps due to the phlegmatic disposition of their fellow
traveler, they remained quiet for some time before he suddenly pointed
to a decrepit monument that sped past them. With dark clouds hanging
about it, it presented a melancholy specter. The J: “That is a ruin from
the fire-bombing during WW-2. Even Tokyo was similarly reduced to ashes.
It was worse there because we used to build almost everything from wood
and paper. Here at least this solid stone structure is standing.” S and
L: “We were just talking about something related before we saw you. Bad
as this was, the burning down of Japan was evidently worse.” The J: “The
American Demon LeMay who was the mastermind of the bombing of Japan
first learnt his tricks here. But for him the Japanese were merely
cockroaches, so even if there might have been some restraint here none
of it was there when the demon came east.” S: “He was indeed a
psychopathic war-criminal but what matters is victory. If one wins then
even your psychopaths and mass-murders will be hailed as national
heroes. That was so of demon LeMay or the other mass-murderer who likely
inspired him, bomber Harris.” The J: “That is true. The biggest
humiliation for us when the government was obliged to confer on the
demon the highest Japanese honor for a foreigner! People have still not
forgotten that.”

Then, they lapsed into a silence punctuated by an occasional
conversation on more placid topics like the little rice-growing town
their interlocutor was born in with schools that hardly had 10 students
or the rare festival they still celebrated to the lord of the universe,
Mahendra. Thus, they passed the rest of their journey to the airport to
catch their flights. After the usual annoying grind of long ques,
probing harassment by security and a cab-ride lasting a few hours,
Somakhya and Lootika finally reached the house of the former’s parents
where they had left their kids. After they had settled in, Somakhya’s
mother remarked to Lootika: “Your sister Varoli was very insistent that
you all go to her place for dinner but I asked her to join us with her
family; that way it might be more fun.” L: “That’s great, it resolves
everything for me.” As was typical among the caturbhaginī, when Varoli
arrived with her husband Mitrayu and her kid, Lootika gave her a
detailed account of their visit to the land of the śūla-jana-s.
Concluding with the lilac flowers, reminiscences of the phantom of the
Marahaṭṭi soldier and their encounter with the atiprācya, Lootika
remarked: “I forgot to ask the atiprācya about why he said the Japanese
and the Nazis were not true allies. He seemed sincere about it though
the mahāmleccha took it as a sign of being coy of the casual association
he had made between the Japanese and the Reich. Somakhya, I’ve heard you
say that it was more an alliance of circumstance.”

S: “Yes, he did seem sincere and is perhaps one of the better informed
of his people. From the perspective of the outsider, the Germans of the
age adopted an essentially Galtonian framework of dealing with the
other, which accorded a certain hierarchy to races. They felt they as
Germanic people (the English included) were at the top of it, with the
Rus and the Slav below them and the melanistic peoples of the world in
the lower rungs. As for the East Asians, the cīna-s and the uṣāputra-s
they were ambivalent. But for the most part the Germans, Hitler
included, saw them with a degree of respect, unlike what mahāmleccha
commentators say. This was especially so given that the Japanese had
defeated the Germans in China during WW-1 and before that the Rus whom
the Germans had backed. Thus, they had ‘earned some respect’ of the
mleccha-s by showing themselves capable of defeating them on their own.
While in WW-1 the J had fought on the side of the English it was not due
to any particular friendship with them. Their strategic objectives were
to keep the mleccha-s out of their long-desired sphere of influence,
i.e. mainland China, which was the target of the mighty J lords since
Hideyoshi and his audacious attack on the Koreans and the Ming. Thus,
their victory against the Germans in WW-1 allowed them to conquer German
colonial and vassal territory in the east. Hence, after WW-1 when the J
began their conquest of China the Germans naturally supported the
cīna-s. It was only later they started supporting the J seeing the
practical advantage of having a power like Japan to aid them in the East
against the English and American might. Even then the śūlapuruṣa-s kept
their new J allies in the dark about their dealings with the Soviet Rus.
This of course made the J wary of the German intentions for they greatly
feared the indomitable Soviet Rus. Finally, the alliance was sealed only
because the Japanese seeing that their energy supply was being
constricted by the Americans and English decided that the way out was to
attack the Anglo-Saxon Christian powers. The J had been generally wary
of mleccha-s operating in the East as they had learnt how destructive
they could be from their actions on us and the cīna-s. So, indeed their
alliance with the śūlapuruṣa-s may be seen as a convergence of interests
due to the emergence of the English-German conflict and the English hope
of continuing their world dominance by constricting the rising Japan.”

Varoli: “That might help make sense of something which always puzzled
be: if the atiprācya-s and the śulapuruṣa-s were such close allies why
did they not attack the Soviet Rus empire in conjunction with the
Germans? That could have considerably weakened the chances of the
ultimate Rus victory in the war. When I used to ask such things in our
infamous college Right-Wing Debate club it would invariably evoke
responses like the Germans did not trust the ‘yellow race’ or that the
śūlapuruṣa-s were too proud to seek assistance from the Untermenschen of
the East.”

Mitrayu: “As ever, these types never got it that the situation on the
ground was more complicated. As Somakhya noted the śūlapuruṣa-s had
hardly been open with the atiprācya-s about their own pacts with the
Soviets. If that were the case, then the J had every reason to be wary
of entering that war from the East. Further, the J had much reason to
suspect that there could ultimately be an inter-mleccha alliance against
them, much as the well-known sarvonmatta-samāyoga happens against us —
after all, they were a heathen nation with the emperor as the head of
the Shinto religion. But the most neglected aspect in all this is the
fact the Soviet Rus had an extraordinary capacity to bleed until they
attained victory. Even the almost eusocial atiprācya-s realized that
this capacity coupled with a brutal dictator as Dzhugashvili meant that
they were unlikely to prevail. The Rus had already shown this in the
Soviet-J showdown fought at the Mongol-Manchu border-post of Khalkhin
Gol. There, the Rus and their Mongol allies led by the famous Zhukov
smashed a powerful Japanese army just before the Stalin-Hitler pact was
concluded. Through much of the battle, the Japanese and their Manchu
allies showed tactical brilliance and fought resolutely to inflict heavy
losses on the Rus side in terms of men and material. But the Rus
remained unshaken by all those losses and kept fighting relentlessly
till they were able to outflank and encircle the Japanese killing or
imprisoning more than half their men. This and an earlier Manchurian
encounter with the Soviet Rus had shown to the Japanese that it was not
the best strategy to pursue the war with the former. With this and the
śūlapuruṣa-s signing a pact with the śrava-s it was quite natural that
the J did not join the Nazis in opening an eastern front against the
Rus.”

L: “Indeed, whatever one may think of them, the tale of Rus in WW-2 has
something awful and heroic about it. The Anglo-Saxon propaganda, bought
by so many, has systematically tried to erase them from the picture, who
were the true victors of that war at a staggering human cost. Their
deaths at over 25 million dwarfs the costs incurred by the śūlapuruṣa-s,
Jews and Poles of about a 6 million each and by the Hindus of about 2.5
million.”

M: “After all much as tyrant Akbar’s Sufi shaikh-s celebrated the deaths
of the Kaffirs and fired randomly into their midst as Mana Siṃha engaged
the valiant Pratāpa Siṃha, the Anglo-Saxons cheered on as the
fascist-Soviet clash played out acknowledging that a death on either
side was gain for them.”

V: “It was truly a crystallization of the statement from our national
epic: varāhasya śunaś ca yudhyatos tayor abhāve śvapacasya lābhaḥ । (In
the fight between the hog and the dog, the death of either is the gain
of the dog-eating tribesman).”

M: “That indeed was the way the Anglo-Saxon mleccha-s played the game.
They delayed opening a western front against their śūlapuruṣa cousins as
long as they could, instead choosing only those engagements in the South
that would keep English control of India and other vassals intact.
Further, they finally opened that front only when they realized the Rus
had beaten the śūlapuruṣa-s against all odds. Their claim of victory
against the Japanese with the use of nuclear weapons was another such.
After all, the Japanese had been taking heavy losses from the Phosphorus
bombs as your fellow traveler mentioned for a while and were trying to
negotiate a truce. Those had caused more harm than the āṇavāstra-s in
toto. They finally did surrender because they had been shredded in the
mainland and Sakhalin by the Soviet Rus, who were then poised to take
Hokkaido and possibly execute their emperor. To cap it all the
āṅglika-duṣṭa-mahāmleccha combine manufactured the tale that they were
the good guys fighting evil. Taking a leaf straight out of the
ādirākṣasagrantha, they made it appear that as long as they committed
genocide it was not genocide at all, much as those sanctioned by the
ekarākṣasa.”

S: “The Soviet Rus were undoubtedly the true victors of WW-2 but as we
have often seen with the mleccha-s in our own scientific endeavors
claiming our discoveries as theirs, the Franco-Anglo-Saxon entente
positioned itself conveniently to suffer the least losses among the
major belligerents to claim victory for themselves. Indeed, the
āṇavāstra-s were hardly the cause of the victory in WW-2 but it was the
Anglo-Saxon trump-card for the world that was to unfold. Its use against
Japan in WW-2 can simply be attributed to the mleccha perception of
other ethnicities as subhuman and the need to send a message to the
winners, the Soviet Rus. When WW-2 caused the mantle of mlecchādhipatyam
to finally pass from the āṅgalika-duṣṭa-s to the mahāmleccha-s, it was
the āṇavāstra-s that made the limp mleccheśa Truman turgid as a
Californian sea cucumber. As a mahāmleccha had told the Rus ambassador:
‘I am going to pull out an atomic bomb out of my hip pocket and let you
have it’, even as a Texan would have settled a score by drawing a
six-shooter from his hip keeping to their famous maxim: ‘shoot first and
ask questions later.’ Indeed, the mahāmleccha-s repeatedly wanted to use
the āṇavāstra thereafter, not just against the Rus but also on the
Cīna-s and in Campāvati but stopped only because the other members in
their own circle seemed to have been uneasy with that. Thus, the Soviet
Rus realized that they had to concede what the mahāmleccha-s and the
āṅgalika-duṣṭa-s demanded in the immediate aftermath of WW-2.”

V: “In the end, as on the Kuru field, winning and losing is often
relative and in victory, and as you say with our scientific discoveries,
a thief could turn up to steal it even as the mleccha-s stole the
victory of the Soviet Rus. But the game of a thief is open for more than
one and the Soviet Rus was the next to be play thief to get their own
āṇavāstra-s. In defeat, Japan’s heroic performance allowed it to keep
the emperor and the Shinto religion relatively intact. The śūlapuruṣa
overreach resulted in their becoming a vassal state losing many of their
lands to the surrounding states. We, for all the death taken on behalf
of the mleccha-s, were dismembered and our millennial civilizational foe
was handed the eastern and western wings of our lands. And as if to add
insult to injury were saddled with an uncle and a father of a secular
socialist nation who led us to a disastrous defeat the hands of the
Duṣṭa-cīna-s. But then as Mitrayu had consoled me when we first met,
sometimes life in the margins has its own charms. ”

L: “In the end, as the former mleccheśa had himself admitted, in their
zeal to fight the Soviet Rus they had handed their own people to a
Gestapo like police state who were kept from revolting with an abundance
of fructose-laden corn syrup and soy paste sweetening mountain-high
scoops of ice-cream and sacks of potato chips. As those bloated the
waistlines of the mahāmleccha it laid the foundations of a disease far
beyond anything their praṇidhi-s had ever imagined would emerge from
their midst. Thus, we await the unfolding of the phantasmagoria the
Hindu soldier saw before turning phantom. Unlike the pleasant passing of
Danish girl, his culminated in the climax of a roga that seized the
Bhārata-s, even as a man when ranged against his svābhāvika-vairin-s is
seized by a disease from within.”

We realized that a simple arithmetic experiment we had performed in our
youth is actually related to an unsolved problem in number theory. It
goes thus: consider the sequence of natural numbers ![n=1, 2, 3, 4
\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4+%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Then find the distance of
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to nearest prime
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that is 1) greater than or equal to
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or 2) less than or equal to
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![d_1\[n\]=p-n,
d_2\[n\]=n-p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_1%5Bn%5D%3Dp-n%2C+d_2%5Bn%5D%3Dn-p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then define the arithmetic function ![f_1\[n\]=d_1\[n\]
d_2\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bn%5D%3Dd_1%5Bn%5D+d_2%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since, 1 has no prime before it, we can either have
![f_1\[1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5B1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as undefined or assign 0 to it. The corresponding sequence goes thus:

![f_1 \\rightarrow ?, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 4
\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1+%5Crightarrow+%3F%2C+0%2C+0%2C+1%2C+0%2C+1%2C+0%2C+3%2C+4%2C+3%2C+0%2C+1%2C+0%2C+3%2C+4+%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The function as a nice shape with symmetric maxima that remind one of
reptilian teeth (Figure 1).

[![prime_Distance_1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/prime_distance_1.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/prime_distance_1.png)Figure
1.

Now, where do the successive local maxima of this function occur? If we
leave out the undefined
![f_1\[1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5B1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we see that these occur in a sequence which we call
![f_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![f_2 \\rightarrow 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 25, 29, 33, 38
\\cdots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_2+%5Crightarrow+3%2C+5%2C+8%2C+11%2C+14%2C+17%2C+20%2C+25%2C+29%2C+33%2C+38+%5Ccdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One can right away intuitively conclude that this sequence captures the
occurrences of primes in natural number space by defining some kind of
central position between them. Hence, we can more explicitly ask, what
is the relation of
![f_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the arithmetic and geometric means of successive primes behave? We
find that the above sequence ![f_2= \\lfloor \\textrm{GM}(p_n, p\_{n+1})
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_2%3D+%5Clfloor+%5Ctextrm%7BGM%7D%28p_n%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![f_2 = \\textrm{AM}(p_n, p\_{n+1}) -
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_2+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BAM%7D%28p_n%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29+-+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for primes starting with 3 onward. One can see that the local maxima of
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the values of
![f_1\[f_2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(if we count leaving out the undefined first term in
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)),
are all square numbers. These have a specific relationship to the prime
difference function ![\\textrm{pd}\[n\]=
p\_{n+1}-p_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpd%7D%5Bn%5D%3D+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D-p_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
starting from 3 (Figure 2). Given that from 3 onward every prime is odd,
the corresponding
![\\textrm{pd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be even. Then, we have the following relationship to the local
maxima in
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![f_1\[f_2\] =
\\dfrac{\\left(\\textrm{pd}\[n\]\\right)^2}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cleft%28%5Ctextrm%7Bpd%7D%5Bn%5D%5Cright%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

[![prime_Distance_2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/prime_distance_2.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/prime_distance_2.png)Figure
2.

Thus, the local maxima of
![f_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
help define a certain parabolically rescaled version of the prime
difference function, which, as we will see below, has utility in
understanding aspects of the occurrence of successive primes.

We know that ![\\textrm{AM} \\ge
\\textrm{GM}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BAM%7D+%5Cge+%5Ctextrm%7BGM%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![\\textrm{GM}(p_n,
p\_{n+1})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGM%7D%28p_n%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will never be a whole number. Thus, we can define the arithmetic
function ![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\] = \\textrm{AM}(p_n, p\_{n+1}) -
\\textrm{GM}(p_n,
p\_{n+1})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BAM%7D%28p_n%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29+-+%5Ctextrm%7BGM%7D%28p_n%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One experimentally notes the asymptotic behavior that as ![n \\to
\\infty, \\; \\textrm{pmd}\[n\] \\to
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D+%5Cto+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, this secular decay is marked local fluctuations. There are two
notable features of this (Figure 3): 1) The maximum value of
![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is 0.22503561260788 for
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which corresponds to the ![p_n=7,
p\_{n+1}=11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_n%3D7%2C+p_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can conjecture that the difference between the arithmetic and
geometric means of successive primes is always less than one fourth,
i.e. ![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\] \<
\\tfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D+%3C+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
2) The fluctuations of
![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
starting from
![n=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
exactly mirror the fluctuations defined by the local maxima of
![f_1\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![f_1\[f_2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
with the magnitude of the
![f_1\[f_2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
peak tracking the magnitude of the peak in
![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The first time a peak of given magnitude appears in
![f_1\[f_2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it has the largest corresponding effect in
![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with all subsequent appearances of the peak of the same magnitude being
increasingly muted.

Thus, we can empirically determine that (Figure 4):

![\\dfrac{f_1\[f_2\]}{\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]} \\approx 2.3 n
\\log(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Bf_1%5Bf_2%5D%7D%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D%7D+%5Capprox+2.3+n+%5Clog%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![prime_Distance_4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/prime_distance_4.png)Figure
4. The green filled curve is
![\\dfrac{f_1\[f_2\]}{\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Bf_1%5Bf_2%5D%7D%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
while the dark red curve is ![y=2.3 n

Whether there is some closed form for the constant 2.3 remains an open
question to us. After we posted this note, an acquaintance from Twitter
provided a
[proof](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dbzmt61xvNwCLEr6dXKcNLl1tjGZWxcI)
for why the constant in the above equation should be should be 2 for
large
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Prime gaps have been intensely studied since at least Legendre who had a
conjecture regarding them; several tighter variants of that conjecture
have been proposed repeatedly since then. Hence, looked up the
literature to see if our conjecture regarding the difference of the
arithmetic and geometric means of successive primes might be equivalent
to any of those. We learnt recently that it is a version of a conjecture
stated by Andrica, in 1986, just about a decade before when we began
exploring the function
![f_1\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It goes thus:

![\\sqrt{p\_{n+1}}-\\sqrt{p_n} \<
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bp_%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D-%5Csqrt%7Bp_n%7D+%3C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The form in which we present the conjecture appears to be a nice
statement of a strong version of the Andrica conjecture and
![f_1\[f_2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%5Bf_2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
provides a cleaner comparison for the fluctuations in
![\\textrm{pmd}\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bpmd%7D%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
than the simple prime gap function. Remarkably, simple as these
conjectures are, they have not been proven to date. Moreover, it seems
that even if the Riemann hypothesis were to be true, that by itself will
not imply these conjectures. Thus, yet again we have simple arithmetic
statements that can be understood or arrived at even by a school kid but
are extraordinarily difficult to prove formally. The philosophical
implications of these are interesting to us.

Pinakasena was visiting Somakhya and Lootika. He was seeking instruction
on the Sadyojāta-mantra from his hosts: “O Ātharvaṇa and Śāradvatī, I
wish to learn the rahasya-s pertaining to the deployment of the
Sadyojāta-mantra to the great god Kumāra, the patron deity of all our
clans. We have borne his worship since the time our ancestors were in
the now fallen lands of Gandhāra in Uttarāpatha. Then they bore it to
the Yaudheya republic and then to Kānyakubja during the reign of emperor
of Harṣavardhana and finally to Dakṣiṇāpatha.”

His hosts led him to their fire room and seated him on the western side
of their aupāsana-vedi. There, they asked him to purify himself for the
ritual with the sprinkling using the mantra-s to divine horse
Dadhikrāvan and the waters. Lootika then signaled to him: “Offer the
pouring with with incantation to the daughters of Rudra”. Pinakasena did
as instructed:

namo rudriyābhyo .adbhyaH svāhā \|\|

Obeisance to the daughters of Rudra. Hail to the waters.

Somakhya: “Now invoke Prajāpati the lord of the Bhṛgu-s and Aṅgiras-es
and offer fire sticks to him”.

He did as instructed:

namaḥ parameṣṭhine prajāpataye svāhā hiraṇyagarbhāya svāhā bhṛgūṇāṃ
patye svāhā .aṅgirasāṃ pataye svāhā \|\|

Then he offered tarpaṇa-s:

vasubhyo namo rudrebhyo nama ādityebhyo marudbhyo namo mārutebhyo namo
.aśvibhyāṃ namo vaiśravaṇāya namo dharmāya namaḥ kāmāya namo ṛṣibhyo
nama ārṣeyebhyo namo aṅgirobhyo nama āṅgirasebhyo namo atharvebhyo nama
ātharvaṇebhyo namaḥ \|\|

Then he recited after his hosts and made oblations at the appropriate
calls:

yaś chandasām ṛṣabho viśvarūpaś chandobhyaś chandāṃsy āviveśa \| satāṃ
śakyaḥ provācopaniṣad indro jyeṣṭa indriyāya ṛṣibhyo namo devebhyaḥ
svadhā pitṛbhyo bhūr-bhuvaḥ-suvaś chanda oṃ \|\|

He \[Indra\], who is the bull among the meters, of all forms, emerging
from the meters entered into the meters. The great one, Indra, who is
possible to be \[reached\] by the good, proclaimed the upaniṣat to the
Ṛṣi-s for attaining powers (full experience). Obeisance to the gods, for
the ancestors the good station, the 3 vyāhṛtis, the Veda, OṂ.

Then stressing to Pinakasena that his instruction was a continuation of
the tradition imparted by the god Indra to their ancient ancestors,
Somakhya began his instruction after placing a fire stick for the
repelling of the non-sacrificing foes:

\|\| ayajvanaḥ sākṣi viśvasmin bharo3m \|\|

Thereafter he instructed Pinakasena to offer a fire stick after he
recited the
[incantation](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/matters-of-religion-3/):

tvaṃ devānām asi rudra śreṣṭha

tavas tavasām ugrabāho \|

hṛṇīyasā manasā modamāna

ā babhūvitha rudrasya sūno \|\| + svāhā + idaṃ na mama \|

Somakhya: “The ṛṣi of the Sadyojāta-mantra is Gopatha. Its meter is
anuṣṭubh, though it has an additional bhakti that is non-metrical and
its devatā is Kumāra Bhavodbhava. Alternatively depending on the prayoga
there is a variant form where the devatā is Skanda-Viśākhau. The mantra
itself goes thus:

sadyojātaṃ prapadyāmi sadyojātāya vai namaḥ \|

bhave-bhave nādibhave bhajasva māṃ bhavodbhava \|\|

I take refuge in the one who had instantly arisen (Sadyojāta). Verily
obeisance to him who has arisen instantly. In existence and after
existence do not partition my share; provide me a share of the ultimate
existence, O one born of Bhava!

This is the core anuṣṭubh to which in regular practice the bhakti:
bhavāya namaḥ \|\| is appended at the end.

There are some key points that you must understand in relation to this
ṛk: Why is Skanda known as Sadyojāta? It relates to him arising
instantly from the semen of Rudra in the Śaravana or Gaṅgā river. The
term is also used for Agni, the father of Skanda, in the ancient Āprī of
the Bhārgava-s:

sadyo jāto vy amimīta yajñam agnir devānām abhavat purogāḥ \|

At birth he instantly measured out the ritual \[space\]; Agni became the
leader of the gods.

This is reminiscent Skanda becoming the leader, i.e. senāni, of the
gods. In the old tradition of the Bhāllavi-s, he is said to have emerged
from Rudra as the dual of Agni to burn down the piśācī when invoked by
Vṛśa Jāna, the badger-like purohita of the Ikṣvāku lord Tryaruṇa. That
is why this ṛk is associated with the mūlamantra of Kumāra: OṂ
vacadbhuve namaḥ \|\| or that of Bodhāyana: OṂ bhuve namaḥ svāha \|\|.
Indeed, one may do japa of the mantra using the following yantra. In the
corners of the central tryaśra-yamala (forming the hexagonal star) one
must place the syllables of one of the above ṣaḍakṣari-s. The in a
circle around the central star one must place the 32 syllables of the
core anuṣṭubh. Then in the central hexagonal hub of the star one must
place the bhakti of 5 syllables. The name of Kumāra, Vacadbhū, is
evidently an old linguistic fossil and indicates the emergence of the
god from the piśacī-repelling incantation.”

PS:“How is the second part of the mantra to be understood?”

Lootika: “The imperative verb bhajasva is to be applied twice once with
the negation particle na and once without it. The na is coupled with the
locative āmreḍita bhave-bhave. When with the negation particle bhava is
understood in more than one way depending on the votary and their
interests. For people of the world, like us, a bhava can be each unit of
conscious existence — it could be each time we get up from sleep and
return to conscious ahaṃ-bhāva. Here the negated verb na bhajasva might
be understood as do not divide what is ours. In the positive sense it is
applied to ādibhava — the primal state or when the consciousness
associated with you is in an identity loop — a state of bliss. For the
yati-s, like the practitioners of the pūrvāṃnāya of yore in the Vaṅga or
the Karṇāṭa country, it implies not being partitioned into multiple
rebirths and being instead given mokṣa (ādibhava).”

Somakhya: “While performing japa you may meditate on the deva mounted on
a peacock with a fowl-banner surrounded by the troops Marut-s bearing
spears, backed by Agni riding a rhinoceros. He is in the midst of a
fierce battle leading the deva-s against the daitya-s and showering
arrows on his foes. Thus one must meditate on him for the destruction of
brahmadviṣ-es and dasyu-s. Alternatively, you may meditate on him in his
dual form as Skanda-Viśākha. In this case one must replace the terminal
bhakti with: namo bhavāya ca śarvāya cobhābhyām akaraṃ namaḥ \|\|. One
may also perform the prayoga where Skanda is visualized as surrounded by
the 12 awful goddesses:

1\) Vimocinī; 2) Mohinī; 3) Sunandā; 4) Pūtanā; 5) Āsurī; 6) Revatī; 7)
Śakunī; 8) Piśācikā; 9) Pāśinī; 10) Mahāmārī; 11) Kālikā; 12) Bhāminī.

Certain traditions holds them to be Paulastyā-s, the 12 sisters of
Rāvaṇa and call it the Rākṣasī-prayoga but we do not subscribe to that.
This may be done for pediatric purposes.

One may also deploy the mantra visualizing Kumāra along with Viśākha,
Śākha, Nejameṣa and Ṣaṣṭhī along with Kauśikī, the daughter Rudra and
Umā. They should be accompanied by the following therocephalic and
avicephalic goddesses who accompany Kauśikī:

1\) Vāyasī, crow-headed; 2) Upakā, owl-headed; 3) Pracaṇḍā, lion-headed;
4) Ugrā, tiger-headed; 5) Jayā, elephant-headed; 6) Jayantī,
peahen-headed; 7) Jayamānā, horse-headed; 8) Prabhā, goose-headed; 9)
Śivā, jackal-headed; 10) Saramā, dog-headed; 11) Vijayā, falcon-headed;
12) Prabhāvatī, sheldrake-headed; 13) Mṛtyu, crane-headed; 14) Niyati,
grebe-headed; 15) Aśani, fowl-headed; 16) Vṛṣadaṃśā, badger-headed; 17)
Śakunī, thrush-headed; 18) Potakī, munia-headed; 19) Vānarī,
monkey-headed.

The following devī-s are visualized with human heads:

20\) Revatī (some say she is cat-headed); 21) Pūtanā; 22) Kaṭapūtanā;
23) Ālambā; 24) Kiṃnarī; 25) Mukhamaṇḍikā; 26) Alakṣmī or Jyeṣthā; 27)
Adhṛtiː 28) Lakṣmī; 29) Spṛhā; 30) Aparājitā.

Along with Ṣaṣṭhī and Kauśikī these constitute the 32 aṛṇa-devī-s of the
Sadyojāta-ṛk and should be worshiped with bīja-s derived from each of
the syllables of the ṛk. The meditation on Kumāra and his emanations
visualized in the midst of these devī-s is the highest sādhanā of his
mantra and may be deployed for Ṣaṭkarmāṇi. This sādhanā may be
accompanied by the use of the ![4 \\times
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pan-diagonal magic square that adds up to 34 comprised of numbers from
1:16 with each representing a pair of the 32 goddesses. Of the sum, 32
are the goddesses that I’ve just mentioned. The remaining 2 are are
Skanda and Ṣaṣṭhī.

``` wp-block-preformatted
```

Now, Pinaki, what śruti-vākya do these goddesses with an avicephalic
emphasis bring to your mind?”

PS:“I’m reminded of the mysterious words of my ancestor Atri Bhauma:

vayaś cana subhva āva yanti

kṣubhā martam anuyataṃ vadhasnaiḥ \|

And like mighty birds \[the Marut-s\] swoop down here, turbulently, to
the mortal pursued by deadly weapons.

They are again compared to birds by Gotama:

vayo na sīdan adhi barhishi priye \|

Like birds \[the Marut-s\] sit down on the dear sacred grass.”

Given the genetic connection of [Skanda and his retinue to the
Marut-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/11/23/the-seven-fold-agni-and-the-seven-fold-troops-of-the-maruts/),
who are said to descend like birds to the sacrificer, I find this
avicephalic emphasis resonant.

Lootika “Good. Indeed, these goddesses accompanying Ṣanmukha are the
precedents of the yoginī-s of kula practice. They reveal themselves to
the sādhaka usually in the form of certain reptiles and mammals. Thus,
you may get the confirmation of your mantra-sādhana with your dūtī
Shallaki by the apparition of yoginī-s in the form of certain birds in
quiet sylvan spots.”

Somakhyaː “To conclude, Lootika will show you how to prepare the
dhatturādi-viṣa for the viṣa-prayoga.”

After Lootika showed him how to prepare the guhyaviṣa from oṣadhi-s, she
said: “The details of these plants are not something you might know
offhand. You can get them from your brother or my sister. In addition to
Skanda, Viśākha, Śākha and Nejameṣa you have to invoke and worship the
32 aṛṇa-devī-s when making the viṣa. When a devadatta is subject this
prayoga he is seized by a dreadful graha and with a crooked look on his
face he wanders yelling and singing: Rudraḥ Skando Viśākho .aham Indro
.aham \| even as old Vagbhaṭa has described the graha seizure. Such a
seizure could also happen due to other reasons by agents of Kumāra such
as the ovine sprite or the caprine sprite or the Āpastamba sprite. It
could also happen among the ritually weak when they visit Lankā,
Mālādvīpa or Kāshmīra where various piśāca-graha-s naturally reside. The
seizure often manifests differently among males and females. In females
it might manifest as the state of pinning for ones lover as the old
Drāviḍa-s would say. In such cases one may deploy this mantra with the
visualization of Kumāra with the Mātṛ-s. One also worships them when
goes to the holy spots specially to around Eurasia.”

PS: “Indeed, I heard from Shallaki of such a seizure of one of her
relatives when he visited Kāshmīra. My brother informs me of the
Kaubera-vrata-s that need to be performed in Kāshmīra to invoke
Kaubera-piśāca-s to counter seizures.”

Somakhyaː“Thus, go ahead an practice this mantra. Sleep on the ground,
avoid eating sweets and drinking sweet beverages, and sitting on
cushions. Now you should conclude by performing the tarpaṇa as
promulgated by Bodhāyana”:

OṂ skandaṃ tarpayāmi \| Om indraṃ tarpayāmi \| OṂ ṣaṣṭhīṃ tarpayāmi \|
ṣaṇmukhaṃ tarpayāmi \| OṂ jayantaṃ tarpayāmi \| OṂ viśākhaṃ tarpayāmi \|
OṂ mahāsenaṃ tarpayāmi \| OṂ subrahmaṇyaṃ tarpayāmi \| OṂ
skanda-pārṣadāṃs tarpayāmi \| OṂ skanda-pārṣadīś ca tarpayāmi \|\|

Studying mathematics with our father was not exactly an easy-going
experience; nevertheless, it was the source of many a spark that
inspired fruitful explorations and life-lessons. We recount one such
thread here, and reflect on how our personal education matched up to
history. When we were a kid, and learning about the area and perimeter
of plane figures — we used to do it with a graph paper — our father told
us that
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was not
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as our school lessons claimed but a “never-ending” number. He pointed to
us that
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was just like
![\\frac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which repeated after a certain run of numbers. This inculcated in us a
life-long fascination, to the degree our meager mathematical capacity
allowed, for both these types of numbers and their deeper significance.
Some time thereafter our parents took us to watch a series of
documentaries that were screened at a nearby auditorium on the evolution
of man and various intellectual developments in science and mathematics
in the Occident. In one of them, the presenter mentioned that the
yavanācārya of yore, Archimedes, had arrived at the approximation
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by inscribing polygons in a circle. This sparked a great a excitement in
us for we were then fascinated by construction of regular polygons
![(\\mathcal{P}\_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
On returning home from the screening, we quickly got back to that
geometric activity realizing that the very first construction we learned
in life, that of a regular hexagon, yielded ![\\pi \\approx
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1).

![Figure 1. Construction of a regular hexagon (polygon

in a unit
circle.](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/limit_pi.png?w=811)

That was hardly anything to write home about, but even as people used to
think that “developmental ontology recapitulates phylogeny”, this
realization recapitulated the very beginnings of the human knowledge of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This value was used for the crudest of constructions in the Vedic ritual
going back to its ancient roots. It has been suggested that this
knowledge is encapsulated in a cryptic manner with a peculiar play on
the name of the god Trita (meaning 3rd):

indro yad vajrī dhṛṣamāṇo andhasā bhinad valasya paridhīṃr iva tritaḥ \|

When the vajra-wielding Indra invigorated by the soma draught, split the
\[fortification\] perimeter of Vala (the dānava’s name is used in a
possible play on term for a circle), even as Trita \[had done\].

The allusion to the god Trita in the simile here is unusual and is
evidently an allusion to his breaking out a well (an enclosure with a
circular section); this strengthens the idea that a word play on the
circular perimeter being split up in 3 by the diameter was exploited by
Savya Āṅgirasa. This crude approximation continued to be used in
sthūla-vyavahāra by the Hindus and the Nirgrantha-s till the medieval
period (e.g. in the nagna text Tiloyasāra: vāso tiguṇo parihi \|; the
Prakrit corresponds to the Sanskrit vyāso triguṇaḥ paridhiḥ \|:
![P(\\bigcirc)=
3d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28%5Cbigcirc%29%3D+3d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
). We also hear that the Jews used the same value in building a
religious structure in their early history. While that is a lot of words
to expend on this crudest of approximations, one could say that it at
least gets you to
![95.5\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=95.5%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the real thing. Around that time our father had introduced us to the
radian measure of an angle and informed us that it was the natural one,
for after all the number 360 for the degree measure was an arbitrary one
coming from an approximation of the year. This most elementary of
constructions, the hexagon, gave us an indelible visual feel for the
radian for after all if 3 got us to
![95.5\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=95.5%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the radian should be roughly
![57.3^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=57.3%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
More importantly, it informed us that this unit is best understood in
multiples of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and that the interior angle of the hexagon should be
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In terms of history we had caught up with the emergence of the germ of
this concept in Āryabhaṭa.

![Figure 2. A regular dodecagon from a square and equilateral
triangles](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/dodecagon_area.png?w=1024)

The aftermath of the above apprehension led us to doing a few more
constructions and origami folding that led us to a somewhat more
interesting realization from an aesthetically pleasing construction of a
regular dodecagon which goes thus (Figure 2):

1\) Draw a starting square and an equilateral triangle facing inwards on
each of its sides (relates to the basic origami construction of an
equilateral triangle from a square paper as indicated by Sundara Rao
more than 100 years ago).

2\) The inward-facing vertices of these equilateral triangles will
define a new square orthogonal to the original square.

3\) The 4 midpoints of the sides of this new square and the
intersections of the equilateral triangles help define the sides of a
regular dodecagon — in effect arising from a geometric multiplication of
![4 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, this dodecagon is inscribed in the inner square.

4\) Notably, this construction by itself helps define two tiles, a
![150^\\circ-15^\\circ-15^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=150%5E%5Ccirc-15%5E%5Ccirc-15%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
isosceles triangle
![T_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(violet) and an equilateral triangle
![T_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(green). Using these tiles both the inner square
![(\\mathcal{P}\_4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the dodecagon
![(\\mathcal{P}\_{12})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_%7B12%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be completely tiled thus (Figure 2):
![\\mathcal{P}\_4=32T_1+16T_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_4%3D32T_1%2B16T_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\mathcal{P}\_{12}=24T_1+12T_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_%7B12%7D%3D24T_1%2B12T_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This means that the area of the inscribed dodecagon is
![\\tfrac{3}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the area of the inner square.

5\) A corollary to the above is that if a unit circle were inscribed in
the inner square then square will have area 4 and the dodecagon will
have area 3.

Thus, it indicated that we would need a polygon of twice the number of
sides to get the same approximation of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
via its area as that of an inscribed polygon which gives the same from
its perimeter. Hence, perimeter of the inscribed polygon is better than
the area to obtain an approximation of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, these exercises taught us something notable: If the Yajurvedic
tradition had used polygon inscription (likely it did not) then it would
have required a decagon to get something close to its values ![\\approx
3.09;
98.4\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+3.09%3B+98.4%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the real value. While Baudhāyana or Kātyāyana are not explicit about it,
Āpastamba is clear that these ![\\bigcirc \\leftrightarrow
\\square](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbigcirc+%5Cleftrightarrow+%5Csquare&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
conversions are approximate. Squeezing out additional digits beyond that
point is a process of diminishing returns; however, in the ancient world
the Maitrāyaṇīya school of the Ādhvaryava tradition and the Egyptians
achieved similar success reaching close to
![99.4..99.5\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=99.4..99.5%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the real value. If one wanted to achieve such a level of
approximation with the polygon method you would need to inscribe
![\\mathcal{P}\_{18}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_%7B18%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get almost exactly the value of the Maitrāyaṇīya tradition. While old
Archimedes is said to have labored with a 96-side polygon to reach his
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
Āryabhaṭa would have needed something like 360-polygon to get his value.
This made us suspect that it was unlikely he used polygon inscription
and instead had a trick inherited from the non-polygonal methods typical
of the old Hindu quadrature of the circle \[Footnote 1\]. On the other
hand Archimedes’ early triumph undoubtedly rode on the quadrature of the
circle achieved by the Platonic school.

From our father’s instruction we were reasonably conversant with basic
trigonometry before it had been taught in school and he used that as
base to introduce us to the basics of calculus in the form of limits. He
told us that we could use our polygon inscription to informally
understand the limit ![\\lim\_{x \\to 0}
\\tfrac{\\sin(x)}{x}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clim_%7Bx+%5Cto+0%7D+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csin%28x%29%7D%7Bx%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With this in hand, he told us that we could, if we really understood it,
prove the formulae of the perimeter and area of a circle as the limiting
case of the
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-sided
polygon. From our earliest education in mensuration we had been puzzled
by how that mysterious number
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
appeared in these formulae — we understood quite easily how the formulae
of rectilinear figures like rectangles and triangles had been derived
but this “correction factor” for the circle had been an open question
for us. Hence, we were keen to figure this out using our newly acquired
knowledge of limits. Being of only modest mathematical ability it took
us a few days until we arrived at the proof with limits but we were then
satisfied beyond words by the experience of putting down the below:

![Figure 3. The circle as the limit of an inscribed
polygon](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/limit_pi2.png?w=1024)

From Figure 3 we can write the perimeter of an inscribed polygon in a
unit circle as:

![P(\\mathcal{P}\_n)=2n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = 2 \\pi
\\dfrac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)
}{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_n%29%3D2n%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+2+%5Cpi+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29+%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Similarly we can write its area as:

![A(\\mathcal{P}\_n)=n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)
= \\pi \\dfrac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) }{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}
\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_n%29%3Dn%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cpi+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29+%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%7D+%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![n \\to \\infty \\; \\tfrac{\\pi}{n} \\to 0 \\therefore \\displaystyle
\\lim\_{\\tfrac{\\pi}{n} \\to 0}
\\dfrac{\\sin\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}{\\tfrac{\\pi}{n}} \\to

By taking the above limit we get
![P(\\mathcal{P}\_\\infty)=P(\\bigcirc)=2\\pi;
\\;A(\\mathcal{P}\_\\infty)=A(\\bigcirc)=\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_%5Cinfty%29%3DP%28%5Cbigcirc%29%3D2%5Cpi%3B+%5C%3BA%28%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D_%5Cinfty%29%3DA%28%5Cbigcirc%29%3D%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

While this gave us the formulae for the perimeter and the area of a
circle, the actual value of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was still a challenge and progress on that front had to wait for other
developments. Around the same time, our fascination with the other
conics was growing, mainly as an offshoot of our concomitant interest in
astronomy. Armed with the high-precision German-made templates we had
received from our father we began studying these conics closely. We soon
realized that the circle was at one end of the continuum of ellipses and
the parabola the end. The hyperbolae lay beyond that end almost as if
the ellipse had wrapped around infinity and its two apices had folded
back towards each other. It also struck us right away that the method of
limits we had used to derive the area and perimeter of a circle could
not applied to these other conics. Informally (i.e. by squeezing a
circle perpendicular to one of the diameters while preserving area), we
could figure out that the area of an ellipse should be ![\\pi a
b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+a+b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where ![a,
b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are its semimajor and semiminor axes. We also got the idea of “area
under a curve” intuitively; however, it was unclear how the formulae for
perimeters of these other conics could be derived. We had seen formulae
for them in tables of functions we had at home \[Footnote 2\]. However,
the tables stated that the multiple formulae it offered perimeter of the
ellipse
![P(E)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28E%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
were approximate:

![P(E) \\approx 2 \\pi
\\sqrt{ab}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28E%29+%5Capprox+2+%5Cpi+%5Csqrt%7Bab%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![P(E) \\approx \\pi
(a+b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28E%29+%5Capprox+%5Cpi+%28a%2Bb%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![P(E) \\approx
\\pi\\sqrt{2(a^2+b^2)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28E%29+%5Capprox+%5Cpi%5Csqrt%7B2%28a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The first two formulae were attributed in the tables to Johannes Kepler,
who had reason to calculate this as he studied ellipses in course of his
monumental work on planetary orbits. While I have confirmed him as the
source of the first formula, it is not clear if he was the first to
propose the second one. The third formula was proposed by Leonhard
Euler. In Hindu tradition, to our knowledge, the perimeter of an ellipse
(āyata-vṛtta) was treated for the first time by Mahāvīra in this
Gaṇita-sāra-saṃgraha. He gives a formula that goes thus:

vyasa-krtiḥ ṣadguṇitā dvi-saṅ-guṇāyama-krtiyutā padam paridhiḥ \|

vyāsa-catur-bhāga-guṇaś cāyata-vṛttasya sukṣma-phalam \|\|

Six times the square of the minor axis plus the square of twice its
major axis; the root of this gives the perimeter. That multiplied by one
fourth of its minor axis is the high precision area of the ellipse.

In modern usage the perimeter will be: ![P(E) \\approx
2\\sqrt{4a^2+6b^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28E%29+%5Capprox+2%5Csqrt%7B4a%5E2%2B6b%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Eratosthenes, the preeminent yavana philosopher of early Ptolemaic Egypt
\[footnote 1\], composed a hymn to the god Hermes of which only some
fragments have come down to us. This connection to Hermes is evidently
related to his Egyptian locus, where the old ritual-experts saw all
manner of clever inventions and ritual ordinances as being set down by
their god Thoth, who was syncretized with Hermes of the yavana
conquerors of Egypt. In this hymn, Eratosthenes describes Hermes as
looking down on universe from the highest sphere of heaven
(![\\sim](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Ārya parame vyoman \[footnote 2\]. As he did so, Hermes is mentioned as
perceiving the harmony of the spheres of the planets and the world axis
passing through the earth in the center. Eratosthenes represented these
harmonies in the form of the lyre that was invented by the god Hermes
and gifted to the god Apollo. Eratosthenes, held that while surveying
the universe from the highest sphere, Hermes saw that the “harmony of
the spheres” was the same as the harmony of his lyre. This equivalence
of the harmonies was seen by these yavanācarya-s as illustrating the
desmos (equivalent of Ārya saṃbandha: the common thread, bindings,
equivalences) that runs across different branches of mathematics (noted
by Friedrich Solmsen who brought to light the religious background of
Eratosthenes, something that is ignored by those who wish to paint him
in the image of a modern “scientist” of the Occident ). Indeed, similar
“harmonies” were perceived by the yavana sage Pythagoras and before him
in the form of the numerical sambandha-s of the Ārya-s of the Yajurveda
— such mysterious numerical patterns and conjunctions bring together
apparent disparate branches of mathematics.

Keeping with the god with whom he had a special connection, Eratosthenes
was the inventive kind, who, while a Platonist (made clear by the sage
Iamblichus), was somewhat unlike those of the pure geometric school — he
described to king Ptolemaios a method of doubling the Delian altar of
Apollo with a machine rather than the geometric constructions of Eudoxus
(believed to be divinely inspired) using the curve known as the kampyle
![(y^{2}=\\tfrac{x^{4}}{a^{2}}-x^{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y%5E%7B2%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E%7B4%7D%7D%7Ba%5E%7B2%7D%7D-x%5E%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or the conics used by Plato’s associates Menaechmus and Dinostratus.
Likewise, he was more like the Ārya-s in his algorithmic methods
pertaining to numbers — perhaps most famously the sieve for prime
numbers is attributed to him. We had the experience of such a sambandha
while exploring the prime sieve and its generalizations.

The prime sieve is a simple but powerful algorithm for extracting the
sequence of prime numbers
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that one might have learned in elementary school. While a product of the
ancient world, its power is best appreciated in the modern computer age
and is recommended to students as one of the first computer programs to
write. In its modern form it goes thus (the ancient yavana concept of
numbers was geometric and not exactly the same as we might take it be):

• Write out the sequence of integers ![2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6%2C+7%2C+8%2C+9%2C+10%2C+11%2C+12%2C+13%2C+14%2C+15%2C+16%2C+17%2C+18%2C+19%2C+20%2C+21+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

• Move the first integer in this sequence to sequence
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and kill all its multiples from the above sequence (circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-9.png?w=1024)

• This yields a new sequence: ![3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+5%2C+7%2C+9%2C+11%2C+13%2C+15%2C+17%2C+19%2C+21+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Again move the first term of this sequence to sequence
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and kill its multiples in this sequence (circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-2.png?w=650)

• Repeat this procedure with ![5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5%2C+7%2C+11%2C+13%2C+17%2C+19+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for as many cycles as required. Thus, you get the sequence of prime
numbers ![p: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3A+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+7%2C+11%2C+13%2C+17%2C+19+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Millennia after Eratosthenes, in the 1950s, Jabotinsky generalized this
sieve algorithm to generate other notable sequences. The first of these
goes thus:

• Write out the sequence of integers ![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6%2C+7%2C+8%2C+9%2C+10%2C+11%2C+12%2C+13%2C+14%2C+15%2C+16%2C+17%2C+18%2C+19%2C+20%2C+21+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

• Move the first integer in this sequence to sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and kill all integers by jumping by a skip of size equal to that first
integer, starting from that first integer of the above sequence
(circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-3.png?w=1024)

• This yields a new sequence: ![2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C+4%2C+6%2C+8%2C+10%2C+12%2C+14%2C+16%2C+18%2C+20+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Again move the first term of this sequence to sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and kill all integers by jumping with a skip equal to the new first
integer starting from it (circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-10.png?w=595)

• This yields a new sequence: ![4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 28, 30,
34, 36, 40
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%2C+6%2C+10%2C+12%2C+16%2C+18%2C+22%2C+24%2C+28%2C+30%2C+34%2C+36%2C+40+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We illustrate the next few steps below:

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-5.png?w=1024)

• Thus, the above sieve yields the sequence

![a=1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 22, 24, 28, 36, 40, 42, 46, 52, 60, 66, 70,
76, 82
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%2C+2%2C+4%2C+6%2C+10%2C+12%2C+16%2C+22%2C+24%2C+28%2C+36%2C+40%2C+42%2C+46%2C+52%2C+60%2C+66%2C+70%2C+76%2C+82+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The form of the sequence originally published by Erdős and Jabotinsky is
the above sequence plus 1 (Sometimes called Ludic numbers). i.e.:

![2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 25, 29, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+7%2C+11%2C+13%2C+17%2C+23%2C+25%2C+29%2C+37%2C+41%2C+43%2C+47%2C+53+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This sequence can also be generated by applying a sieve just as above
starting with an initial sequence ![2, 3, 4, 5, 6
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and killing integers with a skip of size equal to first term of the
intermediate sequence minus 1. As one can see, this version of the
sequence includes certain primes and certain odd numbers which are not
primes (e.g. 25, 77, 91, 115, 119, 121, 143, 161, 175 …).

We know that prime number sequence
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a scaling which can be asymptotically represented by ![p\[n\] \\sim
n\\log(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5Bn%5D+%5Csim+n%5Clog%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now we can ask how does this sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
generated by the generalized sieve scale (Figure 1)?

![Figure 1. Scaling of sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/jaber1.png?w=1024)

We see that
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grows more rapidly than
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1, black line) though it must be asymptotic to the latter. Thus,
there must be additional terms to get a better asymptotic fit than
![n\\log(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Clog%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1, gray line). Figure 1 shows at till the term 10000
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lies between:

![n\\log(n)+\\tfrac{1}{2}n(\\log(\\log(n)))^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Clog%28n%29%2B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dn%28%5Clog%28%5Clog%28n%29%29%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(brown dotted line) and

![n\\log(n)+\\tfrac{1}{2}n(\\log(\\log(n)))^2 +
(2-\\gamma)n\\log(\\log(n))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Clog%28n%29%2B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dn%28%5Clog%28%5Clog%28n%29%29%29%5E2+%2B+%282-%5Cgamma%29n%5Clog%28%5Clog%28n%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(brown solid line),

where ![\\gamma = -\\textrm{di}\\gamma(1) \\approx
0.5772157](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+-%5Ctextrm%7Bdi%7D%5Cgamma%281%29+%5Capprox+0.5772157&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is Euler’s constant.

Erdős and Jabotinsky have shown that for large
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the growth of sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
exceeds the above higher bound by a further correction term.

We can generate another related sequence by a similar sieve where we
kill the terms by skipping over ![2
\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the value first term. This results in the sequence

![b: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 33, 35, 38,
41, 44
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3A+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+6%2C+8%2C+11%2C+12%2C+14%2C+18%2C+20%2C+21%2C+23%2C+26%2C+30%2C+33%2C+35%2C+38%2C+41%2C+44+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Unlike the sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it includes both odd and even numbers and one notices that
![b\[n\]=\\tfrac{a\[n\]}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5Bn%5D%3D%5Ctfrac%7Ba%5Bn%5D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
starting from the term
![a\[2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5B2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

As one can see it scales at half rate of the sequence
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, this type of generalized sieve reveals that sequences arising from
a process, where the skip is dependent on the first term of the
intermediate sequence, are asymptotic with a function whose base term is
of the form ![a_n \\sim k
n\\log(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_n+%5Csim+k+n%5Clog%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a constant. One may say that of these the one which yields the primes
is some kind of an optimal sieve that lets neither too few nor two many
numbers pass through it. Thus, intuitively, the primes can be seen as an
inherent optimal path through the number world.

The next type of sieve of Jabotinsky is operated thus:

• Write out the sequence of integers ![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6%2C+7%2C+8%2C+9%2C+10%2C+11%2C+12%2C+13%2C+14%2C+15%2C+16%2C+17%2C+18%2C+19%2C+20%2C+21+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

• Move the first integer in this sequence to sequence
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and kill all integers by jumping by a skip of size 1 starting from the
first integer of the above sequence (circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-8.png?w=1024)

• This yields a new sequence: ![2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22,
24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C+4%2C+6%2C+8%2C+10%2C+12%2C+14%2C+16%2C+18%2C+20%2C+22%2C+24%2C+26%2C+28%2C+30%2C+32%2C+34%2C+36%2C+38%2C+40+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Now we operate on this sequence by sending the first term to sequence
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and starting from it killing all terms by jump with a skip of 2
(circled):

![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/image-7.png?w=1024)

• This yields a new sequence: ![4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 28, 30,
34, 36, 40, 42, 46, 48, 52, 54
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%2C+6%2C+10%2C+12%2C+16%2C+18%2C+22%2C+24%2C+28%2C+30%2C+34%2C+36%2C+40%2C+42%2C+46%2C+48%2C+52%2C+54+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
We repeat the above procedure, killing terms in each iteration with
skips of 3, 4, 5… As a result we get the sequence:

![f: 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 18, 22, 30, 34, 42, 48
\\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+1%2C+2%2C+4%2C+6%2C+10%2C+12%2C+18%2C+22%2C+30%2C+34%2C+42%2C+48+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This sequence relates to a function on positive integers
![\\textrm{jab}(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bjab%7D%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
we illustrate this function by the example of
![\\textrm{jab}(8)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bjab%7D%288%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

• We take 8 and reduce it by 1 to get 7.

• We then get the lowest multiple of 7 that is greater than 8
![\\rightarrow
14](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+14&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

• We then reduce 7 by 1 ![\\rightarrow
6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and obtain lowest multiple of 6 that is greater than 14 ![\\rightarrow
18](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+18&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

• We continue this procedure till the successive reduction ends in 1.
The corresponding sequence of their multiples is:

![8 \\rightarrow 14 \\rightarrow 18 \\rightarrow 20 \\rightarrow 20
\\rightarrow 21 \\rightarrow 22 \\rightarrow
22](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8+%5Crightarrow+14+%5Crightarrow+18+%5Crightarrow+20+%5Crightarrow+20+%5Crightarrow+21+%5Crightarrow+22+%5Crightarrow+22&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

• Thus, we get
![\\textrm{jab}(8)=22](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bjab%7D%288%29%3D22&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Remarkably, it turns out that
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the sequence of
![\\textrm{jab}(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bjab%7D%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

![Figure 2. Scaling of sequence
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/jaber2.png?w=1024)

Even more remarkably, ![f\[n\] =
\\tfrac{n^2}{\\pi}+c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D%2Bc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
where
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a correction term. Erdős and Jabotinsky showed that
![c=\\mathcal{O}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the big
![\\mathcal{O}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
notation. For relatively small
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can safely write ![f\[n\] \\approx
\\tfrac{n^2}{\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D+%5Capprox+%5Ctfrac%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. a parabolic scaling with
![\\tfrac{1}{\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the coefficient (brown line in Figure 2). Thus, the generalized
sieving procedure yields a sequence that provides a mysterious “desmos”
to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yet again linking disparate branches of mathematics. More generally, it
points that beneath these branches lie relatively simply computational
processes such as the sieve, whose original form was attributed to
Eratosthenes, which yields a variety of entities organically, like prime
numbers or
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Finally, this parabolic scaling with
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the constant also brings to mind an interesting iterative generator
of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
apparently first discovered by Cloitre:

• Initiate two maps with the terms
![x_1=y_1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3Dy_1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

•

and
![y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scales as

addresses him as philosophías proestō̃ta

Footnote 2: This evidently derives from an old IE tradition as one can
also compare it with the phrase used for the cognate deity Pūṣaṇ:
saṃcakṣāṇo bhuvanā deva īyate by the Aṅgiras, Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya, in
RV 6.58.2. In Greek world, there were two evolutes descending from the
Proto-Indo-European cognate of Pūṣaṇ: Hermes and Pan

Just this morning our brother remarked that the fear of the virus has
inverted this month with respect to the actual infection. We literally
hear this: in the past few months, while home-bound, we at least had
aural quietness for most of the day, something we generally prefer.
Since the lock-down was lifted in our regions over the past two days we
hear the loud blaring of music from the restaurant next door even as
diners flock to it in throngs. We can only see those seated outside and
do not know if any are seated inside. If it is only the former, it is a
lesser evil, but the music is any case an annoyance for the still
home-bound residents. A walk to the deśi grocery store revealed a
similar situation on the street and with other restaurants. Masks,
social distancing and the like are mostly breaking down. Most diners and
ramblers are young individuals who clearly know that they are at lower
risk but the danger they have inflicted on the rest of society, if any,
will be known over this month. However, there are much bigger things
than that are happening.

Humans are social animals and we have been wondering how the lock-down
and social distancing was going to spill over into the psychological
domain. Right from the early stages of the pandemic when it was still
mostly confined to the Cīna-s, we heard reports of the psychological
impact of being cooped up at home. The Americans, in particular, are a
very outdoor people, especially with summer making its advent. Hence,
the spring lock-down has clearly had a negative effect on their psyche
and over the last two weeks it has exploded in the form of an extensive
jana-kopa. With the jana-kopa unfolding, the political players seeking
to take advantage of it have decided to throw social distancing to the
winds and we are now witnessing massive congregations of people.
Earlier, the politicians of the opposite pakṣa were mainly the ones
against lock-downs. Ironically, the politicians cheering for the current
congregations are the very ones who were in favor of social distancing
and strong lock-downs until two weeks ago. The virus, of course, does
not care for the whims of either pakṣa, and what is unfolding might end
up teaching us some important epidemiological lessons: how much does
mass social aggregation outdoors really contribute to viral spread?
However, that might be conflated with other factors like the end of the
lock-down and consequent social aggregation we mentioned above.

The flash-point for this jana-kopa were a set of incidents relating to
the well-known and long-standing racial conflict which is baked into the
foundation of the USA. However, that is not the primary topic of our
discussion here. We primarily intend to touch upon how an outbreak of a
memetic viral pandemic rapidly overtook the original cause for the
flash-point of the jana-kopa. Here, we are seeing a pratyakṣa of how a
real viral infection interacts with a memetic pathogen, much like how a
viral infection could facilitate in a secondary bacterial infection in
biological pathology.

Before we look at that, we need to have quick survey of the lay of land
that facilitates the spread of the latest strain of the memetic
infection. As we have noted before, the world has come a long way from
the sārthavāha-s of yore who even when wide-ranging did not disrupt the
local systems. For instance, in say the Marahaṭṭā country, where we
formerly lived, there was the system of the bārā balutedāra-s which has
perhaps lasted in some form from the pre-Āryan days of the Harappan
civilization. This system comprised of 12 jāti-s who offered essential
services for a village. These spanned the entire range from the jāti-s
with a low social rank to those with a large component of steppe
ancestry and old Āryan descent who were high-ranked. Irrespective of the
real or imagined the local issues rising from inter-jāti conflicts,
these still for most part worked as a rather cohesive unit for probably
at least 1400 years. The sārthavāha operated on top of this system and
bore produce across the country and beyond. However, such vaṇij-s did
not do anything to interfere disruptively with the system in the
villages. The modern sārthavāha built by the stock market or the
internet is mostly a contrasting species. It is clear they have greater
reach and rapacity than the old sārthavāha-s but they are also prone to
more evil. There is an entire spectrum of the balance of evil they cause
to the utility they provide to society. The self-enriching
mithyā-kraya-kartṛ Sora has absolutely nothing useful to offer to the
world and a purely evil player. The vyāpārin Bejha offers several useful
services for the jana-samudāya but has leveraged the wealth he has
accumulated in the process to do evil. Among the corporations,
karṇa-piśācī guggulu might offer some small services of use to the
populace but has used its capture of an important resource to further
evil. A similar situation is seen with the duṣṭa, Jāka the dāraka: he
offers a platform for online advertisement and conversation but has used
it to further evil causes and contribute to the demise of freedom of
expression. Probably, Mukhagiri also falls in the same category as Jāka
the dāraka.

Why are these modern mleccha and mūlavātūla sārthavāha-s such duṣṭa-s?
We posit that it has two parts to it: 1) They are to a degree conscious
that their rapacious actions cause a measure of harm to individuals and
the emergent entity known as society which they comprise. Moreover, in
the past the mleccha and mūla-rugṇa sārthavāha-s used to practice what
came to be known as capitalism in an unbridled way and they saw that it
acquired a bad name. So there has been some urge in the midst of at
least some of them to perform a bit of parihāra. Like all humans they
too subliminally subscribe to the view that they can gain compensatory
puṇya by performing acts in support of religion. In the past, the
sārthavāha-s in our midst too, keen to acquire puṇya, used to make
donations to various deva-prāsāda-s or build new ones themselves (or
pāṣaṇdālaya-s). 2) The original ekarākṣasonmāda-s had a single rakṣas as
the object of their worship. They took the jabberings of their unmatta-s
— much like one seized by a rākṣasa-graha — to be the very words of this
rakṣas and as the basis of their impious systems. Closer to our times,
starting with durātman-s Marx and Engels, there arose among the
mleccha-s and the ādipraiṣhaka-s a mutation of the old unmāda-s where
the rakṣas count was reduced from 1 to 0. However, as we have noted
before, the rest of the unmāda, such as the promise of a utopia on earth
or in Lalaland remained intact. This version of the unmāda is now the
ascendant religion among the employees of or of these very sārthavāha-s
themselves. Thus, what has happened is that they seek to earn puṇya by
granting endowments for this new abrahma-ruj.

Even if one were not infected fully by this secular mutation of the old
unmāda-s, among the lay mleccha-s there is a certain naive econolatory:
they worship the faceless market running by its own vrata-s and
attribute all human abhyudaya to these magical market forces. They see
it as self-correcting and the panacea for all evil — whereas in the past
they used see the prathama and dvitīya unmāda-s as the foundation of
their well-being they now either additionally or exclusively genuflect
towards the miraculous market. In this worship of the market, especially
given that it is faceless, its purveyors, the vaṇij, naturally become
important idols in society. Now in itself this might have not been
specially negative with the vaṇij were dharma-kartṛ-s. However, as we
saw above a significant fraction of the mleccha and ādi-rugṇa vaṇij-s
have been infected by the caturthonmāda. As a consequence, these idols
of society are not purveying the neutral capitalism that the mleccha
elite worship but a new unmāda. This, along with their global reach, has
allowed that unmāda to attain pandemic proportions.

One may ask had it not already done so already in the heydays of the
Soviets and Mao, leaking over to India as the Naxal rudhironmāda? Yes,
it had but there are important distinctions with respect to the current
strain. First, the old strain was very much dependent on the Soviet
continuation of the old Rus empire. Once that fell, it was like a
chariot that had lost a wheel. While it briefly infected the Cīna-s,
what people do not get is that it was domesticated to the ultimate
advantage of the Cīna-s as it encountered an even more potent endogenous
coopter in the form Wei Yang Lord Shang’s legalism. Thus, the old strain
was mostly a failure. However, a lineage of it survived in mleccha
academia where it was incubated in the Ivy League soft departments and
their more pedestrian arborizations as a local disease, much like a
virus jumping from animal to animal in a Cīna “wet-market”. Like SARS-1
it has had localized outbreaks and was mostly used a weapon by mleccha-s
against others like the Hindus — e.g. to reinvigorate the Naxals in the
form of their urban variant (“the urban Naxals” as a Bollywood producer
terms it). Its local outbreaks were mostly seen in the mleccha academia
and news media. A few years ago we heard of a left-leaning professor
couple being forced out of a mleccha liberal arts college by a
particularly sustained outbreak of this disease. Some other, otherwise
rather neutral and harmless, mleccha physicians/professors were also
seriously targeted but being part of the Ivy elite themselves they
suffered little from the attacks. Similarly, there was a mlecchikā who
used to originally think of the rākṣasonmāda as a great blessing on
humanity. However, as it happens with that disease, when you get too
close to it you get the full blast of its stench. Thus, she suffered an
incident of rākṣasa-juṣṭi and suddenly saw light the truly hard way.
That also opened her eyes to the caturthonmāda and immediately brought
her under attack from those infected by it. Thus, those who were
observant and discerning knew that this extremely dangerous mānasika-ruj
was just waiting to jump out into the wider population like a viral
pandemic.

Rather notably, the jana-kopa triggered by the kṛṣṇa-mleccha-saṃgrāma in
big mleccha-land along with the psychological and economic fallout of
the Wuhan disease finally allowed this unmāda to break out as a pandemic
itself – indeed we see it catching fire across the mleccha world. Like
the Wuhan corruption it might eventually hit Bhārata too. Already it was
used by the duṣṭa Sora against Bhārata in conjunction with the
marūnmatta-s in the recent past. A part of the urban Bhārata elite are
nothing other than mleccha-s with an asita-tvak; hence, they would get
similarly afflicted by the disease. Like all the prior abrahma-ruj-s,
this latest strain retains its inherent hate for dharma and theoclasm.
Hence, the Hindu elite will need to become aware of this dangerous
disease and not be fooled by the subterfuge it practices of hiding
beneath other causes of jana-kopa. One thing that will show its face to
Hindus will be its collaboration with marūnmāda and its śanti-dūta-s and
pretonmāda and its prema-dūta-s in Bhārata.

While abrahma-ruj-s are of the mānasika kind they have some of the same
behaviors and consequences as a jivaruj. One might think that one is
cured of it but it might have merely has mutated in the infected
person’s mind and persist as a different version of the disease even as
persistent bacterial infection. As an example, we have a TSPian
ex-marūnmattikā, who is popular in mleccha secular circles and even
supported by Hindus, who exhibits the same hate for H as a full-blown
marūnmatta. Dick Dawkins is another example of the same. Here, the
disease has assumed a new persistent form while superficially appearing
as though cured. Even if one is truly cured of an abrahma-ruj one can
have a lifelong chronic inflammatory condition — this is seen among some
mleccha atheists and neo-heathens. That inflammatory condition can be
seen in the form of destructive dur-vāsana-s persisting among them.
Given this background, our general prognosis is that we are not going to
see the mleccha-s especially the mahā-mleccha come out of this. It might
not be this incident per say but this might be one in a series of many
that will eventually result in the decline and perhaps even demise of
the mahā-mleccha. The only lucky thing for them is that they have no
challengers right now who could exploit it well enough to give them the
coup de grace.

So what might play out? Given that the current strain is still an unmāda
it will compete vigorously with other unmāda-s for its host. Since, none
of these unmāda-s kill the host the battle is not going to lead to
attenuation in anyway. Finally, the second amendment of the mahāmleccha
constitution and those who know how to make use of it will be the last
line of defense for the pretonmāda. So these and the those infected by
the new strain will clash. The former have the advantage of fecundity
while the latter of propaganda and the economic backing from the
converted vyāpārin-s. The biological virus is still not done and could
still stir the mix. At this stage even though the new strain will
clearly win in the urban centers it is not going to yet take the rural
lands. We do not know if that failure would allow it to gain a total
victory. In any case we can say that already a covert war between two
unmāda-s, like the crusade and the jihād, is under way among the
maha-mleccha. In Europe the fourth strain will win and in turn it would
likely face defeat at the hands of the more vigorous marūnmāda.
Marūnmāda’s foothold in mahāmleccha is still weak; hence, while they
will take the side of the 4th strain the basic resolution of the war
remains unclear. Whoever wins, the mahāmleccha will be weakened as a
whole. But from a Hindu perspective, the pakṣas locked in yuddha among
the mlecchas will just be like being offered a choice between the evil
Qarmathians and the monstrous Ghaznavids.

In our youth as a consequence of our undying fascination with ovals we
explored many means of generating them. In course of those explorations
we experimentally arrived at a simple second order differential equation
that generated oval patterns. It also taught us lessons on chaotic
systems emerging from differential equations even before we actually
explored the famous Lorenz and Rossler attractors for ourselves. The
inspiration came from the very well-known harmonic oscillator which is
one of the first differential equations you might study as a layperson:
![\\tfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-ax](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bd%5E2x%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D%3D-ax&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a positive constant that has some direct meaning in physics as the
ratio of the restoration constant to the mass of the oscillator. With
this foundation, we wondered what might happen if we used a cubic term
instead which was in turn coupled to a periodic forcing from a regular
harmonic oscillator. Thus, we arrived at the below equation with 3
parameters ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![\\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-abx^3+a\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi t}{c}\\right)

It became obvious to us this equation has no solution in terms of
elementary functions but we could semi-intuitively figure out that
solutions are likely to generate oval-like figures. To test this out we
had actually solve it numerically. Just before this foray, a visiting
relative, who was a college teacher, mentioned to us that the mark of
man was to solve ordinary differential equations using the method of
Rangā and Kuṭṭi on hand-held calculator. We had learned Euler’s method
as a part of our education in basic numerical calculus but the this new
method, apparently discovered by these south Indian savants, was
something we had never heard of. Accordingly, we looked up a book
featuring numerical analysis, which our father often recommended to us,
and realized that the relative was actually referring to a
generalization of the Eulerian method by the two śulapuruṣa-s Runge and
Kutta. This differential equation offered us an opportunity to apply it
to something interesting and we spent sometime writing a program to do
the same. With that in hand, we could solve the above 2nd order DE by
writing it as two linked 1st order ordinary DEs.

Consequently, we had an unfolding of the solutions for it which
presented an interesting picture (Figure 1): We saw before our eyes the
entire range of oscillations with simple periodicity, quasi-periodicity,
superimposed beats of different frequencies and various types of chaotic
oscillations. Thus, we saw this simple DE recapitulate all manner of
oscillatory phenomena we had encountered in nature: the changes is
numbers of molecules in during the cell cycle, populations of organisms
in the ecosystem, climatic patterns and the light-curves of variable
stars.

This note might be read as a continuation of the these two earlier
ones:  
1) [The Aśvin-s and
Rudra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/the-asvin-s-and-rudra/)  
2) [The roots of Vaiṣṇavam: a view from the numerology of Vedic
texts](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/02/the-roots-of-vai%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87avam-a-view-from-the-numerology-of-vedic-texts/)

In the Ṛgveda (RV), the Marut-s are seen associating with Viṣṇu on
several occasions. This often occurs in the context of the epithets
evaya or eṣa (meaning swift or ardent) being applied to them. This
association is not per say out of place or surprising because it might
be seen in the context of Viṣṇu accompanying Indra in the battle against
Vṛtra, where the Marut-s too accompany Indra as his troops (gaṇa-s).
Thus, they might be seen as surrounding Viṣṇu, one of the leaders of the
deva-s in this battle. However, this association is not purely a mythic
one — in the context of the RV it extends to the Marut-s and Viṣṇu being
invoked together for receiving offerings in a specific ritual. For
example, this is clearly stated by Gṛtsamada Śaunahotra:

tān vo maho maruta evayāvno  
viṣṇor eṣasya prabhṛthe havāmahe ।  
hiraṇyavarṇān kakuhān yatasruco  
brahmaṇyantaḥ śaṃsyaṃ rādha īmahe ॥ RV2.34.11

Verily those great Maruts, speeding along  
we invoke in the ritual offering of the swift Viṣṇu  
with extended sruc-s, the golden eminent ones,  
composing incantations, we implore them of praiseworthy liberality.

This is again presented in the context of the soma offering by Gotama
Rāhūgaṇa:

te ‘vardhanta svatavaso mahitvanā  
nākaṃ tasthur uru cakrire sadaḥ ।  
viṣṇur yad dhāvad vṛṣaṇam madacyutaṃ  
vayo na sīdann adhi barhiṣi priye ॥ RV 1.85.7

Those growing in their greatness, the self-powerful ones  
They stood in the high heaven and made \[themselves\] a broad seat.  
When Viṣṇu washed the bull dripping with exhilaration (soma)  
like birds they sat down on the dear ritual grass.

Unlike the Marut-s, in the RV, their father Rudra is not commonly paired
with Viṣṇu except in the general context of the incantations invoking
multiple deities. This is keeping with the absence of any evidence for
his participation in the Vedic narration of the Vṛtra-hatyā. However,
there is one exception where Rudra is mentioned along with Viṣṇu in a
ritual context similar to the Marut-s by Vasiṣṭha Maitravaruṇi:

asya devasya mīḻhuṣo (‘)vayā  
viṣṇor eṣasya prabhṛthe havirbhiḥ ।  
vide hi rudro rudriyam mahitvaṃ  
yāsiṣṭaṃ vartir aśvināv irāvat ॥ RV 7.40.5

The appeasement of the god who is bountiful (Rudra)  
\[is done\] in the ritual of the swift Viṣṇu with oblations;  
for Rudra knows his Rudrian might.  
May you Aśvin-s drive on your food-bearing orbit.

This is notable in two ways: 1) there is a specific mention of Rudra
being appeased in the ritual of Viṣṇu. This exactly parallels the
offering to the Marut-s in the ritual of Viṣṇu. 2) There is also a
reference to Aśvin-s being called for the ritual. They are said to come
on their food-bearing orbit (vartis), which reminds one of their epithet
Rudravartanī, i.e. they who follow on the track of Rudra.

What is the ritual being referred to here? The answer to this comes from
the deployment in the somayāga of another sūkta emphasizing the link of
the Marut-s and Viṣṇu — the famous Evayamarut-sūkta of the Atri-s. This
sūkta is deployed in a key recitation of the hotṛ-s in the somayāga
known as the Śilpa-śastra-s. While it is described in all the RV
brāhmaṇa-s, the most detailed account is given the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa:

śilpāni śaṃsanti । devaśilpāny eteṣām vai śilpānām anukṛtīha śilpam
adhigamyate । hastī kaṃso vāso hiraṇyam aśvatarī-rathaḥ śilpaṃ; śilpaṃ
hāsminn adhigamyate ya evaṃ veda; yad eva śilpānī3n ātma-saṃskṛtir vāva
śilpāni; chandomayaṃ vā etair yajamāna ātmānaṃ saṃskurute ।

They recite the Śilpa-s. These are divine art-works; by imitating these
\[divine\] art-works a \[human\] work of art is achieved here. An
elephant (evidently image of one), metal-work, weaving, gold-work,
mule-cart-making are \[such human\] craft-works. A work of art is
accomplished by him who knows thus. Regarding those known as the
Śilpa-s, the Śilpa-s are a perfection of the self; indeed by them the
ritualist perfects himself imbued with the meters.

In this introduction to the Śilpa-śastra-s, the brāhmaṇa teaches the
Hindu “Platonic” principle that all human craft-works are imitations of
the works of the deva-s (also c.f. [the Ratu-s of the
Iranians](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/the-broken-chain-and-the-chain-of-knowledge/)).
It is in this spirit the ritualist engages in this śastra recitation so
that he might become saṃskṛta or perfect even as the metrical chants —
their composers saw them as similar to crafts, sometimes using the
phrase that they composed the ṛk-s much like a craftsman making a
chariot. Now, the Śilpa-śastra-s consist of a long series of chants: 1)
the two sūkta-s of the ancient Nābhānediṣṭha, the descendant of Manu
Sāvarṇi (his name is also recorded in Iranian tradition). The first of
these prominently features the gods Rudra and the Aśvin-s (explicitly
termed sons of Rudra-s in this sūkta) and is recited by the hotṛ. 2) The
long aindra-sūkta-s of the Kāṇva-s known as the Vālakhilyā-s in the
bṛhatī and satobṛhatī meters. These are recited by maitravaruṇa by
intricate separations of the pada-s and half verses. 3) The sūkta of the
great descendant of Dīrghatamas, Sukīrti Kākṣīvata (RV 10.131), which is
central to the offering of beer in sautrāmaṇi ritual, featuring the
Aśvin-s as physicians primarily along with Indra and Sarasvatī again in
her medicinal form. Then the enigmatic Vṛṣākapi-sūkta is deployed which
presents the banter between Indra and Indrāṇi. As this sūkta is recited
the ritualist identifies its verses with the constitution of his body
from hair, skin, fleshy organs, bones and marrow. This is recited by the
brāhmaṇacchaṅsin. 4) The recitation of the śastra that includes the
Rudra-dhāyyā and the Evayāmarut-sūkta to Viṣṇu and the Marut-s (see
below). In extant tradition the Rudra-dhāyyā is a single ṛk RV 1.43.6 of
Kaṇva Ghaura. Between the two is inserted the sūkta of Bharadvāja
starting with “dyaur na ya …” (RV 6.20). This śastra is explicitly
recited with the insertion of the “o” vowels, i.e. nyūṅkha style of
recitation by the acāvāka, the fourth of the hotraka-s. The
Aitareya-brāhmaṇa records an interesting old tale regarding this śastra,
which suggests that it was redacted to attain its current structure:

sa ha bulila āśvatara āśvir vaiśvajito hotāsann īkṣāṃ cakra: eṣāṃ vā
eṣāṃ śilpānāṃ viśvajiti sāṃvatsarike dve madhyaṃdinam abhi pratyetor
hantāham ittham evayāmarutaṃ śaṃsayānīti । tad dha tathā śaṃsayāṃ
cakāra; tad dha tathā śasyāmane gauśla ājagāma; sa hovāca hotaḥ kathā te
śastraṃ vicakram plavata iti; kiṃ hy abhūd ity ? evayāmarud ayam
uttarataḥ śasyata iti; sa hovācaindro vai madhyaṃdinaḥ,  
kathendram madhyaṃdinān ninīṣasīti; nendram madhyaṃdinān ninīṣāmīti
hovāca; chandas tv idam amadhyaṃdinasācy ayaṃ jāgato vātijāgato vā।
sarvaṃ vā idaṃ jāgataṃ vātijāgataṃ vā । sa u māruto maiva śaṃsiṣṭeti; sa
hovācāramāchāvakety; atha hāsminn anuśāsanam īṣe; sa hovācaindram eṣa
viṣṇunyaṅgaṃ śaṃsatv; atha tvam etaṃ hotar upariṣṭād raudryai dhāyyāyai
purastān mārutasyāpyasyāthā iti; tad dha tathā śaṃsayāṃ cakāra । tad
idam apy etarhi tathaiva śasyate ॥

That Bulila Āśvatara Āśvi was the hotṛ in the viśvajit ritual; he
observed: of these Śilpa-s in the year-long Viśvajit ritual these two
(the recitations of the maitravaruṇa and brāhmaṇacchaṅsin) are added to
the midday recitation. Well, let me have the Evayāmarut recited \[by the
acāvāka\]. He then made that to be recited. When it was being thus
recited Gauśla came up; he said: “O hotṛ why is your śastra sinking
without a wheel?” B.A.A: “What happened? The Evayāmarut is being recited
to the north of the altar.” He (G) said: “Indra is verily the midday.
Why do you seek lead Indra away from from the midday?” “I do not seek to
lead Indra away from the midday”, he replied. G: “The meter is also not
that for the midday, jagati or atijagati. All these \[incantations\]
(Evayāmarut) are either jagati or atijagati. It is also of the Marut-s;
do not recite it.” He (B.A.A) said: “Stop O acāvāka”. He (B.A.A) then
sought an instruction on this. He (G) said: “He may recite the Indra
hymn with the mark of Viṣṇu. Now, O Hotṛ this is inserted between the
preceding Rudra Dhāyyā and the following Māruta (i.e. Evayāmarut). Then
he (B.A.A) made it be be thus recited. Even now that is how it is
recited.”

The tale hints that originally or in certain traditions this
Śilpa-śastra consisted of just the invocation of Rudra, Viṣṇu and the
Marut-s in an offering centered on Viṣṇu and the Marut-s. However, as
stated, it was emended to include Indra to maintain the connection of
the midday rite with Indra. Nevertheless, even in this, the sūkta
indicated to Indra was chosen such that the original connection of the
offering with Viṣṇu was retained. The second ṛk of the inserted sūkta
goes thus:

divo na tubhyam anv indra satra  
asuryaṃ devebhir dhāyi viśvam ।  
ahiṃ yad vṛtram apo vavrivāṃsaṃ  
hann ṛjīṣin viṣṇunā sacānaḥ ॥ RV 6.20.2

Just as that of Dyaus, to you, O Indra, the power  
of the Asura-s was entirely ceded by the deva-s,  
when you, O drinker of silvery juice, accompanied by Viṣṇu  
smote the snake Vṛtra blocking the waters.

This is the mark of Viṣṇu mentioned in the brāhmaṇa. Given that the
immediate juxtaposition of Rudra, Viṣṇu and the Marut-s in a ritual all
together is a distinctive one, it is apparent that one of the form
encapsulated in the final Śilpa-śastra was something widely known to the
early RV composers and specifically alluded to. This is further
supported by the observation that the above Vāsiṣṭha ṛk also mentions
the Aśvin-s. As can be seen in the Śilpa-śastra-s, another prominent
deity of the recitations are the Aśvin-s who are explicitly coupled with
Rudra in the first Nābhānediṣtha sūkta.

It may also be noted that the juxtaposition of Rudra, the Marut-s and
Viṣṇu also has a further echo in the śrauta ritual. In the piling of the
Agnicayana altar, after the fifth and final layer of bricks has been
laid it is said to ghora or terrible and if the adhvaryu steps on it he
is said to die. This is because the newly laid altar is said to be
possessed by the fierce manifestation of Agni as Rudra. Hence, Rudra has
to be pacified by offerings of goat milk with a milkweed leaf on a
specific brick of the altar (brick 189 in the standard Agnicayana eagle
altar) with the recitation of the Śatarudrīya by the adhvaryu. Once that
is over, the ritualist goes clockwise around the altar impersonating
Rudra by holding a bow and 3 arrows. Stopping at the vertices of a
pentagon in course of that circuit, at each stop he recites the
incantation to Rudra of the 5 years of the saṃvatsara cycle as the lord
of the wind. The adhvaryu gives a pitcher of water to the pratiprasthātṛ
and asks him to make 3 circuits pouring it out in a continuous stream.
As he does so, the adhvaryu and the ritualist recite the incantation to
the Marut-s (e.g. Taittirīya-saṃhitā 4.6.1.1) who are called upon to
provide the energy residing in stones, mountains, wind, rain, the fury
of Varuṇa, water bodies, herbs and trees as the strength of food. Once
the pacification of Rudra is complete, and the fire is installed on it,
the altar is said to be śānta or peaceful and to give the yajamana a
great bounty that is asked for in the camaka incantations. These
accompany the vasor dhārā offerings wherein a continuous stream of ghee
is poured into the fire with a special furrowed log-guide known as the
praseka that is as tall as the ritualist. Finally, after the offering is
done, the ghee-soaked praseka itself is offered in the fire. This ritual
begins with the following gāyatrī incantation:

agnāvīṣṇū sajoṣasemā vardhantu vāṃ giraḥ । dyumnair vajebhir āgatam ॥

Agni and Viṣṇu, may these chants glorify you together. Come with
radiance and vigor!

Regarding these oblations the śruti of the Taittirīya-s offers the
following brāhmaṇa:

brahmavādino vadanti: yan na devatāyai juhvaty atha kiṃdevatyā vasor
dhāreti ? agnir vasus tasyaiṣā dhārā; viṣṇur vasus tasyaiṣā dhārā
āgnāvaiṣṇavy arcā vasor dhārāṃ juhoti; bhāgadheyenaivainau sam
ardhayati; atho etām evāhutim āyatanavatīṃ karoti; yatkāma enāṃ juhoti
tad evāva runddhe; rudro vā eṣa yad agnis; tasyaite tanuvau ghorānyā
śivānayā; yac chatarudrīyaṃ juhoti yaivāsya ghorā tanūs tāṃ tena
śamayati; yad vasor dhārāṃ juhoti yaivāsya śivā tanūs tāṃ tena prīṇāti;
yo vai vasor dhārayai pratiṣṭhāṃ veda praty eva tiṣṭhati ॥ in TS 5.7.3

The brahmavādin-s say: “Given that they do not offer to any deity (i.e
svāhā-s are uttered without naming the deity), which deity has the vasor
dhārā oblation? Wealth is Agni (or Agni is a Vasu); this stream is his.
Wealth is Viṣṇu; this stream is his. With the verse addressed to Agni
and Viṣṇu (the above gāyatrī) he offers the stream of wealth; verily he
unites them with their proper portions. He also makes this offering in
order to have an abode. He wins that desire for which he makes this
offering. The fire is Rudra; now two are his bodies, one is dreadful,
the other is auspicious. That in which he offers the Śatarudrīya is its
dreadful one. He pacifies it with that \[Śatarudrīya offering\]. That in
which he offers the vasor dhārā is the auspicious one. He delights it
with that \[vasor dhārā offering\]. He, who knows the foundation of the
vasor dhārā indeed stands well-founded.”

Thus, Rudra and the Marut-s on one hand and Viṣṇu on the other are
identified with the opposing but juxtaposed characteristics of Agni and
invoked as deities in the two key rituals associated with completed
Agnicayana altar. That this juxtaposition is not just incidental but a
deeper feature of the traditions of the Indo-Aryan world and in a more
general form the greater Indo-European world is hinted by the tendencies
expressed in the itihāsa-s: In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rudra offered great favors
the malefic Rāvaṇa who is opposed to the Indra-Viṣṇu duo humanized as
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. More explicitly, in the Mahābhārata, the humanized
manifestation of Rudra, Aśvatthāman is the malevolent force opposed to
the humanized Indra-Viṣṇu-Agni manifestations in the form of Arjuna,
Kṛṣṇa and Dhṛṣṭadyumna and the other daiva forces. Similarly, Rudra
backs Jayadratha allowing him to overcome the Pāṇḍu-s on the fateful day
of the slaying of Abhimanyu. Yet again, in the same epic a malefic
Rudra-backed figure Śiśupāla (born with 3 eyes) is also presented in
opposition to the humanized manifestation of Viṣṇu. A comparable form of
opposition also extends the Greek world, where, in their national epic,
the Rudrian deities Apollo and Ares prominently back the Trojans against
the Greeks who are backed by Athena.

Based on the inferred prominence of Rudra and Viṣṇu in the para-Vedic
and “greater” Vedic horizons (i.e. the root of the ādhvaryava
tradition), we can say that this juxtaposition of them was a reflection
in the “standard aindra religion” of tendencies which were more
pronounced outside it: i.e. the cults centered on Rudra and Viṣṇu. This
is hinted by the fact that right in the Kauṣītaki-brāhmaṇa, in the
corresponding account of the Śilpa-śastra-s with the Rudra-dhāyyā and
the Evayāmarut with the nyūñkhā “o” insertions, we encounter the below
statement:

atho rudro vai jyeṣṭhaś ca śreṣṭhaś ca devānām ।

Now Rudra is indeed the eldest and the best of the gods.

This indicates that the early “śaiva” view was already impinging on the
“standard aindra religion”. As we have noted
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/02/the-roots-of-vai%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87avam-a-view-from-the-numerology-of-vedic-texts/),
the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa correspondingly, provides an early “vaiṣṇava”
viewpoint hinting the primacy of Viṣṇu. That such tendencies were
ancient is indicated by the fact that they are not restricted to
branches of the Ārya-s who eventually conquered India — indeed they are
hinted by parallels seen among the Iranians and the Germanic peoples.
Interestingly, it was that stream of the religion that was to eventually
dominate the Ārya religious traditions in India in the form of the Śaiva
and Vaiṣnava cults.

That we have come to be in these pandemic days evokes some wonderment or
even disbelief among laypeople. The general thinking of a large section
of the populace is that this event is something completely unexpected or
out of the way. Hence, some of them are quite prone to invoke different
kinds of outre explanations, the most common being: “It must be a Cīna
bioweapon (I hear from Cīna-s that in their midst it is common to think
of it as a mleccha bioweapon).” In the least many of them might say it
is something “unnatural”. However, for those more familiar with the
natural history of these matters it is more of an expected thing that
was almost waiting to happen and events specifically like this have
probably happened going back some time into the past. The only thing we
could not say is when exactly it would happen. In this note we shall
rehash these matters in the language of an educated layperson. In our
earlier writings on this we sort of took it for granted that this is
probably clear to everyone but apparently it is not and in any case
there are some interesting points to place out there for the reader.

First, it is not that pandemics are a distant memory; they happen quite
frequently with the the negative-strand RNA viruses of the influenza
genus: many people might remember H1N1 influenza and some may have even
gotten it. Older people will remember how the retrovirus HIV-1 caused
the AIDS pandemic. Of course none of these were anywhere as crippling as
the current Wuhan disease but these at least give us a feel for the
potentialities of such things and that they are not a matter of distant
folktale. Second, apart from pandemics there have been several smaller
viral outbreaks like Ebolavirus and Henipavirus, both also
negative-strand RNA viruses. Third, there is also the regular
vector-borne pestilence of the positive-strand RNA viruses from which
you or somebody in your family might have suffered or died: the
flaviviruses, like the Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus,
West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus and their more distant
relative the togavirus, Chikungunya virus. Not be left behind we even
have the occasional Nucleo-cytoplasmic Large DNA virus like the
Monkeypox virus give a smallpox look-alike to its victims. Thus,
infectious viral disease is very much part of our existence and it does
not take much imagination to see one of these will emerge to deliver a
punch more to the extreme right end of the distribution of effects.

Of course when this is pointed out someone would say: “Come on, did any
of those put us in a state like what we are in right now? This
coronavirus is special !” There is a reason I did not mention
coronaviruses in the above list — they are indeed special in a way to
deserve separate consideration but what we are experiencing is also
quite expected given what we know of the natural history of these the
coronaviruses. To apprehend this distinction let us first look at some
examples of other viruses acquired by humans from non-human animals.
There have been numerous crossovers of viruses between different species
in course of evolution. For example, the positive-strand RNA
hepeliviruses, which include the likes of the animal Rubella and
Hepatitis E viruses on one hand and the plant Beet necrotic yellow vein
viruses on the other represent an extreme crossover between plants and
animals. Thus, this process is an unavoidable part of life. There many
more cases of recent crossovers of viruses from non-human animals to
humans, some of which are well-studied. However, the mode in which these
crossovers get established in humans makes a big difference: the
vector-borne flaviviruses and togaviruses are easy to establish in
humans from the bite of an insect like the ubiquitous mosquito but to
keep transmitting they need more of those bites in the critical phase of
viremia (when the virus is in the blood). This is in principle
preventable to quite a degree by relatively simple means like the use of
insect repellents (already mentioned in the Atharvaveda) or mosquito
nets (a luxury that even the normally morose tathāgata allowed for his
saṃgha around 2500 years ago). Indeed, some countries have done quite
well with with various insect-borne viruses by relatively simple but
rigorous prevention programs.

1. A cryo-electron micrographic image of the capsid of the HIV-1 virus:
a beautiful object.

Another very well-studied example of crossover from non-human animals to
human is AIDS, which is caused by two distinct but related viruses,
HIV-1 and HIV-2. Of these, HIV-1 was transmitted from chimpanzees and
gorillas to humans in west central Africa on at least 4 distinct
occasions (2 times from chimps, 1 time from gorilla and 1 time from
either). Only one of these (HIV-1 M) after festering in Africa for
nearly 30-50 years radiated out of the Kinshasa region to establish a
global pandemic. Chimps in turn acquired the chimp precursor of HIV-1,
SIVcpz, from the SIV infecting Cercopithecus and Cercocebus monkeys
which they prey upon. The monkeys infected with SIV are unaffected by
the virus and lead a mostly normal life. However, in chimps it is
sexually transmitted with roughly the same probability per heterosexual
coitus (0.0008–0.0015 ) as in humans (0.0011) and greatly increases the
mortality of the infected ape. Its dispersion through the chimp
populations appears to have been primarily driven by the mobility of
infected females. Gorillas appear to have acquired SIVgor from chimps.
Since gorillas do not hunt chimps or vice versa but both live in
overlapping ranges, it raises the possibility of rare gorilla-chimp
matings during which the infection was transmitted. The acquisition of
HIV-2 by humans was from a Cercocebus monkey (sooty mangabey) precursor,
SIVsmm. Given that in the monkey community the highest infection by
SIVsmm is seen in high-ranked females, it is evidently harmless to the
monkeys. In humans too only a minority of the infected individuals
proceed to developing AIDS and it is limited to West Africa. While
human-chimp/gorilla matings might have occurred on rare occasions, the
relatively low and similar probability of sexual transmission in humans
and chimps, and the HIV-2 crossover from monkeys suggest that both HIVs
primarily originated from mucosal contacts or blood during “bush-meat”
hunting — thus humans and chimps got AIDS in a similar way from their
prey. However, after crossover from monkeys its transmission in all
three great apes (Homo included) is primarily sexual. At least in
humans, this is still a relatively low probability event per coitus and
quite preventable by behavioral means. Thus, even the famous AIDS
pandemic took a long time to break out and only one out 5 independent
non-human to human crossovers resulted in a pandemic. Not surprisingly,
it was eventually managed quite effectively in the general population
except for the locations with exaggerated sexual promiscuity.

Coming to coronaviruses proper, apart from being in the hall of fame for
having the largest single-segmented RNA genomes, they are specialists of
transmission by the respiratory and the orofecal route. Since, you
cannot avoid getting air, food or water into your body these viruses are
much harder to manage than the rest once they jump to humans. Moreover,
primates being very “facially” oriented creatures, have particular risk
to infection by these modes. It is this distinction that makes them one
of the most likely viral agents to pack a big punch if they establish a
pandemic. In evolutionary terms, the crown clade of coronaviruses
consists of 4 major subclades: the alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoV) and
betacoronaviruses (beta-CoV) which primarily infect mammals form one
higher order group. Basal to them are the deltacoronaviruses and
gammacoronaviruses primarily infect birds (Figure 2; but see below for
exceptions). Outside of these lie the more basal Gull Coronavirus and
the lizard-infecting Guangdong Chinese water skink coronavirus. This
suggests that the original radiation of the coronaviruses was likely in
the late Paleozoic-Mesozoic where they emerged in reptiles and probably
infected both the great branches of reptiles lepidosaurs (including
lizards) and archosaurs (including dinosaurs). With the close of the
Mesozoic they lingered on in the surviving dinosaurs, i.e. the birds, as
the delta-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages. From birds it is likely that they
made at least two major jumps to mammals probably facilitated by these
vertebrates sharing a warm-blooded physiology with body temperatures in
the same general range. One was to bats, which was probably via shared
nesting sites and this founded the alpha-CoV and beta-CoV lineages
within bats. The next primary transmission, probably due to predation of
birds by dolphins transmitted the gamma-CoVs to dolphins/whales. The
alpha-CoV and beta-CoV radiated extensively in bats alongside numerous
other viruses such as the negative-strand RNA filoviruses (Ebola-like),
henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses (rabies) for which bats play great
hosts. Further, from bats and birds coronaviruses appear to have
episodically invaded a wide range of placental mammals.

Figure 2. Modified from original figure published in “Discovery of a
Novel Coronavirus, China Rattus Coronavirus HKU24, from Norway Rats
Supports the Murine Origin of Betacoronavirus 1 and Has Implications for
the Ancestor of Betacoronavirus Lineage A” by Susanna K. P. Lau et al.

In the past 20 years we have been witness to several such invasions of
humans and domesticated mammals (Figure 2):  
1) SARS-CoV of the Beta-CoV clade, the agent of the SARS outbreak which
began in November 2002 in Foshan City, Guangdong, China, definitely
started from bats but reached humans via civets, which are eaten by the
Cīna-s. In August 2003 a virology student in Singapore and in April 2004
two laboratory personnel at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing
were independently infected by laboratory SARS-CoV due to poor
virological technique.  
2) In 2012 MERS outbreak started in Arabia with the transmission of a
distinct beta-CoV from dromedaries to humans. Dromedaries are often
imported to Arabia from Africa where a closely related virus has been
found in bats suggesting that the camels first acquired it from bats in
Africa and then transmitted it humans.  
3) Again in 2012, the coronavirus HKU15 was detected in pigs in Hong
Kong. This delta-CoV appears to have jumped from birds to mammals
probably in the unhygienic live markets of China. In 2014 it caused
outbreaks of a diarrheal disease in several states of the USA. In Asia
it seems to have further spread from pigs to wild cats.  
4) In 2017, not far from the place of original SARS outbreak, in
Guangdong, China, a novel alpha-CoV caused a major outbreak of acute
swine diarrhea syndrome (SADS-CoV) decimating a large number of piglets,
which are an important food item of the Cīna-s. It was transmitted from
bats which are infected by a related HKU2r-CoV. Outbreaks of this virus
have continued in Chinese pig populations till as of an year back.  
5) In November of 2019 a repeat performance of the SARS event happened
in Wuhan, China, with the related SARS-CoV-2 jumping from bats to humans
directly or via an intermediate which could have been something like
cats that are consumed by the Cīna-s. This has become the agent of the
current pandemic.

One thing we have learned from the intense scrutiny of the few proteins
encoded by the HIVs and SIVs it that they have evolved 3 independent
mechanisms (via the proteins Vpu in HIV-1 M, via Nef in SIV of chimps,
gorilla and monkeys, and Env in HIV-2) of countering a key general
purpose host immunity mechanism against enveloped viruses, namely
inhibition of the surface protein BST-2 (tetherin), which blocks the
budding of virions (viral particles). Interestingly, the SARS
coronavirus has evolved its own independent mechanism to do the same and
we believe a similar mechanism is used by its cousin SARS-CoV-2, the
causative agent of the Wuhan disease, and more generally by both
alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. We shall not dilate on that
here (as it will touched upon in a more formal venue) but shall simply
state that such adaptations that allow disabling of this general
immunity mechanism appear to be one general convergent feature common to
distant viruses that might facilitate the jump to humans and closely
related apes.

Cīna authors themselves have stated in no unclear terms that the Cīna
love for “live (i.e. slaughtered on the pan) meat”, which is held to be
more nutritious in traditional Cīna medicine, provides huge
opportunities for such outbreaks to happen. Given that 4 different
coronavirus outbreaks have happened from crossovers with connections to
bush-meat or unhygienic live markets prior to 2019, from a natural
history standpoint the current pandemic was just a matter of time.
Further, the lab accidents resulting in infections and human-to-human
transmission in the Chinese case indicate that those too in principle
could be further sources of infection, especially in the Cīna context.
Notably, the way MERS reached the other end of Asia in the form of the
Korean outbreak and killed tens of people there showed how globalization
and
[Galtonism](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/04/05/the-culmination-of-galtonism-or-pandemic-days-1/)
would drive local epidemics to pandemics. Given all this, the current
pandemic is not unexpected since one of these outbreaks was eventually
going to hit the “sweet spot” like SARS-CoV-2, especially, as noted
above, coronaviruses are imminently suited for something like this. In
light of this, the utter failure in the response of several governments
all over the world shows that certain forms of predictive knowledge,
especially in the mathematical or biological domain, remain rather
privileged and are not easily grasped by the elite.

Given that we have had 5 coronaviral outbreaks in humans and livestock
in the past 20 years, one question that comes to mind is whether there
have been such coronaviral outbreaks/pandemics in the past? As we noted
before, pandemics from globalization is not a new thing; so, there is no
strong reason why there should not have been past coronaviral outbreaks.
Before SARS, coronaviruses were hardly seen as threatening to humans and
little effort was expended on the two human coronaviruses discovered in
the 1960s (see below). After SARS more attention was paid to the
apparently milder coronaviruses that infect humans yielding a wealth of
data. This growing interest led the discovery of a new alpha-CoV, HCoV
NL63, in 2004 as an agent of human respiratory disease. Subsequent
studies have shown that it is responsible for croup in children (a
condition already described in old Hindu medicine as caused by the
Śvagraha, an agent of the god Kumāra) and sometimes more serious lower
respiratory track involvement in both children and adults. Like
SARS-CoV-2, it appears to trigger rare instances of the Kawasaki disease
in children. Despite its recent discovery, HCoV NL63 does not represent
a recent crossover from non-human animals because at the time of its
discovery it was already a well-established pandemic. Nevertheless, its
closest relatives are viruses infecting bats which suggest that it might
have invaded humans ultimately from bats about 1000-500 years ago.
Another related alpha-CoV, HCoV 229E, which was discovered in 1966 and
has subsequently been shown to be a notable cause respiratory infections
throughout the world with a preponderance in immunocompromised
individuals. Interestingly, an early serological study in the 1960s
showed that HCoV 229E antibodies were detected primarily in adults as
opposed to near absence in children — something which reminds one of the
higher severity of SARS-CoV-2 in adults as opposed to children. The
closest relatives of HCoV 229E are again found in bats and suggest a
crossover perhaps in the last 2000 years.

Another comparable pair of human coronaviruses are HCoV OC43 and HCoV
HKU1 that belong to the so-called “lineage A” of Beta-CoV. The HCoV
OC43, the first human coronavirus to be discovered, was reported in 1965
as “a novel type of common-cold virus.” Subsequently, it has been widely
reported as major cause of upper respiratory tract infections (perhaps
5-30% of such infections) and a more severe lower respiratory track
involvement as a pneumonia in elderly people. Interestingly, it has been
reported to also cause rare instances of fatal encephalitis and
Kawasaki’s disease, both of which have also been seen with SARS-CoV-2.
Notably, in one survey up to 57% of the patients with HCoV OC43
infections reported enteric tract manifestations. Indeed, early studies
in the 1980s associated strains of HCoV OC43 with human gastroenteritis.
This is again rather reminiscent of the enteric involvement suggested
for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Following the renewed interest in
these viruses in the post-SARS era, a related virus HCoV HKU1 was
reported in 2004 from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia who had just
returned to Hong Kong from Shenzhen, China. A subsequent survey showed
that it was also widely established in humans across the world and
primarily caused a “cold-like” URTI though in some cases it might worsen
to a pneumonia. However, it causes a significantly higher incidence of
febrile seizures than other respiratory tract viruses. These two
beta-CoVs have no particularly close relatives among bat viruses.
Instead, HCoV OC43 belongs to a complex of closely viruses in “lineage
A” including the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and the equine coronavirus
(ECoV) both of which cause episodic outbreaks of enteric disease,
sometimes with respiratory manifestations in livestock. Of the two, HCoV
OC43 is closer to the the BCoV. In 1994, a recent crossover of BCoV to
humans was reported resulting in a case of acute diarrhea in a human
patient (HECV-4408). This suggests that HCoV OC43 represents another
such earlier crossover from cattle that got established in humans as a
pandemic. It is not clear when exactly this happened but likely it
happened sometime after the domestication of cattle by humans. Some have
proposed that OC43 was the agent of the “Russian flu” in 1889-1890 CE.
However, we believe that this is based on erroneous molecular clocks
estimates. However, it cannot be ruled out that the “Russian flu” was
another viral cross over. In contrast, HCoV HKU1 defines a distinct
subclade within “lineage A” but is nested among rodent coronaviruses
such as the Murine Hepatitis virus, the Rat-CoV and the China Rat HKU24.
This suggests that it might have crossed over from rodents which are
widely consumed by humans in East Asia (Figure 2).

There are some interesting common features of above-discussed four human
coronaviruses: today they cause relatively mild URTIs in healthy
individuals but have the potential for causing more serious conditions
including fatal pneumonia or neural complications. This is reminiscent
of SARS-CoV-2, which is relatively mild in majority of individuals but
causes a far more severe infection in the rest (of course at a much
higher rate than the above-mentioned CoVs). This raises the possibility
that they were once virulent viruses comparable to SARS-CoV-2 that
crossed over directly or indirectly from bats, cattle and rodents in the
past and have now evolved to a mild state due to selection on the host
and virus. Thus, in these milder human CoVs we might be seeing remnants
of a past outbreaks that might have begun as severe infections in some
ways comparable to the current one. What might be the scenarios in which
they might have begun? At least HCoV OC43 may have started early with
cattle domestication. In contrast, HCoV NL63 and HCoV 229E from bats and
HCoV HKU1 from rodents probably originated in China or elsewhere East
Asia where consumption of such animals is prevalent. Africa is another
possibility, though the relatively low connectivity of Africa to the
rest of the world until not long ago makes it less likely. The 2007, the
camelids known as alpacas (llamas) were found to be infected by a novel
coronavirus closely related to HCoV 229E resulting in the alpaca
respiratory disease. This points to a recent crossover from another
animal source — this evidently parallels the original crossover of the
related virus to humans. These pre-modern events probably spread more
slowly than today’s SARS-CoV-2 and could have even involved a relatively
severe local epidemic followed by attenuation of the virus before a
wider spread. This also suggests that, barring successful intervention,
such a trajectory is probably the one by which SARS-CoV-2 will become
less threatening.

This course of attenuation seems to follow a full circle: Both SIV/HIV
and coronaviruses are asymptomatic or mild respectively in monkeys and
bats. Once they crossover to apes the disease is way more severe and
fitness reducing. Then eventually they might reconfigure to a milder
state in the new host. Indeed, in traditionally bat-eating tribes of
Africa, India and East Asia there might have been past epidemics which
were generally limited due to the isolation of these tribe and over time
attenuated forms of the virus probably emerged giving them higher
immunity against such viruses. Those viruses that established a severe
infection in humans probably limited themselves in the pre-modern era as
they rapidly destroyed the populations they invaded before they could
access another population. Thus, the drive tends to be towards a more
attenuated state over time unless other factors are in play. However,
this is a complex process as the virus first undergoes selection for
better establishment in the new host which might not necessarily
attenuate it in the early stages and then probably it undergoes more
attenuating changes. The first set of such changes happened in both the
SIV/HIV and also in parallel in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV it
is primarily in the form of the disruption or loss of a viral protein
called ORF8 whose mystery we have finally solved and will be presented
in a more formal venue. This happened independently in Singaporean
isolates of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that the two viruses are likely under
similar selection from human immunity.

Studies on SIV/HIV infectivity has shown that Old World monkeys are
resistant to HIV-1 because they likely have multiple defenses against
it. The best studied is the TRIM5 protein which inactivates the virus by
interfering with the proper uncoating of the viral capsid inside the
cell. Old World Monkeys also produce a cyclic peptide retrocyclin-2,
which is a broad-spectrum anti-microbial killing both bacteria and
HIV-1. Neither does the human TRIM5 bind HIV efficiently nor do humans
produce retrocyclin-2. Such changes illustrate things happening on the
host side due to natural selection by episodes of viral outbreaks. One
may ask why lose such potent defenses? First, TRIM5 is under selection
depending on the episodes of retroviral epidemics a population goes
through; thus, it may evolve away from one specificity towards what is
the latest danger. So a past epidemic evidently drew TRIM5 specificity
in great apes of our lineage away from HIV-1 binding because that was a
more demanding pressure. Thus, when HIV-1 entered human populations they
were in a state of adaptation that was likely still directed at a now
gone virus. Second, the case of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates that much of the
human morbidity appears to arise from self-damage caused by an
unregulated immune response in some individuals. Thus, viral pressure
can also select against some immune weaponry that can cause such
self-damage. This can result in evolution of a more attenuated
interaction of the host with the virus. However, this can also come at
the expense of once effective weaponry which is lost under such
selection — it is possible that we lost retrocyclin-2 due to some past
pathogen pressure acting at the base of the great ape lineage. This also
reminds one the actions of the Cīna researcher who created Crispr Ding
and Crispr Dong by editing out the gene for the CCR5 7-transmembrane
receptor — the receptor used by HIV-1 to get into cells. However, CCR5
is a receptor protein for at least 5 signaling proteins called
chemokines in the immune system. While it might provide resistance to
HIV-1 and in the past might have also interacted with the Smallpox
Virus, it is rather useful for immunity against other viruses like the
West Nile virus. Hence, docking it might actually increase
susceptibility in a different direction.

Vrishchika had been seeing several kids of patients affected by the
chemical leak that had happened sometime ago. While she saw some purely
for routine clinical practice, she was also particularly interested in
the several cases exhibiting heterotaxy and had amassed a collection of
such. With Indrasena she had identified a collection of mutations in
these patients and those from elsewhere. Eventually, with Lootika and
Somakhya they had translated it into some interesting and ancient
biochemistry concerning membrane protein stability that was widespread
in eukaryotes. Now they were sitting down at Somakhya and Lootika’s
house to work on a manuscript on this matter. As they did so, they asked
their sons to get some lessons from Jhilleeka.

To get her nephews started Jhilleeka asked them: “So what did you two
learn from Tigmanika’s grandfather little ones?”  
Guhasena: “He taught us something very important which the very basis of
the apprehension of the space of our everyday life: the
gardabha-nyāya.”  
J: “Could you tell me what that is?”  
Tigmanika: “He said that even though in the early days when our
ancestors roamed on the steppes they saw the braying ass as something
alien and evil, they came around to see it as an animal that should be
respected. He felt that was because it taught us the gardabha-nyāya:
gardabho ‘pi tryaśre hrasiṣṭam patham ādhatte \|”  
Guhasena: “It is the Donkey’s theorem: No side a triangle is greater
than the sum of the other two.”  
J: “What more did his tell you about this?”  
G: “He also taught us the area of a triangle and the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya.”

J: “So, nephews, what is the sūtra for the area of a triangle given its
three sides?”  
T: “bhujayogārdhasya bhūjayogārdha-pratyeka-bhujona-ghātāt padam phalam
iti \|”  
J: “That formula is known from at least the work of the old scientist
Brahmagupta who had a mix of good and bad ideas. Guha write it down on
the board.”

G: ![A =
\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Csqrt%7B%28a%2Bb%2Bc%29%28a%2Bb-c%29%28a%2Bc-b%29%28b%2Bc-a%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

J: “Boys do you realize from that is self-evident from this that if a
triangle exists the Donkey’s theorem must be true?”  
T and G: “Yes! If any side of a triangle were greater than the sum of
the other two then by this formula the triangle cannot have an area
because what is under the square root will be negative. So the existence
of a triangle predicates the gardadbha-nyāya.”

J: “That is good. Knowing your grandfather, I am sure he gave you some
problems — he used to entertain me with such whenever we met. Were you
able to solve them?”  
T: “Yes, he gave us three. We solved one of them easily and we believe
we solved the second one but mom said our solution was not good enough
and that our grandfather might call us idiots if we show it to him.”  
J: “OK. What were they?”

the interval in which the maximal proportion of the short to the middle
side or middle to the long side fall?”  
J: “So, what did you do?”  
T: “One can see that when we have and equilateral triangle or degenerate
triangles such that ![a=0, b=1,
c=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D0%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
or ![a=1, b=1,
c=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=1;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D1%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=0;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D0%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=1;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D1%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
So, ![\\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmax%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we have one end of the interval but the other end of the interval
needed some experiments to determine.”  
G: “We can see that it should be a degenerate triangle such that from
![\\tfrac{a}{b},
\\tfrac{1-\\tfrac{a}{b}}{1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B1-%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%7D%7B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we should get the maximum. By writing out different proportions for
degenerate triangles we realized it is some number close to 0.618.”  
J: “That’s not bad nephews. You are close to the answer. What you have
to do is to get the actual number with some formal algebra. You were
right in reasoning that it should be a degenerate triangle where
![a+b=c=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Bb%3Dc%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If
![\\tfrac{a}{b}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
were to decrease from 1 such that it remains greater than
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then you come closer and closer to the lower bound of your desired
interval. But if you cross that bound then
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes greater than
![\\tfrac{a}{b}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
So your bound will be where the two are equal. Thus, you can write:
![\\tfrac{a}{b}= b;
a=b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D+b%3B+a%3Db%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
But since it is a degenerate triangle
![a=1-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
by plugging that we get the quadratic equation
![b^2+b-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5E2%2Bb-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, I have taught you how to solve those; so write the answer on the
board”  
G and T:
![b=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
J: “As you can see that number is close to what your experiment yielded.
It is known as
![\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or the conjugate Golden Ratio. Thus, as a consequence of the
gardabha-nyāya the maximal proportion of the successive sides of a
triangle always lies in the interval ![\\phi' \\le
\\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27+%5Cle+%5Cmax%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The more advance in age the more you will realized of the ubiquity of
the former bound like Indra pervading existence. Let us move on; how did
you fare with the 3rd problem?”

G and T: “Given an angle
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
construct a triangle such that its sides ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be in an arithmetic progression. We have been able to obtain a few
cases like ![1, 1,
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+1%2C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but we have been breaking our head over how to solve it generally?”  
J: “Fine. First I’ll give you the construction and then explain the
rationale. Do this construction on your tablets as I tell you:

Now check out a few examples of such triangles with this construction
and verify if we are getting what we want.”

G and T: “Aunt, that is almost like magic: how did you know this would
work?”  
J: “It is simple. You have to first bring to mind an important
generalization of the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya known as the koṭijyā-nyāya
which applies to any triangle:

![c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos(C)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%3Da%5E2%2Bb%5E2-2ab%5Ccos%28C%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Kids, you can see that if the sides are in arithmetic progression we can
write them as ![a=x-k, b=x;
c=x+k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dx-k%2C+b%3Dx%3B+c%3Dx%2Bk&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Moreover, constant of the progression
![k=b-a=c-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Db-a%3Dc-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now we apply the koṭijyā-nyāya for such a triangle:  
![c^2+b^2-2bc\\cos(A)=a^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2Bb%5E2-2bc%5Ccos%28A%29%3Da%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![(x+k)^2+x^2-2x(x+k)\\cos(A)=(x-k)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Bk%29%5E2%2Bx%5E2-2x%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29%3D%28x-k%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![x^2+2kx+k^2+x^2-2x(x+k)\\cos(A)=x^2-2kx+k^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2B2kx%2Bk%5E2%2Bx%5E2-2x%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29%3Dx%5E2-2kx%2Bk%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![2k+x-2(x+k)\\cos(A)=-2k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2Bx-2%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29%3D-2k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![4k+x=2(x+k)\\cos(A)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4k%2Bx%3D2%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![\\cos(A)=2-\\tfrac{3b}{2c}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%28A%29%3D2-%5Ctfrac%7B3b%7D%7B2c%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

That is the formula which we have expressed in the construction I just
gave you. When we are done you can figure that out and how the
koṭijyā-nyāya implies the gardabha-nyāya.”

Jhilleeka next decided to use the gardabha-nyāya to introduce her
nephews to a fundamental understanding of the conics. J: “I’m sure
Tigma’s grandfather has introduced you to the conics, the ellipse, the
parabola and the hyperbola those most important curves a person ought
have a proper understanding of. Such was a signal sent to the
yavanācārya-s by their god Apollo, who is a cognate of our Rudra.”  
T and G: “Yes we have learned to draw them and have even taught our
sister Prithika who seems to have taken a fancy for drawing ellipses.”  
J: “That is indeed an auspicious sign. Now, if I tell you that the
existence of conics are a natural consequence of the truth of the
gardabha-nyāya (triangle inequality), then would it surprise you two?”  
T and G: “That sounds very interesting. Could you please tell us more.”

J: “OK. Now consider the following problem: Given 2 points
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on the same side of a line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
when will the sum of the distances from a point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
reach a minimum. I advise you to follow along reproducing my
construction and to think about this deeply by yourself for sometime
after I’m done.”

J: “As you can see, we have point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
1) Reflect
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get
![F'\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Because it is a mirror image
![\\overline{F_1P}=\\overline{F'\_1P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
2) We thus get
![\\triangle{F'\_1PF_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27_1PF_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for which the Donkey’s theorem applies thus:
![\\overline{F'\_1P}+\\overline{F_2P} \\ge
\\overline{F'\_1F_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D+%5Cge+%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
3) Hence, as
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
moves along
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we will get
![\\min(\\overline{F'\_1P}+\\overline{F_2P})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
only then the triangle become degenerate, i.e. point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lies on the segment
![F'\_1F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can call that version of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
point
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get
![\\min(\\overline{F'\_1P}+\\overline{F_2P})=\\overline{F'\_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}=\\overline{F_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D%29%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

You can see that for any given line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
there will be only one such point
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with respect to the points ![F_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the sum
![\\overline{F_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be some constant
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which will have to be greater than the distance between ![F_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, there will be other lines like
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on which a
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will yield the same constant with respect its distances from ![F_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
So what will the total set of such points amount to?”

T: “Since we define an ellipse as the curve on which every point has the
same sum of distances from its 2 foci, these
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
should define an ellipse. Now I see how the mere existence of an ocean
of lines and points in the fabric of space automatically specify
ellipses!”  
J: “Good. So what will that collection of lines be?”  
G: “These should all be tangents to the ellipse since only one point on
the line
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also lies on the ellipse.”  
J: “Good. Also observe in the figure I’ve drawn that the angle made by
![\\overline{F_1P_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on one side is congruent to the angle made by
![\\overline{F_2P_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on the other side. As you would have learned the angles are congruent in
this way when you reflect a light ray of a mirror. Thus, you can see
that if you make a mirror with the curvature of an ellipse and place a
light source at one focus then the rays will be reflected and converge
at the other focus.

Now the two of you work out a similar case when the points
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are on opposite side of the line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, in this case we instead seek when the difference of the
distances of a point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
reaches a maximum rather than a minimum”

T: “We learned of another way writing of the Donkey’s theorem: as ![a+b
\\ge
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Bb+%5Cge+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have ![a \\ge
c-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cge+c-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If ![b \\ge
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Cge+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we write the absolute value; thus, ![a
\\ge\|c-b\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cge%7Cc-b%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If the absolute value of the difference were to be bigger than
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it would violate the Donkey’s theorem. Therefore, ![a \\ge
\|c-b\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cge+%7Cc-b%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and this is the form of the theorem we have to use to find the
solution.”  
G: “I can intuitively feel that we are headed to a hyperbola.”  
J: “That’s right but now work it out fully.”

The two worked it out with their aunt helping and after sometime
obtained the following solution on their tablets (Figure 5):  
1) Reflect Point
![F_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get
![F'\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
2) Due to the reflection,
![\\overline{F_1P}=\\overline{F'\_1P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, since ![F_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are fixed
![F'\_1F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is of fixed length.  
3) Apply the Donkey’s theorem to
![\\triangle{F'\_1PF_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27_1PF_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
![\\overline{F'\_1F_2} \\ge
\|F'\_1P-F_2P\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D+%5Cge+%7CF%27_1P-F_2P%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) The difference
![\|F'\_1P-F_2P\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CF%27_1P-F_2P%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being less than the distance between
![F'\_1,F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1%2CF_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will attain a maximum only when
![\\triangle{F'\_1PF_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27_1PF_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes degenerate and ![P, F'\_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C+F%27_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lie on the same line — let us call this unique
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and here ![\\overline{F'\_1F_2} =
\|F'\_1P_0-F_2P_0\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D+%3D+%7CF%27_1P_0-F_2P_0%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
5) By definition a hyperbola is the curve such that points on it have a
constant difference of their distances from the 2 focii. Thus, all
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that will yield a certain constant difference
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of their distances from ![F_1,
F_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will define a hyperbola and the corresponding lines will be tangents of
that hyperbola.

Jhilleeka remarked: “Here too you will notice that, as in the ellipse,
the line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
bisects the
![\\angle{F_1P_0F_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7BF_1P_0F_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).”  
G: “But aunt Jhilli what about the parabola?”  
J: “That is a good question. You may know this thing about the conics:
There are many flavors of ellipses and hyperbolas but ultimately all
parabolas and circles are the same. Imagine an ellipse and a hyperbola
with a common fixed focus and passing through a fixed point. Let the
second focus of each of them move in opposite directions towards
infinity. When the two foci of the ellipse coincide we get a circle. As
the second focus moves towards infinity the ellipse converges to a
parabola from within. As the second focus of the hyperbola moves to
infinity it converges to the parabola from without. Thus, the parabola
is a limit for both the ellipse and the hyperbola and is unique. Because
of it emerging from one of the foci going to infinity it is endlessly
open on one side and has only one axis of symmetry unlike the other two.
Hence, we need to take a slightly more complicated approach to
understand its emergence from the Donkey’s theorem. Let me show you
that.”

J: “For this we have to consider the following setup: Let there be two
lines
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and a fixed point
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For a point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
when will the signed difference of the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and to
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
reach a maximum? To work this out do this construction:

1\) Reflect point
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence,
![\\overline{FP}=\\overline{F'P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BFP%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
2) From ![F,
F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2C+F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
choose that point which is closer to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In our case (Figure 6) it is
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is fixed so is
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the distance of
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a positive constant
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) From the construction we can see that the distance of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be
![k+y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2By&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is above point
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the point of intersection of
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
a line parallel to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
through
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
When
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is below
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then its distance from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be
![k-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) Thus, the signed difference between the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(or
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
will be ![k \\pm y-
\\overline{F'P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cpm+y-+%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
5) We see that
![\\triangle{F'BP}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27BP%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a right triangle. A specific consequence of the Donkey’s theorem for
such a triangle is that the karṇa (hypotenuse) will always be longer
than the two legs. Hence, ![k \\pm y -\\overline{F'P} \<
k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cpm+y+-%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D+%3C+k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
unless
![+y=\\overline{F'P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2By%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In this instance, ![k + y -\\overline{F'P} =
k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%2B+y+-%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D+%3D+k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and it will be the maximum signed value that it can ever attain. This
will happen only when
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lies on the perpendicular dropped from
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can call this special
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

You can see that the collection of all such
![P_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on lines
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
defined by the maximal signed difference of the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will amount to a parabola. The parabola as you all know is defined as
curve such that every point on it shows the same distance from the focus
and a fixed line. You can see that the fixed line is
![d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the directrix of the parabola.”

T and G: “It is amazing that the conics are a natural consequence of
boundary conditions of the gardabha-nyāya.”  
J: “Study and think about this simple demonstration more deeply. The old
thinkers thought that certain very simple principles lay at the heart of
diverse manifestations in mathematics: For example, the soma-drinking
Nilakaṇṭha of Cerapada thought that trairāśika-nyāya and the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya pervades all astronomical calculations
(bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāyayena trairāśika-nyāyena cobhābhyāṃ sakalaṃ
graha-gaṇitaṃ vyāptam \|). Bhāskara-II expanding on what he mentioned
regarding the deva Viṣṇu states further that:

yathā bhagavatā śrī-nārāyaṇena janana-maraṇa-kleśa-apahāriṇā
nikhila-jagat-janana+eka-bījena sakala-bhuvana-bhāvanena
giri-sarit-sura-nara-asura+ādibhiḥ sva-bhedair idaṃ jagat vyāptaṃ tathā
+idam akhilam gaṇita-jātam trairāśikena vyāptam \|\|

Just as the lord Śrī-nārāyaṇa, who takes away the afflictions of birth
and death, who is the one seed that gave rise to the entire universe,
causing the manifestation of all the worlds by pervading this universe
within his own forms as mountains, rivers, gods, men, demons and the
like so also all these branches of mathematics are pervaded by the
trairāśika (i.e. the principle of proportions).

You may wonder why so much ado over something as simple as the principle
of proportions and its exaltation by comparison to Viṣṇu’s universal
manifestation taught by the pāñcarātrika-s. Nephews, I’d say that it is
not mere hyperbole nor a peculiar analogy but an intertwined metaphor of
how the origin of the universe from the root cause termed Śrī-Nārāyaṇa
according to the pāñcarātrika-s, i.e. the conjugate of Lakṣmī and Viṣṇu
is an expression of elementary mathematical principles. The principle of
proportions governs the measurement of space and existence of scale that
is the basic foundation of this universe. Likewise, the simple
gardabha-nyāya we have dwelt upon is a pervasive principle linked to the
generalization of the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya that “selects” for
particular genera of curves in space on which the foundations of physics
rest. ity alaṃ vistareṇa \|”

Consider the one dimensional maps of the form:

it will tend converge. However, the behavior is far more interesting for
![x_0\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
It turns out that in these cases the trajectory of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
exhibits chaotic behavior (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4).

Here,
![a=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and we use
![x_0=-1.464](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-1.464&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
of course all other
![x_0\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
show comparable behavior (but the choice of this for illustration
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will become clear below). The evolution is plotted after discarding the
first few values of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
While the evolution of
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
under the map is chaotic it is not entirely random. There are preferred
zones and which
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
inhabits. This can be better visualized by plotting a histogram of all
the values of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the evolution under the map for 20000 iterations.

[![floor_square01a2_hist](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a2_hist.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a2_hist.png)Figure

We can see that for any value of
![x_0\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the iterates will be quickly pushed below -1. Further, we can also see
that once a value is ![-2.5 \\le x \\le
-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-2.5+%5Cle+x+%5Cle+-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it will remain orbiting within these bounds. Thus, it settles into an
attractor in this interval. However, we observe that there is are 2
zones of exclusion in this interval. Even though we initiate the mapping
in the middle of the larger zone of exclusion (which is why we chose
![x_0=-1.464](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-1.464&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)),
we observe that
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
moves away from that zone and mostly keeps away from it. As it
oscillates between -1 and -2.5
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
repeatedly approaches the second zone of exclusion from either side but
gets repelled by it. How can we precisely determine these repellors of
the map? Those can be determined by solving the equation:

![2x^2=\\left(\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\right)^2+\\left(x-\\lfloor x
\\rfloor
\\right)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x%5E2%3D%5Cleft%28%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor+%5Cright%29%5E2%2B%5Cleft%28x-%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor+%5Cright%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We have to solve such equations piecemeal due to the discontinuity of
the ![\\lfloor x
\\rfloor](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function. Because of the interval within which the attractor lies we
have to only consider its solutions where ![\\lfloor x
\\rfloor=-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor%3D-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![\\lfloor x
\\rfloor=-3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor%3D-3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By substituting these two values of the floors in the above floor
equation we get the two quadratics
![x^2-4x-8=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-4x-8%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x^2-6x-18=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-6x-18%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
whose roots will yield the repellors. The solutions of the first are ![2
\\pm
2\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cpm+2%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since only the negative root is within interval of for our attractor, we
have one repellor as ![r_1=2 -
2\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1%3D2+-+2%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, from the second equation we get the second repellor to be
![r_2=3 -
3\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2%3D3+-+3%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These are shown as green lines in the above figures. One can see we
initiated the map close to
![r_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and saw how it was repelled. However, if ![x_0=2 - 2\\sqrt{3}, x_0=3 -
3\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D2+-+2%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2C+x_0%3D3+-+3%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
remains fixed. Thus, while ![r_1,
r_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1%2C+r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
repel
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in their vicinity they are fixed points on the map (green points).

[![floor_square01a3_ev](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a3_ev.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a3_ev.png)Figure

Here,
![a=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and we initiate the mapping with
![x_0=-0.618](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-0.618&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can see that in this case for all ![x_0 \<
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0+%3C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the iterates with be pushed below
![-\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, once ![-\\tfrac{5}{3} \\le x_n \\le
-\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Ctfrac%7B5%7D%7B3%7D+%5Cle+x_n+%5Cle+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can see that
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be trapped in an orbit within this interval. As in the above case,
in the example illustrated in Figure 3, after briefly oscillating close
to
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gets repelled away from it and that region is an exclusion zone for
![x_0\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, unlike in the above case we do not have a clear second
exclusion zone here (Figure 4).

[![floor_square01a3_hist](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a3_hist.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/floor_square01a3_hist.png)Figure
4

Instead, we see that there are repeated attempts to come close to a
certain line followed by repulsion away from it to flanking bands. As a
result we do not get the second exclusion zone but have a saddle-like
distribution around the line that is repeatedly approached. As in the
above case to identify the primary repellor and the secondary value that
behaves like a pseudo-attractor and also a repellor we need to solve the
floor equation:

![3x^2=\\left(\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\right)^2+\\left(x-\\lfloor x
\\rfloor
\\right)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3x%5E2%3D%5Cleft%28%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor+%5Cright%29%5E2%2B%5Cleft%28x-%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor+%5Cright%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Again we solve it piecemeal. This time given the interval of our
attractor ![\[-\\tfrac{5}{3},
-\\tfrac{1}{3}\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B-%5Ctfrac%7B5%7D%7B3%7D%2C+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have to consider only ![\\lfloor x \\rfloor=
-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor%3D+-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![\\lfloor x \\rfloor=
-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clfloor+x+%5Crfloor%3D+-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By substituting the first floor value in the above equation we get the
quadratic
![x^2-x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-x-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
whose solutions are ![\\phi,
-\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%2C+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden Ratio. Taking only the negative value that is in the
interval which matters for us, we get the repellor of this map to be
![r_1=\\tfrac{-1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B-1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With the next floor we get the quadratic
![x^2-2x-4=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-2x-4%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with roots ![2 \\phi,
-\\tfrac{2}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cphi%2C+-%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The second of these give us
![r_2=-\\tfrac{2}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2%3D-%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the pseudo-attractor-repellor. This pseudo-attractor-repellor is like
the superficially alluring woman who draws you but is a repellor you
when you get too close. As in the above case ![r_1,
r_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1%2C+r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are also fixed points of the map.

Finally, we can investigate the evolution of closely separated
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to see how closely they parallel each other (Figure 5).

Here we compare the evolution of
![x_0=-0.1464](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-0.1464&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x_0=-0.1465](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-0.1465&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
under the first map. We observe that while they are statistically the
same in behavior the actual trajectories rapidly diverge. This is a hall
mark of chaotic behavior.

The upasthāna ritual is performed to let the sacrificial fire remain in
residence after the primary oblations are complete. In the triple-fire
śrauta rite this is done at the āhavanīya altar with several
incantations specified in the saṃhitā-s of the Yajurveda, e.g.
Taittirīya-Saṃhitā 1.5.5. Among those incantations the following is
recited:

indhānās tvā śataṃ himā dyumantaḥ samidhīmahi ।  
vayasvanto vasyaskṛtaṃ yaśasvanto yaśaskṛtaṃ ॥  
suvīrāso adābhyam agne sapatna-dambhanaṃ varṣiṣṭhe adhi nāke ॥

Kindling you, may we kindle \[you\] in luster through a hundred snows
\[winters\].  
The strong one the maker of strength, the famous one the maker of
fame.  
With good heroes, the undeceived, O Agni, the deceiver of foes in the
highest heaven.

The Taittirīya-Saṃhitā furnishes the following brāhmaṇa passage for the
above mantra-s (In TS 1.5.7):

indhānās tvā śataṃ himā ity āha । śatāyuḥ puruṣaḥ śatendriya
āyuṣyevendriye prati tiṣṭhati । eṣā vai sūrmī karṇakāvatī । etayā ha sma
vai devā asurāṇāṃ śatatarhāṃ stṛṃhanti । yad etayā samidham ā dadhāti
vajram evaitac chataghīṃ yajamāno bhrātṛvyāya pra harati stṛtyā
achaṃbaṭkāram ।

He recites: “may we kindle \[you\] through a hundred snows \[winters\]”.
He lives a hundred years and has a hundred senses. Verily he is stable
in life and senses. This is a red-hot tube with cutting edges. By this
indeed the deva-s have struck hundreds of piercings on the asura-s. When
he takes up the fire-stick with this \[incantation\], the ritualist
hurls the śataghnī like the vajra for his enemy’s overthrow without
fail.

The text is notable in being, what to our knowledge, the earliest
mention and description of the weapon frequently encountered in the
itihāsa-s and purāṇa-s and also found in the Arthaśāstra of Viṣṇugupta
Cāṇakya. The weapon is described as being a sūrmī, which tradition holds
to be a red-hot hollow cylinder. It is described as being karṇakāvati,
i.e. with prongs or cutting edges. As its name goes, śataghnī, and from
the description of the attack by the deva-s on the asura-s in this
brāhmaṇa, it is clear that it was intended to be a weapon of “mass
destruction”. Thus, it is reminiscent of what the braḥmaṇa-s are
described as having deployed on the Egyptian Herakles by Flavius
Philostratus in his biography of Apollonius of Tyna. It is in this
context that he says that if Alexander had penetrated beyond the Vipāśā
river he might have not been able to take the fort of Indians even if he
had 10000 Achilles-es and 30000 Ajax-es with him. Given that the
itihāsa-s mention it as being used as a mechanical device for the
defense of forts it is likely that it was indeed some form a siege
engine of the early Arya-s.

For the same incantation the Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā (in MS 1.5.2.8) gives a
rather different explanation:

manor ha vai daśa jāyā āsan । daśaputrā । navaputrā । aṣṭaputrā ।
saptaputrā । ṣaṭputrā । pañcaputrā । catuṣputrā । triputrā । dviputrā ।
ekaputrā । ye nava āsan tān eka upasamakrāmat । ye aṣṭau tān dvau । ye
sapta tān trayaḥ । ye ṣaṭ tān catvāraḥ । atha vai pañca eva pañca āsan ।
tā imāḥ pañca । daśata imān pañca nirabhajan । yad eva kiṃ ca manoḥ svam
āsīt । tasmāt te vai manum eva upādhāvan । manau anāthanta । tebhya etāḥ
samidhaḥ prāyacchat । tābhir vai te tān nirādahan । tābhir enān
parābhāvayan । parā pāpmānaṃ bhātṛvyaṃ bhāvayati ya evaṃ vidvān etāḥ
samidha ādadhāti ।

Manu indeed had 10 wives. \[Respectively,\] with 10 sons, with 9 sons,
with 8 sons, with 7 sons, with 6 sons, with 5 sons, with 4 sons, with 3
sons, with 2 sons, with 1 son. The 1 son \[of the wife with 1\] joined
with the 9 sons \[of the wife with 9\]; Those of the she with 2 sons
with those of she with 8 sons; 3 sons with 7 sons; 4 sons with 6 sons.
The 5 \[of she with\] 5 remained that. They were just 5. The 10s (i.e.
50) dispossessed these 5. Now Manu had some \[possession\] of his own.
Therefore, those \[5\] indeed ran to Manu himself. The sought protection
in Manu. He gave each these fire-sticks. With those \[fire-sticks\] the
\[5 sons\] indeed burnt up those \[50\]. They defeated those \[50\]. He
who knows this and offers the fire-sticks defeats his evil enemies.

This brāhmaṇa is notable for more than one thing: We know that the
Hindus were aware of the formula for the sum of natural numbers
![1..n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1..n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the famous citation of the sage Śākapūṇi in the Bṛhaddevatā
regarding the hidden Āgneya ṛk-s associated with the “jātavedase
sunavāma…” sūkta (Ṛgveda 1.99). There he gives the sum of
1+2+3…+1000=500500. This brāhmaṇa gives the derivation of the formula
for the sum of such a series cryptically and is reminiscent of how Carl
Gauss said he computed such a sum as kid. Both brāhmaṇa-s from the two
YV saṃhitā-s importantly play on the power of the word śata (100) in the
incantation. Once Manu gives his 5 dispossessed sons the samidh-s they
are said to have beaten their 50 rival half-brothers. How does this come
about? Again it seems to rely on an arithmetic symbolism. When he gave
them the samidh-s, as the TS states that samidh makes you śatendriya.
Thus, it seems to imply that the 5 become ![5\\times 100 \>
50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5%5Ctimes+100+%3E+50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
thereby beating their half brothers.

That apart it also provides a clue regarding the origin of the story
formula of the Mahābharata. We have remarked several times before that
when old history was composed it was poured in the bottles of
preexisting myth and thereby took their shape. Thus, when we encounter
formulaic numbers like 100 (Kaurava-s) and 5 (Pāṇḍava-s) one is
immediately alerted to the use of a preexisting mythic frame. Indeed,
such a formula related to the count and the differentiation of the
Pāṇḍu-s extends beyond the Indo-Iranian horizon. In the Secret History
of the Chingizid Mongols we hear the tale of their legendary ancestress
Alan Qo’a bearing 5 sons. Notably, there too 2 of her sons are of
different father from the from other 3. A birth through a divine
non-human father is implied for 3 of them (all 5 in the case of the
Pāṇḍu-s). Further, Alan Qo’a specifically instructs her 5 sons to be
united despite their being half-brothers. So there is a hint of the need
of unity in face of conflict fraternal conflict. These motifs echo what
are seen far away in time and space in the Mahābhārata of the Hindus.
Hence, we were curious as to whether we might find earlier echoes of the
Mahābhārata story formula in earlier Indo-Āryan tradition. We believe
that the above brāhmaṇa is indeed the “essentialized” motif of fraternal
conflict featuring the number of 5 against 50 that became 5 versus ![50
\\times
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=50+%5Ctimes+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the Mahābhārata where the party of 5 prevailed in the end despite
being initially dispossessed as in this case.

Now we move on to an entirely different theme from a brāhmaṇa passage
from the Kapiṣṭhala-kaṭha-Saṃhita 35.8.

sā eṣā anuṣṭup । tasyāḥ saptākṣaram ekam pādam aṣṭākṣarāṇi trīṇi । teṣāṃ
saptānāṃ yāni trīṇi tāny aṣṭāv upayanti । tany ekādaśa । sā triṣṭup ।
yāni catvāri tāny aṣṭāv upayanti । tāni dvādaśa । sā jagatī । yāny aṣṭau
sā gāyatrī ।parā pāpmānaṃ bhātṛvyaṃ bhāvayati ya evaṃ vidvān etāḥ
samidha ādadhāti ।

There was this Anuṣṭubh. 1 of its feet had 7 syllables, the
\[remaining\] 3 had 8. Of the \[foot\] which had 7, 3 of them went to
the 8. That made 11. This was the Triṣṭubh. The \[remaining\] which were
4 \[of that foot\] went to the 8. That made 12. This was the Jagatī. The
\[remaining\] feet which had 8 \[syllables became\] the Gāyatrī
(Kapiṣṭala-kaṭha-saṃhitā 35.8).

The model being proposed here is something comparable to what we see in
evolution of nucleic acid and protein sequences. The original Anuṣṭubh

(Gāyatrī)

Of course, no surviving regular Anuṣṭubh from the earliest Vedic
tradition has a 7-syllabled final foot. So is this merely a case of
brāhmaṇa numerology or does it reflect some early development in
prosody? Now the existence of a basic 8-syllabled unit is something
mentioned early in Vedic tradition e.g. by Kurusuti Kāṇva:

vācam aṣṭāpadīm ahaṃ navasraktim ṛtaspṛśam ।  
indrāt pari tanvam mame ॥ (RV8.076.12)

An eight-\[syllable\]-footed, nine-cornered utterance, touching Ṛta  
I have measured out its body from Indra.

Being a Gāyatrī with 3 feet of
![8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
syllables each, the ṛk is testimony for what it states. Further, what is
the “nonagonal” form of the utterance? The sūkta in question is composed
as sets of tṛca-s of Gāyatrī-s. Thus each tṛca has ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
8-syllabled feet giving us the navasrakti structure the ṛṣi mentions.
Thus, we can be sure that 8 was definitely a recognized unit of the foot
from early one. Further, the very term pāda as a metrical foot has a
Iranian cognate
pa![\\delta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)a
used in the same sense. Further, πούς (poús) as used by Aristophanes
suggests that this was indeed the originally the Greek cognate of the
Vedic pāda. Thus a comparable metric foot was recognized early in
Indo-European. By comparing Sanskrit, Avestan and Greek, Martin West
proposed that there are reconstructible proto-feet of Indo-European
prosody with 8 syllables and other versions of them with 6 and 7
syllables. If this were true then the brāhmaṇa might be recalling or
reconstructing an origin mechanism wherein the shortened 7-syllabled
element fragments and merges with adjacent 8-syllabled feet to give rise
to the Triṣṭubh and Jagatī.

In any case this irregular hypothetical Anuṣṭubh is not the standard
Anuṣṭubh of Sanskrit which since the earliest Vedic record came to be of
![4 \\times
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
syllables. Indeed, this form of the Anuṣṭubh was the basis of a child’s
mathematical problem presented by Bhāskara-II in his Līlāvatīː

samānām ardha-tulyānām viṣamāṇām pṛthak pṛthak ।  
vṛttānām vada me saṃkhyām anuṣṭubh-chandasi drutam ॥

Tell me quickly what are the counts of the variations of Anuṣṭubh meter
with:  
(i) same \[configuration of feet\]  
(ii) half-equivalent \[feet\]  
(iii) dissimilar \[feet\]

Each syllable can take a short (0) or a long state (1) . If every foot
has the same configuration of 0,1 then we only have to look for
combinations of one 8-footed element. If it has half-equivalent feet the
two ![2 \\times
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
syllable configurations are the same. But we have remove all instances
where all 4 feet are same for a strict definition. Now if all feet are
dissimilar then we have 32 syllables available but we have to remove all
those where either all or a pair of feet are the same. Thus we get the
answers as:  
(i)
![2^8=256](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E8%3D256&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
(ii) ![2^{16}-2^8=
65536-256=65280](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B16%7D-2%5E8%3D+65536-256%3D65280&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
(iii)
![2^{32}-2^{16}=4294967296-65536=4294901760](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D-2%5E%7B16%7D%3D4294967296-65536%3D4294901760&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Interestingly, these numbers make an appearance in modern computing e.g.
as in 16-bit and 32 bit computing and the largest 32 bit number.

We saw a list of famous elderly people whom the virus has already placed
in the abode of Vaivasvata at the time of writing. We recognized at
least two names: (1) Robert Carroll the paleontologist, whose hard to
find book on vertebrate evolution had influenced us as a youth. (2) John
Conway, the creative mathematician, whose work influenced us in a
similar way as Hofstader, his rival in the realm of sequences.

But are we seeing the first glimmer of light at the end of tunnel? In
this note we shall look at the turning of the curve in parts of the
world beyond the root-source, the neo-empire of the “sons” of Chin Shi
Huang.

[![covid19.npluscSun.Apr.12.2020](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.npluscsun.apr_.12.2020.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.npluscsun.apr_.12.2020.png)

Figure 1: This is the daily infection curve after the first 35 cases to
date for selected countries in the
![\\log\_{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog_%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale. One can see that the worst hit countries in Europe, Italy and
Spain, are turning the curve suggesting that this round of the infection
has run its course and is flattening. France is on a similar trajectory
as the other Romance European nations but earlier in the game; however,
its curve has also probably already begun to turn. Germany too, which
was hit by a large number of cases but has had fewer deaths, has turned
the curve suggesting that they have a reasonable chance of emerging
looking better than the rest. England has done much worse than its
continental cousin and old enemy Germany. We cannot make much of its
case load because they are not testing as much. But if what we see is a
reasonably random sample they could be near a turn. England’s bigger
cousin across the pond, the US, is also showing signs of having begun
turning. India, while keeping the infection load relatively low is still
in the growth phase and it is not clear when the turn might happen.
South Korea may be seen as the control case where the curve has been
successfully flattened.

[![covid19.nplusrSun.Apr.12.2020](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.nplusrsun.apr_.12.2020.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.nplusrsun.apr_.12.2020.png)

Figure 2: This shows the rate of infection averaged over 3 days since
the first 30 cases. South Korea is the only country that has brought the
rate down successfully. India has kept a lower rate than the rest but as
of now it still seems to be growing. The European states seem to
generally cluster together and the rate plot does indicate that they
have already or have begun flattening the curve. US has also begun the
flattening process albeit at a much larger rate commensurate with it
being a bigger country with many parallel outbreaks.

Now, let us take a closer look at Italy for which was the first to be
hit in Europe and for which I was able to find detailed data made
available on GitHub by Umberto Rosini et al:

[![italy_mort.Sun.Apr.12.2020](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/italy_mort.sun_.apr_.12.2020.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/italy_mort.sun_.apr_.12.2020.png)

Figure 3. The daily progression of various disease statistics is
presented starting from 24th Feb 2020. On Mon Mar 09 2020 after a steady
increase in death rate and mortality percentage Italy went into
lock-down. The effects were first seen approximately 2 weeks later and
it took nearly 21 days for sustained flattening of the infection rate,
decline in hospitalizations, and gradual decline in death rates to be
achieved. So Italy is test case of a country with a severe epidemic
where the lock-down did do its job. A similar trend is being observed in
the other hard hit countries. So in the least this shows that the
lock-down can consistently control the epidemic and perhaps there is
light at the end of the tunnel.

Noting this we are seeing the
“[*economists*](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/04/05/the-culmination-of-galtonism-or-pandemic-days-1/)”
raise their head again saying all this shutdown is an over-reaction
after all and it is not as threatening as it was made out to be by the
“[*epidemicists*](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/04/05/the-culmination-of-galtonism-or-pandemic-days-1/)”.
Their opinion is buoyed by preliminary reports of the serological survey
coming from the Gangelt town in Germany that many of the asymptomatics
(\~15%) have developed antibodies against the virus. While we would all
be happy to be done with this thing, we should add that one can hardly
get over-confident or think that this thing is over from the above
evidence of the turning of the curve. The curve has turned because of
the logical and easily demonstrable consequence of limiting social
interaction and movement in the population and not by itself. The one
country that is for most part letting the virus run through it is
Islamic Iran and we do not have reliable information of what really has
happened to them. While entirely anecdotal, statements by their head
Ayatollah that they do not want to lock-down even if a “2 million”
Islamic Iranians die suggests that they are facing much higher tolls
than acknowledged. Indeed the figure stated by the head Ayatollah might
be close to the order of the deaths in an unmitigated epidemic.

In this regard let us consider the following:  
(1) At this stage letting up on the lock-down because the curve is
beginning to turn would simply waste all the effort that has gone in.
The case of Italy (Figure 3) shows that the climb down is a gradual one
and even after 5 weeks of lock-down things are hardly close to life as
usual.  
(2) Let us assume there are lot more asymptomatics and untested
individuals than the actual numbers. For Italy, as of writing we have:
156363 cases. It has tested 1.674% of its population at the time of
writing. Let us assume that the true infected numbers are 50 times the
detected cases: in our opinion a reasonably relaxed assumption for the
asymptomatics and those not tested (taking that Gangelt study at face
value: in reality could lower). That means ![\\approx
13\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+13%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the population of Italy has been infected. Let us next assume they
are all immune to the disease in the near future. That is a lot but
still not enough to give you the so-called herd immunity. Hence, we have
our doubts that even assuming massive under-detection Italy has reached
state of herd immunity against this virus, which would need 50-70% of
the population to be immune.  
(3) The presence of antibodies does not necessarily mean complete
immunity: we still do not have a clear idea of: (i) how protective are
these antibodies; (ii) how dependent is such immunity on infection dose;
(iii) how long this immunity lasts.  
(4) Finally, when the infections finally fall to a manageable level how
well can a country take the next step of more specific tracing and
containment of the holdouts? If that cannot be worked out, given the
above that we are likely not near herd-immunity, there is considerable
risk to at least some countries (more on this below).

All these are considerations at the gross country level but what about
more circumscribed systems like New York City? 103208 people in this
giant city of ![\\approx 8.242624 \\times
10^6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+8.242624+%5Ctimes+10%5E6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
were reported as being infected at the time of writing. That makes it
![\\approx
1.25\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1.25%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the city. Now, if they were under-testing by 50 times then the city
might be closer to herd immunity. However, given that they comprise
roughly 15% of the tests done in the US, they are likely not
under-testing by 50 times but perhaps more like 15 times. So, even in
NYC probably only about 18..20% of the population has been infected,
which is still short of herd immunity. Serological tests will tell us
how far these estimates are from the reality. In light of all this
uncertainty, as the Lebanese thinker N. N. Taleb has often pointed out,
there is much reason to be conservative and cautious, i.e., keep
over-reacting rather than the opposite in the coming days despite the
fatigue we are facing.

Now we come to some geopolitical considerations. There are some natural
systems where a parasite is mild in one host and severe in another.
These might be used by the first against the second host if they are in
a biological conflict with each other. One classic example is the
Dhole-*Sarcocystis*-herbivore system. Here, part of the population of
the dhole, a social canid found in Indian jungles, is infected by the
apicomplexan parasite *Sarcocystis* which it sheds via feces. The effect
of *Sarcocystis* in the gut of the dhole seems to be relatively mild.
However, when herbivores like hare or deer consume the fecally
contaminated plants they get infected by the parasite, which invades
their heart muscles and weakens their stamina and probably speed. This
makes them easier prey for the dholes and allows completion of the
parasite cycle. Bats harbor lots of coronaviruses and filoviruses among
others to which some of them might be immune. Bats are also social and
engaging in communal behaviors such as guarding of pups and harems. One
wonders if their partly domesticated viruses help in the warfare against
rival assemblages of bats competing for similar nesting resources or
harems.

In the current crisis it is possible that some nations have used their
relative success against the virus in a similar capacity as above. Some
hold that the Urheimat of the virus, Cīna-deśa, at first sight, might
seem to have benefited in the net from unleashing this on the world by
way of their lies and manipulation of information. However, this is not
certain for now because of their [Galtonian linkage with the
Occiden](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/02/26/the-plague-historical-biographical-and-current-a-brief-roundup/)t.
The Occident being in lock-down is no longer serving as a good market
for the Cīna-s. Further, there is at least some impetus from the
pandemic in the Occident, Japan and India to decouple from the Cīna-s.
If this goes through then the Cīna gains from this might be limited and
it could even prove detrimental for them. While the Cīna-s are trying to
use the opportunity to acquire ailing assets in Europe or Australia,
there is a concerted effort to try to limit this. Hence, their gains
remain unknown. An election result in the US presidential elections that
unseats the current ruler could, however, change this and place the
Cīna-s in an advantageous position. This can be amplified by the Cīna
assets among the left-liberals and academics in the West who are
ceaselessly batting for them as we speaking. Indeed, the removal of dogs
from the list of consumable livestock by the Cīna-s rather than being a
public health measure is a signal to these assets in the West who are
typically cynophilic in their orientation. In Europe, the relative
success of Germany might mean its even greater ascendancy in the
continent perhaps along with the German-speaking Austria — this was not
certain until recently given that they could have been badly hit by the
large number of vallūra-dasyu-s streaming in from the marusthala. Their
traditional rivals the English are also doing poorly suggesting that
they ability to limit the śūla-puruṣa-s in the near future might be
limited. But we must confess that the long-term prognostics of this
event are not entirely clear for we are hardly done with it and the
aftermath could have its own fluctuations. In Asia, so far Vietnam,
Taiwan, S. Korea and Japan have done relatively well at differing levels
and this might help them to differing degrees. The low-fertility Koreans
might not be able to gain much beyond surviving this, but the Vietnamese
and Taiwanese could benefit from any manufacturing shifts from China.
The Japanese might have shown a middling success against the Wuhan
disease but, as ever having the islands for themselves, they are
probably going to suffer economically to a lesser degree than some of
their rivals.

Finally, we come to India, which has done well in two ways: (i) It
started mitigation early with the Dillīśvara realizing the threat from
this virus early. (ii) For reasons which are not entirely clear India
has kept relatively low rate of infection (Figures 1 and 2). This has
puzzled a lot of people in the Occident, even as the traditional
constituents of the mleccha-marūmattābhisaṃdhi are hoping that Bhārāta
goes down to the virus. We routinely see that public Western
liberal/academic types egged by their iriṇavātūla friends are barely
concealing their wish for the worst to happen to India on the internet —
just ask yourself if these types would hope the same for Cīna-s,
śāntidūta-s or mūlavātūla-s. Initially, people thought it was the
weather and more recently the theory regarding the role of the BCG
vaccine has gained some traction. We are not certain of either of these
because a counter-argument can been made for both proposal based on the
countries which are doing badly.

However, we are not entirely unsympathetic towards the BCG explanation.
It reminded us of an inquiry we did with Aurvaśeyī as undergrads. She
was at that point still in the MBBS course and asked me what I thought
about something she had dug up: Albert Calmette one of the inventors of
the vaccine had noted that the mortality of children who had received
the vaccine was significantly lower first few years of their life than
that of children who had not. She pointed out that this had since been
reproduced in India, where both of us had received the vaccine. I did
not have an immediate explanation but became curious about this. We soon
dug up some information that in some places people receiving BCG even
had reduced mortality from malaria and other febrile illnesses. Other
studies have shown that BCG vaccination reduced hospitalizations from
respiratory diseases other than TB in children under 14 years. Thus, it
became clear that the BCG vaccine was activating a more general immune
response that had a broadly protective value. Hence, this can in
principle be a factor in the resistance to the Wuhan disease in India.
Our review of the BCG immunology revealed that a lot of good stuff seems
to happen upon vaccination: First, the adaptive T-cell based immune
response involving both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with
Interferon-![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
production and enhancement of anti-mycobacterial activity of macrophages
occurs. This
IFN-![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also activates B-cell based immunity via antibody generation against the
TB actinobacterium. Second, 1-2 months after BCG vaccination there is
induction long-lived memory B cells that can provide long-term TB
protection. More non-specifically, it might also induce IgG and IgA
production against other pathogens. Third, it seems to have a complex
role in regulating various immune responses, such as one hand inducing
TH1/TH17 responses to unrelated pathogens. On the other it might induce
a Treg based immunomodulation or one where activated CD4+ T cells
undergo
IFN-![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-induced
apoptosis. This could control the hypercytokinenemia seen in SARS-CoV-2
pathology — indeed BCG has shown promise in certain autoimmune
conditions. There could be other actions that we poorly understand like
the immunity-enhancing roles of *Mycobacterium indicus pranii* or
*Mycobacterium vaccae*. Indeed, we have wondered if M. vaccae might have
general health benefits that can be widely exploited further along with
a BCG vaccination.

Whatever the case, so far the basic growth of the Wuhan disease in India
is at a lower rate. However, in India it has become a weapon for
bioterrorism in the hands of the ārtanarākṣasa-s who have been the
primary cause for countering the otherwise rather effective measures of
the Lāṭanareśa. Hence, we fear this could cause the disease to fester in
the deśa because contact-tracing and enforcement of isolation is
difficult in the deśa and particularly so in the mini-Pakistans that dot
it. The śāntipravartaka-s having seen an opening could continue to use
it to their advantage even as their rākṣasotsava breaks out. However,
there are things which cannot be stated in public and if the opportunity
is seized in conjunction with mollifying the mleccha-s with
hydroxychloroquine and the like the Hindus could still come out
relatively less harmed by the pandemic. At this time it is we remain
cautious about the prognosis of the deśa and the conflict between the
opposing forces hangs in balance.

Ensconced in the apparent safety of the 4 walls the mind looks out into
the completely silent streets with hardly a soul or even a passing ratha
— a mere 120 days have made the world look and sound different. With
that realization, we place here the 3rd in this series of notes
recording these times. This note will cover some very basic stuff on
visualizing disease progression in a population which we used to explain
things to laypeople (bālabodhana).

We hear laypeople express surprise over things like: (1) “Just a few
weeks ago there were just 10s of cases of the Wuhan disease now it has
just exploded.” (2) “What is the point in staying at home? How can it
reduce the disease?” (3) “There are all these predictions of millions of
people dying and now it has come down to tens of thousand. There must be
some over-reaction due to X or Y.” As long as the person is willing to
have a patient discussion we found that we could explain the basics
relating to these using some illustrations which don’t use any
sophisticated mathematics and just a simple program which we wrote for
the purpose. One can easily reproduce similar illustrations with ones
own assumptions in whichever is the language of ones choice. When we try
to clarify point (3) we tell people that what we are showing them is not
like any of the complex models that they hear of in the news. We explain
to them, extrapolating from our simple program, that the forecasting
models have many, many ways in which they can be parameterized. We do
not know the correct values of several of these parameters and as result
of that there can be tremendous diversity of outcomes due to the
combinatorial interaction of the alternative values of parameters.
Hence, we simply cannot be certain which forecast of the model is going
to actually play out. However, the simple program does explain some of
the essential outcomes that a layperson needs to understand.

Our model for how disease can progress in a population is a very simple
one: (1) It assumes a population starting a certain fixed size
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which undergoes decrement from deaths due to infection but beyond that
there are no other factors changing its size. This simple assumption is
good enough for a fast-moving epidemic like the one we are saddled with.
In what we illustrate below
![n=40000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D40000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
(2) We initiate the disease with a single infected individual introduced
into the population and let the disease run for a certain maximum number
of time units. One can take them to be days if one wants; ![m =
25](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in our example. (3) If a person in the population catches the disease he
remains infectious for 7 days, i.e., can transmit it to someone who is
in the vicinity. Within that period the infected individuals can die
with a certain probability;
![d=.02](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D.02&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in our below illustration. (4) After that period if the person has not
died he is considered as recovered and is immune to reinfection. This
again is a reasonable assumption for a fast-moving disease. Thus, our
process features 4 states for individuals in the population: Uninfected;
Infected; Recovered; Dead. These are respectively shown in different
colors: white; brown; green; black. (5) Not every person who has gotten
the infection spreads it uniformly to others in the vicinity. Here, we
assume a power-law distribution of the capacity of an infected
individual to infect others in the vicinity in an encounter. One example
goes thus; an infected person in an encounter infects:  
0 persons 0.747475 of the times  
1 persons 0.204900 of the times  
2 persons 0.025200 of the times  
3 persons 0.008725 of the times  
4 persons 0.004550 of the times and so on till,  
124 persons 0.000025 of the times. They all add up to 1.  
This assumption captures the fact that most encounters do not actually
result in an infection but some rare people are “super-spreaders” so
they infect a large number of people in an encounter.

In its default state, people in our population randomly move at each
time unit with little restriction on movement. Infection is transmitted
with the power-law-defined frequency to
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
neighbors when they encounter an infected individual. This goes on till
the set maximum of time units
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is attained. But we can set a restriction parameter, which decides how
freely the people in the population can randomly move to encounter
others. The greater this restriction parameter the less they can move
about to bump into others.

For each run, the upper panel shows the actual numbers of the 4 states
in the population at each time unit of the simulation. The lower panels
illustrates the state of the population at each of the 25 time units as
1 dot per person, colored based on the individual’s state.

Figure 1 shows a run where there is essentially no restriction on
movement. It begins innocuously with most of the population in the
uninfected state and within 25 time units the entire population goes
through infection and ends up as recovered or dead. This helps bring
home to a layperson how the disease progresses: the initial stages
always look innocuous and how an explosion happens by exponentiation and
can overwhelm any treatment system. An analogy can also be made to a
fire: as long as there is fuel it continues to burn but as the fuel
decreases there is a down turn in the burn rate and finally the fire
ends.

Figure 2 shows a run where right from early on free-movement of the
population is somewhat restricted. Here, we see some mitigation of the
deaths and infections. Still majority of the population gets infected.

[![disease_prog3](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disease_prog3.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disease_prog3.png)

Figure 3 shows a situation where much stronger restriction is imposed on
the free movement of people. Here, a considerable fraction of the
population is uninfected, deaths are considerably reduced and the
infection can be brought to zero in the end.

The latter two scenarios illustrate to the layperson the value of early
mitigation measures in the form of restriction of social interactions or
free movement in controlling such epidemics. Of course, this is a very
simple illustration and in no way should be taken as a forecasting
model. However, as noted above forecasting models suffer from great
parametric uncertainty and a combinatorial increase in search space when
the multiplicity of alternatives are taken into account. Thus, a simple
model like this, which provides some basic qualitative understanding of
what seems puzzling to laypeople is good enough for them to get some
intuitive feel for the situation.

While many thoughts crowd our mind we have hardly felt the drive to put
them down on a more visible medium. Such is the nature of the times when
things happen reminding you of the inexorable turning of the yuga-cakra.
Though you know what is going to play out in advance, when you watch the
event unfold, and have it impinge on your life and finally open up a new
horizon of uncertainty you are left with a certain paralysis where you
are a spectator who is unable to narrate the unfolding spectacle. There
are nights when the rush of thoughts break into your hypnogogia and
there are days when you get up thinking of the steps you need to take
while heading out for the purchase of essential groceries. Then the
passing of days and weeks start to feel like a blur and all the
omissions and commissions you might have done in the preparation
knowingly or unknowingly unfold under the 20-20 vision of hindsight.
Though proximal time might feel indistinct and yuga-cakra is
ever-turning it is not often that we feel its turn like this: “vartate
vartate iti kālavādino vadanti \|”

There is no doubt that the utterly evil ways of the Chinese Communist
Party, the contra-urban food and medical customs of the Cīnaka-s, and
their questionable scientific practices are at the root of this. If
someone were to object that the second point is “racist”, all one needs
is to note the tacit admission of the CCP itself in the form of a
cosmetic ban on the bush-meat and “wet” markets. Instead of providing
proper information of the epidemic that had started in their midst they
doctored the numbers and used the WHO to spread propaganda even as they
rushed to publish crappy papers in the much sought-after scientific
tabloids to the adulation of their gullible peers in the Occident. But
history does not care and on the other side is particularly harsh to
those who despite having prior intelligence fail to take steps of
self-preservation.

As the event scrambled our existence, in the backdrop were the
progressivists who used to be convinced of the “success” of humans. In
our youth we saw them in the form of the Soviets and the socialists
inspired by them. They used to talk breathlessly about Man’s triumph
over nature and the end of the superstitions like the many gods of the
Hindus. “An unimaginative crowd” we used to think. Later, we saw their
counterparts in the academe of Krauñcadvīpa. They talked of the end of
human disease being at hand, if only a little after driverless cars.
Some spoke of the great revolution of artificial intelligence in
classifying chest X-rays or micrographs of sputum smears as the biggest
thing in medicine; others chattered about “big data” as the next savior
almost on par with the messiah whose psychosis had memetically infected
their ancestors; yet others were almost ready to celebrate the dawning
of an “Aquarian age” with personalized precision medicine ensuing from a
USB drive sequencer plugged to their smartphones. Their voices found
resonance far and wide, well beyond their political sphere. The layfolk
in my family, mouthing biological and biochemical jargon they hardly
understand, would ask me when \[insert some technical jargon here\]
would be bringing the great panacea for all humanity. Seeing my
unexcited responses or words like “Time will tell” they would cock a
barely concealed snoot as to why my work didn’t concern itself with
things which might place my name in the newspapers. The general
triumphalism apart, there as a specific type which largely saw
infectious disease as “something that mainly troubles Africans” who
needed their benign favor and was something which was mostly conquered
by the “triumph of evidence-based medicine”.

In contrast to these were those who either had some real biology
education (experience has shown us that this is not a very widespread
commodity) or those with an uncanny intuition, which again is not
necessarily common. The former know by virtue of their saṃskāra that the
battle between the viral and cellular genomes is a quintessence of life
itself and is essentially an eternal process even as our Iranic cousins
imagined the struggle between Ahura Mazdha and Angra Mainyu. Once one
gains the upper hand and then other and it goes on. Having been a
student of the work of Leigh Van Valen in our youth, followed by
investigations of our own into these matters for several years we had
come to realize that biological conflict is an inseparable feature of
life. The apparent state of conquest of infectious disease that many of
the “progressivists” saw was merely a passing phase — it was an unstable
state which could easily breakdown some day and shift to another more
dismal equilibrium. Of course we did not know when it might happen and
certainly in December of 2019 CE we had no inkling that it was at hand.

What we got was the ultimately the fruit of Galtonism, the consequence
of entanglement of China and the Occident. While seen as rivals at the
superficial level the two have had a certain symbiosis, whose early
expression was seen in Galton’s admiration for the Cīna-s and
willingness to concede to them a sphere of their own which the rapacious
Anglosphere had no intention to concede to any other people (his letter
to The Times in 1873). In turn the Cīna-s have come to intensely value
the standards set by the Occident as their own. Even as the Kauśika is
said to have sought above all the validation of the Kauṇdinya the Cīna-s
value that of their Occidental rivals. [As we noted
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/02/26/the-plague-historical-biographical-and-current-a-brief-roundup/)
when this is combined with a hunger for large lives in the Occident it
led to an intimate entanglement of the incompatibles: One sheds no tear
while gulping down a cow or a turkey, all while going apoplectic at the
other devouring a roasted dog or a cat. That coupling exploded in the
form of a virus whose invasion of Homo sapiens stems directly from this
unstated intimacy. The Galtonian spirit which has spread beyond the
Anglosphere to much of the Leukosphere was hale and bold when the
depredations of the virus were still in the distant Orient. Several in
the Western academe had in the recent years come to be recipients of the
Chinese largess — jobs, grants, pleasure trips to the Great Wall of the
father of the nation Chin Shi Huang, sometimes even sexual favors, and
above all a fulfilling validation of their hope of a rightly enacted
socialist paradise. Thus, there was an Ivy League virologist who was
shrilly decrying any sort of barrier to travel relating to the Cīna-s,
while others were enacting ritual embracing of the Cīna-s, even as a
deśi physician, signaling his imbibition of Occidental virtues, was
admonishing his listeners about their racism. But the world changed even
before people processed any of that.

Even as the virions were permeating the atmosphere in the Orient, we saw
two camps emerge in the lands distant from it. There were those who kept
telling us *ad nauseum* that the risk from the virus to the average
person was minimal or that it would fade away like SARS — after all the
virus was (almost) a boring brother of the old SARS-CoV with an even
lesser mortality rate. Some bought into the Cīna numbers and said that
it was not particularly fatal — you know 1000-3000 old people might die,
at worst a few times that of SARS. Even people whom we know personally
were telling us that it was just a “cold” or in the worst case a “flu”
or that it does not seriously affect “healthy” people. If this was one
camp, some of us belong to the opposite camp, which saw the obvious and
tried to tell them that it was not a joke and that we were actually on
the brink of the precipice. It did not matter whether we convinced them
or not for soon they had the pratyakṣa drop on their heads dragging all
of us together into house-arrest.

Even as one of these camps was rallying around Michael Levitt or
whoever, nations throughout the world were going into lock-down. In some
places like Islamic Iran, which had embraced the Cīna-s for reasons
distinct from the Occident, the true price of dependence on the Cīna-s
was brutally revealed. Even as the viral fires were ablaze in Islamic
Iran they were more bothered about taking shots at the Hindus, despite
the fact that India is one of the few nations that shows them some
sympathy (perhaps due to some vāsana of our pre-Islamic shared
ancestry). The virus was to soon knock them down, leaving them fighting
for survival. Likewise, in faraway Ecuador which was almost being
purchased by the Cīna-s corpses have been literally piling on the
streets under the unstoppable viral assault. In Europe, the Italians,
who had in the past decade gotten closer to the Cīna-s than everyone
else and signed up for latter’s imperialist Belt and Road Initiative,
were the first to be struck. As of the time of writing 1 in every 485
Italians is known to be infected by the virus (the real number is
definitely higher) and 1 in every 3937 Italians is dead from it. Then
the Spanish (while writing 1 in every \~358 Spaniard is infected) and
the French (1 in every 725 Frenchman is infected) went down to the
invasive RNA. The English and Dutch still thought life could continue as
usual but they were soon kicked into submission by the virus with
notable losses. A similar case played out in Sweden which responded
slower than its Scandinavian neighbors, showing that no nation which
ignored this virus could hold out against the punch it delivered via the
exponential function. Mysteriously, while the Germans, Austrians and
Portuguese registered a lot of infections like their neighbors, they
have had significantly fewer fatalities than the Italians or the
Spanish. The European Leukosphere was mostly defeated by the virus and
it is not over yet.

[![covid19.box.Sun.Apr.05.2020](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.box_.sun_.apr_.05.2020.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.box_.sun_.apr_.05.2020.png)

The sole superpower of the world was also dealt its worst defeat in
recent memory by the virus, exposing it as the frontier nation rather
than a complete superpower. As a frontier nation it enjoys the great
defensive moats of the Atlantic and the Pacific that separate it from
the rest of the world but the Galtonian entanglement meant that these
moats were no defense against the viral invasion. The results are
devastating — at the time of writing this one person is dying of this
Wuhan disease nearly every minute in the US and that is only going up
for now. The causes for this dismal failure of the US are many, and a
grim reminder that military superiority does not guarantee safety from a
pathogen:  
1) Even as the virions were swirling through the Eastern air the US had
ample time to prepare but smug in it narrative of exceptionalism failed
to take critical steps.  
2) Instead, its leftward political elite were lost in fighting the
emperor and trying to impeach him. For them the virus was for most part
a means of getting at their political opponents rather than a real cause
of fear. In fact they were more eager to bat for the Cīna-s than take
care of their own home.  
3) While a military superpower, as is typical of a frontier nation the
US is imminently ill-equipped to handle serious medical and natural
crises. We see this on a small scale when calamities like hurricanes or
tornadoes strike. But the generally low disease load of the North
American continent has meant that there is no pressure for a good
medical system. People pay a crushing amount for substandard care, often
by incompetent physicians. The physicians are given enormous autonomy
and power in medical decisions but they are not very responsive to the
patient’s conditions or actual needs beyond mechanical prescription of
medications and procedures. Further, many are part of a triumvirate with
the insurance companies and the drug makers as the other two nodes who
ensure that they get rich while the patient suffers. Such a system can
easily come apart when hit by something as devastating as this virus.  
4) The decentralized nature of the States with each state having its own
style of doing things can prove to be advantageous in certain
circumstances but in a situation like this it is a recipe for disaster.
While one arm of the American elite was saying how a totalitarian system
like China cannot handle this epidemic they did little
self-introspection of whether they were capable of handling it
themselves. On the other side the liberal elite, which is an antithesis
of dharma, was watching with bated breath if India might go down to the
virus while caring little to look into whether their own house was
secure.  
5) Major failure of the political leadership: at every level there were
failures in the political leadership across party lines. Politicians did
not prepare the people for the onslaught. As a frontier nation they had
little in place to ensure that all people got basic protective supplies
such as hand sanitizers, disinfectants, gloves and masks. In such an
epidemic population-wide protection is critical not just that of a few
who bought such in advance. These critical supplies were scraped by
price-gouging hoarders and others who might have even been Cīna agents
(we know for certain they did in Australia). Even today there are people
who don’t have these critical supplies. Further, several politicians
showed little will to enforce lock-downs and put an appropriate testing
plan in place.  
6) Given that they had outsourced manufacturing to the Cīna-s, key
medical equipment like ventilators or N95 mask are not available in
sufficient quantities. If the Cīna-s block raw material supply several
critical drugs could be in short supply.  
7) Failure in public medical advise and action: People were seriously
misinformed by health agencies at various levels. People were told that
the risk to them was low and they were asked to go about their lives as
usual, including attending large gatherings. Even after the risk of
cruise ships became apparent people were not advised against taking them
for while. To this date we have sick people from cruises trying to get
back home. They were told to wear masks only recently after the
infections had crossed 300000. Screening at the airports was a disaster
causing more people to congregate in close proximity in several places.
Testing was not gotten off the ground quickly with a lot of problems
ranging from faulty kits to shortfalls of RNA extraction reagents.
Importantly, proper planning to screen, sort and treat the infected
patients from those seeking other treatments or tests was not properly
managed. Here, they could have learned from the Cīna-s to set up a chain
of action where first one screens for fever, followed by a flu test,
followed by a CAT scan and finally tops it with a SARS-CoV-2 test with
those testing negative being taken out of the pipeline in each step.  
8) Social irresponsibility: far too many people took this to be a party.
Not just them but everyone around them is now paying the price.  
9) The politicians and administrators have no plan for what to do after
the lock-down is released.  
10) The above are all rather apparent to any observer and are mistakes
in part committed elsewhere in the Occident. However, there is something
more subtle which we cannot articulate fully in public. It concerns a
certain ideology which has taken deep grip of the Occidental
institutions and forcibly drives people farther from reality towards a
certain solipsism which can only be compared to the state of the New
Zealand paradise of birds before the coming of their Austronesian
butcher. We have been noticing this for while and felt that it will
result in the ultimate demise of the Anglospheric ascendancy. The
inability to properly respond to the virus in large part stems from this
— when you have a system that rewards and lavishly funds insubstantial
falsehoods as education rather than basic scientific education that
helps people understand such diseases, survivorship in face of them, the
result can be similar to what we are seeing now. Sadly, the purveyors of
this ideology are mostly well-heeled and perhaps more insulated from the
blows falling on the population. This virus may not by itself bring the
end of the system but it will definitely have reverberations that are
not going to die out anytime soon.

Finally, we come to the peculiar situation of India. While there is lot
of trade between India and China the degree of entanglement is not
exactly Galtonian. This shielded India in the initial phase of the
pandemic. However, with fires lit all over the world it was just a
matter of time before new sparks fell on India and sure they did. Now
they are being spread by the arsonist śantidūta-s supported by the
Occidental liberals even as they spread the viral infection alongside
their memetic infection. What turn it would take the coming days would
tell us.

In all this, as a good part of the world is confined within the four
walls (so much so that the earth is apparently quaking less from our
confinement), we again see the emergence of two camps. We can call one
the “economists” and the other the “epidemicists”. The “economists”
oppose the lockdown as it rather obviously demolishes the economy. The
“epidemicists” hold that there is really no way out of it for now. While
it is undeniable that most of people are losing money (us included) or
worse have no employment, there is really no alternative the
“economists” can offer. The pratyakṣa of the Cīna-s is there for all to
see. The CCP has nurtured a nation of arthasādhaka-s who value
kārṣāpaṇa-s over all else. Now if they shutdown their country then this
thing must be really bad. As we noted above, those who failed to do so
elsewhere were soon confronted with mounting deaths and overwhelming of
the medical system such that the economy could fall apart like in a
catastrophic military defeat.

Does that mean “epidemicists” like us are suggesting a perpetual
lock-down. No we all understand that there has to be a plan to restore
continuity of economic activity and the lock-down is only a means to buy
time. But you cannot really buy time unless you have a clear plan for
you are going to do next. This leaves us with tremendous uncertainty
about the future. It is not all clear if most nations have a clear plan
forward. This is especially true of countries with: 1) low social trust
due to juxtaposition of fundamentally incompatible populations; 2) those
with governmental structures which cannot quickly divide their
population into “dirty” and “clean” zones and restrict internal movement
between them. In the absence of such drastic or alternatively smart
measures we are more or less destined the let the virus ravage the
population at some rate before a significant population acquires some
kind of immunity. While this might sound alright on paper, even with low
mortality estimates it would mean a large absolute count of deaths and
long-term morbidity that would seriously limit the functioning of modern
urban systems. Indeed, a crisis like this reveals true alliances. One
can see precisely why the Hungarians have decided to invest their leader
with sweeping powers and break with their indignant fellow Europeans
neighbors. In the immediate future there are urgent production issues,
dealing with which is easier said than done: everyone needs to have good
quality masks, sufficient supply of disinfectants and the health-care
workers who are like soldiers being sent into the battlefield without
proper gear need the appropriate supplies to do their difficult jobs.
From a biological perspective the essential steps can be plainly
stated:  
First, on the prevention side, yes, the virus is highly infectious but
there needs to be better understanding of its transmission so that it
can translate to engineering solutions: 1) What is the relationship of
the probability of contracting infection to the duration and distance of
contact with an infected individual? 2) What is the fraction of
asymptomatics and how infectious are they? 3) What are the weak-points
of the virus? What are the best ways to inactivate virions on surfaces
and in the air? The final point would require a quick translation to
engineering solutions: right irradiation treatments, redoing fittings
using copper etc. This is where our modern technological achievements
can actually help in a substantial way; however, it should be kept in
mind that the engineering solutions would span an entire range from
simple things like making masks to tasks needing complex programmatic
automation.

Second, in terms of actual biology, we need to understand the immunity
against this virus. How long does protective immunity last after
exposure to the antigen? Being a coronavirus it is likely to be mostly
slow-evolving; hence, the vaccine strategy might work but on the other
hand its main cause of mortality and morbidity is from an immunological
sideshow. Hence, this could in theory place an impediment to easy
development of a safe vaccine. So, the next question is there a genetic
background that predisposes individuals towards a bad immunological
response? There is prior knowledge that natural genetic variants are
associated with predisposition to different forms of hypercytokinemia.
Whether any of these or others have a role in the hypercytokinemia
associated with the morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 needs to be investigated
on a war-footing. Finally, the an immediate step for restarting economic
activity is combining serological detection of viral exposure with the
existing RT-PCR based methods. This should be done in setups emulating
the Korean model that has been one of the few which has had a measure of
success in this war. If the protective immunity is reasonably
long-lasting then seropositive individuals can be at the forefront of
re-entering the workforce without fear and restart the frozen economy to
a degree.

There are lots of other thoughts that crowd our mind but we shall stop
here. We have not covered the geopolitical consequences or the
socio-biological factors. The latter have some important implications
and need to be seen from the viewpoint of the “public health” responses
of social arthropods such as hymenopterans and blattodeans which have
had the longest lived social systems on earth. The conclusions, while
deeply troubling to the Occidentally conditioned minds, have
considerable consequences for the emergence of disease responses in
social groups. If the gods favor us we might cover that in the future.

[![covid19.mort.Sun.Apr.05.2020](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.mort_.sun_.apr_.05.2020.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/covid19.mort_.sun_.apr_.05.2020.png)

We end with a plot of number deaths versus number of infections for
countries with over 10 deaths (names abbreviated by first 4 letters).
The lines of different colors represent 1..5% mortality rates. The
results show that not all countries have fared the same. While some of
this is from trivial stuff like amount of testing, overwhelming of the
system or plain lying, not all the differences are purely from these
factors. Hence, we need understand the underlying causes better as we go
forward.

Vidrum had called on his friends Somakhya and Lootika on a quiet
afternoon to accompany him for a climb on the trails of Vidrumavistāra
that lay beyond Viṣṭhaparvata. The fierce fighting arising from a
surprise ghazvat of the makkha-viṣaya-dānava-s had been repulsed and the
region was going through a quiet interlude. Vidrum and Lootika’s sister
Vrishchika had been kept busy by the peculiar case of the European
ambassador’s sudden klazomania. He was keen to take break from that high
drama. As they reached the plateau on the top of their trail they paused
at a megalithic circle of rocks to take in the air and chat. Vidrum:
“Somakhya, hope Lootika is treating you well.”  
Somakhya chuckled: “Ask the mahiṣī yourself if she is following the
śruti-vākya of making me the ekādaśa.”  
Lootika: “By the Ṛbhu-s, you already want to be the ekādaśa! That comes
only after something like a daśa. But Vidrum, you know I’m more rational
than any other girl I know perhaps barring my youngest sister. What more
would a man as Somakhya want from his vāvātā?”  
V: “It is interesting you say rational. That you are but you were always
rather full of prickly edges like a cactus in bloom; at least till you
left for a higher degree. That’s why I was checking with my friend about
how living with you was going, though I must say you seem more relaxed
nowadays.”  
L: “Well, you know that it is an innate tendency of women to put on a
show, often without knowing it themselves. I’d hangout with the guys
mainly to be with Somakhya and the fact the discussions in his maṇḍala
were always more interesting than those back with the girls. But there
was too much cloying attention in the male circles from others. Hence, I
had to put on that persona. Now that I’m united with my own vīra there
hardly any further need for that old veṣa.”  
V: “Well Somakhya, I have heard you say that rati-kallolādi are not the
most important objectives of such associations. You two have had a lot
of things to do together since childhood; so, I believe that keeps you
occupied.”  
S: “Vidrum, there are broadly two types of people. Those for whom the
attainment of the woman is the end it itself and those for whom
attaining their woman serves as the pathway to attain other ends which
were previously inaccessible or difficult for one or both. We belong to
the second type — the Gautamī and me have a substratum of a shared
experience on which new quests can be launched.”  
V: “It is a truism that her kids and then her parents matter more to a
woman than her mate. After all, Lootika, you had told me that is but
natural given the foundational principles of biology. So, is the second
path a superior one for continuing to get along in face of that?”  
S: “Different strokes for different men. But it is quite conceivable
that the first path results in certain: \`what next?’ situation after
the pleasures of maithuna become common-place or flounder against the
need to attend to the harsh realities of life or upon fulfillment of
their ultimate purpose. But then not all people may have the cerebral
proclivities to synergistically explore the nooks and crannies of
knowledge as Spidery and I might be inclined to do. The second path is
not an option for the people lacking such tendencies. For them the best
is to go with whatever favors gene-furtherance.”  
L: “The second path also works well when the people involved need to
have some time in their own space: like Somakhya needs his Saturday
afternoon solitude devoted to recreational mathematics, whereas I need
mine to make myself clothes and perfumes and some utilitarian things
like wickerwork. Then we can have an accentuated experience when we do
our communal activity such as astronomy or microscopy or even discussing
the results of that mathematical exploration in the evenings.”

V: “That brings me to a point that both of you have alluded in the past
that a teacher needs an appropriate student to produce knowledge. I
wonder if that aspect needs the two of you together to keep up the
motivation in your arcane pursuits?”  
L: “Yes, that secret is laid out in the upaniṣat of the Taittirīya-śruti
which describes the production of knowledge thus:  
athādhividyam \| ācāryaḥ pūrvarūpam \| antevāsy uttararūpam \| vidyā
sandhiḥ \| pravacanaṃ sandhānam \| ity adhividyam \|\|  
*Now regarding knowledge: The preceding word is the teacher; the
following word is the student; the union is knowledge; their link is
instruction. So it is regarding knowledge.*

So it is for most producers of knowledge — just as the old śaiva-s of
the Bhairava-srotas would state, Śiva cannot exist by himself. He needs
the Śakti who is like a reflective surface to reflect himself in and
that reflection is the universe. Likewise, a paramparā of knowledge
needs the synergy of individuals for it is a reflective process.”  
V: “You seem to hint something more philosophical than just plain
symbiosis.”  
S: “Yes. It goes beyond. You can have a purely transactional cooperation
as we have with our collaborators. There is no serious dimension to it
beyond barter that characterizes the process — for example, that happens
when we work we various other peoples like mleccha-s or cīna-s to get a
piece of scientific research done. But there is no deeper reflection
beyond that and nothing more to that interaction. In another battle we
might be ranged against the very same former coauthors. But the
production of knowledge needs a certain inspiration — this can come only
from a more entwined synergistic interaction across many domains of
thought — like performing kratu-s in unison. Or, our ancestors would
have likened it to the fire-drill and the fire-board. Indeed, many
producers of knowledge lose steam and eventually splutter and choke
because they lack the partners for prolonged synergistic
interactions.”  
V: “But both of you all had remarked the need to spend a phase of your
life where each acted as a lone-wolf with absolutely no contact with the
other. Indeed, you did so. I almost feared you two may never see each
other again. How does that fit in?”  
S: “A man must prove himself that he is fit for the quest he has placed
before himself. This he should do entirely on his own and even in
somewhat hostile settings. Only then he will know if he is really fit
for the battle of life. He must show that he can perform all survival
tasks while on the hunt by himself like a lone leopard or a tiger. In
our national epic we see Arjuna go on his own to seek the weapons of the
gods or Bhīmasena proceed by himself to slay Baka or Kirmīra. Thus, they
had proven themselves for the great war. Only under this test his true
capacity will be revealed. It is much like how the the great rājan of
the marāṭha-s had to kill the monstrous Afzal Khan by himself before he
could become the aindrābhiṣikta commanding a great army with many
talented generals.”  
L: “Moreover, such a solitary phase is very important for those who
practice mantra-s — it is important to shut oneself off from sexual
desires and pleasures and practice with a focused mind to achieve any
sort of success. But returning to the ways of routine life I think women
generally are in the position of choice-makers, choosing men who prove
themselves. So they would wait to see that men prove themselves.
However, if they are born in high clans there is some onus on them to
prove their svādhīnatā in certain capabilities that are not common among
the lay. Finally, I would add that a knowledge-producer needs to be like
a practitioner of yoga or tapas for a while — as the solitary wanderer
who wanders among the high peaks like Umā Haimavatī. Some remain in that
state: they need no further interaction for expanding their knowledge:
they are lone pursuers never transitioning from a leopard to a dog or a
lion, hunting by themselves for all their lives.”  
S: “That latter state is particularly common among mathematicians.”  
L: “I would even say that for most knowledge-producers, as they age,
there is a greater need for reflective interactions with those who can
play a bit of foil, unless they are very conscientious about exercising
their mental skills much like one keeps up ones body with physical
training. Thus, in the
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
tradition an old reciter who is declining can still collectively keep up
the oral tradition by co-reciting with a younger one. Together they can
reconstitute the totality of the tradition.”

V: “To summarize, you see the need to prove oneself in solitude but then
to further your greater objectives you need each other acting
synergistically, mirroring what happens with a teacher and student. But
what about transmitting it to real students? You all have gathered a
mass of knowledge across different domains of inquiry, the sciences, the
performance of rituals, darśana, the way to experience the gods and
national vision. How would you transmit all of that? Surely, your
secular students don’t get the whole package from you.”  
L: “Oh certainly not. Most of them get a very limited transmission of
our knowledge. Only those whose are closely linked to us like my sisters
or their vīra-s like Indrasena or his brother Pinakasena have complete
transmissions to the point they are mostly our samāna-s.”  
S: “Why Vidrum? You and Sharvamanyu might also consider yourselves
receivers of a limited transmission. But would you really want the full
thing? I’ve not seen you evince much interest in the entire package.”  
V: “Yes, dear friends I don’t think I’m capable of receiving the whole
thing even if I were not uninterested but I guess you would admit that
I’ve at least been a bit of a facilitator in certain domains by playing
student. But would you not want it to be transmitted in toto to others
like yourself.”  
L: “The first part we would admit…”  
S: “As for the second, it is not an easy thing. Those like Lootika’s
sisters or Indra may never be seen again in our midst — it is a rare
coincidence. Even my own jāmi-s, like Mandara or Saumanasa don’t receive
anything for they are mostly unfit vessels. Plus, resonance does not
happen with all those who possess the spark, for more often than not
they emerge as bhrātṛvya-s on whom we need to invoke Indra’s vajra.”  
L: “May be it will happen if our kids don’t regress to the mean. Even if
they do not regress in the future generations dilution and dispersal is
almost a given unless one is able to retain an institution like that of
brāhmaṇatvam that sustains over the ages. Then after some generations of
submergence the fire can shoot up again as it has done among the Bhṛgu-s
or the Gotama-s. But today the vipra-s have all but cashed their check
and others are on the path to being Rāvaṇa-s and Kumbhakarṇa-s. Hence,
it could pretty much end with us becoming samidh-s for the
noose-wielding Vaivasvata in the final iṣṭi.”

V: “That is a rather pessimistic outlook on your part! Why do you take
such a position?”  
L: “Well it is simply realism based on what has happened to others
before us. The contrast is visible when we look at other nations and the
transitions they made. If you look at the European situation, you notice
that once intellectual activity was reinitiated after the Dark Ages
brought on by the cult of Christ, there was a large body of resonant
intellectuals who could provide the reflective surface for their ace
knowledge producers. Thereafter, every now and then from among those
reflectors a new hub of production would emerge. You can see Leibniz had
others to extensively converse with on diverse matters, like Huygens,
Leeuwenhoek, Spinoza and von Tchirnhaus. From that matrix eventually an
Euler was to arise. If you look at Japan in the late 1800s of CE, you
see the great Kitasato who of his own endeavor seeking microbiological
knowledge went to Germany to study with Robert Koch. He then returned to
his homeland to found a vigorous school that continues to carry out
studies marked with great originality and good caliber. But in our midst
the schools of such towering intellectuals have invariable folded up
with them or at best after a generation or two. We hold that this is
because there is not much of a samāja beyond the founder which can
understand the pioneering and original studies to take it forward. It
may be transmitted to a select few who are inspired by the great
producer but beyond that it stagnates.”

V: “I recall Somakhya tell us in a conversation we had before you all
left about the complexity of building and sustaining institutions. Is
what just Lootika described a consequence of a purely institutional
issue or something more than that? There is a tendency among our people
to keep bitching about the lack of good institutions. That is not at all
untrue but institutions ultimately depend on people so one cannot have
institutions emerging in vacuum without people of good character. So,
what is this brahminical institution you all have talked about?”  
S: “It is indeed true that institutions arise from people and if there
are structural problems in the populace institutions may not arise
easily. But if there are good institutions then you can keep going to a
degree even with a relatively lower quality of the participants.
Further, the participants are not a constant. The population they come
from changes over the ages with selection pressures from biological
disease, memetic disease, the effects of war/genocide and gene-flow. So,
a once good stock can decline and vice versa but these things take a
long time and we are where we are after a long history of such events.
In my opinion, the issue we are talking about has relatively deep roots
going back to the time when the Ārya-s had completed their conquest of
northern India and were well-settled and well-mixed. It became apparent
to their intellectuals that situation and times no longer supported the
Ṛgveda-style spontaneous creativity but required a consolidatory
approach of the Ādhvaryava tradition. This gave rise the roots of the
tradition we term ‘brāhmaṇatvam’. In general terms, such consolidatory
traditions were probably not the unique feature of the
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)s.
Even in the times we are talking about, it was perhaps routinely
practiced among the vaṇik and the service jāti-s like the ambaṣṭha.
Across the jāti-s, it perhaps had some contribution from the mysterious
Indus people who have participated in our ancestry but about whom we
know very little beyond their extensive material productions. The basic
premise of the consolidatory approach was that great knowledge-producers
are few and far between in the then newly constituted Hindu society in
India. However, it recognized the fact that the knowledge they produced
was of great importance and needed to be preserved accurately until
another great producer could come along. Hence, the institution which
was developed was one that could accurately preserve the knowledge
created by the old preservers and transmit it to the next generation.
Thus, the focus was on creating such preservers — they might not have
been original thinkers themselves but they were smart individuals who
could apprehend the existing knowledge and transmit it faithfully to the
next generation. Every now and then a great original man would then come
along and produce the next leap because he had a good foundation of
well-preserved knowledge. However, this meant things proceeded at a slow
pace for it had to wait for what were mostly rare events. Thus, what
could have happened within a century or two of Āryabhaṭa had to wait
several centuries till the great nampūtiri-s came along in Southern
India. But even that would not have happened if the knowledge of
Āryabhaṭa had not been faithfully preserved in face of counter-currents
like Brahmagupta. However, this system fragmented due with irruptions of
the monstrous marūnmatta-s and was completely destroyed with the mleccha
conquest of Bhārata.”  
L: “One could add that complete destruction by the mleccha-s went beyond
the knowledge systems of the
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)s
and affected the other systems of transmission such as manufacture of
fabrics, high-end wickerwork and high-grade steel.”

V: “How does the minimalistic lifestyle you all follow relate to the
brahminical system you mention?”  
L: “We are not true minimalists in the sense that we keep everything at
bare minimum. As you can see from our house, we keep what we deem
important in a fairly extensive form. However, what others may think to
be important are often not important for us and are kept in a minimal
state. The aspect of
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
spirit that we adhere to in this regard is that: 1) there is no need to
acquire and display things that are meant to display status, impress
beholders and seek encomium from others; 2) there is no need to
accumulate anything that you will not use extensively. I believe this is
an retention from the ways of our mobile IE steppe ancestors.”  
V: “Ah! I can see that being a real
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is status in itself — so you guys don’t need other things. One could say
that made the
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
system quite robust…”  
S: “Systems have different kinds of properties: 1) Robustness, where it
is relatively immune destruction of its bulk elements. 2)
Anti-fragility, where it develops greater strength against future
challenges only when challenged in the first place (e.g. adaptive immune
systems of vertebrates) \[footnote 1\]. 3) Reconstructability, where the
system can reconstitute itself repeatedly in different places and
environments at different times while retaining an undiluted essence.
One could also say that that the old
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
system had a certain capacity for reconstructability due this minimalism
— they could move from place to place in Aryanizing waves by carrying
relatively little with them.”

V: “I can indeed picture the most extreme version of this — a
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of old moving with just his animals, weapons, shovel, a basin, a few
clothes and vessels. He even carries no books for he keeps his knowledge
in his head. But returning to our own times we can clearly see that
knowledge-production is a cosmopolitan one, much like cricket where some
of the most exciting games are T20 games played by cosmopolitan
multiethnic teams with no heed to their national origins. You have
yourselves participated in such multiethnic ventures in science. In
contrast, the brāhmaṇatvam you talk about is very much an intra-ethnic
affair. So do such models have any relevance at all other than a limited
transmission, as you all talk about, within your own family network.”

L: “Having worked in multi-ethnic armies of science we would still say
that ethnicity remains a major factor. While I don’t watch cricket,
unlike you guys, I know that the multiethnic teams come together due to
the quest for money — in essence they are mercenaries. Similarly, in the
past Hindu rulers, like the Marāṭha-s, deployed mleccha mercenaries who
had they own motivations and played by their own coethnic networks.
Similarly, our participation in multi-ethnic scientific armies as
mercenaries was with our own interests and motives in mind. In fact,
within those seemingly multi-ethnic scientific armies ethnicity plays a
subtle and much greater role than would be apparent to the casual
observer. Sadly, the Hindu happens to be among the most blind in this
regard due to rampant deracination. But it is strong ethnicity-based
networks that has helped certain groups prosper within the international
scientific ecosystem, such as groups of prācya-s and the mūlavātūla-s.
Further, the true belonging in this cosmopolis, which is essentially
ruled by the mleccha-s and mūlavātūla-s, is achieved by admitting and
surrendering to the precepts of the pracchanna-ekarākṣasa-mata run by
their ‘liberals’. If you do not align with it you cannot be anything
more than a mere transactional participant in that cosmopolis. Thus,
despite the impression of the cosmopolis it is merely a collection of
people who look different but think pretty much the same.”  
S: “I’d add that the cosmopolis is not a new thing. We had our own
Sanskrit cosmopolis that stretched over much of Asia before its
disruption and collapse due to the dānava-s of makkha-viṣaya. It had
participants of multiple ethnicities but unlike the mleccha-dominated
cosmopolis it did not have single dominant ideology. There were various
dominant foci such as the śaiva-s of the Bhairava- and
Saiddhāntika-srotas. In those times too, just as mleccha scientists
plagiarize our original work, we had the tāthāgata plagiarists in the
system, who despite their plagiarism, showed some prolific productivity.
There were comprehensive synthetic schools like that represented by the
Yogavāsiṣṭha among others and the emergence of encyclopedic polymaths
like king Bhojadeva. Ideas were widely exchanged, people moved from one
school to another, and there were major intellectual battles like today;
however, unlike in the mleccha-system there was no subservience to the
mleccha and mūlavātūla cores. People took ownership of the productivity
in their locales. For example, in the Indonesian, Tibetan, Chinese and
Indo-Chinese centers their own boldly distinctive local productions
emerged while never losing the connection to their Jambudvīpīya
foundations. The absence of such ownership and the enslavement or
dominance by the mleccha often leads to malpractice and plagiarism,
especially among our people.”

V: “That is rather interesting. But should we call this
knowledge-production or religious piety? After all most of the
creativity you mention seems to fit in the domain of religion or
metaphysics rather than science.”  
S: “As
![V_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)s,
we see religious and metaphysical knowledge as parts of the whole. Of
course unlike many of our more recent traditional counterparts we
privilege science greatly because any philosophy that separates itself
from science is destined to be less-effective and incomplete and there
are branches of metaphysics, which result in hairsplitting among the
uttaramīmāṁsaka-s, that do not apply to our darśana. Indeed, some of the
religious savants did contribute to our science-like philosophical
system, like Vyomaśiva-deśika the Saiddhāntika-śaiva’s work on work on
Vaiśeṣika. Moreover, I should point out that at the acme of this
cosmopolis, which came just before its abrupt end, also saw
unprecedented acceleration in the otherwise slow pace of
scientific/mathematical discovery — we see this in Udayadivākara’s
Cakravāla, Mañjula’s discovery of basics of differential calculus during
his study of the moon’s orbit, King Bhojadeva’s works and the
culmination of gola in Bhāskara-II. At one level the integration of
science with philosophy was also visible as can be seen in the synthetic
Yogavāsiṣṭha.”

V: “But the transmissions you two are talking about seem to be about
specialized knowledge – something that might be transmitted between
advanced or self-driven students. That is different from educating the
masses with basic stuff. People frequently blame our education system,
Jawaharlal Nehru and the like but is there a deeper problem of which
these are merely symptoms? Can a great institution of knowledge
production help if the student is bad in the first place?”  
L: “Of course that would not help a bad student. But as the puruṣa said
good institutions can to an extant mitigate the defects of the populace.
I believe at their zenith our knowledge production systems were capable
to doing so — this was caricatured by the grammatical fidelity of King
Bhojadeva’s woodcutter or the ladies from the 4 varṇa-s. However, the
systems that exist now are no longer capable doing so. You yourself used
to complain about the physician who graduated from a college where his
only qualification was the purse of his parents. Likewise, we have
engineers less than the worth of a palāṇḍu-guccha. Now why have we come
to such a pass – may be we can blame pūjanīya śrī Jawaharlal Nehru for
some of that. But we would say that indeed the deeper problem is the
lack of a proper knowledge-production system. If such existed, then even
though at its cutting-edge it would cater to the advanced seekers, it
will also produce as a by-product a standing crop of lesser but
competently trained individuals who can serve as teachers for the
masses. Thus, the knowledge will trickle to the masses. However, this
can happen only if, as in the now gone Hindu system, the teacher was a
respected and socially supported profession. In the system our people
have transplanted from the Occident, it is quite the reverse — they are
low-paid and hardly respected. Thus, they will seek other avenues.
Anyhow we have been chatting for long; let us get moving to reach home
in time for dinner.”

Footnote 1: a term described the Lebanese thinker N.N. Taleb

Globalization is not a new thing. The Indo-European empire of the
steppes was perhaps the first one. In addition to having a serious
component of our genetic ancestry and most of our memetic inheritance in
it, we can still see its impact worldwide. It perhaps laid the
foundations for the human global system (the idea that a world system
could exist) but there is not much that remains in terms of the precise
memory of it. However, the empire founded by Chingiz Khan and his
capable successors is still very much a part of our historical memory.
At its peak under the grandsons of Chingiz Khan it resulted in a
globalization not entirely different from modernity. The Qubilai Khan
even imagined the Phags-pa script based on the Brāhmī family as a means
to write all languages of the world. The support for paper currency, a
postal system, efficient passport control and the ability to conduct
trade through the known world under Pax Mongolica created a certain
globalization that contributed to the prosperity of the Mongol empire
and its neighbors. But concomitant with its collapse a great plague came
out of East Asia and spread westwards to destroy anywhere between 1/3 to
1/2 of Europe’s population with the trading cities in Italy being
particularly hard hit. The effects of this Black Death plague caused by
*Yersinia pestis* on Europe are widely documented but it is not entirely
clearly if it seriously affected India. There is little evidence for
such from inscriptional records even though we have documents like the
Vilāsa copper plates which record the contemporaneous destruction on the
scale of the Black Death in India caused by the śānti-dūta-s bearing the
third West Asian disease of the mind. The plague did strike India later
around the time we were locked in a life-and-death struggle for
independence from the English in 1857 CE and later after their conquest
was complete. Nevertheless, this combination of the destruction caused
by the Black Death, that spread by the throat-slicing śānti-dūta-s and
the collapse of the Mongol empire brought an end to this globalization
of the 12-1300s.

In the 11th year of our life we became interested in deciphering the
grand picture of evolutionary history of viruses. We have off and on
returned to that project to this date whenever we have had resources
with a degree of success. From that time on a more informal thought used
to run through in our head: Could a repeat of the scenario like the
Black death bubonic plague happen again? We wondered about the mleccha
use of *Bacillus anthracis* in Africa and if that might go out of hand
or if *Yersinia pestis* might gain antibiotic resistance. Such a fear
still remains as the plague outbreaks in Madagascar cause death on the
island and some AB resistant strains have been found there. However,
given antibiotics we wondered if a more likely modern scenario for such
an outbreak was a viral one. There was the excitement over HIV in those
days but it was clear that it was mostly avoidable with behavioral
corrections. The stories of the outbreaks of Lassa fever and the
Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever caused by Bunyaviruses, Marburg and
Ebola caused by filoviruses raised the possibility of such a viral
outbreak being reality. This fear came back when we were in the deśa
about 9 years ago and the Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever sent the
patient along with his nurse and doctor to the abode of Vivasvān’s son.
In another direction it also led us to thinking about whether such
highly infectious and fatal viruses might eventually evolve to
self-limit even as the Myxoma poxvirus introduced by the mleccha-s to
kill the rabbits that they had brought along to Australia. This in turn
got us interested the mathematics of the logistic map.

In our early explorations of viruses we only briefly studied the
nidoviruses in 1995 CE being largely focused on other positive-strand
RNA viruses in which we discovered multiple families of thiol
peptidases. It was at the dawn of the new millennium that we revisited
them in course of discovering a new RNA-processing enzyme in a branch of
nidoviruses known as coronaviruses. Shortly, thereafter there was a
major outbreak of a coronavirus in the form of the SARS epidemic. This
again brought to mind our old musing on a viral replay of the Black
Death plague but it mostly died out without being anything of such
proportions. However, it added the coronavirus as another candidate to
the list which was otherwise impressively populated by negative strand
RNA viruses. This was only reinforced by the Arabian disease cause by
another related clade of coronaviruses MERS. But this apparently was
just the beginning and these viruses were destined to hit the world in a
bigger way.

In what follows we give some background for a lay reader: coronaviruses
belong to a clade of RNA viruses (i.e. have RNA as their genome) known
as nidoviruses. The nidoviruses are among the RNA viruses with the
largest genomes that are currently known to us (e.g. the 31 kb genome of
the Mouse Hepatitis Virus). Their genomes appear to have grown in size
because of acquiring a proof-reading exoRNase enzyme, similar to what
cellular organisms use to proofread their DNA during replication, and
some RNA end-processing enzymes like the one we discovered. The
nidoviruses in turn belong to a vast and ancient radiation of
positive-strand RNA viruses (i.e. their genome can directly serve as a
template for translation into proteins) that are marked by a particular
type of RNA polymerase (enzyme that replicates the virus) which in turn
belongs to a vast radiation of replicative polymerase enzymes that
include those that replicate the retroviruses like HIV and also DNA in
our own cells. Thus, these viruses have their ultimate roots in an
ancient world of replicators from which all life has arise. Within the
nidovirus clade, there are viruses like: 1) *Plasmopara viticola*
nidovirus which infects an eponymous oomycete, which in turn infects the
grapevine to cause the downy mildew; 2) the *Aplysia californica*
nido-like virus which infects the eponymous slugs; 3) Yellow Head Virus
which infects arthropods like shrimps; 4) Dak Nong, Cavally and Nam Dinh
viruses which infect arthropods like mosquitoes; 5) the White Bream
Virus (WBV) which infects fishes; 6) Coronoviruses which infect mammals
and dinosaurs. 7) Toroviruses related to WBV Ateriviruses which infect
mammals. In mammals and dinosaurs these mostly cause gastrointestinal
and respiratory tract diseases.

There is some information in the public domain that gives some
misleading claims that the known coronaviruses have all diverged
relatively recently from their common ancestor: like in the past 10000
years and for the more terminal divergences in the past few centuries.
As some researchers have already pointed, out this is false. Given this
distribution of nidoviruses they are very unlikely to have the recent
divergence times, which are likely the result of the application of
wrong molecular clock assumptions to infer branching times on their
tree. Instead we think they probably have been around from early in
animal evolution with the coronavirus branch itself being over 20-30
![\\times
10^6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes+10%5E6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)Y
in age. The scenario we favor is thus: the nidoviruses first entered
vertebrates from them feeding on invertebrates like molluscs or
crustaceans. Alternatively (less likely), blood-feeding invertebrates
like mosquitoes transmitted them to vertebrates. Once in vertebrates
they have mainly transmitted through the oral and respiratory route
(that’s why latter alternative is less likely). The prevalence of
coronaviruses in bats and birds raises the possibility that these flying
vertebrates contributed to their wide dissemination with a likely early
exchange between birds and bats perhaps from shared nesting sites.

Fast forward to 2020 CE. The civil year began with the news report of a
SARS-like pneumonia disease in Wuhan, China. The first cases were
noticed in December of the earlier year. By Jan 10th it was clear that
we were seeing something big which the Cīna-s were probably covering up.
In the month that followed the Cīna cover-up and the epidemic only kept
increasing. Now, it is poised to be a pandemic. The hit to the
globalization of our age is already being seen. As of today people are
talking of breaks in the supply lines and the stocks are in a state of
volatility. A researcher mentioned in the Cell journal that it is
shaping much like the pathogen that we had imagined in our scenarios of
the replay of the Black Death plague (termed pathogen X in the report).
This pathogen is a coronavirus related to SARS dubbed SARS-CoV-2 and the
disease has been named COVID-19. The attention is shifting away from the
Cīna epicenter, perhaps much as the Cīna-s had hoped, because as of the
time of writing, the virus is now rapidly spreading in Japan, Korea,
Iran and Italy and sporadic cases are turning up throughout western
Europe bringing home the global threat it poses \[between the time we
started and finished this note a situation has unfolded at a hotel in
Tenerife and had established a bridgehead in Spain\]. Countries like the
US which despite their wealth look rather ill-prepared to handle it
hitting the country. Supposedly, the 3 Indian cases have recovered and
there are no new ones. Is this because of the increasing temperatures a
known susceptibility of the lipid-coated coronaviruses? Africa is
another strange case which despite intimate contact with the Cīna-s in
several nations has not reported much dissemination. We suspect they
might not be closely monitoring or reporting the cases and we could hear
of them in the near future (But could sub-Saharan Africans have a degree
of natural immunity?).

A serious blame for this disaster lies with Cīna-s for their cover-up.
But the Cīna cover-up comes directly from the fact that they are deeply
entangled with the Occident. Since Francis Galton the Occident has had a
certain kind of Cīna-fetish: Galton had hoped that the Cīna-s, whom he
held to be superior to the Hindoos, could be placed in Africa where they
could take over the land from the Black Africans evidently under the
benign stewardship of the English. The American component of the
Occident first used the Black Africans as slaves to get their dirty jobs
done as they lived in relative prosperity. As slavery ended and the
post-World War-2 world unfolded they need a new mechanism to lead large
lives. This mechanism was Galtonian in its conception as it shipped
skilled labor to the Cīna-s who provided the Occident with modern goods
at a low price. This in turn helped raise the Cīna-s out of poverty but
also created a serious dependency on the western consumption of finished
commodities. This dependency is entwined with their national pride and
calls for not halting production at any cost. This facilitated the
suppression of the news of the seriousness of the outbreak with outright
denial in the beginning followed by fudged numbers. With long supply
lines of the Occident and even of traditional trading partners like
India leading into the depths of China the spillover of this agent was a
given. This raises one of the biggest questions about the sustainability
of the long supply lines and argues for the value of self-contained
localism. The other side of this surfacing of the fear of the alien
which happens under such crises. During the Black Death plague various
trading and mobile communities came under attack and were massacred in
different European cities. Even with the current episode we are hearing
reports of attacks on Cīna-s in the West and even associated bystander
Hindus.

Like SARS, COVID-19 seems primarily to kills via respiratory failure.
However, going by the reports outside China, which are likely more
reliable, its mortality rate seems lower than SARS but certainly much
higher than influenza. Ironically just a few weeks back people were
saying the influenza is a bigger danger than COVID-19! In any case it
has several nasty features: 1) It seems to have a fairly long incubation
time which could go over 2 weeks. 2) It is highly infectious as the
infections on the cruise-ship docked in Japan showed. We would say it
has a higher mean
![R_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
than SARS, i.e. the mean number of individuals an infected individual
transmits the virus to. 3) Several patients are asymptomatic but appear
potentially capable of shedding and transmitting the virus. 4) It is
still not very clear if means of transmission other than through
droplets exist. This combination of features make it a rather dangerous
thing: it has all the stealth features for wide dissemination on one
hand and enough of a mortality rate to be fear-inducing on the other.

Finally, we comment on one point that ignorant or lay people often ask
us about. Is this an engineered biological warfare agent? People could
ask what about the experiments which were done several years ago on the
high mortality bird flu H5N1 to partly engineer it and partly select it
to turn it into one which transmits between mammals (ferrets). Could
such a thing have been done with SARS to get this virus. Given that we
have now spent sometime closely examining its genome and have even found
some interesting features we can say this is not the case. It is very
much a natural virus in all ways particularly close to a SARS-clade
virus that infects bats. Now a milder variant of the question is whether
it has escaped from a lab in China. The proponents of such a hypothesis
would point out that the epicenter of the epidemic, Wuhan, is a famous
center for virological research in China. Indeed, most the previously
published SARS-like coronaviruses were sequenced and published by the
lab in Wuhan. Further, in China there are incidents of the unscrupulous
consumption of lab animals after the experiments are done on them.
However, the key argument against this is that the Wuhan group published
several viral sequences in the past few years and none of them is
identical to SARS-CoV-2, even though, as mentioned above, one of them is
close. However, even this close relative could not have evolved into
SARS-CoV-2 in the lab from the time of its relatively recent isolation
given the number of substitutions in their RNA. However, one possibility
which cannot be entirely ruled out is that they had only recently
isolated this particular virus and it escaped the lab even before they
could publish its genome. However, given the timeline of their research
on SARS-like viruses this is not evident in anyway.

One could point out that the Russians have a long history of developing
biological weapons. During WW2 they deployed *Francisella tularensis*
against the Germans. Few years later while assisting the Indian smallpox
vaccination program they look a particularly virulent Indian strain to
develop smallpox weapons in Russia which apparently caused some deaths
during accidental deployment. Another case was their development of the
Marburg Virus weapon which accidentally killed one of their virologists
involved in the program. Could the Cīna-s have been doing something like
that and could this be an escape like the Russian cases? If so it would
imply considerable sophistication on part of the Cīna-s for which we do
not any evidence currently.

Whatever the cases this promises to be a serious global threat in the
coming days. We had an old fictitious story about the deployment of an
[engineered
virus](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/the-engineer-the-dead-fish-and-the-bag-of-earth/).
Something from [the last part of that tale
applies](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/06/02/the-engineer-the-dead-fish-and-the-bag-of-earth-the-end/)
to these SARS-like coronaviruses. Hopefully, with time it can see the
light of the day.

**Introduction**  
This note records an exploration that began in our youth with the simple
arithmetic question: *Sum of the squares of which pair integers yields a
perfect cube?* Some obvious cases immediately come to mind:
![2^2+2^2=2^3;
5^2+10^2=5^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E2%2B2%5E2%3D2%5E3%3B+5%5E2%2B10%5E2%3D5%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In both these cases we can see that the addition of a square the to the
square of the first number yields its cube. Hence, we can ask another
related question: *Which are the integers whose squares when added to
another perfect square yield their cubes?* In general terms the answers
to these questions are the non-trivial (i.e. where ![x, y, z \\ne
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z+%5Cne+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
solutions of the indeterminate equation:

![x^2+y^2=z^3 \\;\\;\\; (\\S

Figure 1 shows the first few solutions lying on the surface defined by
![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Due to the 8-fold symmetry we restrict ourselves to positive solutions
such that ![x \\le
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cle+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a given
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Since
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is explicitly defined by ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can study the solutions of ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by plotting ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane (Figure 2). At first sight, a mathematically naive person might
perceive only a limited order in this plot of the solutions. However, as
we shall see below, a closer examination and some algebra reveals a deep
structure.

2. Some of the more obvious structure is indicated in different colors
and is discussed below in detail.

**Solution circles, 2 square numbers and Brahmagupta’s identity**  
Some simple algebra can provide an understanding of the structure of the
solutions of ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is obvious that all solutions would be lattice points
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on circles of radius
![z^{3/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Based on this, we can determine a set of ![x, y,
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that are to solutions of ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
thus: let
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be an integer that is the sum of two perfect squares,
![z=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then,  
![\\left(m^2+n^2\\right)^3= m^6 + 3m^4n^2 + 3m^2n^4 + n^6\\\\\[6pt\]
=(m^6+2m^4n^2+m^2n^4)+(n^6+2m^2n^4+m^4n^2)\\\\\[6pt\]
=m^2(m^4+2m^2n^2+n^4)+n^2(n^4+2m^2n^2+m^4)\\\\\[6pt\]
=(m(m^2+n^2))^2+(n(m^2+n^2))^2 \\; \\; \\; (\\S
2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28m%5E2%2Bn%5E2%5Cright%29%5E3%3D+m%5E6+%2B+3m%5E4n%5E2+%2B+3m%5E2n%5E4+%2B+n%5E6%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%3D%28m%5E6%2B2m%5E4n%5E2%2Bm%5E2n%5E4%29%2B%28n%5E6%2B2m%5E2n%5E4%2Bm%5E4n%5E2%29%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%3Dm%5E2%28m%5E4%2B2m%5E2n%5E2%2Bn%5E4%29%2Bn%5E2%28n%5E4%2B2m%5E2n%5E2%2Bm%5E4%29%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%3D%28m%28m%5E2%2Bn%5E2%29%29%5E2%2B%28n%28m%5E2%2Bn%5E2%29%29%5E2+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%28%5CS+2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, if
![z=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(i.e. it is a 2 square number) ![\\S
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gives us an expression for
![z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the sum of 2 squares. Hence, the valid solutions to ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be all  
![x=m^3+n^2m\\\\\[6pt\] y=n^3+m^2n\\\\\[6pt\]
z=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dm%5E3%2Bn%5E2m%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3Dn%5E3%2Bm%5E2n%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+z%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For example, if ![z=5 =
1^2+2^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D5+%3D+1%5E2%2B2%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have ![m=1; \\;
n=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D1%3B+%5C%3B+n%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![x=1^3+2^2\\times
1=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5E3%2B2%5E2%5Ctimes+1%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![y=2^3+1^2\\times 2=
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D2%5E3%2B1%5E2%5Ctimes+2%3D+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence,
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which belong to the 2 square sequence, i.e. numbers that can be
non-trivially (i.e. one of the terms is not 0) expressed as the sum of 2
perfect squares, are valid solutions: **2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 25,
26…** The corresponding ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be derived as above. One also notices from the above expressions
that
![m^2+n^2=z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E2%2Bn%5E2%3Dz&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a common factor for ![x, y,
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in all such solutions to ![\\S
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

While this method yields ![x=5, \\; y=10, \\;
z=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D5%2C+%5C%3B+y%3D10%2C+%5C%3B+z%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we notice that the same
![z=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also yields a second pair of ![x=2,
y=11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2%2C+y%3D11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now how do we account for these additional pairs and for what values of
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
they arise?

The most obvious set of these correspond to
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being equal to special numbers such as **5, 13, 17, 29…** One notices
that these are both 2 square numbers and primes of the form
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Fermat first noticed that such primes are always 2 square numbers. This
attracted the attention of some of the greatest mathematicians like
Euler, Lagrange and Gauss, who proved it to be so by using different
methods. What is important for us is that such primes are also the
karṇā-s (hypotenuses) of primitive bhujā-koṭi-karṇā triples. Thus, we
have
![z=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the fact that they are 2 square numbers and
![z^2=a^2+b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E2%3Da%5E2%2Bb%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the fact that they are bh-k-k hypotenuses. Hence, we can write,  
![z^3=z \\cdot z^2 =(m^2+n^2)(a^2+b^2)\\\\\[6pt\] =a^2m^2 + a^2n^2 +
b^2m^2 + b^2n^2\\\\\[6pt\] =(a^2m^2 + b^2n^2 +2am \\cdot bn) + (a^2n^2 +
b^2m^2 - 2am \\cdot bn))\\\\\[6pt\] =(an-bm)^2+(am+bn)^2 \\; \\; \\;

give us the famous identities of Brahmagupta from which we get two
expressions for
![z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the sum of a pair of perfect squares when
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
prime. From ![\\S
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:  
![x =\|bm-an\| \\\\\[6pt\] y = am+bn\\\\\[6pt\] z =
m^2+n^2=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D%7Cbm-an%7C+%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y+%3D+am%2Bbn%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+z+%3D+m%5E2%2Bn%5E2%3D%5Csqrt%7Ba%5E2%2Bb%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From ![\\S

we get:

For example, if we take
![z=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we have ![m=1, \\; n= 2, \\; a=3, \\;
b=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D1%2C+%5C%3B+n%3D+2%2C+%5C%3B+a%3D3%2C+%5C%3B+b%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From first set of expressions we get ![x=\|4-6\|=2, \\;
y=3+8=11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%7C4-6%7C%3D2%2C+%5C%3B+y%3D3%2B8%3D11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the second we get ![x=\|3-8\|=5; \\; y= 6+4=
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%7C3-8%7C%3D5%3B+%5C%3B+y%3D+6%2B4%3D+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The second pair ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is equivalent to what we can get via ![\\S
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CS+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, when
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a 2 square prime its cube can be expressed as the sum of distinct two
pairs of squares.

Now, one can get a further set of
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to solutions with two pairs of ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when say
![z=2p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D2p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
prime. Here ![z^3=2p \\cdot
(2p)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E3%3D2p+%5Ccdot+%282p%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From above we can write,

![p=m^2+n^2\\\\\[6pt\] \\therefore 2p=
(m+n)^2+(m-n)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+2p%3D+%28m%2Bn%29%5E2%2B%28m-n%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Further,  
![p^2=a^2+b^2\\\\\[6pt\] \\therefore (2p)^2= (2a)^2+(2b)^2\\\\\[6pt\]
\\therefore z^3=
((m+n)^2+(m-n)^2)((2a)^2+(2b)^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2%3Da%5E2%2Bb%5E2%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%282p%29%5E2%3D+%282a%29%5E2%2B%282b%29%5E2%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+z%5E3%3D+%28%28m%2Bn%29%5E2%2B%28m-n%29%5E2%29%28%282a%29%5E2%2B%282b%29%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, from Brahmagupta’s identity we have:  
![x = 2a(m+n)-\|2b(m-n)\|\\\\\[6pt\] y =
2b(m+n)+\|2a(m-n)\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+2a%28m%2Bn%29-%7C2b%28m-n%29%7C%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y+%3D+2b%28m%2Bn%29%2B%7C2a%28m-n%29%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Alternatively,  
![x=2a(m+n)+\|2b(m-n)\|\\\\\[6pt\]
y=2b(m+n)-\|2a(m-n)\|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2a%28m%2Bn%29%2B%7C2b%28m-n%29%7C%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D2b%28m%2Bn%29-%7C2a%28m-n%29%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For example, if ![z=26= 2 \\times
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D26%3D+2+%5Ctimes+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then ![m=2, \\; n=3, \\; a=5, \\;
b=12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2%2C+%5C%3B+n%3D3%2C+%5C%3B+a%3D5%2C+%5C%3B+b%3D12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![x=74, \\;
y=110](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D74%2C+%5C%3B+y%3D110&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![x=26, \\;
y=130](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D26%2C+%5C%3B+y%3D130&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, one can derive formulae for ![z=4p,
8p...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D4p%2C+8p...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

When ![z=p^2
=a^2+b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dp%5E2+%3Da%5E2%2Bb%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![p=m^2+n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3Dm%5E2%2Bn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(2 square) prime we can show via repeated application of Brahmagupta’s
identity that there 3 possible
![x,y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pairs whose squares can compose
![z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can derive the below formulae for them:  
![x=a^3+b^2a\\\\\[6pt\]
y=b^3+a^2b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Da%5E3%2Bb%5E2a%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3Db%5E3%2Ba%5E2b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Or,  
![x=p(a^2-b^2)\\\\\[6pt\]
y=2pab](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dp%28a%5E2-b%5E2%29%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D2pab&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Or,  
![x= \|m (b^2 n + 2 a b m - a^2 n ) - n \| a^2m + 2 ab n - b^2 mb\| \|
\\\\\[6pt\] y= (a m - a n + b m + b n) (a m + a n - b m + b
n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+%7Cm+%28b%5E2+n+%2B+2+a+b+m+-+a%5E2+n+%29+-+n+%7C+a%5E2m+%2B+2+ab+n+-+b%5E2+mb%7C+%7C+%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D+%28a+m+-+a+n+%2B+b+m+%2B+b+n%29+%28a+m+%2B+a+n+-+b+m+%2B+b+n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

As an example, by applying the above formulae we can see that for ![z=25
=
5^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D25+%3D+5%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
its cube,
![25^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=25%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
can be split up into 3 distinct pairs of squares: ![35^2+120^2 = 44^2 +
117^2 = 75^2
+100^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=35%5E2%2B120%5E2+%3D+44%5E2+%2B+117%5E2+%3D+75%5E2+%2B100%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The nested combinatorial application of Brahmagupta’s formula can thus
result in increasingly complex formations with multiple alternative
partitions of a perfect cube into perfect squares for different
multiples of the 2 square primes. Thus if ![z=50=2 \\times
p^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D50%3D2+%5Ctimes+p%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get 4 distinct pairs of ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
for ![z=125= 5 \\times
5^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D125%3D+5+%5Ctimes+5%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get 5 distinct pairs of ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

When a number is product of two distinct
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
primes then its cube can be partitioned into 8 distinct pairs perfect
squares. For instance,  
![65^3= 7^2 + 524^2 = 65^2+ 520^2 = 140^2 + 505^2 = 191^2 + 488^2= 208^2
+ 481^2 = 260^2+ 455^2= 320^2+ 415^2 = 364^2+
377^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=65%5E3%3D+7%5E2+%2B+524%5E2+%3D+65%5E2%2B+520%5E2+%3D+140%5E2+%2B+505%5E2+%3D+191%5E2+%2B+488%5E2%3D+208%5E2+%2B+481%5E2+%3D+260%5E2%2B+455%5E2%3D+320%5E2%2B+415%5E2+%3D+364%5E2%2B+377%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
The same applies to the multiples of these numbers by 2, 4… When a
number is a product of a
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
prime and the square of a distinct
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
prime then the cube of that number can be partitioned into 14 different
pairs of perfect squares. Thus, ![325=5^2 \\times
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=325%3D5%5E2+%5Ctimes+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the first number whose cube can be thus partitioned. The next is
![425 = 5^2 \\times
17](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=425+%3D+5%5E2+%5Ctimes+17&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Figure 3 shows some circles with multiple pairs of ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
whose squares sum to the same
![z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Ramanujan and Landau had independently discovered that the number of
positive integers, ![N(x) \\le
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%28x%29+%5Cle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
that can be written as a sum of 2 squares including 0 defines a
constant:

![\\displaystyle K\_{RL} = \\lim\_{x \\to \\infty}
N(x)\\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\log(x)}}{x} =
0.7642236535...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+K_%7BRL%7D+%3D+%5Clim_%7Bx+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+N%28x%29%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Clog%28x%29%7D%7D%7Bx%7D+%3D+0.7642236535...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Based on this, we can also look at how many unique ![z \\le
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%5Cle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![N(z)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%28z%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by defining:

![K=N(z)\\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\log(x)}}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%3DN%28z%29%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Clog%28x%29%7D%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We empirically observe that this ![K \\approx
0.8071](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K+%5Capprox+0.8071&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4). The
![K\_{RL}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7BRL%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has a closed form which has deep connections to the Riemann
![\\zeta(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Czeta%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the Dirichlet
![\\beta(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, we are not aware of a closed form for the constant
![K](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in our case or even its exact value as ![x \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This
![K](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
seems to reach a fairly stable value around that reported above but
![K\_{RL}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7BRL%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converges very slowly.

**Solution families on curves**  
In addition to the arrangement of solutions as lattice points on circle
of radius
![z^{3/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
there are also other patterns that become apparent from a closer look at
the solutions in the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane (Figure 2). The most obvious is the set of points lying on the
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
line at the right diagonal boundary of the plot. These are defined by a
family of the form:

![x= y =2n^3; \\; z=
2n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+y+%3D2n%5E3%3B+%5C%3B+z%3D+2n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This family defines the sequence of integers twice whose square equals a
perfect cube: **2, 16, 54, 128, 250, 432, 686, 1024 …** (blue line in
Figure 3).

Then we see pairs of regularly positioned points that eventually lie
closer to the right diagonal boundary (emphasized in red and blue in
Figure 3). These are families that lie on one of two parallel curves.
The first is defined by the parametric equations:

![x = 2t^3 + 6t^2 + 3t - 2 \\\\\[6pt\] y = 2t^3 + 12t^2 + 21t +
11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+2t%5E3+%2B+6t%5E2+%2B+3t+-+2+%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y+%3D+2t%5E3+%2B+12t%5E2+%2B+21t+%2B+11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This curve has a lobe (Figure 5; gray) and generally resembles the shape
of the curve of von Tschirnhaus (see below). The second curve takes the
form:

![x=2t^3+6t^2+9t\\\\\[6pt\]
y=2t^3+12t^2+27t+27](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2t%5E3%2B6t%5E2%2B9t%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D2t%5E3%2B12t%5E2%2B27t%2B27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This curve has no lobe and lies inside the divergent arms of the first
one (Figure 5; dark orange).

[![sqrs_cube_xyz_Fig5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/sqrs_cube_xyz_fig5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/sqrs_cube_xyz_fig5.png)Figure
5

A further family lies on the curve defined by the below parametric
equations (emphasized in red in Figure 3):

![x=3t^2-1\\\\\[6pt\]
y=t^3-3t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3t%5E2-1%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3Dt%5E3-3t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This curve has a single lobe and two divergent arms (Figure 5, light
orange) and is a version of the eponymous curve discovered by Ehrenfried
Walther von Tschirnhaus, the famous German polymath, who among other
things reinvented porcelain in the Occident. It crosses over the above
two curves and proceeds closer to the vertical left boundary of the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plot.

Finally, we a family of families lying on the family of curves (shown in
blue in Figures 3, 5) defined by the parametric equations:

![x=kt^2 + k^3\\\\\[6pt\] y= t^3 +
k^2t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dkt%5E2+%2B+k%5E3%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D+t%5E3+%2B+k%5E2t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),  
where ![k=1, 2, 3
...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1%2C+2%2C+3+...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The first member of each of the new families on this family of curves
starts from where the curve intersect the
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
line. Thus, each starts with the points
![x=y=2k^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dy%3D2k%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3). The first of this gives yields the answer to the second
question posed in the introduction. When the square of
![x=n^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dn%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is added to the square of
![y=n^3+n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dn%5E3%2Bn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the cube of
![z=n^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dn%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![x=z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dz&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It remains unknown to us if there are any further families beyond these.

**Introduction**  
In our part of the world, someone with even a nominal knowledge of
mathematics might be aware of the taxicab number made famous by the
conversation of Ramanujan and Hardy: the smallest number that can be
expressed as the sum of two distinct pairs positive cubes: ![1729=1^3 +
12^3 = 9^3 +
10^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1729%3D1%5E3+%2B+12%5E3+%3D+9%5E3+%2B+10%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This number is just one of a family of such taxicab numbers with deep
connections to other objects in the mathematical world that were
discovered by Ramanujan long before anyone knew of their significance.
There are several other interesting questions, which, in a similar vein,
relate to the sum and difference of cubes. From Fermat’s last theorem we
know that the indeterminate equation
![x^3+y^3=z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3Dz%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cannot have any non-trivial integer solutions (non-trivial being where
none of the solutions are 0). However, this still leaves open other
possibilities with sums of 3 cubes and differences of the cubes and the
like. For example, one popular and widely investigated one asks which
integers can be expressed as a sum of any three cubes. When we learned
that Fermat’s last theorem precludes integer solutions for
![x^3+y^3=z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3Dz%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in our early youth, we wondered if there are non-trivial positive
integer solutions indeterminate equation:
![x^3+y^3+z^3=w^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%2Bz%5E3%3Dw%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Soon we became interested and investigated one specific version of it of
the form:

![x^3+y^3=w^3-z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3Dw%5E3-z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![w=z+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Dz%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus, we have ![x^3+y^3=3z^2+3z+1 \\;\\;\\; (\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3D3z%5E2%2B3z%2B1+%5C%3B%5C%3B%5C%3B+%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This led us to discovering and proving for ourselves a simple arithmetic
theorem concerning such cubes. Later, we read to our amazement that a
related problem had been considered on a Japanese temple tablet in a
beautiful “mystical”-sounding verse and solved in a commentary on it.
This inspired us to look at the problem again and we discovered further
interesting links between conics and these cubes. We detail these
explorations and the Japanese temple tablet below.

**The difference of consecutive cubes and an arithmetic theorem**  
We first asked when does the difference of consecutive cubes result in a
sum of two cubes. This idea came to us as a parallel to the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa triples. While we have 4 cubes in ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
given that two are consecutive, we only have a triple of distinct
positive integers ![x, y,
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
bearing the relationship:

![z = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{12x^3 + 12y^3 - 3} -3}{6} \\; \\; \\; (\\S
2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B12x%5E3+%2B+12y%5E3+-+3%7D+-3%7D%7B6%7D+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%28%5CS+2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we have to search for the all the cases where ![(\\S

evaluates to an integer given dyads of positive integers ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If we order the resultant triples such that ![x \< y \<
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3C+y+%3C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get a unique set of triples, e.g. 1, 6, 8:
![1^3+6^3=9^3-8^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5E3%2B6%5E3%3D9%5E3-8%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

for all ![x,

a total of 1173 triples.

The plot initially reminds one of a first time observer of the sky with
a great mass of stellar points with some vague patterns among them.
Given that
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is dependent on ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the points lie on a single curved surface in 3D, we can reduce
dimensions for simplicity and plot just ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2).

2.

As we have ordered our triples ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
all points obviously lie above the
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
line. We then notice the first clear pattern. There are set of regularly
arranged points (in red in Figure 2) that mark the left margin of the
plot. These points lead us to the following theorem:

**The cube of every positive integer is equal to the difference of the
cubes of two consecutive positive integers minus the cube a third
positive integer.**

To prove this let us consider those regularly arranged points. The first
few of them are tabulated below:

|   x |   y |
|----:|----:|
|   1 |   6 |
|   2 |  17 |
|   3 |  34 |
|   4 |  57 |
|   5 |  86 |
|   6 | 121 |

We observe that the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values of these points include each positive integer in order. The
corresponding
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grows rapidly and follows a peculiar pattern. This pattern is
represented by the numbers lying on the 5th spoke hexagonal spiral
(Figure 3) where 6 spokes separated by the rotation angle of
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
radians pass through the origin.

[![cube.diffspiral_fig3](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/cube.diffspiral_fig3.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/cube.diffspiral_fig3.png)

Figure 3.

The numbers lying on the 5th spoke of this spiral can be represented by
the formula:
![3n^2+2n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3n%5E2%2B2n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we have ![x=1, 2,
3...n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the corresponding
![y=3n^2+2n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D3n%5E2%2B2n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence,

![x^3+y^3=n^3+(3n^2+2n+1)^3= 3(3n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n)^2 + 3 (3n^3 + 3n^2 +
2n) + 1 \\;\\;\\; (\\S

If we write ![z=3n^3 + 3n^2 +
2n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D3n%5E3+%2B+3n%5E2+%2B+2n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the right hand side of ![(\\S
3)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+3%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes
![(z+1)^3-z^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28z%2B1%29%5E3-z%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore

Thus, this theorem illustrates one deep connection between the cubes of
numbers the hexagonal number spiral.

**The Japanese temple tablet**  
The Samurai intellectual Shiraishi Chochu recorded a problem inscribed
in tablet hung at a temple in the 1800s by the poorly known
mathematician Gokai Ampon:

*“There are three integral numbers, heaven, earth, and man, which being
cubed and added together give a result of which the cube root has no
decimal part. Required to find the numbers.”* – translation from Smith
and Mikami

In essence, Gokai Ampon wants us to find integer solutions to
indeterminate equation
![x^3+y^3+z^3=w^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%2Bz%5E3%3Dw%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is the same question that had originally prompted our quest. His
solutions recorded by Shiraishi Chochu are a particular class of
solutions to
![x^3+y^3=3z^2+3z+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3D3z%5E2%2B3z%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the sum of the cubes of two positive integer being the difference
of the cubes of consecutive positive integers.

If we look at Figure 2, we find that among the mass of points with
apparently no discernible order there are a group of regularly arranged
points coming in pairs with the same
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
value and lying on a slim parabola (colored purple). It was this group
of points that caught Gokai Ampon’s attention. The first few of the
pairs are listed below:

|   x |  y₁ |  y₂ |
|----:|----:|----:|
|   3 |   4 |  10 |
|  12 |  19 |  31 |
|  27 |  46 |  64 |
|  48 |  85 | 109 |
|  75 | 136 | 166 |
| 108 | 199 | 235 |

We observe that for these points
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
takes the form ![3n^2; \\; n=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3n%5E2%3B+%5C%3B+n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For
![y_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get a fit with ![6n^2 -3n
+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%5E2+-3n+%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and for
![y_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with ![6n^2 +3n
+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%5E2+%2B3n+%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, with
![y_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have:

![x^3+y_1^3=(3n^2)^3+(6n^2 -3n +1)^3 = 3 \\cdot 3^2(2 n^2-3 n^3 - n)^2 +
3 \\cdot 3 (2 n^2-3 n^3 - n) + 1 \\;\\;\\; (\\S

By writing ![z_1=3(2 n^2-3 n^3 -
n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_1%3D3%282+n%5E2-3+n%5E3+-+n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and plugging it in ![(\\S
4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![x^3+y_1^3+z_1^3=
(z_1+1)^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By_1%5E3%2Bz_1%5E3%3D+%28z_1%2B1%29%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is a family of valid solutions to the Japanese problem. Given that
we are only considering positive integers, the final parameterization
will be ![z_1=3(3 n^3- 2 n^2+
n)-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_1%3D3%283+n%5E3-+2+n%5E2%2B+n%29-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, with
![y_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:

![x^3+y_2^3=(3n^2)^3+(6n^2 +3n +1)^3 = 3 \\cdot 3^2 (3 n^3 + 2 n^2 +
n)^2 + 3 \\cdot 3 (3 n^3 + 2 n^2 + n) + 1 \\;\\;\\; (\\S

By plugging ![z_2= 3 (3 n^3 + 2 n^2 +
n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_2%3D+3+%283+n%5E3+%2B+2+n%5E2+%2B+n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in ![(\\S
5)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+5%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![x^3+y_1^3+z_2^3=
(z_2+1)^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By_1%5E3%2Bz_2%5E3%3D+%28z_2%2B1%29%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the second valid family of valid solutions to the Japanese problem.

One can see that these two solutions are lattice points on a parabola
whose parametric equation is ![(x=3t^2, y=6t^2 \\pm 3t
+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D3t%5E2%2C+y%3D6t%5E2+%5Cpm+3t+%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, both our solution which covers the cubes of every positive integer
and the Japanese solutions are 2 distinct parameterized families
corresponding to parabolas in the
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plane.

**The elliptical families**  
When we learned of the Japanese solutions, we wondered if there might be
any other families of solutions hidden within the apparent disorder of
the total set of all solutions. Returning to the
![x-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
plot, we noted that several points lie on arcs of increasing size (shown
as orange and pink points in Figure 2). Examining these, we discovered
that they are integer points lying on pairs of related ellipses of
eccentricity
![\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that have equations of the form:

![\\begin{cases} x^2-xy+y^2-ax-by+c=0 \\\\\[6pt\] x^2-xy+y^2-bx-ay+c=0
\\end{cases} \\; \\; \\; (\\S

Where the 3 parameters ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are defined by:

![c=27u^4+9u^2+1\\\\\[6pt\] a=c+(9u^2+1) = 27u^4 + 18u^2 + 2\\\\\[6pt\]

The lattice points of ![(\\S

and the number of solutions they yield on the 2 corresponding ellipses
are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1.

The ellipses first corresponding to the few values of

are show in Figure 5. Not all values of
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are equally rich in terms of solutions for ![(\\S

The integers (1, 2, 3…), thirds i.e. ![n \\pm
\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cpm+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
consistently yield solutions but the integers tend to be clearly richer
than the thirds (Figure 4). Other than integers, certain irrational
values of the form
![u=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{6n+1}{6}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B6n%2B1%7D%7B6%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are particularly rich in solutions. Other than those,
![u=\\sqrt{12}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D%5Csqrt%7B12%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and certain values of the form ![u=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{6n+1}{18}}, u=
\\sqrt{\\tfrac{6n+2}{18}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B6n%2B1%7D%7B18%7D%7D%2C+u%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B6n%2B2%7D%7B18%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are also rich in solutions. Thus, ![12a, 12b,
12c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12a%2C+12b%2C+12c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are integers for all
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
yielding solutions lying on ellipses. However, it remains unclear if
there is a general rule to determine which of the quadratic surds that
take the above forms will be
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that yield solutions for ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In any case the given that integer
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yield solutions for ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that lie on defined ellipses the family of such elliptical solutions is
infinite.

Finally, we may note one special feature of the family of elliptical
solutions that are specifically associated with the integer values of
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Given that the solutions ![x, y,
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
define a simple curved surface (Figure 1), i.e. the surface does not
show any folding, there can utmost be 2 pairs of ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that yield the same
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
There are 29
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which can be derived from 2 distinct pairs of ![x, y\<
20000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%3C+20000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example: ![9^3+ 58^3= 22^3 +
57^3=256^3-255^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=9%5E3%2B+58%5E3%3D+22%5E3+%2B+57%5E3%3D256%5E3-255%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, (9, 58) and (22, 57) form a pair that yield the same
![z=255](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D255&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The majority of such pairs of solutions with the same
![z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lie on the ellipses arising from integer
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, each such ellipse contains a pair whose whose
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values are respectively defined by ![x_1 =9u^3; x_2=
9u^3+9u^2+3u+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%3D9u%5E3%3B+x_2%3D+9u%5E3%2B9u%5E2%2B3u%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The corresponding
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values can be obtained by plugging
![x_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
into the second ellipse and
![x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
into the first ellipse in ![(\\S
6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Thus we get ![y_1= 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n + 1; y_2=27n^4 + 18n^3 +
9n^2 +
3n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3D+27n%5E4+%2B+18n%5E3+%2B+9n%5E2+%2B+3n+%2B+1%3B+y_2%3D27n%5E4+%2B+18n%5E3+%2B+9n%5E2+%2B+3n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus, for these cases
![y_1=y_2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3Dy_2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These pairs are shown below for ![u=1, 2, 3,
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Thus, these paired values define an infinite family by themselves lying
on in the curves defined by the below parametric equations (Figure 5,
blue curve):

![\\begin{cases} x= 9t^3\\\\\[6pt\] y= 27t^4 + 18t^3 + 9t^2 + 3t + 1
\\end{cases}\\\\\[10pt\] \\begin{cases} x=9t^3+9t^2+3t+1\\\\\[6pt\]
y=27t^4 + 18t^3 + 9t^2 + 3t
\\end{cases}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+x%3D+9t%5E3%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D+27t%5E4+%2B+18t%5E3+%2B+9t%5E2+%2B+3t+%2B+1+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+x%3D9t%5E3%2B9t%5E2%2B3t%2B1%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D27t%5E4+%2B+18t%5E3+%2B+9t%5E2+%2B+3t+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

There are a minority of pairs which lie outside of the ellipses. We do
not know as yet if they define any other families of solutions. More
generally, it is also not clear if there are any other families of
solutions beyond the above parabolic and elliptical families.

**Sum of cubes of 2 positive integers that equal the difference of cubes
successive same-parity positive integers**  
In this final section we shall briefly consider a related indeterminate
equation:

![x^3+y^3=(z+2)^3-z^3=6z^2+12z+8 \\; \\; \\; (\\S
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2By%5E3%3D%28z%2B2%29%5E3-z%5E3%3D6z%5E2%2B12z%2B8+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%28%5CS+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One can see right away that some of the regular families of solutions of
![(\\S
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are related to those of ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The first relates to the above theorem regarding the cubes of every
positive integer. In this case the equivalent is:

**The cube of every positive even number is equal to the difference of
the cubes of two consecutive even numbers minus the cube of another even
number.**

These correspond to the solutions to ![(\\S
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the form ![(x=2n, y= 6n^2 + 4n +
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D2n%2C+y%3D+6n%5E2+%2B+4n+%2B+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6, violet curve). Further, the equivalents of the solutions to
Gokai Ampon’s points in this case lie on the parabola defined by the
parametric equation: ![(x=6t^2, 12t^2 - 6t +
2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%3D6t%5E2%2C+12t%5E2+-+6t+%2B+2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6, purple curve). However, the solutions to ![(\\S
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
feature a unique parabolic family of solutions with no equivalent among
the solutions of ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These lie on the parabola defined by the parametric equation: ![(3t^2 -
t + 1, 3t^2 + t +
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283t%5E2+-+t+%2B+1%2C+3t%5E2+%2B+t+%2B+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6, orange curve). These correspond to ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such as:  
(3, 5); (11, 15) (25, 31) (45, 53)… Thus, ![x=3n^2 - n +
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3n%5E2+-+n+%2B+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![y=3n^2 + n +
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D3n%5E2+%2B+n+%2B+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
provide another link to the hexagonal number spiral as they correspond
to numbers that respectively lie on its 2nd and 4th spoke (Figure 3).
With this in hand, we can show that for these ![x,
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
give rise to ![z=3 n^3 + 2 n -
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D3+n%5E3+%2B+2+n+-+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which defines the sequence: **4, 27, 86, 199, 384, 659, 1042…**

As with the solutions to ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
here too we have the equivalent elliptical families corresponding to the
integer lattice points on ellipses of eccentricity
![\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that have equations of the form:

![x^2-xy+y^2-ax-by+c=0 \\\\\[6pt\]
x^2-xy+y^2-bx-ay+c=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-xy%2By%5E2-ax-by%2Bc%3D0+%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+x%5E2-xy%2By%5E2-bx-ay%2Bc%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here the 3 parameters ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are defined by:

![a=54u^4 + 36u^2 + 4\\\\\[6pt\] b=54u^4 - 2\\\\\[6pt\] c=108u^4 + 36u^2
+
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D54u%5E4+%2B+36u%5E2+%2B+4%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+b%3D54u%5E4+-+2%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+c%3D108u%5E4+%2B+36u%5E2+%2B+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

However, the
![u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which yield elliptical solutions for ![(\\S
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are the same as those that yield solutions for ![(\\S
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CS+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and there is an equivalence in the corresponding solutions. Figure 6
shows a few elliptical solutions ![\\left(u=2, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{37}{3}},
\\tfrac{\\sqrt{73}}{3},
3\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28u%3D2%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B37%7D%7B3%7D%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B73%7D%7D%7B3%7D%2C+3%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

In conclusion, this exploration reveals connections between a certain
class of cubic indeterminate equations and families of solutions defined
by particular parabolas and ellipses. It is not known to us if any one
previously studied these elliptical families or reported any other
families beyond those considered here.

What is presented below will be elementary for someone with even just
the mastery of secondary school mathematics. Nevertheless, even simple
stuff might present points of interest to people who see beauty in such
things. Consider the following question:

Given the first 2 terms ![0 \\le x_1, x_2 \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+x_1%2C+x_2+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
what will be the behavior of the sequence defined by the recursive
relationship:

![x\_{n+1}=x_n\\sqrt{1-x\_{n-1}^2}+x\_{n-1}\\sqrt{1-x_n^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Dx_n%5Csqrt%7B1-x_%7Bn-1%7D%5E2%7D%2Bx_%7Bn-1%7D%5Csqrt%7B1-x_n%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

*Answer:* It will converge to a cycle of length 3, where ![x_n,
x\_{n+1},
x\_{n+2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%2C+x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%2C+x_%7Bn%2B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the sines of the 3 angles of a right or an acute triangle.
Further, let
![M](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the well-known Mātrā-meru sequence: **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…**,
then:

![x_n=\\sin\\left(M\[n\]\\arcsin\\left(x_1\\right)+M\[n+1\]
\\arcsin\\left(x_2\\right)
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28M%5Bn%5D%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_1%5Cright%29%2BM%5Bn%2B1%5D+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_2%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);  
![x\_{n+1}=\\sin\\left(M\[n+1\]\\arcsin\\left(x_1\\right)+M\[n+2\]
\\arcsin\\left(x_2\\right)
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28M%5Bn%2B1%5D%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_1%5Cright%29%2BM%5Bn%2B2%5D+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_2%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);  
![x\_{n+2}=\\sin\\left(\\pi-M\[n+2\]\\arcsin\\left(x_1\\right)+M\[n+3\]
\\arcsin\\left(x_2\\right)
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B2%7D%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cpi-M%5Bn%2B2%5D%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_1%5Cright%29%2BM%5Bn%2B3%5D+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_2%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Where ![M\[n+1\]\\arcsin\\left(x_1\\right)+M\[n+2\]
\\arcsin\\left(x_2\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Bn%2B1%5D%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_1%5Cright%29%2BM%5Bn%2B2%5D+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28x_2%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the largest such angle that is ![\\le
\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This can be easily proved thus:

1\) Since ![0 \\le x_1, x_2 \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+x_1%2C+x_2+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we can write ![x_1=\\sin(A),
x_2=\\sin(B)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Csin%28A%29%2C+x_2%3D%5Csin%28B%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

2\) Thus, given the recursive relationship the next term becomes,  
![x_3=\\sin(A)\\cos(B)+\\sin(B)\\cos(A)=\\sin(A+B)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_3%3D%5Csin%28A%29%5Ccos%28B%29%2B%5Csin%28B%29%5Ccos%28A%29%3D%5Csin%28A%2BB%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

3\) Continuing this way, we can write,  
![x_4=\\sin(A+2B); \\; x_5=\\sin(2A+3B); \\; x_6=
\\sin(3A+5B)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_4%3D%5Csin%28A%2B2B%29%3B+%5C%3B+x_5%3D%5Csin%282A%2B3B%29%3B+%5C%3B+x_6%3D+%5Csin%283A%2B5B%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

We notice the multiplicands of ![A,
B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C+B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are the successive terms of the Mātrā-meru sequence. Thus,
![x_n=\\sin\\left(M\[k\]A+M\[k+1\] B
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28M%5Bk%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B1%5D+B+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

4\) This will continue till
![M\[k\]A+M\[k+1\]B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Bk%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B1%5DB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
comes closest to
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then the next term ![M\[k+1\]A+M\[k+2\]B \\ge
\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Bk%2B1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B2%5DB+%5Cge+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
But due the symmetry of the sine function,

![\\sin(M\[k+1\]A+M\[k+2\]B)=\\sin(\\pi-M\[k+1\]A+M\[k+2\]B)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28M%5Bk%2B1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B2%5DB%29%3D%5Csin%28%5Cpi-M%5Bk%2B1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B2%5DB%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Since,
![M\[k+1\]A+M\[k+2\]B=M\[k-1\]A+M\[k\]B+M\[k\]A+M\[k+1\]B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Bk%2B1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B2%5DB%3DM%5Bk-1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%5DB%2BM%5Bk%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B1%5DB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

we get ![M\[k-1\]A+M\[k\]B+M\[k\]A+M\[k+1\]B+\\pi-M\[k+1\]A+M\[k+2\]B =
\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Bk-1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%5DB%2BM%5Bk%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B1%5DB%2B%5Cpi-M%5Bk%2B1%5DA%2BM%5Bk%2B2%5DB+%3D+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Thus, at this stage the three successive terms ![x_n, x\_{n+1},
x\_{n+2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%2C+x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%2C+x_%7Bn%2B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are sines of the 3 angles of an acute or right triangle and they will
settle into a cycle of those 3 values
![\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence, the above recursive relationship results in any pair of ![x_1,
x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converging to the 3 sines of an acute or right triangle. As a corollary
if you start with ![x_1,
x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are already sines of an acute or right triangle then you stay on
that triangle. Let us consider some special cases below (Figure 1).

![x_1=x_2=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3Dx_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the values are on an equilateral triangle and the iterates remain
fixed on that triangle (Figure 1, panel 1).

When ![x_1=\\tfrac{3}{4}; \\;
x_2=\\tfrac{4}{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%3B+%5C%3B+x_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B4%7D%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the values are on the 3-4-5 right triangle and the iterates remain
fixed on that triangle (Figure 1, panel 2).

When ![x_1=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}; \\;
x_2=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+x_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the values are on the half-square right triangle and the iterates
remain fixed on that triangle (Figure 1, panel 3).

When
![x_1=x_2=\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3Dx_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then they are not an acute or right triangle. However, within one
iteration the iterates converge to the sines of a right triangle, namely
the ![30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ \\;
\\triangle](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30%5E%5Ccirc-60%5E%5Ccirc-90%5E%5Ccirc+%5C%3B+%5Ctriangle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1, panel 4).

It is easy to see that if ![\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ge x_1=x_2 \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D+%5Cge+x_1%3Dx_2+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then they are on an isosceles triangle and remain on that. However, if
![\\arcsin(x_1)+\\arcsin(x_2) \<
\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x_1%29%2B%5Carcsin%28x_2%29+%3C+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then can we converge to an isosceles acute triangle? This happens in
special cases which can be determined by solving an equation. In order
to do so we shall take ![x_2=x; \\; x_1=k-x; \\; k\<
\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_2%3Dx%3B+%5C%3B+x_1%3Dk-x%3B+%5C%3B+k%3C+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the above proof the successive angles corresponding to the iterates
of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are:

![\\arcsin(k-x); \\; \\arcsin(x); \\arcsin(k-x) + \\arcsin(x); \\;
\\arcsin(k-x) + 2\\arcsin(x); \\; 2\\arcsin(k-x) + 3\\arcsin(x); \\;
3\\arcsin(k-x) +
5\\arcsin(x)...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28k-x%29%3B+%5C%3B+%5Carcsin%28x%29%3B+%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+%5Carcsin%28x%29%3B+%5C%3B+%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+2%5Carcsin%28x%29%3B+%5C%3B+2%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+3%5Carcsin%28x%29%3B+%5C%3B+3%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+5%5Carcsin%28x%29...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we have to look for real solutions of the equations such as:

![\\arcsin(k-x)=\\pi -
(\\arcsin(k-x)+\\arcsin(x))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28k-x%29%3D%5Cpi+-+%28%5Carcsin%28k-x%29%2B%5Carcsin%28x%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![\\arcsin(x) = \\pi -(\\arcsin(k-x) +
\\arcsin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x%29+%3D+%5Cpi+-%28%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+%5Carcsin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![\\arcsin(x) = \\pi -(\\arcsin(k-x) + 2\\arcsin(x))
...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x%29+%3D+%5Cpi+-%28%5Carcsin%28k-x%29+%2B+2%5Carcsin%28x%29%29+...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Let consider the example of ![k=
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
with either of the first two equations we get degenerate triangles (e.g.
![x_1=0, x_2=1,
x_3=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D0%2C+x_2%3D1%2C+x_3%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
However, if we instead take ![x_1=\\tfrac{1}{m},
x_2=\\tfrac{m-1}{m}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bm%7D%2C+x_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bm-1%7D%7Bm%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for some large
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get near-isosceles triangles (Figure 1, panel 5).

The one equation with a real solution for
![k=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which gives a unique isosceles triangle, is seen when:

![\\arcsin(1-x) +3 \\arcsin(x) = \\pi, \\; x \\approx
0.83756543528332](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%281-x%29+%2B3+%5Carcsin%28x%29+%3D+%5Cpi%2C+%5C%3B+x+%5Capprox+0.83756543528332&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the greatest root
![(r_1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r_1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the cubic equation
![4x^3-4x+1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4x%5E3-4x%2B1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![x_1=1-r_1, x_2=
r_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D1-r_1%2C+x_2%3D+r_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yields an isosceles triangle with its equal angles ![\\arcsin(r_1)
\\approx
56.88^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28r_1%29+%5Capprox+56.88%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1, panel 6).

Next we shall consider the evolution of certain special sequences of
triangles. The first is where ![x_1,
x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are constituted by successive terms of the Mātrā-meru sequence (Figure
2).

[![Contri_Fig2_meru](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/contri_fig2_meru.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/contri_fig2_meru.png)Figure

Here, the triangles start with the ![30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ \\;
\\triangle](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30%5E%5Ccirc-60%5E%5Ccirc-90%5E%5Ccirc+%5C%3B+%5Ctriangle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and converge to a unique scalene triangle with angles
![\\arcsin\\left(\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}\\right) -
\\arcsin\\left(\\tfrac{3\\phi-1}{2\\phi+1}\\right) -
\\arcsin\\left(\\tfrac{2\\sqrt{\\phi}}{\\phi+1}\\right) \\approx
38.17^\\circ - 65.48^\\circ -
76.35^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D%5Cright%29+-+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B3%5Cphi-1%7D%7B2%5Cphi%2B1%7D%5Cright%29+-+%5Carcsin%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D%7D%7B%5Cphi%2B1%7D%5Cright%29+%5Capprox+38.17%5E%5Ccirc+-+65.48%5E%5Ccirc+-+76.35%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![\\phi=
\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden ratio.

The last panel here shows an interesting numeric coincidence. If you
start with ![x_1=r_1,
x_2=1-r_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3Dr_1%2C+x_2%3D1-r_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(see above for
![r_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
you converge to a triangle close to that emerging from the Mātrā-meru
sequence. Is there more to this than the coincidence of values?

Finally, let us consider 2 other special triangles that emerge as
convergents for 2 related types of operations based on the Mātrā-meru
sequence (Figure 3).

The first 2 rows (in light green) show triangles emerging from
![x_1=\\tfrac{1}{M\[k\]},
x_2=\\tfrac{1}{M\[k+1\]}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%5Bk%5D%7D%2C+x_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%5Bk%2B1%5D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![k=2, 3,

Here again, we start with a ![30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ \\;
\\triangle](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30%5E%5Ccirc-60%5E%5Ccirc-90%5E%5Ccirc+%5C%3B+%5Ctriangle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and converge to a triangle of the form ![\\approx 70.82^\\circ -

43.77^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+70.82%5E%5Ccirc+-+65.41%5E%5Ccirc+-+43.77%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The second 2 rows (in yellow) show triangles emerging from
![x_1=\\tfrac{1}{M\[k\]},
x_2=\\tfrac{1}{M\[k\]}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%5Bk%5D%7D%2C+x_2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%5Bk%5D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![k=3, 4,
5...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D3%2C+4%2C+5...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These converge to a triangle of the form ![\\approx 87.29^\\circ -
57.30^\\circ -
35.41^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+87.29%5E%5Ccirc+-+57.30%5E%5Ccirc+-+35.41%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The twin Aśvin-s and Rudra are both Indo-Aryan reflexes of two
deity-classes which can be reconstructed as likely being present in the
Proto-Indo-European religion. Both are likely to have even deeper roots
going back to even earlier religious traditions across a wide swath of
humanity. Indeed, the divine twins feature even outside the IE
religions. At the face of it it is not obvious if these two deity
classes show any special links. For example, with Rudra as a focus we
can use the Ṛgveda to sample his association with other deities. One
proxy for association can be how often Rudra is mentioned with another
deity in the same pāda or hemistich of a ṛk. Below is a table showing
his co-occurrences by this metric.

***Table 1. The association of various Devatā-s with Rudra in the RV***

| **Devatā** | **#** |
|:-----------|------:|
| Marut-s    |    21 |
| Vasu-s     |    18 |
| Āditya-s   |    13 |
| Agni       |    10 |
| Ṛbhu-s     |     7 |
| Indra      |     6 |
| Aśvin-s    |     6 |
| Soma       |     6 |
| Varuṇa     |     5 |
| Mitra      |     5 |
| Bhaga      |     5 |
| Puṣaṇ      |     4 |
| Viṣṇu      |     3 |
| Bṛhaspati  |     2 |
| Sarasvatī  |     2 |
| Tvaṣṭṛ     |     2 |
| Aryaman    |     1 |
| Savitṛ     |     1 |
| Aditi      |     1 |
| Vāyu       |     1 |

Not surprisingly, he is most closely associated with his sons the
Marut-s who are often referred to as the plurality of Rudra-s. The other
close associations come from the fact that the Rudra-s are mentioned as
a group of gods along side to two other big groups of gods: the Vasu-s
and the Āditya-s. He further shows notable associations with one of the
archetypal deities of the Vasu-group, Agni with who he shares a duality.
Beyond that his mentions along with the Aśvin-s is no more frequent than
with Soma, Indra or the Ṛbhu-s (the divine craftsmen whose masters are
said to be the Rudra-s: RV 8.7.12). That said a closer look reveals a
deeper link between Rudra and the Aśvin-s.

uta tyā me raudrāv arcimantā  
nāsatyāv indra gūrtaye yajadhyai \|  
manuṣvad vṛktabarhiṣe rarāṇā  
mandū hitaprayasā vikṣu yajyū \|\| RV 10.61.15

Also these two sons of Rudra, the Nāsatya-s \[worshiped\] with ṛk-s, are
to be welcomed and made offerings by me, O Indra. The two who are
liberal to him, who as Manu \[had done, invites them\] to the woven
grass (the twisted barhiṣ in the vedi), the delightful \[twins\] for
whom pleasing offerings are made, the twins who seek the ritual among
the people.

Here the ṛṣi Kakṣīvān calls the Aśvin-s the sons of Rudra in a manner
similar to the Marut-s. Further, this sūkta mentions our ancient
ancestor Cyavāna as the one who had measured out the vedi for the for
the Aśvin-s. Cyavāna is mentioned in tradition as the one who instituted
the rite where soma is offered to the Aśvin-s. Indeed, in the above ṛk
it appears that Kakṣīvān seeks Indra permission for the same as there
are indications from later narratives that Indra was not entirely on
board with that. In any case, what is important for our current
discussion is the relatively unambiguous link of the Aśvin-s and Rudra
in this ṛk.

This is not the only instance the Aśvin-s are called Rudra-s or the
son-s or Rudra. Indeed, we encounter another such example elsewhere in
the RV:

tāv id doṣā tā uṣasi śubhas  
patī tā yāman rudravartanī \|  
mā no martāya ripave vājinī-  
vasū paro rudrāv ati khyatam \|\| RV 8.22.14

Just these two in the evening, these two auspicious lords at dawn, the
two who follow the tracks of Rudra in the course. Don’t look over and
beyond us to a roguish mortal, O Rudra-s with booty-bearing mares.

In this ṛk of Sobhari Kāṇva, they are not just called Rudra-s but also
specific described as Rudravartanī. This word is of considerable
interest in regard to this connection between these deities. It belongs
to class of compounds of the form “x+vartani” that are found throughout
the RV and used for different deities. The word vartani means wheel
(typically of the chariot) or track of the chariot wheel. Thus,
x+vartani compounds are usually interpreted as bahuvrīhi-s. Below we
list all the instances of such compounds in the RV along with the gods
they denote and the number of occurrences of each case:

-   **Rudravartani**
    -   Aśvin-s, 4
-   **Hiraṇyavartani**
    -   Aśvin-s, 6
    -   Sarasvatī, 1
    -   river goddess, 1
-   **Raghuvartani**
    -   Aśvin-s, 1
    -   Soma, 1
-   **Ghṛtavartani**
    -   Aśvin-s, 1
-   **Vṛjinvartani**
    -   Agni, 1
-   **Kṛṣṇavartani**
    -   Agni, 1
-   **Gāyatravartani**
    -   Indrāgnī, 1
-   **Dvivartani**
    -   Agni, 1

It is immediately apparent that this class of compounds are special
descriptors of the Aśvin-s for 12 of the 19 occurrences of them are used
for the Aśvin-s. This is likely a special allusion related to the
oft-mentioned speeding tricycle (tri-cakra) chariot of these gods.
However, it should be noted that such compounds, while most frequently
used for the Aśvin-s are not limited to them; e.g. Hiraṇya-vartani is
use for at least 2-3 distinct deities (river goddess Sindhu could be a
cryptic allusion to Sarasvatī). Some of the usages, such as
Hiraṇya-vartani or Raghu-vartani can be simply interpreted as the ones
with the golden wheels or one with swift wheels and appear to apply to
other deities than the Aśvin-s. Indeed, a related term “Hiraṇya-cakra”
is used for the actual Rudra-s, i.e. Marut-s (e.g. RV 1.88.5) or for
that matter Hiraṇya-ratha used for Indra (e.g. RV 1.30.16). Further,
some might be even typical of other deities: e.g. Kṛṣṇa-vartani (with
black tracks: alluding to the smoke) and Vṛjina-vartani (with curving
tracks, alluding to the flames) are apt for Agni for whom they are used.
The form dvi-vartana used Agni is simply indicative of two tracks left
behind by the two chariot wheels.

However, of all these Rudra-vartani is specifically used only for the
Aśvin-s on multiple occasions and by multiple composers. This suggests
that this term has a special connection with the Aśvin-s. Drawing the
cue from the more frequent Hiraṇya-vartani, also used for the Aśvin-s,
Rudra-vartani has been tradition interpreted as either Rudra= ruddy or
Rudra = fierce. Thus, the compound is understood as the Aśvin-s with
ruddy tracks, or those with fierce tracks — perhaps as an allusion to
their speeding chariot that is frequently seen in the RV, or as those
who go along terrifying paths. Entirely, independently of our
investigations, we learned that this line of reasoning was first
explored in detail by the great patriot Aurobindo Ghose. But the key is
the observation that this term is specific to the Aśvin-s. Rudra is not
used in the sense of “ruddy” elsewhere in the corpus. “Fierce or
terrible tracks” would have implied the form raudra-vartani, which we do
not ever encounter in this corpus. Further, ruddy horses or chariots are
described by terms like aruṇayugbhir aśvaiḥ (RV 6.65.2) and fierce
chariots by terms like tveṣa-ratha for the Marut-s (RV 5.61.13; also
perhaps a personal name of a Mitanni ruler among the Indo-Aryans of West
Asia). Indeed, the ferocity of the Marut-s’ chariots with ruddy horses
are alluded to elsewhere too (e.g. RV 1.88.2) but the term Rudravartani
is never applied to them even if it might be natural in this sense.

Thus, taken together with the instances where the Aśvin-s are called
Rudra-s or the sons of Rudra (see above and also below) we conclude that
Rudra-vartanī specifically indicates the association of the twins with
Rudra and means “the two who follow the track of Rudra”. After we
reached this conclusion, a search revealed that such a translation had
been independently conceived by the German indologist Hermann Oldenberg.
Notably, this link to Rudra is further strengthened by another instance
where they are called both Rudra-s and Hiraṇyavartanī:

ā no ratnāni bibhratāv  
aśvinā gacchataṃ yuvam \|  
rudrā hiraṇyavartanī  
juṣāṇā vājinīvasū  
mādhvī mama śrutaṃ havam \|\| RV 5.75.3  
Bearing treasures to us, Aśvins, come here, you two, O Rudra-s with
golden wheels, with booty-bearing mares, being pleased, the holders of
the honey-lore, hear my invocation.

We believe there are many dimensions to this connection:  
1) The ancient name of the Aśvin-s is Divo Napatā. The twin sons of
Dyaus. This is an equivalent of the name of their Greek cognates the
Dioskouroi (the national deities of the Spartans), meaning the youths of
Zeus (the cognate of Dyaus; Skt Divaḥ Kumārau) or their Lithuanian
cognates Dievo Suneliai (Sons of Dieva = Dyaus). Now Dyaus on occasion
is identified with Asura Rudra in the RV:

tvam agne rudro asuro maho divaḥ (RV 2.1.6)  
You, O Agni, are Rudra the Asura of heaven (Dyaus)

yathā rudrasya sūnavo divo  
vaśanty asurasya vedhasaḥ \| (RV 8.20.17)  
It shall be \[just\] as they wish, the sons of Rudra, the Asura of
heaven (Dyaus) are the wise ones.

And like in this case too:  
indrota tubhyaṃ tad dive tad rudrāya svayaśase \| (RV 1.129.3)  
Indra, this is for you and that heaven (Dyaus), for that self-glorious
Rudra.

The above indicate that there was an early Vedic tradition that
identified Rudra with Dyaus, in which sense he was also seen as the
father of world by the Bharadvāja-s (RV 6.49.10). This, together with
the appellation Divo Napātā for the Aśvin-s, hints a parallel Vedic
tradition which saw them as deities in the Rudra-class associated with
the leader of that class Rudra, the great Asura of Dyaus. Their “Raudra
nature” is clearly brought out in the ṛk RV 10.93.7: uta no rudrā cin
mṛḻatām aśvinā : Also, though being Rudra-s, may the Aśvin-s be
merciful. This plea for mercy to them is comparable to that typically
made to Rudra or the Marut-s. Consistent with this, they share their
medical prowess with Rudra (as physicians of the gods) and even more
tellingly also their knowledge of poisons with Rudra (RV 1.117.16: where
they either kill the brood of Viṣvāc with poison or destroy the poison
associated with the brood of Viṣvāc). Thus, across the RV, composers
from different clans occasionally saw the Aśvin-s as Rudra-s or Rudra’s
sons and allude to their Rudrian properties.

2\) One of the notable aspects differentiating the early Atharvaṇ
tradition from the RV tradition with regard to Rudra is the use of the
twin appellation Bhavā-Śarvā for the deity in the former. These names of
Rudra also persist in the ādhvaryava tradition preserved in the
Yajurveda-s but the twinning is less prominent relative the AV
tradition. Notably, in the celebrated Mṛgāreṣṭi ritual the AV tradition
features a sūkta to the twin Bhavā-Śarvā whereas in its place the KYV
tradition has ṛk-s to the Aśvin-s. Further, in the incantations for the
Śūlagava ox sacrifice laid out in the Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra (4.20.1-2),
Bhavā-Śarvā are called the sons of Mahādeva.

tasya te dhanur hṛdayam mana iṣavaś cakṣur visargas tam tvā tathā veda
namas te astu somas tvā avatu mā mā hiṃsīḥ \| yāv araṇye patayantau
vṛkau jambavantau iva \| mahādevasya putrābhyām bhava-śarvābhyām namaḥ
\|\|

The heart is your bow, the mind is your arrow, the eye is your shooting.
Thus we know you. Obeisance to you. May Soma protect him and may you
never ever harm me. The two who roam around in the forest like wolves
with jaws wide open; obeisance to the two sons of Mahādeva, Bhava and
Śarva.

This points to two parallel streams within the early Vedic tradition
which featured Rudra in singular form (apart from the plurality of the
Rudra-class) as seen in the RV or in twin form of Bhavā-Śarvā as seen in
the AV and the Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra (as the twin sons of Rudra). This
suggests that the Rudra-class had an ancient intrinsic twin nature
shared with the Aśvin-s which lingers in the Bhavā-Śarvā dyad. Notably,
even in Greek tradition the deity of the Rudra-class, Apollo is born
with twin (albeit female), Artemis. While the RV Aśvin-s are identical
twins in character, sometimes, in the IE world one sees some
differentiation of the the twins with one of them associated with
healing and animal-husbandry and the other with warfare. For example,
among the Yavana-s, one of the pair, Castor is a horse-trainer while the
other one Polydeuces is a boxer. A similar differentiation is perhaps
reflected in the twin Rudra-s, with the name Bhava indicating welfare
and health, and the and Śarva meaning and archer and indicating the
warrior nature of the second twin. Thus, it is likely that Bhava and
Śarva were part of the parallel Vedic tradition where they played the
role of the Aśvin-s as twin Rudra-s.

3\) A later reflex of this twinning in the Rudra-class appears to have
emerged via developments in the form of the Kaumāra tradition emerging
in the Indo-Iranian borderlands. There we see the dual form of the god
Kumāra as Skanda-Viśākha. This dyad is earliest attested in the
Atharvavedīya-Skanda-yāga from the AV-pariśiṣṭha-s and has a prolonged
presence in the Hindu tradition. We find an allusion to this in a simile
used in the Mahābhārata when Kṛṣṇa describes the twins, Nakula and
Sahadeva, to his brother Halāyudha:

yau tau kumārāv iva kārttikeyau  
dvāv aśvineyāv iti me pratarkaḥ \|  
muktā hi tasmāj jatuveśmadāhān  
mayā śrutāḥ pāṇḍusutāḥ pṛthā ca \|\| (Mbh “critical” 1.180.21)  
The two who are youths, like twin Kārttikeya-s,  
are the sons of the two Aśvin-s; so I infer.  
It has been heard by me that the sons of Pāṇḍu and Pṛthā  
have indeed escaped from the burning of the wax-house.

Here the sons of the Aśvin-s (their earthly manifestations) are
explicitly connected to the twin Kārttikeya-s — an allusion to the twin
deities, Skanda and Viśakha. The grammarian Patañjali mentions metal
images of Rudra along with the Skanda-Viśākha dyad in the Mauryan age
(\~322-185 BCE). The persistence of this tradition is illustrated by a
much later attestation of this dyad, evidently drawn from a now lost
early tradition, seen in the Kālikā-purāṇa with a predominantly East
Indian locus:

dahano ‘pi tathā kāle prāpte gaṅgodare svayam \|  
retaḥ saṅkrāmayāmāsa śāṃbhavaṃ svarṇa-sannibham \|\|  
Agni himself, in due course of time, transmitted the semen of Rudra,
which shone like gold, to the womb of Gaṅgā.

sā tena retasā devī sarva-lakṣaṇa-saṃyutaṃ \|  
pūrṇa-kāle ‘tha suṣuve putra-yugmaṃ manoharam \|\|  
Then by that semen the goddess, upon completion of pregnancy, gave birth
to charming twin sons endowed with all \[good\] features.

ekaḥ skando viśākhākhyo dvitīyaś cāru-rūpa-dhṛk \|  
śakti-dvaya-dharau dvau tau tejaḥ kānti-vivardhitau\|\| KP 46.82-84  
The first was Skanda and the second bearing a beautiful form was known
as Viśākha. The two held a spear each and two shone with their radiance.

Thus, we see Rudra siring the twin Kaumāra deities Skanda and Viśākha
who are described as bearing spears much like the depiction of the
spear-bearing Dioscuri in the yavana tradition. Interestingly, their
beauty is specifically described much like that of the Aśvin-s in Vedic
tradition. Further, the Kālikā-purāṇa recommends the worship of this
dual Kaumāra form for the ṣaṣṭhī night:

rātrau skanda-viśākhasya kṛtvā piṣṭa-putrikām \|  
pujayec chatrunāśāya durgāyāḥ prīyate tathā \|\| KP 60.50  
In the night having made images of Skanda and Viśākha from flour one
should worship them for the destruction of enemies and for pleasing
Durgā.

In archaeological terms we find depictions of the Skanda-Viśākha dyad on
Kuṣāṇa coins and also Kuṣāṇa age images from a lost Kaumāra shrine from
the holy city Mathura (now housed in the collections of the Mathura
museum). What is notable about their numismatic appearances is their
resemblance to the twin gods on Greek Dioscuri coins. Thus, like
Bhava-Śarva in a parallel Vedic tradition, Skanda-Viśākha are likely
developments of the ancient Raudra twins in a Para-Vedic tradition that
then entered the Indo-Aryan mainstream.

4\) Finally, it is plausible that the term Rudravartanī and the
association of the Aśvin-s with Rudra have an astronomical significance.
In the classic nakṣatra system that developed by the time of the AV and
the YV the Aśvin-s are associated with the constellation of Aśvayujau
which corresponds to part of Aries. However, the obvious constellation
that resembles the divine twins is Gemini, which was recognized as the
Dioscuri in the Greek tradition. While it was termed the constellation
of Aditi, the ārya-s too recognized the dual nature of the asterism
Punarvasu made up two stars Castor and Pollux — it is occasionally used
in dual like: punarvasū nakṣatram aditir devatā \|\|. Early on we see
the recognition of the twin nature in the statement that Aditi is
two-headed in the Yajurveda (Taittirīya Saṃhitā in 1.2.4; Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4.16). Ironically, Pāṇini reinforces the dual nature with
the sūtra: chandasi punarvasvor ekavacanam \|\| PAA 1.2.61. In the Veda
Punarvasu might be \[optionally take a\] singular declension. The
grammarians clarify that this is limited to the Veda while in common
speech it is always dual indicating its twin nature. The only direct
allusion to the asterism in RV (along with Revati) appears to be in RV
10.19.1 (by our ancestor Cyavāna), which associates it with Agni and
Soma in a cryptic hymn whose actual meaning has been hard to discern.
However, a potential connection is seen in RV 10.39.11 where the Aśvin-s
are called Rudravartanī and explicitly linked Aditi — pairing that is
otherwise rather unusual:

na taṃ rājānāv adite kutaś cana  
nāṃho aśnoti duritaṃ nakir bhayam \|  
yam aśvinā suhavā rudravartanī  
purorathaṃ kṛṇuthaḥ patnyā saha \|\| RV 10.39.11  
From nowhere troubles nor evil nor fear reach him, along with his wife,
for whom you two kings and Aditi prepare a chariot to be in the
forefront. O Aśvins, you who are easy to invoke, follow the track of
Rudra.

We take this to mean that the Aśvin-s here are associated with Aditi and
thereby the asterism of Punarvasu. Now, Punarvasu rises after the
constellation of Rudra, i.e. Ārdra (corresponding to Sirius and the
proximal bright stars of Canis Major). Thus, we can see the twins
literally following the track of Rudra in the sky.

While glorified with a 1000 names in the famous stotra of the early
Sātvata tradition of the Mahābharata, in the texts of an even earlier
period the god primarily went under that name Viṣṇu. Indeed, even the
litany of the 1000 names begins with viśvaṃ viśṇur vaśatkāraḥ signaling
the connection to that ancient layer of tradition, with viśvam i.e,
“everything” being an etymological elaboration of his name Viṣṇu, “the
all-pervader”. Further, vaṣaṭkāra indicates his link to the Vedic ritual
(the vaṣaṭ offering to Viṣṇu is already specifically mentioned twice in
the Ṛgveda) wherein we can trace the meteoric rise of this god as the
head-deity of one of the great sectarian streams of the āstika-s.

His later rise notwithstanding, it should be borne in mind that Viṣṇu is
a prominent deity of early Indo-European vintage. Mentioned 113 times in
Ṛgveda itself (Table 1), one can already sense his prominence in the
pantheon. His cognate in the Germanic world Víðarr provides evidence of
his importance in the early undivided IE days. In the Gylfaginning of
the Icelandic prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson, who still had links to the
old Germanic heathenism, described Víðarr thus:  
*“Víðarr is the name of the silent asa. He has a very thick shoe, and he
is the strongest next after Thor. From him the gods have much help in
all hard tasks.”*  
Here, his being “strongest next to Thor” is mirrored in the ārya
tradition where Viṣṇu is nearly equal/equal to his elder brother/friend
Indra. Víðarr “helped the gods in the hard tasks”, a specific feature
shared with Viṣṇu in the ārya tradition. Finally, his thick shoe is
related to the stride Víðarr takes in the final battle of the gods,
Ragnarok, where he tramples the nether jaw of the demonic Fenris-wolf
and opens its mouth wide apart to slay it. In the ārya tradition,
likewise Viṣṇu’s three demon-conquering wide strides are well-known and
this gives him his alternative name in the Veda, Urugāya, “the
wide-goer”. This is related to again related to the etymology of Víðarr
= “wider” and the very cognate of Víðarr, vitara, appears in the śruti
in the context of Viṣṇu: athābravīd vṛtram indro haniṣyan sakhe viṣṇo
vitaraṃ vi kramasva \|\| : Then Indra spoke as he prepared to slay
Vṛtra: “friend Viṣṇu stride widely.” The strides of Viṣṇu are also said
to make space by widening the universe for Indra to swing his vajra to
slay Vṛtra. This is parallel to Víðarr holding the jaws of the
Fenris-wolf wide apart.

Both Viṣṇu and Víðarr are mentioned as possessing a special world/realm.
In the case of Viṣṇu, who is called the “cowherd” or the
cattle-protector, it is wide pasture in a mountainous realm. Víðarr’s is
a case it is mentioned a thick with grass. Finally, we may note that
Víðarr is one of the deities to survive the Ragnarok and usher in the
new Germanic “satyayuga”. Among the ārya-s, as the “time-god”, he is
seen as again surviving the yuga-s in the later Viṣṇu-centric
traditions.

[![viShNu_taranis](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/vishnu_taranis.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/vishnu_taranis.png)*Figure
1. Viṣṇu (an image of seal impression of seal from Gandhāra;
Northwestern India showing a Hunnic or Iranic lord worshiping the god)
and Celtic Taranis (an ancient Gaulish bronze found in 1774 CE at Le
Chatelet, France)*

In the Celtic world, the chief Gaulish deity of the Indra-class,
Taranis, appears to have absorbed elements of his partner, the deity of
the Viṣṇu-class. We go somewhat out on a limb to suggest that the late
iconography of Taranis, before the end of the Gaulish religion, was
actually influenced by that of Viṣṇu carried either directly by Indian
or Indianized Iranic travelers to the West or from them via
intermediaries to the Gauls (Figure 1). Examples of this influence are
seen in the wheel-wielding images of Taranis and his depiction on the
famous Gundestrup cauldron. In the case of the latter, the Indian
influence is clinched by the elephants associated with the goddess
(probably Rhiannon) who is depicted similar to Lakṣmī the wife of Viṣṇu.
We postulate that this influence was because they could see obvious
parallels between their deities and the Indian counterparts, which in
turn was a consequence of Taranis absorbing elements of the original
Viṣṇu-class deity.

Closer to the Indo-Aryan realm, our Iranic cousins have deity called
Rashnu Razishta, the heavenly judge, who superficially plays a
Citragupta-like role. His name and sudden appearance without parallels
elsewhere in the IE world suggests that he is none other than a cognate
of the Indo-Aryan Viṣṇu. His name probably underwent a folk-linguistic
mutation from ‘vi’ to ‘ra’ for the Iranians probably (wrongly)
interpreted the ‘vi’ as a prefix with a negative connotation and
“corrected” it to ‘ra’ the proper one (A suggestion also made by
Puhvel/Dumezil though, in my opinion wrongly, opposed by some
Indo-Europeanists). His popular worship among the Iranians is hinted by
the occurrence of his name as part of personal names found in the
Persepolis Fortification Tablets from the time of the Achaemenid emperor
Darius-I: Rashnudāta and Rashnuka and the Parthian name Rashnumithra.
Rashnu’s link to Viṣṇu is indicated by his accompanying Mithra to his
right on his chariot when he rides forth for battle. In the Zoroastrian
strain of the Iranic religion, Mithra with his vazra has taken the place
of Indra and Rashnu retains the role of Viṣṇu now as Mithra’s assistant
instead (Note that even RV Viṣṇu is specifically linked to Mitra, e.g.
in RV 1.156.1 and RV 8.52.3). Notably, Yasht 12 to Rashnu (which has
been clearly redacted to interpolate Ahura Mazdā’s name for Rashnu in
the initial manthra-s) shows that he held an important role in the
ritual and he is described as tall, forceful deity praised in
superlative terms indicating the importance he once held in Iranian
realm:

rashnvô ashâum rashnvô razishta rashnvô spênishta rashnvô vaêdhishta
rashnvô vidhcôishta rashnvô parakavistema rashnvô dûraêdareshtema
rashnvô arethamat bairishta rashnvô tâyûm nijakhnishta…

O holy Rashnu! O most-true Rashnu! most-beneficent Rashnu! most-knowing
Rashnu! most- discerning Rashnu! most-fore-knowing Rashnu! most
far-seeing Rashnu! Rashnu, the best doer of justice! Rashnu, the best
smiter of thieves (tâyu = Skt stāyu)…

Keeping with his far-seeing nature, the yasht is unusual in describing
the Iranic karshvare-s (world regions) and heavenly constellations as
the regions seen by Rashnu as he flies along. This peculiar feature of
the yasht, seen with no other Iranic deity, points to two parallels with
Viṣṇu: (1) The listing of the realms is suggestive of Viṣṇu pervading
them or striding over them. (2) Among the places Rashnu is invoked there
are 3 stations mentioned in succession the quarters of the earth,
boundary of the earth and all over the earth. Apart from reminding one
of the three strides, it also reminds one of the ṛk where Viṣṇu is
described as fixing the boundary of the earth by the pegs at the
quarters (RV 7.100.3).

In conclusion, we see that the Viṣṇu-class of deities, despite their
spotty occurrence in what has come down to us of the IE traditions, can
be traced to a prominent proto-deity in the early IE religion. Here, by
early we mean at least the time when the western thrust of the IE people
from their Yamnaya homeland took place — the group from which the
Germanic, Celtic and Indo-Iranian branches ultimately derive. This
conclusion is of importance in understanding the rise of Viṣṇu in the
Indian tradition. We shall explore the early stages of that by looking
at the counts of the occurrence of the name Viṣṇu in several Vedic texts
(Table 1). These texts span the entire range of Vedic tradition from the
earliest RV to the Ṛgvidhāna which clings to the very edge of the late
Vedic literary activity. In between lie the Saṃhitā-s of the 3 other
Veda-s, the khila of the RV, the Brāhmaṇa-s, the Śrauta-sūtra-s and the
Gṛhya-sūtra-s. Across these texts the most common name of the deity
under consideration is Viṣṇu. He is known by other names like Urugāya,
Śipiviṣṭa and the epithet evaya in the core Vedic period. In the latest
Vedic texts we encounter the name Nārāyaṇa (e.g. Taittirīya-āraṇyaka),
which became prominent in the epic period. However, all these names are
generally rare making the count for Viṣṇu a good proxy for estimating
the extent of his mentions.

First, let us get some caveats regarding this table out of the way.
These texts are of very different sizes; thus, someone could claim that
the counts could simply reflect the size differences. Hence, one would
wish to normalize it by text size. But what unit do you use for
normalization? The word would be the ideal unit but it is difficult to
obtain for all these texts because of samasta-pada-s typical of Sanskrit
not being separated in each case. An alternative is the size of the file
in bits. However, this depends on the encoding/format used and we do not
have all the texts in a common encoding/format. Next, we have ascii or
utf-8/16 encoding files for many of them but not all. The rest were
counted using the html files on the TITUS system. We cannot be sure of
the completeness of all the texts in TITUS. This said, we can still use
the absolute counts reasonable well by comparing “apples with apples”.
The Saṃhitā-s may be approximately seen to be of the same order of
magnitude. The Brāhmaṇa can be again approximately compared, and the
equivalent classes of kalpa texts can be similarly compared.

With these caveats in place, one thing that stands out is the
extraordinary prominence of Viṣṇu in the Vedic tradition represented by
the Yajurveda. This is clearly in contrast with the other Vedic
tradition, namely that of the Samaveda. Tellingly, the one Samavedic
text that is enriched in Viṣṇu is the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, which is
primarily a collection of yajuṣ-es within the Samavedic tradition. This
short collection of yajuṣ-es has the same order of magnitude of mentions
of Viṣṇu as the SV Kauthuma-saṃhitā and Pañcaviṃśa-brāhmaṇa, both of
which are several times the size of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa.

The divisions in the Vedic tradition correspond to the roles of the
ritualists: the hautra tradition of the RV practitioners, the ādhvaryava
tradition of the YV practitioners and the chāndoga tradition of the SV
practitioners. The AV practitioners are associated with the role of the
Brahman but in reality have their own parallel śrauta tradition. We see
that in the ādhvaryava tradition the prominence of Viṣṇu is across the
three sections, i.e. the Saṃhitā, the Brāhmaṇa and Śrauta-sūtra-s that
roughly corresponding to temporal layers within the tradition. Further,
in the hautra tradition, the Śrauta-sūtra-s have more mentions of Viṣṇu
than their Brāhmaṇa-s, which are larger than the sūtra-s in size. Again,
notably, with one exception (we will come to that in the end) the
Gṛhya-sūtra-s have relatively low occurrences of Viṣṇu across the board
relative to the corresponding Śrauta-sūtra-s.

Now, in the śrauta practice the adhvaryu plays the most important role
in terms of the physical actions of the ritual (of course accompanied by
yajuṣ incantations). He also issues calls to the hotṛ and udgātṛ to play
their parts. The hotṛ in contrast primarily plays the role of reciting
the Sāmidhenī-s and the śastra-s and the like, while the udgātṛ’s main
role is the singing of the stotra-s during the Soma ritual. While the YV
and SV texts as we *have them today* clearly postdate and presuppose the
core RV, we know from the internal evidence of the RV that there were
already YV and SV practitioners alongside the composers of the RV. E.g.:
udgāteva śakune sāma gāyasi : You O bird sing a sāman like the udgātṛ.
tvam adhvaryur uta hotāsi pūrvyaḥ praśāstā potā januṣā purohitaḥ \| :
You (Agni) are the adhvaryu, the primal hotṛ, the praśastṛ (an assistant
of the hotṛ who is also known as the upavaktṛ or the maitrāvaruṇa who
plays a special role in recitations to those two gods), the potṛ (the
assistant of the Brahman who specializes in prāyaścitta-s) and from
birth the purohita. Further, the parallel in the Zoroastrian tradition
suggest that at least the hotṛ, the adhvaryu and some version of the
brahman go back to the proto-Indo-Iranian period.

While these ṛtvik-s function in unison in the śrauta rituals their
mantra collections and activities suggest that they originally
represented alternative ritual traditions within the early Indo-European
fold, which were brought together under a single framework by at least
the proto-Indo-Iranian period. While under a common framework they
clearly maintained their own parallel traditions, techniques of
composition and ritual principles. When we take this in to account,
along with the evidence for the presence of a prominent Viṣṇu-class
deity in the early Indo-European religion, we can account for the
development of Vaiṣṇava tendencies in the Veda: we posit that it was not
that Viṣṇu rose to prominence in the middle Vedic period (as opposed to
the early Vedic core RV with the Aindrāgna and old Āditya dominance)
from nothing but was always a special deity in the ādhvaryava tradition
of the Indo-Aryans. What happened was the rise to dominance of the
ādhvaryava tradition in the Indo-Aryan śrauta ritual. Conversely, it is
conceivable that on the Iranian side the hautraka tradition dominated,
at least in early Zoroastrianism where Zarathustra calls himself the
cognate zaotar.

These observations can be summed up by one statement in the ādhvaryava
tradition: yajño vai viṣṇuḥ \|: The ritual is verily Viṣṇu. Thus, by
identifying Viṣṇu with the ritual he is identified with the core
activities of the ādhvaryava tradition. Hence, this is consistent with
this frequent mention within this tradition. This proposal is further
strengthened by the two special devatā-dvandva-s that are common though
not unique to the YV tradition but not found in the RV Saṃhitā, which is
otherwise rich in devatā-dvandva-s. The main dvandva featuring Viṣṇu in
the RV is Indrāviṣṇū, where he is linked to his usual partner Indra. The
devatā-dvandva Agnāviṣṇū, found in the AV, RV-brāhmaṇa and frequently in
the YV tradition, marks the special position of Viṣṇu not only as the
last of the deities to receive the sacrifice but also tacitly or not so
tacitly indicates his supremacy by placing him at the end of the
pantheon (Aitaryeya-brāhmaṇa: agnir vai devānām avamo viṣṇuḥ paramas
tadantareṇa sarvā anyā devatā \| : Agni is the lowest of the gods, Viṣṇu
is the foremost, all the other deities lie in between. While primarily
positional it also hints the primacy of Viṣṇu). The second is the
dvandva Viṣṇū-varuṇā seen, for example, in the Taittirīya and the
Aitaryeya-brāhmaṇa traditions. This dvandva has a special role that is
typical of the ādhvaryava tradition, proper completion of yajña, the
invocation of Viṣṇu protects from the badly done yajña while the
invocation of Varuṇa protects the well-done one and between the two all
is taken care off viṣṇur vai yajṅasya duriṣṭam pāti varuṇaḥ sviṣṭaṃ \|
tayor ubhayor eva śāntyai \|\|).

Thus, the unusual situation of dvandva-s not found in the RV but shared
by the RV brāhmaṇa-s and YV tradition, and the prominence of Viṣṇu in
the “little YV” within the SV, i.e., the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, suggests that
these are late entrants into the SV and RV tradition from the YV
tradition. Indeed, the even greater prominence of Viṣṇu in the RV
Śrauta-sūtra-s as opposed to the Brāhmaṇa-s again indicates the
ādhvaryava dominance now entering the hautra territory. Thus, it
suggests that the rise of Viṣṇu was essential a feature of adhvaryava
dominance in the śrauta ritual. This in contrast to the protogonic
Prajāpati, who while emerging late from the para-Vedic periphery,
uniformly affected all the Vedic traditions. The Prājāpatya-s competed
with Viṣṇu for the two figures of the primordial turtle Kaśyapa and the
primordial boar Varāha. While the former was originally associated with
Indra (from the RV itself), the latter is hinted to be associated with
Viṣṇu in the early AV tradition recorded in the Paippalāda-saṃhitā.
However, the Prājāpatya-s laid a strong claim to both before Viṣṇu
eventually won and claimed both the figures as his avatāra-s in the
Post-Vedic period.

Finally, we saw that the Gṛhya-sūtra-s have a low frequency of mention
of Viṣṇu with the exception being that of the Taittirīya-affiliated
Vaikhānasa tradition. The Gṛhya-sūtra-s for most part generally record
an archaic core of household rites of passage quite different from the
śrauta rituals. Thus, the absence of a special role of Viṣṇu beyond
specific contexts like the fertility ritual for preparing the womb for
the embryo is not unexpected. Now, one of the two earliest sectarian
Vaiṣṇava traditions arose among the Vaikhānasa-s. Thus, what we are
seeing in the case of the Vaikhānasa-gṛhyasūtra is the emergence of this
tradition which went on to become a still extant system of the combined
iconic and fire worship of Viṣṇu. The second sectarian tradition
centered on Viṣṇu, the Pañcarātra, explicitly identifies itself with the
Śukla-yajurveda. Thus, we may say that rise of Vaiṣṇavam itself is an
internal development within the ādhvaryava tradition, with the two early
schools emerging from each of the main Yajurvedic divisions. Once these
had emerged they influenced the latest of the Vedic texts across the
traditions. We see this in the case of the Ṛgvidhāna, which, for a
relatively short text, has several mentions of Viṣṇu in the context of
what appears to be an early Pāñcarātrika section.

To conclude we may ask what about the Sātvata tradition that affiliates
itself to the Pāñcarātrika tradition? We have evidence that Viṣṇu’s
primary manifestation in that system the Vāsudeva along with the 3 other
vyūha deities and the goddess Ekānaṃśā probably have para-Vedic roots in
the Indo-Iranian borderlands. Likewise, with the watery Nārāyaṇa or his
humanized dyadic form of Nara-Nārāyaṇa. But these traditions always saw
itself as a part of Vaiṣṇava system. Hence, we posit that they are part
of greater “Vaiṣṇava” tradition of old IE provenance that in addition to
influencing the ādhvaryava tradition also had “lower” para-Vedic
registers such as these. Nevertheless, this tradition’s links to the old
Viṣṇu are hinted by certain specific features, for example: (1) The
Vāsudeva in his human manifestation (Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra) consorts with a
large number of women. Viṣṇu consorting with a bevy of goddesses is
already mentioned in RV 3.54.14. This also relates to his early
fertility role as the protector of the sperm of males. (2) Already in
the RV Viṣṇu is repeatedly mentioned as being the cowherd or the
cow-protector (RV 1.22.18; RV 3.55.10). Thus, this aspect of the
Devakīputra of the Sātvata religion are likely merely a humanization of
an old trait of the deity.

Lootika seeing Somakhya contemplating something remarked: “That great
clash of men is upon us, where, as the śruti says, our flag will be
mingled with that of the enemy in close combat.”  
Somakhya: “It’s almost as if your mind is reflecting mine!”  
Lootika: “Indeed, though born V1s our life is like that of V2s in a
sense like as this is the downward turn of the yuga-cakra. Hence, may
Vajrabāhu sink the dasyu to his left and bring light to the ārya on the
right.”  
Somakhya: “The founders of my clan or your Śaradvān clansman never shied
from yuddha. It is with that in mind O Gautamī we have to invoke the
fierce spells of our ancestors as enjoined by father Manu and as
Harihara and Bukka had done in the southern country before embarking on
the destruction of the makkha-rākṣasa-s. Before we make those oblations
we have protect and purify ourselves with the śāntyudaka as was done by
the young brahman Vicārin, the knower of the Atharvāṅgirasa-śruti.”

Early in the day Lootika placed the leaves of the secret plants known as
citi, tumburu, śigru, devadāru, pīlu, kapu, viparvā, rodākā, vṛkkavatī,
nāḍā and nirdahantī in the śāntyudaka pitcher. As she did so Somakhya
recited the following incantation of his ancient ancestors:

sahasva yātudhānān  
sahasva yātudhānyaḥ \|  
sahasva sarvā rakṣāṃsi  
sahamānāsy oṣadhe \|\|

Conquer the the yātudhāna-s, conquer the yātudhānī-s, conquer all the
rakṣa-s. You are conquering, O herb!

L: “O Ārya, tradition holds that a subset of these plants belong to the
Atharvan-s or the Bhṛgu-s and the other subset to the Āṅgirasa-s. How do
we place them in each of these categories.”  
S: “That is indeed so Varārohā. Those from citi to pīlu are those of my
ancestors while those from kapu to nirdahantī belong to yours. Such is
the lore passed down by the knowers of the Atharvaṇa-śruti.”

Then, as Lootika poured water from her kamaṇḍalu into the pitcher
Somakhya standing up held his palms in the añjalika-mudrā and recited
the following incantations of his ancient ancestors:

viśvād riprān muñcata sindhavo no  
yāny enāṃsi cakṛmā tanūbhiḥ \|  
indra-praśiṣṭā varuṇa prasūtā  
ā siṅcatāpo madhva ā samudre \|\|

O rivers, free us from all the impurity and from whatever sins we have
committed with our bodies. Directed by Indra, impelled by Varuṇa, O
waters pour honey into the sea.

yūyaṃ mitrasya varuṇasya yonir  
yūyaṃ somasya dhenavo madhiṣṭhāḥ \|  
yuṣmān devīr deva ā kṣiyantīndur  
yūyaṃ jinvata brahma-kṣatram āpaḥ \|\|

You are the seat of Mitra and Varuṇa, you are the sweetest cows of Soma.
In you, O goddesses, dwells the godly Moon. You, O waters, must impel
the the brahma and the kṣatra.

punānā āpo bahudhā sravanti  
imāṃś ca lokān pradiśaś ca sarvāḥ \|  
punantv asmān duritād avadyān  
muṅcantu mṛtyor nirṛter upasthāt \|\|

The waters, becoming pure, stream in many directions, throughout these
worlds and throughout all the quarters of space. Let them purify us from
evil, from disgrace; let them release us from death, from the lap of the
goddess Nirṛti.

Then he muttered the Sāvitrī and recited the Triṣaptīya hymn.

L: “Should the goddesses of the waters be correctly understood as
Apsaras-es with Urvaśī, Sahajanyā, Ghṛtācī and Menakā at their head?
Their being called upon to called upon to impel the brahma and the
kṣatra, who lead the society of the ārya-s, is similar to their being
invoked to protect the brahma-kṣatra in the Yajuṣ incantations known as
the Rāṣṭrabhṛt-s.”  
S: “One may understand it that way from the etymology of Apsaras-es,
which is a extension of the more basic form āpaḥ. Indeed, the
Rāṣṭrabhṛt-s further the equation with the Apsaras-es. It has also been
explicitly indicated by my ancient clansman Kavi, the son of Bhṛgu:

samudriyā apsaraso manīṣiṇam  
āsīnā antar abhi somam akṣaran \|

The marine Apsaras-es, sitting within, have streamed toward Soma of
inspired mantra-thought.

Here the word samudriyā indicates their belonging to the watery realm.
Further, the sense in which they are used in the ṛk of Kavi relates to
them being termed “somasya dhenavo madhiṣṭhāḥ” in the mantra-s we just
deployed. This identity of the Apsaras-es as the goddesses of the waters
is reinforced in the famous ritual of the apsaras-es and the gandharva
of the ocean, which we shall perform at a different time. There we shall
encounter another dangerous class of 80 Apsaras-es who are known as the
Uluṅgulukā-s, coming in groups of 31, 4, 10, 10, 25, associated with the
asura Uluṅgula. We shall see in a later rite how to ward off danger from
them by invoking Indra and obtain benefits instead.”

L: “Ah, I recall that while studying that rite I saw parallels between
the Atharvaṇic divisions of the Apsaras-es and the Greek division of the
water-nymphs into Naiads, Nereids, Oceanids and the like. This brings up
another point for discussion. The waters are described as streaming
through the worlds. The earthly realm is easily understood: the oceans
and rivers and the like. The atmospheric realm too is obvious. But what
about the heavenly realm? Even the moon is said to be contained in them.
This seems to be reiterated in the Taittirīya-śruti where waters are
described thus in the context of ‘watery’ nakṣatra of Pūrvāṣāḍhā:

yā divyā āpaḥ payasā saṃbabhūvuḥ \|  
yā antarikṣa uta pārthivīryāḥ \|

Here, the enumeration of the waters begins with the divine waters
followed by the more familiar ones. This suggests that our ancestors saw
the ‘waters’ not just in the earthly regions but extending even to the
heavenly realm. What might this mean?”

S: “That used seem puzzling to me too. But the clue comes from that very
ṛk regarding Pūrvāṣāḍhā that you cited. I slips out of my mouth
involuntarily whenever I see the said constellation on a clear night
with Milky Way. It is telling that its states: ‘yā divyā āpaḥ payasā
saṃbabhūvuḥ \|‘ Which heavenly waters had their being by milk. We hold
that the milk mentioned here is none other than the Milky Way — an
analogy which is rather clear to anyone who has beheld the core of our
galaxy on a good night. Hence, it is possible that the heavenly waters
were an allusion to the Milky Way. This might also apply to the term
divyaṃ nabhas to which we offer the barhiṣ at the end of the ritual.”

L: “The idea of divyā āpaḥ is also philosophically satisfying in a
current sense. After all where did water on the earth come from? Most
likely from the asteroids, the comets, and the objects of the dwarf
planet belt. Thus, we may say all the earthly waters are indeed from the
divyā āpaḥ.”

Later that evening knotting the yoktra girdle around Lootika’s waist
Somakhya indicated to her to cover the mouth of the pitcher with her
palms. Then he uttered the incantations:

śaṃ no mitraḥ śaṃ varuṇaḥ  
śaṃ viṣṇuḥ śaṃ prajāpatiḥ \|  
śaṃ na indro bṛhaspatiḥ  
śaṃ no bhavatv aryamā \|\|

Weal to us Mitra, weal to us Varuṇa, weal to us Viṣṇu, weal to us
Prajāpati, weal to us Indra, weal to us Bṛhaspati. May Aryaman be
beneficent to us.

śaṃ no grahāś cāndramasāḥ  
śam ādityaś ca rāhuṇā \|  
śaṃ no mṛtyur dhūmaketuḥ  
śaṃ rudrās tigmatejasaḥ \|\|

Weal to us the planets and the Moon, weal to us the Sun and the
eclipses, weal to us death and the comets, weal the Rudra-s of sharp
luster.

śaṃ rudrāḥ śaṃ vasavaḥ  
śam ādityāḥ śam agnayaḥ \|  
śaṃ no maharṣayo devāḥ  
śaṃ devyāḥ śaṃ bṛhaspatiḥ \|\|

Weal the Rudra-s, weal the Vasu-s, weal the Āditya-s, weal the Agni-s,
weal to us the great seers and gods, weal to us the goddesses and
Bṛhaspati.

Then Somakhya steeped a fistful of darbha in the water and uttered the
following incantation:

pṛthivī śāntir antarikṣaṃ śāntir dyauḥ śāntir  
āpaḥ śāntir oṣadhayaḥ śāntir vanaspatayaḥ śāntir  
viśve me devāḥ śāntiḥ sarve me devāḥ śāntiḥ  
śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntibhiḥ \|  
yad iha ghoraṃ yad iha krūraṃ  
yad iha pāpaṃ tac chāntaṃ  
tac chivaṃ sarvam eva śam astu naḥ \|\|

The Earth peaceful, the atmosphere peaceful, the heaven peaceful, the
waters peaceful, the plants peaceful, the trees peaceful, all gods my
peace, the collection of gods my peace, peace be peaceful. By peace, I
render all that is terrible here, all that is cruel here, all that is
sinful here, peaceful and auspicious. Let all this be weal to us.

Then he sprinkled the water on himself, her and around the vedi with the
below incantations:

agnir āyuṣmān sa vanaspatibhir āyuṣmān \|  
sa māyuṣmān āyusmantaṃ kṛṇotu \|\|

Agni is full of life: with the trees he is full of life. Full of life
let him make me full of life.

vāyur ayuṣmān so ‘ntarikṣeṇāyuṣmān \|  
sa māyuṣmān āyusmantaṃ kṛṇotu \|\|

Vāyu is full of life: with the atmosphere he is full of life. Full of
life let him make me full of life.

indra āyuṣmān sa viryeṇāyuṣmān \|  
sa māyuṣmān āyuṣmantaṃ kṛṇotu \|\|

Indra is full of life: with manliness he is full of life. Full of life
let him make me full of life.

devā āyuṣmantas te ‘mṛtenāyuṣmantaḥ \|  
te māyuṣmanta āyuṣmantaṃ kṛṇvantu \|\|

The gods are full of life: with ambrosia they are full of life. Full of
life let them make me full of life.

They seated themselves on the reddish brown bull skin to commence the
ritual. Somakhya then placed a fire-stick of the vikaṅkata plum in the
vedī dipped in ghee: “Gautamī, it has been stated in the śruti: vajro
vai vikaṅkataḥ ।; hence, for such a ritual we use this samidh. It is an
ancient medicinal plant, perhaps used an Indian substitute for the
willow.” He then muttered the vāravantīya incantation to the god Agni of
his ancient clansman who had transferred to the clan of the
Vaiśvāmitra-s:

aśvaṃ na tvā vāravantaṃ  
vandadhyā agniṃ namobhiḥ \|  
samrājantam adhvarāṇām \|\|

This is to praise you, Agni, with salutations, the one like tail of the
horse \| the one of excellent things, presiding like the emperor over
the ritual.

The great god Vaiśvānara, who takes the oblations to the deva-s, blazed
forth illuminating their fire-room with a purple hue in the dim twilight
even as the last rays of the sun withdrew from the sky. Lootika looking
at the ever-moving flames was deeply moved by this thought: It is indeed
for this reason our ancient ārya ancestors called him vāravant — his
sinuous movements are verily like the prancing tail of a horse dashing
across the grassy steppe. His changing from form to form, like the
vibhakti-s of the substantives, he truly embodies the ever-moving aspect
of the ṛta. Hence, my ancestor Nodhas had stated thus when he performed
a sacrifice for the king Śātavaneya:

mūrdhā divo nābhir agniḥ pṛthivyā  
athābhavad aratī rodasyoḥ \|  
taṃ tvā devāso ‘janayanta devaṃ  
vaiśvānara jyotir id āryāya \|\|

The head of heaven and the navel of the earth is Agni. Then he became
the spoked wheel of the world-hemispheres. The gods generated you, that
god Vaiśvānara, verily as light for the Ārya-s.

Indeed, that wheel in the midst of the world-hemispheres indicates his
ever-moving moving form as the celestial cycles. She snapped out her
reveries as she had to fill the sruk and hand it over to Somakhya to
pour out the great attacking oblations.

yo no dipsād adipsato  
dipsato yaś ca dipsati \|  
vaiśvānarasya daṃṣṭrayor  
agner api dadhāmi tam \|\| + vau3ṣaṭ

Him who, though unharmed, would harm us, and him who, harmed, would harm
us,  
I verily place between the two fangs of Agni Vaiśvānara.

Then Somakhya made the sruva offering to the foe-killing Vāyu:

sagarāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \| śarṇilāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \| samudrāya
śatruhaṇe svāhā \|  
sāndhasāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \| iṣirāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \| avasyave
śatruhaṇe svāhā \|  
vāyave śatruhaṇe svāhā \| vātāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \| mātariśvane
śatruhaṇe svāhā \| pavamānāya śatruhaṇe svāhā \|\|

L: “These 10, sometimes obscure, names of Vāyu bring to mind some yajuṣ
oblations that I have heard my father making from the
Taittirīya-śruti.”  
S: “There are two sets of such oblations among the Taittirīyaka-s. The
first of those are related to the ‘offering of the seven winds’ or the
Vāta-nāmāni:

samudrāya tvā vātāya svāhā \| salilāya tvā vātāya svāhā \| anādhṛṣyāya
tvā vātāya svāhā \| apratidhṛṣyāya tvā vātāya svāhā \| avasyave tvā
vātāya svāhā \| duvasvate tvā vātāya svāhā \| śimidvate tvā vātāya svāhā
\|\|

The second of those are rather remarkable in associating Vāyu with the
the Marut-s, a development which completely enveloped the latter in the
epic period, as in the Rāmāyaṇa:

samudro ‘si nabhasvān ārdradānuḥ śambhūr mayobhūr abhi mā vāhi svāhā
\|  
māruto ‘si marutāṃ ganaḥ śambhūr mayobhūr abhi mā vāhi svāhā \|  
avasyur asi duvasvāñ śambhūr mayobhūr abhi mā vāhi svāhā \|\|”

L: “It is notable that while these are pauṣṭika, our AV prayoga is
abhicārika. This is rather reminiscent of the Iranian tradition where a
long series of Vātanāmāni are prescribed to be deployed in the sacrifice
to be performed when an Iranian is under attack or during war. However,
what is consistent across such Vāyu invocations in our vaidika
traditions is the association of Vāyu with moisture and the waters:
salila, sagara, samudra, śarṇila and ārdra-dānuḥ(!).”  
S: “In fact that watery connection is seen in the very same Iranian
collection of incantations you alluded to, suggesting that this is an
ancient feature from the Indo-Iranian period referring to Vāyu as the
bearer of moisture and the stirrer of water-bodies. The Avestan
incantations states:

ýazâi apem ca bakhem ca  
ýazâi âxshtîm hãm-vaiñtîm ca  
suyãm ca kataremcit  
tem vayêmcit ýazamaide  
tem vayêmcit zbayamahi

I will sacrifice to the waters and to him who divides them. I will
sacrifice to the peaceful one, whose breath is beneficent, and to weal,
both of them. To this Vayu do we sacrifice, this Vayu do we invoke.”

Next they prepared the sruk for offering to Indra:

indrasya bāhū sthavirau vṛṣāṇau  
citrā imā vṛṣabhau pārayiṣṇū \|  
tau yokṣe prathamo yoga āgate  
yābhyāṃ jitam asurāṇāṃ svar yat \|\|+ vau3ṣaṭ

Indra’s two arms, firm and manly, these two are wondrous as stud bulls.
The \[time of\] yoking has arrived, I first yoke these two, by which the
heaven of the Asura-s was conquered.

S: “This is the famous Atharvanic apratiratha-ṛk. The arms of Indra are
compared to fierce bulls, something our ancestors would seen in a rather
unadulterated form on the steppes from even before the age of the śruti.
But do you suspect a wordplay here?”  
L: “Seems so. While the reference is to the two bulls, the time of
yoking I believe actually refers to horses being yoked to the ratha,
that key war-conveyance of the ārya-s. The time of yoking is verily that
of the warrior yoking the horses for war. But what the mantra conveys is
that even before the horses we first yoke the Vajra- and the
arrow-bearing arms of Maghavan that bring victory.”  
S: “Good.”

They prepared the sruk for the next oblation with the below
incantation:  
atisṛtyātisarā  
indrasyaujasā hata \|  
aviṃ vṛka iva mathnīta  
tato vo jīvan mā moci  
prāṇam asyāpi nahyata \|\| + vau3ṣaṭ

Having overtaken him the spells slay \[him\] with the might of Indra,
snatch him like a wolf a sheep. Then let him not get away from you
alive, indeed block his breath.

L: “The atisara which is dispatched reminds one of the missile
dispatched in the hair-raising combat between Arjuna and Karṇa in the
national epic, which was much like that of Śatamanyu and Vṛtra. There
when Karṇa deployed the missile of Rāma Bhārgava it is said to be of
Atharvaṇic nature:

rāmād upāttena mahāmahimnā  
ātharvaṇena+arivināśanena \|  
tad arjunāstraṃ vyadhamad dahantaṃ  
pārthaṃ ca bāṇair niśitair nijaghne \|\|

With the \[missile\] of great might obtained from Rāma, the Atharvaṇic
foe-destroyer, \[Karṇa\] smashed that fiery weapon of Arjuna and he
pierced Pārtha with sharp arrows.

Then again when finally Arjuna killed Karṇa with a gigantic missile it
is said:

kṛtyām atharvāṅgirasīm ivogrāṃ  
dīptām asahyāṃ yudhi mṛtyunāpi \|  
bruvan kirīṭī tam atiprahṛṣṭo  
ayaṃ śaro me vijayāvaho ‘stu \|\|

Having fired the blazing weapon fierce as an Atharvāṅgirasa Kṛtyā
incapable of being endured by Death herself in battle, the crowned one
(Arjuna) said with great joy: “Let this arrow be victory-bearing to me.”

S: “For a V2 in battle the atisara might indeed be his actual weapon,
while a V1 performing such a prayoga might visualize it as striking his
foe like a wolf seizing a sheep. In the national epic there is another
such account of the deployment of a śakti made by Tvaṣṭṛ for Rudra by
Yudhiṣṭhira which was be worshiped with such mantra-s. Let us read it
out in full for it is most inspiring:

tatas tu śaktiṃ rucirogra-daṇḍāṃ  
maṇi-pravālojjvalitāṃ pradīptām \|  
cikṣepa vegāt subhṛśaṃ mahātmā  
madrādhipāya pravaraḥ kurūṇām \|\|

The great soul, the foremost of the Kuru-s \[Yudhiṣṭhira\] then hurled
with great force at the king of the Madra-s that blazing śakti with a
well-made and fierce handle blazing \[like\] with the shine of gems and
corals.

dīptām athaināṃ mahatā balena  
savisphuliṅgāṃ sahasā patantīm \|  
praikṣanta sarve kuravaḥ sametā  
yathā yugānte mahatīm ivolkām \|\|

All the Kuru-s together saw that blazing dart emitting sparks as it
powerfully flew hurled with great might like a meteorite \[falling\] at
the end of the yuga.

tāṃ kālarātrīm iva pāśa-hastāṃ  
yamasya dhātrīm iva cograrūpām \|  
sabrahma-daṇḍa-pratimām amoghāṃ  
sasarja yatto yudhi dharmarājaḥ \|\|

Guiding it, the Dharmarāja hurled that \[missile\], which was of
dreadful form like the goddess of the night of dissolution holding a
noose, the midwife who birthed Yama, and infallible as the rod of
Brahman.

gandha-srag argyāsana-pānabhojanair  
abhyarcitāṃ pāṇḍusutaiḥ prayatnāt \|  
saṃvartakāgni-pratimāṃ jvalantīṃ  
kṛtyām atharvāṅgirasīm ivogrām \|\|

With much effort the sons of Pandu had worshiped \[that missile\] with
perfumes and garlands, water pourings, a seat, drinks and food. It
blazed like the fire of destruction and was fierce as an Atharvāṅgirasa
Kṛtyā.

īśāna-hetoḥ pratinirmitāṃ tāṃ  
tvaṣṭrā ripūṇām asu-deha-bhakṣām \|  
bhūmy-antarikṣādi-jalāśayāni  
prasahya bhūtāni nihantum īśām \|\|

For the sake of Īśāna this missile was engineered by Tvaṣṭṛ; it consumes
the breath and bodies of foes. By its force it can violently destroy the
Earth, the atmosphere, water-bodies and living beings.

bala-prayatnād adhirūḍha-vegāṃ  
mantraiś ca ghorair abhimantrayitvā \|  
sasarja mārgeṇa ca tāṃ pareṇa  
vadhāya madrādhipates tadānīm \|\|

Thus, with a forceful effort, having inspired it with fierce mantra-s,
\[Yudhiṣṭhira\] released it with utmost momentum along the best
trajectory for the destruction of the lord of the Madra-s.

hato ‘sy asāv ity abhigarjamāno  
rudro ‘ndhakāyāntakaraṃ yatheṣum \|  
prasārya bāhuṃ sudṛḍhaṃ supāṇiṃ  
krodhena nṛtyann iva dharmarājaḥ \|\|

“There, you are killed”, roaring thus the Dharmarāja \[hurled the
missile\], having stretched his arm with a firm good hand, as if dancing
in wrath, even as Rudra had shot his arrow for bringing the end of
Andhaka.

As you would have noted, the weapon is said to be like the
Atharvāṅgirasa Kṛtyā and specifically it was inspired by mantra-s. Thus,
indeed a V2 might inspire his weapon as an atisara before its
deployment.”

L: “But what about the deployment of the Kṛtyā-prayoga related to the
famous sūkta starting with yāṃ kalpayanti…?”  
S: “That is used primarily in the deflecting mode. But this is primarily
in the attacking mode in the vaidika tradition.”

Then they continued with the next oblation:

Now here O fierce Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer, pierce him in his marman.
Trample him right here. O Śakra, I am your votary. We take hold of you,
O Indra. May we be in your favor.

L: “It is indeed clear from this mantra that the ārya chooses Indra,
whereas the śatru is anindra as has been clearly stated in the śruti.”  
S: “Next comes the oblation to delude the mind of the foe.”

yad veda rājā varuṇo

indro yad vṛtrahā veda

That which King Varuṇa knows, which the god Bṛhaspati knows, which Indra
the Vṛtra-slayer knows, is the truth which bewilders the mind \[of the
foe\].

By Śarva, but the blue-crested one, by Bhava, by the father of the
Marut-s, by the odd-eyed one and by the brown one the voice of he who
verbally \[attacks\] us is smitten.

śarva nīlaśikhaṇḍa  
vīra karmaṇi-karmaṇi \|  
imām asya prāśaṃ jahi  
yenedaṃ vibhajāmahe \|\| + vau3ṣaṭ

O Śarva, the blue-crested one, O hero, in every rite smite the food of
this one with whom we portion this out.

L: This triad strikes me as being one of the vaidika-prayoga-s
comparable to the tāntrika- prayoga-s like that of Bagalāmulkhī or
Varāhī. Bagalā is used identically for the vāca-stambhana-prakriyā while
the sow-headed Saṃketayoginī may be deployed for mohanam like the first
ṛk. The last mantra appears a little obscure to me.  
S: “One who is has ubhayavīrya in both the tāntrika and the vaidika
prayoga-s is truly an accomplished mantravādin, like that one from the
Kaliṅga country. Each path has its own rigor and strictures; hence, in
the least it is good to be educated in both. But for a V1 the priority
is the vaidika rite. As for the last mantra, I believe that it indicates
a bhrātṛvya with whom we are competing for space or glory.”

Finally, they made the mysterious oblation to Rudra and his son.

tvaṃ devānām asi rudra śreṣṭha  
tavas tavasām ugrabāho \|  
hṛṇīyasā manasā modamāna  
ā babhūvitha rudrasya sūno \|\| + vau3ṣaṭ

You are the chief of the gods O Rudra, the mightiest of the mighty, O
one of formidable arms. With fury, delighting in your mind, you had come
into being, O son of Rudra.

L: “That is quite remarkable! The son of Rudra clearly in singular here!
It seems to indicate the emergence of a proto-Skanda. In my readings I
have only encountered rudrasya sunuḥ in singular in that glorious sūkta
to the Marut-s of my ancestor Nodhas.”  
S: “That sūkta of Nodhas (RV 1.64) is truly an awe-inspiring one to the
Marut-s who are entirely spoken of in plural as is usual. But then as
you say we mysteriously get this singular occurrence of the singular
form in it (RV 1.64.12):

ghṛṣum pāvakaṃ vaninaṃ vicarṣaṇiṃ  
rudrasya sūnuṃ havasā gṛṇīmasi \|

The agile, pure, winning, all-seeing son of Rudra we extol with an
invocation.

Everywhere else in the RV the term is always in plural — rudrasya
sunavaḥ except for the rather notable similar singular usage by the
other Āṅgirasa clan, the Bharadvāja-s, in their parallel sūkta to the
Marut-s (RV 6. 66):

taṃ vṛdhantam mārutam bhrājad-ṛṣṭiṃ  
rudrasya sūnuṃ havasā vivāse \|

This growing Māruta, with a blazing spear, the son of Rudra I bring with
with an invocation.

Hence, it does seem that these rare singular usages for the Marut-s in
the śruti point to the latent tendency for consolidation of the Marut-s
into a single form. This process was indeed likely on the pathway to the
emergence of Skanda in the para-Vedic Indo-Iranian borderlands. I could
also point to a more circumstantial connection via the peculiar word
hṛṇīyasā in the AV mantra. Its root is of early Indo-European vintage
and can be related to the fury of the gods such as Rudra and Varuṇa.
Hence, it is notable that in the late Atharvaṇic tradition the hymns to
fury, the Manyu-sūkta-s are associated with a hapax ṛṣi named
Brahmāskanda, which is none other than the name of our patron deity.
Further, those Manyu hymns are used in the Skanda ritual of the late AV
tradition.”

One of the pleasures of an unstructured youth in the pre-computer era
was what we called calculator games. As our father took his prized
calculator with him to work we only got a little time with it in the
evenings. However, we got our break when a relative gifted us a Japanese
solar-powered calculator. The roots (pun intended) of this note lies in
the games that followed: One of those was determining the consequences
of simple functional iterations. We soon realized that these are
intimately related to some familiar and not so familiar sequences. Some
of them were mysterious and beyond our calculator efforts. We finally
cracked them and obtained a more formal understanding of the
convergences only when our mathematical knowledge improved and we were
in possession of a computer in the late phase of our youth. Consider
maps which are iterates of simple fractional functions of the form:

![x_0=0; \\; x_n=\\dfrac{1}{1+k
x\_{n-1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0%3B+%5C%3B+x_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Bk+x_%7Bn-1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If
![k=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![n \\to \\infty, \\; x_n \\to
\\dfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+x_n+%5Cto+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden Ratio

One can see that the iterates of this map are sequence of fractions: 0,
1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 13/21, 21/34. One notices that its terms
are derived from the famous mātrā-meru sequence.

If ![k=2, n \\to \\infty, \\; x_n \\to

This sequence of fractions can be derived from the famous Jacobsthal
sequence: ![2f\[n\]+(-1)^n; f\[1\]=
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2f%5Bn%5D%2B%28-1%29%5En%3B+f%5B1%5D%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
**1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171…**  
Like the mātrā-meru, the Jacobsthal sequence appears in numerous
seemingly unrelated places in mathematics.

These are related to the sequence ![f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n-3\];

Now, one can use the substitution
![x_n=y_n-\\tfrac{1}{k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3Dy_n-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to convert our map into an equivalent but alternative map:

![y\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{1}{k}\\left( 1+\\dfrac{1}{y_n}
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7By_n%7D+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By writing
![y_n=\\tfrac{w_n}{w\_{n-1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bw_n%7D%7Bw_%7Bn-1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the above map becomes a linear difference equation:

![w\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{1}{k}(w_n+w\_{n-1})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%28w_n%2Bw_%7Bn-1%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Such a linear difference equation defines the quadratic equation:
![y^2-\\tfrac{y}{k}-\\tfrac{1}{k}=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2-%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bk%7D-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with roots:

![y=\\dfrac{1\\pm
\\sqrt{4k+1}}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B4k%2B1%7D%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the map in the variable
![y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be attracted to the greater root ![\\tfrac{1+
\\sqrt{4k+1}}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%2B+%5Csqrt%7B4k%2B1%7D%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and repelled by the lesser root ![\\tfrac{1-
\\sqrt{4k+1}}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1-+%5Csqrt%7B4k%2B1%7D%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for any starting value of
![y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
except when ![y_0=\\tfrac{1-
\\sqrt{4k+1}}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_0%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1-+%5Csqrt%7B4k%2B1%7D%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
interesting aspects of the convergence of this type of map was discussed
[earlier](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/06/17/cobwebs-on-the-golden-hyperbola-and-parabola/).
Now, given that
![x_n=y_n-\\tfrac{1}{k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3Dy_n-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the attractor
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of our original maps in
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be:

![A=
\\dfrac{\\sqrt{4k+1}-1}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B4k%2B1%7D-1%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now if ![k \<
-\\tfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3C+-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be a complex number. Given that our original maps of the form
![x_n=\\tfrac{1}{1+k
x\_{n-1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Bk+x_%7Bn-1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are defined in real space
![\\mathbb{R}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
what will happen to the iterates in such a case? Consider an example of
![k=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x_0=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Here the map does not converge to a single attractor
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but cycles between 3 values: -1, 1/2, 2. Now, if we use a different
![x_0=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get 0, 1,
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the 3 values that the iterates cycle through depends on
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but the cycle length is always
![3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Consider another case where
![k=-\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x_0=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Here again the map does not converge to a single value but cycles
through 6 different values: 0, 1, 3/2, 2, 3,
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Again the cycle length is always 6 though the actual values change with
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This cycling in the above examples immediately suggests a connection
between the arithmetic operation of our map and trigonometry. This
connection becomes clear from the form
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
takes:

If ![k\<-\\dfrac{1}{4}, \\; A=
-\\dfrac{1}{2k}+i\\dfrac{\\sqrt{-4k-1}}{2k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3C-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%2C+%5C%3B+A%3D+-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2k%7D%2Bi%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B-4k-1%7D%7D%7B2k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If we have a complex number
![z=x+iy](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Dx%2Biy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then it defines an angle
![\\theta=\\textrm{Arg}(z)=\\arctan\\left(\\tfrac{y}{x}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%3D%5Ctextrm%7BArg%7D%28z%29%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7Bx%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the complex plane. Thus we get the angle corresponding to
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be:

![\\theta = \\textrm{Arg}(A)=
\\arctan\\left(-\\sqrt{-4k-1}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BArg%7D%28A%29%3D+%5Carctan%5Cleft%28-%5Csqrt%7B-4k-1%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Since for our purposes the sign of the angle does not matter we can work
with ![\\theta=
\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{-4k-1}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%3D+%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B-4k-1%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
As an aside, we can also express this angle as ![\\theta=
\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{-k}}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%3D+%5Carccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Csqrt%7B-k%7D%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Now when
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is real, ![\\theta =
\\textrm{Arg}(A)=\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BArg%7D%28A%29%3D%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{\\theta}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Ctheta%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and our map converges to a single value, i.e. it has cycle length 1.

Instead, when say ![k=-1, \\; \\theta=
\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{3}\\right)=\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-1%2C+%5C%3B+%5Ctheta%3D+%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{\\theta}=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Ctheta%7D%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and our map has cycle length 3. Similarly, when ![k=-\\tfrac{1}{3}, \\;
\\theta =
\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%2C+%5C%3B+%5Ctheta+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{\\theta}=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Ctheta%7D%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and our map has a cycle length 6.

What if
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
does not generate a
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is a rational sector of a circle? The simplest such example that
is easily apprehended is
![k=-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In such a case the map would never converge to single value or a cycle.
However, we observe remarkable behavior where it oscillates through
several overlapping cycles which are defined by “explosive'', much
greater than average values (Figure 1-4).

[![frac_iterate_01](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_01.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_01.png)

Figure 1 illustrates the cycle of length 13 (marked by red dots). One of
these starts at
![n=13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and decays in terms of absolute magnitude at every 13th iterate
thereafter: 26, 39, 52… Another starts at
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and increases in absolute value every 13th iterate thereafter: 18, 31,
44, 57… If one observes closely one see that there are smaller barely
discernible cycles of 5, 3 and 2 nested within those of length 13.

[![frac_iterate_02](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_02.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_02.png)

Figure 2 shows the next cycle of length 213 again increasing or
decreasing in absolute magnitude at every 213th iterate (marked by red
dots). Within each cycle of length 213 one can discern 16 cycles length
13.

[![frac_iterate_03](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_03.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_03.png)

Figure 3 shows the next set of cycles of length 1291 (orange) and 1504
(red). One can discern 6 cycles of length 213 in each of the 1291 length
cycles. There is a single cycle of length 1291 in that of length 1504.

[![frac_iterate_04](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_04.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frac_iterate_04.png)

Figure 4 shows even larger cycles of length 4299 (green) and 10102
(red). The former includes 2 cycles of length 1504 within it. Likewise,
the cycle of length 10102 includes 2 cycles of length 4299.

How do we derive these cycles lengths with no clear cut pattern from
first principles? For the map defined by
![k=-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the characteristic angle
![\\theta=\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{7}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B7%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the cycles correspond to the numerators of the successive rational
approximation fractions from the continued fraction representation of
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{7}\\right)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get the sequence of the cycle lengths to be:  
**2, 3, 5, 13, 213, 1291, 1504, 4299, 10102, 135625, 145727, 28135,
989783…**

More generally, when
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is not a rational sector of a circle the map shows cycles of increasing
length that are specified by the numerators of the successive rational
approximations obtained from the continued fraction for
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{\\theta}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Ctheta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

We also notice the following curious pattern typical of rational
fraction approximations for the successive cycle lengths:  
![\\begin{aligned} 5 & = & 1 & \\; \\times & 3 & \\; + & 2\\\\ 13 & = &
2 & \\; \\times & 5 & \\; + & 3\\\\ 213 & = & 16 & \\; \\times & 13 &

1504\\\\ 135625 & = & 13 & \\; \\times & 10102 & \\; + & 4299
\\end{aligned}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+5+%26+%3D+%26+1+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+3+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+2%5C%5C+13+%26+%3D+%26+2+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+5+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+3%5C%5C+213+%26+%3D+%26+16+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+13+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+5%5C%5C+1291+%26+%3D+%26+6+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+213+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+13%5C%5C+1504+%26+%3D+%26+1+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+1291+%26+%5C%3B+%2B%26+213%5C%5C+4299+%26+%3D+%26+2+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+1504+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+1291%5C%5C+10102+%26+%3D+%26+2+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+4299+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+1504%5C%5C+135625+%26+%3D+%26+13+%26+%5C%3B+%5Ctimes+%26+10102+%26+%5C%3B+%2B+%26+4299+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Let
![C_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the length of the cycle
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,

![C_n=kC\_{n-1}+C\_{n-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_n%3DkC_%7Bn-1%7D%2BC_%7Bn-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence,
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will give the number of repeats of the previous cycle
![C\_{n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are contained in
![C_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Finally, let us consider the intertwined maps of the form where we
alternate through ![\\pm
k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![x_n=\\dfrac{1}{1+ky\_{n-1}}; \\;
y_n=\\dfrac{1}{1-kx\_{n-1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Bky_%7Bn-1%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+y_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B1-kx_%7Bn-1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This alternation forces a convergence to a point ![(C_x,
C_y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28C_x%2C+C_y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Doing the algebra we can obtain,

![C_x=\\dfrac{2k+1-\\sqrt{4k^2+1)}}{2k} \\\\\[10pt\]
C_y=\\dfrac{2k-1+\\sqrt{4k^2+1)}}{2k}\\\\\[10pt\]
C_x+C_y=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_x%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2k%2B1-%5Csqrt%7B4k%5E2%2B1%29%7D%7D%7B2k%7D+%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+C_y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2k-1%2B%5Csqrt%7B4k%5E2%2B1%29%7D%7D%7B2k%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+C_x%2BC_y%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, as examples we have:  
![k=1; n \\to \\infty, \\; x_n \\to 2-\\phi; \\; y_n \\to
\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1%3B+n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+x_n+%5Cto+2-%5Cphi%3B+%5C%3B+y_n+%5Cto+%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden Ratio.

![k=2; n \\to \\infty, \\; x_n\\to \\dfrac{5-\\sqrt{17}}{4} \\approx

connections](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/12/08/some-naraya%e1%b9%87a-like-convergents-and-their-geometric-and-trigonometric-connections/)

As we headed towards the bus-stand to take our homeward conveyance, we
saw an unusual stir in its vicinity. We passed a clump of young,
well-to-do, white American women ambling along holding over-sized coffee
or cola cups and exclaiming: “Wow!” as they eagerly looked at something.
The still air was pierced by the blaring horns and the strobing lights
of the vehicles of emergency responders. Some distance from the
bus-stand was a construction site with a gigantic crane, which we passed
on our weekly trip to a store. A Mexican man, by his appearance
evidently of mostly pure First American ancestry, had fallen from his
lofty perch where he was either trimming a branch or fixing a wire,
since a bundle of power-lines hung low from a pole near which he had
been suspended. But now, like emperor Yayāti having exhausted his puṇya,
he had fallen either electrocuted or due to having lost his hold. As we
reached bus-stand, the first responders were trying to resuscitate him
and soon loaded him into their vehicle.

As we watched his fate, we thought ourselves that this man is likely
going to have his appointment with Citragupta and if he evades the
crossing of the ladder for now, the going is likely to be tough for him.
Medical care in the Big-mleccha-land is generally poor and more so for a
likely undocumented immigrant with no insurance coverage. Hence, we were
greatly surprised when a man standing beside us in the bus-stand, who
ostensibly had witnessed the whole incident from that vantage point,
said something similar with a tinge of an Eastern European accent:
“There is no American dream for that poor guy even if he survives that
one. I’m pretty sure he is a daily wage-earner and I’m don’t know how he
could support his recovery.” We nodded in assent and muttered something
about how expensive treatment could be.

That man who was standing beside us was the type who liked to talk to
strangers. Without any solicitation he took off on his autobiography.
We, not being the type who easily makes conversation with strangers,
heard him out for most part with only occasional interjections to
acknowledge our listening or to keep his flow on track. What follows is
a paraphrase of his yarn from the bus-stop to the time we got off near
our house. We record it, in part, reminded of a former student of ours
who made conversations with strangers in course of her train-commute and
wrote them down as tales.

The man was of Jewish ancestry (though he clarified that he himself was
an ‘atheist’) who hailed from what is now Ukraine but earlier part of
the sprawling Soviet Empire. He had apparently obtained a degree in
\`industrial chemistry’ and then went to the land of his peoples,
Israel, probably during the demise of the Soviet Empire. While Israel
was the land of his ancestors, he did not like it there for he said it
was too “militant” for his tastes. So after making some money there he
went to India. He gave an account of his extensive peregrinations
through India, which suggested to me that his yarn was not entirely
fictitious for what he said of the places he visited in the desh seemed
rather authentic. He even said he wanted to return to the desh to spend
a while there. From there he went back to this natal town of Odessa in
the independent Ukraine but somehow managed to convince the Americans
that he was a deserving refugee due to persecution. The Americans let
him come to the US and gave him a work permit and he soon was also able
to get a Green Card. In his first year as a refugee he did pole work —
i.e., fixing electric cables and utility poles — this was actually how
he got started with his biographical narrative. He was apparently the
only person of Jewish ancestry in this work and all his colleagues were
non-English-speaking Mexicans. While he was not as good as his
colleagues in the hard physical labor and suffered from painful but
self-treatable and auto-healing injuries, his cerebral capacity and
education allowed him to get a slightly better job in cleaning up
hazardous material.

In course of that job he was again with a body of Mexicans and
Central/South Americans, some of whom apparently did not even speak
Spanish too fluently (likely being from one of the more isolated
groups). Some of his colleagues suffered injuries from hazardous
substances in course of their work and he claimed to have used the
skills he learned in the Soviet Army training to administer them first
aid \[Footnote 1\]. The Jewish gentleman quit the job after having saved
some money as knew he was exposing himself to truly nasty stuff. He then
started working for an Iranian carpet-dealer fixing carpets but before
long he finally got a job he wanted in the fossil energy industry, which
was more in line with his education. In course of this job he apparently
traveled to all kinds of places the world-over. Now, having made a lot
of money, he leads a more sedate life. Perhaps with a sense of remorse,
he is very particular to use foot-powered and public transit. By that
time our stop had come and we left behind the ancient-mariner-like
narrator in the bus. As we got back home, we said to ourselves that
people with notable life histories perhaps want to tell it to others.

The Jewish gentleman interspersed his winding reminiscence with some
other remarks. He said more than once that he has always been bothered
about the inequality in the world. He said that his experience in
pre-independent Ukraine had made him lose faith in socialism as a
solution to it. His experience in Israel and post-Soviet Ukraine made
him doubtful of “organized religion” and nationalism. On learning we
were not a Christian, he added that he found the Americans to be to
following a “Dark-age version of Christianity not far from Islam”, which
probably inspires some of the harsh laws and law-enforcement in the
land. But he added that he did not say this to the Christian Americans
because they might think him to be an atheist Jewish intellectual
undermining the religion of Christ. America had made him realize that
capitalism is after not too great either, especially if you are in the
shoes of one of his Mexican fellow workers from his early days in the
US. He felt scientific education might be the way out because that is
how he “made it”, whereas his Mexican and Central/South American friends
are probably still struggling in their lives unable to afford, a good
house, medicines and treatment. But again he quickly added that he did
not want to interfere in other peoples personal lives — implying that
religion was basically a personal thing.

There are some aspects of gentleman’s experience and conclusions we can
commiserate with. That apart, one key aspect that seemed to mystify him
was human inequality to which he felt there must exist some solution —
just that we had not reached it yet. A lot of people around the world
are unable to come to terms with inequality as an inherent feature of
humans. Those who are better endowed in one dimension or the other than
their fellow men see this sooner or later. But the effect of the
pratyakṣa is different on different people:

-   Some realize that voicing it aloud will only prove too dangerous for
    their own safety for those who lack their special gift might get
    jealous of them and try to destroy them. Hence, they knowingly deny
    the existence of the difference and attribute it to something else
    (e.g. the Lebanese thinker Taleb). The more pernicious among the
    deniers would say that it is because of the lack of human effort on
    part of the less-endowed.
-   Since special ability comes from something very innate it looks very
    natural, just as other innate processes such as feeding or
    urinating. Hence, some are unable to understand that others might
    not be able to do such natural things. Hence, they insist that their
    special deeds should be easy for all — they just need to keep
    trying.
-   Yet others sense the differences to be inherently dangerous and want
    to eliminate them either by destroying those above them or those
    under them. This is their idea of literally leveling the playing
    field. Such tendencies have taken root in an ironic and euphemistic
    garb in the US and other Anglophone parts of the leukosphere. It is
    passed off using various terms falling under the rubric of social
    justice. Given the deep intellectual resonance, affinity and perhaps
    even unilateral love for this part of the leukosphere among part of
    the Indian elite with, they too are imbibing these ideas to their
    detriment.

In the end one has to admit that a part of the experience of the Jewish
gentleman or anyone else who has reached the shores of the
big-mleccha-land to live there for a substantial period of time relates
to it still being a frontier society (to borrow the naturalist-thinker
E.O. Wilson’s term) with vast natural resources. Once such a frontier
mindset takes over the population, we see its effects in various aspects
of life, even if the land looks superficially urbanized. For example,
few Americans find it strange that their land for most part has no good
public transport to talk off. Few find it strange that one has to get
into an over-sized car and guzzle gas to get to a place on the horizon
to just to obtain ones groceries or to go to where one needs to do to
earn daily bread. A few find it strange that one needs to drive more
than a mile to a place where one exercises in something called a “gym”.
No one seems to raise an eyebrow about living in a large isolated house,
where one might barely know or interact with others outside the nuclear
family in a non-structured way \[Of course there are places which are
exceptions but those are very few\]. Indeed, with such a land in the
temperate zone where infectious disease is relatively low, and with
restrictive laws, a fraudulent triangle of physicians, pharmaceutical
industries and insurance companies can make a quick buck. Thus, like a
true frontier-land it is truly a place where the going is good as long
as one is physically strong.

In such a frontier-land there are dangerous jobs to be done. But if you
lead a large existence yourself you need those jobs to be done for cheap
to sustain your own lifestyle. In the past this was achieved by
importing slaves from Africa to do all the dangerous stuff free of cost.
Today the Mexican and Central/South Americans play this role. When
confronted with these issues a well-heeled white American gentleman, a
type that cheers at “amazing” TED talks, said that artificial
intelligence combined with a universal income policy will be the
solution. But he misses that point that AI that will merely cut out the
jobs now done mostly by these people of First American ancestry. In fact
it is not just them. There are a large number of Indians too want to
join their ranks and sneak into US from the southern border. The reality
is in the event of AI and automation actually delivering the promise,
the life of such seekers will probably be worse off (and I’m no
luddite). And a universal income policy is little more than a foggy
figment.

In the end, a lot of those who are bothered by the issue of human
inequality are often attracted towards “cool” solutions rather than
realizing that the main reason these people are flocking to the US to do
even the most dangerous jobs is probably just the lure of the frontier
where they hope they might get a better life than in their own lands.
Often this better is not something fancy but about water and energy —
these are two things that cannot be easily solved by just imparting
“scientific temper” to the populace. Thus, locally addressing water and
energy issues can go a long way in people fulfilling their innate
potentials (which is actually a good state) but the inequality is not
going just vanish. Further, the nature of pyramid schemes are often
missed by people, both with low or high IQs: those who reach the
frontier lands first are going to get much more out of it than those who
come later. Thus, no place has endless space for everyone to try the
same strategy. Of course those with a higher IQ are likely to quickly
display a new strategy that might earn them better returns as things get
competitive but the basic nature of a pyramid scheme does not go away.

There is no samatvam but a certain sambhāva, saṃyama, and suvṛtti might
help. But in the end people need to come to terms that there are some
divides which might simply to wide to span with bridges. This of course
will be difficult for the typical Occidental “intellectual” of the day
and his fellow travelers to grasp in the current atmosphere.

Footnote 1: Here we could add that we are aware of an Indian
hazardous-waste-cleanup-contractor who employed Mexican and South
American workers. He mentioned how he had to once prevent his workers

While playing with an iterative geometric construction in our youth we
discovered for ourselves a particular right triangle whose sides are in
the proportion ![1: \\sqrt{\\phi} :
\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%3A+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D+%3A+%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![\\phi=
\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden Ratio. This triangle is of course famous as being the
basis of the largest triangles of the Śrīyantra and the Tripuraśekhara-
(Bālā-) yantra of the [Śrīkula
tradition](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/10/06/the-minimal-triangle-circumscribing-a-semicircle/)
and also the famous [Great
Pyramid](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/some-meanderings-among-golden-stuff/)
of the ancient Egyptians. Revisiting it, we were able to provide the
trigonometric proof for our construction, which in turn led several
sequences of interest. The construction goes thus (Figure 1):

1\) Start with an isosceles right triangle ![\\triangle
AOB](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+AOB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![\\triangle
A'OB](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+A%27OB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
whose equal sides are 1 each and hypotenuse is
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
2) Slide the hypotenuse down to point
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
create a segment equal to it in length
![\\overline{OC_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOC_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Join point
![C_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) Draw a perpendicular to
![\\overline{C_1B}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BC_1B%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to meet the base line
![\\overleftrightarrow{AC_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BAC_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to meet it at
![C_1'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Joint
![C_1'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to create a right triangle ![\\triangle
C_1'OB](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+C_1%27OB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) Draw a segment equal to the hypotenuse
![\\overline{C_1'B}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BC_1%27B%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of this new triangle along the baseline
![\\overleftrightarrow{AC_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BAC_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get a point at the distance equal to
![\\overline{C_1'B}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BC_1%27B%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
5) Iterate the above steps with this point.

What will happen if you keep iterating thus? We learned to our surprise
in our youth that it converges to a right triangle ![\\triangle
K_1BK_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+K_1BK_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(shaded yellow in Figure 1), whose sides will be ![(\\sqrt{\\phi},
\\phi,
\\phi^{3/2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D%2C+%5Cphi%2C+%5Cphi%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further the altitude
![\\overline{OB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will divide the hypotenuse into segments
![\\overline{OK_1}=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOK_1%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\overline{OK_1}=\\sqrt{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOK_1%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The trigonometric proof we obtained for this is rather simple. It
essential comprises of finding the attractor of the following map:

![x\_{n+1}=\\cos\\left(\\arctan(x_n)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%28x_n%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
where
![x_0=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\cos\\left(\\arctan(x)\\right) =
\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%28x%29%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1%2Bx%5E2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore x_1=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}}; \\; x_2= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{3}};
\\; x_3= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{5}}; \\;
x_4=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{5}{8}}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+x_1%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+x_2%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+x_3%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B5%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+x_4%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B5%7D%7B8%7D%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Given the mātrā-meru-paṅkti: ![f\[1\]=1, f\[2\]=2,
f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n-2\];
x_n=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{f\[n\]}{f\[n+1\]}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3D1%2C+f%5B2%5D%3D2%2C+f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D%3B+x_n%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D%7Bf%5Bn%2B1%5D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\displaystyle \\therefore \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty} x_n=
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{\\phi}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ctherefore+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+x_n%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One can see that the
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of this map corresponds to the bases of the right-side triangles in
successive steps (Figure 1), starting with ![\\overline{OA},
\\overline{OC_1'}...\\overline{OK_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOA%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BOC_1%27%7D...%5Coverline%7BOK_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![\\overline{OK_1}=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\phi}} \\;\\;\\;
\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOK_1%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D%7D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%5C%3B+_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, we specify a similar map of the form:

![y\_{n+1}=\\sin\\left(\\arctan(y_n)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%28y_n%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
where
![y_1=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_1%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Given that ![\\sin\\left(\\arctan(y)\\right)
=\\tfrac{y}{\\sqrt{1+y^2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%28y%29%5Cright%29+%3D%5Ctfrac%7By%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1%2By%5E2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the sequence:

![y_2=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}; \\; y_3=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}; \\;
y_4=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}... \\;
y_n=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_2%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+y_3%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%3B+%5C%3B+y_4%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B4%7D%7D...+%5C%3B+y_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, ![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}
x_n=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+x_n%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Inspired by the above, we define the below intertwined maps that
generate interesting sequences and convergents:

**Map 1**  
![x\_{n+1}=\\cos\\left(\\arctan\\left( x_n\\right) \\right); \\;
x_0=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%5Cleft%28+x_n%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29%3B+%5C%3B+x_0%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![y\_{n+1}=\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(
x\_{n+1}\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here, as ![n \\to \\infty\\;\\; x\_{n} \\to \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\phi}},
\\; y\_{n} \\to
\\dfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%5C%3B%5C%3B+x_%7Bn%7D+%5Cto+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D%7D%2C+%5C%3B+y_%7Bn%7D+%5Cto+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We see that ![x_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}};
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{3}}; \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{5}};
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{5}{8}}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n+%5Crightarrow+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B5%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B5%7D%7B8%7D%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![y_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{3}}; \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{5}};
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{8}};
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{5}{13}}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n+%5Crightarrow+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B5%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B8%7D%7D%3B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B5%7D%7B13%7D%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

It is apparent that these sequences are constructed from consecutive or
every second term of the mātrā-meru-paṅkti.

**Map 2**  
![x\_{n+1}=\\cos\\left(\\arctan\\left( y_n\\right) \\right); \\;

![y\_{n+1}=\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(
x\_{n+1}\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here, as ![n \\to \\infty\\;\\; x\_{n} \\to \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt\[4\]{2}},
\\; y\_{n} \\to
\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{2}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%5C%3B%5C%3B+x_%7Bn%7D+%5Cto+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%5B4%5D%7B2%7D%7D%2C+%5C%3B+y_%7Bn%7D+%5Cto+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We see that ![x_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}},
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{4}}, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{7}{10}},
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{17}{24}}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n+%5Crightarrow+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%7D%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B7%7D%7B10%7D%7D%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B17%7D%7B24%7D%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This sequence can be derived from the sequence ![\\textbf{1, 2, 3, 4, 7,
10, 17,
24...}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7B1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+7%2C+10%2C+17%2C+24...%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which has ![f\[1\]=1,
f\[2\]=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3D1%2C+f%5B2%5D%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and alternating terms of the form ![f\[n+1\]=f\[n\]+f\[n-1\],
f\[n+1\]=f\[n\]+f\[n-2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%2B1%5D%3Df%5Bn%5D%2Bf%5Bn-1%5D%2C+f%5Bn%2B1%5D%3Df%5Bn%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Further, we have ![y_n \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{3}},
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{3}{7}},
\\sqrt{\\dfrac{7}{17}}....](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n+%5Crightarrow+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%7D%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B7%7D%7D%2C+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B7%7D%7B17%7D%7D....&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One notices that it is constructed from the above integer sequence by
taking the square root of the ratio of ever second term.

**Map 3**  
![x\_{n+1}=\\cos\\left(\\arctan\\left(y_n\\right) \\right); \\;

where
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the convergent of [Nārāyaṇa’s

(known in the Occident as the tribonacci constant)

We see that ![x_n \\rightarrow 1, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{2}},

Here,
![\\lambda_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Further,

Then
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

**Rational points on a unit circle**  
There are some events that happen in the course of ones life that might
be considered historical or world-changing. One such event from our
lifetime is the proving of the Last Theorem of Fermat (FLT). While the
proof of the FLT is inaccessible to persons with meager mathematical
understanding like us, its algebraic form can be understood by anyone
with a very limited knowledge of mathematics. Its geometric form is
deeply linked to a basic aspect of Euclidean space, and it was this form
that amazed us as a kid. This can be presented as a very simple problem:
given the curve ![x^n+y^n=1; \\; n=1, 2,
3,...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5En%2By%5En%3D1%3B+%5C%3B+n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3%2C...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1), are there rational points that lie on the curve? A rational
point is a point
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where both
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are rational numbers.

These curves may be divided two topologically distinct groups based on
the parity of the exponent
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If ![n=2k+1; k=0, 1,
2...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2k%2B1%3B+k%3D0%2C+1%2C+2...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the curve is bilaterally symmetric about
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and cuts the x-axis and the y-axis once at
![(1,0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![(0,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
respectively (Figure 1). If instead ![n=2k+2; k=0, 1,
2...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2k%2B2%3B+k%3D0%2C+1%2C+2...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the curve is closed, symmetric about both axes and the lines ![y =
\\pm
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+%5Cpm+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
and cuts the the x-axis and the y-axis twice at ![(\\pm 1,
0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cpm+1%2C+0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![(0, \\pm
1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C+%5Cpm+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
respectively (Figure 1). It is easy to see that the case where
![n=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has infinite rational points. The case for
![n=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
defines a circle and that too has infinite rational points on it (see
below). Remarkably, the FLT states that there are no rational points for
any of the curves with ![n \\ge
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cge+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
other than of course the trivial points where the curve cuts the axes.
This is a rather profound statement regarding the geometry of Euclidean
space as it means that, other than the line
![x+y=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the unit circle, none of other members of this family of unit curves
can ever pass through non-trivial rational points.

Now, what are the rational points on a circle? These are linked to the
defining theorem of Euclidean space — the theorem of the right triangle
or the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya: we have for a right triangle with the
three sides ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in order of length,  
![a^2+b^2=c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%3Dc%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Dividing the equation by
![c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:  
![\\dfrac{a^2}{c^2}+\\dfrac{b^2}{c^2}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5E2%7D%7Bc%5E2%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bb%5E2%7D%7Bc%5E2%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Writing
![\\tfrac{a}{c}=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bc%7D%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\tfrac{b}{c}=y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3Dy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the equation of the unit circle:  
![x^2+y^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2By%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Therefore, the primitive right-triangle triples
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(because they are
![90^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles), where
![\\textrm{GCD}(a,b,c)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
define the rational points on a unit circle of the form ![\\left(
\\tfrac{a}{c},
\\tfrac{b}{c}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28+%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bc%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It has been known since antiquity that the right triangle triples have a
deep connection to the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Thus,
given two positive integers ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
if
![\\textrm{GCD}(u,v)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%28u%2Cv%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![v>u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%3Eu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we can generate triples using the below formulae (something one learns
by secondary school):

![x=v^2-u^2\\\\\[6pt\] y=2uv\\\\\[6pt\]
z=u^2+v^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dv%5E2-u%5E2%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+y%3D2uv%5C%5C%5B6pt%5D+z%3Du%5E2%2Bv%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For example, ![u=1,
v=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D1%2C+v%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yield ![3, 4,
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the most primitive of all
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. It figures in many ancient holy objects like the Śrīcakra or in
the layout of the city of Ayodhyā. However, if both ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are odd then
![v^2-u^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%5E2-u%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![2uv](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2uv&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![u^2+v^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%5E2%2Bv%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will all be even. Hence, they cannot constitute a primitive
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple: e.g. ![u=1,
v=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D1%2C+v%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will yield ![6, 8,
10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6%2C+8%2C+10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is simply the ![3, 4,
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle magnified 2 times. Thus, we need an additional condition so
that we consider only those triples generated by the above formulae
which themselves have ![\\textrm{GCD}(v^2-u^2, 2uv,
u^2+v^2)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%28v%5E2-u%5E2%2C+2uv%2C+u%5E2%2Bv%5E2%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we eliminate all ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
sharing an odd parity. Given that the above procedure ensures that
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be positive, if we further ensure that the sides are arranged by
increasing order of length then the minimal set of primitive triples,
![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
will necessarily occupy only the octant of a circle between
![\\left\[\\tfrac{\\pi}{4},\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%5B%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D%2C%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2). This set of primitive triples
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can then be used to get rational points on the entire perimeter of the
circle by placing
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
before
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and changing their signs one at a time.

Figure 2. ![T\_{90} \\le

The above procedure shows that there are infinite
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples (Figure 2 shows those with ![c \\le
10000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+10000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
and thus there are infinite rational points that lie on a unit circle.
However, for the past 80 or so years it has been known that there is a
hierarchy to the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples with the ![T^0\_{90}=(3, 4,
5)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%5E0_%7B90%7D%3D%283%2C+4%2C+5%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple being the mother of all of them. We represent it as the below
matrix:

![T^0\_{90}=\\begin{bmatrix} 3\\\\ 4\\\\ 5\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%5E0_%7B90%7D%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+3%5C%5C+4%5C%5C+5%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We then define 3 transformation matrices:

![M_1= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 & 3 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+2+%26+2+%5C%5C+2+%26+1+%26+2+%5C%5C+2+%26+2+%26+3+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![M_2= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -2 & 3 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_2%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+-2+%26+2+%5C%5C+2+%26+-1+%26+2+%5C%5C+2+%26+-2+%26+3+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![M_3= \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 2 \\\\ -2 & 2 & 3 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_3%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+-1+%26+2+%26+2+%5C%5C+-2+%26+1+%26+2+%5C%5C+-2+%26+2+%26+3+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Then we get three further generation-1 triples from
![\\mathbf{T^{0}\_{90}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BT%5E%7B0%7D_%7B90%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
thus:

![\\mathbf{T^{1.1}\_{90}=M_1 \\cdot T^0\_{90}; \\; T^{1.2}\_{90}=M_2
\\cdot T^0\_{90}; \\; T^{1.3}\_{90}=M_3 \\cdot
T^0\_{90}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BT%5E%7B1.1%7D_%7B90%7D%3DM_1+%5Ccdot+T%5E0_%7B90%7D%3B+%5C%3B+T%5E%7B1.2%7D_%7B90%7D%3DM_2+%5Ccdot+T%5E0_%7B90%7D%3B+%5C%3B+T%5E%7B1.3%7D_%7B90%7D%3DM_3+%5Ccdot+T%5E0_%7B90%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

These ![(20, 21, 29); (5, 12, 13); (8, 15,
17)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2820%2C+21%2C+29%29%3B+%285%2C+12%2C+13%29%3B+%288%2C+15%2C+17%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
represent the next level in the hierarchy of primitive triples. From
those 3 we get a further generations of 9 and then 27 and so on by
multiplying each triple of the previous generation by each of the
transformation matrices. What serial multiplication by
![\\mathbf{M_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
does is to create right triangles approaching the half-square or
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![45^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=45%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. Thus, in the lineage of multiplication by
![M_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get triangles such that

![\\textrm{AM}\\left( \\dfrac{c}{a}, \\dfrac{c}{b} \\right)
\\to\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BAM%7D%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bc%7D%7Ba%7D%2C+%5Cdfrac%7Bc%7D%7Bb%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cto%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For example, ![(119, 120,
169)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28119%2C+120%2C+169%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the 2nd generation triple in the
![\\mathbf{M_1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM_1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lineage yields ![\\textrm{AM}\\left( \\tfrac{169}{119},
\\tfrac{169}{120} \\right) =
1.414251](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BAM%7D%5Cleft%28+%5Ctfrac%7B169%7D%7B119%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B169%7D%7B120%7D+%5Cright%29+%3D+1.414251&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which approximates
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
correctly to 4 decimal places. In contrast, the matrices
![\\mathbf{M_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\mathbf{M_3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM_3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
drive the triangles towards the state where one of the sides and the
hypotenuse are nearly equal. When we plot the rational points generated
by the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples on the unit circle we get a fractal structure covering the
primary octant of the said circle (Figure 3).  
[![triples_bbk_on_circ](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/triples_bbk_on_circ.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/triples_bbk_on_circ.png)Figure
3. Rational points on the unit circle derived from
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples with those derived from the primordial triple ![(3, 4,
5)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C+4%2C+5%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and 3 subsequent generations of triples indicated by disks of decreasing
size.

This structure is characterized by “zones of exclusion” defined by the
high-ranked triples. The biggest such zone is defined by the primordial
![(3, 4,
5)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C+4%2C+5%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple, followed by those of generation-1 and so on (Figure 3). However,
if one zooms in on the smaller zones of exclusion one sees a fractal
structure mirroring the larger zones.

If we order the triples by the ascending value of
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then we get a remarkable relationship for the count of triples with
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
below or equal to a certain number
![N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![\\dfrac{\\#(a, b, c \\le N)}{N} \\simeq
\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5C%23%28a%2C+b%2C+c+%5Cle+N%29%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csimeq+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This famous result of the senior Derrick Lehmer, which can be easily
numerically visualized (Figure 4), has links to Leonhard Euler’s
discovery of the
![\\zeta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Czeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function.

[![triples90_pi](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/triples90_pi.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/triples90_pi.png)Figure

Its formal proof is complicated (for the mathematical layman) and yields
an additional logarithmic term. However, the basic concept leading to to
Lehmer’s asymptotic result is readily understood. Euler had famously
shown that the probability of two randomly chosen positive integers ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
having
![\\textrm{GCD}(u,v)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%28u%2Cv%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. being mutually prime, is
![\\tfrac{1}{\\zeta(2)}=\\tfrac{6}{\\pi^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Czeta%282%29%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B%5Cpi%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In the above formula for obtaining
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples we start with two mutually prime integers ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the probability of getting two such mutually prime integers is
defined by this formula of Euler. The hypotenuse
![c=u^2+v^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3Du%5E2%2Bv%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence, we can see the points defined by ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for all ![c \\le
N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lying inside or on a circle with radius
![\\sqrt{N}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and area ![\\pi
N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, we do not consider the entire circle; as we saw above, because
of the ordering and sign considerations we only account for one octant
of a circle, i.e.
![\\tfrac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of its total area. Hence, we get the number of points defined by the
mutually prime ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such that ![u^2+v^2 \\le
N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%5E2%2Bv%5E2+%5Cle+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be ![\\tfrac{6}{\\pi^2} \\cdot \\pi N \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{8} =
\\tfrac{3}{4
\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B%5Cpi%5E2%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cpi+N+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4+%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, not all these points correspond to valid triples. As we saw
above, we have to exclude triples emerging from mutually prime ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are both odd. This approximately eliminates
![\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the possible mutually prime couplings (e.g. for 1, 2, 3, we have 1, 2
and 2, 3 as valid couplings but 1,3 is not). Therefore, we have multiply
the value ![\\tfrac{3}{4
\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4+%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by a correction factor of
![\\tfrac{2}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
leading to the above asymptotic formula of Lehmer.

ellipses**  
Our exploration of this special class of rational points on an ellipse
and its links to integer triangles began in our youth when we added an
important lesson to our very rudimentary knowledge of trigonometry. It
stemmed from a simple question that anyone with limited amount of
geometric knowledge can ask: Are there any other triangles with an angle
defined by a rational sector of a circle (i.e. the angle is rational in
degrees) that have a regular formula (like the right triangle) relating
their sides? In course of our compass and ruler constructions on paper,
we stumbled across the ![(3, 5,
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C+5%2C+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple which defines a
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle (Figure 5).

Figure 5. ![(3, 5,
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C+5%2C+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
defines a
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle with sides obeying the formula
![a^2+ab+b^2=c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bab%2Bb%5E2%3Dc%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Since at that point we knew of the properties of the famous Platonic
![30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D-60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D-90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle, we were able to prove using the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya that if
a triangle’s sides are 3, 5, 7 then indeed it has an angle of
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
While doing so it struck us that ![7^2=3^2+5^2+3 \\times
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=7%5E2%3D3%5E2%2B5%5E2%2B3+%5Ctimes+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and we were able to visualize the same geometrically (Figure 5). We then
became curious if we could find other integer
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles to see if this relationship held. Having drawn a
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
angle on paper, using a sliding ruler we soon obtained another
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle defined by the triple ![7, 8,
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=7%2C+8%2C+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and found that here again ![7^2+8^2+7 \\times
8=13^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=7%5E2%2B8%5E2%2B7+%5Ctimes+8%3D13%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This sparked our curiosity and we looked up one of our father’s
mathematics books to see if this was recorded. While we did not find it
there, we learned of the generalization of the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya,
the cosine rule,
![a^2+b^2-ab\\cos(C)=c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bb%5E2-ab%5Ccos%28C%29%3Dc%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We were able to grasp its implications right away because our father had
introduced us to the trigonometric functions early in life. Thus, it
became clear that
![a^2+b^2+ab=c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%2Bab%3Dc%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
was indeed a property of
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles stemming directly from the cosine rule given that
![\\cos(120^{\\circ})=-\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%28120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%29%3D-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Further, this implied that we can have such regular formulae only for
one other rational sector triangle, i.e. the
![60^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. Only the rational sectors corresponding to ![0^{\\circ},
60^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}, 120^{\\circ},
180^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+180%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
have rational cosines. Of these only ![60^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ},
120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D%2C+120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can form non-degenerate triangles. These correspond to the formulae:

![\\begin{aligned} 60^{\\circ} &\\rightarrow& a^2+b^2&-ab&=c^2\\\\
90^{\\circ} &\\rightarrow& a^2+b^2& &=c^2\\\\ 120^{\\circ}
&\\rightarrow& a^2+b^2&+ab&=c^2
\\end{aligned}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D+%26%5Crightarrow%26+a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%26-ab%26%3Dc%5E2%5C%5C+90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D+%26%5Crightarrow%26+a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%26+%26%3Dc%5E2%5C%5C+120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D+%26%5Crightarrow%26+a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%26%2Bab%26%3Dc%5E2+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

While for the
![90^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=90%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
case the additive formulae imply that that the side
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the largest side, the negative term in the
![60^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
case implies that
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the middle length side of the triangle.

triangle

While the FLT shows that there can be no relationship between 3 rational
cubes like for squares, the
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![60^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
provide a 3-dimensional relationship to the difference and summation of
volumes of cubes and a square-faced cuboid.

![b^3-a^3=(b-a)c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5E3-a%5E3%3D%28b-a%29c%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the difference of the volumes of 2 cubes with edges equal to each
of the two short sides of a
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle ![(a,
b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2C+b%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is equal to a cuboid with a base equal to a square erected on the long
side of the said triangle
![(c)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28c%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and height equal to the difference of the other two sides
![(a-b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a-b%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

![a^3+b^3=(a+b)c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E3%2Bb%5E3%3D%28a%2Bb%29c%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the sum of the volumes of 2 cubes with edges respectively equal to
the shortest and longest sides of a
![60^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2C+b%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is equal to a cuboid with a base equal to a square erected on the middle
side of the said triangle
![(c)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28c%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![(a+b)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Bb%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Further, we observed that by dividing the above equations by
![c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and writing ![x=\\tfrac{a}{c}; y=

we get equations of the ellipses

7. The ellipses defined by the rational triangle triples

The above implies that the primitive integer triples corresponding to
the
![120^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle,
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
define rational points that lie on the ellipse
![x^2+xy+y^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2Bxy%2By%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and those corresponding to the
![60^{\\circ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples,
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
define the rational points on the ellipse
![x^2-xy+y^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-xy%2By%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 7). These are special ellipses whose eccentricity and semi-minor
axis are equal to the same value,
![\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, they have an aspect ratio of
![\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We shall see below that certain numbers related to parameters of these
ellipses play a role in certain in the counts of primitive
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![60^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
integer triangles.

Further, by means of a geometric construction we can show that for each
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
there 2 corresponding
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that can be derived from it, which share the lengths of 2 sides with the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle (Figure 8). This construction stems from the dissection of an
equilateral triangle into 3 triangles such that one of them will again
be equilateral (Figure 8). Thus, the primitive equilateral triangle
![(1,1,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
defines a distinct primitive
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

As with the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
family of triangle triples we can derive a formula for constructing the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples using two mutually prime integers ![u, v; u \>
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v%3B+u+%3E+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![x= u^2-v^2 y= 2uv+v^2 z=
u^2+uv+v^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D+u%5E2-v%5E2+y%3D+2uv%2Bv%5E2+z%3D+u%5E2%2Buv%2Bv%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Since these are necessarily scalene triangles, we order the triple ![(x,
y,
z)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%2C+z%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such that elements are in ascending order and then term them ![(a, b,
c); a\<b\<
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2C+b%2C+c%29%3B+a%3Cb%3C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, in order to get primitive triples, we have to again ensure that
the ![\\textrm{GCD}( u^2-v^2, 2uv+v^2,
u^2+uv+v^2)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%28+u%5E2-v%5E2%2C+2uv%2Bv%5E2%2C+u%5E2%2Buv%2Bv%5E2%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, ![u=4;
v=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D4%3B+v%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
while mutually prime and yield the triple ![(9, 15,
21)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%289%2C+15%2C+21%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which has
![\\textrm{GCD}=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGCD%7D%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, it is merely the first triple ![(3, 5,
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C+5%2C+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
magnified 3 times. Hence, we have to drop such cases. Once we perform
this operation on the result of above formula we can get primitive
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. The first few are shown in Table 1.

If we plot the independent values ![a,

![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(panel 3).

Because of the defining relationship
![a^2+ab+b^2=c^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bab%2Bb%5E2%3Dc%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

transformation matrix
![\\mathbf{M}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for these triples. Unlike the trifurcating matrices for the right
triangle triples this one merely converts one primitive triple in to
another with no particular hierarchy:

![M= \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 3 & 4\\\\ 3 & 4 & 4\\\\ 6 & 6 & 7\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+4+%26+3+%26+4%5C%5C+3+%26+4+%26+4%5C%5C+6+%26+6+%26+7%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If ![T\_{120}^0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 7 \\\\

![\\mathbf{M \\cdot

![T\_{120}^{14} = \\begin{bmatrix} 55 \\\\ 57 \\\\ 97 \\\\

We observe that the multiplication of
![\\mathbf{M}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BM%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
drives the triples towards the sides of a ![30^\\circ - 30^\\circ -
120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30%5E%5Ccirc+-+30%5E%5Ccirc+-+120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. Thus, for the triples generated by this multiplication we have
an arithmetic mean relationship comparable to the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples:

![\\textrm{AM}\\left(\\dfrac{c}{a}, \\dfrac{c}{b} \\right) \\to

In terms of the location of the rational points corresponding to the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples we see a fractal structure of “zones of inhibition” just as with
the right-triangle triples. However, there is no obvious pattern beyond
the higher ranked triples being associated with stronger zones of
inhibition (Figure 10).

triples.

As with the right triangles we can ask what will be counts of
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples with ![c \\le
N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)?
We empirically ascertained it to be (Figure 11):

![\\dfrac{\\#(a, b, c \\le N)}{N} \\simeq
\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{4\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5C%23%28a%2C+b%2C+c+%5Cle+N%29%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csimeq+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B4%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Following the idea behind Lehmer’s proof for the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples, we can see that just as in that case the bounding curve of the
triple-generating coprime
![u,v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2Cv&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a circle of radius
![N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
for
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples it is an ellipse of the form
![x^2+xy+y^2=N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2Bxy%2By%5E2%3DN&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One can see that this has a shape corresponding to
![x^2+xy+y^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2Bxy%2By%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 7, 9, panel 2). The area of this ellipse is ![\\tfrac{2 N
\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2+N+%5Cpi%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 7). When the triples are in ascending order they only map to the
sector of the ellipse from
![x=0..\\sqrt{\\tfrac{N}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0..%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7BN%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The explicit equation of the ellipse is ![y= \\tfrac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{4N -
3x^2} -
x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28%5Csqrt%7B4N+-+3x%5E2%7D+-+x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, we can find the area occupied by the ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to the ordered
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples thus:

![\\displaystyle
\\int\_{0}^{\\sqrt{\\frac{N}{3}}}\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{4N-3x^{2}}-x\\right)dx\\
-\\frac{N}{6}= \\dfrac{N
\\pi}{6\\sqrt{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7B3%7D%7D%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B4N-3x%5E%7B2%7D%7D-x%5Cright%29dx%5C+-%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7B6%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7BN+%5Cpi%7D%7B6%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is just
![\\tfrac{1}{12}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B12%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the total area of the ellipse. Further, we have to apply a correction
factor as we are only considering primitive triples; some of the coprime
![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yield the same triple when reduced. If we take first 4 coprime pairs
(2,1); (3,1); (3,2); (4,1) get the 4 triples (3,5,7); (7,8,13); (5, 16,
19); (9, 15, 21). Of these the last is not primitive being equivalent to
the first. Thus, we keep approximately only
![\\tfrac{3}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the triples coming from coprime
![(u,v)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28u%2Cv%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the approximate number of primitive
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples such that ![\\#(a, b, c \\le N)= \\tfrac{6}{\\pi^2} \\cdot
\\tfrac{N \\pi}{6\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot
\\tfrac{3}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%23%28a%2C+b%2C+c+%5Cle+N%29%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B%5Cpi%5E2%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7BN+%5Cpi%7D%7B6%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which leads to the above result for the count of
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples.

We saw above that each
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple generates 2
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. Thus, the asymptotic count of
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples would be twice that of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. Further, given the specific geometric relationship between the
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle and its two

triangle children, the longest side
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the
![120^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=120%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle (Figure 8) is the middle side
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the two
![60^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
children triangles if we consider their sides ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the ascending order. Hence, to observe the this relationship in the
asymptotic counts we need to sort the
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples by the middle side
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is the equivalent of
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples (Figure 12). This is also apparent from the sector of the
ellipse
![x^2-xy+y^2=N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-xy%2By%5E2%3DN&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
occupied by the coprime
![u,v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2Cv&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
giving rise to the
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples (Figure 7, 9). This corresponds to the sector of the ellipse
defined by
![x=0..\\sqrt{N}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0..%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By integrating between those limits one can see that the sector has
twice the area of sector occupied by the
![u,v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2Cv&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If we instead order the

triples by their longest sides
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then we get the below relationship for their asymptotic counts:

![\\dfrac{\\#(a, b, c \\le N)}{N} \\simeq
\\dfrac{9\\log(3)}{4\\pi^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5C%23%28a%2C+b%2C+c+%5Cle+N%29%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csimeq+%5Cdfrac%7B9%5Clog%283%29%7D%7B4%5Cpi%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This can be empirically verified (Figure 13) and explained thus: If
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the longest side then the relationship between the individual

y=\\tfrac{b}{c}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bc%7D%2C+y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the hyperbola
![y^2=x^2-x+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E2-x%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This hyperbola will determine the shape of the bounding curve of the
coprime ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
generating
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples with ![c \\le
N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 9, panel 3). The actual equation of the bounding curve will be
![y^2=x^2-\\sqrt{N}x+N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E2-%5Csqrt%7BN%7Dx%2BN&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the generating ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be contained in an area corresponding to the sector of this
hyperbola from
![x=0..\\sqrt{N}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0..%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 9, panel 3). We can get that area thus:

![\\displaystyle \\int\_{0}^{\\sqrt{N}}\\sqrt{x^{2}-\\sqrt{N}x+N}\\
dx-\\frac{N}{2}= \\dfrac{N}{2}+\\dfrac{3N\\log(3)}{8} - \\dfrac{N}{2} =
\\dfrac{3N\\log(3)}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%5Csqrt%7Bx%5E%7B2%7D-%5Csqrt%7BN%7Dx%2BN%7D%5C+dx-%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7B2%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7BN%7D%7B2%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B3N%5Clog%283%29%7D%7B8%7D+-+%5Cdfrac%7BN%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B3N%5Clog%283%29%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence, in this case we get the approximate number of primitive
![T\_{60}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B60%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples such that ![\\#(a, b, c \\le N)= \\tfrac{6}{\\pi^2} \\cdot
\\tfrac{3N\\log(3)}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%23%28a%2C+b%2C+c+%5Cle+N%29%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B6%7D%7B%5Cpi%5E2%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B3N%5Clog%283%29%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is the above result.

**Divisibility and composition of triples**  
The triples illustrate a deep link between geometry and arithmetic in
terms of their divisibility and composition. Some of these facts have
probably been known since antiquity for the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. One trivial feature is that all the odd numbers will be
represented among the shortest sides for both the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. Since adjacent odd and even numbers are coprime, and thus valid
![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for generating the shortest side
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
they give rise to the odd numbers because the difference of the squares
of two adjacent numbers is an odd number
![2n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Less trivially, in the case of the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples we also get the multiples of 4 starting from 8 onward as the
shortest side
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This happens when we have even numbers couple with 1 (being naturally
coprime), such as ![u=4,
v=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D4%2C+v%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Here
![b=u^2-v^2=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3Du%5E2-v%5E2%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![a=2uv=8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2uv%3D8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
similarly, ![u=6,
v=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D6%2C+v%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would yield ![b=35,
a=12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D35%2C+a%3D12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and so on. In the case of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples we similarly have in addition to the odd numbers, all multiples
of 8 from 16 onward. These come from consecutive odd numbers, which
being coprime can be valid ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to generate
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples. Thus, ![u=2n+1,
v=2n+3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D2n%2B1%2C+v%3D2n%2B3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yields
![a=8(n+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D8%28n%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which from the
![n=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
onward will yield 16, 24…

A further relationship is related to the hypotenuse
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of a primitive
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple: it is always an integer of the form
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This can be understood thusly: Given ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the coprime generators of a primitive triple let them be respectively
odd and even coprime numbers. We can write
![u=2k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D2k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![v=2j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%3D2j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
![\\therefore c=u^2+v^2 = 4k^2+ 4k+ 1+ 4j^2=
4(k^2+k+j^2)+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+c%3Du%5E2%2Bv%5E2+%3D+4k%5E2%2B+4k%2B+1%2B+4j%5E2%3D+4%28k%5E2%2Bk%2Bj%5E2%29%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the hypotenuse will be of the form
![4n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where ![n=1, 2,
3..](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3..&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
A similar relationship exists for
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples where every longest side
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is always of the form ![6n+1; n=1,2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%2B1%3B+n%3D1%2C2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is harder to demonstrate generally than for the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
example. But we can do it informally by breaking this down to multiple
cases. First, consider a coprime ![u,
v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2C+v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are successive odd and even numbers. We can write them as
![v=2k+1,
u=2k+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%3D2k%2B1%2C+u%3D2k%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then have ![c=u^2+uv+v^2=
6(2k^2+3k+1)+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3Du%5E2%2Buv%2Bv%5E2%3D+6%282k%5E2%2B3k%2B1%29%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is an integer of the form
![6n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Second, if we a consecutive odd coprime numbers, e.g. 1, 3 they will be
of the form ![u=2k+3,
v=2k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D2k%2B3%2C+v%3D2k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then ![c=6(2k^2 + 4k +
2)+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3D6%282k%5E2+%2B+4k+%2B+2%29%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is an integer of the form
![6n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, if we instead consider a coprime pair of the form ![u=2k+4,
v=2k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D2k%2B4%2C+v%3D2k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then ![c=u^2+uv+v^2= 3(4k^2 + 10k +
7)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3Du%5E2%2Buv%2Bv%5E2%3D+3%284k%5E2+%2B+10k+%2B+7%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This number will not be of the form
![6n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
but will be eliminated from the list because it is not a primitive
triple being divisible by 3. For example, as we saw above while applying
the correction factor for the counts, ![u=4,
v=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D4%2C+v%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![u=8,
v=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%3D8%2C+v%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are such eliminated pairs. By extending this argument we can see that
the only
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that remain will be of the form
![6n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
because the other coprime
![u,v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%2Cv&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pairs will generate non-primitive triples.

For the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples there is another interesting pattern: The most primitive triple
is ![3, 4,
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
At least 1 of the 3 sides of every subsequent primitive triple will be
divisible by 3, 4 and 5. For example: sorted by the hypotenuse
![c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the 29th triple ![T\_{90}^{29}= 57, 176,
185](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D%5E%7B29%7D%3D+57%2C+176%2C+185&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has the 1st side divisible by 3, the 2nd by 4 and the 3rd by 5. The 30th
triple ![T\_{90}^{30}= 104, 153,
185](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D%5E%7B30%7D%3D+104%2C+153%2C+185&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has the 1st side divisible by 4, the 2nd by 3, and the 3rd by 5. In
other cases, 2 of these might divide the same side: e.g. ![T\_{90}^{2}=
5, 12,
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D%5E%7B2%7D%3D+5%2C+12%2C+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where 5 divides the 1st side and 3, 4 divide the second. Sometimes all 3
numbers might divide the same side, e.g. ![T\_{90}^{9}= 11, 60,
61](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D%5E%7B9%7D%3D+11%2C+60%2C+61&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where the 2nd side is divisible by 3, 4, 5. A comparable relationship
exists for
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples: at least 1 of the 3 sides of the triple will be divided by at
least 2 of the following numbers: 3, 5, 7, 8. Of these 3, 5, and 8
divide at least 1 side of around
![\\tfrac{2}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples and 7 divides at least one side of around
![\\tfrac{3}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples.

Finally, in passing, one may also note that it has been known for a
while that the terms meru-średhi (known in the occident as the Fibonacci
sequence) can be used to generate particular
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples, though not all of them are primitive.  
Let ![f=1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D1%2C+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+8%2C+13...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the średhi, then a
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple is defined by:  
![x = f\[n\] \\cdot f\[n+3\]\\\\ y = 2f\[n+1\] \\cdot f\[n+2\]\\\\ z =
f\[2n+3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+f%5Bn%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bn%2B3%5D%5C%5C+y+%3D+2f%5Bn%2B1%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bn%2B2%5D%5C%5C+z+%3D+f%5B2n%2B3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
For example, if we take
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the
![T\_{90}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B90%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple: 105, 208, 233

Inspired this, we can derive a similar formula of the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triples (again all will not be primitive):  
![x = f\[n\] \\cdot f\[n+3\]\\\\ y= f\[j+1\] \\cdot f\[j+4\]\\\\ z=
f\[j\] \\cdot f\[j+2\]+f\[j+1\] \\cdot
f\[j+4\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+f%5Bn%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bn%2B3%5D%5C%5C+y%3D+f%5Bj%2B1%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bj%2B4%5D%5C%5C+z%3D+f%5Bj%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bj%2B2%5D%2Bf%5Bj%2B1%5D+%5Ccdot+f%5Bj%2B4%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
For example if we take
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the
![T\_{120}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B120%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triple: 105, 272, 337

A political bloviation follows: We must preface this by stating we do
not have any affiliation to the party currently ruling India or the RSS
and actually have no specific interest at all in electoral politics in
India or elsewhere. Further, we must emphasize that it is just an airing
of some thoughts and not a serious piece of writing. However, as a Hindu
we are concerned about Hindu interests. It is common, especially on
social media to whine *incessantly* over the failure of the pro-H ruling
party and its specific politicians. Of course many have said that it is
no pro-H party at all and have even extended this the RSS. Some days ago
someone even asked for definition of what H is in the first place — it
might be useful to evaluate such issues but that is not what we are
intending here. The bottom-line and realism are the most important
considerations here. Say an average individual wants to become a great
physicist or a mathematician, s/he cannot become one how much ever work
you put in: you need something innate. Likewise, a country cannot become
great just by wishing so or doing routine stuff — a lot depends on its
human capital combined to a degree with natural resources. Is human
capital unalterable? It is possible to improve it but it takes a lot of
effort over a long time — there are not shortcuts in temporal terms.
Time might not be a luxury at in ones hands, especially when you are
locked in an existential struggle with competitors and outright
genocidal enemies. In such a situation, you have to work with what you
have, and build a base on your strengths while constantly buying time
for the improvement.

In the past two months we have heard a couple of talks and read an
interview of the Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar which
precipitated some this. Further, we recently met with an official (not a
politician) of the bureaucratic arm Indian government who asked us
regarding a big plan they have. We sincerely reflected on the problem of
its implementation which again allowed us to zero in on an uncomfortable
issue. To start with Jaishankar, he makes some excellent points
regarding the geopolitical track record of the Indian state following
the departure of the English and its vivisection by the old enemies of
the H, the Mohammedans. He points out that the Indian geopolitical track
record has been mixed. On the positive side we have:  
1) As the first major nation that freed itself from the vice-like grasp
of Euro-Christian tyranny the Indian struggle inspired and set in motion
that transition in other parts of the world, however imperfect the
results might have been.  
2) The residual India managed to largely retain its integrity even
though the hostile Occident and the Mohammedans would have liked to chew
away more of it.  
3) India managed to inflict a crushing defeat on TSP, the inheritor of
the Mogol power in India, 1972 CE under the civilian leadership of
Indira Gandhi and break it up into two separate Islamic states.  
4) Developing an enduring relationship with a major power as fickle as
the Russians.  
5) The nuclear weapons tests in the 1990s and braving the subsequent
response from the hostile Occident.  
6) The fending off TSP’s ghazwat in Kargil.  
7) The successful conclusion of the Doklam standoff with the predatory
Cīna-s.

One the negative side we have the following:  
1) The inability to read the cīna-s and allowing the destruction of the
Tibetan nation by the rapacious Han.  
2) The humiliating defeat at the hands of the Han in 1962 CE.  
3) The inability to properly read TSP and handle the Rann of Kutch
fiasco without Leukospheric interference. This was followed by the
rather inept handling of the war of 1965 CE with India gaining a clear
upper hand against the TSP jihadis only in the later stages.  
4) The failure to develop nuclear weapons effectively following the
Smiling Buddha due to the flawed policies of the svamūtrapeyin.  
5) The failure to implement economic reform: it was one of the factors
causing India to lag behind the Cīna-s in a serious way. Here India
looked bad even with respect of the smaller Asian tigers.  
6) Serious failures in indigenous technology development and
industrialization relative to the competitors. The failure in this
sector went hand in hand with the poor negotiation of trade agreements
with other nations, with subsequent losses to industrial development.  
7) The general lack of clarity and realism on geopolitical issues and a
generally reactive and “lettings sort themselves” kind of attitude.

Most importantly, Jaishankar pointed out that whereas India might look
good when compared to its own past, it comes across quite poorly when
compared to competitors and other states which might have had similar
problems. For instance, if we looks at those states which are not direct
competitors: Japan suffered a humiliating defeat and occupation by the
Christian and Socialist (recall its surrender came due to being put
through Soviet Meat-grinder in Manchuria) powers in World War II.
However, it recovered remarkably, preserved its imperial Shinto
tradition against Christian imposition, and retaliated against the
Americans by damaging the American automobile industry (warfare through
other means). Then we have Korea. It suffered a vivisection like India
but South Korea has done impressively in economic and scientific terms.
Even Vietnam which had to suffer the brutality of two Christian powers
and division like India has reunified and is showing notable development
in various directions. As an example we may mention how they have
brought down India in the cashewnut business by development of
indigenous automation. In contrast, the communist government of the
state of Kerala has only placed impediments to Indian competitiveness in
effective cashewnut production. Our primary Asian competitor is China.
During the reign of Rajiv Gandhi it was at the same level of economic
and scientific development as India. Today it has conclusively left
India well behind. Thus, the Islamophilic Occident is unable to do much
when it steamrolls its conquered Mohammedan territories.

One issue in all this is human capital. It is something Indians have not
given much thought to. In many areas of modern technology and science
individuals are not fungible and there is no substitute for special
individuals both in terms of training and innate talent. Recently, there
has been much talk about how randomly chosen engineers from India fall
behind those from the Rus and China. Even in our college days it was
common for everyone to want to be an engineer; however, we could easily
see that most of them were hardly cut out for such. This trend has only
increased and the bulk-produced Indian engineer is as much an
embarrassment as the fake Indian scientist. This issue again came up in
the discussion with the Indian official. How much ever we tried to
emphasize it, it still felt like they are not getting the issue of need
for specially able and/or trained individuals to do big and complex
tasks. You cannot just throw money at mediocre graduates to do complex
jobs of the type the competitors like the Han are achieving. You need
first thing of people and their skills before the building and the
money. Many Indians talks about the failure of the education system.
Having gone through it, we can say that it is hardly something to feel
excited about; however, we think that it is not the most basic problem
confronting India. Rather the problem is one of high-end human capital
and its channelization.

While it is always a good thing to improve education, we have to be very
wary of importing models from the West, especially USA of today. First,
we know from direct observation (and the detailed report of a lady from
a BRICS country who is now a school teacher in the US) that the average
US school education is no better than what is there in India in terms of
the curriculum. In several ways it is organized more poorly — e.g. the
tempo and amount of science education in the average school (as opposed
to the special programs for highly competitive high IQ individuals). At
the college level the US simply resorts to setting up a fine filter such
that only the highest IQ passes through for most of the seats at a good
university. Of course, if high IQ individuals from other parts of the
world challenge the leukospheric dominance in certain schools they have
other subjective criteria in place to limit them. At the graduate level
this is even more acute such that the competitive professors who run
their labs like little empire builders get only the cream to join their
clashing forces. All of this is of course window-dressed to look nice
and fair. Thus, the primary function of the US university is not so much
to educate as to give a stamp of elite-membership to a high IQ
individual. But by far the most dangerous aspect of the American
universities is the culture of Social Justice (see below). Hence, India
cannot copy blindly in this regard and the government needs to be more
proactive in choosing the best individuals to think through and
formulate a program for educational reform. In the end we cannot escape
the fact that good teachers are the limiting factor with respect to
actually providing good education. We must remember that Hindus were
great knowledge-generators and teachers in the past. Hence, we need to
look at our models before blind copying.

This finally leads to a concept which we have been proposing for a while
— civilizational immunity — how immune is a civilization to bad
ideas/memes from other civilizations while being able internalize and
assimilate the good ones. To give a biological analogy: A cell wants to
take in foreign DNA via lateral transfer to gain selectively
advantageous genetic material. However, it needs to keep out deleterious
genetic material like viruses and plasmids and prevent them from gaining
a foothold in the cell. History tells us that the Indians generally have
a poor civilizational immunity and are especially susceptible to
dangerous memes from the Occident. In contrast, Japan has higher
civilizational immunity as seen in its resistance to Christian
imposition. It also seems that other East Asians like Vietnamese, Thai
and the Han also have higher levels than India. In addition to
Mohammedanism and the Jesus cult, today the most deleterious memes from
the West come in the form of the “Social Justice-Equality of outcome”
meme-complex. These diseases of the mind taking hold in India will have
a direct effect on the ability of the H to select and channel their
human capital. The effects could be seriously cripplingly if they take a
deep root as they could resonate with the already existing divides
coming from the wide gulfs between jāti-s. This complex of memes could
also cause social dysfunction by interfering with the productive
sexuality and introducing destructive tendencies to the sexually active
youth bulge of India and ruin any advantages that can be accrued from
it.

Problems with human capital show in even relatively simple things like
the svaccha-bhārata-abhiyānam: the intention is good and the sentiment
is in the right place. However, its implementation has lacunae because
of issues of human capital. It is hence important that in addition to
geopolitical realism in the realm of diplomacy and conflict, the Indian
leadership pay serious attention to selection of human capital, its
appropriate specialized training after selection, and its channelization
into national gains. This may have to go hand in hand with harsher laws
in certain directions. It has to also be somehow balanced with the gulfs
in returns between jāti-s — a very difficult thing given existing deep
problems compounded by Occidental fishing in troubled waters. The
government needs realism in this regard for the long term. What the long
term action entails and plans for how it may be executed cannot be
discussed on a public forum. Finally, one electoral defeat can set the
clock back, perhaps irretrievably. Indian electoral politics are highly
factional and asynchronous, thereby they place major road blocks to the
much needed development. This is something exploited by the enemies
while lulling the populace with “electoral entertainment”. Unlike the
Hindus, if the enemies are back in power due to the natural swings of
electoral politics, they will waste no time in destroying any remaining
scaffold that would allow H survival in the future. The Gandhi-Nehru
clique had earlier paid little attention to the fact that a sovereign
nation needs first and foremost a strong military to defend its
territory and interests. The results of this neglect were disastrous.
But their recent successors were even more pernicious in actually
batting for the enemy side. We already see the results of their
machinations in the judiciary, which has been seriously compromised and
infiltrated by the enemies of the H. Hence, we say whine as much as you
want about local issues, whose importance to H we do not deny; however,
keep the big picture and the long-term in mind. We do not have
alternatives in terms of the government and here a glass half full is
better than an empty one. Hence, rather than complaining all day on
social media the need of the day is to think of effectively pressuring
and/or working with the best one can get from electoral politics. In our
opinion all those local issues can be eventually won but the battle for
preventing death from civilizational immunodeficiency is the primary
one. If the immunity of an AIDS patient is restored he can fight all
those little diseases which would kill him without his immunity.

This is merely the tailpiece to the last tale of the strange hauntings.
A reader may wonder why expend so many words on a high school problem.
While the ball could have fitted into the socket, it rolled away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Jhilleeka was playing with her nephew upon Vidrum and Kalakausha’s
departure with the blue bottle she remarked to Somakhya: “Do you know I
had a peculiar little encounter with Hemling as a delayed aftermath to
his sliming by the kauṇapa?”  
S: “Lootika was once pretty angry and rough with him when we were in
college — he apparently came after you — does it relate to that? I must
say though that while Hemling had his quirks, I hardly think he was a
guy of harmful intent. He had genuine fascination for cracking
mathematical questions.”  
Jhilli: “Indeed. But I think he also had a strange competitive streak
though he likely meant no malice. At the face of it, it seemed he just
wanted to test me with an interesting problem as he remained in
disbelief for years that I solved the one he lobbed at our house in the
talent show.”  
Lootika: “May be he might have not intended anything inappropriate but
at that time I thought he was going out of the way to court Jhilli’s
attention and that’s what prompted my response.”  
Somakhya: “What exactly happened and what was the interesting
problem?”  
J: “It was some problem on a series sum or something — I have it
recorded in my collection of interesting results and will pull it out.
It happened when you all were in the university.”  
Lootika: “Yes, Hemling would sit in some common courses with us.”

J: “Varoli was in college too and it was the year when I used ride home
alone from school. One day while returning home from school I stopped my
bike to let a herd of milch-buffaloes rampaging like a procession of
Yamadūta-s to clear the road. As I was waiting, Hemling came up to me
suddenly out of nowhere and asked me whether I really solved his problem
by myself at the talent competition years ago. The suddenness with which
he came upon me startled me enough that I whipped out the pepper from my
bag and might have sprayed him had my reaction been quicker. But I
recognized that he was your classmate and former schoolmate Hemling. He
seemed scared but seeing me pause, he stated without any further
explanation that it would have been impossible for a girl that age to
have known calculus. I told him off saying something like what I know or
not know was none of his business. He continued unfazed saying that he
wanted to test me with a problem and if I solved it he would be ‘full of
admiration’ for me. I again told him off that I did not need his
admiration but would take his problem nevertheless.”  
Lootika: “No doubt he was mathematically gifted, but it was a bit too
much to just accost a much younger girl that way.”

Jhilleeka then dug out the problem from her collection: “Here it is! He
asked me this; given the polynomial equation,

![1+2x+3x^2+...nx^{n-1}=n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2%2B...nx%5E%7Bn-1%7D%3Dn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Show that one of its roots will always be real and rational. Provide a
closed expression for that root.

Somakhya took the problem from Jhilli and looked at it: “Indeed it
amounts to evaluation of a sum of a series with both geometric and
arithmetic features.”  
J: “I told him I could not solve it right away but will take it home and
work on it. He was bothered that I will ask Lootika for the answer and
cheat. A touch irritated I told him something like I was too conscious
of my own abilities to ask her. Anyhow, here is my solution that I
arrived at after spending sometime on it that evening.

We can evaluate the sum in the
![L.H.S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L.H.S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the given equation thus:

![\\displaystyle S=1+2x+3x^2...(n-1)x^{n-2}+nx^{n-1}\\\\\[10pt\] xS=
x+2x^2+3x^3...(n-1)x^{n-1}+nx^{n}\\\\\[10pt\]
xS-S=nx^{n}-1-x-x^2-x^3...-x^{n-1}\\\\\[10pt\]
S(x-1)=nx^{n}-\\sum\_{k=1}^{n}x^{k-1} = nx^n- \\dfrac{x^n-1}{x-1}=
\\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{x-1}\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore S=
\\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}=
\\dfrac{(nx-n-1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+S%3D1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2...%28n-1%29x%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2Bnx%5E%7Bn-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+xS%3D+x%2B2x%5E2%2B3x%5E3...%28n-1%29x%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2Bnx%5E%7Bn%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+xS-S%3Dnx%5E%7Bn%7D-1-x-x%5E2-x%5E3...-x%5E%7Bn-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+S%28x-1%29%3Dnx%5E%7Bn%7D-%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7Dx%5E%7Bk-1%7D+%3D+nx%5En-+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5En-1%7D%7Bx-1%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bnx%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D-nx%5En-x%5En%2B1%7D%7Bx-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+S%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bnx%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D-nx%5En-x%5En%2B1%7D%7B%28x-1%29%5E2%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%28nx-n-1%29x%5En%2B1%7D%7B%28x-1%29%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We see that,  
if ![n=2;
1+2x=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2%3B+1%2B2x%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
if ![n=3;

get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
if ![n=4;
1+2x+3x^2+4x^3=16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4%3B+1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2%2B4x%5E3%3D16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This tells us that the rational root might take the form
![1\\tfrac{1}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Substituting
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the sum
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we see that is indeed the case
![\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus,
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the only power of
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for which that sum will yield a polynomial equation from such a sum with
a rational root for every
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get the sum:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{k=1}^{n} k \\left(
1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^{k-1}=n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+k+%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7Bk-1%7D%3Dn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hemling asked agrajā the next day if I had asked her help for a math
problem and whether she had taught me calculus. Lootika did not know
what he was talking about but was primed that he was up to something.
Evidently, he wanted to catch me that evening and see if I had solved it
but I reached home before he could intercept me. It seems he trailed
Lootika and Vrishchika and figured out where we lived. He evidently hung
around for sometime and made the foolish mistake of asking them if I was
around when the two went out to play. Bristling like cats which have
fluffed up their fur for an attack my sisters yelled at Hemling
threatened him of deep trouble if he ever asked about me again. Being
only a gaṇitaśūra and otherwise quite a skittish guy, Hemling fled never
to come our way again.

Lootika: “While I think he really had no business tracking you that way,
your sister Vrishchika felt we had been too aggressive and apologized to
him.”  
J: But now comes the strange part. Just after you’ll left home Varoli
and I one day pried out a folded piece of paper that was inserted
between two stones in the compound wall of our house. On it was a
solution to the same problem in green ink. I suspect it was left there
by Hemling because it had solution using calculus — I sometimes wonder
if that’s how he believed it could be solved. Here is a picture of it:

![\\displaystyle S=1+2x+3x^2...(n-1)x^{n-2}+nx^{n-1} \\\\\[10pt\] \\int
Sdx = \\int \\left(1+2x+3x^2+...(n-1)x^{x-2}+nx^{n-1}\\right)
dx\\\\\[10pt\] =
x+x^2+x^3+x^{n-1}+x^n=\\dfrac{x^{n+1}+x}{x-1}\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore S=
\\dfrac{d}{dx} \\left( \\dfrac{x^{n+1}+x}{x-1} \\right) =
\\dfrac{(nx-n-1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}

Roots of the above polynomial equation

This story itself is haunted.

**The deaths**  
Seeing Vidrum intently gaze at something on his phone with an expression
of near disbelief Kalakausha asked: “Vidrum, what are you looking at? We
need to be leaving shortly. We have to buy some little gift for Somakhya
and Lootika’s daughter. I’ll be seeing her for the first time.”  
Vidrum: “It sort of relates to them.”  
Kalakausha: “Why, did they send some message?”  
V: “No. But Sphichmukh has apparently died today. His car was pummeled
by a truck.”  
K: “Oh! Who is this Sphichmukh?”  
V: “A rowdy from our school. He went on to become a well-known gangster
in these regions. In addition to running his regular crime syndicate he
also did a few hit-jobs under the payroll of the late
socialist-secularist leader Shonit.”  
K: “That’s interesting! Just last week we learnt that Shonit was
shot-down by his own friend Fakhr az-Zaman. As I told you, that Shonit
was a senior of mine in school and the son of the principal. He had
stalked and harassed me for sometime before something almost magical
happened. He always had his evil eye on my dear friend Lootika when she
was at our school. It was due to the danger from Shonit that she and her
sisters left my school and transferred to yours. Before that she said
Shonit will someday die a dreadful death and it has now come to pass!”

V: “Indeed; there is a parallel story on our side. This Sphichmukh was
an avowed enemy of Somakhya. He had stolen Somakhya’s stuff and had
stabbed Somakhya in his hand with a weapon he had made by hafting a
rusted nail to a wooden stock.”  
K: “Ouch! The coincident timing of the deaths of Sphichmukh from your
school and Shonit from ours who were respectively enemies of Somakhya
and Lootika really surprises me! Let me tell you something. I know
Lootika longer than you or her own husband Somakhya — while she conceals
it, she and her sisters are rumored to perform certain cremation ground
rituals to a dreadful goddess Chinnamastā that might confer some special
siddhi-s to them.”  
V: “Oh! That’s not news to me. That facet of Somakhya and Lootika is
well-known to me — surely they are practitioners of many other mantra-s
beyond Chinnamastā. Given my own experiences I think it is real. I don’t
know whether to believe it but I would not be surprised if Shonit and
Sphichmukh’s ends are a culmination of some abhicāra by them.”  
K: “On such a note let us get moving to their place. May be we might
experience something more of the mysteries at their place.”

°°°°°°

**The visit**  
Vidrum and Kalakausha arrived at their hosts’ house. Lootika and
Kalakausha hugged each other even as the visitors were ushered in.
Kalakausha also clashed palms with Jhilleeka who was also staying for a
few days at her sister’s place before her marriage. Jhilli was busy
assembling a drone with Somakhya and her nephew Tigmanika. Vidrum: “Ah!
times have changed. Now you guys are into making a drone and not balls
from rain-tree pods?” Tigmanika pointed to a corner in where there were
some of the famous balls saying: “No. I did make a few successfully and
they are drying now”. V: “So the tradition is not dead after all.”
Somakhya: “It may be low tech but as you know it is a character-building
experience.” Jhilli: “Making this gooey paste is at least safer than
Varoli and Mitrayu’s project of harvesting the resins of the secret
manchineel trees an Englishman is said to have introduced to our region
in the days of their tyranny.” Vidrum: “You may think this is safe but
Somakhya could tell you of the time when his finger was smashed because
Lootika distracted him in this activity”. S: “Talk of pain and pleasure
being the two sides of the same coin: the touch of dear Lootika and the
pain of a bust finger.” Lootika instinctively sidled up to Somakhya and
caressed that finger of his even though the incident was from 18 years
ago.

In the meantime Lootika was showing Kalakausha their one year old
daughter Prithika who was asleep on a mat under a painting of Śakha,
Viśakha, Nejameṣa, Skanda and Ṣaṣṭhī. K: “So the gods have been good to
you; you have furthered your genes twice and continued the lineage of
arthropodous names among the females of your clan.” L: “Praise be to
Ṣaṣṭhī, she has survived fine so far but there still a while to go and
hope the Kumāra-graha-s remain pacified.” K: “And I hope she has not
regressed to the mean as you were fearing.” L: “Well, I think assessing
this at age one is a little tricky. However, you will notice that beside
her she has arranged those play discs in the form of different symmetric
polygons with increasing number of sides all by herself. She is also
fascinated by making triangles and joining them to make polygons. That’s
not a bad sign.” K: “It struck me that she resembles your sister Jhilli
the most and perhaps will show her inclinations too. Vidrum told me of
how she solved an interesting mathematical problem even at school.” L:
“As for her appearance, yes, but it is too early to say anything more.”
K: “And what about your research?’ L: “What to say? At some time one has
to come to terms with the more complete experience of life and that one
is a mere mortal. Though, I should say I’m not done with the my
discoveries yet.”

After lunch, which had mostly been cooked by Jhilleeka, they were
enjoying a pāyasa made solely by Lootika. Vidrum: “It is good that you
V1s still cook their own food. It feels soothing to the tongue.”
Kalakausha: “I very much wanted to get some stuff along but Lootika had
strictly forbidden me. I guess it is a ritual day for you all.”
Somakhya: “Yes we completed the new moon ritual before you came.”
Lootika: “Now that you all are done with dessert, would you guys want to
come up to our home lab and take a look at the remarkable
Xenophyophorean amoeba shell that we obtained from an acquaintance?”

K: “Sure dear, but we would really like to see something else too if you
might accede.” Vidrum and Kalakausha could not immediately make sense of
the great excitement of their hosts at the wavy shell of the amoeba they
had obtained, even as Somakhya and Jhilleeka were lost in commenting on
its interesting geometry. Kalakausha brought them back to her
intentions: “Do you guys still keep all those ghosts you all had
captured over the years? Could you show us those containers? Also did
you not promise to give me one of them.” Somakhya: “Do really want to
see them. May be Vidrum is not at all keen to be reminded of them or
have any back.” K: “It almost seems Vidrum these days seem to miss some
of his past friends.” V: “While I don’t miss the times, the excitement
of those encounters cannot be understated. Moreover, these friends of
ours tell me that they might not have yet left me for good…”

°°°°°°

**The eidolon chest**  
At the insistence of their guests Somakhya and Lootika led them to the
sacristy attached their fire-room. Before entering the chamber Somakhya
said: “Repeat the following incantation after me in a low voice 10
times: “OṂ GAṂ GLĀṂ VĪRA-VINĀYAKĀYA SARVAVETĀLA-RODHAKĀYA
BHUTAGAṆĀDHIPATYE HUṂ PHAṆ NAMAḤ \|\|” Then Lootika passed them a box
with gray ash in it and asked them to smear some on their foreheads.
Thereafter the two led their guests into the chamber where they beheld a
large iron chest with the images of four elephant-headed Vināyaka-s
craved on it. Lootika place a small ball of rice in a bowl before the
box and Somakhya uttered the incantation “ye bhūtāḥ pracaranti…” Jhilli,
who was standing at the entrance said: “For a while I was the primary
keeper of these phantoms as my siblings left to complete their degrees.
Then when I was to leave I handed it over back to Somakhya and Lootika.
Now they have been partitioned to Vrishchika and Indrasena, Varoli and
Mitrayu and in few days when Prachetas comes to pick me we will take our
set to our own house. So what are here are those of ours and Somakhya
and Lootika who still remain the most prolific in their catch.”

V: “Ah! so the collection has been mostly partitioned. But I am sure
there will be some memorable ones.” Lootika opened the box and pointed
to a cast iron pot: “Certainly. Here, you can see the famous Englishman
who haunted your regions and came to us via your gifts just before you
disposed your childhood home.” Then she raised a green bottle and
remarked: “Here is another Englishman whom we in jest named Thomas
Crapper as he had a proclivity for stuffing the clothes of a jaina girl,
who lived in the hostel beside your house, into the commode.” Somakhya
pointed to a pill-bottle: “This one is your friend Chineri Chetana — the
one who bothered you while watching a ghost movie.” V: “Ah. Good
riddance, I certainly don’t want him back.” Somakhya then showed him a
stone: “And this one is a khārkhoḍa.”

K: “But what about the your very first capture Lootika? Was that not the
adventure where I accompanied you and then you had that ghost help me
against Shonit?” L: “That one is here in this blue bottle and is the one
I will be handing over to you again. Actually that story begins even
before you were involved and went on for a while after that brush with
Shonit, whom the gods have taken care of.” V: “I really need to hear
that story. It seems to be from a time before we moved into our infamous
house and may give me some clues of the phantoms that existed before my
time there.” K: “Lootika, you need to start the story for the beginning
is something only you know.” L: “Let us get back to the hall and I’ll
tell you that part there. It is not wise to linger around with the chest
open for long. There are some like the Englishman who are very
dangerous.”

°°°°°°

**The capture**  
Back in the hall Lootika narrated her tale: “All of us here know the lay
of that place but please indulge me while I bring it back to your mind
after all these years for it might make some points clearer. As you know
there were 4 individual houses with some separation between them at
beginning of the Bhaktamarga. We lived in the second of those. The road
then turned left and ran some distance south. On that stretch there were
a string of apartment complexes on the right side. Along the left side
there was a small park, the municipal telecommunications office and a
guesthouse of the association of the Lāṭa-s.”  
V: “Let me interject here. You may not know that, but we used to live in
a flat in the 2nd of those apartment complexes you mention. Lootika, I
had seen you a few times wandering around on your bike along the road
but I’m not sure if you recall.”

Lootika continued: “My parents tell me that I was a precocious rider and
may be I had some vague recollection that you belonged to our regions
when I first encountered you in the new school. But to move on, the road
continued for some distance with several shops and eateries and then
turned right and ended at the gate of the ground used by the policemen
for their recreation. Actually it continued as a unpaved path along the
high wall of the police ground and curved around along the wall of the
notorious cemetery of our youth through a very desolate stretch, which
none frequented, until it led to the bus stop. All of you would recall
that bus stop where we often caught a bus in our youth. Just before the
police ground, separated from it by about 15 meters was the sprawling
house of a rich family. I believe they were physicians and were
apparently known to my parents in passing. I have a vague recollection
of biking around with the girl of that family who was a little older
than me. One day a brother of that girl died and shortly thereafter they
left the place. They never told us or my parents anything — they just
seem to have vanished one day.”  
V: “Yes, I have a clear recollection of that girl and her brother too.
Unlike you in those days, they were very friendly and talked to me quite
a bit. I too was mystified by their sudden disappearance.”

L: “Their house was evidently bought by a jaina developer. One day when
my sisters and I accompanied our mother to get some groceries from the
shop near that house we found that a ritual was being performed. My
mother heard the incantations briefly and told me that they were doing a
jaina bhairava ritual, likely because they feared something related to
the boy’s mysterious death. Whatever the case, that house had remained
unoccupied for an year since that point. Now I must switch to a
different thread of the tale. Beyond the bus stop at the distance of
about a kilometer was a rākṣasālaya which had a truly dreadful look to
it, built atop an old temple, with the howls of the maru-rākṣasārādhana
sending shivers down ones spine. There during one of their celebrations
they brought a camel and slit its throat on the street beside the said
disputable structure. It was then that a youth with a proclivity for
extreme violence was arrested for the act — I think Jihad al Faqih was
his name. But being both a juvenile and a person from the religion of
peace he was promptly released. He went on to commit several other grim
atrocities through out the locality, much like a budding field marshal
Idi Amin Dada. For instance, he would tie crackers to the tails of dogs.
He pushed a latrine pig and a dog with a long pole into the traffic on
the main road on the way to our school causing them to be run-over
leaving a bloody mess on the street. These are some frightful memories
and they still touch me with a tinge of fear. One day he killed a cow by
feeding it a lit explosive. This was the tipping point. The local
members of the Seva-dal captured him and handed him over to the police.
But the wimpish cops, who brandished their danḍa-s only at Hindus,
fearing his host of unruly bearded friends again released him pretty
soon.”  
V: “I recall the brutality of this evil youth but then did he not die
suddenly?”

L: “Yes. That’s where the story rejoins the old thread. Soon after Jihad
al Faqih was out of custody, he was suddenly found dead just outside
that unoccupied house sprawled outside the gate with his belly
apparently ripped open and entrails spilling out.”  
Somakhya: “I recall that suddenly he had a swarm of defenders led by a
secular woman claiming that he was lynched by Hindu terrorists, even as
her fellow banshees ululated to no end like the mourners at the grave of
the of the gigantic Mohammedan terrorist of yore, Afzal Khan.”  
Kalakausha: “That woman is none other Anudhupita Das who even made a
movie, where a character evidently based on Jihad al Faqih was shown as
the victim. However, nobody in the outside world really knew how he
died.”

L: “Ah. Indeed, that whole noise, in a perverse way, distracted people
from a real investigation of this unmatta’s death. It was around that
time my parents introduced me to the basics of the
Uḍḍāmareśvara-tantram. After the basic siddhānta-śravaṇam censoring
certain parts, they initiated me into the triad of mantra-s known as
Bhūtādhipati Virūpākṣa, Vajra Caṇḍeśvara and the famed Nṛsiṃhaceṭaka. I
intensely practiced those for some time and soon felt I possessed their
mantra-vīrya. However, in truth my siddhi was only partial. But it was
enough to open this mystery world to me. Kalakausha, this is when you
enter the story — why don’t you continue. I’ll attend to my daughter and
be back.”

Kalakausha: “One day after school I decided to visit Lootika’s regions
because she had told me of a haunted house where we could see ghosts.
Lootika had a bike but I did not have one so I sat on the carrier and
she stood the pedals to bear our combined weight and we went together to
that house outside which al Faqih was found dead. It may have been about
6 months after that incident. I distinctly recall that it was a summer
afternoon with the sun still quite high up. From the inception it was
clear that house was strange. It stood midst a large, unkempt lawn and
was absolutely deserted. Lootika chained her bike to a tree and we
surreptitiously sneaked into the house via a hole in the hedge. The door
was open and we had no difficult getting in. Lootika removed her shoes
and placed two soles inside them, on which she had drawn some
frightening looking figures. She said they were vetāla-pādukā-s. She
kept muttering some incantations from time to time. The house was stark
empty but for a large mirror in one of the rooms we entered. I looked at
the mirror and behind me I saw Lootika. But behind her I saw a strange
tall man with the tripuṇḍra marks smeared on him. Utterly terrified I
was about to scream but it was almost as if Lootika divined it and leapt
forward and covered my mouth. She muttered something like men are more
dangerous than ghosts in my ear. I asked her if she has seen him. Just
then the door creaked and started to slowly close. Then it drew back and
slammed shut. We were now in this room with the door shut and it seemed
much darker. Every second seemed like hour to me. Petrified, at loss for
words and with my eyes blurred by tears, I pointed to at the shut door
to Lootika. Somakhya, I still feel the terror of every second but your
wife, while she was then still a kid, seemed quite at ease. Holding my
hand she sat down on the floor uttered some incantation. To my utter
surprise the window now swung open by itself and through the corner of
my eye I caught sight of that man with the tripuṇḍra marks again. He
seemed to be singing something in a Dravidian language — I’m pretty sure
it was the Karṇāṭa tongue. Lootika stopped her incantation and he seemed
to go quiet and the door to that room opened again. I told Lootika that
we must leave immediately. She calmly walked out of the room and opened
a pill-bottle uttered some incantation again and shut it close.”

J: “I think in reality agrajā is way more scared than me in these
ghostly matters.”  
V: “Jhilleeka, would you tell that to your sister’s face? In any case, I
guess this was not the phantom of the monstrous Jihad al Faqih ?”  
K: “No, in a bhūtavāda which Lootika performed after capturing it in the
said pill-box, this bhūta said that it was a liṅgavant and that it had
killed al Faqih for trespassing his liṅgālaya. Much to my fright, she
then took me back on her bike to the deserted house before dropping me
off at the bus stop and showed me a desecrated liṅgālaya in its
backyard. Evidently the bhūta had rested there before al Faqih, in the
manner characteristic of marūnmatta-s, had vandalized. He apparently
paid for his deed right away.”  
S: “That’s why this bhūta was dangerous but potentially useful.”

°°°°°°

**The aid**  
Kalakausha: “That’s indeed true Somakhya! Let me tell you’ll rest of the
story as it pertained to me. From the night of visiting that deserted
house things started going downhill for me.”  
V: “Now you can understand what my youth was like. Continue… for it
seems I’m the only one not in the know regarding this back story of my
former dwelling.”  
K: “I would have a nightmare or two every night from then on. My sleep
was disturbed and my nose would constantly get stuffy at night. By the
end of that semester I was truly a mess. My mother would be bawling at
me for not getting up on time or falling asleep during homework time. As
Lootika could tell you, I was always a decent student but I barely
passed that semester as I had lost all interest in studies. My mother
suggested that they send me off our village to be a farmhand. My best
friend Lootika left the school and, bereft of my usual company, I was
slipping into this utterly shambolic state. It was then that I visited
Lootika one evening — she was already in your school then — I placed my
predicament before her. She taught me a mantra of the tricephalic
Dattātreya that I practice to this date and asked me to do a japa of it
for 20000 times or more. She also gave me that bottle in which she had
deposited the ghost we just talked about and said it would be of use to
me in the near future.”  
Jhilleeka: “Vidrum, I believe it was then that the jaina demolished that
sprawling house and sold part of the land to your father to build your
new house and he built a hostel for the jaina-s in the rest of the land
— the one next to your former house.”  
V: “I cannot forget how excited I was that we were getting our own
separate house but soon thereafter things went crazy for me.”  
K: “But for me things looked up for the first time in 8 months at that
point. My parents were almost ready to withdraw me from school and send
me to the village when I completed the said count of 20000 of the
mantra. It was almost as if the monsoons had ended! The nightmares
vanished, I was doing spectacularly at school and even my skin suddenly
became smooth and shiny and my hair thicker living up to my name. But
this came with the undesired attention of that lout Shonit. One day he
had one of his wingmen to ride his bike over my foot. It split my toe
and I was bleeding and in great pain. I sat down on the footpath to take
off my shoe. Just then Shonit appeared and started touching me
inappropriately claiming he wanted take me to the doctor. I realized his
evil intent and asked him to give me second. As he eagerly stood by, I
drew out the bottle with the phantom and uncorked it as Lootika had
instructed. What happened next was sheer magic. Shonit simply ran away!
He never came near me for the remaining years I was in that school. But
I believe the ghost had escaped for good.”

°°°°°°

**The phantom returns**  
Lootika returned after attending to her kid bringing her along with her
toys to play beside them. Lootika: “But the story does not end there was
one more chapter before the specter ended in the blue bottle I’m going
to hand over to you.”  
Somakhya: “We resume our story with Vidrum in his now famous new house
with no clue on what land it or its predecessor had built upon. He used
to tell me these curious tales of poltergeists, aural phenomena and
apparitions. I believed none of it but was immensely entertained by his
tales. Things then precipitated. Now, a detour just to keep you in the
loop Kalakausha, in case you were not aware. Our school had a system of
dividing the students into 4 teams — perhaps a hangover from the days of
the tyrannical English rule. Each team had a teacher as its guide.
Vidrum, Sharvamanyu and I were always in the same team from class 1 and
by some lucky synchronicity Lootika and her sisters also came into our
team when she joined the school. These teams competed against each other
in sports and other school activities like quizzes and debates. After
the mid-semester exam we had the sports events which sort of let us cool
off a bit from the evil of the exams. After the first semester-end exams
we had various competitions which were called ‘talent competitions’.
That year somehow the history teacher, who was the guide of our team,
duly drafted me to put together the team for debating the rival team. Of
course I dragged by friends Vidrum and Sharva much to their horror to be
my partners in this debate.”

Lootika: “Ah, those wasteful days! I remember for the girls the topic
was ‘What will I do if I became the prime minister’ and as luck would
have it I too was drafted by the teacher for this affair.”  
Vidrum: “I think for boys it was something like ‘Akbar was India’s
greatest ruler’. Lootika, it was but natural you were drafted. After all
in every class you used to volunteer first to answer whatever question
the teachers would pose. As the math-crazed Hemling would say: ‘This
girl has the gall to even raise her hand in the math class.’ ”  
Kalakausha: “She was like that even in the old school but I think she
was really better than us even then.”  
Vidrum: “Of course, on that occasion it was I believe it was little
Jhilleeka who challenged the assholish Hemling and his math and probably
triggered our ghost’s mischief.”  
Kalakausha: “OK. Why don’t one of you now get back to telling the story
straight.”  
Vidrum: “Somakhya why don’t you continue, since only you may recall some
of the intricacies?”

S: “Perhaps, I should have not gotten so deep into the ādiparvan of that
story — let me try to keep it going though. Sharva and I were rehearsing
with Vidrum for the impending event in his house. We had planned that
Vidrum will give the opening speech of our team on the downsides of the
skull-pilling Mogol tyrant and I was coaching him for that. Each time he
would get up to formally rehearse his speech something strange would
happen and disrupt it. First the door of his room opened and slammed
shut loudly. I thought it was the wind. Then we heard a strange noise of
running water. I asked Vidrum to check if there was a leak somewhere but
he nonchalantly told me it was the ghost but forgot his speech when he
tried to continue. Next, Sharva kept exclaiming that some one was
hitting him from behind — I thought he was just playing a prank and
asked him to be serious as we had get our act together.

Then somebody knocked on the door. Vidrum was a bit surprised — his
parents and aunt had their own keys and were not supposed to return at
that hour. Wondering if they had come early and forgotten to take their
key he went to check the door. He came back and said it must be the
ghost because no one was there. We went with him to check things out
when we hear that knock for the second time. Vidrum’s family had let a
loitering cur get comfortable in the yard of their home. That dog was
looking at one side of the yard and barking. Hence, we wondered if
someone had come into the compound. There were reports in the local news
that choṭā Shaikh, a notorious thief was on the prowl robbing people at
knife-point. Hence, Vidrum suggested that we arm ourselves before
looking for a potential intruder. He took a billhook saying the he could
deal with choṭā Shaikh even as his grandfather had put down ghāzi baḍā
Mastan with one such when he was on a ghazvat on behalf of the Amirs of
Gavalakuṇḍa. He gave us each a staff. We went around the house and saw
no one at all. The cur was now barking at the house door. Fearing that
the intruder could have entered the house I suggested that we search the
house with one standing a the door and the remaining two checking the
house. Vidrum did not seem too bothered, being convinced it was the
ghost. I was reminded of my grandfather’s tale of how his horse saw a
ghost which he had failed to see. Just then I caught sight of a muddy
footprint below the doorstead and remarked that indeed somebody is
around, given that there was a puddle from the water accumulated in one
part of Vidrum’s yard. But Sharva pointed out that it was a single
footprint with no others insider or outside the house. Vidrum exclaimed
that is was proof enough that we are facing a ghost and Sharva
concurred. I was not sure but we went back to Vidrum’s room after
locking the door. There to my utter surprise I saw geometric diagram in
multicolored ink on the pad of paper I had left on the ground to note
comments as Vidrum rehearsed.

![Golden_ratio_square_triangle_semicircle](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/golden_ratio_square_triangle_semicircle.png)Figure
1: The geometric diagram on Somakhya’s pad

The pen with multiple colors was however on Vidrum’s desk. This seemed
serious and I suggested to the two that I perform a bhūtoddhāra by using
a certain mantra. I duly captured the bhūta in a Japanese paper
water-bomb. The next day I got to meet Lootika for sometime at the class
for the art exam. I told her of this incident and she filled me in on
the house and mentioned that the ghost may be a genius of locus that she
had captured earlier. At that point neither of us knew that the general
premise of her surmise was wildly wrong; but by some coincidence she was
correct with regard to this phantom. It was indeed the one she had
captured and given Kalakausha earlier. I gave the water-bomb to her
saying it was best that she keep it as she had captured it first and we
exchanged notes on the uddhāra-prakriyā. I had used the
Indra-bīja-pratyaṅgirā-mantra of the Ḍāmarā-pratyāṅgirā tradition.”

°°°°°°

**The endgame**  
Somakhya: “I’ve spoken enough. Most of us know this story in some form
anyhow. But for Kalakausha’s benefit why don’t you complete it Jhilli,
for you were sort of the heroine of the day.”  
Jhilli: “Or if our rivals would have had their way I was the villainess.
In any case I’ll only tell the final part which I actually remember. I
think the debates were equivocal due to match-fixing by the teachers of
the different houses and the atmosphere of secularism that permeates the
educated, well-healed Hindu class which attends schools such as ours. I
think the guys did a good job arguing that Akbar despite his later
apostasy did little to merit him the title of the greatest ruler of
India. My dear sister was however castigated for stating that as a prime
minister she would treat certain religions and their secular mutations
as mental diseases, which they undoubtedly are.

Then, the irascible math teacher who governed Hemling’s house, our
rivals, said (perhaps instigated by none other than Hemling) that the
talent contests would end with each house asking the other a supposedly
hard math question. Very generously, they asked our house to go first
and we elected Somakhya to pose a question on our behalf. He gave the
following problem:

![3circles_in_circle](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/3circles_in_circle.png)

Figure 2. Somakhya’s problem

Given a circle, it is divided into a semicircle on top and two quadrants
below. A half-square triangle, with its diagonal as the diameter, is
inscribed in the semicircle . What is the relationship of the radii of
the incircle of the half-square triangle and the incircles of quadrants?
What is the ratio of the base to the congruent sides of the isosceles
triangle formed by the centers of the three incircles?

After some effort Hemling countered Somakhya’s astra. The math teacher
then stepped in and declared that Somakhya actually asked 2 questions;
hence, Hemling could ask 2 of his own successively. He also pointed out
that Somakhya could at best respond to one of them for each participant
could be involved only in a fixed number items and Somakhya had all but
exhausted his available total in the Akbar affair. Hemling posed the
following question: Given ![a = 100; k=3; m=3;
x_0=13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+100%3B+k%3D3%3B+m%3D3%3B+x_0%3D13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
what will be the attractor of
![x\_{n+1}=\\left(ax_n^k\\right)^{1/2^m}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cleft%28ax_n%5Ek%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F2%5Em%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
He placed the condition that only a log table may be used.

Somakhya pointed out that if
![k=2^m-r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2%5Em-r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![m=\\lceil \\log_2(r)
\\rceil](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Clceil+%5Clog_2%28r%29+%5Crceil&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
then ![n \\to \\infty, \\;
x\_{n}=\\sqrt\[r\]{a}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%2C+%5C%3B+x_%7Bn%7D%3D%5Csqrt%5Br%5D%7Ba%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the attractor would be ![\\sqrt\[5\]{100} \\approx
2.51188](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%5B5%5D%7B100%7D+%5Capprox+2.51188&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

With a grotesque smile Hemling then asked his second question, a
geometric problem, almost as though to mock us. It went thus:

![square_inscribed_triangle](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/square_inscribed_triangle.png)

Figure 3. Hemling’s problem

Given a square inscribed in an isosceles triangle, with one side lying
along the base of the said triangle, at what base angle
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will the ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the
isosceles triangle be maximum.

Just a few days before those ‘talent competitions’ my family and
Somakhya’s had visited our local temple for a ritual. During a long wait
there Somakhya’s father had been humoring me with various geometric
relationships that could be derived using origami. As a result an idea
flashed in my mind and I was able to answer Hemling’s challenge using an

With that Hemling’s astra had been blunted and I believe our house had
won by aggregate points. But many people who are good at mathematics
from birth also have other mental quirks. Vidrum and Kalakausha you may
know something about this. Hemling could not brook being blunted thus.
He threw a tantrum like a kid from a class lower than me and claimed
that I, of a class where kids were still learning their multiplication
tables, could not possibly answer this problem which needed calculus.
Hence, I had to have cheated — he made the bizarre assertion that
Somakhya or Lootika had passed me a chit with the solution. Lootika was
seated beside me and had passed me the water-bomb with the ceṭaka. The
math teacher siding with Hemling believed that it was the chit she had
given me and roughly plucked the water-bomb from my hand and crumpled it
in an attempt to unfold it.

The next moment hell literally broke loose. The large light on the
ceiling of our school hall came loose fell to the ground with a crash
spewing dust and shards of glass. Next a fan detached itself and dropped
with an equally loud crash and the ceiling was sparking eerily from the
shorted circuits. Then Hemling yelled that a great blob shaped like the
solid of rotation of a hippopede was rushing at him. Soon he was bathed
in a strange slime. The teachers aghast at this dismissed the show
immediately and asked us to return to our classes take our things and go
home.”

Somakhya: “I was quite intrigued by the fact that Hemling’s second
problem had an intimate connection to the problem presented by the bhūta
on my pad in Vidrum’s house. Vidrum, you may recall the effort you put
into it. Given the square ![\\square

Lootika: “That was fun. To conclude, that weekend after the class for
the art exam, Somakhya and I slipped into the hall and recaptured our
ceṭaka in a blue bottle. We also recovered the crumpled water-bomb on
which were written the words:  
apaśyaṃ mṛtaṃ guñjabhramaraṃ pathe’smin । śāradi guñjabhramarāṇāṃ

That’s when it may come handy.”

Consider a fixed semicircle with center at
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and radius
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Let ![\\triangle
ABC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the isosceles triangle which circumscribes it (Figure 1).

[![triangle_circumscribing_semicircle](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle.png)Figure

What will be the characteristics of the minimal form of the said
triangle, i.e. triangle with minimum perimeter, which will circumscribe
the said semicircle? Let the base angles of the isosceles triangle be
![\\angle
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In order to determine the equation for the perimeter with respect to
this base angle this we perform the following construction (Figure 2):  
1) Join point
![O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to one of the points of tangency of the circumscribing triangle ABC and
the semi-circle (Point ![I_1,
I_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_1%2C+I_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).  
2) This gives us two right triangles ![\\triangle
OI_2C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+OI_2C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![\\triangle
AI_2O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+AI_2O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) Using their sides and ![\\angle
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can determine the lengths of the segments ![\\overline{OC},
\\overline{I_2C},
\\overline{I_2A}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOC%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BI_2C%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BI_2A%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2). Twice their sum will yield the equation of the perimeter of
the triangle. It is:

![P=2r\\left (\\tan(x)+
\\dfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\dfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D2r%5Cleft+%28%5Ctan%28x%29%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctan%28x%29%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we will get the minimal triangle when the function ![y=\\left
(\\tan(x)+
\\tfrac{1}{\\tan(x)}+\\tfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cleft+%28%5Ctan%28x%29%2B+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctan%28x%29%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
attains a minimum (Figure 3).

![semicircle_triangle_minim](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/semicircle_triangle_minim.png)Figure

The derivative of this function is (Figure 3):  
![y'=\\left (\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}-
\\dfrac{1}{\\sin^2(x)}-\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D%5Cleft+%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ccos%5E2%28x%29%7D-+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28x%29%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ccos%28x%29%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28x%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We get our minimum when
![y'=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus at minimum,

![\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sin^2(x)}+\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)}\\\\\[7pt\]
\\sin^2(x)=\\cos^3(x)+\\cos^2(x)\\\\\[7pt\]

Putting
![y=\\cos(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ccos%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the cubic equation
![y^3+2y-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E3%2B2y-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It can be factorized as ![(y + 1) (y^2 + y - 1) =
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y+%2B+1%29+%28y%5E2+%2B+y+-+1%29+%3D+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From which we get the roots as ![(-\\phi, -1,
\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-%5Cphi%2C+-1%2C+%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![\\phi=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the Golden ratio and
![\\phi'=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1%7D%7B2%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
![x=\\arccos(y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Carccos%28y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the base angle of an isosceles triangle,
![y=\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the only valid value for which the
![\\arccos(y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%28y%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
may be taken. Thus we get,

![x=\\arccos(\\phi') \\approx
0.9045569](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Carccos%28%5Cphi%27%29+%5Capprox+0.9045569&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, when the base angles of the isosceles ![\\triangle
ABC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are
![\\arccos(\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carccos%28%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then we have the minimal circumscribing triangle of a given semicircle
(Figure 4).

![triangle_circumscribing_semicircle_shrI](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/triangle_circumscribing_semicircle_shri.png)Figure
4

The special features of this triangle can be seen in Figure 4, where the
radius of the fixed semicircle is taken to be a unit: It is made up 2
right triangles whose sides specify the equation of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![\\phi^2-\\phi-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%5E2-%5Cphi-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The various powers of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are captured by it. The perimeter of the minimal circumscribing triangle
is thus ![2r
\\phi^{5/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2r+%5Cphi%5E%7B5%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The 2 points where the triangle touches the circular arc of the
semicircle are specified by the angle
![\\arcsin(\\phi')](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28%5Cphi%27%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

This triangle has a special place in the great geometric manifestation
of the Bhairava and the Bhairavī, known as the Śrī-yantra, versions of
which are worshiped in the Paścimāṃnāya (Kubjikā; Western lodge) and
Dakṣiṇāṃnāya (Śrī-kula; Southern lodge) of the kaula tradition. This
yantra is described in a key text of these traditions, the
Saundaryalaharī, thusly:  
caturbhiḥ śrīkaṇṭhaiḥ śivayuvatibhiḥ pañcabhir api  
prabhinnābhiḥ śaṃbhor navabhir api mūlaprakṛtibhiḥ ।  
tryaś-catvāriṃśad vasu-dala-kalāśra-trivalaya  
tri-rekhābhiḥ sārdhaṃ tava śaraṇa-koṇāḥ pariṇatāḥ ॥

![shrI_yantra](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shri_yantra.png)Figure
5

The above verse from the Saundaryalaharī may be rendered as:  
The (tri)angles in what constitute your dwelling, which is built of 9
mūla-prakṛti-s, i.e. the 4 Śrīkaṇṭha-s and the 5 Śiva-yuvati-s, all
\[stationed\] apart from Śambhu, along with the lotuses with Vasu- (8)
and lunar-digit- (16) petals, the 3 circles and the 3 lines, are 43 in
number. (modified version of the translation of Subrahmanya Shastri and
Shrinivasa Ayyangar)

This verse precisely captures the essence of the structure of the
Śrī-yantra. The 9 mūla-prakṛti-s are the 9 basic triangles that
constitute to the yantra. They represent the 9-fold form of the Bhairava
of the Paścimāṃnāya, namely Navātman-bhairava. They are in turn divided
into: 4 upward-facing or liṅga triangles, which are termed Śrīkaṇṭha-s.
These are the manifest forms of the Bhairava. 5 downward-facing or yoni
triangles, which are termed Śiva-yuvati-s. These are the manifest forms
the Bhairavī. The central point, the bindu, lies apart from from them
and represents the Bhairava in his state as the unmanifest singularity,
i.e. Akulavīra. In contrast, the rest of the yantra with is manifold
geometric structures can be seen as his śakti, Kaulinī, who manifests
diversely as the kula-s of Yoginī-s. These Yoginī-s inhabit all elements
of the structure: For example, the 8 mātṛkā-s (Caṇḍikā, Brāhmī, Rudrāṇī,
Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā) inhabit the 8-petalled
lotus (This is as per the mūla-prakrīyā of the Ānanda-bhairava
tradition. Other paramparā-s place the Kāma-yoginī-s from Anaṅgapuṣpā to
Anaṅgamālinī in these petals). The 16 Śrī-nityā-s inhabit the
16-petalled lotus.

The 43 triangles are reckoned as the 42 outward-pointing triangles and
the inner-most triangle formed by the intersection of the 9 basic
triangles. The outermost of these has 14 triangles known as the
Saubhāgyadāyaka in which dwell the Sarva-saubhāgyadāyaka-yoginī-s. The
second rung with 10 triangles is known as the Sarvārthasādhaka with
eponymous yoginī-s. The third rung again with 10 triangles is the
Sarva-rakṣākara with the 10 yoginī-s of that kula. The 4th rung with 8
triangles is the Sarva-rogahara with the 8 Vāgdevī-s as its resident
yoginī-s. The 5th rung with the central triangle around the bindu has
Kāmeśvarī as its yoginī.

So, where does our above minimal triangle figure in all this? It defines
the Śrīkanṭha-1 which is the first triangle to be drawn while
constructing the Śrī-yantra. Also, notably, the first Śiva-yuvati is an
isosceles triangle formed by welding two 3-4-5 right triangles along the
side of length 4. As we have seen before, this 3-4-5 triangle, the most
primitive of the integral right triangles, emerges naturally as the
maximal triangle defined by [the characteristic ellipse of a right
triangle](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/07/18/discovering-bronze-in-the-characteristic-ellipse-of-right-triangles/).
Thus, the two primary triangles of the Śrī-cakra natural feature as the
ultima of certain problems of triangle geometry.

**Prologue**  
We first began our observations on the shared motifs in Indo-Iranian
traditions when we were around 8 years of age after our mother
introduced us to the Iranian epic, the Šahnāme. Over the years we built
up these correspondences even as we expanded our studies on our
ancestral Indo-European (IE) traditions. Several notable points have
also been uncovered in the work by occidental Indo-Europeanists such as
Dumezil, Watkins, and Puhvel. Yet our view of this is somewhat distinct
— given that we are insiders of one of the last surviving Indo-European
traditions, for us it is a reflection on our living tradition. We have
recently learnt a lot about the history of the early Indo-Europeans due
to archaeogenetics; this allows us to place certain things in a more
correct historical framework. Hence, we thought it worthwhile to put
down a few words on this matter. In particular, we felt that such an
exposition might be of use to the Hindu students of their ancestral
tradition — a kind of exploration of and introspection on tradition that
is unfortunately rather uncommon among our people. Indeed, we would go
as far as to state plainly that no amount of traditional mastery can
substitute for the insights that comparative IE studies can provide for
our tradition. Hence, ignoring it necessarily means an incomplete
understanding of tradition. Accordingly, we present here a few
comparative points on the IE epic traditions. Among the motifs we
uncovered was the Garuḍa motif which is common to the Iranian Rostam and
the Ikṣvāku heroes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa on our side. We also noticed the
motifs shared by the great pitāmahā Bhīṣma of the Hindu national epic
and Rostam the hero of the Iranian national epic. In the late 1990s we
learnt of the Iranicist Skjaervo’s work in this direction and found that
several points coincided with our investigations. Nevertheless, we feel
it might be useful to put down some of our thoughts in this this regard
against the larger background of the I-Ir epic tradition. However, right
at the outset, we should mention that this account is by no means aiming
to be a comprehensive presentation of our thoughts on the matter and
merely scratches the surface.

**The Hindu epic traditions**  
The Hindu itihāsa tradition, which is a continuation of the ancient IE
epic tradition that emerged on the Pontic–Caspian steppe, comes down to
us in the form of the extensive Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki and the Mahābhārata
of Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana. The first minutely captures the old “standard”
religion, i.e. the ancestral Aindra religion of the Indo-Europeans
\[Footnote 1\] as a humanized epic narrative focused on a historical
hero Rāmacandra and his brothers, who at some point after the ārya
conquest of Northern India occupied the dynastic seat of the ancient
Ikṣvāku monarchs. While it was secondarily reinterpreted by the
tradition which adopted the ancient IE deity Viṣṇu as its focus, it
still bears the emphatic stamp of the old Aindra religion (wherein
Lakṣmaṇa is the proper cognate of Viṣṇu) and also other ancient
para-Aindra traditions like that of the great god Vāyu and Yakṣa
Vaishravaṇa.

The Mahābhārata on the other hand might be termed the national epic
because whatever kernel of history it contains is intimately linked with
the emergence of a unified Indian state under the ārya-s in northern
India sometime around 1300 BCE. However, it should be understood that
the Mahābhārata is not history in the sense it is commonly understood
today. It is again a classic IE epic narrative which “pours” diverse
historical elements into the “bottle” of ancient mythic motifs
associated with the IE religion and its I-Ir reflex. This is made
explicit in the epic itself wherein its various characters are described
as incarnations of asura-s, deva-s and other divine beings — e.g. the
Bharadvāja hero Aśvatthāman is explicitly described as being the
combined incarnation of the mighty god Rudra along with the god of death
(Yama) and also the embodiment of lust and wrath (Mbh-“Pune” 1.61.66).
These older religious elements are combined with the newly emergent
strain of a Viṣṇu-focal system, the Sātvata tradition, emerging among
eponymous clans, and to an extant the the Rudra-focal system. In
historical terms, at least 4 distinct streams of “history” are melded in
an anachronistic fashion into the story frame of the Mahābharata,
despite the apparent chronological coherence in the epic: 1) The
historical elements of the old Kuru-Pāñcāla confederation; 2) the
emergence of Pāṇḍu power and their dynasty; 3) The Sātvata cycle with
their heroes like Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra, Balarāma, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and
Sātyaki (pañcavīra-s) among others; 4) The hero Bhīṣma.

**The Iranic epic traditions**  
Sadly, the Iranic epic traditions have not come down to us in the
pristine form of the Hindu epic traditions due the destruction of the
Iranian empire and the satellite Iranic states by Islam and the cult of
Jesus. There are two rather distinct streams of the Iranic epic
tradition that have come down to us: 1) The Caucasian stream that is
represented by the Nart epic material represents the traditions of the
Northern Saka-s, Sarmatians (Sairima) and the Alans (Airya). The word
Nart itself is a cognate of Sanskrit nṛ with a deep PIE etymology.
Unfortunately, the remnants of these peoples were steam-rolled by the
Christian Russians during their conquest of the region in the 1800s.
Starting with Shora Begmurzin Nogma down to Colarusso’s good compendium
the surviving material of these peoples has been collated and
translated. 2) The Iranian stream which has come down to us in the form
the Šah-nāme, the Garšasp-nāme, the Farāmarz-nāme and the Bānu
Gošasb-nāme among several others. Of these the Šah-nāme appears to have
been the model on which the other works were written. Importantly, these
are very late works coming from a time well after the Mohammedan
destruction of the Iranic religions. However, they appear to contain
material from a much earlier Sassanian collation of the epic material in
middle Persian the Khwadāy-nāmag. Of them, the Šah-nāme is well edited
and studied. But recently the work of Iranicists like Gazerani and
others has provide a lot of new material from the other epic cycles.
Much of our discussion will be on material that can be gleaned from the
Šah-nāme and the more recently presented texts. The Šah-nāme is an
anachronistic medley of old I-Ir mythology, main-line (i.e.
Zoroastrian-allied) Iranian epic tradition, the epic tradition of
Sakastana (the region encompassing Eastern Iran, Balochistan and
southern Afghanistan in modern parlance, where the Saka-s had
established a kingdom starting around 2100 years ago), and the later
history of the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanians.

**Some examples of anachronism in the Šah-nāme**  
The lateness of the Šah-nāme is useful in one way: it allows us to
understand how epic anachronism evolves because some of the details
pertain to historical events that have independent records of their
actual unfolding. The later Iranians had only a vague memory of certain
periods of their history — in particular the Achaemenid period. In
contrast, in non-Šah-nāme histories, including accounts of their rival,
the Greeks, this period is remembered as one of their most glorious
periods graced by great monarchs like Cyrus, Cambyses and Darius.
Strikingly, the Iranians remember the dramatic Achaemenid architecture
under names like Takht-i-Jamshid or Naqsh-i-Rostam, thus projecting
their constructions to the ancient past to associate them with epic
heroes like Yima Kshaeta (Jamshid) and Rostam. A parallel phenomenon is
seen among the Hindus where temples built by historical kings are
sometimes projected back to the time of the Pāṇḍava-s with complete loss
of memory of the real builder among the masses. This chronological
disconnect is most dramatically reproduced in the Šah-nāme in the
transition between the ancient period — a blend of main-line Iranian and
Sakastanian tradition — and the historical period beginning with
Alexander of Macedon’s invasion and destruction of the Iranian empire.

The way the historical period is introduced is via Bahman, the last of
the ancient kings, who puts an end to the lineage of Rostam. Bahman was
smitten by the beauty of his own daughter Homāya and engaged in
incestuous coitus with her. The result was the son named Dārāb (=Darius
the Great). He made Homāya succeed him but this displeased his other son
Sāsān through his original wife. This Sāsān is said to have hence left
for India where he married a Hindu woman to give rise to a long line of
Sāsān-s who eventually gave rise to the founder of the Sassanian dynasty
(see below for a parallel account in the clan of Rostam which might have
bearing on the origin of the Pallava-s of South India). Some other
accounts instead place this account of Sāsān in Nishapur. In Iran itself
Dārāb became the ruler and marching on the Greeks defeated them. He then
took Nāhīd the daughter of the Macedonian king Filakus as his wife. But
soon after impregnating her, Dārāb sent her back to Macedon repelled by
her bad smell from poor hygiene. There she gave birth to Sekander
(=Alexander of Macedon). In Iran his other wife gave him a son named
Dārā (=Darius-III).

Sekander with Arsṭālīs (=Aristotle) as his minister refused to pay
tribute to Dārā resulting in a war. After facing successive defeats Dārā
fled to Kerman with Sekander in hot pursuit. Dārā sent a message to
Porus (Paurava) the king of the Hindus to help. But before Porus could
send assistance Dārā was stabbed by his own ministers. As he lay dying
he gave his daughter Roxana in marriage to Sekander, asking him to
preserve Avesta and the uphold Zoroastrian religion. Alexander killed
Dārā’s assassins and made himself the emperor of Iran. Then Keyd
(=Āmbhi), a king of the Hindus, sent him a Brāhmaṇa philosopher, a
physician, a beautiful woman as a wife and an akṣaya-madirā-pātra.
Pleased with these gifts Sekander spared him, attacked Porus and
eventually defeated him.

It is immediately apparent that this tradition preserves a nucleus of
history, i.e. the account of the destruction of the Achaemenid empire by
Alexander followed by his going “native” by adopting Iranian customs to
the distaste of his Macedonian and Greek entourage. However, we can also
see a melding of mythic motifs and anachronistic conflation and
telescoping of various historical elements: 1) the incest of Bahman is
an old motif (c.f. the incest of Prajāpati from the Ṛgveda onwards). 2)
the great historical rulers like Cyrus, Darius the Great etc are either
forgotten conflated into the single character of Dārāb. 3) The Sassanian
dynasty’s foundation is ahistorically coupled with the Achaemenid
dynasty. Here, one may note that the supposed Hindu wife of Sāsān could
be a motif that was recycled from the story of Farāmarz, the son of
Rostam, who is said to have obtained his wife from an Indian island
after rescuing her from a demonic Triśiras Tvāṣṭra-like daeva. This
might also reflect a historical memory of a noted Sassanian emperor
marrying a Gupta princess. 4) Alexander and Darius-III are made
half-brothers — bringing in an old IE motif of the clash of clansman
(e.g. Kaurava-s and Pāṇḍava-s).

With regard to Alexander it may be noted that one stream of Iranian
tradition clearly remembers him as the “accursed, demonic one” who
destroyed the Zoroastrian scriptures during his assault on Persepolis.
In contrast, this tradition mentions Darius asking him to preserve the
Avesta. It is conceivable that the two accounts preserve different
aspects of the actual history — Alexander initially destroyed the
Iranian religious center of Persepolis and brutally killed Spitamenes,
the descendant of Zarathustra, who valiantly led the Iranian resistance
against the Macedonian invaders. Indeed, the Iranian tradition that
remembers the “accursed Alexander” specifically mentions his killing of
Zoroastrian ritualists, i.e., Dasturs and Mobeds. On the other hand,
Alexander adopting Iranian customs after the conquest of their empire
might reflect the fact that he did eventual allow the restoration of
Zoroastrian rituals in Iran. Likewise, in India too while certain Hindu
sources close to the time (e.g. Yuga-purāṇa) remember the yavana-s as
barbarous, we also know that they eventually extensively adopted and
supported Hindu traditions in the so-called Indo-Greek kingdoms.

Thus, for a moment if we imagine a scenario where all alternative
narratives of the period of history under consideration were lost and
only the Šah-nāme survived then we would be left with a coherent
narrative that despite its historical kernel does not capture the actual
unfolding of events or relationships between the characters in it.
Hence, this is something important to bear in mind while trying to read
history in related epic narratives like the Mahābhārata — there is
likely a historical pith to the narrative but it might not represent the
actuality. This situation starkly comes to the fore as we move further
back in time with respect to the Iranic and Hindu epic traditions.
However, in both cases we are not entirely lost because we have the
parallel records, often from the older scriptural texts like the Veda
and the Avesta. We shall consider this by taking up the case of the clan
of Rostam in the Iranian epic tradition.

**The clan of Rostam and the intertwining of the Sakastana and main-line
Iranian traditions**  
Reading the Šah-nāme one will be left with little doubt that Rostam was
the greatest Iranian hero and that his clan consistently produced a
whole line of such heroes (and heroines). This is quite like the
Pāṇḍava-s in the Hindu national epic. Yet there is something striking
about this family: except for its legendary founder it finds no mention
at all in the Avesta, despite that text mentioning several Iranian
heroes and ritualists who in the Šah-nāme are associated with the clan
of Rostam. This strange situation closely parallels the conundrum we
encounter in Hindu tradition where, the Veda mentions several Kuru-s,
Pāñcāla-s and Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra, who appear in the Mahābhārata but
almost completely fails to mention its main heroes, the Pāṇḍava-s.

Turning to the Avesta we see the following hero/ritualist figures who
also figure in the Šah-nāme under their New Persian names given in a
certain order that apparently reflects history: 1) Gaya Maretan (=SN:
Keyumars) the primordial puruṣa of the Iranian world. 2) Haošyanha
Paradāta (=SN: Hushang) the great ruler. 3) Takshma Urupi (=SN:
Tahmuras) the great warrior. 4) Yima Vaivanant Kshaeta (=SN: Jamshid).
5) The interlude of the demon Azi Dahāka (=SN: Zohak). 6) Thraetaona
Athwya (=SN: Feridun), who smites the Azi with his vazra (=SN: Gurz). 6)
Keresāspa (=SN: Garšasp) the gadā-wielding warrior. 7) The kavi-s. These
include among others Kavi Usan= (SN: Kay Us), Kavi Kavāta, Kavi Aipivohu
and Kavi Haosrava (=SN: Kay Khosraw). 8) Zarathuštra. 9) Vīštāspa.

Now one can see that several of these early characters are shared in
some form with the Hindus and mostly appear right from the RV onward: 1)
Gaya Amartya. 2) Yama Vaivasvata Kṣatriya. 3) Ahi Dāsa. 4) Trita Āptya
who, in the battles with the demons, assists Indra who wields the vajra.
5) Kṛśāśva, the “father” of the weapons. 6) Uśanas Kāvya. 7) Perhaps
Iṣṭāśva. Some of these are gods while other are demons and yet others
legendary men. These features along with their early appearance in both
Indian and Iranian tradition suggests that they belong to the common
Indo-Iranian past on the steppes.

What is notable is that neither this early Iranian nor the Hindu
tradition remembers Rostam or most of his clan with the exception of
Keresāspa, who is regarded as its founder in the Šah-nāme. In the early
Iranian tradition of the Avesta he is remembered as an enormously strong
man with his great gadā. He has a nearly semi-divine status (much like
in Viśvāmitra’s mention of him in the Rāmāyaṇa) and his fravashi (
![\\sim](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pitṛ) is called upon by the Zoroastrians to protect them from rapacious
attackers or thieves. He also slays a dreaded Ganderewa (Skt: Gandharva)
who attacks the “good principle” in the world and several other
adversaries. Notably, he is given the epithet naire-manah, i.e. of manly
mind. This epithet becomes the name of his son Nariman in the Šah-nāme.
In the surviving Pahlavi exegesis and the Dēnkard, he is termed Sāmān
Kersāsp. Now, the epithet Sāmān is the name of his grandson as per
Šah-nāme. Thus, it appears that the epithets of the ancient hero
Keresāspa were used as names to provide a genealogy that connects Rostam
to Keresāspa. Despite his heroic stature, he is also mentioned as
sinning: as per the Pahlavi exegesis he worshiped images like the
Hindus, while the Bundahišn describes this as worship of daeva-s by
Sāmān. We suspect that behind these allusions lies a faint memory of
Keresāspa belonging to the layer of the “un-divided” old daiva religion
prior to Zarathuštra’s counter-religious modifications.

Thus, the Šah-nāme gives the lineage of Rostam as in Figure 1:

![Rostam1.png](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/rostam1.png)Figure
1. The figures are scaled according to their “importance” in the Iranic
epic traditions. Some of the more “apocryphal” descendants of Rostam and
his brother Zavāra are left out.

From Zāl onward we see considerable detail in the accounts of the
heroes/heroines of the clan. However, many of these details are ancient
mythic motifs. These include:  
![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
The romance of Zāl and Rūdāba. This encompasses classic motifs of the
hero winning a beautiful wife from the enemy side found in many
traditions. Specifically, it connects Zāl the Airya hero to Rūdāba who
has Azi Dahāka as her ancestor, thereby bringing in the demonic element
in the ancestry of the mighty hero Rostam. Her Hindu affinities are
hinted by her father bearing the name Mahārāja in an Iranic
transmutation. From an Iranian stand point the daeva-worshiper would be
affiliated with the entities like Azi Dahāka. Such pairings between the
“daiva” and the “dāsa” or “dānava” figures are seen across the IE world.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Zāl was born albino (c.f. Pāṇḍu) and was nursed by the Garuḍa-like
divine bird meregha Saēna (=Skt śyena; SN: Simorgh), who gave him 3 of
his feathers asking him to burn them whenever he needed the bird’s
assistance. Rūdāba was about to die while giving birth to Rostam due his
gigantic size. It was then that Zāl called for Simorgh who taught him
the cesarean procedure to save his wife and son: The bird first asked
Zāl to anesthetize his wife by giving her wine. Then it asked him to
perform the cesarean section and take out Rostam. Post-surgery it
revealed the herbs to heal her wound and the final healing was achieved
by the stroking of Rūdāba with the feathers of Simorgh (see below). This
Simorgh is mentioned as bearing the medicines on his tree in the
incantation to the god Rashnu:  
ýatcit ahi rashnvô ashâum upa avãm vanãm ýãm saênahe ýâ hishtaite
maidhîm zrayanghô vourukashahe ýâ hubish eredhwô-bish ýâ vaoce
vîspô-bish nãma ýãm upairi urvaranãm vîspanãm taoxma nidhayat  
Whether you, O holy Rashnu! are on the tree of the eagle, that stands in
the middle of the sea Vouru-Kasha, that is called the tree of good
remedies, the tree of powerful remedies, the tree of all remedies, and
on which rest the seeds of all plants; we invoke (Yašt to Rashnu-17).

This is consistent with the bird’s role as the teacher of the medical
procedure to his protege Zāl and matches that of his cognate Garuḍa
Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi who possesses cures. In the Rāmāyaṇa, he cures Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa when they were paralyzed by Meghanāda’s poison missile (see
below) and Hindu tradition remembers the bird deity as the teacher of
the medicine deity Dhanvantari:  
nārāyaṇāṃśo bhagavān svayaṃ dhanvantari mahān ।  
purā samudra-mathane samuttasthau mahodadheḥ॥  
sarva-vedeṣu niṣṇāto mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ ।  
śiśyo hi vainateyasya śaṃkarasyośiśyakaḥ॥  
The great Dhanvantari is a part of Nārāyaṇa himself. Formerly, he arose
during the churning of the ocean. Learned in all the Veda-s and an adept
in mantra-s and tantra-s he is the student of Vainateya and an adjunct
student of Śankara.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
The conflict of Sohrab and Rostam. This famous episode is replete with
various motifs shared with the Mahābhārata. Rostam going to the foreign
land to acquire a woman (Tahmina) is reminiscent of Arjuna going to the
distant land to acquire Citrāṅgadā and Ulūpī. Tahmina approaching Rostam
by herself for a son is again parallel to the approach of these
Mahābhārata characters, especially Ulūpī. The consequence of their
intercourse is a son who does not recognize the father but possesses
similar martial ardor. They finally fight in an encounter that results
in the death of one of them. In the case Rostam the son, Sohrab, is
slain while Babhruvāhana slew Arjuna. In both cases there is the
possibility of revival with a magical panacea. In the case of Arjuna
that is obtained but Rostam fails to obtain it for Sohrab. Finally, one
could also point out that the setting of the death of Sohrab at Rostam’s
hand is in a great war and parallels the killing of Karṇa by Arjuna. In
this regard, it may be observed that Rostam gives Tahmina an ornament to
tie on their child before leaving her. This might be compared to the
ornaments which Karṇa obtained at birth from Sūrya. In the case of
Rostam, a similar incident again plays out with his other son Farāmarz
and his Amazonian warrior daughter Bānu Gošasb who fight Rostam and his
brother Zavāra. However, in this case they recognize each other before
anyone is killed.

These are just a few examples of some ancient motifs being woven into
the history of the clan of Rostam. The most striking part is that they
play out during the reign of the Kavi-s as kings of Iran. While the
Kavi-s are repeatedly mentioned in the Avesta not once are these
Rostamian heroes mentioned alongside them. Thus, it almost appears as
though they were superimposed on to the older history of the Kavi-s who
are now reconfigured as kings of Iran. The end of the reign of Kavi
Haosrava in the Šah-nāme bears a motif which is paralleled in the
Mahābhārata. At the end of his long reign Kavi Haosrava renounced his
kingdom for an ascetic existence and left for the mountains with 8
pahlavān-s. There their people beseech them not to leave the kingdom. Of
the 8 pahlavān-s Zāl, Rostam and Gutarza (Gōdarz) \[Footnote 2\] return
to the state. The remaining **5 pahlavān-s**, Ṭus, Gēv, Faribarz, Bizhan
and Gostaham continued with the Kavi until they reached a spring, where
he took a bath, chanted the Avesta, bade farewell to his friends and
vanished. The 5 pahlavān-s died shortly thereafter in the mountains in a
snowstorm while searching for Kavi Haosrava. This motif to our knowledge
is uniquely shared by the Indo-Iranians and is not found among other
IEans. It parallels the last journey of the Pāṇḍava-s to the great
mountain in Central Asia. 5 of them also die in the snowy mountains in
the Mahābharata but the emperor Yudhiṣṭhira reaches the realm of the
gods. On the Iranian side, Kavi Haosrava too does not die and awaits the
coming of the Saošyant-s (Iranian Kalkin-like figures) at the end of
time and assists them in those final days.

So where does the cycle of the Rostamians appear to enter Iranian
tradition? Rostam is traditionally associated with Sakastana. In
contrast, the Kavi-s being present in the Avesta itself can be
associated with the mainline Zoroastrian tradition in Iran. Thus, it
appears that the Iranian epic tradition of the Šah-nāme was formed by
the amalgamation of this mainline tradition with the Rostamian cycle
brought in by the Saka-s during their invasion of outer Asia and the
conquest the region that came to be known as Sakastana.

**Rostam, heroes in Hindu epics, and Bhīṣma**  
At first sight there is no reason to connect Rostam and Bhīṣma who
superficially appear to play rather distinct roles in their respective
epics. Indeed, some of the more overt features of Rostam can be
identified with other heroes in the Hindu epics. For instance, above we
mentioned the father-son killing motif shared with Arjuna. His
inheritance of “divine weapons” like the the bow of Keresāspa and vazra
of Thraetaona Athwya remind one of Rāmacandra, the hero of the Rāmāyaṇa,
who obtained the weapons of Kṛśāśva via Viśvāmitra. His proficiency with
the vazra of Thraetaona Athwya, which is portrayed more like a gadā, his
strength and frame, which are explicitly compared to an elephant, and
his elephant-killing capacity remind one of Bhīmasena. Indeed, his title
in the Iranian epic would be rendered in old Iranian as Takhma-tanu:
mighty bodied. Consistent with this, in the Šah-nāme, Rostam is
repeatedly presented as lifting giant rocks. Again Rostam’s battle with
the powerful king Kok-e Kuhzād, who is said to rule the land between
Sakastana and India from a powerful mountain stronghold, resembles the
famous showdown between Bhīma and Jarāsaṃdha at his stronghold of
Girivraja.

However, a closer look reveals many specific parallels between Rostam
and Bhīṣma: In generic terms both of them are great warriors in the old
IE mold who are basically unconquerable. Neither of them could be killed
in a straight battle and certain tricks had to be used to finally kill
them (see below). Both are also very long-lived: Rostam’s life
encompasses the reigns of nearly all the Kavi-s. Similarly, the
pitāmahā’s life spans the entire period from Śaṃtanu all the way to the
time after Yudhiṣṭhira becomes king. Most interestingly, the name of
Rostam’s mother Rūdāba means river water. Rostam’s own name in the old
Iranian would have been \*Rautas-takhma: river-strong. This is a rather
strong homology to Bhīṣma who is the son of the goddess of the river
Gaṅgā. Both of them are dynastic guardians who never attempt to become
kings themselves though they might act as viceroys. Notably, in being
dynastic guardians both side with the less-deserving or the
less-legitimate successor to the throne. On the Hindu side, Bhīṣma
despite professing his love for the successors of Pāṇḍu stands firmly by
Duryodhana. On the Iranian side, Rostam with his circle of pahlavān-s
favor Kavi Haosrava on the throne as opposed to the legitimate heir
Faribarz.

Then there is their death: both had to be killed by a stratagem: In
Bhīṣma’s case it involved the use of Śikaṇḍin as the front with Arjuna
striking from behind. In the case of Rostam, the king of Kabul used his
jealous half-brother Shaghād borne of a slave woman to Zāl to lead the
former to his death. Zāl had sent Shaghād to live with his tributary the
king of Kabul because his ritualists had foretold that he would bring
destruction to his house. They hatched a plan to kill Rostam by feigning
a fight in course of which he had also insulted Rostam. Then Shaghād
went over to Rostam and asked him to attack the king of Kabul. When
Rostam and his full brother Zavāra arrived to attack Kabul, the king
claimed that he had accidentally misbehaved under the influence of
alcohol. The king then agreed for peace and asked Rostam and Zavāra to
join him in a hunt. In course of that Shaghād led Rostam to a trap which
they had set up — a pit full of spears. Rostam and his long-lived horse
fell into the pit and they were impaled through and through by the
spears. Somehow, Rostam climbed out due to his great strength and fooled
Shaghād by saying that his end was at hand. Then he asked Shaghād to
correct his ways and lead a proper life with Rostam’s powerful son
Farāmarz. Thus, appearing to let him go, Rostam asked for his bow and
two arrows in case a wild animal came to eat him as he lay dying.
Shaghād gave them to him but still fearing him ran away and hid behind a
tree. Rostam though dying from being pierced all over shot an arrow to
transfix Shaghād to the tree; then he died. In the mean time his brother
Zavāra had also also fallen in another spear-filled pit and died.
Thereafter, Rostam’s son Farāmarz filled with wrath did an “Aśvatthāman”
by slaying the king of Kabul with his entire family and wiping out the
city.

Both Bhīṣma and Rostam are impaled all over by arrows or spears. Despite
that they do not die immediately. Instead, they linger on only to die
after they have either completed their final wishes. Thus, in both their
birth and death these long-lived warriors of the Indian and Iranian
worlds are united.

**Rostam and Esfandiyār**  
Esfandiyār, old Iranic Spentdāta, is presented in the epic literature as
the son of Vīštāspa, the patron of Zarathuštra. He was a holy warrior
enforcing Zarathuštra’s counter-religion and his brother, the
idol-breaking Pešōtanū, is said to be an immortal who would lead
Zoroastrians against their enemies at the end of time \[Footnote 3\]. In
the epic tradition, his father asked Esfandiyār to get Rostam bound in
chains for his disregard towards the king. Moreover, Rostam was a
follower of the older (ancestral I-Ir) religion and did not want his
people to submit to the counter-religion Vīštāspa was pushing for. In
this regard a parallel is again seen with Keresāspa the legendary
ancestor of Rostam, who is presented as sinning by following the
demonized old religion as opposed to the creed of Zarathuštra.

Esfandiyār told his father that a respectable and aged warrior like
Rostam should not be disgraced thus, especially given that he had
faithfully served the the kings of Iran. But at his father’s insistence
Esfandiyār, Pešōtanū and the former’s sons went to arrest Rostam.
Esfandiyār sent his son Bahman to ask Rostam to submit. He agreed to
come and see the king but refused to be put in chains. He also offered
to apologize to the king if he felt offended but firmly refused the idea
of being bound. Pešōtanū suggested to his brother to accept this deal
but Esfandiyār refused and challenged Rostam to combat. While the two
were locked in an evenly poised combat, Rostam’s brother Zavāra and son
Farāmarz launched a counter-attack on Esfandiyār’s positions and killed
two of his sons, one of whom was apparently an Athravan. After a
prolonged fight Rostam’s mighty weapons failed to slay Esfandiyār but
the latter’s special arrows breached Rostam’s armor and severely wounded
him and his horse forcing him to retreat. It was at this moment he asked
his father Zāl for a strategy. Zāl called the great bird Simorgh (Av:
meregha Saēna) by burning one of the feathers it had given him
\[Footnote 4\]. The bird removed the 8 arrow-heads embedded in Rostam’s
flesh and soothed his wounds by stroking them with its feathers. It then
instructed Rostam to bind the wounds and stroke them with its feather
dipped in medicinal milk for a week for a complete a cure of Rostam and
also his horse. The bird was also displeased with Esfandiyār for he had
killed another eagle who was Simorgh’s associate \[Footnote 5\]. He then
revealed to Rostam the secret of slaying Esfandiyār. It asked Rostam to
make a double-headed arrow from the wood of the tamarisk tree and shoot
at his eyes with it. The bird then took him to a distant land to obtain
a branch of the tree and fashion the arrow. The next morning as the
fight resumed with much fury; Rostam shot this arrow and struck down
Esfandiyār.

However, Esfandiyār had a Zarathuštrian curse protecting him that
whoever is responsible for this death would suffer in this world and the
next. But Rostam told him that he should not be responsible because it
was his father who sent Esfandiyār to fight him despite knowing that he
would be slain by Rostam. Pešōtanū agreed that the blame was on Vīštāspa
and Esfandiyār for not accepting Rostam’s deal. Rostam then took care of
the upbringing and education of Esfandiyār’s surviving son Bahman.
However, once Rostam had died, Bahman remembered how the Sakastanian
heroes had killed his father and brothers. Wanting revenge for this he
suddenly attacked Rostam’s son Farāmarz and killed him (In some versions
Zavāra survived the pit-trap and was also killed in this attack of
Bahman). He also caged Zāl and devastated their realm.

This narrative is replete with several notable motifs:  
![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
We see ancient IE motif of the “Achilles heel” in the form of
Esfandiyār’s eyes. More specifically, the vulnerability of Esfandiyār is
similar to that of the Germanic god Baldr, who is killed by Loki’s plot
by making the blind deity Höðr throw a spear or shoot an arrow made of
mistletoe (to which he was vulnerable) at him. There is an apparent
record of this motif among the Algonquin first Americans in the tale of
their deity Glooskap and his rival Malsum (claimed by some to also bear
the name Lox). Here Glooskap and Malsum had vulnerabilities to certain
plants and owl feathers and eventually Glooskap slew Malsum with a fern
root. While there has been a proposal that this motif might have been
transmitted to the Northern Germanics during their contact with the New
World, its presence among the Iranics suggests to a more ancient origin
(Assuming the tale collected by Leland from the Algonquin is genuine).

The journey to a distant land to obtain the tamarisk tree missile can be
compared in the Hindu epic to Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa going to the abode of
Rudra to obtain the Pāśupata missile by means of which alone Jayadratha
could be killed. The curse protecting Jayadratha from Vṛddhakṣatra can
again be compared to that protecting Esfandiyār, which was likewise
deflected on to his father Vīštāspa.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
The feather motif: Zāl’s special connection to the great bird the
Simorgh comes to aid Rostam on at least two occasions — once during his
birth (see above) and again in this incident of his battle with
Esfandiyār. Now the use of the feather is a clear connection with an
ancient Indo-Iranian apotropaic ritual. On the Hindu side it is
specified in the Yajurveda as part of the famous Sautrāmaṇi ritual in
which the yajamāna is purified by the adhvaryu who strokes him with a
śyena (hawk or falcon) feather twice above the navel and once below
it:  
yā vyāghram̐ viṣūcikā । iti śyena-pattreṇa yajamānaṃ pāvayati ॥
Mānava-śrauta-sūtra 5.2.11.20

The mantra used in the process from the Maitrāyaṇi-saṃhitā is:  
yā vyāghraṃ viṣūcikobhau vṛkaṃ ca rakṣati ।  
śyenaṃ patatriṇaṃ siṃhaṃ semaṃ pātv aṃhasaḥ ॥  
My she, Viṣūcikā, who guards these two, the tiger and the wolf,  
The lion and the winged hawk, may she guard this man (the yajamāna) from
distress.  
A comparable ritual is also found in the Taittirīya-brāhmaṇa 2.6.1.5.

On the Iranian side we have comparable ritual in the Verethraghna Yašt
(34-35):  
verethraghnem ahuradhâtem ýazamaide  
We offer sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.

Zarathuštra asked Ahura Mazda:  
“O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent mind, creator of the material world,  
you O holy one! If I have a curse upon me, a spell cast upon me  
by the many men who hate me, what is the medicine for it?”

Ahura Mazda answered: “Take a feather of that bird with a wide wingspan,
the Varenjina bird, O Spitama Zarathuštra! With that feather you should
stroke your own body; with that feather you should back-hurl the spell
to the enemies.”

Finally, we have specific point regarding the eagle-feather motif: the
eagle helps Rostam in specie against the wounds of a difficult to
repulse missile and does so by removing the arrow-heads and the stroking
him with its feathers. This motif occurs in a rather similar form in the
Rāmāyaṇa. There, the fierce rakṣas hero Meghanāda strikes the Ikṣvāku
brothers with his nāga arrows. Riddled with Meghanāda’s arrows the two
fall unconscious on the field. They were then healed by Garuḍa by
stroking them with his wings and their power is doubled as a
consequence:

śara-jāla-ācitau vīrāv ubhau daśaratha ātmajau ।  
śara-talpe mahātmānau śayānāu rudhirokṣitau ॥ (R 6.50.3)  
The two mighty valiant sons of Daśaratha enmeshed in a web of arrows are
lying bleeding on a bed of arrows.

tato muhūrtad garuḍam vainateyam mahā balam ।  
vānarā dadṛśuḥ sarve jvalantam iva pāvakam ॥  
Then, all the monkeys saw in a moment Garuḍa, the son of Vinatā, of
great strength like a blazing fire.

tam āgatam abhiprekṣya nāgās te vipra-dudruvuḥ ।  
yais tau sat puruṣau baddhau śara bhūtair mahā-balau ॥  
Beholding him \[the great eagle arrive\], the snakes, which having
become great arrows had bound those two strong men, fled.

tataḥ suparṇaḥ kākutsthau dṛṣṭvā pratyabhinandya ca ।  
vimamarśa ca pāṇibhyām mukhe candra-sama-prabhe ॥  
Thereupon, the eagle, having seen the two Kākutstha heroes offered them
his good wishes, and with his wings stroked their faces that were
radiant like the moon.

vainateyena saṃspṛṣṭās tayoh samruruhur vraṇāḥ ।  
suvarṇe ca tanū snigdhe tayor āśu babhūvatuḥ ॥ 6.50.36-39  
Their wounds, stroked by the son of Vinatā were healed. Their bodies
quickly regained color and became smooth again.

**Some concluding remarks**  
What is the significance of these mythic motifs for actual history of
the Indo-Europeans? Archaeogenetics has finally offered us a framework
for early IE history barring that of the Anatolian branch, which still
remain somewhat mysterious. This is not the place to recount that in any
great detail but briefly: It appears that the early phase of IE
tradition corresponds to the Mikhaylovka culture starting around 3600
BCE in the Pontic–Caspian steppes north of the Black and the Caspian
Seas. This culture had expanded considerably across the steppes by
around 3300 BCE as the famous Yamnaya culture which likely spoke PIE
(whether ancestor Anatolian was included remains unclear). Starting
around 3000 BCE, PIE was starting to breakup into diverging dialects and
the first to split was the eastern branch leading to the Afanasievo
culture. This is probably the precursor of the Tocharian branch of IE.
Subsequently, the Yamnaya culture spread westwards and acquired
differing degrees genetic contribution from the earlier European
residents who themselves were an admixture of western hunter-gatherers
and west Asian/Anatolian farmers. This westward spread probably marks
the split of the early western Kentum dialects that led to Germanic, and
Italo-Celtic.

A population with the above European admixture likely moved backwards to
give rise to the Satem branches which then split up into Indo-Iranian
and Balto-Slavic by at least 2700 BCE. These were represented by the
successor cultures of the Yamnaya like the Poltavka. Studies in the past
4 years have shown that a male individual dated from 2925-2536 BCE from
the Poltavka culture bore the same Y-chromosome haplogroup as the
Indo-Aryans of India (R1a-Z93). It is hence likely that the Poltvaka or
similar cultures in the general middle Volga zone represent the
ancestral populations from which the Indo-Iranians expanded. We hold
that the early layer in the Vedic texts contain material from this
period with clear memories of/material from the even earlier period
closer to PIE (The exact scenario involves some complexities and will
not be elaborated here). The proto-Greeks and probably the
proto-Armenians (who were part of the kentum radiations) were also
likely in the vicinity of this and interacted with these early
Indo-Iranians. Subsequently, the Indo-Iranians expanded in two major
stages eventually reaching their historical homelands. The earliest of
these expansions is seen in the archaeological record as the Sintashta
culture. The detection of the cognate word of Skt marya (a young
man/warrior) in tablet from Tell Leilān in Syria dating 1800-1700 BCE
suggests that their thrust into Outer Asia had begun by then. From the
recently published genetic evidence, it appears that a massive military
force of Indo-Aryans invaded the Indian subcontinent sometime around
1900-1700 BCE after quickly outflanking the Central Asian
Bactria-Margiana complex and quickly conquered northern India to found
the first Indo-Aryan states in the region. The so called Kassite records
of Indo-Aryan deities suggest that smaller forces of Indo-Aryans were
also active in West Asia where they even formed the elite of the Mitanni
kingdom between 1600-1400 BC. The Iranian Aryans appear to have invaded
Iran only later and are attested in Elamite records via words like
Ašbayauda (horse-warrior).

Given this background, we suspect that the motif an apocalyptic war,
which is common to several branches of Indo-European was something that
emerged in the PIE tradition. It goes without saying that the early
IEans were a warlike people. It is conceivable that their initial
expansions marking the breakup of PIE was accompanied by internal wars
among the early IE elite. Likewise, their expansions that followed
brought them into intense conflict with other alien groups — traces of
these are even seen in the archaeogenetic evidence. This probably gave
rise to 2 epic motifs, namely that of the fight “within the family” and
the battle with hostile aliens, which might have involved abduction of
women. Now, one may see these motifs were at the heart of the
proto-itihāsa-s of the IE people. They were then reused in the
narrations of various historical battles that the different branches
fought far from their original homeland in their new homelands like
India or Greece or Western Europe.

The weight of the evidence suggests that there was a fairly protracted
period of an undivided Indo-Iranian period (probably
![\\sim](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
500 years). In this period they probably continued to interact to a
degree with the sister śatam branches (Balto-Slavic) and also the
precursors of the Greco-Armenians resulting in some sharing of specific
traditions. It is conceivable that the motifs such as the “river-born”,
long-lived warrior emerged in this period and was woven into the later
epics of both the Iranian and Hindu traditions. While these motifs were
perhaps of early Indo-Iranian origin, we do see fainter echoes in the
Greek tradition. For instance, Achilles is “made strong” by the River
Styx, even as Rostam is “river-strong”. While motifs like the great
eagle deity are probably of PIE or even earlier vintage \[Footnote 6\],
it likely developed specific elements in this undivided Indo-Iranian
period.

Admittedly, the Iranian epics are late and hardly pristine in their
preservation. Yet, they illustrate an important process in
epic-building, namely the weaving of narratives from different periods
into a completely consistent yet anachronistic end-product. We posit
that a similar process has been at work in the Mahābhārata, albeit at a
much earlier time. This brought together the heroes of multiple
Indo-Aryan traditions into a single whole, with the Pāṇḍava-s being
superimposed onto the earlier Kuru-Pāñcāla epic. It is notable that even
on the Iranian side we have at least three distinct elements being
melded: the heroes of the undivided I-Ir period like Kṛśāśva, the heroes
of the Zoroastrian counter-religious movement and the Sakastanian
tradition around the clan of Rostam. It is notable that in some
narratives there is clear memory of the religious strife between the
Zoroastrian partisans and various adherents of the older religion, which
include the clan of Rostam. However, overtime the latter were brought
into the Zoroastrian fold and presented as champions of that
counter-religious tradition. For example, in the Farāmarz-nāme we have
Farāmarz debate with brāhmaṇa-s in India, convert them to Zoroastrianism
and make forsake the worship of images of daeva-s.

Similarly, we propose that in India the Pāṇḍava-s who originally
represented a secondary invasionary wave who overthrew the old Kuru-s,
were subsequently presented as legitimate successors of the Kuru-s at
Hastināpura. We also suspect that some of the heroic elements of the
Sakastanian epic cycle and the Mahābhārata draw from a common tradition
that simultaneously interacted with both the Iranian and Indo-Aryan
mainlines. In this regard we may bring attention to the Pārataraja-s who
founded a kingdom between
![\\sim](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
125-300 CE in the region neighboring Sakastana in what’s today
Balochistan. The names of their rulers include among other wise
typically Iranic names (e.g. \*Yodamithra, \*Bagamithra,
\*Mithra-takhma) also names of the Pāṇḍava-s — Arjuna and Bhīmārjuna.
This points to a tradition of honoring the Pāṇḍava-s even among these
Iranic groups.

Finally, we may note that Iranicists like Gazerani and Pourshariati see
the mark of much later history from the time of the rise of the
Parthians in the epics of the Sakastanian heroes. They note that the
powerful family of Surena, which played a central role in the great
Parthian victory against the Romans led by Marcus Crassus, claimed
descent from the clan of Rostam. This is indeed conceivable for certain
narratives; however, we hold that the core narrative of the Sakastanian
heroes is still of a much older period which was brought by the Sakas
and Parthians (Pahlavān-s). Where we see this later narrative being
superimposed onto to the earlier epic is in the likely Iranic memory of
the foundation of the Pallava dynasty in southern India. We know from
the Andhra inscriptions that their kings referred to their Parthian
adversaries as Pallava-s. In the Iranic epic of Shahriyār we learn of
the account of Sohrāb’s descendants. In course of his wanderings Rostam
fought with Sohrāb’s son Barzu but learnt of his identity and brought
him back to his land. Barzu had a son named Shahriyār, who eventually
had a conflict with his cousins descending from Farāmarz. Furious over
this he decided to leave Sakastana for India. He first went to Kashmir
but the king of Kashmir was related to Farāmarz’s family by marriage and
was his ally. Hence, he proceeded further to southern India towards the
island of Sarandip (Shri Lanka) where he married the daughter of the
Hindu king Arjang. He aided Arjang in his many battles, killed a demon
called Sagsar, and later ascended the throne after his father-in-law.
Whether a recent descendant of Rostam came to India in “real” history
remains is hard to test. Nevertheless, it is entirely likely that that
Iranics who founded the Pallava dynasty in south India were from
Surena’s clan and thus claimed descent from Rostam. Hence, a memory of
their settling in Southern India was likely superimposed back into the
epic narratives of their old heroes.

Footnote 1: When we say Aindra we do not mean that the deity under the
name Indra was present among the ancestral IEans. It merely means that
Indra represents the Hindu reflex of an ancestral IE deity who was his
cognate. In the rest of this account we shall use similar terms for
other deities with proto-IE cognates, like Viṣṇu.

Footnote 2: Gutarza (Gōdarz) is believed by some to be the Parthian king
Gutarza Gēvaputhra of history superimposed backwards into the age of the
Kavi-s. We are not certain of this hypothesis. It is notable that Gēv is
the husband of Rostam’s daughter Bānu Gošasb and the father of another
Rostamian hero Bizhan. His name appears as the father of that of the
historical Gōdarz and is at odds with the Šah-nāme.

Footnote 3: This is laid out in the Zoroastrian text known as the Zand i
Wahman Yasn where in a Kalkin-like showdown he would be assisted by the
deities Mithra, Rashnu, Sraosha and Verethraghna in an idol- and
temple-smashing spree against the daeva worshipers.

Footnote 4: From the Farāmarz-nāme we learn that this ritual involved
burning a piece of the feather with the agarwood, i.e. Skt Aguru, which
is also used a fragrant material burnt in the ritual to the
Ucchuṣma-Rudra-s specified in the Atharvaveda-pariśiṣṭha. It is also
widely used in Hindu medicine.

Footnote 5: This attack on the holy bird is also an indication of the
clash between the religion of Sakastanian heroes like Zāl, Rostam and
Farāmarz, who are repeatedly helped by the great Saēna and the partisans
of Zarathuštra.

Footnote 6: Probably, this developed from the observation of eagle
taking back pharmacologically active plants to their nests.

Students of the history of Hindu mathematics are well-acquainted with
Nārāyaṇa-paṇḍita’s sophisticated treatment of various aspects of
combinatorics and integer sequences in his Gaṇita-kaumudī composed in
1356 CE. In that work he gives about 43 problems relating to
combinatorics. Continuing with our study of various aspects of
Nārāyaṇa’s work using a modern lens, in this note we shall look at some
of his problems in combinatorics and what a modern (low level) student
can learn from them.

The first problem we shall look at introduces a student to the discrete
factorial function
![n!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using a verse in the Vasantatilakā meter;  
Problem-1:  
cāpeṣu khaḍga-ḍamarūka-kapāla-pāśaiḥ khaṭvāṅga-śūla-phaṇi-śakti-yutair
bhavanti ।  
anyonya-hasta-kalitaiḥ kati mūrtibhedāḥ śambho harer iva
gadā’ri-saroja-śaṅkhaiḥ ॥  
With a bow (1), an arrow (2), a sword (3), a double-drum (4), a skull
(5), a lasso (6), a skull-topped rod (7), a trident (8), a snake (9) and
a spear (10) — by changing them from one hand to another how many
different images of Rudra come to be? Likewise, of Viṣṇu with a mace
(1), a wheel (2), a lotus (3) and a conch (4).

For Rudra with 10 arms the answer is
![10!=3628800](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%21%3D3628800&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
whereas for Viṣṇu it is
![4!=24](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%21%3D24&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This problem was well-known among earlier Hindu scientists and is not
original to Nārāyaṇa. Here, he is merely reusing this verse without any
change from Bhāskara-II’s Līlāvatī. In the case of Viṣṇu, each of these
24 permutations have a specific name starting from Keśava. There are
correspondingly 24 forms of Lakṣmī. These forms are an important aspect
of the Pañcarātra system where they are counted along with the 4 basic
vyūha-s in the śuddha-mūrti-s (“Platonic” forms) in texts like the
Nārada-pāñcarātra and are attested in iconography across the Indosphere.
The general use of permutations in various endeavors is mentioned by
Nārāyaṇa after he provides the procedure for writing out the
permutations:  
aṅka-prastāra-vidhiś caivaṃ mūrtiprabhedānām ।  
sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-dha-nīty eṣāṃ vīṇāyā nikvaṇānāṃ ca ॥  
This procedure generating the permutation of digits is also used in
permutations of images \[of deities\], sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni (the notes
of Hindu music) and the notes produced by the vīṇā.

Problem-2 (A verse again in the Vasantatilakā meter):  
dhātrī lavaṅga-dala-kesara nāga-railā vakraṃ kaṇāḥ samaricāḥ sasitā
bhavanti ।  
ekādibhiś ca militair gadināṃ katīha cūrṇāni bho vada gadāpanude gadajña
॥  
O apothecary, how many different different disease-curing spice-powders
come from mixing one etc (i.e. 1, 2, 3…) of gooseberry, clove, cinnamon,
saffron, ginger, cardamom, Indian may apple (*Sinopodophyllum
hexandrum*), cumin, pepper and sugar?

This type of problem is encountered widely in Hindu literature — we find
a discussion of the combinations of tastes in the medical saṃhitā-s of
Caraka and Suśruta. Subsequently, the great naturalist Varāhamihira in
![\\sim](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
550 CE discussed the production of various perfumes by combinations of
basic scents. Such combinations are also discussed by king Bhojadeva
Paramāra in his chemical treatise in the 1000s of the CE. Related
problems are also taken up in Bhāskara-II and by the polymath Śārṅgadeva
in his musical treatise. This particular problem is rather typical of
the combinations used in preparation of drugs in Āyurveda. As a
pharmacological aside the Indian may apple if properly used can be quite
effective treating tumors caused by certain papillomaviruses. Returning
to the solution of the problem, we need to recall the formula for
combinations:

![{}^nC_k =
\\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5EnC_k+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bn%21%7D%7Bk%21%28n-k%29%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Let
![N](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the total number of powders that can be created via each set of
combinations: by taking 1 at a time we get 10, by taking 2 at time we
get
![{}^{10}C_2=45](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%7B10%7DC_2%3D45&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and so on. Thus, we get:

![N=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{k=1}^{10}
{}^{10}C_k=1023](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7B10%7D+%7B%7D%5E%7B10%7DC_k%3D1023&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

In Hindu tradition, the study of combinations and their sum goes back to
at least the Chandas-śāstra (the treatise on meters) of Piṅgala. This
has been extensively discussed in the literature and we present it only
briefly:

pare pūrṇam । pare pūrṇam iti । CS 8.34-35  
Complete it by using the two distal ends. Repeat to complete using the
distal flanking ends.

While these original sūtra-s of Piṅgala are difficult to directly
understand, they have been explained in the glosses of several authors
since (e.g. Kedāra-bhaṭṭa and Halāyudha). The two sūtra-s specify the
construction of the Meru-prastāra or the combinatorial triangle. The
first sūtra implies that you write out the flanking cells with 1
corresponding to row
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad {. } \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad {. }
\\quad {. } \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad {. } \\quad {. } \\quad {. } \\quad 1

The second sūtra implies that you fill in the interior cell by repeating
the procedure:

![1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 2 \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 3 \\quad 3
\\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 4 \\quad 6 \\quad 4 \\quad 1 \\\\ 1 \\quad 5

While this is extensively discussed in the context of Chandas, one can
also find a clear algorithm in Bhāskara-II’s Līlāvatī using the
combination function to produce not just the combinatorial triangle
(Meru) but also any row or cell of it. Thus, from the Meru we can write
the formula for the expansion of a binomial as:

![(x+y)^n=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{k=0}^{n}{}^nC_k x^k
y^{n-k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2By%29%5En%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7B%7D%5EnC_k+x%5Ek+y%5E%7Bn-k%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This tells us that the null-product or
![0!=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0%21%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(implicitly provided in Bhāskara-II’s algorithm: there only 1 way of not
choosing anything). The magnitudes of the
![k^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-combination
or the values assumed by the combination function for a given
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
changes determine the values of the individual terms of the above
expansion. Hence, we use the problem-2 to introduce and illustrate to
students the shape of the binomial distribution (Figure 1). Since the
Meru itself can be seen as the triangle of
![(1+1)^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B1%29%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the formula for the sum of combinations for a given
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as,

![N=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{k=0}^{n}
{}^{n}C_k=2^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%7B%7D%5E%7Bn%7DC_k%3D2%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If we leave out the null combination
![k=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get
![N=2^n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D2%5En-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as in the problem-2 where
![N=2^{10}-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D2%5E%7B10%7D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

As this note is part historical and part educational (for a low-level
student), let us next consider another binomial expansion that played a
cornerstone role in the origin of modern mathematics,

![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}
\\left(1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cleft%281%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can intuitively sense based on the easily-determined first 3 terms
that it might converge to some number between 2 and 3 but what is that
number? We can experimentally see that the above expression converges
slowly: for
![n=10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get 2.6; for
![n=100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get 2.7; for
![n=200](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D200&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have 2.71. This is exactly where Jakob Bernoulli got to when he first
encountered this problem and realized that it was converging to
something around 2.71. However, we can do better by determining the
limit:

![\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}

Taking the limit ![n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:

![\\displaystyle \\lim n \\to \\infty \\left(1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^n=
\\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{1}{n!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim+n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty+%5Cleft%281%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5En%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, our limit is the infinite sum of the reciprocal of the factorials.
This is much faster-converging and with just 10 terms converges to 7
places after the decimal point to 2.7182818… The importance of this
limit and the number it converges to comes to fore in another central
result in the emergence of modern mathematics: What is the rate of
change (derivative) of the logarithmic function? Let us start with a
logarithm taken to some base
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e.
![y=\\log_b(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Clog_b%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence,

![\\displaystyle \\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\\lim\_{\\delta x \\to 0}
\\dfrac{\\log_b(x+\\delta x)-\\log_b(x)}{\\delta x} =\\log_b\\left(
\\dfrac{x+\\delta x}{x}\\right)^{1/\\delta x} =\\log_b\\left(

=\\log_b\\left( 1+\\dfrac{\\delta x}{x}\\right)^{x/\\delta x \\times
1/x} =\\dfrac{1}{x}\\log_b\\left( 1+\\dfrac{\\delta

x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cdfrac%7Bdy%7D%7Bdx%7D%3D%5Clim_%7B%5Cdelta+x+%5Cto+0%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Clog_b%28x%2B%5Cdelta+x%29-%5Clog_b%28x%29%7D%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D+%3D%5Clog_b%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%2B%5Cdelta+x%7D%7Bx%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F%5Cdelta+x%7D+%3D%5Clog_b%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D%7Bx%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F%5Cdelta+x%7D+%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%3D%5Clog_b%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D%7Bx%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7Bx%2F%5Cdelta+x+%5Ctimes+1%2Fx%7D+%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D%5Clog_b%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D%7Bx%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7Bx%2F%5Cdelta+x%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now we can write ![\\tfrac{\\delta
x}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as some ![\\tfrac{1}{n}; \\therefore \\tfrac{x}{\\delta
x}=n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%3B+%5Ctherefore+%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%5Cdelta+x%7D%3Dn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
As ![\\delta x \\to 0, n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x+%5Cto+0%2C+n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can rewrite our limit as:

![\\displaystyle \\dfrac{d}{dx}y= \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}
\\dfrac{1}{x}\\log_b\\left(
1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cdfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdx%7Dy%3D+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D%5Clog_b%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We observe that this is the same limit we evaluated above. Now, if we
define
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the sum of the reciprocal of the factorials, which is the limit, and
set
![b=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![\\tfrac{d}{dx}\\log_e(x)=\\tfrac{1}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdx%7D%5Clog_e%28x%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be the natural base of logarithmic function and the derivative of
![\\log(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Conversely, the area under a unit rectangular hyperbola, i.e
![y=\\tfrac{1}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the logarithmic function with base
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Armed with
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we can next retrace certain developments in the history of early modern
mathematics. What is the relationship of an arbitrary exponential curve
![y=a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For this we need to first determine the derivative of
![a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is trivially done now that we have the derivative of
![\\log(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![y=a^x \\; \\therefore \\log(y)=x \\log(a)\\\\\[10pt\] \\dfrac{d

With this in hand we can see the relationship of any exponential curve
![y=a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2):  
![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Consider the family of exponential curves
![y=a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2; the red curve is
![y=e^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3De%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
From the above result we see that the tangent to a exponential curve
will have the slope
![m=\\log(a)a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Clog%28a%29a%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Let
![x=\\tfrac{1}{\\log(a)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog%28a%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then: ![m=\\log(a)a^{1/\\log(a)}=\\log(a)a^{\\log(e)/\\log(a)}=\\log(a)
a^{\\log_a(e)}=e\\log(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Clog%28a%29a%5E%7B1%2F%5Clog%28a%29%7D%3D%5Clog%28a%29a%5E%7B%5Clog%28e%29%2F%5Clog%28a%29%7D%3D%5Clog%28a%29+a%5E%7B%5Clog_a%28e%29%7D%3De%5Clog%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
A line passing through origin has the equation
![y=mx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dmx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We set
![m=e\\log(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3De%5Clog%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
when
![x=\\tfrac{1}{\\log(a)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog%28a%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the equation of the line yields
![y=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, the equation of the exponential curve yields
![y=a^{1/\\log(a)}=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da%5E%7B1%2F%5Clog%28a%29%7D%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the line
![y=e\\log(a)x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3De%5Clog%28a%29x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the tangent to
![y=a^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from origin.

![\\bullet](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbullet&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Thus, the tangent to an exponential curve from the origin will touch it
at a height of
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the
![X](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
at
![x=\\tfrac{1}{\\log(e)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clog%28e%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Given the derivative of the exponential function, it is obvious that the
derivative of
![e^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is
![e^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This in turn allows one to establish the relationship of any power of
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the reciprocal of factorials. Consider the infinite series:

![\\displaystyle \\textrm{f}(x)= \\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{x^n}{n!}=1+x+\\dfrac{x^2}{2}+\\dfrac{x^3}{3!}+\\dfrac{x^4}{4!}+...\\\\\[10pt\]\\\\
\\dfrac{d \\textrm{f}(x)}{dx} =
1+x+\\dfrac{x^2}{2}+\\dfrac{x^3}{3!}+...\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore
\\dfrac{d \\textrm{f}(x)}{dx} =
\\textrm{f}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ctextrm%7Bf%7D%28x%29%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D%3D1%2Bx%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E4%7D%7B4%21%7D%2B...%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D%5C%5C+%5Cdfrac%7Bd+%5Ctextrm%7Bf%7D%28x%29%7D%7Bdx%7D+%3D+1%2Bx%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E2%7D%7B2%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D%2B...%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%5Cdfrac%7Bd+%5Ctextrm%7Bf%7D%28x%29%7D%7Bdx%7D+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7Bf%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now the function whose derivative is the same as the function itself is
![e^x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Ex&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence,

![\\displaystyle e^x= \\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{x^n}{n!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+e%5Ex%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, this gives the relationship of a power of
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the reciprocal of factorials. If we put
![x=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the above we get the same infinite series for
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as we obtained from the above limit. With this in hand, we can arrive at
one of the most remarkable functions discovered in the history of early
modern mathematics that is key to our understanding of the universe.

In problem-2 we saw the magnitudes assumed by the combination function.
We see that they appear to define a bell-shaped curve (Figure 2, 3).
What is the curve that best approximates the binomial coefficients as
![n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3; shown for
![n=50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
For this we can begin by noting the following. It is a symmetric curve
around the central or the highest value binomial coefficients. It falls
sub-exponentially and is asymptotic to the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis.
Given this we can try to construct this basic shape with its maximum
centered on
![(0,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using an infinite series approach (Figure 4). Given that it is
symmetric, we only need to consider even powers of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in such a series.

[![bell_curve_expansion](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/bell_curve_expansion.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/bell_curve_expansion.png)Figure

We start with
![y=\\tfrac{x^0}{0!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E0%7D%7B0%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This in the least captures the maximum but little else. So the next term
corrects this by a subtraction to get a curve around the maximum; thus
![y=\\tfrac{x^0}{0!}-\\tfrac{x^2}{1!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E0%7D%7B0%21%7D-%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E2%7D%7B1%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, this correct falls straight down and we have to add a term to
get closer to the asymptotic behavior with respect to the
![X](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis.
Thus we get:
![y=\\tfrac{x^0}{0!}-\\tfrac{x^2}{1!}+\\tfrac{x^4}{2!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E0%7D%7B0%21%7D-%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E2%7D%7B1%21%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E4%7D%7B2%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We continue this process (first 8 steps are shown in Figure 4) and get
the infinite series:

![y=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{0}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{\\left(-x^2\\right)^n}{n!}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cleft%28-x%5E2%5Cright%29%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From the above series for a power of
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can immediately see that:

![y=e^{-x^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3De%5E%7B-x%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is the famous equation of the shape of the normal distribution,
which is a limit of the binomial distribution as ![n \\to
\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With this we can now provide the continuous approximation for the
combination function normalized by the maximal combination (Figure 3):

![y=e^{-(x-n/2)^2/(n/2)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3De%5E%7B-%28x-n%2F2%29%5E2%2F%28n%2F2%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus for the actual combination function we get:

![y={}^nC\_{n/2}e^{-(x-n/2)^2/(n/2)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%7B%7D%5EnC_%7Bn%2F2%7De%5E%7B-%28x-n%2F2%29%5E2%2F%28n%2F2%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

on combinatorics.

Let
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the number of the objects participating in the permutations without
replacement and
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be those objects, in this case digits. Given this, the problem
systematically takes you through several interesting questions:  
(i) The bheda-s, i.e. permutations:
![n!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For
![s=1..9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D1..9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is 362880.

\(ii\) The aṅka-mukha-s or aṅkāntya-s, i.e. number of permutations that
either begin or those that end in a particular digit: ![(n-1)!=
\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n-1%29%21%3D+%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is so because we keep one position constant and allow the remaining
to vary freely; thus,
![n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
positions are available for permutation. For ![s=
1..9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D+1..9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is 40320.

\(iii\) The ūrdhvāṅka-yoga, i.e. the sum of the numbers in a particular
column. ![\\Gamma(n) \\cdot \\sum
s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29+%5Ccdot+%5Csum+s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the above we saw that the number of permutations starting with a
particular digit is
![\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, for a given column, we will have that many permutations with each
digit. Thus, ![\\sum
s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum+s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
multiplied with
![\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will give us the sum for a given column. For ![s=
1..9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D+1..9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is 1814400

\(iv\) The sakalāṅka-yoga, i.e. the sum of all the numbers formed by the
digit permutations. ![\\Gamma(n) \\cdot \\sum s \\cdot (\\displaystyle
\\sum\_{k=0}^{n-1}
10^k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29+%5Ccdot+%5Csum+s+%5Ccdot+%28%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bn-1%7D+10%5Ek%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We have the expression for the sum of a column from above. Now, consider
a small example of the given problem with 3 digits. We can rewrite the
numbers formed by the permutations to keep the same total thus:

![\\begin{matrix} 1 \\quad 2 \\quad 3\\\\ 1 \\quad 3 \\quad 2\\\\ 2
\\quad 1 \\quad 3\\\\ 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 1\\\\ 3 \\quad 1 \\quad 2\\\\ 3
\\quad 2 \\quad 1\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\; \\to \\; \\begin{matrix} 1
\\quad 1 \\quad 1\\\\ 1 \\quad 1 \\quad 1\\\\ 2 \\quad 2 \\quad 2\\\\ 2
\\quad 2 \\quad 2\\\\ 3 \\quad 3 \\quad 3\\\\ 3 \\quad 3 \\quad 3\\\\
\\end{matrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bmatrix%7D+1+%5Cquad+2+%5Cquad+3%5C%5C+1+%5Cquad+3+%5Cquad+2%5C%5C+2+%5Cquad+1+%5Cquad+3%5C%5C+2+%5Cquad+3+%5Cquad+1%5C%5C+3+%5Cquad+1+%5Cquad+2%5C%5C+3+%5Cquad+2+%5Cquad+1%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bmatrix%7D+%5C%3B+%5Cto+%5C%3B+%5Cbegin%7Bmatrix%7D+1+%5Cquad+1+%5Cquad+1%5C%5C+1+%5Cquad+1+%5Cquad+1%5C%5C+2+%5Cquad+2+%5Cquad+2%5C%5C+2+%5Cquad+2+%5Cquad+2%5C%5C+3+%5Cquad+3+%5Cquad+3%5C%5C+3+%5Cquad+3+%5Cquad+3%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

As a result we can express the sum of all numbers formed by the
permutation of the digits to be the sum of a column multiplied by
![\\sum\_{k=0}^{n-1}
10^k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5E%7Bn-1%7D+10%5Ek&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
111 for the above example. Thus, for
![s=1..9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D1..9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![1814400 \\times 111111111=
201599999798400](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1814400+%5Ctimes+111111111%3D+201599999798400&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

\(v\) Finally, the aṅka-prapāta, i.e. the total number of digits in all
the permutations. ![n^2\\cdot
\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2%5Ccdot+%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Since there will be
![n!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
permutations and
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
starting digits it is easy to see that the total number of digits across
all permutations will be the above expression. For
![s=1..9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D1..9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is 3265920.

One would have noticed that we have used
![\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for
![(n-1)!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n-1%29%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
When Gauss studied the continuous form of the factorial function he
merely took it as
![x!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
however, the French mathematician Legendre defined it using
![\\Gamma(n)=(x-1)!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29%3D%28x-1%29%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We take the Legendre definition of the famous Gamma function as it
naturally emerges in solutions of problems such as that of Nārāyaṇa.
Indeed, this definition also naturally emerges from the famous integral
of Euler for
![\\Gamma(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that behaves just like the
![(n-1)!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n-1%29%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function. Being an integral this also gives the continuous form of the
![\\Gamma(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function specifying the value of the function for non-integer
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Euler’s integral:

![\\Gamma(x) = \\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty
t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28x%29+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+t%5E%7Bx-1%7De%5E%7B-t%7Ddt&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This integral can be handled using the rule for integration by parts:  
![\\int f(x) \\cdot g(x)dx = f(x) \\int g(x) dx - \\int f'(x) (\\int
g(x) dx)
dx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+f%28x%29+%5Ccdot+g%28x%29dx+%3D+f%28x%29+%5Cint+g%28x%29+dx+-+%5Cint+f%27%28x%29+%28%5Cint+g%28x%29+dx%29+dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Using
![f(x)=t^{x-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3Dt%5E%7Bx-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![g(x)=e^{-t}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28x%29%3De%5E%7B-t%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:

![\\Gamma(x) = t^{x-1} \\int e^{-t}dt - \\int (x-1) t^{x-2} (\\int
e^{-t}dt) dt \\\\\[7pt\] = -t^{x-1} e^{-t} + (x-1)\\int t^{x-2}e^{-t}
dt](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28x%29+%3D+t%5E%7Bx-1%7D+%5Cint+e%5E%7B-t%7Ddt+-+%5Cint+%28x-1%29+t%5E%7Bx-2%7D+%28%5Cint+e%5E%7B-t%7Ddt%29+dt+%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%3D+-t%5E%7Bx-1%7D+e%5E%7B-t%7D+%2B+%28x-1%29%5Cint+t%5E%7Bx-2%7De%5E%7B-t%7D+dt&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Taking the limits we get:

![\\Gamma(x) = \\displaystyle \\left. -t^{x-1} e^{-t}
\\right\\rvert\_{0}^{\\infty} + (x-1) \\int\_{0}^{\\infty} t^{x-2}e^{-t}
dt\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore \\Gamma(x) =
(x-1)\\Gamma(x-1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28x%29+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cleft.+-t%5E%7Bx-1%7D+e%5E%7B-t%7D+%5Cright%5Crvert_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%2B+%28x-1%29+%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+t%5E%7Bx-2%7De%5E%7B-t%7D+dt%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%5CGamma%28x%29+%3D+%28x-1%29%5CGamma%28x-1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By putting
![x=n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and doing the above repeatedly we get
![\\Gamma(n)=(n-1)(n-2)...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29%3D%28n-1%29%28n-2%29...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
until we reach 1 at which point the integral becomes:

![\\Gamma(n)=\\displaystyle (n-1)(n-2)..2 \\cdot 1 \\int\_{0}^{\\infty}
t^0 e^{-t} dt
=(n-1)!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%28n%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%28n-1%29%28n-2%29..2+%5Ccdot+1+%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+t%5E0+e%5E%7B-t%7D+dt+%3D%28n-1%29%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

In the final part of this note we shall consider the integer sequence
defined by the aṅka-prapāta: ![n^2\\cdot
\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2%5Ccdot+%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now let us do this for the sets of ![n=1, 2, 3,
4...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
permutable symbols. We get the integer sequence
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):  
**1, 4, 18, 96, 600, 4320, 35280, 322560, 3265920…**

This sequence has a notable property. It defines the number of integers
from
![1..k!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1..k%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that are not divisible by
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for ![k=2, 3,
4...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2%2C+3%2C+4...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Why this is so is easy to apprehend: Since we start from 2, we have
![k=n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Dn%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now the numbers that will be divisible by
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
between
![1..k!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1..k%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will amount to
![\\tfrac{k!}{k}=(k-1)!=n!](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bk%21%7D%7Bk%7D%3D%28k-1%29%21%3Dn%21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Therefore, the numbers that will not be divisible by
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will amount to ![(n+1)!-n!=n!(n+1)-n!=n (n-1)! (n+1-1)=n^2
\\Gamma(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%2B1%29%21-n%21%3Dn%21%28n%2B1%29-n%21%3Dn+%28n-1%29%21+%28n%2B1-1%29%3Dn%5E2+%5CGamma%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

If we take the sum of the reciprocals of this sequence we see that it
converges to a constant:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n^2 \\Gamma(n)} =
1.3179021514544...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E2+%5CGamma%28n%29%7D+%3D+1.3179021514544...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, what is this number? We discovered that this number emerges from
the solution of an interesting definite integral:

![\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 \\dfrac{e^x-1}{x} dx=
1.3179021514544...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint_0%5E1+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex-1%7D%7Bx%7D+dx%3D+1.3179021514544...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The integral can be split up as:

![\\displaystyle \\int \\dfrac{e^x}{x} dx - \\int \\dfrac{1}{x} dx=
\\int \\dfrac{e^x}{x} dx
-\\log(x)+C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex%7D%7Bx%7D+dx+-+%5Cint+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D+dx%3D+%5Cint+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex%7D%7Bx%7D+dx+-%5Clog%28x%29%2BC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

It is immediately apparent that the first integral ![\\int
\\dfrac{e^x}{x}
dx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex%7D%7Bx%7D+dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a tricky one: the function ![y=
\\dfrac{e^x}{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex%7D%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
diverges to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as ![x^+ \\to
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2B+%5Cto+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(from positive side) and to
![-\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as ![x^- \\to
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E-+%5Cto+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(from negative side). Remarkably, these opposite divergences cancel each
other and the integral converges to a fixed value. Thus we can evaluate
it to a given
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This function

is the exponential integral with deep connections with permutations. The

i.e.

is the Soldner-Ramanujan constant that was first discovered by Johann
von Soldner and independently by Ramanujan who arrived at it when he
discovered multiple series for the logarithmic integral
![\\textrm{Li}(x)=\\int_0^x
\\tfrac{dx}{\\log(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29%3D%5Cint_0%5Ex+%5Ctfrac%7Bdx%7D%7B%5Clog%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 5), which Gauss had shown to provide the asymptotic description
of the distribution of prime numbers. The famed ![\\textrm{Li}(x) =
\\textrm{Ei}(\\log(x))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28%5Clog%28x%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Returning, to our original integral we can thus write its indefinite
solution as:

![\\displaystyle \\int \\dfrac{e^x-1}{x} dx= \\textrm{Ei}(x) -\\log(x)
+C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex-1%7D%7Bx%7D+dx%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29+-%5Clog%28x%29+%2BC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now we observe that as ![x^+ \\to 0,\\; \\textrm{Ei}(x) \\to \\infty,\\;
\\log(x) \\to
-\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2B+%5Cto+0%2C%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%2C%5C%3B+%5Clog%28x%29+%5Cto+-%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(we only consider the approach to 0 from positive side for only there
the real
![\\log(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is defined). The two remarkably balance each other such that as ![x^+
\\to
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%2B+%5Cto+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the above integral converges to
![\\gamma=0.577215664...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%3D0.577215664...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is the famous Euler-Mascheroni constant with a deep connection to
the Gamma function (See below). Thus, the definite integral (Figure 5):

![\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 \\dfrac{e^x-1}{x} dx=
\\textrm{Ei}(1)-\\gamma=1.3179021514544...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cint_0%5E1+%5Cdfrac%7Be%5Ex-1%7D%7Bx%7D+dx%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%281%29-%5Cgamma%3D1.3179021514544...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This leads us to the formula:

![\\textrm{Ei}(1)=\\displaystyle \\gamma + \\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{1}{n^2\\Gamma(n)} =
1.89511781635...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%281%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cgamma+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E2%5CGamma%28n%29%7D+%3D+1.89511781635...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From this and the above indefinite integral we can obtain the general
formula for
![\\textrm{Ei}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:

![\\textrm{Ei}(x)=\\displaystyle \\gamma +\\log(x) +
\\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{x^n}{n^2\\Gamma(n)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cgamma+%2B%5Clog%28x%29+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5En%7D%7Bn%5E2%5CGamma%28n%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If we now substitute
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by
![\\log(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the series for the logarithmic integral as:

![\\textrm{Li}(x)=\\displaystyle \\gamma +\\log(\\log(x)) +
\\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{\\log^n(x)}{n^2\\Gamma(n)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cgamma+%2B%5Clog%28%5Clog%28x%29%29+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Clog%5En%28x%29%7D%7Bn%5E2%5CGamma%28n%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This was the series for
![\\textrm{Li}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that Ramanujan arrived at unaware of work of Gauss, Soldner and their
successors in Europe. He then went on to discover other series that
converged even faster to
![\\textrm{Li}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With these relationships one can finally obtain a relationship between
the mysterious Euler-Mascheroni constant
![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that appears in various formulae pertaining to both the number world and
the natural world and the Soldner-Ramanujan constant
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of number theory. Since
![\\textrm{Ei}(x)=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![x=\\log(\\mu)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Clog%28%5Cmu%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by substituting this into the above series for
![\\textrm{Ei}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BEi%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get:

![\\gamma = -\\Gamma'(1) =\\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}\\left(
\\sum\_{k=1}^{n}\\dfrac{1}{k} -\\log(n) \\right) = -\\log(\\log(\\mu)) -
\\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{\\log^n(\\mu)}{n^2\\Gamma(n)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+-%5CGamma%27%281%29+%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D%5Cleft%28+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D+-%5Clog%28n%29+%5Cright%29+%3D+-%5Clog%28%5Clog%28%5Cmu%29%29+-+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Clog%5En%28%5Cmu%29%7D%7Bn%5E2%5CGamma%28n%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The first expression
![\\Gamma'(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CGamma%27%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the derivative of the Gamma function. The second expression is
Euler’s original definition of
![\\gamma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as a limit. The third is what we obtain from the above substitution,
which gives it in relationship to
![\\mu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as derived from Ramanujan’s series.

Thus, in the works of the last great mathematicians of the Hindu
tradition like Bhāskara-II, Nārāyaṇa and Mādhava we see the preamble to
the developments of modern mathematics, which revealed the deep links
between the number world and the natural world. Nārāyaṇa’s interest in
combinatorics, sequences and sums may be compared with that of Euler.
Armed with a photographic memory and an enormous capacity for numerical
calculations, Euler was much like a paṇḍita of yore. Indeed, he dealt
with infinite sums and definite integrals almost like a continuation of
that old tradition. But among the Hindus it was Ramanujan, who close to
600 years after Nārāyaṇa and Mādhava nearly seemed as if he was
channeling them to single-handedly take their tradition to a conclusion.

The medical Suśruta-saṃhitā, kalpasthāna, chapter 3 contains an unusual
mythologem about the origin of poison. It clearly belongs to the
Prājāpatya tradition and presents some unusual features. It presented in
full below:

prajām imām ātma-yoner brahmaṇaḥ sṛjataḥ kila \|  
akarod asuro vighnaṃ kaiṭabho nāma darpitaḥ ॥  
tasya kruddhasya vai vaktrād brahmaṇas tejaso nidheḥ ।  
krodho vigrahavān bhūtvā nipapāta+atidāruṇaḥ ॥  
sa taṃ dadāha garjantam antakābhaṃ mahābalam ।  
tato ‘suraṃ ghātayitvā tat tejo ‘vardhata+adbhutam ॥  
tato viṣādo devānām abhavat taṃ nirīkṣya vai ।  
viṣāda-jananatvāc ca viṣam ity abhidhīyate ॥  
tataḥ sṛṣṭvā prajāḥ śeṣaṃ tadā taṃ krodham īśvaraḥ ।  
vinyastavān sa bhūteṣu sthāvareṣu careṣu ca ॥  
yathā ‘vyakta-rasaṃ toyam antarikṣān mahīgatam ।  
teṣu teṣu pradeśeṣu rasaṃ taṃ taṃ niyacchati ॥  
evam eva viṣaṃ yad-yad dravyaṃ vyāpyāv avatiṣṭhate ।  
svabhāvād eva taṃ tasya rasaṃ samanuvartate ॥

All these beings were emitted from his own womb by Brahman formerly. The
arrogant demon Kaiṭabha created an impediment \[for this task\]. Indeed
\[on being obstructed\], the fiery splendor of his wrath emerged from
Brahman’s face. His anger having taken an embodied form rushed out with
utmost ferocity. It burnt down that roaring, death-like mighty
\[demon\]. After having slain the demon, that fiery splendor \[of the
wrath\] grew most awfully. Seeing it, there arose consternation among
the gods. Having arisen from consternation (viṣāda) it was known as
poison (viṣa). Thus, having emitted his progeny in entirety, the lord
(Brahman) thereafter placed the toxin in the organisms, mobile and
immobile. Just as the atmospheric water with no taste on falling to
earth acquires the flavors of whichever places \[it falls at\], so also
the toxin by nature takes up the properties of the substances it
associates with.

We shall use this myth as a foundation to discuss to the following
points:  
1) Here the demon Kaiṭabha is seen independently of his usual partner
Madhu. Moreover, he is killed by the embodied wrath of Brahman rather
than by Viṣṇu as in the paurāṇika records that have come down to us. Is
this an unusual fossilization in a medical text of an old Prājāpatya
tradition where Prajāpati killed Kaiṭabha by himself, which was then
appropriated for Viṣṇu by his special votaries, or was it taken from
Viṣṇu for Prajāpati by Brahma-sādhāka-s? It is tempting to propose the
former due to the brāhmaṇa-like form of the narrative with a
“folk-etymology” for viṣa, the ascendancy of Prajāpati in the late Vedic
and epic period, which are coeval with the earliest layers of the two
great medical saṃhitā-s, and a resemblance to some epic Prājāpatya
narratives. For example, in the Mahābhārata Brahman creates seductive
women to commit to lust men, who are on the path of becoming gods by
observing dharma. However, the closest to this is the narrative of the
origin of Mṛtyu seen in the Drōṇaparvan (Mbh 7.49; insert with respect
to the Pune edition). It is said to have been narrated by Nārada to king
Akampana in the Kṛtayuga when his son Hari, who is said to have had the
splendor or Indra or Viṣṇu, died in battle:

Formerly, when Brahman emitted the creatures of the original creation
they were immortal. As he worried about this, the wrath of Brahman
manifested as a fire which filled the world and started consuming the
organisms. Then Rudra, the lord the ghosts, who was born of Brahman,
approached him and falling at his feet beseeched him not to destroy the
diverse families of organisms he had created and sustained with such
care. Hence, Rudra asked him to take back the fire. Brahman responded
that he did not wish to destroy them but their growth and absence of
death was weighing on the earth greatly and distressing it. But Rudra
continued to press on Brahman, mentioning that the fiery substance he
had emitted was emerging in a volcanic fashion blasting rocks, boiling
rivers and destroying all vegetation and asked him the boon of
controlling his destructive process. Brahman relented and did so. Then
from his sensory apertures there emerged a dark woman wearing red
clothes with a red tongue and eyes and ornamented with blazing earrings.
She traversed the space and went towards the south. She was Mṛtyu.
Brahman commanded her to be the death of all beings. On hearing that she
began to cry with a melodious wail. Brahman caught her tears in his
palms. She told Brahman that being female she did not want to join the
god Yama and perform the cruel deed of destruction of life. She the went
to various holy spots and performed tapasya with a sole focus on the god
Brahman. Pleased with her tapasya Brahman asked her what she wanted. She
told him that she had no desire to slay the creatures as they did not
even inflict the slightest harm on each other. She wanted to boon from
him of not having to perform the sinful acts of killing them.

Brahman then assured her that he along with all the other gods would
confer on her the boon of being perfectly free of sin, eternally
unsullied in her reputation. He told her that Yama the god of the South
and the diseases would aid her in her task and commanded her to bring
death to the four (why 4?) categories of organisms. She in return asked
Brahman that the organisms be seized by tendencies like greed, anger,
jealousy, malice, betray and delusion. Brahman granted that wish and
said that the organisms would without restraint pierce the bodies of
each other in manifold ways with utmost harshness (ahrīś cānyonyaparuṣā
dehaṃ bhindyuḥ pṛthagvidhāḥ ।). He then bade Mṛtyu to kill the organisms
without fear of sin. He assured her by saying that her tears which he
had collected in his palms would become diseases that would arise from
the bodies of the organisms themselves. Thus, when a man is killed by a
disease sin would not stick to Mṛtyu. Nārada concluded his sermon by
stating that it is not Mṛtyu with her rod who brought death to organisms
but it was disease and conflict between themselves.

But before concluding, Nārada utters a remarkable verse which we shall
take a detour to examine:

vāyur bhīmo bhīmanādo mahaujā  
bhettā dehān prāṇināṃ sarvago ‘sau ।  
naivāvṛttiṃ nānuvṛttiṃ kadā cit  
prāpnoty ugro ‘nantatejā viśiṣṭaḥ ॥  
That terrible Vāyu, roaring dreadfully, of great energy, and going
everywhere will shatter the bodies of living beings. The fierce \[Vāyu\]
of endless energy neither attains restraint nor retreats in this matter.

At first sight, this verse is somewhat unusual given that the entire
narrative does not mentioned Vāyu elsewhere. But it clearly appears to
preserve an old concept regarding the bringer of death that goes back to
the Indo-Iranian tradition. As we saw before, the gods Vāyu and
Prajāpati (Brahman) have deep connection with roots in that tradition.
Hence, the sudden introduction of Vāyu should not be seen as entire
surprising. Importantly, this is the one clear Indo-Aryan reference to
the death-bringing Vāyu, who also appears in the Iranian tradition as
bone-breaking Asto-Astovidhātu and the “pitiless Vāyu (vayaosh
anamarezhdikahe)” in the text known as the Aogemadaeca. The Aogemadaeca,
termed by the Iranian ritualist Dastur Jamaspji as a treatise that
“inculcates a sort of serene resignation to death”, covers themes
relating to death quite like this narrative of Nārada from the Mbh. It
has a series of incantations to Vāyu, which like in Nārada’s verse,
states that there is no means to escape the way of Vāyu.

2\) The legend of Madhu and Kaiṭabha also plays an important role in the
origin mythology of the early Pañcarātra-vaiṣṇava tradition (the
doctrine of the five nights). This is laid out in the Śānti-parvan of
the Mahābhārata (12.335 in the Pune edition) in the context of the
manifestation of Viṣṇu as Hayagrīva. As per the account the legend of
this manifestation was narrated after that of the dual Nara-Nārāyaṇa and
Varāha manifestations. Thus, these three are the primary vibhava-s of
Viṣṇu beyond his four vyūha-s that are central to the Pañcarātra
doctrine.

This narrative of Madhu and Kaiṭabha begins with an account of the end
and re-emergence of the universe as per early Pāñcarātrika-sāṃkhya-yoga.
Its is stated that all physical bodies are made up of the five primal
substances born of the buddhi of the Īśvara who is none other than the
great god Nārāyaṇa. At the end of universe, the solid substance merges
into the liquid substance and the result is a vast liquid expanse known
as the Ekārṇava. Then the liquid substance is absorbed into the heat and
light substance. That in turn is absorbed into the gaseous substance and
that is absorbed into vacuum. Vacuum is then absorbed into the universal
mind, the manas. The manas is absorbed into vyakta and the vyakta in
turn is absorbed into avyakta. The avyakta is absorbed into the puruṣa
and the puruṣa is finally absorbed into the “final state”. Then there is
only complete darkness or nothingness.

In that nothingness the brahma (neuter) manifests bearing in it the
potential of natural law. That brahma then manifests as a puruṣa termed
the Aniruddha (the generator vyūha of Pañcarātra) with the triple
guṇa-s. He is equivalent to the pradhāna of Sāṃkhya and possessed of
knowledge \[of manifesting the universe\] he is also known as the
Viṣvaksena. The Aniruddha generating a realm of primal fluid rests upon
it in yoga-nidrā. In that state he contemplates the creation of the
wondrous universe with diverse properties and in the process reflects on
his on great qualities. This self-consciousness (ahamkāra) results in a
blazing 1000-petaled lotus emerging from the Aniruddha and from that
lotus emerged the great 4-faced god Brahman also known as Hiraṇyagarbha
or the golden egg. Brahman taking his Parameṣṭhin form he began planning
the emission of the universe.

Just then two drops of fluid from the sea of primal fluid had fallen on
the lotus of Brahman. When Nārāyaṇa looked at them, one of them full of
pure Tamas became a demon Madhu. The other made of pure Rajas became
Kaiṭabha. Holding maces in their hands they began roving in the pistil
of the great lotus. Just then Brahman was commencing creation, starting
with the Veda-s. Madhu and Kaiṭabha forcibly took the Veda-s away from
him and dived into the primal ocean. Alarmed Brahman alerted Viṣṇu
stating that the Veda-s were his eyes and without them he would not be
able to create the universe. He then praised Viṣṇu with a hymn that
recalled his 7 births from the different parts of the body of Viṣṇu.

Hearing this, Viṣṇu assumed the form of the macranthropic Hayaśiras with
his body comprised of the entire universe. He began reciting the Veda
loudly. Hearing this, the two daitya-s threw the Veda-s in the nether
regions of the universal ocean and proceeded to see what was happening.
As the did so, Hayaśiras dived into the great ocean and retrieved the
Veda-s and returned them to Brahman. Not finding anyone the two daitya-s
returned to the spot where they had cast the Veda-s only to find them
missing. Wonder who had taken them away they rushed to the lotus from
which they had first emerged. There they saw the white Aniruddha
stretched in yoga-nidrā on the great snake, surrounded by a great circle
of flames. They began to laugh loudly and, stating that he was the
person who had retrieved the Veda-s, wondered aloud who that being was,
desiring to battle him. This awakened the god, who taking on his
Aśvaśiras form fought and slew both Madhu and Kaiṭabha. Thus, having
restored the Veda to Brahman and having slain the obstructing demons
Viṣṇu vanished letting Brahman to proceed with his act of creation. The
krama of worship this god Hayaśiras was acquired by the Pāñcāla monarch
from Rāma (the Bhārgava).

Thus, in this early Pāñcarātrika account the agent of Kaiṭabha’s
destruction is Viṣṇu in his Hayagrīva form. However, here he is coupled
with Madhu who only occurs in the Vaiṣṇava reflex of the myth. However,
here too, obstructions to Brahman’s act of creation are central to the
myth. This raises the possibility that there were two parallel versions
of the myth: one among the Prājāpatya-s centered on Kaiṭabha as in the
account of Suśruta and another among the Vaiṣṇava-s centered on Madhu,
with the Vaiṣṇava-s subsequently acquiring Kaiṭabha for their focal
deity. We see a further transformation at work in the later śākta
tradition (e.g. Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa) where the role of arousing Viṣṇu to
kill the two daitya-s is attributed to Mahākālī who herself is the
Yoga-nidrā of Viṣṇu. Again, in later Vaiṣṇava tradition Hayagrīva gets
decoupled from the Madhu-Kaiṭabha episode, though his role in retrieving
the Veda is retained.

We may conclude this point by noting that the arthropod bites which form
the backdrop of the section containing the above myth in Suśruta-s
medical saṃhitā make subliminal return in later kāvya. For example,
Māgha in his Śiśupāla-vadha states:

matkuṇāv iva purā pariplavau sindhunātha-śayane niṣeduṣaḥ ।  
gacchataḥ sma madhu-kaiṭabhau vibhor yasya naidra-sukha-vighnatāṃ kṣaṇam
॥  
Formerly, swimming like bugs Madhu and Kaiṭabha had proceeded to afflict
the lord of the ocean in his bed. They interrupted the pleasure of the
god’s sleep but just for a moment.

Bed bugs do not swim actively. But water-bugs are great swimmers and the
bite of some like the water bug *Notonecta glauca* can inflict pain.
This would then indicate that Māgha understood the water bugs to be of
the same category as bed bugs.

3\) Returning to the myth with which we started, we may note that beyond
Brahman there is another god with a much more natural connection to
poison. Right from the śruti we see that connection with the god Rudra.
In the Ṛgveda we notice him drinking poison from a cup along with the
Muni-s (RV 10.136.7). In the Atharvan, we have an incantation imploring
Rudra not to strike down the ritualist with poxes or poison or the
heavenly fire (AV-vulgate 11.2.26). In the Yajurveda, Rudra is termed
Nīlagrīva alluding to his neck turning blue from drinking poison. This
is elaborated in the paurāṇika tradition as happening during the
churning of the world-ocean during which the poison known as halāhala or
kālakūṭa arose distressing the deva-s and the asura-s. Rudra stepped
forward to drink it. In the Pañcaviṃśa-brāhmaṇa of the Sāmaveda we have
an account of Rudra smearing the plants with poison in particular years
resulting in death of the livestock (PB 6.9):

viṣeṇa vai tāṃ samām oṣadhayo ‘ktā bhavanti yāṃ samāṃ mahādevaḥ paśūn

Indeed the plants becomes smeared with poison in that year in which
Mahādeva kills the livestock. By uttering the incantation “Auspicious
\[be\] the king of the plants \[Rudra\]” he makes the herbs fit for
consumption. He makes consumable both types \[of herbs\] those which
ripen without cultivation and those which are cultivated.

This is probably an allusion to the years when plants producing toxins
in response to grazers grown in the pastures or when outbreaks of
diseases like anthrax occur. Even more apposite to our legend, is a
similar account from the Maitrāyanī-saṃhitā of the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda with
regard to the Prājāpatya-samidh (fire-stick) offered in the Agnihotra
ritual. This is placed in the context of Prajāpati creating the
organisms: after Prajāpati had emitted the organisms (beginning of MS
1.8.4) Rudra smeared the plants with poison (end of same section)
resulting in them not being eaten by Rudra:

oṣadhīr vā imā rudrā viṣeṇāñjaṃs tāḥ paśavo nāliśanta te devāḥ
prajāpatim evopādhāvan sa prajāpatir abravīd vāryaṃ vṛṇai bhāgo me ‘stv
iti vṛṇīṣvety abruvant so ‘bravīn maddevatyaiva samidasad iti tasmāt
prājāpatyā samid deveṣu hy asyaiṣā vāryavṛtā dve samidhau kārye dve hy
āhutī ekaiva kāryaiko hi prajāpatir ekadhā khalu vai samiddha uta bahvīr
āhutayo hūyante tā agninānvavākarot tā asvadayat tāḥ punarṇavā
ajāyantaitarhi khalu vā agnihotriṇe darśapūrṇamāsine sarvā oṣadhayaḥ
svadante yat samidham ādadhāti sarvā evāsmā oṣadhīḥ svadhayām akaḥ ॥  
These plants being smeared with poison by Rudra (unusual MS saṃdhi) were
not eaten by the animals. As the deva-s then ran to Prajāpati, he,
Prajāpati, chose a boon: “May there be a \[ritual\] share for me”. \[The
gods said\] choose. He \[P\] said: “May the fire-stick be \[offered\]
with me as the deity.” Therefore the Prājāpatya fire-stick \[is
offered\], for it was boon chosen from the gods by him. Should there be
two fire-sticks in the ritual as there are two offerings? One indeed is
the ritual action \[offering the fire-stick\] for Prajāpati is verily
one. Thus, just one fold is the offering of the fire stick even though
many oblations \[of ghee\] are offered. Those \[plants\] are
successively strewn by Agni. They were made palatable. They were born
anew again. Now indeed, when the ritualist who performs Agnihotra or the
New- and Full-moon rituals offers \[Prajāpati’s\] fire-stick all plants
become consumable. He has made all plants consumable for him.

A very similar brāhmaṇa passage for the single Prajāpati fire-stick in
the Agnihotra is presented in the Kaṭha-saṃhitā 6.5.53.11 and here too
Prajāpati relieves the toxin of Rudra in the plants by letting loose
Agni on them. This might be an allusion to the burning of pastures
contaminated by disease or filled with toxin-producing herbage. (As an
aside, the corresponding brāhmaṇa of the Taittirīyaka-s TB 2.1.3.7
onward does not mention Rudra or Prajāpati or the plants. It simply
mentions the single fire stick as being offered to Agni.)

Finally, we may note that several brāhmaṇa texts see Rudra as being born
from Prajāpati even as in the above-stated legend regarding the origin
of Mṛtyu from the Mbh. In the Kauśītaki brāhmaṇa (KB 6.1-9) he is born
from Prajāpati with a 1000 eyes bearing a 1000 arrows with an 8-fold
form (aṣṭamūrti). In the Śatapatha brāhmaṇa (ŚB 6.1.3.8-18) he is born
again from Prajāpati in an eight-fold form and then is joined with his
9th form Kumāra. In the Maitrāyaṇī-śruti (MS 4.2.12) he is born from
sweat of Prajāpati combined with that of the three realms first
generated by Prajāpati: Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya. Here, we are told that
Bhava and Śarva are the dreadful names of the god; hence, one should not
take them while making the offerings, instead once should take his
pacified names Rudra and Paśupati. But most tellingly for the myth with
which we started we can see a connection to an account of the birth of
Rudra in the Śatapatha brāhmaṇa 9.1.1.6 mentioned in the context of the
great Śatarudrīya offerings to the 100-headed Rudra upon completion of
the piling of the altar for the Soma ritual:

yadv evaitac catarudriyaṃ juhoti । prajāpater visrastād devatā
udakrāmaṃs tam eka eva devo nājahān manyur eva so ‘tinn antar-vitato
‘tiṣṭhat so ‘rodīt tasya yāny aśrūṇi prāskandaṃs tāny asmin manyau
pratyatiṣṭhant sa eva śataśīrṣā rudraḥ samabhavat sahasrākṣaḥ śateṣudhir
atha yā anyā vipruṣo ‘pataṃs tā asaṃkhyātā sahasrāṇi+imāṃ lokān
anuprāviśaṃs tad yad ruditāt samad rudrāḥ so ‘yaṃ śataśīrṣā rudraḥ
sahasrākṣaḥ śateṣudhir adhijyadhanvā pratihitāyī bhīṣayamāṇo ‘tiṣṭhad
annam icamānas tasmād devā abibhayuḥ ॥

As to why one makes this Śatarudrīya offering: When Prajāpati had
decayed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not leave him,
Manyu (wrath): extended he remained stationed within. He (P) cried.
\[By\] Whichever of his \[P’s\] tears that dropped down and settled on
Manyu, he \[M\] became the hundred-headed Rudra, with a thousand-eyes
and a hundred-quivers. Then the other drops that fell down, entered all
these worlds in innumerable thousands; inasmuch as they originated from
crying (rud), they were called Rudra-s. That hundred-headed Rudra with a
thousand-eyes and a hundred-quivers, with his bow strung, and his arrow
fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food.
Therefore gods were afraid of him.

To appease the 100-headed Rudra and his thousands of followers, the
other Rudra-s, the ritualist makes the 425 oblations to Rudra-s as
specified in the Yajurveda. (As an aside, one may note that this dread
of Rudra, even among the gods, is an old Indo-European sentiment: One
may compare it to his Greek cognate Apollo entering the hall of the gods
with his bow in the Homeric hymn to that god.)

Thus, in this narrative of the ŚB, Rudra is born of the wrath of
Prajāpati. Hence, lurking behind the mysterious embodied wrath of
Brahman, which became the poison of Suśruta, we suspect that there is an
implicit allusion to none other than Rudra, whose wrath elsewhere in the
medical saṃhitā-s is seen as the originator of diseases.

Over the years we have observed or encountered certain natural phenomena
that are characterized by rare, sudden eruptive behavior occurring
against a background of very low amplitude fluctuations. We first
encountered this in astronomy: most remarkably, in the constellation of
Corona Borealis there are two stars that exhibit this kind of behavior
albeit in opposite directions. There is T Coronae Borealis, which for
most part remains fluctuating rather dimly in a narrow magnitude band
between 9.9 and 10.6, well below naked eye visibility, and then once in
a century or so (e.g. in 1866 and 1946) explosively blazes forth at
magnitude of 2-3 ( ![\\approx 1000
\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1000+%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
brighter) changing the shape of the visible constellation. On the other
side, we have the equally charismatic R Coronae Borealis, which for most
part very mildly fluctuates around the magnitude of 6 at barely naked
eye visibility and then suddenly once in several years suddenly drops to
the magnitude of 14 or lower ( ![\\approx 1500
\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1500+%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
dimmer), beyond the reach of even a typical amateur telescope.

It has become increasingly clear that versions of such behaviors are
observed across the domains of science. In biology, recent studies in
foraging behavior have shown that diverse animals follow a pattern of
foraging movements, which are characterized by routine small movements
punctuated by the rare large movements. This kind of behavior allows the
escaping of local resource limitations by episodic saltations to reach
distant resource-rich regions. An unrelated phenomenon, earthquakes,
also displays similar behavior, where small low-magnitude tremors are
punctuated by rare episodes of major earthquakes with noticeable
effects. This might also be seen in sociology/geopolitics where long
periods of low intensity conflicts are interrupted by the rare cases of
major warfare. The world wars could be seen as such manifestations
against a background of low intensity conflict. This is relevant to the
clash between the thinkers Taleb and Pinker regarding whether there is a
real trend of the world having become more peaceful or not.

One of the great mathematicians of our age Benoît Mandelbrot provided a
framework to understand these disparate phenomena under the rubric of
random walks. He called a regular random walk, where the step sizes are
normally distributed, as the Rayleigh flights. In contrast, if they
instead show some distribution that has a tail with a slower than
exponential decay then he defined them as Lévy flights after the
mathematician Lévy. One example, of this is the so called Cauchy flight
which results from the steps of the walk showing the famous Cauchy
distribution (originally discovered by Poisson but attributed to
Cauchy). Such random walks are characterized by typical steps that are
smaller in magnitude more common than the typical steps under a normal
distribution and the extreme steps are rarer than under a normal
distribution but way more in magnitude than one would see under a normal
distribution. Thus, they capture the eruptive behavior quite well.

We have been long interested in creating simple mathematical analogies
for such behaviors observed in nature. Given that a random walk can be
reduced to its simplest form, i.e. a one dimensional change in
magnitude, we have been interested in one-dimensional maps that can
display such behaviors. We describe below a class of one-dimensional
maps, which we discovered, that show such a behavior. They are all
related to quadratic roots known as metallic ratios.

**The metallic ratios and generating functions of the metallic
sequences**  
Metallic ratios can be defined as irrationals which are produced by the
following formula:

![m_n=\\dfrac{\\left(n+\\sqrt{n^2+4}\\right)}{2}; n =1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cleft%28n%2B%5Csqrt%7Bn%5E2%2B4%7D%5Cright%29%7D%7B2%7D%3B+n+%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

They are called “metallic” after the smallest of them, the famous Golden
ratio. As we have noted before the first few metallic ratios are
“interesting” because they appear in various unrelated contexts but the
larger ones do not seem to do so.
![m_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and its conjugate
![m_n'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are root of a quadratic equation of the form:

![x^2 \\pm nx
-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%5Cpm+nx+-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The two roots are opposite in sign but correspond to ![m_n,
m_n'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%2C+m_n%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which show the relationship:

![m_n'=\\dfrac{1}{m_n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%27%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bm_n%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Accordingly, they count among the the so-called Pisot-Vijayaraghavan
numbers. We use
![m_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the larger and
![m_n'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the smaller root in absolute magnitude. Below are the first few
metallic ratios, which may assigned special symbols as below:

![bouncer_table1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bouncer_table1.png)

They are called ratios because they are the convergents of integer
sequences which are specified by the rule:

![f\[n\]=k \\cdot f\[n-1\]+f\[n-2\]; k=1, 2, 3...; f\[1\]=1,
f\[2\]=f\[1\]+k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Dk+%5Ccdot+f%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D%3B+k%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...%3B+f%5B1%5D%3D1%2C+f%5B2%5D%3Df%5B1%5D%2Bk&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
With
![k=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…**  
With
![k=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get: **1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99…**  
With
![k=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get: **1, 4, 13, 43, 142, 469…**  
With
![k=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get: **1, 5, 21, 89, 377, 1597…**

Notably these sequences are related to the quadratics whose roots they
are via certain generating functions. For a function
![y=f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Df%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the series expansion of
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at the value of
![x=a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Da&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is given by:

![y=f(a)+\\dfrac{f'(a)(x-a)}{1!}+\\dfrac{f''(a)(x-a)^2}{2!}+\\dfrac{f'''(a)(x-a)^3}{3!}....+\\dfrac{f^n{'}(a)(x-a)^n}{n!}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Df%28a%29%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bf%27%28a%29%28x-a%29%7D%7B1%21%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bf%27%27%28a%29%28x-a%29%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bf%27%27%27%28a%29%28x-a%29%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D....%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bf%5En%7B%27%7D%28a%29%28x-a%29%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, for instance, consider the function:

![y=\\dfrac{x}{x^2+x-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx%7D%7Bx%5E2%2Bx-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
its series expansion becomes:

![y= -(x + x^2 + 2 x^3 + 3 x^4 + 5 x^5 +
8x^5...)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D+-%28x+%2B+x%5E2+%2B+2+x%5E3+%2B+3+x%5E4+%2B+5+x%5E5+%2B+8x%5E5...%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We notice that the coefficients of the expansion polynomial are ![1, 1,
2, 3, 5,
8...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+5%2C+8...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, this expansion becomes the generating function of the Golden
sequence. Similarly, if we take:

![y=\\dfrac{2x-1}{x^2+3x-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x-1%7D%7Bx%5E2%2B3x-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the series expansion:

![y=1 + x + 4x^2 + 13x^3 + 43x^4 +
142x^5...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D1+%2B+x+%2B+4x%5E2+%2B+13x%5E3+%2B+43x%5E4+%2B+142x%5E5...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here, the coefficients of the expansion polynomial correspond to the
Bronze sequence. The functions of the above type are tripartite curves
with two parallel asymptotes at
![x=-m_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D-m_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x=m_n'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Dm_n%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 1). The central branch of the curve is bounded between these
parallel asymptotes. The left and the right hyperbolic branches are
bounded respectively on the right and left sides by the two asymptotes.

**One dimensional maps based on the metallic sequence generating
functions**  
The above type of functions specify our one-dimensional maps. The maps
operate by using the well-known cobweb construction used in the study of
chaotic maps (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows the process for
![y=f(x)=\\tfrac{2x+1}{x^2+x-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Df%28x%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7B2x%2B1%7D%7Bx%5E2%2Bx-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which has the series expansion at
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as ![y=-(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 7 x^3 + 11 x^4
+18x^5+29x^6...)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-%281+%2B+3x+%2B+4x%5E2+%2B+7+x%5E3+%2B+11+x%5E4+%2B18x%5E5%2B29x%5E6...%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The convergent of the coefficients of this expansion polynomial is the
Golden ratio. We start with an initial point
![X_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then project the point on the the curve
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
defined by one such metallic sequence generating function to obtain
point
![Y_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then project
![Y_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
on the line
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to obtain point
![X_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then repeat the above procedure with
![X_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The resulting projection segments are plotted as a cobweb diagram
(Figure 1). In algebraic terms the map is expressed as
![x\_{n+1}=f(x_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Df%28x_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Our empirical examination revealed that not all maps of this type
produce interesting behavior — they simply converge to a single fixed
attractor value. Moreover, we did not observe interesting behavior with
other small quadratic Pisot-Vijayaraghavan roots, e.g.: ![x^2-3x+1=0; x=
1+\\phi,
1-\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-3x%2B1%3D0%3B+x%3D+1%2B%5Cphi%2C+1-%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or ![x^2-2x-2; x=1\\pm
\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-2x-2%3B+x%3D1%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

In our exploration we found the following maps to show interesting
behaviors.

![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2+x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2Bx_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One point to note regarding these maps is the high degree of numerical
instability of most of them. Hence, we have to use high precision
numbers to study the evolution of a starting value under the map. We
found that one needs a precision of 1500 bits in order to obtain a
proper evolutionary trajectory for 20000 iterations of the map. The
investigations discussed below are with this precision and number of
iterations. Evolution under these maps can be classified into 4 distinct
types and we shall discuss examples of each of the distinct types of
behaviors in greater detail below.

**Type-1: Chaotic and eruptive behavior**  
The archetypal member of this type is Golden-ratio-based map:  
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2x_n+1}{x_n^2+x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x_n%2B1%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2Bx_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Figure 2 shows the evolution of
![x_0=\\tfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
under this map. It is immediately apparent that it is characterized by
predominantly low amplitude movements interrupted by rare episodes of
extreme eruptions that can be several orders of magnitude of the typical
values. A feel for this can be obtained via the below table.

![\\begin{tabular}{\|l\|c\|} \\hline Quantile & Value \\\\ \\hline

We observe that
![75\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=75%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
ot the values are in rather narrow band of ![\\pm
2.41](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+2.41&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
however, the extremes are roughly 2500-15000 times greater than that
band. Thus, we see what is plainly eruptive behavior. It is also rather
obvious from these values that the distribution of the values attained
under this map are dramatically different from a normal distribution
with comparable dispersion. The rarity and the magnitude of the extreme
values results in the mean being greatly different from the median.

To get a better look at the nature of the movements as
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
evolves under this map we plot the same on the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale (Figure 3). The central blue line corresponds to
![0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It is flanked on either side by two red lines which correspond to ![\\pm
0.2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+0.2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In this case ![\\approx
12.5\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+12.5%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
lie in this band. The green lines correspond to the Golden ratios
![\\phi',
-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27%2C+-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The cases where ![x_n \\ge
100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n+%5Cge+100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is
![0.64\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.64%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the values, are marked with red points. We observe that:  
1) The evolution of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
follows a chaotic course.  
2) The eruptions are triggered in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
approaches ![\\phi',
-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27%2C+-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Blue points in figure 3). This is illustrated at greater magnification
in Figure 4. The reason for this is rather obvious from the equation of
the map — if ![x_n=\\phi',
-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3D%5Cphi%27%2C+-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will explode to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
thus, closer
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gets to
![\\phi',-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27%2C-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
greater is the eruption in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If the value of ![x_n\>\\phi',
-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3E%5Cphi%27%2C+-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when approaching it then the eruption in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will positive, if
![x_n\<\\phi',\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3C%5Cphi%27%2C%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the eruption will be negative.

[![Golden_bouncer3_Fig4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig4.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig4.png)Figure

3\) Because the map tends to mostly produce small absolute values
![\\approx 50\\%\\; x_n \\in \\pm
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+50%5C%25%5C%3B+x_n+%5Cin+%5Cpm+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is obvious that the smaller root
![\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triggers more eruptions than
![-\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) From Figure 4 one also observes a peculiar motif in the form of runs
of relatively low amplitude fluctuations in the vicinity of ![\\phi,
\\tfrac{-\\phi'}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B-%5Cphi%27%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(marked as dark green horizontal lines).

Because of the rather dramatic dispersion of the values of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we studied their distribution in the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale (Figure 5).

[![Golden_bouncer3_Fig5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig5.png)Figure
5.

We observe that the distribution is symmetric about 0, as we would
expect from the above quantile distributions of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The blue curve shows an attempt to fit a Cauchy distribution to the
observed frequencies. We see that it does not capture the distribution
too well. The more general form of such a distribution, the
t-distribution, also does not perfectly capture the observed
frequencies. However, taking inspiration from that we were able to
derive a curve that fits the histogram better than any of these
distributions. It is defined by a shape function with 4 parameters ![a,
b, r,
s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+r%2C+s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the form (red curve in Figure 5):

![y=\\dfrac{1}{1+a\|x\|^r+b\|x\|^s}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2Ba%7Cx%7C%5Er%2Bb%7Cx%7C%5Es%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Another map belonging to this type is similar one based on the Silver
ratio (Figure 6):  
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2x_n+1}{x_n^2+2x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x_n%2B1%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B2x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

6.

It displays the same type of chaotic movements as the above map with
episodes of major eruptions.

[![Silver_bouncer2_Fig7](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/silver_bouncer2_fig7.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/silver_bouncer2_fig7.png)Figure
7.

The zoom in Figure 7 shows that the eruptions in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are in this triggered by
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
approaching the Silver ratio and its conjugate (light green lines). Like
the above map, here too there are motifs comprised of short runs of low
amplitude oscillations around two values: ![4-2\\sqrt{2},
-1+\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4-2%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%2C+-1%2B%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 7).

**Type-2: low amplitude oscillations punctuated with destabilization and
eruptions**  
The maps exhibiting the second type of behavior are:

![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2+x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2Bx_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2-x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2-x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2+2x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B2x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);

![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2+3x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B3x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2x_n+1}{x_n^2+3x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x_n%2B1%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B3x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{x_n}{x_n^2+4x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx_n%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B4x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

[![bouncers3_Fig8](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bouncers3_fig8.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bouncers3_fig8.png)Figure
8.

Figure 8 shows examples of the evolution of the same
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
under three of these maps based on the Golden, Silver and Bronze ratios.
At first sight the eruptions are comparable to what we saw in the Type-1
maps — they are rare episodes and huge in magnitude relative to the rest
of the movements under the map. However, these maps are distinct, in
that other than the larger magnitude instability just before major
eruptions the background movements are not even registered. To get a
better look at what is happening we plot one of the examples (the map
based on the Golden ratio) in the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale (Figure 9).

[![Golden_bouncer2_Fig9](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer2_fig9.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer2_fig9.png)Figure
9.

Here we can see that, as in the Type-1 maps, the eruptions are triggered
when
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
passes close to ![-\\phi',
\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cphi%27%2C+%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(blue points in Figure 9 prior to the red points marking the eruptions
greater than 100). But quite strikingly, even in the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale, the background movements under the map are barely visible. Hence,
we zoom in on a particular region of the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale plot (Figure 10).

[![Golden_bouncer2_Fig10](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer2_fig10.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer2_fig10.png)Figure
10.

Only here we observe that the map is for most part characterized by a
very quiet behavior, which, unlike the Type-1 maps, takes the form of
regular low-amplitude oscillations that asymptotically build up till
they near one of the Golden ratio roots at which point they show
unstable behavior leading to an eruption. After a major eruption the
evolution settles in a very low amplitude oscillation as seen in the
right part of Figure 10. Accordingly we get a paradoxical distribution
of
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
values on the
![\\mathrm{arcsinh(x)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%28x%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale with a very sharp peak and a heavy tail Fig 11. This distribution
might also be described by some form the shape equation specified in the
above type.

[![Golden_bouncer3_Fig11](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig11.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/golden_bouncer3_fig11.png)Figure
11.

These maps may also be used to describe a feature common to all these
maps, i.e. extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions (Figure 12,
13). Even a difference of
![10^{-8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the starting
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
results in completely different evolutionary trajectories. This is why
we need to use extremely high precision numbers to get numerical stable
evolution: e.g. 450-600 decimal digits.

[![bronze_bouncer_Fig12](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bronze_bouncer_fig12.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bronze_bouncer_fig12.png)Figure

An example based on the Bronze ratio.

13.

An example based on the Silver ratio. The second example illustrates how
eruptive behavior can return after an extremely long phase of
quiescence.

**Type-3: Convergent root-seeking behavior after eruptions and
instability**  
This is an interesting behavior prototyped by the Bronze ratio-based
map:  
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2x_n-1}{x_n^2+3x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x_n-1%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B3x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here, the map tends to show oscillatory behavior with occasional
eruptions as in the above type. However, after 1 or a few eruptions
associated with some chaotic instability the map settles to a fixed
behavior where it cycles between a small set of values that gradually
converge to roots of a certain polynomial equation (Figure 14, 15).

In this case after 2 large eruptions within the first 400 iterations it
eventually converges to cycling between the three roots of the equation:

![P_1: y=x^3-3x+1; \\;
\\overbrace{x_1=2\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{18}\\right) \\rightarrow
x_2=-2\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{9}\\right) \\rightarrow
x_3=2\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi}{9}\\right)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1%3A+y%3Dx%5E3-3x%2B1%3B+%5C%3B+%5Coverbrace%7Bx_1%3D2%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B18%7D%5Cright%29+%5Crightarrow+x_2%3D-2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B9%7D%5Cright%29+%5Crightarrow+x_3%3D2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B9%7D%5Cright%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here too, we notice that the eruption occur in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(red dots) when ![x_n \\approx \\beta',

(blue dots close to blue lines), i.e. the bronze ratios. The map makes
multiple attempts to settle into cycling between the roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(brown horizontal lines) but each time slips away nears either
![-\\beta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cbeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and then erupts. Between 600 and 700 iterations the map settles into
what seems a permanent cycling between the roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and by 800 iterations approaches within
![10^-6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E-6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of those roots. Iteration of the map for an additional 100000 iterations
showed no further eruptive behavior suggesting final convergence to the
roots; however, we have not been able to prove this is indeed case.

In this case the map makes multiple attempts to cycle between the roots
of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the roots of a second polynomial
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
before finally converging to cycling between the roots of the latter
(brown horizontal lines):

There is one obvious static
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which remains unchanged under this map, namely the real root of the
equation:
![x^3+3x^2-3x+1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2B3x%5E2-3x%2B1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![x_s =
-1-2^{1/3}-2^{2/3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s+%3D+-1-2%5E%7B1%2F3%7D-2%5E%7B2%2F3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is exactly this
![x_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then it will return itself under the map. Even a point very close to
![x_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is unstable and will not remain there for too long, eventually
converging to
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, a
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that was identical to
![x_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
till 600 places after the decimal point slid away from
![x_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by iteration 705 of map and within the next 20 iterations was on its way
to converge to the roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, all other points under this map eventually converge to either the
roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or of
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 16).

The

in steps of .025. The red
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converge to roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
while the green
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converge to roots of

The roots of

are marked by blue vertical lines and those of
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by orange lines. Notably, it seems that they converge to
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
less often than
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such the ratio
![P_2:P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2%3AP_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
appears to converge to
![\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(is there a way to formally test this conjecture?). Interestingly,
immediately below ![P_2:
x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2%3A+x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
there is a region where every
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converges to
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
There is a pseudo-symmetric region above ![P_2:
-x_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2%3A+-x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where they all converge to
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Overall, this convergence plot shows a strange pseudo-symmetry in terms
of the iterations to convergence required by
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 16).

These roots show some interesting properties:  
![P_1: x_1+x_2+x_3=0; \\; \\dfrac{1}{x_1}+x_2=1; \\;
\\dfrac{1}{x_2}+x_3=1;\\; x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot
x_3=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1%3A+x_1%2Bx_2%2Bx_3%3D0%3B+%5C%3B+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx_1%7D%2Bx_2%3D1%3B+%5C%3B+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx_2%7D%2Bx_3%3D1%3B%5C%3B+x_1+%5Ccdot+x_2+%5Ccdot+x_3%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Further, the roots of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are connected to an interesting three-seeded Nārāyaṇa-like sequence with
a subtraction rather than a sum:  
![f\[n\]=3f\[n-1\]-f\[n-3\];\\; f\[1\]=0, f\[2\]=1,
f\[3\]=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D3f%5Bn-1%5D-f%5Bn-3%5D%3B%5C%3B+f%5B1%5D%3D0%2C+f%5B2%5D%3D1%2C+f%5B3%5D%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This yields: **0, 1, 3, 9, 26, 75, 216, 622, 1791, 5157, 14849, 42756,
123111, 354484, 1020696, 2938977…**

The convergent of this sequence is
![1+2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{9}\\right)=1-x_2 \\approx

In principle, this could be used to construct approximations of a
regular nonagon. The terms of this series are provided by a generating
function which is reciprocal of
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Its series expansion at 0 is:

![\\dfrac{1}{x^3-3x+1}=1 + 3x + 9x^2 + 26x^3 + 75x^4 + 216x^5 + 622x^6 +

For the second polynomial we have:  
![P_2: x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=-7;\\; \\dfrac{1}{x_1}+\\dfrac{1}{x_3}=1; \\;
\\dfrac{1}{x_2}+\\dfrac{1}{x_4}=1; \\; x_1\\cdot x_2\\cdot x_3 \\cdot

These roots are similarly related to 2 sequences. The first is:  
![f\[n\]=7f\[n-1\]+6f\[n-2\]-2f\[n-3\]-f\[n-4\];\\; f\[1\]=-1, f\[2\]=0,
f\[3\]=1,

This yields: **-1, 0, 1, 2, 21, 157, 1220, 9438, 73051, 565388, 4375926,
33868270, 262129619, 2028799713, 15702263239, 121530513443…**

The convergent of this sequence is ![P_2: -x_2 \\approx

The second sequence is:  
![\\displaystyle f\[n\]=7f\[n-2\]+f\[\]n-1\]-\\sum\_{j=1}^{n-4} f\[j\]);

This yields: **-1, 0, 1, 2, 10, 25, 95, 268, 921, 2760, 9075, 27995,
90199, 282083, 900320, 2833750, 9004640…**

The convergent of this series is ![P_2: \\dfrac{1}{x_1} \\approx
3.165352](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2%3A+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx_1%7D+%5Capprox+3.165352&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Notably, the terms of this sequence can be produced using the reciprocal
of
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the generating function. Its series expansion at 0 is:

![\\dfrac{1}{x^4+7x^3-6x^2-2x+1}=1 + 2 x + 10 x^2 + 25 x^3 + 95 x^4 +
268 x^5 + 921 x^6 + 2760 x^7 + 9075 x^8 + 27995 x^9

Thus, this map function has a peculiar property with respect to the
roots of the polynomials
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in that applying it one root yields another in cyclic fashion. Given
that for both these polynomials there is a root close to
![\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
these can “capture” the
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
approaching it and drive them into a cycle. Thus, these might be seen as
stable examples of the motifs encountered in the Type-1 behavior.

**Type-4: Convergence to bounded bands after initial eruptions and
instability**  
This type of behavior is exhibited by the Copper ratio-based map:  
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2x_n-1}{x_n^2+4x_n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2x_n-1%7D%7Bx_n%5E2%2B4x_n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Evolution under this map has parallels to the Type-3 behavior. Like in
Type-3, after initial instability, which might include some eruptions
and chaotic fluctuations, the evolution under the map settles to cycling
between specific bounded bands. Within those bands it wanders
quasi-chaotically, i.e. with some discernible patterns, but never leaves
those bands. Number iterations taken by different
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to converge to cycling within those bands can vary greatly (Figure 17).

Here,
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are sampled in the interval
![(-40,40)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-40%2C40%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in steps of .01. The plot shows a pattern with zones of rapid
convergence interspersed with clusters of much longer convergence times.
When we zoom in on a region with a cluster of slowly converging
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we see that the number of iterations to converge to the band-cycle shows
a fractal pattern (Figure 18).

Here, the

at steps of .001. In both these cases a pseudo-symmetry similar to the
iterations-to-convergence plot for the Type-3 behavior (Figure 16) is
observed. Here too there is a static point ![x_s \\approx
-4.68577952...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s+%5Capprox+-4.68577952...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is the real root of
![x^3+4x^2-3x+1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2B4x%5E2-3x%2B1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
it returns itself under the map. Unless one is exactly at
![x_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which has a very complicated closed form, any other
![x_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the vicinity continues to converge to the band-cycle.

To examine this type of behavior more closely we consider the evolution
of
![x_0=4.37](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D4.37&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 19), which is particularly slowly converging in Figure 17. We
find that there is a massive eruption little after
![n=150](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D150&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(eruptions
![\>20](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3E20&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are marked with red points), which is lodged in the midst of generally
chaotic behavior which lasts till close to
![n=260](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D260&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(see lower panel in
![\\mathrm{arcsinh}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Barcsinh%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
scale). Not surprisingly, within this region, we observe that, as in the
previous types of behavior, the eruptions occur in
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(marked with blue points) approaches ![\\kappa',
-\\kappa](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa%27%2C+-%5Ckappa&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(marked with blue horizontal lines). However, the striking feature of
this type is that sometime after this region the map settles into a more
regular cycling behavior and never leaves it to degree we have tested
these maps
![(n=100000)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%3D100000%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We examine this cyclic behavior more closely in Figure 20.

[![band_convergence_points_Fig20](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/band_convergence_points_fig20.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/band_convergence_points_fig20.png)Figure

Here, we plot the evolution of
![x_0=4.37](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D4.37&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We find that the
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
falls in very specific bands:  
1) A very narrow middle band centered at
![\\frac{2}{5+\\sqrt{5}}\\approx
0.276393...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B5%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%5Capprox+0.276393...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 20, red points).

2\) A lower band bounded by ![\\left(-2 -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\approx
-3.118033, -2 -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\approx -2.447213
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28-2+-%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D%5Capprox+-3.118033%2C+-2+-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D+%5Capprox+-2.447213+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 20, violet points).

3\) An upper band bounded by ![\\left(\\sqrt{5}-1 \\approx 1.236067,
\\frac{20+4\\sqrt{5}}{15} \\approx
1.929618\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1+%5Capprox+1.236067%2C+%5Cfrac%7B20%2B4%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B15%7D+%5Capprox+1.929618%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 20, blue points).

In the state of convergence the map cycles from the middle band to the
upper to the lower band over 3 successive
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Beyond these bands, there are two lines:  
1) in the lower band corresponding to ![\\frac{2577-1221 \\sqrt{5}}{58}
\\approx
-2.6420517](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B2577-1221+%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B58%7D+%5Capprox+-2.6420517&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

2\) in the upper band corresponding to
![\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B5-%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

It is notable that the above band-bounds and lines are all related to
![\\sqrt{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is the surd in ![\\kappa,
\\kappa'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa%2C+%5Ckappa%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
They are indicated by horizontal lines in the plot. From the two lines
within the bands the points appear to alternately wander towards the
upper and lower bounds of the upper and lower bands. As the map evolves,
once they reach close the bounds the process repeats again starting from
those lines (Figure 20). Each round of wandering is largely symmetric
between the upper and lower bands but each round is different from the
previous one. In this, type as in Type-3 it appears that
![x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is captured into the band cycle as it approaches
![\\kappa'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is close to the central band defined by
![\\frac{2}{5+\\sqrt{5}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B5%2B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

**Tailpiece**  
There are several open questions (for us) regarding these
investigations. Is there a formal way of deriving which roots a map may
converge to if it shows a Type-3 behavior? Is there a way to formally
establish the bands of convergence for Type-4 behavior? Is there way to
say whether a map would go the way of Type-1 or Type-2 from its
equation?

Whatever the case, the maps discussed here are most remarkable because
they can produce complex behavior similar to that observed in natural
systems with very simple underlying equations. They illustrate cases of
long quiescence (Type-1 and Type-2) with eruptive behavior. These
behavior suggests that prolonged low amplitude oscillations or secular
changes do not guarantee the absence of sudden eruptions. This is
important in realizing that situations like prolonged peace do not mean
that there would no major catastrophic conflict. This suddenly emerges
as the system moves towards a superficially unremarkable low magnitude
state that in reality is something like the metallic ratio trigger seen
in these maps. Then we have the reverse behavior where after an initial
chaotic phase the map settles into a more regular behavior from which it
never emerges due to being captured by certain similarly superficially
unremarkable values (Type-3 and Type-4). In history we see that the
dramatic movements that occur early in a civilization are never
reproduced in the later stages from which it might be unable to break
out.

**The fruits of the elephants**  
nāgo bilvam ivākramya pothayiṣyāmy ahaṃ śiraḥ \|  
alabhyām icchatas tasya kīcakasya durātmanaḥ \|\|  
Like an elephant seizing a bilva \[fruit\] I will crush the head of that
evil Kīcaka who desires that which ought not to be attained.

This striking simile occurs in our national epic the Mahābhārata in the
words of the 2nd Pāṇḍava Bhīmasena to his wife. Herein, he promises to
strike her tormentor Kīcaka even as an elephant strikes a bilva fruit.
The bilva (*Aegle marmelos*) and similar-looking fruits greatly
fascinated us in our childhood (Figure 1). Among the other fruits that
appear to have convergently evolved a comparable structure are *Limonia
acidissima* which produces a fruit (commonly called the wood-apple) that
resembles the bilva in terms of its woody shell. Then in our youth we
ran into the elephant apple, *Dillenia indica*, in a great botanical
garden, which also produces a monstrous, hard fruit with parallels to
the above two. Such fruits with hard rinds which might need to be broken
by a hammer to access the pulp puzzled us — which animals other humans
(who are only recent feature of the Indian landmass) could deal with
such a formidable fruit. We then read as a youth of an account of humans
and elephants in conflict for this fruit in Northeastern India, which
has since then only intensified apparently resulting the killing of some
elephants.

[![elephant_fruits_small](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/elephant_fruits_small.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/elephant_fruits_small.png)Figure
1

It was shortly thereafter that we came across this remarkable simile
from the Mahābhārata. The kavi as a naturalist was likely recording a
real ecological observation via this simile. Suddenly everything became
clear in our minds: These cannonball-like fruits did not evolve for
human consumption at all in the first place but for a symbioses with
large herbivores, the foremost among which were the proboscideans.
Proboscideans enjoyed a widespread distribution in recent Cenozoic past
across India and probably played a major role in the dispersal of the
seeds of these plants. Their hard shells were an adaptation for
specifically being consumed by these animals thereby allowing their
seeds to be deposited far from the parent plant in their fertilizing
dung. So strong was the selection for such a mode of dispersal that we
have at least three independent cases of convergent evolution of
comparable fruit morphology among these Indian trees. One may also add
that the mango might have also benefited in the past from a similar
proboscidean dispersal.

The above woody fruits also made us curious about the mysterious
cannonball tree (*Couroupita guianensis*), which we encountered with
much excitement in our youth in a temple of Rudra in the Karṇāṭa
country. Indeed, its flowers are offered to Rudra, with its reproductive
whorls resembling a liṅga sheltered by a hooded serpent. The woody fruit
itself is quite reminiscent of the morphology of bilva or the
wood-apple. So it appeared to us that it was yet another case of
convergent evolution of such a fruit type. The only issue is that we
soon learned that it is not native to India but to Central and South
America. This got us wondering as to how and when it reached India.
Given that is called the nāgaliṅga or the śivaliṅga tree across both
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, and its wide usage in folk Indian
medicine, it appears that it might have even reached India in
pre-Columbian times. Thus, it might join a select band of mysterious
plants like the custard apple, the sunflower, datura and the maize that
made their way to India from the Americas in pre-Columbian times. How
exactly these made their way from the pre-Columbian Americas to India
remains a matter of debate to date.

India still has the elephant and has a deep and reasonable fossil record
of megafauna, some of which were truly gigantic even relative to the
modern Indian elephant: the extinct elephant *Palaeoloxodon
namadicus*was probably one of largest land mammals ever, which might
have grown up to 5.2 meters in height, and mysteriously became extinct
sometime after 24000 years before present when *Homo sapiens*was
already in the subcontinent. Therefore, the presence of several such
fruits primarily accessible to megafauna, like the elephants
(hereinafter colloquially used for proboscideans), is no surprise given
their long history in the region. However, we see no elephants in the
Americas; hence, the presence of fruits like those of the cannonball
tree puzzled us. This puzzle deepened when we first reached the shores
of Krauñcadvīpa and observed other such fruits such as the osage orange,
which would have been most suitable for giants like elephants. Moreover,
even other fruits like the avocado, which are today consumed by *Homo*,
seemed more apt for a megafaunal consumer. But this was a stark
contradiction for, unlike Africa or India, there are no megafaunae in
the Americas. This raised the question to as to what were these fruits
doing in the Americas?

**The American elephants**  
The answer to this is tied to remarkable history of the mammalian
megafauna of the Americas. We shall talk briefly about two distinct
lineages of those here. The elephants as afrotherians had their
provenance in the African landmass with some of the earliest members of
the clade, like *Moeritherium*being found in North Africa. There they
eventually radiated into at least 5 great lineages: the Deinotheriids,
Mammutids (mastodonts), Gomphotheriids, Stegodontids and Elephantids.
Between 18-22 million years ago multiple members of each lineage left
Africa and invaded Eurasia to colonize it in a big way. By around 16.5
Mya the Mammutid *Zygolophodon*invaded the North American continent via
the Bering strait. It was followed shortly thereafter by
*Gomphotherium*which was in North America by 15 Mya. They were followed
by likely multiple invasions of Stegodonts, with *Platybelodon*reaching
the New World around 13 Mya and *Amebelodon*by around 10 Mya. The
Elephantids were the last lineage to invade the New World with the
mammoth — an initial species *Mammuthus columbi*emerged in NA after 2.6
Mya and then within the last million years *Mammuthus
primigenius*followed. In the late Pleistocene, between 120000-13000 ya,
there were representatives of three major elephant lineages in NA
including, multiple mammoths of the Elephantid lineage, Mammut of the
Mammutid lineage and several gomphotheriids.

![elephants_png](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/elephants_png.png)Figure
2: The phylogeny of elephants according to Jeheskel Shoshani

Around 3 Mya the isthmus of Panama was complete connecting the North
American continent to the isolated South. This sparked the great
American biotic interchange, the main phase of which was between 2.7-1.8
Mya. During this period in the region corresponding to today’s Florida
to Honduras there were members of all three lineages, namely the
Mammutid *Mammut*, the Gomphotheriids *Cuvieronius*and *Stegomastodon*,
and the Elephantid *Mammuthus*. A little after 2 million years a
Gomphotheriid derived from the North American representative
*Rhynchotherium*entered South America. It subsequently spread
throughout South America and spawned 3 species, namely *Cuvieronius
hyodon*, *Notiomastodon platensis*, and *Haplomastodon waringi*. Thus,
until not very long ago there was an extensive elephant fauna across
both the Americas, which provided the opportunity for an extensive
co-evolution of certain fruit morphologies with them.

The evidence from the Arabian footprints suggests that the common
ancestor of the Gomphotheriid and Elephantid lineage already had
behaviors similar to those seen in extant elephants — matriarchal herds
and roving males with a more solitary behavior. It is conceivable that
such behaviors had already emerged even earlier prior to the divergence
of the Mammutids or the Deinotheriids. The elephants have large brains
and particularly well-developed temporal lobes. These features are
consistent with their complex behavior and learning capacity which go
hand-in-hand with their sociality. This, combined with their large size,
made them relatively safe from conventional predation pressures and
likely fueled their great march out of Africa that in the end spanned 5
continents and the entire range of ecosystems from wet-land forests, to
dry-lands, to the frozen Arctic. But this march that spanned over 20
million years suddenly came to a halt some time after about 1 Mya. A
wave of extinction of the elephants was seen first in the Old World and
sometime between 20000-7500 years before present in the New World. What
was the cause of this? While some ecologists like to blame climate
change, we hold that there is little doubt that things point to the hand
of *Homo*.

The roll-back of the elephants corresponds to the major expansion of
*Homo* beyond Africa. Indeed, elephants are seen at human feeding and
kill sites throughout this period. Notably, the last elephants of the
lineages that became extinct are seen in refugia where humans did not
initially reach: The remote Wrangel Island in the Arctic ocean had
Mammuthus until around 4000 YBP and these finally vanished around the
time *Homo* first settled on the island. Similarly, in SA the
gomphotheres persisted in refugia until around 8000-7500 YBP before
their complete extirpation by the paleo-South Americans. It is
conceivable that there was a faint memory of recently extinct elephants
in human tradition. For example, the Mahābhārata records [a giant
elephant-like
animal](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/upakatha-of-previous-sulapuru%e1%b9%a3a-catvarakam-2/)
in the legend of the brāhmaṇa in the pit. As a large species with a long
maturation time and a slow rate of reproduction, what was once a key to
their success became their Achilles heel when faced with a
super-predator like *Homo* who wiped out the reproductive adults before
they could be replaced. Thus, the empire of the giants came crashing to
the floor.

One may ask but what about the elephants of Africa and India? How did
they survive the assault of *Homo*. Some have offered the suggestion
that the long presence of *Homo* in these regions allowed
co-evolutionary responses that allowed them to cope with him. It is
possible that some behavioral adaptation of such a type exists – e.g.
aggressiveness towards *Homo*. However, as others have pointed out (e.g.
Surovell et al) that the more likely reason was that only the elephants
from forest environments, where sizable populations of *Homo* could not
be supported, made it past the slaughter. Indeed, while *Homo* branched
off from his closest cousins in a dense forest biome where they still
grimly hang on today, the rise of the predecessors of *Homo*
corresponded to his march into more open environments. Ironically, this
opening of African environments into mixed wood- and grass-land habitats
might have been triggered by the massive megafaunal expansion in the
Pliocene, which also marked the emergence of the lineage leading to
*Homo.* The work of O’Brien’s team using molecular data has shown that
the savanna elephants of Africa, i.e. *Loxodonta,* experienced a greater
population bottleneck than their forest counterparts, suggesting that
being in more open habitats they experienced the heavy hand of *Homo.*
Further, the extinction actually depended on the developments in the
intelligence and technology of *Homo.* For instance, when archaic *Homo*
first reached India he was probably not capable of completely wiping off
all elephants. But probably sometime around 50 Kya the sapiens species
of *Homo* was able develop hunting methods that allowed targeting of
accessible elephant species. This was evidently the cause for the end of
*Palaeoloxodon namadicus*by 24 Kya in India. Likewise, in the Americas
the spread of the Clovis hunters and their successors probably was the
key point in delivering the final blow to the elephants of the New
World. This has gone on to our times as newer weaponry comes into being
and newer races of *H.sapiens*reach places where they were previously
absent. This is what marked the demise of the cheetah and the near end
of the lion in Asia and the various faunae of Australia and New Zealand.
Now that *Homo’s* gun-hand can penetrate the forest with ease, the
remaining two species of elephants would also be wiped out in the
relatively near future in the absence of a directed conservation effort.

**The sloths and their demise**  
The elephants were a relatively late addition to the South American
landscape, coming in only after the completion of the Panaman isthmus.
South America had its own iconic megafaunae even when landmass was
isolated from the north. The fate of one of those indigenous components
of the fauna also paralleled that of the elephant-new-comers. These were
the xenarthrans, remarkable components of the uniquely South American
faunae, one of the great placental lineages, which included the sloths,
the anteaters, armadillos and glyptodonts. These were enormously
successful animals, which, during the great American biotic interchange,
were one of few lineages of Southern mammals that successfully made it
to and colonized the North. In fact, they were early movers, and reached
Central and North America even before the isthmus of Panama was
complete. On the other side they colonized the West Indies, with an
extensive presence in the Greater Antilles and Cuba. Once in the North,
they advanced further, with the Thomas Jefferson’s sloth (*Megalonyx
jeffersonii*) reaching Alaska. Indeed, they might have even made it all
the way to the Old World across Beringia had their world not come to an
abrupt end as we shall see below.

Today we have only two genera of sloths, the two-fingered sloths
(*Choloepus*) and the three-fingered sloths (*Bradypus*), small arboreal
forest mammals living in regions not easily accessible to humans. They
are a pale reminder of the once glorious radiation of the sloth clade of
xenarthrans that spanned a great diversity of behaviors and sizes. We
had the giant ground sloths like *Megatherium*that grew up to 6 meters
in length. We had marine Megatheriid sloths like *Thalassocnus*, which
progressively acquired aquatic adaptations and grew up to 3.3 meters in
length. Then there were ground sloths which modified the very landscape
of parts of Brazil and Argentina, where they dug up numerous burrows in
hard substrates ranging in diameter from 1.5 to 4 meters. While the
species which created them are not known, based on their size they could
have been the work of sloths like *Glossotherium*, *Scelidotherium*,
*Ocnotherium*or *Lestodon*. Further, they successfully survived the
arrival of competing Northern herbivores, like the elephants, and new
predators, like the cats and the bears, during the faunal interchange.
Notably, some giant sloths like *Eremotherium*often co-occur with
elephants after their arrival in South America suggesting that they had
partitioned into different niches in the same habitat, thereby
recreating a setting like the African bush.

![sloths_small](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/sloths_small.jpg)Figure
4. Sloths by Jorge Blanco

The relationships of these sloths were enigmatic until recently, but as
their demise was not so long ago it has been possible to use ancient DNA
and paleo-proteomic approaches to address the problem. Recently
published studies suggest an interesting evolutionary scenario for the
sloths, wherein the Caribbean sloths *Acratocnus ye*and *Parocnus
serus*form the basal-most lineage. The next to branch off was the clade
uniting the Mylodontids and the 2-fingered sloths. The third clade
includes all the Megatherioids and the 3-fingered sloths. Within it the
South American Megatheriids are the basal-most lineage. The North
American Megalonychids and Nothrotheriids form the immediate
sister-group of the 3-fingered sloths. This suggests that either the
arboreal adaptation evolved twice in the 2- and 3- fingered sloths or
that there was an ancestral arboreal tendency from which the ground
sloths repeatedly emerged. The latter is supported by the arboreal
tendencies observed in the West Indian sloths (Figure 4). Further, this
phylogeny also suggests that the sloths reached the West Indies via an
early land bridge long before the connection of the North and South
American continents.

**The survivors of the *Homo* Blitzkrieg**  
Strikingly, the end of the sloths closely paralleled that of the
elephants, which were only recent arrivals to the South. After an
enormously successful run that spanned tens of millions of years,
sometime around 10000 YBP, they all but completely vanished in the
continental Americas. Subsequently, around 4400 YBP they vanished
entirely in the West Indies. This pattern is telling as it parallels the
fate of the last of the extinct Elephantids on isolated islands, where
they vanished much after the mainland and typically only after humans
arrived. Like elephants, sloths such as *Megatherium americanum*too
have been found in butchery sites of *Homo* in the Americas from around
12600 YBP. There have been major climatic changes and concomitant
shrinkage of ranges, loss of habitats and background extinctions going
on all while before the origin of *Homo.* However, new species fill
those that are lost through convergent evolution or the old lineages
recover after a while. The pattern we observe here is nothing like that,
especially given that many of the lineages that vanished so dramatically
across continents had been successful in weathering the climatic changes
and background extinctions over tens of millions of years. Thus, despite
the fashionable statements among some ecologists and paleontologists
pinning everything on climate, we have to conclude that *Homo* squarely
stands accused.

All this happened with almost the suddenness of a mass extinction due to
astronomical causes, but, unlike in those cases, many of the plants once
adapted to the megafauna remain intact. Indeed, the ecologists Dan
Janzen and Paul Martin, who first noted these anomalies in their
brilliant paper “Neotropical Anachronisms: The Fruits the Gomphotheres
Ate” noted several examples from the New World of what might be remnants
of now lost adaptations of plants to megafauna. For example they propose
that large clusters of thorns of the legume known as the honey locust
tree might have been an adaptation against browsing by the now extinct
elephants. Some of them, like the avocado, which was once on the menu of
the great sloths, might have found a new partner in their extirpators,
i.e. *Homo.* Others have proposed that the osage orange might have
survived because some early Americans used the tree to make bows and
subsequently due to the horses brought by Europeans taking up the role
of their dispersers (see Barlow’s excellent popular account of the
same). Hence, one would predict that new megafaunae might arise again
once *Homo* himself goes the way of extinction.

**Śrīpati’s pearl necklace for Maheśvara**  
The brāhmaṇa Śrīpati of the Kāśyapa clan was a soothsayer from
Rohiṇīkhaṇḍa, which is in the modern Buldhana district of Maharashtra
state. Somewhere between 1030 to 1050 CE he composed several works on
mathematics, astronomy and divination, one of which is the Gaṇita-tilaka
on basic arithmetic and algebra which has come down to us through
incomplete manuscripts. In that he posses the following problem (The
solution is provided by his Jaina commentator Siṃhatilaka Sūri in 1275
CE):

viśva-kha-sapta-bhujaṅga-navārkāḥ śaila-turaṅga-samāhata-dehāḥ \|  
syāt sphuṭa-tāraka-vartula-muktā-bhūṣaṇam atra maheśvara-kaṇṭhe \|\|  
The bodies of all (13), the space (0), the seven (7), the snakes (8),
the nine (9) and the suns (12) struck together (means multiplied in
mathematical terminology) with the mountains (7) and the horses (7) may
now be the clear, sparkling and globular pearls forming an ornament for
the neck of Maheśvara.

The purpose of the problem is two-fold: (1) to make the student familiar
with using the Hindu numerical code (the bhūta-saṃkhya) and (2) make the
student do some elementary large number multiplication. Thus, the
problem is actually a simple multiplication ![12987013 \\times
77](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12987013+%5Ctimes+77&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
whose answer is
![1000000001](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1000000001&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Interestingly, Śrīpati offers a clue for the answer in the problem
itself: he says the multiplication of the 2 numbers results in a
necklace of clear, sparkling, spherical pearls for Maheśvara. This is
clearly an allusion to the palindromic structure of the product, with
the 0s forming the pearls, since they were written historically as
circles and the two flanking 1s form the bindings of the necklace. Some
numerical savants are known to exhibit a synesthesia with respect
numbers — perhaps such was indeed the situation with Śrīpati for a
palindromic number such as this could simultaneously produce in ones
mind the vivid image of a pearl necklace.

Moreover, this is not just any pearl necklace but one for Rudra’s neck.
It is in this regard we believe he encoded more into that number. As we
can see from the above, one of the factors of 1000000001 is 11, which is
the characteristic number of the Rudra-s. At the same time, the Rudra-s
are also said to be 1000s upon 1000s (Yajurveda: sahasrāṇi sahasraśo ye
rudrā adhi bhūmyām \|). Thus, this product captures both those aspects.
Further, the numbers that yield the product are described in
bhūta-saṃkhya (itself eminently amenable synesthetic experience of
numbers) as including viśvā (= all); kha (= space); 7, which symbolizes
the heavenly realms or vyāhṛti-s, the 8 directional earth-bearing
snakes, the 9, which symbolizes the planets, the 12 Āditya-s on one hand
and the 7 continental mountain ranges and 7 solar horses on the other.
Thus, the two numbers are described by the entities of entire universe
pervaded by the 1000s of Rudra-s with their 11-fold essence and their
product is seen yielding a necklace for Maheśvara. In this regard, the
use of viśva for 13 is curious. In the bhūta-saṃkhya system, viśva
represents the viśvedeva-s (all gods). In the gaṇapāṭha database from
which Pāṇini constructed his grammar we find viśvadeva as entry 13 in
the manojñādi-gaṇa (GP 177.13), thus lending viśva to encode 13.

**Maheśvara’s necklace sequence and its factors**  
Taking the cue from Śrīpati, we can define a general integer sequence
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of Maheśvara’s necklaces thusly:
![f\[n\]=10^n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D10%5En%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is an integer and
![f\[n\]^m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%5Em&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![m=1,2,3,4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D1%2C2%2C3%2C4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
is also palindromic. This implies that ![n=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Thus, the first few terms of our sequence are:  
**11, 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, 1000001, 10000001, 100000001,
1000000001, 10000000001…**

We can next ask what are the factors of each
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The first few
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are factorized and tabulated below:

Table
1[![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_table1.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_table1.png)

From the above one may notice a few obvious things. The first 2 terms of
the sequence are primes, 11 and 101, but all others are composites. It
is also obvious that 3 can never be a factor of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
because the sum of the digits of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will never be 3. We also observe that many of the
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
have a tendency to have a mix of small factors with a very large one.
Śrīpati’s original example
![f\[9\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B9%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is one such: ![f\[9\]=7\\times 11\\times 13\\times 19\\times
52579](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B9%5D%3D7%5Ctimes+11%5Ctimes+13%5Ctimes+19%5Ctimes+52579&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can then ask questions such as: 1) which primes will divide a given
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
2) For which
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will a given prime
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be a factor of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
3) Knowing these, we can ask questions, such as, at what further
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will we get a
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that will be again divisible by 52579, i.e. they will be further
Maheśvara’s necklaces of the type specified by Śrīpati.

We notice right away that 11 divides every other term, i.e. whenever
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is odd. We also notice that 101 is a factor of
![f\[2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and every 4th term thereafter. Thus, we can formally write that 11
divides every
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![n=2k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![k=0,1,2,3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0%2C1%2C2%2C3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, 101 divides every
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![n=4k+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4k%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, it also becomes obvious that 11 and 101 will never be co-factors
of the same
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With closer observation we can see that every prime
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that divides a subset of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
does so at some ![n=m\\cdot
k+\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3Dm%5Ccdot+k%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![m=2,4,6,8...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2%2C4%2C6%2C8...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
the reason for writing it this way will become clear below. The first
few
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that divide
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for some
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are tabulated in the order of how often they do so along with the form
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
takes when
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is divisible by that
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

Table
2[![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_table2.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_table2.png)

At first site the order in which the primes which divide
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
appear beyond 11 and 101 is puzzling — they wildly differ in magnitude
and form. However, a closer examination reveals a striking pattern
behind this: a prime
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
appears in the above list as per the [*multiplicative
order*](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/11/03/fermats-little-theorem-and-the-periods-of-the-reciprocals-of-primes/)
of 10 modulo
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
consider ![10^j \\mod
p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej+%5Cmod+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where ![j=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
when for the first time ![10^j \\mod p =
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej+%5Cmod+p+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
that
![j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the multiplicative order of ![10 \\mod
p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10+%5Cmod+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Carl Gauss had famously shown in his *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae* that
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the length of the repeat pattern of the decimal expansion of
![\\tfrac{1}{p}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bp%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, it is also clear that
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divides
![10^j-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the first time when
![j=m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3Dm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, for 7 we get
![m=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
because 7 divides
![10^j-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the first time when
![j=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to give
![\\tfrac{999999}{7}=142857](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B999999%7D%7B7%7D%3D142857&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Likewise, the repeat pattern in the decimal expansion of
![\\tfrac{1}{7}=0.\\overline{142857}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D%3D0.%5Coverline%7B142857%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is of length 6. From the above we can easily see why a
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will divide
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
first time when
![n=\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the sequence of
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that divide
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the first time will be arranged as per the multiplicative order of
![10 \\mod
p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10+%5Cmod+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

![10^m-1=
10^{(m/2)^2}-1=(10^{m/2}-1)(10^{m/2}+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Em-1%3D+10%5E%7B%28m%2F2%29%5E2%7D-1%3D%2810%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D-1%29%2810%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divides
![10^j-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the first time when
![j=m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3Dm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, it will not divide
![10^{m/2}-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, because
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divides
![10^m-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Em-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
it therefore divides
![10^{m/2}+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now what if
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divides some factor of
![10^{m/2}+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which takes the form ![10^j+1; j=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej%2B1%3B+j%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)?
We can see from polynomial factorization that a polynomial of the form
![x^j+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ej%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can frequently have two factors of the form ![x^j+1; j=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ej%2B1%3B+j%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
namely
![x+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![x^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example,
![x^3+1=(x+1)(x^2-x+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E3%2B1%3D%28x%2B1%29%28x%5E2-x%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![x^6+1=(x^2+1)(x^4-x^2+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E6%2B1%3D%28x%5E2%2B1%29%28x%5E4-x%5E2%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, in our case ![x+1 \\equiv
11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2B1+%5Cequiv+11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![x^2+1 \\equiv
101](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2B1+%5Cequiv+101&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Those are primes and the first two terms of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence, they will not be divided by any other
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, less frequently, other numbers of the form
![10^j+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are divisors of another such number for a larger
![j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, 10001 is a divisor of 1000000000001. So, let us assume for
a moment that
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divides some
![10^l+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5El%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is a factor of
![10^{m/2}+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7Bm%2F2%7D%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
then
![l\<\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3C%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
does divides
![10^l+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5El%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
then it also divides
![10^{2l}-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B2l%7D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
But
![2l-1\<m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2l-1%3Cm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence,
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cannot divide it because it will only divide a number of of the form
![10^j-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
when
![j=m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%3Dm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the multiplicative order of ![10 \\mod
p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10+%5Cmod+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cannot divide any other
![10^l+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5El%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![l\<\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3C%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

The Maheśvara’s necklaces
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are the sequence
![10^j+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5Ej%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
therefore they would be divided by a given
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the first time when
![n=\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which is half the multiplicative order of ![10 \\mod p
\\;\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10+%5Cmod+p+%5C%3B_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By the procedure we followed above we can see that, after
![n=\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would divide every
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where ![n=m\\cdot k+\\tfrac{m}{2}; k=1, 2,
3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3Dm%5Ccdot+k%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3B+k%3D1%2C+2%2C+3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
A corollary to this is only
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with even
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be factors of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for only then
![\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would be an integer. Hence, those primes with odd
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such as ![3,
m=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+m%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
![37,
m=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=37%2C+m%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
etc will never be factors of any
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Armed with the above, we can also tell which will be the next
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that will have 52579 as a factor as the original example of Śrīpati. For
52579, ![m=18 \\; \\therefore p \| f\[n\] \\iff n=18k+9; \\;
k=0,1,2...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D18+%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+p+%7C+f%5Bn%5D+%5Ciff+n%3D18k%2B9%3B+%5C%3B+k%3D0%2C1%2C2...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Hence, next term would be:  
![f\[27\]=1000000000000000000000000001](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B27%5D%3D1000000000000000000000000001&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can also see that some
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will always come together as factors of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
because they have the same
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, 7 and 13 with
![m=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or 19 and 52579 with
![m=18](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D18&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will always co-occur. Further, if a certain
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
satisfies the relationship ![n=m \\cdot k
+\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3Dm+%5Ccdot+k+%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a certain
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also divides that
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will occur again as a factor of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, consider ![n=6 \\times
3+3=21](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D6+%5Ctimes+3%2B3%3D21&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now,
![m=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
here; hence
![f\[21\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B21%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be divisible by both 7 and 13 as they have
![m=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, 7 divides 21. Hence, 7 will occur again as the factor of
![f\[21\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B21%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we have: ![f\[21\]= \\underline{7} \\times \\underline{7} \\times
11 \\times 13 \\times 127 \\times 2689 \\times 909091 \\times
459691](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B21%5D%3D+%5Cunderline%7B7%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cunderline%7B7%7D+%5Ctimes+11+%5Ctimes+13+%5Ctimes+127+%5Ctimes+2689+%5Ctimes+909091+%5Ctimes+459691&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Likewise, ![n=6 \\times 6
+3=39](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D6+%5Ctimes+6+%2B3%3D39&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will correspond to a
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
divisible by both 7 and 13. However, as 39 is divisible by 13, we will
have 13 occur again as a factor of
![f\[39\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B39%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![f\[39\]=7 \\times 11 \\times \\underline{13} \\times
\\underline{13} \\times 157 \\times 859 \\times 6397 \\times 216451
\\times 1058313049 \\times
388847808493](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B39%5D%3D7+%5Ctimes+11+%5Ctimes+%5Cunderline%7B13%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cunderline%7B13%7D+%5Ctimes+157+%5Ctimes+859+%5Ctimes+6397+%5Ctimes+216451+%5Ctimes+1058313049+%5Ctimes+388847808493&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
All other
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
would be square-free.

**The families of Maheśvara’s necklaces**

We can represent any given
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as a clique of its factors. For example, Figure 1 shows the dodecagonal
clique formed by the factors of
![f\[45\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B45%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which the most composite
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for
![n=1..50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1..50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then merge all cliques sharing common nodes for ![f\[n\],
n=1..50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%2C+n%3D1..50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The edges and the nodes are then scaled as per their frequency of
occurrence across all 50 cliques. The result is a factor graph for
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which is shown in Figure 2.

2 (click on figure to magnify)

We can see from Figure 2 that there are totally 6 families of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in this range. These families can be described according to their
founder member which is then the divisor of the remaining
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of that family. The founder member of each family can be described as
the
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the form ![10^{2^l}+1,
l=0,1,2...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B2%5El%7D%2B1%2C+l%3D0%2C1%2C2...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![2^l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5El&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponds to a particular
![\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):

● When ![l=0,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D0%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 11 family. 11, as we saw above, divides every
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to ![n=2k +
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2k+%2B+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, every
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to an odd
![\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is drawn into this family, there making it the largest of them.  
● When ![l=1,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D1%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 101 family. 101 draws all
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to
![n=4k+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4k%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus it becomes the largest of the even
![\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
families.  
● When ![l=2,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D2%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 1001 family. 1001 being composite is centered on its two
factors 73 and 137 and corresponds to the terms where
![n=8k+4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D8k%2B4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
● When ![l=3,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D3%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 100000001 family. This number being composite is centered on
its factors 17 and 5882353 and corresponds to the terms where
![n=16k+8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D16k%2B8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
● When ![l=4,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D4%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 10000000000000001 family centered on its factors 353, 449,
641, 1409 and 69857. This encompasses the terms corresponding to
![n=32k+16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D32k%2B16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
● When ![l=5,
\\tfrac{m}{2}=32](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%3D5%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D%3D32&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get the 100000000000000000000000000000001 family centered on its
factors 976193, 19841, 6187457 and 834427406578561. This includes the
terms corresponding to
![n=64k+32](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D64k%2B32&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Thus, we find that the even
![\\tfrac{m}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
terms are split up among the various families that appear as per the
powers of 2.

**The largest factor of Maheśvara’s necklace**  
Given the above information, we can cut down the time in which we
factorize Maheśvara’s necklaces and gather the set of factors for the
first 300 terms of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can then ask which is the largest prime
![p_m\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_m%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which divides the corresponding
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Figure 3 shows the plot of
![\\log\_{10}p_m\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog_%7B10%7Dp_m%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We see that the general increase of
![\\log\_{10}(p_m)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28p_m%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
appears to be linear with
![\\log\_{10}(f\[n\])](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28f%5Bn%5D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It is bounded between lines ![y=a_ux,
y=a_lx](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Da_ux%2C+y%3Da_lx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![a_u=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_u%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and ![a_l \\approx
0.1831](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_l+%5Capprox+0.1831&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The upper bounding slope
![a_u](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_u&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is easy to understand: as we observed above, some
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
tend to have factors widely differing in magnitude; thus the large one
is closer in magnitude to
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Trivially, first two terms are primes. There after we get
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that are minimally composite. These tend to be of a particular form,
e.g.:  
![f\[19\]=11 \\times
909090909090909091](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B19%5D%3D11+%5Ctimes+909090909090909091&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![f\[31\]= 11 \\times
909090909090909090909090909091](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B31%5D%3D+11+%5Ctimes+909090909090909090909090909091&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![f\[53\]= 11 \\times
9090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909091](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B53%5D%3D+11+%5Ctimes+9090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909091&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, these have factors that approach the upper bounding line.

The median value of ratio of
![p_m\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_m%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is approximately 0.5006. This indicates an even distribution with half
the number of
![p_m\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_m%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being greater than the
![\\sqrt{f\[n\]}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the other half being lesser than
![\\sqrt{f\[n\]}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

We understand the lower bound is less clearly. Is there a way to derive
it from theory alone? One can see that for
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
corresponding to multiples of 15 there is an increased propensity to be
close to the lower bound. This is in part expected from the
factorization of polynomial of the form
![x^n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5En%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a multiple of 15. For example, we can see that:

![x^{13}+1=(x + 1) (x^{12} - x^{11} + x^{10} - x^9 + x^8 - x^7 + x^6 -
x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1) \\\\\[5pt\] x^{14}+1=(x^2 + 1) (x^{12} -

x + 1) (x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1) (x^8 + x^7 - x^5 - x^4 - x^3 + x + 1)
\\\\ \[5pt\] x^{16}+1=x^{16} + 1 \\\\ \[5pt\] x^{17}+1=(x + 1) (x^{16} -

As one can see from the above example the polynomial where
![n=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
tends to have more factors than other polynomial adjacent to it. Thus,
these tend to be among highly composite
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence, they are more likely to have smaller
![p_m\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_m%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
than their neighbors.

**Tailpiece**  
Finally, let us look at some actual historical pearl ornaments of
Maheśvara. The below were likely ātmaliṅga-s of a medieval South Indian
ruler or a royal śaiva officiant.

[![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_fig4.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maheshvara_fig4.png)Figure
4

In this example we see the first term of Maheśvara necklace sequence. 11
is of course the characteristic number of the Rudra-s. If we wish to add
the bottom two pearls which belong to a different register we get 13
which is the next most frequent factor of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

5

In this example we get two sets of pearl ornamentation one with 17 and
another with 7. Both of these are factors of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
with 7 being the next most frequent and 17 the founder of a distinct
family. Of course there are other numbers with other symbolisms in these
ornaments.

**The coin-toss problem and Nārāyaṇa’s sequence**  
If you toss a fair coin
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
times how many of the possible result-sequences of tosses will not have
a successive run of 3 or more Heads? The same can be phrased as given
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
tosses of a fair coin, what is the probability of not getting 3 or more
successive Heads in the result-sequence. For a single toss
![(n=1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%3D1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have two result-sequences
![H,T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2CT&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
so we have 2 result-sequences with no run of 3 or more continuous Heads.
Let
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the number of tosses,
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the number of result-sequences satisfying the condition and
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the probability of its occurrence. This can be tabulated for the first
few coin tosses as below:

![\\begin{tabular}{\|l\|p{0.5\\linewidth}\|l\|l\|} \\hline n & All
result-sequences & f\[n\] & p\\\\ \\hline 1 & H,T & 2 & 1\\\\ 2 & HH,

Thus we get the sequence as
![f\[n\]=2,4,7,13...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D2%2C4%2C7%2C13...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from which we can compute the probability as
![p=\\tfrac{f\[n\]}{2^n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D%7B2%5En%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The question then arises at to whether there is a general formula for
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The answer to this comes from a class of sequences described by the
great Hindu scientist Nārāyaṇa paṇḍita in 1356 CE. In his Gaṇita-kaumudī
he provides the following (first brought to the wider public attention
in modern times by Paramand Singh in his famous article on such
sequences):

ekāṅkau vinyasya prathamaṃ  
tat saṃyutiṃ puro vilikhet \|  
utkramato ‘ntima-tulya-  
sthānāṅka-yutim puro vilikhet \|\|  
First placing 1 twice ![f\[1\]=1;
f\[2\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B1%5D%3D1%3B+f%5B2%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
write their sum ahead
![f\[3\]=f\[1\]+f\[2\]=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B3%5D%3Df%5B1%5D%2Bf%5B2%5D%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Write ahead of that, write the sum of numbers in reverse order \[and
in\] positions equal to the “terminal”
![(q)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28q%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

utkramato ‘ntima-tulya-  
sthāna-yutiṃ tat purastāc ca \|  
antima-tulya sthānābhave  
tat saṃyutiṃ purastāc ca \|\|  
evaṃ saika-samāsa-sthānā-sāmāsikīyaṃ syāt \|  
Write ahead of that, write the sum of numbers in reverse order \[and
in\] positions equal to the “terminal” (continue process). (This means:
If ![3 \\le n \\le
q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Cle+n+%5Cle+q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n-2\]...f\[2\]+f\[1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D...f%5B2%5D%2Bf%5B1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
In the absence of \[numbers in\] positions equal to the terminal write
in the front the sum of those \[in available places\] (This means if
![q\<n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3Cn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then
![f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n-2\]...f\[n-q\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D...f%5Bn-q%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
). Thus, the numbers till the position one more than \[the prior\] may
be known as the additive sequence ![(f\[1\], f\[2\]...f\[n-q\],
f\[n-q+1\]...f\[n\])](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28f%5B1%5D%2C+f%5B2%5D...f%5Bn-q%5D%2C+f%5Bn-q%2B1%5D...f%5Bn%5D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

One will note that if one takes
![q=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then we get the famous mātrā-meru sequence
![f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n-2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn-2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(known in the Occident as the Fibonacci sequence after Leonardo of
Pisa). Nārāyaṇa then goes on to provide a numerical example for this
class of additive sequences:  
udāharaṇam –  
samāse yatra sapta syur  
antimas trimitaḥ sakhe \|  
kīdṛśī tatra kathaya  
paṅktiḥ sāmāsikī drutam \|\|  
Now an example: Friend, if we have 7 in the sequence and 3 as the
“terminal”
![(q=3)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28q%3D3%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then quickly say what will be the additive sequence under consideration.

The sequence in consideration in modern form starting from 0 will be
![f\[n\]=f\[n-1\]+f\[n+2\]+f\[n-3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3Df%5Bn-1%5D%2Bf%5Bn%2B2%5D%2Bf%5Bn-3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
with the first three terms being 0,1,1 (in Nārāyaṇa’s reckoning they
will be 1,1,2): **0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274, 504, 927,
1705…** Thus, Nārāyaṇa’s numerical example from
![f\[3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
onwards gives us the solution to the coin toss problem. In modern times
this sequence has been given the name “Tribonacci”. With this, one can
see that the probability of the getting a result-sequence without 3 or
more continuous heads decays with
![2^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
asymptotically towards 0.

**The convergent of Nārāyaṇa’s sequence and problem of the triple
proportional partition of a segment**  
Consider the geometric problem: Partition a line segment
![\\overline{AD}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAD%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of length
![t_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in 3 parts ![t_1, t_2,
t_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1%2C+t_2%2C+t_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
such that ![\\tfrac{t_2}{t_1} =
\\tfrac{t_3}{t_2}=\\tfrac{t_4}{t_3}=\\tfrac{t_1+t_2+t_3}{t_3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bt_2%7D%7Bt_1%7D+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bt_3%7D%7Bt_2%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bt_4%7D%7Bt_3%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bt_1%2Bt_2%2Bt_3%7D%7Bt_3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can see that the above geometric process is equivalent to the
formulation of the above tryantima-sāmāsikā-paṅkti of Nārāyaṇa (Figure
1). This indicates that, at its limit, the convergent of the above
sequence of Nārāyaṇa,
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
will yield us the ratio in which the partition of the segment should be
performed. Thus, we have:

![\\tau= \\displaystyle \\lim\_{n \\to \\infty}\\dfrac{f\[n\]}{f\[n-1\]}
\\approx
1.8392867552141611325518525646532...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Cto+%5Cinfty%7D%5Cdfrac%7Bf%5Bn%5D%7D%7Bf%5Bn-1%5D%7D+%5Capprox+1.8392867552141611325518525646532...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This number, unlike the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the convergent of the mātrā-meru-paṅkti, cannot be constructed using a
straight edge and a compass. However, as we shall see below, it can be
easily constructed using two simply specified conics which can in turn
be constructed using the geometric mean theorem or other standard
methods (Figure 2).

1\) Draw the parabola specified by
![y=x^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

as the origin.  
2) Draw a unit rectangular hyperbola with center
![C_h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_h&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![(1,1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Therefore, its equation will be
![xy-x-y=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xy-x-y%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) The two conics will intersect at
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Drop a perpendicular from
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
to cut it at
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
![t_1=\\overline{CB}=\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1%3D%5Coverline%7BCB%7D%3D%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) Extend
![\\overline{CB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
by a unit to get point
![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
![\\overline{BA}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBA%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
5) Draw a circle with
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as center and
![\\overline{CB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as radius to cut the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
at
![X](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
6) Mark point
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
along
![\\overline{CB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at a unit distance from
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Join
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![X](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
7) Draw a perpendicular to
![\\overline{QX}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BQX%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at
![X](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It will cut the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-Axis
at point
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Join
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By the geometric mean theorem
![\\overline{CD}=\\tau^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCD%7D%3D%5Ctau%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

This gives us the required partition of
![\\overline{AD}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAD%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
into 3 segments each proportional to the other as
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
and
![\\overline{AD}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAD%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
proportional to the largest partition
![\\overline{CD}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCD%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
again as
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we have:

![\\tau=\\dfrac{\\tau^2+\\tau+1}{\\tau^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctau%5E2%2B%5Ctau%2B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Hence,
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the root of the cubic equation
![\\tau^3-\\tau^2-\\tau-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%5E3-%5Ctau%5E2-%5Ctau-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we see that the above construction is achieved by solving this
cubic via the intersection of the said parabola and hyperbola. This
cubic equation has only one real root which is
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can take the help of computer algebra to obtain the exact form of
this root as:

![\\tau=\\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(1+\\left(19-3\\sqrt{33}\\right)^{1/3}+\\left(19+3\\sqrt{33}\\right)^{1/3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cleft%281%2B%5Cleft%2819-3%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%2B%5Cleft%2819%2B3%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The other two roots are complex conjugates:

![\\tau'=\\dfrac{1}{3} - \\dfrac{(19 - 3 \\sqrt{33})^{1/3}- (19 + 3
\\sqrt{33})^{1/3}}{6} + i\\dfrac{ \\sqrt{3}(19 - 3
\\sqrt{33})^{1/3}-\\sqrt{3}(19 + 3 \\sqrt{33})^{1/3}}{6}\\\\\[7pt\]
\\overline{\\tau'}=\\dfrac{1}{3} - \\dfrac{(19 - 3 \\sqrt{33})^{1/3}-
(19 + 3 \\sqrt{33})^{1/3}}{6} - i\\dfrac{ \\sqrt{3}(19 - 3
\\sqrt{33})^{1/3}-\\sqrt{3}(19 + 3
\\sqrt{33})^{1/3}}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%27%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%2819+-+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D-+%2819+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%7D%7B6%7D+%2B+i%5Cdfrac%7B+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2819+-+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2819+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%7D%7B6%7D%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%5Coverline%7B%5Ctau%27%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%2819+-+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D-+%2819+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%7D%7B6%7D+-+i%5Cdfrac%7B+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2819+-+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2819+%2B+3+%5Csqrt%7B33%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Comparable to the situation with
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and its conjugate, these roots have a relationship of the form:

![\\tau=\\dfrac{1}{\\tau'
\\overline{\\tau'}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%27+%5Coverline%7B%5Ctau%27%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

There are also some other curious identities satisfied by
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
like:  
![\\dfrac{(1+\\tau)^2}{1+\\tau^2}=\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%281%2B%5Ctau%29%5E2%7D%7B1%2B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%3D%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

**The convergent of Nārāyaṇa’s sequence and Mādhava’s
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
series**  
The triple partitioning of a segment leads us to a geometric
construction that yields the relationship between
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3):

![\\pi=4\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau^2}\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D4%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Figure 3 provides a proof for this of a type the old Hindus termed the
upapatti or what in today’s mathematics is a proof without words (to our
knowledge never presented before). Nevertheless, for the geometrically
less-inclined we add a few words below to clarify this.

In Figure 3, one can see how
![\\angle{\\alpha}=\\arctan\\left(\\tfrac{1}{\\tau^2}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7B%5Calpha%7D%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It emerges once from the starting triply partitioned segment as
![\\angle{\\alpha}= \\arctan\\left (\\tfrac{\\tau}{\\tau^3}
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7B%5Calpha%7D%3D+%5Carctan%5Cleft+%28%5Ctfrac%7B%5Ctau%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E3%7D+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The construction creates segments ![t_1, t_2,
t_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1%2C+t_2%2C+t_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the proportion of
![1:\\tau:\\tau^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%3A%5Ctau%3A%5Ctau%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get the second occurrence of ![\\angle{\\alpha}=\\arctan\\left
(\\tfrac{t_1}{t_3}
\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7B%5Calpha%7D%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft+%28%5Ctfrac%7Bt_1%7D%7Bt_3%7D+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
That in turn implies the occurrence of a vertical segment of size
![\\tau^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the construction we also get ![\\angle{\\beta}=\\arctan\\left
(\\tfrac{t_3}{t_1+t_2+t_3}\\right)=\\arctan\\left
(\\tfrac{1}{\\tau}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7B%5Cbeta%7D%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft+%28%5Ctfrac%7Bt_3%7D%7Bt_1%2Bt_2%2Bt_3%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft+%28%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![\\angle{\\alpha}+\\angle{\\beta}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7B%5Calpha%7D%2B%5Cangle%7B%5Cbeta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
add up to form the congruent base angles of an isosceles right triangle
with congruent sides measuring
![\\tau+\\tau^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%2B%5Ctau%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This implies that:

![\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau^2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left
(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}\\right)= \\arctan(1)=\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}\\\\\[7pt\]
\\therefore
\\pi=4\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau^2}\\right)\\right)
\\; \\; \\;
\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft+%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D%5Cright%29%3D+%5Carctan%281%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%5Cpi%3D4%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%29+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+%5C%3B+_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Likewise we can also see that:

![\\pi=\\dfrac{4}{3}\\left(\\arctan(\\tau)+\\arctan\\left(\\tau^2\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D%5Cdfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7D%5Cleft%28%5Carctan%28%5Ctau%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Ctau%5E2%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Approximately contemporaneously with Nārāyaṇa’s work, apparently
unbeknownst to him, Mādhava, the great mathematician and astronomer from
Cerapada, presented his celebrated infinite series for the
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function:

![\\arctan(x)=\\dfrac{x}{1}-\\dfrac{x^3}{3}+\\dfrac{x^5}{5}-\\dfrac{x^7}{7}...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bx%7D%7B1%7D-%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E3%7D%7B3%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E5%7D%7B5%7D-%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5E7%7D%7B7%7D...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can use the first of the above relationships between
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to obtain an infinite series for the former based on the latter:  
![\\pi=4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}-\\dfrac{1}{3\\tau^3}+\\dfrac{1}{5\\tau^5}-\\dfrac{1}{7\\tau^7}+\\dfrac{1}{9\\tau^9}-\\dfrac{1}{11\\tau^{11}}+\\dfrac{1}{13\\tau^{13}}...+\\dfrac{1}{\\tau^2}-\\dfrac{1}{3\\tau^6}+\\dfrac{1}{5\\tau^{10}}-\\dfrac{1}{7\\tau^{14}}...\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D4%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Ctau%5E3%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Ctau%5E5%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Ctau%5E7%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B9%5Ctau%5E9%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%5Ctau%5E%7B11%7D%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B13%5Ctau%5E%7B13%7D%7D...%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Ctau%5E6%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Ctau%5E%7B10%7D%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Ctau%5E%7B14%7D%7D...%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Gathering terms in order of their exponents we get:  
![\\pi=4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tau}+\\dfrac{1}{\\tau^2}-\\dfrac{1}{3\\tau^3}+\\dfrac{1}{5\\tau^5}-\\dfrac{1}{3\\tau^6}-\\dfrac{1}{7\\tau^7}+\\dfrac{1}{9\\tau^9}+\\dfrac{1}{5\\tau^{10}}-\\dfrac{1}{11\\tau^{11}}+\\dfrac{1}{13\\tau^{13}}-\\dfrac{1}{7\\tau^{14}}...\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D4%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Ctau%5E3%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Ctau%5E5%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Ctau%5E6%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Ctau%5E7%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B9%5Ctau%5E9%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Ctau%5E%7B10%7D%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%5Ctau%5E%7B11%7D%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B13%5Ctau%5E%7B13%7D%7D-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Ctau%5E%7B14%7D%7D...%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One notices that all except the fourth powers are represented. One can
compactly express this as:  
![\\pi=\\displaystyle 4\\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}

Here the cyclic sequence
![a\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is defined thus:  
![a\[n\]=1, a\[n+1\]=2\\cdot (-1)^{m-1}, a\[n+2\]=-1, a\[n+3\]=0;
n=4(m-1)+1; m=1,2,3... a\[n\]=1, 2, -1, 0, 1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, -1,
0...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Bn%5D%3D1%2C+a%5Bn%2B1%5D%3D2%5Ccdot+%28-1%29%5E%7Bm-1%7D%2C+a%5Bn%2B2%5D%3D-1%2C+a%5Bn%2B3%5D%3D0%3B+n%3D4%28m-1%29%2B1%3B+m%3D1%2C2%2C3...+a%5Bn%5D%3D1%2C+2%2C+-1%2C+0%2C+1%2C+-2%2C+-1%2C+0%2C+1%2C+2%2C+-1%2C+0...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Using this series to calculate
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
results in reasonably fast convergence with a nearly linear increase in
the correct digits after the decimal point with every 4 terms. Thus,
with 200 terms we get
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
correct to 53 places after the decimal point (Figure 4). However, we
should keep in mind that
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
actually includes a null term which removes every 4th powers; hence, the
real number of terms is lower by
![\\tfrac{n}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

4

Using just the first 3 terms we get an approximation of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that works as well as
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:

![\\pi \\approx 4
\\left(\\dfrac{3\\tau^2+3\\tau-1}{3\\tau^2+3\\tau+3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+4+%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B3%5Ctau%5E2%2B3%5Ctau-1%7D%7B3%5Ctau%5E2%2B3%5Ctau%2B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can further compare this to the famous single angle
![\\arctan](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
infinite series for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
provided by Mādhava using bhūta-saṃkhya (the Hindu numerical code):

vyāse vāridhi-nihate rūpa-hṛte vyāsa-sāgarābhihate \|  
tri-śarādi-viṣama-saṃkhyā-bhaktaṃ ṛṇaṃ svaṃ pṛthak kramāt kuryāt \|\|  
In the diameter multiplied by the oceans (4) and divided by the form
(1), subtraction and addition \[of terms\] should be repeatedly done of
the diameter multiplied by the oceans (4) and divided respectively by 3,
the arrows (5) and so on of odd numbers.

In modern notation that would be:

![\\pi=\\displaystyle 4\\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty}
\\dfrac{1}{2n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+4%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2n-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

[![](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/narayana_pi_madhava.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/narayana_pi_madhava.png)Figure

This series converges very slowly and in an oscillatory fashion (Figure
5) reaching just 2 correct digits after the decimal point after
computing 200 terms. The oscillatory convergence features an alternation
of better and worse approximations, with the latter showing a curious
feature. For example, with 25 terms we encounter 3.1*8*15 which is
“correct” up to 4 places after the point (3.1415) except for the wrong 8
in the second place. With 50 terms we get 3.1*2*159465, which is correct
to 8 places (3.14159465) after the point except for the wrong 2 at the
second place. More such instances can be found as we go along the
expansion. For example at 500 terms we get:  
3.141592653589793238  
3.1*39*59265*5*5897*8*3238

This is correct to 18 places except for 4 wrong places. Late J. Borwein
and colleagues have reported an occurrence of this phenomenon even in a
calculation of ![5 \\times
10^6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5+%5Ctimes+10%5E6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
terms of this series.

Thus, the double angle series based on
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
fares way better than the basic single angle Mādhava series for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Of course, Mādhava was well aware that it converged very slowly. Hence,
he and others in his school like the Nampūtiri-s, the great Nilakaṇṭha
Somayājin, Jyeṣṭadeva and Citrabhānu, devised some terminal correction
terms to derive alternative series to speed up convergence and obtained
approximations of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that had good accuracy for those times. Two of their series which were
mediocre in convergence speed are in modern notation:

![\\pi=\\displaystyle 4\\left(\\dfrac{3}{4}+\\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty
\\dfrac{-1^{n+1}}{(2n+1)^3-(2n+1)}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+4%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B4%7D%2B%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdfrac%7B-1%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D%7D%7B%282n%2B1%29%5E3-%282n%2B1%29%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This sequence produces ![\\pi \\approx
3.1415926](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3.1415926&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
after 200 terms.

![\\pi=\\displaystyle\\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\dfrac{-1^{n+1} \\cdot
16}{(2n-1)^5+4(2n-1)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdfrac%7B-1%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%5Ccdot+16%7D%7B%282n-1%29%5E5%2B4%282n-1%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This one works better than the above and produces ![\\pi \\approx
3.141592653589](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+3.141592653589&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
after 200 terms

The third uses
![\\tan\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctan%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as a multiplicand:

![\\pi=\\displaystyle\\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\dfrac{-1^{x-1}\\cdot
2\\sqrt{3}}{3^{n-1}(2n-1)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdfrac%7B-1%5E%7Bx-1%7D%5Ccdot+2%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B3%5E%7Bn-1%7D%282n-1%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This series fares much better and produces 97 correct digits after the
decimal point with 200 terms. This is quite impressive because it
outdoes the above double angle series based on ![\\tau,
\\tau^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%2C+%5Ctau%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It is quite likely that Mādhava and Citrabhānu used this series for
around 20-25 terms to obtain approximations such as the below (expressed
in bhūta-saṃkhya):

vibudha-netra-gajāhi-hutāśana-triguṇa-veda-bha-vāraṇa-bāhavaḥ \|  
nava-nikharva-mite vṛtti-vistare paridhimānam idaṃ jagadur budhāḥ \|\|  
The gods (33), eyes (2), elephants (8), snakes (8), the fires thrice
(333), the veda-s (4), the asterisms (27), the elephants (8), the hands
(2) is the measure of the circumference of a circle with diameter of ![9
\\times 10^{11}
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=9+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B11%7D+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
so had stated the mathematicians:

![\\pi \\approx \\dfrac{2827433388233}{900000000000} \\approx
3.14159265359](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cdfrac%7B2827433388233%7D%7B900000000000%7D+%5Capprox+3.14159265359&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

In addition to approximations of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
derived from studies on
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
series we also see that Mādhava’s successors, if not himself, were also
using a sequence of continued fraction convergents of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These were probably inspired by the ability to initially calculate good
approximations using series derived from the
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
series such as the above. Of these a large one is explicitly stated by
Śankara-vāriyar and Nārāyaṇa Nampūtiri in their work the Kriyākramakarī:

vṛtta-vyāse hate nāga-veda-vahny-abdhi-khendubhiḥ \|  
tithy-aśvi-vibudhair bhakte susūkṣmaḥ paridhir bhavet \|\|  
Multiplying the diameter of a circle by snakes(8), veda-s(4), the fires
(3), the oceans (4), the space (0), the moon (1) and dividing it by the
tithi-s (15), Aśvin-s (2), gods (33) one may get the circumference to
good accuracy.

![\\pi \\approx \\dfrac{104348}{33215} \\approx
3.141592653](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cdfrac%7B104348%7D%7B33215%7D+%5Capprox+3.141592653&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
sequence remained a workhorse for calculating
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
long after the heroics of Mādhava’s school. A particularly famous double
angle formula was obtained by Euler with a [simple geometric
proof](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/04/20/eulers-squares/):

![\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)=\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Using this formula we get we get a rather good convergence and reach 122
correct places after the decimal point with 200 terms.

**Tailpiece: From
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
via
![\\arcsin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)**  
We may conclude by noting that the while
![\\tau](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
relates to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
via the
![\\arctan(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function, the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
relates to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
via the
![\\arcsin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function. This stems from the special relationship between
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the sines of the angles
![\\tfrac{3\\pi}{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3%5Cpi%7D%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In the Jyotpatti appendix of his Siddhānta-śiromaṇi’s Bhāskara-II
specifically presents the values of the sines of these angles as common
knowledge of the pūrvācārya-s. We reproduce below his account of the
angles, the closed forms of whose sines were know to them (Note that old
Hindus used Rsine instead of modern
![\\sin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
hence the technical term “trijyā” for
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Originally, Āryabhaṭa had set ![R=\\tfrac{60\\times 180}{\\pi} \\approx
3438'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%3D%5Ctfrac%7B60%5Ctimes+180%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Capprox+3438%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. corresponding approximately to a radian measure in minutes. Below
we take it to be 1 to correspond to our modern
![\\sin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)):

trijyā-vargārdha-padaṃ śaravedāṃśa-jyakā bhavati \|\|  
Half the
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the zodiacal sine (i.e.
![\\tfrac{360^o}{12}=30^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B360%5Eo%7D%7B12%7D%3D30%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Its cosine (i.e. of
![\\cos(30^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%2830%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
will be the sine of
![60^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=60%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The square root of half the square of the
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes the sine of arrows (5) and veda-s (4) degrees ( i.e.
![\\sin(45^o)=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2845%5Eo%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))

From arrow (5) times the square of the
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
subtract the square root of 5 times the
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to the power of 4. Divide what remains from above by 8; the square root
of that gives
![\\sin(36^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2836%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(i.e.
![\\sin(36^o)=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{8}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2836%5Eo%29%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B5-%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%7D%7B8%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))

Bhāskara then goes on to give an approximation for it as fraction:

gaja-haya-gajeṣu nighnī tribhajīvā vā ‘yutena saṃbhaktā \|  
ṣaṭ-triṃśad-aṃśa-jīvā tat koṭijyā kṛteṣuṇām \|\|  
The
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
multiplied by elephants (8), horses (7), elephants (8), arrows (5) and
divided by
![10^4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
gives the sine of
![36^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=36%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Its cosine is the sine of 4 and arrows (5) (i.e.
![\\sin(54^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2854%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).

With this approximation we get ![\\sin(54^o) \\approx
0.80901](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2854%5Eo%29+%5Capprox+0.80901&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
correct to 5 places after the decimal point (one would not it is

and implies that Bhāskara was using an approximation of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
correct to 4 places after the decimal point.

From the square root of the product of the square of
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the arrows (5) subtract
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and divide what is left by 4. This indeed becomes the exact sine of
![18^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=18%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(i.e.
![\\sin(18^o)=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2818%5Eo%29%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).

These basic sines emerge from the first 3 constructible regular
polygons: the equilateral triangle yielding ![\\sin(30^o),
\\sin(60^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2830%5Eo%29%2C+%5Csin%2860%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
the square yielding
![\\sin(45^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2845%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and finally the pentagon yields
![\\sin(18^o)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%2818%5Eo%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and its multiples (Figure 6).

6.

Thus, from the geometry of the regular pentagon (the proof is obvious in
Figure 6) it is seen that these values are rather easily obtained and
can be expressed in terms of the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which emerges in the diagonal to side ratio (Figure 6). Thus, we have:

![\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{10}\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B10%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{3\\pi}{10}\\right)=\\dfrac{\\phi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B3%5Cpi%7D%7B10%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cphi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we can use the first angle in the infinite series for
![\\arcsin(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carcsin%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to obtain the series for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in terms of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:

![\\pi= 10 \\displaystyle \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{(2n)!}{(2n+1)
\\cdot
2^{4n+1}(n!)^2\\phi^{2n+1}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D+10+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdfrac%7B%282n%29%21%7D%7B%282n%2B1%29+%5Ccdot+2%5E%7B4n%2B1%7D%28n%21%29%5E2%5Cphi%5E%7B2n%2B1%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This series fares excellently in computing
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
— with the same 200 terms as used in the above experiments we get the
value correct 208 places after the decimal point.

Now, instead of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
if we resort to the angle
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
from the geometry of the equilateral triangle, we get the below infinite
series:

![\\pi=6 \\displaystyle \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{(2n)!}{(2n+1)\\cdot
2^{4n+1}(n!)^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D6+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdfrac%7B%282n%29%21%7D%7B%282n%2B1%29%5Ccdot+2%5E%7B4n%2B1%7D%28n%21%29%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is obviously worse than the above series with
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and yields 124 correct places after the point with 200 terms. Thus, it
is only marginally better than the Eulerian double angle
![\\arctan](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
series in its performance.

**The arithmetic mean square of a right triangle**  
An entire family of right triangles that includes all the different
forms of right triangles defined in terms of the proportion of their
legs can be obtained by setting their altitude to a constant
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and letting their base
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
vary. The right-angle vertex of these triangles, i.e. that which
contains the right angle is common to both legs and constant across the
family. By the above definition the altitude vertex, i.e. that defined
by the terminus of the altitude, is also constant. The base vertex, i.e.
that defined by the terminus of the base can be seen as continuously
varying as it moves along the line perpendicular to the altitude.

[![arithmetic_mean_sqr_righttriangle_Fig1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/arithmetic_mean_sqr_righttriangle_fig1.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/arithmetic_mean_sqr_righttriangle_fig1.png)Figure

Consider Figure 1:  
For a given right triangle (
![\\triangle{ABC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
the half-hypotenuse square is defined as the square erected on half of
its hypotenuse (
![\\square{BDEF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare%7BBDEF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Then we have the following:

● The feet of the perpendiculars dropped from the vertex of the
half-hypotenuse
![(E)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28E%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
square diagonally opposite to the base vertex to the base and the
altitude of the given right triangle, together with its right-angle
vertex defines a square
![(\\square{CMEN})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csquare%7BCMEN%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

● The area of this square is the sum of the areas of the given right
triangle and the half-hypotenuse square.

● The side of this square is the arithmetic mean of the two legs
![(\\overline{CA}=a,
\\overline{CB}=x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Coverline%7BCA%7D%3Da%2C+%5Coverline%7BCB%7D%3Dx%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the given right triangle.

Hence, the above-defined square
![(\\square{CMEN})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csquare%7BCMEN%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is termed the arithmetic mean square of a give right triangle.

By examining Figure 1, registering all the self-evident congruences and
performing the dissections indicated by the colored and marked areas it
is possible to obtain “wordless” proofs of statements 1 and 2
![\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya the area of the half-hypotenuse square is
![\\tfrac{a^2+x^2}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%5E2%2Bx%5E2%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,

![A(\\square{CMEN})=A(\\square{BDEF}) + A(\\triangle{ABC}) =
\\tfrac{a^2+x^2}{4}
+\\tfrac{ax}{2}=\\left(\\tfrac{a+x}{2}\\right)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28%5Csquare%7BCMEN%7D%29%3DA%28%5Csquare%7BBDEF%7D%29+%2B+A%28%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D%29+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Ba%5E2%2Bx%5E2%7D%7B4%7D+%2B%5Ctfrac%7Bax%7D%7B2%7D%3D%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%2Bx%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, the side of
![\\square{CMEN}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare%7BCMEN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the arithmetic mean of the legs of the given right triangle
![A(\\triangle{ABC})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
![\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus we term this square the arithmetic mean square.

**The characteristic ellipse of right triangles**  
We also note that the shared vertex of the half-hypotenuse square and
the arithmetic mean square of a right triangle (point
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
is the vertex of the semicircle erected on the hypotenuse of the right
triangle (Figure 1). Thus, the segment
![\\overline{EF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BEF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the diameter of the maximal circle that can be inscribed in the
above semicircle (Figure 2). Now, if we draw a perpendicular to the base
of the right triangle at the base vertex
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then the perpendicular will cut the inscribed maximal circle at two
points ![G,
H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C+H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 2). What will be the locus of ![G,
H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C+H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the base of the triangle
![\\overline{CB}=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCB%7D%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
grows in size? In what range of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in terms of the altitude
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will this intersection will happen (i.e. for what range of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
units will the locus exist)?

Figure 2

To answer the above let us place point
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at origin. Then, given the above-described arithmetic mean square of a
right triangle we have the coordinates of its vertex and that of the
semicircle erected on the hypotenuse to be
![E=(\\tfrac{a+x}{2},\\tfrac{a+x}{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%2Bx%7D%7B2%7D%2C%5Ctfrac%7Ba%2Bx%7D%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is also one end of a diameter of the maximal circle inscribed in
the semicircle. The second end of this diameter is the midpoint of the
hypotenuse
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Therefore, the coordinates of ![F=(\\tfrac{x}{2},
\\tfrac{a}{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3D%28%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can get the midpoint of the the segment
![\\overline{EF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BEF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to be
![I=(\\tfrac{2x+a}{4},\\tfrac{x+2a}{4})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%3D%28%5Ctfrac%7B2x%2Ba%7D%7B4%7D%2C%5Ctfrac%7Bx%2B2a%7D%7B4%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The coordinates of point
![G](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(or of point
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)),
which lies on the desired locus will be
![G=(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%3D%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From circle ![\\circ
I](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccirc+I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using the equivalence of its two radii we can write the following:  
![\\overline{FI}^2=\\overline{GI}^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BFI%7D%5E2%3D%5Coverline%7BGI%7D%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

But
![\\overline{FI}^2=\\tfrac{1}{4}\\overline{AB}^2=\\tfrac{x^2+a^2}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BFI%7D%5E2%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%5E2%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%5E2%2Ba%5E2%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore

The above equation of the locus is a quadratic equation in two
variables. Hence, it is a conic. Now given a general conic
![Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Ax%5E2%2BBxy%2BCy%5E2%2BDx%2BEy%2BF%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
its shape is determined by the conic discriminant:

![\\delta_c=-4\\Delta=-4 \\begin{vmatrix} A & B \\big /2\\\\ B \\big /2&
C \\end{vmatrix}
=B^2-4AC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_c%3D-4%5CDelta%3D-4+%5Cbegin%7Bvmatrix%7D+A+%26+B+%5Cbig+%2F2%5C%5C+B+%5Cbig+%2F2%26+C+%5Cend%7Bvmatrix%7D+%3DB%5E2-4AC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

If
![\\delta_c\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_c%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
then we have an ellipse. In the special case of ![A=C,
B=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3DC%2C+B%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it reduces to a circle. If
![\\delta_c=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_c%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have a parabola. If
![\\delta_c\>0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_c%3E0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have a hyperbola. In our case ![\\delta_c=4-4 \\times 1 \\times
4=-12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_c%3D4-4+%5Ctimes+1+%5Ctimes+4%3D-12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the desired locus is an ellipse (Figure 3).

[![triangle_ellipse_problem_Fig3](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/triangle_ellipse_problem_fig3.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/triangle_ellipse_problem_fig3.png)

Figure 3

We can now rewrite the equation of the ellipse explicitly as:  
![\\dfrac{x+2a \\pm
\\sqrt{4ax-3x^2}}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Bx%2B2a+%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B4ax-3x%5E2%7D%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The discriminant of this equation is:  
![\\Delta=\\sqrt{4ax-3x^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%3D%5Csqrt%7B4ax-3x%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
it will be real only when: ![0 \\le x \\le
\\tfrac{4a}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+x+%5Cle+%5Ctfrac%7B4a%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From this we can see that the ellipse will exist only in the interval:  
![\\left(0,\\tfrac{a}{2}\\right)..\\left(\\tfrac{4a}{3},
\\tfrac{5a}{6}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%280%2C%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29..%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B4a%7D%7B3%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B5a%7D%7B6%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, at those two points ![G,
H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C+H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
become coincident. Thus, the altitude of the right triangles is a
tangent to this ellipse at
![\\left(0,\\tfrac{a}{2}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%280%2C%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3). Further, since we have the coordinates of point
![I](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the center of the maximal circle inscribed in the hypotenuse semicircle,
we can show that as
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
increases
![I](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
moves along the line
![y=\\tfrac{1}{2}x+\\tfrac{3a}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dx%2B%5Ctfrac%7B3a%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, outside the above interval we see that the right triangle’s base
moves beyond the maximal inscribed circle and the perpendicular to the
base at
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will never touch this circle.

A shape of a triangle is characterized by the relative proportion of its
3 sides. For a right triangle we have further constraint; hence its
shape is defined by the relative proportion of its legs. Thus, a right
triangle with legs in proportion
![a_1:b_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Ab_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the same as that with
![b_1:a_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%3Aa_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
— just that they are rotated with respect to each other. Using this
concept we, can see that various landmarks of the characteristic ellipse
correspond to notable underlying right triangles (Figure 4). The extreme
left bound of the ellipse corresponds to the degenerate case where one
leg is 0 and the hypotenuse and the other leg coincide. As we determined
above, the right bound of the ellipse corresponds to
![x=\\tfrac{4a}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7B4a%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, this corresponds to the famous
![3,4,5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C4%2C5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. It is remarkable how
![3,4,5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C4%2C5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle, which represents the most basic bhujā-koṭi-karṇa triplet,
comes up as a natural feature associated with the characteristic
ellipse.

Now that we have its equation we can also see that the ellipse will have
a maximum at the point
![(a,a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Ca%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and a minimum at the point ![\\left(\\tfrac{a}{3},
\\tfrac{a}{3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B3%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The maximum corresponds to isosceles right triangle (Figure 4). The
minimum of the ellipse corresponds the
![1,3,\\sqrt{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C3%2C%5Csqrt%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle (Figure 4). At both these positions the separation between the
ellipse-generating points ![G,
H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C+H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is
![\\tfrac{a}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

When
![x=\\tfrac{2a}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7B2a%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the ellipse-generating line passes through the center of the ellipse,
point ![C_e=\\left(\\tfrac{2a}{3},
\\tfrac{2a}{3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_e%3D%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2a%7D%7B3%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B2a%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4). This results in the maximal separation attained between the
ellipse-generating points ![G,
H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C+H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of
![\\tfrac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This corresponds to the
![2,3,\\sqrt{13}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2C3%2C%5Csqrt%7B13%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle. In this triangle the ratio of the sum of the long and middle
sides to the short side is the Bronze ratio, which we shall encounter
again discuss in greater detail below.

When
![x=\\tfrac{a}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have the underlying
![1,2,\\sqrt{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C2%2C%5Csqrt%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangle (Figure 4). As is obvious, the ratio of the sum of the short
and the long side of this triangle to the middle side is the Golden
ratio
![(\\phi)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cphi%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, not surprisingly, the separation between the ellipse-generating
points at this value of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is
![\\tfrac{2\\phi-1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cphi-1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Another notable feature of this case is that only in this configuration
the lines drawn parallel to the base of the triangle at the
ellipse-generating points
![G,H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2CH&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are tangents to the ellipse-generating circle.

Between ![\\tfrac{3a}{4} \\le x \\le
\\tfrac{4a}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B3a%7D%7B4%7D+%5Cle+x+%5Cle+%5Ctfrac%7B4a%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(colored section of ellipse in Figure 4), we get similar triangles on
either side of
![x=a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3Da&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
However, to the left of that region every triangle has a unique shape.

**The bronze ratio and the characteristic ellipse**  
Given the general conic equation
![Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Ax%5E2%2BBxy%2BCy%5E2%2BDx%2BEy%2BF%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
one can calculate the eccentricity of the corresponding ellipse as:  
![e_e=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2\\sqrt{(A-C)^2+B^2}}{A+C+\\sqrt{(A-C)^2+B^2}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_e%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B2%5Csqrt%7B%28A-C%29%5E2%2BB%5E2%7D%7D%7BA%2BC%2B%5Csqrt%7B%28A-C%29%5E2%2BB%5E2%7D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By substituting the requisite values, we get  
![e_e=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{13}-13}{6}} \\approx
0.9154012](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_e%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B5%5Csqrt%7B13%7D-13%7D%7B6%7D%7D+%5Capprox+0.9154012&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, we consider the Bronze ratio ![\\beta=\\tfrac{3+\\sqrt{13}}{2}
\\approx
3.302776](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%3D%5Ctfrac%7B3%2B%5Csqrt%7B13%7D%7D%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+3.302776&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We observe that ![\\beta'=\\tfrac{1}{\\beta}=\\beta-3 \\approx
0.302776](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cbeta%7D%3D%5Cbeta-3+%5Capprox+0.302776&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![\\beta,
-\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%2C+-%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are conjugate roots of the quadratic equation
![x^2-3x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-3x-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One immediately notes the parallel to the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
![\\phi'
=\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}=\\phi-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27+%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D%3D%5Cphi-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and likewise ![\\phi,
-\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%2C+-%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are the roots of the equation
![x^2-x-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2-x-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(see appendix for more). Thus, we can write the eccentricity of the
characteristic ellipse as:  
![\\sqrt{\\dfrac{5\\beta'+1}{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cdfrac%7B5%5Cbeta%27%2B1%7D%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

With the eccentricity we can determine the axes of the ellipse; we see
that:  
![a\_{smin}=\\dfrac{a\\sqrt{1+\\beta}}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bsmin%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5Csqrt%7B1%2B%5Cbeta%7D%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
…semi-major axis

![a\_{smaj}=\\dfrac{a}{\\sqrt{3(1+\\beta)}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bsmaj%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Ba%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%281%2B%5Cbeta%29%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
…semi-minor axis

As an aside the area of the characteristic ellipse is therefore
![A=\\tfrac{\\pi
a^2}{3\\sqrt{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi+a%5E2%7D%7B3%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We also get the aspect ratio of the ellipse to be:  
![AR=\\dfrac{a\_{smaj}}{a\_{smin}}=\\dfrac{1+\\beta}{\\sqrt{3}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=AR%3D%5Cdfrac%7Ba_%7Bsmaj%7D%7D%7Ba_%7Bsmin%7D%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%2B%5Cbeta%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Interestingly, the connection of the characteristic ellipse to the
bronze ratio does not end with the parameters of the ellipse itself. Its
inclination, i.e. the slope of the line joining the two foci of the
ellipse (i.e. the tangent of the angle made by this focal line with the
base of the right triangles) is
![\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, the equation of the local line of the characteristic ellipse is:  
![y=\\beta'x+\\dfrac{2a}{1+\\beta}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cbeta%27x%2B%5Cdfrac%7B2a%7D%7B1%2B%5Cbeta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

[![triangle_ellipse_problem_Fig5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/triangle_ellipse_problem_fig5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/triangle_ellipse_problem_fig5.png)Figure
5

Interestingly, when
![x=\\beta'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Cbeta%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
it is only time the diameter of ellipse-generating circle perpendicular
to the hypotenuse of the right triangle (i.e.
![\\overline{EF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BEF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
becomes parallel to the focal line of the ellipse and acquires the
equation:  
![y=\\beta'(x+\\dfrac{3a}{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cbeta%27%28x%2B%5Cdfrac%7B3a%7D%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 5).

Thus, by doing some algebra we can see that the difference in the
intercepts is
![\\tfrac{a}{26\\beta+8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7B26%5Cbeta%2B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is one of few rare occurrences of the Bronze ratio as persistent
feature in geometry and to our knowledge is described here for the first
time.

**Appendix: Bronze ratio**  
A simple geometric interpretation of the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
goes thus: If we construct a rectangle such that upon removing a square
whose side is equal to the smaller side of the said rectangle we are
left with a remainder rectangle whose aspect ratio is the same as the
original rectangle then the aspect ratio of these rectangles is
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6). Likewise, if we get a similarly-shaped remainder rectangle
upon removing two equal squares whose sides are equal to the shorter
side of the starting rectangle then their aspect ratio is the Silver
ratio
![\\sigma=1+\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%3D1%2B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 6). These two ratios are also associated with diagonals of a
pentagon and an octagon respectively. If upon removing 3 squares we have
similarly proportioned remainder rectangle as the original one then
their aspect ratio is the Bronze ratio
![\\beta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is not associated with any polygon.

6

All these “metallic” ratios, their reciprocals, and negative conjugates
have a common feature in that they can be described by the general
double hyperbolic equation with asymptotes as
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
and the lines ![y=x;
y=-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%3B+y%3D-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 7),  
![y^4-x^2y^2-2y^2+1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E4-x%5E2y%5E2-2y%5E2%2B1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

They emerge as the solutions
![m_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the biquadratic equation in
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the integer values of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):  
![m_n=\\dfrac{\\pm n \\pm
\\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpm+n+%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%5E2%2B4%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, ![n=1 \\rightarrow \\phi; n=2 \\rightarrow \\sigma; n=3
\\rightarrow \\beta
...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1+%5Crightarrow+%5Cphi%3B+n%3D2+%5Crightarrow+%5Csigma%3B+n%3D3+%5Crightarrow+%5Cbeta+...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This also shows that they all follow the conjugate principle with
respect to their conjugates, i.e. ![m_n-n=\\tfrac{1}{m_n};
m_n^2=1+nm_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_n-n%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bm_n%7D%3B+m_n%5E2%3D1%2Bnm_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
As the double hyperbola converges to its asymptotes the fractional parts
of the ratios converge to 0. Thus, it only the first few metallic ratios
are likely to be “interesting”. Indeed the Golden ratio is a common
encountered in all manner of mathematical situations. The Silver ratio
is seen to a lesser extant and the Bronze ratio is even rarer in it
occurrence (conversely to the metals after which they are named). Beyond
the Bronze ratio these ratios are mostly “uninteresting” in that they
are rarely found in mathematical entities.

The above geometric operation of rectangle dissection is equivalent to
the abstract string substitution operation under the rules
![1\\rightarrow 1^k0, 0 \\rightarrow
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Crightarrow+1%5Ek0%2C+0+%5Crightarrow+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Here the
![1^k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Ek&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
means
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
repetitions of 1. For
![k=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
a string initiated with 1 grows thus:  
![1\\rightarrow 10\\rightarrow 101\\rightarrow 10110\\rightarrow
10110101\\rightarrow

One observes that ratio of 1s:0s in these strings converges to
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Likewise, the ratio of the length of the string
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to that of string
![n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also converges to
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

For
![k=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the string grows thus:  
![1\\rightarrow 110\\rightarrow 1101101\\rightarrow
11011011101101110\\rightarrow
11011011101101110110110111011011101101101\\rightarrow

Here the ratio of 1s:0s and the ratio of the length of the string
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
length of string
![n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
converge to the Silver ratio
![\\sigma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

For
![k=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the string grows thus:

which is at the root of some remarkable behavior which we shall explore
in the next article.

The bus came to halt at the underground stop. Vrishchika of pretty
tresses got off the bus and walked up the stairs to reach the
over-bridge. She reached the middle of the bridge and stood there
looking out expectantly at the road. It was a remarkably clear day and
she could see the yonder horizon where the azure heights of father Dyaus
met his lover mother Pṛthivī clad in the verdant vesture of the distant
woods. Vrishchika passed into a reverie at that sight and remained
oblivious to the throng of people who criss-crossed the bridge in either
direction. Suddenly, an ugly man sidled up beside her and before she
could react to his presence he said: “Ma’am do you visit the Hindu
temple at Śukramārga?” Vrishchika: “On rare occasions.” The man
responded: “We need wealthy patrons like you to visit the temple more
often and make donations. Please do so devī”. So saying he handed a
pamphlet to her. Vrishchika wondered: “A soothsayer at the temple of the
Vāyu-born vānara had once told my family that I would be the wealthiest
of all my sisters. But I’m hardly in that state now. Yet, why does he
even think I’m wealthy?” She snapped out of that train of thought and
waved the ugly man away saying “śubham astu! It is far way from my place
but I’ll try.”

She continued to look out at the road and not seeing what she wanted to
see, she turned to the pamphlet. It was crowded with temple events.
There was a Rudra-pūjā for the 13th pradoṣa and a Viṣṇu-pūjā for the
ekādaśī. There was another event for Vināyaka, for which there was a
call for people to join in a mass-recitation of the Gaṇeśopaniṣat. Yet
another corner mentioned a Vaṭakini-mahotsava for the fierce ape. Then
there was some announcements of secular events. A professor of Indian
origin, who was popular with the people at the local chapter of the
“right-wing debate club”, with a penchant for peddling false etymologies
and outrageous counter-factual theories was giving a lecture series
covering issues such as the autochthonous origin of Aryans, reading
Vedic mantra-s in the Harappan inscriptions, and situating the
Mahābhārata at earlier than 5000 years in India. Vrishchika said to
herself: “I’m sure the puruṣa would find this buffoon quite amusing
where it not for the pernicious consequences it has on our people.” Then
there was a call for people to attend classes for language acquisition
or learning the recitation of five sūkta-s from the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda. She
noticed that the latter was organized by a bābā-crazed young lady who
had been her patient.

Just as her eyes wandered to the next item on the pamphlet the corner of
her vision lit up with the sight of a bus halting on the road below and
Indrasena saunter out of it. Upon meeting midway at the bridge the two
walked ahead to towards the station to board the train for a long ride
back home. Vrishchika: “Dear Ātreya, when I was waiting on the bridge, I
received this temple pamphlet from a man who, if my vague recollection
is correct, evidently supplements his income by playing a horoscopist
and palm-reader at the temple on Śukramārga. What is interesting is that
just as I caught sight of you I was reading this little announcement
here.” Saying so she handed it over to Indrasena. Even as he was looking
at it she articulated it: “It looks as though this banker Atigupta Sādhu
is commissioning the consecration of an image of the Yakṣarāṭ in the
northern niche of the temple on the ekadaśī of next month. It reminded
me that you have yet to impart to me the rahasya of the ekadaśī-vrata
that you had mentioned long ago in your hometown.” Indrasena: “That’s
quite remarkable. There is actually more than what meets the eye here.
Indeed, it was in my mind too that I convey the vidyā to you, O daughter
of an Aṅgiras, for after all I’d need a dīkṣita-patnī when I impart it
to the ācārya who will be doing that sthāpanā.”

Vrishchika: “That’s interesting. So you were aware of this?”  
Indrasena: “Yes Alini. There is a long story here that I’ve not had the
chance to tell you.”  
Vrishchika: “I’m now very curious to hear it all.”  
Indrasena: “Atigupta Sādhu was the student of a charismatic mantravādinī
from the regions of Mahākāla. He had received a magic square of Rājarāja
from her and consequently his wealth greatly expanded as befits a V3. He
wanted to install an image of Dhanada at the temple at Śukramārga. He
employed none other than the initial teacher of mine the vaṅgasiṃha, for
whom there is no “tataḥ kim?” after “dhanaṃ meru-tulyam” and he was
almost half an Uesugi Kenshin of the prācya-s. But, as I’ve told you
before, he only possessed incomplete vidyā-s. Thus, his sthāpanā failed
like that of Skanda by the marāṭhā chief Raghunātharāu and the image was
damaged when lightning struck the temple. The V3 was distraught and went
to his teacher back in Mālava. She happened have studied some
śāstra-siddhānta under Lootika. She then consulted your sister, who not
wanting to give out my identity publicly told her that if Vitteśa were
to be pleased with the said V3 he would find the right V1 who will solve
his samasyā. The vaṇij went around for a while until he circuitously got
introduced to me by Somakhya. I told the V3 that I could not be a
sthāpakācārya at a temple but I could impart a key vrata to the vaiṣṇava
sthāpaka at the temple who would then achieve success with the endeavor
upon performing the vrata. This, my pretty girl, is the whole story. The
vrata is none other than the one of the ekādaśī that I’ll expound to you
once we are home.”

Back home, taking in the good night air and the dark canopy of the
nakṣatra-s, Indrasena expounded to his wife the rahasya-s of the
Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam: “Dear Gautamī, first you must know why it is
called the Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam and why the ekādaśī is considered
the day of the yakṣa lord. In this regard the following has been
narrated by the brāhmaṇa Mahātapās to king Prajāpāla in the
Varāhapurāṇa:

sarva-kāmān avāpnoti svarga-lokañ ca gacchati \|\|

The sage Mahātapas narrated this legend to king Prajāpāla:  
Now, listen to that other sin-destroying tale of the origin of the lord
of wealth, regarding how the wealth-giver arose from the body of the god
Vāyu. Within what was the primordial body, Vāyu came into being situated
in its interior. For the purpose of assuming a discrete form the deity
of the regions \[Vāyu\] emerged forth. Now, the origin of that form of
Vāyu will be made known by me. O sinless and most fortunate you ought
listen that narrated by me. Due to the god Brahmā’s creative desire Vāyu
issued forth from his face. \[He emerged\] with a tremendous shower of
grit/gravel. Brahmā restrained him by saying: “You should take on a
pacific discrete form.” He took the form as stated by Brahmā. \[Brahmā
said\]: “all this wealth of the gods, whatever they produce, you must
indeed protect it”. Thus, due to what was said by Brahmā he became
Dhanapati. The pleased lord Brahmā gave the ekādaśī \[as his\] lunar
day. On that day, if one with discipline purifies himself and only eats
food which is not cooked by fire, then the god Dhanada is pleased and
gives him everything. This form of Dhanapati destroys all that is ill.
If one verily listens to this narrative with devotion or the person
recites it, then he attains all desires and goes to the heavenly realm.

Now, Vrishchika tell me what you think of this narrative?”

V: “I believe it had its roots in the ancient Indo-Iranian system of the
supreme Vāyu, with a Prājāpatya overlay atop that. Indeed Kubera and
Vāyu simultaneously figure as mighty deities in the backdrop of the
Rāmāyaṇa and to some extent also in the Mahābhārata. Hence, their
connection does not seem unexpected. Moreover, along with the other
deity of the same class, Rudra, the three of them adorn the northern
face of the dik-maṇḍala — NE-N-NW. The primordial body referred to in
this narrative is verily the puruṣa of the śruti. There indeed it has
been said ‘prāṇād vāyur ajāyata \|‘ and Vāyu was seen as the breath
within the puruṣa. In this myth we see an allusion the the role of Vāyu
in the creative process. It is amply clear from the śruti that in the
old system focused on Vāyu he was conceived as playing a central role in
this process. Indeed, in the mantra to Vāyu-Vāta we hear:  
‘ātmā devānām bhuvanasya garbho  
yathā-vaśaṃ carati deva eṣaḥ \|  
ghoṣā id asya śṛṇvire na rūpaṃ  
tasmai vātāya haviṣā vidhema \|\|’  
The breath of the gods, the germ of the universe,  
this god wanders as he wishes.  
Only his sounds are heard, not \[seen is\] his form.  
For him, for Vāta, we would do honor with our oblation.

We see here that the deity is presented as the germ of the universe
(reflective of the creative process) and his formlessness which is
alluded to in the myth you narrated is also a central element of this
mantra. Tellingly, the very first mantra of the sūkta captures aspects
of his storminess mentioned in this myth as he emerged from the face of
Brahmā with a shower of grit.:  
‘vātasya nu mahimānaṃ rathasya  
rujann eti stanayann asya ghoṣaḥ \|  
divispṛg yāty aruṇāni kṛṇvann  
uto eti pṛthivyā reṇum asyan \|\|’  
Now for the greatness of Vāta and his chariot:  
smashing he proceeds; thundering is his noise.  
Touching heaven as he drives, making things red,  
also blowing up dust from the earth he goes.

Thus, I would conclude that at the foundation of the Varāha-purāṇa
narrative are clear motifs coming from the old Vāyu-centric system such
as those expressed in the sūkta I just mentioned.”

I.s: “That is good, Vrishichika. It touches on something which will come
up again as I expound the ritual itself. One may also note the this idea
of the Vāyu within the primordial body might have been behind another
somewhat mysterious name of the god — Mātariśvan — he who grows within
the mother or womb. Thus, it is likely that what was meant in this name
was Vāyu filling up the interior of the ‘primordial womb’. His emergence
from the mouth of the protogonic deity is something that evidently had a
deep history: While in the Puruṣa-sūkta it is Indra and Agni who emerge
from the Puruṣa’s mouth, we have a bauddha text the
Avalokiteśvara-guṇa-karaṇḍavyūha where the nāstika-s have appropriated
the mythologem of the puruṣa for their invention, the Avalokiteśvara. In
that text we hear of the various gods emerging from the different organs
of the macranthropic Avalokiteśvara and Vāyu is specifically mentioned
as emerging from his mouth. This suggests the existence of an old āstika
source with such an imagery from which this concept was borrowed by the
bauddhas.

Now further, while in the Varāha-purāṇa myth the motifs acquired from
the Vāyu-focused system may have been placed in a Prājāpatya context
typical of the earlier paurāṇika narratives, we must not miss the fact
that right from the beginning Vāyu had an intimate connection with the
protogonic deity with roots likely going back to the para-Vedic systems
of the Indo-Iranian period with evolutes lasting until much latter on
both the Indian and Iranian sides. This is already apparent in the
prājāpatya portions of the late śruti. In the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa we
hear: ‘sa eṣa vāyuḥ prajapatiḥ \|‘ (This Vāyu is Prajāpati). It is
further expounded in the Kauśītaki-brāhmaṇa that the manifest form of
Prajāpati is Vāyu: ‘prajāpateḥ pratyaksaṃ rupaṃ yad vāyur iti\|‘. The
Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa goes on to even present Prajāpati as a composite of
himself and Vāyu: ‘ardhaṃ ha prajāpater vayuḥ \| ardham prajapatiḥ \|
Regarding this intimate connection between the two deities, I could
point to a rather late survival of this idea in the Garuḍa-purāṇa
(mokṣa-kāṇḍa) in a rather pristine form albeit lodged within a larger,
quite unwholesome Vaiṣṇava section, which tries to establish the
superiority of Viṣṇu over the other gods:  
‘annābhimānaṃ brahma cāhur murāriṃ  
jīvābhimānaṃ vāyum āhur mahāntaḥ \|  
na śakto ‘sau brahma-devo vivastuṃ  
vāyuṃ vinā saṃsṛtāv eva nityam \|\|  
na taṃ vinā mātariśvā ca vastum  
anyonyam āptiḥ kālato nyūnatā ca \|  
yadā mahat-tattvani yāmako bhūd  
brahmāṇḍānta-sthūla-sṛṣṭau mahātmā \|\|  
tadā vāyur nāśakadvai mahātmā  
bāhye sṛṣṭau kālabhedena cāsti \|’  
The great sages have declared that Brahmā and Murāri (Viṣṇu) are the
nutritive principle, \[whereas\] Vāyu is the metabolic principle.
Verily, this god Brahma does not have ever the ability to emit the
universe without Vāyu. Without him (Brahmā) Mātariśvan (Vāyu) does not
have place to dwell. (O great soul), their relative strengths and wants
depends on the course of time. When \[Brahmā\] restrained of the
principles \[evolving from\] mahat in the \[primordial\] world-egg from
manifesting as material creation Vāyu could not set it motion. The
evolution of the manifest universe \[by Vāyu\] happens only with passage
of time.

Thus, Alini, in this system Vāyu and Brahmā are close and almost equal
partners in the manifestation of the material universe. Indeed, it
appears that these ideas were preserved by a group of late-surviving
Vāyu-focused thinkers who later converted to the Vaiṣṇava-mata in
southern India. This becomes apparent from a discussion occurring
earlier in this section of the Garuḍa-purāṇa wherein the votaries are
asked to set up an image of Vāyu and worship it. However, it is then
clarified that Vāyu is merely a symbol of Viṣṇu and that Vāyu should
only be offered the ucchiṣṭa of Viṣṇu. Notably, it warns votaries who
offer fresh flowers, sandalwood and incense to Vāyu and says that they
would eternally suffer unless they meditate on Viṣṇu as an expiation.
The last statement clinches their Vāyu-focality prior to their
conversion. Their unconverted versions still exist, albeit in a
degenerate form, in the Lāṭa country — a point we will revisit in the
context of the paramparā of our ritual.”

V: “Ah! Having sat in on a discussion Lootika and Somakhya once had, I
do see the parallels to the comparable Iranic systems. In the
Zoroastrian stream of the Iranic tradition, despite all the demonization
of the ancestral deva-s, Vāyu still retains his primacy. In the yasht of
Rama Hvastra even Ahura Mazdāh worships Vāyu to aid him in creation by
countering Angra Mainyu. In the para-Zoroastrian system of Zurvān
(Avestan: Zrva, cognate of Sanskrit sarva) he comes as an integral
partner of the great time deity Zurvān who has a fundamentally
protogonic character. Thus, Zurvān, associated with time and Vāyu
associated with space are the heart of the genesis of this Iranic
system. The integral association of Zurvān and Vāyu is already seen in
the Zoroastrian Avesta where they are invoked together and are supplied
with the epithet ‘deregho khvadhāta (dīrgha-svadhātṛ in our tongue)’.
i.e. those who have long-standing law of their own. That Zurvān was an
old deity with his own system is seen from the occurrence of his name
close to the Avestan form in the Nuzi documents from Iraq dating to
around 3200-3400 years ago where we find some of the earliest
attestations of the Iranians in archaeology. This association is also
recorded by Eudemus of Rhodes, the student of Aristotle, who notes that
the Iranians regard Time (Zurvān) and Space (Vāyu) as the foundational
principles of the universe. That he was referring to the
para-Zoroastrian Zurvān worshipers becomes apparent from a comparable
system presented in Zurvānistic Iranic traditions preserved by the
Zoroastrians in their Denkart, where Zurvan as time is the generative
principle and Vāyu provides the space for the entities that come into
being due to Zurvan. There, Vāyu is also the one who conveys the good
things bestowed by Zurvān to men — this perhaps captures a bit of his
nature as the messenger, which we see in his Mātariśvan form in our
tradition. Thus, his association with the Iranic protogonic deities, be
he Ahura Mazdāh or Zrva, in the generative process is indeed a parallel
to his association with Brahmā in our tradition.”

I.s: “As we move from Vāyu, who was specifically hymned by your ancestor
Vāmadeva, to Kubera, we again find these parallels between Indo-Aryan
and Iranian tradition as illuminating their association. Clearly in our
tradition Vāyu-Vāta has both a benign and malignant nature. In the
mantra you mentioned he is described as \`’rujan’ i.e. smashing. This
nature is clearly brought out in his earthly epic manifestations, the
ape Hanūmat and the Pāṇḍava Bhīma. On the other hand, as you correctly
mentioned, in the Iranic tradition Vāyu conveys the good things of
Zurvan to men. This is his benign aspect which comes up in the second
such Vāta-sūkta in the RV:  
vāta ā vātu bheṣajaṃ śambhu mayobhu no hṛde \|  
pra ṇa āyūṃṣi tāriṣat \|\|  
uta vāta pitāsi na uta bhrātota naḥ sakhā \|  
sa no jīvātave kṛdhi \|\|  
yad ado vāta te gṛhe ‘mṛtasya nidhir hitaḥ \|  
tato no dehi jīvase \|\|’  
May Vāta blow towards us a medicine, which is auspicious and conferring
weal to our heart. May he lengthen our lives.  
O Vāta, you are father to us, and brother, and also a friend to us. Make
us live long.  
O Vāta, what wealth of ambrosia has been placed yonder in your house,
give us of that for us to live.  
Here, we see that the benign aspect of Vāyu is emphasized with him being
a bearer of medicines (note a similar role played by Hanūmat in the
Rāmāyaṇa), fellowship and the ambrosia. Importantly, note the amṛtasya
nidhiḥ, which becomes important for the connection with the Mahārāja. On
the Iranian side Vāyu again is invoked for benign gifts such as
protection from yātudhāna-s, a long life, offspring, and by women for a
good husband. On the other-hand, he is also the fierce ‘pitiless Vāyu’,
the bone-breaker (Astovidhātu) who slays the man (the bone-crushing
facet is well represented in the earthly emanations of our Vāyu, Hanūmat
and Bhīma, who more generally also have a certain malignant side to
them, which, O Gautami, your ancestors are said to have faced in the
case of the former). Thus, in later Iranic tradition we hear of two
Vāyu-s, the Vāy i veh the good Vāyu and the Vāy i vattar, the evil Vāyu,
who in the Iranic text known as the greater Bundahishn is explicitly
termed Astovidhātu who causes death.

Thus, even in our origin myth of Kubera, the two facets of Vāyu are
clearly laid out. He originally emerges in what is evidently his malefic
form showering gravel/grit and then assumes a benefic form which becomes
Kubera. Notably, Kubera, like Vāyu in the RV mantra, also holds the
nidhi of amṛta, which is described as the honey of Jambhala, known to
the V1s who have mastered the Kaubera lore, in the Mahābhārata.”

V: “Dear Ātreya, may be in the regard I should add that this benign form
of Vāyu, which becomes Vaiśravaṇa might relate to the magical
concealment power of the yakṣa-s, tirodhā that is alluded to multiple
times in the śruti. On one hand it connects Kubera with the primordial
goddess Virāj. The Puruṣa hymn, echoing the cyclic generation of the
primordial god Dākṣa and goddess Aditi from each other, states that the
goddess Virāj arose from the Puruṣa and that conversely the Puruṣa arose
from Virāj. The Atharvāṅgirasa-śruti adds that Kubera was a calf of this
goddess Virāj in the form of Tirodhā which conferred the concealment
(tirodhā) capacity on his folk (i.e. the yakṣa-s). This is again
mentioned and worshipped in his ritual in the Taittirīya-śruti. In the
AV it is said that he who knows this thing about Kubera causes his
pāpaman to vanish, whereas in the TA it makes his enemies disappear,
like the prācya Uesugi Kenshin experienced with his devotions. This
again reflects the beneficent nature of this deity whose origin is from
the primordial being. Perhaps the tirodhā power, which the
Taittirīyaka-s describe as coming from the waters represents, the
benefic clouds brought by Vāyu as opposed to the destructive sand storm.

Finally, before we go to the ritual, O Atri, I would like to to ask you
if you can think of any parallels to the connection between Vāyu and
Vaiśravaṇa which might exist in the Iranian world?”

I.s.: “Firstly, O Āṅgirasī, it is pleasing to see that you have
thoroughly acquired the śrauta-siddhānta of Puṇyajaneśa. Regarding your
question — I am aware of no direct cognate of Kubera in the early Iranic
world. However, we may note the following: interestingly, even in the
Avesta the benign Vāyu is described as being associated with gold, a
characteristic of the Yakṣarāṭ. Subsequently, among the non-Zoroastrian
and para-Zoroastrian Iranics of the Kuṣāṇa empire it appears that the
personification of royal power, Avestan Khvarena (Kuṣāṇa: Pharro), came
to identified with Vaiśravaṇa. This is not surprising given both their
association with royal power. This led to syncretic depictions in the
Kuṣaṇa age that appear to have eventually reached the eastern steppes
whose new masters were the Turkic and Mongolic people. This greatly
influenced the development of the Kubera-like deity Kut-Tengri among the
Uighurs and other central Asian Turks.”

V: “Now, O Atricandra, expound to me details of the ritual — the
observances, actions and the mantra-s.”  
I.s: “Sure. The vrata, as has been specified, should be done on an
ekādaśī, either in the afternoon or in the evening. After having had a
bath the ritualists should observe purity and abstain from sexual
activity for the entire day. They should eat air-dried fruits and nuts.
They should abstain from consuming milk products but they may drink
fresh fruit juices. In old Bhārata the ideal spot for the ritual was
said to be under an aśvattha or a vaṭa tree but these days such spots
are difficult to come by.

First the ritualists should offer tarpaṇa to the key teachers of the
lineage: the founder was a sage of the Vaikhānasa clan. That knowledge
then passed on to the queen Vāsavadattā. Her son the renowned
Naravāhanadatta was next. His minister Gomukha was next. These were the
teachers of the lore at Kauśāmbī. Then the lore was taught at the holy
city of Mathurā, where all the great dharma-s were expounded by the
mantra-vit-s. As you know both Somakhya and I trace our lineages to
gharāṃnāya-s of that holy city. There it was taught in the center known
as the Yakṣa-guhā, which is today Maholi near the Mathurā city. Here the
teachers were Gomitraka and Kunika. From there the tradition moved to
Gopagiri (modern Gwalior), where it was taught by your old clansmen, the
Gotama Rudradāsa and his son Śivatrāta. From them it was transmitted to
Śivanemi, Śivabhadra and Kubhaka.” From there it was transmitted along
the Candravati river (modern West Banas) to the V1 Maṇibhadra who lived
in Vāyvagrahāra (a little hamlet near modern Banaskantha) in the
Lāṭānarta country. He transmitted it to his students Kuberadatta and
Yakṣamitra who lived at Vāyuvaṭa (modern Vayad). All these V1s were
special worshipers of Vāyu at his prāsāda-s that were once prominent in
the region and the rite we perform takes its form in their teachings.  
V: “It is indeed rather remarkable that even today we have nearly
forgotten remnants of the old cult at these key cultic centers, like the
Vāyu temples in Lāṭa and the Vitteśa near a step-well in their vicinity,
or the images of Nalakūbara at Gopagiri and the fragment of the old
Yakṣarāṭ-prāsāda at Kauśāmbī.”

I.s: “If the Yakṣa is good to us, may be some day we shall visit those
cultic centers to revive our connection. To continue, the ritualist then
salutes his teachers: ‘oṃ gurubhyo namaḥ \|‘. The spot of the rite
should be to the north of the trunk of the said tree for indeed the
northern line is where Vāyu, Vitteśa and Bhava, all deities of the rite,
are stationed. The ritualist begins by uttering the yajuṣ:  
iṣé tvorjé tvā vāyávaḥ sthopāyávaḥ stha devó vaḥ savitā́ prā́rpayatu
śréṣṭhatamāya kármaṇe \|  
For vigor you; for nourishment you; the Vāyu-s abide, the approachers
abide. Let the god Savitṛ set you in motion for the most excellent
ritual.

Vrishchika, here you may note the multiplicity of the Vāyu-s reminiscent
of the Aeolian plurality seen among our yavana cousins. Then he stands
up and recites the following ṛk-s:  
stóma-trayastriṁśe bhúvanasya patni vívasvad vāte abhí no gṛṇāhi \|  
ghṛtávatī savitar ā́dhipatyaiḥ páyasvatī rántir ā́śā no astu \|\|  
dhruvā́ diśā́ṃ viṣṇupatny ághorāsyéśānā sáhaso yā́ manótā \|  
bṛhaspátir mātaríśvotá vāyúḥ saṃdhuvānā́ vā́tā abhí no gṛṇantu \|\|  
viṣṭambhó divó dharúṇaḥ pṛthivyā́ asyéśānā jágato víṣṇupatnī \|  
viśvávyacā iṣáyantī súbhūtiḥ śivā́ no astv áditir upásthe \|\|  
O you of the 33-fold stoma, lady of the world, with winds set in motion
by Vivāsvān, may you be gracious to us.  
Rich in ghee, O Savitṛ, through your overlordship, may the generous
space be rich in milk for us.  
Firm among the quarters, wife of Viṣṇu, the benign \[lady\], the strong
queen of all, the desirable one;  
Bṛhaspati, Matariśvan, Vāyu, the Vāta-s blowing in unison, may all be
gracious to us.  
Stabilizer of the sky, supporter of the earth, ruling this world, wife
of Viṣṇu.  
Encompassing all space, invigorating all, prosperous, may the goddess
Aditi be auspicious to us in her lap.

He then marks out a square area on the ground with the side equal to his
full arm’s length and sweeps it clean. Within it he marks out another
square region with a side equal to his span. He does this with the sphya
(the wooden sword) while chanting the formula:  
ástabhnād dyā́m ṛṣabhó antárikṣam ámimīta varimā́ṇam pṛthivyā́ ā́sīdad viśvā
bhúvanāni samrā́ḍ víśvet tā́ni váruṇasya vratā́ni \|\|  
The bull has stabilized the sky \[and\] the atmosphere; he has measured
the circumference of the earth; he has set him in all worlds as the
emperor. All these are Varuṇa’s laws.

He then digs out a cuboidal excavation corresponding to the central
smaller square. While doing so he recites the yajuṣ:  
víṣṇoḥ krámo ‘si víṣṇoḥ krāntám asi víṣṇor víkrāntam asi \| námo mātré
pṛthivyái mā́hán mātáram pṛthivī́m̐ him̐siṣam mā́ \| mā́ṃ mātā́ pṛthivī́ him̐sīt
\|\|  
You are the stepping of Viṣṇu; you are the step of Viṣṇu; you are the
stride of Viṣṇu. Salutation to mother Earth; may I not harm mother
Earth; may mother Earth not harm me.

The he fills the sruc with ghee using the the sruva and pours out the
ghee into excavation uttering the yajuṣ:  
vāyáve tvā váruṇāya tvā nírṛtyai tvā rudrā́ya tvā svāhā \| vā́yo vī́hi
stokā́nām \|\|  
For you Vāyu; for you Varuṇa; for you Nirṛti; for you Rudra, hail! O
Vāyu, taste the drops!

He then fills the sruc again with milk pours it into the excavation
uttering the incantation:  
vásur vásupatir híkam ási\| kṣatrā́ṇāṃ kṣatrápatir asi \| áti divás pāhi
\| vaiśravaṇāya svāhā\|\|  
You are indeed rich, the lord of riches. You are the the king of the
kings. From the heavenly realm protect us. To Vaiśravaṇa hail.”

Indrasena then brought out a bronze image of a chameleon and showed it
to Vrishchika and explained further: “The ritualist should have such a
bronze image of a chameleon, which as you know is the special animal of
the Yakṣapati. Alternatively, he may have a metal plate with the image
of a chameleon etched on it. He deposits it in the excavation for the
rite and may reuse it over and over, each time he performs the rite. He
takes up the image reciting the following incantation:  
iyaṃ varṇagodhā vaiśravaṇa-rūpā bahuvarṇikā \| tirodhā ‘si \|
hiraṇyavaktro ‘si vaiśravaṇo ‘si \| kṣatraṃ kṣatraṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ \|
mahārājāya svāhā \|\|  
This chameleon of many colors is the form of Vaiśravaṇa. You are the
camouflaged one. You are the golden-cheeked one; you are Vaiśravaṇa.
Kingly power, kingly power \[is that of\] Vaiśravaṇa. Hail to the great
king!

He then deposits the chameleon in the excavation and with the last
mantra of the above he pours out ghee from the sruva on to image. He
then covers up the image by filling the excavation. To the north of the
square he sets up a platform with a silk cloth on it. On that he should
place an ornate bronze jar with a lid. He should thereafter invoke Vāyu
and his wife Śivā in the jar and offers them water for arghya and pādya
and incense with the following incantation of Mārkaṇḍeya:  
vāyum āvāhayiṣyāmi sarvagaṃ dīptatejasam \|  
deva vāyo tvam abhy ehi sarva-bhūta-jagat-priya \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke Vāyu of blazing splendor, who can go anywhere. O Vāyu,
dear to all beings and the world, you must come here. Please accept this
arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

śivām āvāhayiṣyāmi vāyoḥ patnīṃ prabhāvatīm \|  
śive ‘bhy ehi mahābhāge varade kāmarūpiṇī \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke Śivā of great luster, the lady of Vāyu. O highly
distinguished goddess Śivā, who can assume any form, the boon-giver,
come here. Please accept…

He then places an image of Kubera inside the jar. The image should
ideally be fashioned generally following the teaching in this regard of
the Bhārgava Mārkaṇḍeya to Vajra, the great-grandson of Kṛṣṇa, the king
of Indraprastha: The image of the wealth-giver Kubera should be painted
dark green, i.e., the color of a lotus-leaf. He should be shown as being
borne by a naras yakṣa. He should have all kinds of golden ornaments
with necklaces resting on his belly. He should be shown wearing a
beautiful cloak. He should have four hands and one of his eyes should be
yellow. He must have two fangs in his mouth, and a mustache and beard on
his face. His head is adorned with a jeweled crown. On his left lap, his
wife, the beautiful, boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi should be comfortably
seated. She should be shown with two hands. One of them should be shown
hugging the Mahārāja and the other should display a jewel-pot. In one of
his left hands he should be shown holding a jeweled vessel and a
gold-spitting mongoose in the other. In his two right hands Kubera
should be shown with a mace and a śakti missile. Beside him there should
be his dhvaja with the lion-emblem. A palanquin should be shown near his
feet and his treasure-chests should be shown beside him in the form of a
conch and a lotus filled with treasures.

If he cannot obtain such an image, any other image that is properly made
might be used. However, he must use the above teaching of Mārkaṇḍeya for
the dhyāna of the great Yakṣa because if he does so he obtains wealth.
Mārkaṇḍeya gives the following symbolism for the image: The lord should
be seen as the embodiment of all arthaśāstra-s. It is only by the
institutes of arthaśāstra-s does any endeavor of a living-being exist,
as was taught by Cāṇakya who devised the overthrow of the barbarous
Macedonians. Kubera’s śakti weapon stands for royal power and his gadā
represents daṇḍa-nīti. Goddess Ṛddhi represents a full worldly life. The
jeweled vessel in her hand is the receptacle of good qualities. The
kingdom over which the Yakṣapati rules is the body itself. The lotus and
the conch are the reservoirs of all treasures in nature from which
wealth perpetually flows. His lion flag is desire. Hence, he is known as
Kāmeśvara in the Yajurveda. His two fangs are the reward and the
punishment that he metes out. He who mediates thus has Kubera dwell in
him.

Having placed the image of the Rājarāja in the jar he invokes him and
his retinue and offers them worship with the following incantations:  
yākṣān āvāhayiṣyāmi dhānādhyakṣa-samanvitān \|  
āyāntu varadā yakṣās trailokya-viditā mama \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the yakṣa-s together with the lord of wealth. Let the
yakṣa-s renowned in the 3 worlds come to me giving boons. Please accept
this arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

bhadrām āvāhayiṣyāmi dhanādhipati-sundarīṃ \|  
ehi ṛddhi mahādevi varade kāma-rūpiṇī \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the lucky one, the beautiful lady of the lord of wealth.
Come, O great boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi of much desired form. Please
accept…

aham āvāhayiṣyāmi tvām eva nalakūbaram \|  
samabhy ehi mahābhāga dhanadasya+ātmasaṃbhava \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall verily invoke you O Nalakūbara. May you, O fortunate one born of
Dhanada, come here. Please accept…

aham āvāhayiṣyāmi śibikāṃ paramāyatām \|  
śibike tvam ihā ‘bhy ehi sarva-sattva-sukhaṅkari \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the wide palanquin of Kubera. O palanquin who generates
all good and pleasures may you come here. Please accept…

naram āvāhayiṣyāmi narādhipati-vāhanam \|  
nara śīghraṃ tvam ‘bhy ehi tathā nṛpatināyaka \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the Naras yakṣa who is the vehicle of the king
\[Kubera\]. O Naras may you quickly come here, you have the king as your
lord \[Kubera\]. Please accept…

śaṅkham āvāhayiṣyāmi nidhi-pravaram uttamam \|  
śīghraṃ śaṅkha tvam abhy ehi dhānādhipati-vallabha \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the conch, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you,
O conch, quickly come here, the one dear to the lord of wealth. Please
accept…

padmam āvāhayiṣyāmi nidhi-pravaram uttamam \|  
padmaṃ śīghraṃ tvam abhy ehi mahāvibhava-kāraka \|  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām \|\|  
I shall invoke the lotus, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you,
O lotus, quickly come here producing great prosperity. Please accept…

Then he offers flowers, honey and bhakṣaṇa-s to the image of Kubera with
the famous incantation from the Taittirīya-āraṇyaka:  
rājādhirājāya prasahyasāhine \| namo vayam vaiśravaṇāya kurmahe \| sa me
kāmān kāmakāmāya mahyam \| kāmeśvaro vaiśravaṇo dadātu \|  
kuberāya vaiśravaṇāya \| mahārājāya namaḥ \|\|

He should thereafter make the triple-arghya offerings as ordained by the
gāyatrī-s of Vaikhānasa-s:  
rāja-rājāya vidmahe dhanādhyakṣāya dhīmahi \| tan no rājā pracodayāt
\|\|  
rudra-sakhāya vidmahe vaiśravaṇāya dhīmahi \| tan naḥ kuberaḥ pracodayāt
\|\|  
yakṣeśvarāya vidmahe gadā-hastāya dhīmahi \| tan no yakṣaḥ pracodayāt
\|\|

Then he offers bali to Dhaneśa and Nalakūbara meditating upon them
traversing the heavens in the Puṣpaka space-station made by the god
Tvaṣtṛ which is alluded to in the mantra. This is as per the
Aruṇa-ketuka-vidhi with the incantations:  
adbhayas tirodhā’jāyata \| tava vaiśravaṇas sadā \| tirodhehi sapatnān
naḥ \| ye apo ‘śnanti kecana \| tvāṣṭrīṃ māyāṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ \| ratham̐
sahasra-vandhuram \| puruś-cakram̐ sahasrāśvam \| āsthāyāyāhi no balim \|
yasmai bhūtāni balim āvahanti \| dhanañ-gāvo-hasti-hiraṇyam-aśvān \|
asāma sumatau yajniyasya \| śriyam bibhrato ‘nnamukhīṃ virājam \|
sudarśane ca krauñce ca \| maināge camahāgirau \| śata-dvāṭṭāragamantā
\| sam̐hāryan nagaraṃ tava \| iti mantrāḥ \| kalpo’ta ūrdhvam \| yadi
balim̐ haret \| hiraṇyanābhaye vitudayekauberāyāyam baliḥ \|
sarvabhūtadhipataye nama iti \| atha balim̐ hṛtvopatiṣṭheta \| kṣatraṃ
kṣatraṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ \| brāhmaṇā vayam̐ smaḥ \| namaste astu mā māhim̐sīḥ
\|\|

After that he makes bali offerings to the rakṣa-s, yakṣa-s and yakṣī-s
in the entourage of Kubera with:  
miśra-vāsasaḥ kauberakā rakṣo-rājena preṣitāḥ \|  
grāmam̐ sa-jānayo gacchantīchanto paridākṛtān \|\|  
Wearing mixed clothes the agents of Kubera, directed by the king of the
rakṣa-s together with the \[yakṣī\] consorts go as they please to the
villages granting protection.

There after he sets up a sthaṇḍila in the square he has marked out. He
strews darbha grass with the shoots facing north. He installs the fire
therein from his aupāsana or āhavanīya altar or kindles it afresh. He
recites this ṛk:  
vaiśvānaraṃ kavayo yajñiyāso ‘gniṃ devā ajanayann ajuryam \|  
nakṣatram pratnam aminac cariṣṇu yakṣasyādhyakṣaṃ taviṣam bṛhantam
\|\|  
The gods, the poets of the ritual, generated the unaging Agni
Vaiśvānara,  
the primordial star, wandering but not violating \[the natural law\],
the mighty and great lord of the yakṣa.

He makes an oblation of ghee with: agnaye vaiśvānarāya svāhā \| idam
agnaye vaiśvānarāya na mama \|

If he is a purohita performing it on behalf of a yajamāna other than
himself, like at the temple it would be done with the V3, then the
yajamāna must recite the tyāga-mantra ‘idam…na mama‘ as the oblation is
offered. Then he recites:  
dhātā́ rātíḥ savitédáṃ juṣantām prajā́patir nidhipátir no agníḥ \|  
tváṣṭā víṣṇuḥ prajáyā saṁrarāṇó yájamānāya dráviṇaṃ dadhātu \|\|  
May Dhatṛ the giver, may Savitṛ, rejoice in this \[oblation\],
Prajāpati, the lord of treasures, and Agni, for us; may Tvaṣtṛ and Viṣṇu
generously give wealth with offspring to the ritualist.

He makes an oblation of ghee with: devebhyaḥ svāhā \| idam devebhyo na
mama \|

He then prepares for the core oblations of the yajña by deploying the
nigada recitation as in the vaidika rite calling upon the god Agni who
is of the brāhmaṇa-s and the Bhārata-s to bring the gods of the rite for
receiving the oblations:  
oṃ agne mahām̐ asi brāhmaṇa bhārata \| deveddho manviddha ghṛtāhavanaḥ
praṇīr yajñānāṃ rathīr adhvarāṇām atūrto hotā tūrṇir havyavāṭ \| tvaṃ
paribhūr asy ā vaha devān yajamānāya \|\| vāyuṃ niyutvantam ā vaha \|
kuberaṃ vaiśravaṇam ā vaha \| rudram paśupatim ā vaha \| devām̐ ājyapām̐ ā
vaha \|\|

He then offers in the northern side of the sthaṇḍila with the sruva:  
prajāpatye svāhā \| idam prajāpatye na mama \|\|

He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ \|‘ and starts filling he sruc and as
he does so he recites:  
tava vāyav ṛtaspate tvaṣṭur jāmātar adbhuta \|  
avāṃsy ā vṛṇīmaho3m \|\|  
Vāyu, lord of the natural law, of wondrous form, Tvaṣṭṛ’s son-in-law,
your protection we choose.

Then he recites:  
pra vāyum acchā bṛhatī manīṣā  
bṛhadrayiṃ viśvavāraṃ rathaprām \|  
dyutadyāmā niyutaḥ patyamānaḥ  
kaviḥ kavim iyakṣasi prayajyo3m \|\|  
vau3ṣaṭ \| idaṃ vāyave niyutvate na mama \|\|  
\[Our\] great meditation (goes) forth to Vāyu; with great wealth and all
that is excellent, he fills his chariot; on the brilliant path, master
of horse-teams, you the poet seeks to reach the poet \[i.e. the
hymn-composing vipra\], you who are worshiped at the forefront of the
ritual.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the
tyāga-mantra. He makes the oblation facing whichever direction the wind
blows at the time he is reciting the this mantra. He utters the call
‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ \|‘ and starts filling he sruc and as he does so he
recites:  
rāyas poṣāyāyuṣā tvā nidhīśo bhrātṛvyāṇāṃ mahasāṃ cādhipatyo3m \|  
\[I invoke you\] for riches and prosperity with a long life. The lord of
wealth \[is worshiped\] for taking over the glory of our rivals and for
overlordship.

This peculiarly-formed mantra is that of the old Jambhala-vit
Vaikhānasa, the master of divine rituals. Then he recites:  
dūre pūrṇena vasati dūra ūnena hīyate \|  
mahad yakṣaṃ bhuvanasya madhye  
tasmai baliṃ rāṣṭrabhṛto bharanto3m \|\|  
vau3ṣaṭ \| idaṃ kuberāya vaiśravaṇāya na mama \|\|  
In fullness he dwells in the distance, is left behind in distance on
diminishing;  
A mighty Yakṣa is in the center of the universe:  
to him the tributary rulers bring tribute.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the
tyāga-mantra. I should mention that this is the mysterious mantra is of
the Bhṛgu-s by knowing which one becomes the complete Jambhala-vit. It
was taught to me by Somakhya on a dark new moon night as we were
wandering in a beautiful mountainous region. This completed my learning
of the tradition and conferred on me the ability to perform this ritual.
The thing which dwells in distance in full and then diminishes is an
allusion to the moon. This disappearance of the moon is in turn
indicative of tirodhā, the famed concealing power of the Yakṣa. He then
utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ \|‘, starts filling he sruc and as he
does so he recites:  
kad rudrāya pracetase mīḷhuṣṭamāya tavyase \|  
vocema śantamaṃ hṛdo3m \|\|  
What might we say to Rudra, the wise, the most generous and mighty one;
what might we say that is most pleasing to his heart?

upa te stomān paśupā ivākaraṃ  
rāsvā pitar marutāṃ sumnam asme \|  
bhadrā hi te sumatir mṛḷayattamā  
‘thā vayam ava it te vṛṇīmaho3m \|\|  
vau3ṣaṭ \| idaṃ rudrāya paśupataye na mama \|\|  
Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you.  
Grant your favor to us, father of the Marut-s,  
for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful.  
It is indeed your aid that we choose. \[translation after Geldner\]

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation, then utters the tyāga-mantra
and then touches water.

Then with the sruva he utters the following mantra-s and makes an
offering of ghee at each svāhā followed by the tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na
mama‘:  
indraḥ svāhā \| marutaḥ svāhā \| sarva-nidhido ratna-dhātumān svāhā \|
tirodhā bhūḥ svāhā \| tirodhā bhuvaḥ svāhā \| tirodhā svaḥ svāhā \|
tirodhā bhūr-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ svāhā \| kāmeśvarāya svāhā \| kuberāya svāhā \|
dhanyāya svāhā \| vaiśravaṇāya svāhā \| yakṣa-rājāya svāhā \|\|

He then initiates the expiatory sviṣṭakṛt-yāga by reciting the mantra of
my ancestor Vasuśruta Ātreya:  
oṃ juṣṭo damūnā atithir duroṇa  
imaṃ no yajñam upa yāhi vidvān \|  
viśvā agne abhiyujo vihatyā  
śatrūyatām ā bharā bhojanāno3m \|\|  
As the satisfied lord of the house and the guest in the home,  
journey to this our yajña, the learned god,  
Having demolished all assaults, O Agni,  
bring here the sustenance of our enemies.

He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ \|‘ and fills the sruc. He then
recites:  
agniṃ sviṣṭakṛtam ayāḍ vāyor niyutvataḥ priyā dhāmāny ayāṭ kuberasya
vaiśravaṇasya priyā dhāmāny ayāḍ rudrasya paśupateḥ priyā dhāmāny ayāḍ
devānām ājyapānāṃ priyā dhāmāni yakṣad agner hotuḥ priyā dhāmāni yakṣat
svaṃ mahimānam āyajatāmejyā iṣaḥ kṛṇotu so adhvarā jātavedā juṣtām̐ havir
mārjālyo mṛjyate sve damūnāḥ kavi-praśasto atithiḥ śivo naḥ \|
sahasra-śṛṅgo vṛṣabhas tad ojā viśvām̐ agne sahasā prāsy anyān vau3ṣaṭ
\|\|

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the offering from the sruc and utters: ‘idam
agnaye sviṣṭakṛte na mama\|‘ The terminal mantra of the sviṣṭakṛt-yāga
is also composed by my ancestors Budha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya:  
Fit to be kindled, he is kindled in his own (house) as master of the  
house, praised by poets, our auspicious guest.  
A thousand-horned bull having its virility,  
O Agni, in might you excel all others.

Then he offers a homa to the Vināyaka-s, Skanda, and other anuyāyin-s of
Rudra which include the Yakṣapati himself so that the yajamāna-s rite
might be successful and he and his family not be harmed. He utters the
tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na mama‘ after each svāhā call:  
Om̐ śālakaṭaṅkaṭāya vināyakāya svāhā \| kuṣmāṇḍarājaputrāya vināyakāya
svāhā \| usmitāya vināyakāya svāhā \| devayajanāya vināyakāya svāhā \|
vimukhāya svāhā \| śyenāya svāhā \| bakāya svāhā \| yajñāya svāhā \|
kalahāya svāhā \| bhīrave svāhā \| yajñavikṣepiṇe svāhā \|
kulaṅgāpamārāya svāhā \| yūpakeśyai svāhā \| sūkarakroḍyai svāhā \|
umāyai haimavatyai svāhā \| jambhakāya svāhā \| vīrūpākṣāya svāhā \|
lohitākṣāya svāhā \| vaiśravaṇāya svāhā \| mahārājāya svāhā \|
mahāsenāya svāhā \| kumārāya svāhā \| viśākhāya svāhā \| śākhāya svāhā
\| nejameṣāya svāhā \| ṣaṣṭhyai svāhā \| rudrāya mahādevāya svāhā \|\|

He then touches water. Thereafter he takes up some grain and throws it
in the south-west direction for the rakṣa-s uttering: ‘rakṣasām bhago
‘si \|‘ Then he touches water again and takes up the darbha grass and
casts it into the fire reciting:  
Om̐ sáṃ barhír aṅktām̐ havíṣā ghṛténa sám ādityáir vásubhiḥ sáṃ marúdbhiḥ
sám índro viśvádevebhir aṅktāṃ divyáṃ nábho gacchatu yát svā́hā \|\| idaṃ
divyāya nabhase na mama \| rudrāya paśupatye svāhā \| idaṃ rudrāya
paśupataye na mama\|\|  
Auspicious \[is\] the grass smeared with offerings and ghee. Let Indra
together with the Āditya-s, the Vasu-s, Marut-s, and the Viśvedeva-s go
(having been honored). Let svāhā-offerings rise to the heavenly ether.
Hail to Rudra Paśupati.

Then he recites the following to conclude the yajña with the recitation
of Agastya:  
agne naya supathā rāye asmān  
viśvāni deva vayunāni vidvān \|  
yuyodhy asmaj juhurāṇam eno

He finally recites the śānti-mantra-s: ‘tac chamyor…‘ and ‘namo vāce yā

his family drink some of the honey offered to the yakṣa and he

toothbrush, sandals and umbrella along with a hefty ritual fee if he is

V: “I must remark that the final homa has a set of rather remarkable
deities. Perhaps we are seeing the worship of Vārāhī for the first time
in Sūkarakroḍī. I also wonder if Yūpakeśī is some early version of
Cāmuṇḍā. Beyond that I’m most inspired by this account of the rite and
feel that I have become a Jambhala-jñā”

Why did great sage Pāṇini compose the Aṣṭādhyāyī? There were probably
multiple reasons but often you hear people say that he wanted to give a
complete description of the Sanskrit language. That was probably one of
his reasons but was it the central reason or the most important driver
of his endeavor. From his own language and the evolution of the language
to his times we can see that the Vedic register of Sanskrit was well
known but already largely a thing of history in terms of being a spoke
language. Yet, Pāṇini devotes an enormous amount of effort in describing
it accurately and it still forms the foundation of our effort to
understand the earliest words of our ārya ancestors. Thus, understanding
the Vedic language so that we can properly understand the religion of
our ārya ancestors and perform rituals as enjoined in the śruti was the
major reason for Pāṇini-s effort. This indeed is acknowledged by his
great commentator Patañjali. One who is well-acquainted with the śruti
also realizes that the ārya-s conceived this linguistic framework for
understanding the śruti and performing the rituals enjoined by it as
having a deeper significance — it offered an means of apprehending the
nature of the deva-s and understanding the universe. Hence, the great
Aṅgiras Dirghatamas auccāthya states in the śruti:

ṛco akṣare parame vyoman  
yasmin devā adhi viśve niṣeduḥ \|  
yas tan na veda kim ṛcā kariṣyati  
ya it tad vidus ta ime sam āsate \|\| RV1.164.39

In the syllable of the ṛc set in the highest world,  
therein all the gods have taken residence,  
he who doesn’t know that what can he do with the ṛc?  
verily only they who know can sit together \[in this ritual session\].

It was with such considerations in mind that the sages Pāṇini and
Patañjali composed their works. Thus, their works, which aimed at
developing a certain comprehensiveness of the framework from as small as
set of foundational axioms and with as much internal consistency as
possible, never lost focus on its relationship with the “root”, i.e. the
śruti.

Just as Pāṇini is for the ārya-s, Euclid is to their yavana cousins. His
geometric system was in many ways parallel to the vyākaraṇa of Pāṇini.
Like the work of Pāṇini it served as the framework of knowledge at large
among the yavana-s, but what was the central reason for its composition?
In the modern Occident which considers Euclid as one of the elements of
their intellectual undergirding this is either completely ignored or
wrongly stated as being the need to compose a comprehensive secular
geometric text. However, we hear from Euclid’s great commentator, a sage
in his own right, Proclus, that the reason was to ultimately develop a
geometric framework to understand the “roots” (rhizomata) of existence.
These were first expounded by Empedocles in his verse:

And first the fourfold root of all things hear!–  
White gleaming Zeus, life-bringing Hera, Aidoneus,  
And Nestis whose tears bedew mortality.

Empedocles identified the “roots” with the four deities Zeus (the fiery
element= Skt: agni), Hera (the gaseous element= Skt:vāyu), Aidoneus (the
solid element= Skt: pṛthivī) and Nestis (the liquid element= Skt:ap).
One may compare the initial part of the Empedoclean system with the
proto-Sāṃkhya system described in the upaniṣat of the Taittirīya-s.

Plato, who came after Empedocles, incorporated these “roots” into his
theory of knowledge as “stoicheia”, which literally mean letters of the
alphabet. This hints a parallel to the ārya usage that might lurk behind
Plato’s stoicheia because indeed the akṣara-s, the Sanskrit equivalent
of stoicheia, are at the foundation of the Hindu system as encapsulated
by Pānini in his Māheśvara-sūtrāṇi. However, the sense in which Plato
constructed his stoicheia was not by using linguistic analogs but by
using geometric ones. He chose for this purpose the only regular solids
that can be inscribed in a sphere — i.e [the 5 Platonic
solids](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/from-plato-to-euler-and-back/).
Plato is said to have learned of these from his predecessors like
Pythagoras and his mathematical interlocutor Theaetetus. He incorporated
them into an elaborate geometric “atomism” wherein the the fiery element
was the tetrahedron, the solid element was the cube, the gaseous element
was the octahedron, the stuff of the universe as a whole was the
dodecahedron and the liquid element was the icosahedron. However, as his
polyhedral system had 5 solids his system ultimately had to break away
from the 4 element system of the old yavana-s and converge towards the 5
element system of the ārya-s.

Plato’s polyhedra may be seen as “molecules” because beneath them there
lay his true atomic entities namely the
![30-60-90](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=30-60-90&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the
![45-45-90](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=45-45-90&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
right triangles (the 3 angles of this triangle are given in degrees).
Two of these combined to give the equilateral triangle and the square
which in turn constituted the four elemental polyhedra (sort of like the
dvayāṇu theory of Akṣapāda Gautama). So in a process like the boiling of
water into the gaseous state under the influence of the fire tetrahedron
Plato saw the water icosahedron break down into equilateral triangles
and reconstitute gaseous octahedra. In his system the solid cube had to
keep out of these of inter-conversions. Aristotle was uncomfortable with
this but the later Platonists including Proclus saw this a genuine
feature of the solid element. Proclus explained it by stating that the
solid element might be subdivided in interaction with the other two but
does not ultimately transform.

In any case, for Proclus the foundation of understanding was based in
mathematics. Indeed, he says that it “purifies and elevates the soul
even as the goddess Athena dispersed mist obscuring the intellectual
light of understanding.” Hence, it was critical to have a complete
theory from few starting axioms to construct the 5 Platonic solids that
form the basis of existence. This, he says, is the ultimate objective of
Euclid — a complete theory from axioms to construct the Platonic solids.
In support of this understanding one may note that the key constructions
of the Platonic solids come in the last book of the *Elements* of
Euclid. As per Proclus, Euclid was a Platonist who had studied with
associates and students of Plato such as Philippus and Theaetetus before
composing his treatise. Now the tetrahedron and cube are easy to
construct from equilateral triangles and squares. The octahedron is
slightly more involved by is also quite easily achieved as a equilateral
bipyramid on a square base. However, the dodecahedron and the
icosahedron are much more of a challenge. It is this context we
encounter the “culmination of Euclid” in the form of the famous
pentagon-hexagon-decagon identity of Euclidean geometry. Below we shall
journey through this identity, and note its proof and how it specifies
the icosahedron. Once, we have an icosahedron we can construct the
dodecahedron as its dual.

[![penta_hexa_deca](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca.png)Figure

Consider a regular pentagon, hexagon and decagon inscribed within the
same circle (Figure 1). Let their sides be ![P, H,
D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C+H%2C+D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Then, what is the relationship between their sides? The answer to this
is provide by Euclid in his *Elements*, Book 13, Proposition 10:

**The pentagon-hexagon-decagon identity(
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))**:
*If an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle, then the square on
the side of the pentagon equals the sum of the squares on the sides of
the hexagon and the decagon inscribed in the same circle.*

[![penta_hexa_deca_BKH](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca_bkh.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca_bkh.png)Figure
2

Alternatively, if the sides of a regular pentagon, hexagon and decagon
respectively form the hypotenuse, greater and smaller legs of a right
triangle then their circumcircles are congruent (Figure 2).

Now, the the proof for this as given by Euclid is not entirely obvious
and, at least to us, it is unclear if he even gave a complete proof for
it. Nevertheless, we can prove it using all the material he has
described up to that point and the commentary of Proclus. For the proof
one needs to first define that special ratio known as the Golden ratio
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):  
![\\phi^2=\\phi+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%5E2%3D%5Cphi%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Since this is a quadratic equation it has two roots. We call the larger
one of these ![\\phi \\approx
1.618...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi+%5Capprox+1.618...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and by definition the smaller one is
![\\tfrac{1}{\\phi}=\\phi-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cphi%7D%3D%5Cphi-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Proclus tells us that it was revealed to the Pythagoreans by the Muse
goddess who came to them. He then says that Plato recognized its
importance and made conjectures on them which his mathematician student
Eudoxus then proved using geometry. It is evidently this material of
Eudoxus that is presented by Euclid — for example, he provides a means
to construct
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
without calling it that in Book 2 of his *Elements*. Now this ratio has
a special relationship to the isosceles triangle with angles
![\\tfrac{2\\pi}{5}, \\tfrac{2\\pi}{5},
\\tfrac{\\pi}{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
in such a triangle the ratio of either of the congruent sides to its
base is
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This Golden ratio triangle is central to the proof of the
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity.

Figure 3 depicts the construction required for our proof. We observe
that the said pentagon of our identity is in green, the hexagon in blue
dotted segments and the decagon in red. The radius of their circumcircle
is the same as the side of the hexagon
![H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From the construction we see two instances of the above-mentioned Golden
ratio triangles: One with sides ![H, H,
D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2C+H%2C+D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

2x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%2C+D%2C+2x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From those triangles we can write the below:

![\\dfrac{P^2}{4}=D^2-x^2\\\\\[10 pt\]
\\dfrac{P^2}{4}=H^2-(H-x)^2=2Hx-x^2\\\\\[10 pt\]

If one were to assume the theorem of Brahmagupta or Ptolemaios regarding
the diagonals and sides of a cyclic quadrilaterals one can prove it by
an alternative path. We leave this for the geometrically inclined reader
to work out.

[![icosahedron_P\_H_D](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/icosahedron_p_h_d.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/icosahedron_p_h_d.png)Figure

The remarkable discovery of the yavana-s was the relationship of this
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity to the icosahedron. Consider the icosahedron in Figure 4. By
definition all edges of the icosahedron are equal and all faces are
equilateral triangles. Now, the edges of the icosahedron are congruent
to the sides of the pentagon
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity. Thus, if one constructs the circle as in Figure 4 we get the
circumcircle as in Figure 3. With this circle we can construct the sides
of the decagon
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as above, e.g.
![\\overline{PQ}=D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BPQ%7D%3DD&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in Figure 4. Then, the relationship it has to the icosahedron is that
![\\overline{AB}=\\overline{PQ}=D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BPQ%7D%3DD&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The 5 faces of an icosahedron each of which share a common edge
constitute a pentagonal pyramid. The height of this pyramid is
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4). Now, by construction the radius of the circumcircle of the
pentagonal bases of such pyramids in the icosahedron is of length
![H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. the side of the hexagon in the
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity (Figure 4;
![\\overline{BC}=H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D%3DH&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Interestingly, if we visualize the icosahedron as being made up of two
pentagonal pyramids stuck to a central band of 10 facets then the
distance between the pentagonal bases of the two pyramids is
![H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4;
![\\overline{QR}=H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BQR%7D%3DH&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)).
Thus, the planar
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity is able to describe the icosahedron in 3D space and we can use
it to construct this non-obvious Platonic solid. In order to prove this
relationship between the
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity and the above landmarks of the icosahedron we have to
effectively prove that ![\\triangle{ABC} \\cong
\\triangle{PQR}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle%7BPQR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 4). They are right triangles and their hypotenuse and legs are
respectively ![P, H,
D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C+H%2C+D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

5

In order to prove that we have first construct rectangles inside the
icosahedron like the one shown in Figure 5. From the above Golden
triangle (Figure 3) and its relationship to the pentagon (used in the
compass and straight-edge construction of the pentagon; [see this
note](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/some-meanderings-among-golden-stuff/))
we can see that such an internal rectangle of the icosahedron will be a
Golden rectangle, i.e. ratio of its non-equal sides would be
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

[![penta_hexa_deca_icosahedro](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca_icosahedro.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/penta_hexa_deca_icosahedro.png)Figure
6

We then use this rectangle to make an orthographic projection of the
icosahedral construction in Figure 4 on to a plane (Figure 6). In the
right panel of Figure 6 we see how this Golden rectangle is placed with
respect to key landmarks of the icosahedron. In the left panel we see
the actual projection of icosahedral construction in Figure 4. This
preserves the mutual relationships of ![\\triangle{ABC},
\\triangle{PQR}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D%2C+%5Ctriangle%7BPQR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
between 3D construction and the planar projection. We construct
![\\overline{XY}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BXY%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By examining this figure we observe ![\\overline{XY} \|\|
\\overline{AC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BXY%7D+%7C%7C+%5Coverline%7BAC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, ![\\angle{ACB} \\cong
\\angle{XYP}=\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7BACB%7D+%5Ccong+%5Cangle%7BXYP%7D%3D%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From this, one can show that
![\\angle{PRQ}=\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7BPRQ%7D%3D%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By the nature of the projection we preserve the equivalence of the edges
of the icosahedron such that ![\\overline{AC} \\cong
\\overline{PR}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAC%7D+%5Ccong+%5Coverline%7BPR%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, by Side-Angle-Angle test we can show ![\\triangle{ABC} \\cong
\\triangle{PQR} \\quad
\_\\blacksquare](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BABC%7D+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle%7BPQR%7D+%5Cquad+_%5Cblacksquare&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we complete our journey through one of the profound aspects of
Euclidean space — a thread passing through its defining feature the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya, the three regular polygons and the regular
polyhedron, the icosahedron. When we were young, on account of our
fascination for viral capsid structures, we closely studied the geometry
of polyhedra by practical means, i.e. making them out of paper. It was
in course of this we learnt of the
![P.H.D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.H.D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
identity. We were able to practically confirm that for ourselves based
on our models. However, it took us some time before we actually
apprehended the proof.

**Entry 1; kāmāturā, year Siddhārthin of the first cycle:** Indrasena
departed for grad school last week and I am feeling a bit of loneliness
of a kind I did not even feel when Lootika left. In the midst of all
this I did not even register the fact that I have completed my basic
medical degree in good time. But my dear agrajā’s words come to mind
that the true prowess of a person becomes apparent only when they prove
themselves all on their own against hostile forces. I was also reminded
of her admonishing me that I was way too swayed by sentiments of
attachment and eros. But sometimes I feel concerned that she might have
taken that too far — she has totally lost all contact with Somakhya for
an year now. At least now Somakhya has Indrasena beside him but my
pretty agrajā is all by herself battling hostile mleccha-s in the quest
for glory.

Thankfully, due to the favors of the gods I am likely to get any
internship I would like, but that is just practice. It goes without
saying that I would be pursuing experimental medicine for that was what
I always supposed to be doing. In any case, I have got a waiver to
already start accompanying and assisting my senior Vidrum on the rounds
till my program formally opens. I guess he harbors some edginess towards
me right from school days but still tolerates me because of all the
curricular help I have rendered him over the years and his friendship
with Lootika and Somakhya. One of my reasons for writing this entry was
an interesting case that confronted us last week — it brought a closure
to me in an unexpected way. A young mleccha man arrived with acute
cardiac symptoms. He had a generally culprit-free angiogram but rapidly
deteriorated and died a couple of hours after admission. Since it was an
unusual case we pursued it further for it might teach us something we
did not know. One thing which became apparent was that he did not show
any elevation of cardiac-specific troponins in the blood. However, his
cardiac muscles showed a dramatic fall of calcium ions in the
sarcoplasmic lumen a sign that his SERCA calcium pump was compromised.
Yet, it was totally normal in sequence.

An interview with his parents who was accompanied by an official of the
embassy of the said mleccha country revealed something interesting. They
were working for a NGO for the “inculcation of scientific temper among
Dalits and tribals”. I wondered what that could mean. They were full of
pride on their son and declared that he was a great genius from
childhood and a “Do it yourself” scientist. However, they said he had a
strong suicidal tendency; hence, due to certain episodes they had
brought him over from their country to stay with them for sometime and
cool off. They showed me some of his notebooks, which indicated that he
was indeed some kind of a polymath with ranging interests and insights.
Moreover, he was a DIY molecular biologist. That stirred something in me
for it reminded me of none other than myself and my sisters. The scan of
his notebook revealed that he had engineered a variant of the SERCA
inhibitory peptide phospholamban, which was effective in shutting down
SERCA in the heart. A closely analysis of his tissues revealed that it
was by means of that peptide he had sent himself to king Vaivasvata — he
thought no one would ever figure out that it was a suicide. Via Vidrum I
provided a report to his parents and the official and closed the case.

I was struck by the strangeness of all this. His death reminded me that
often a great tree grows in a jungle and then one fine day is struck
down by the indra-senā or the wrath of the pitiless Vāyu as our Iranian
cousins would have said. Thus, indeed this young man had seen many
realms of knowledge but no one knew that he had reached so deep for he
had fallen like that tree in a lonely boreal forest with no one to hear
the crash of its fall and thereby judge its great mass. But the case
brought to something more sinister to my mind: once when we were young
and had expressed our svābhāvika-siddhi-s for the first time, Lootika
and I had made the ghost of a brāhmaṇa speak. He prophesied my vīra but
at the same time mentioned that a prativīra would also emerge. But the
ghost added that we would not be affected by the prativīra for he would
attain Vivasvān’s mace-wielding son even before he could engage in a
contest with us. I realized that the individual was the prativīra and
that he had passed away just in front of my eyes. That also gave me a
signal because Indrasena had told me via the kauberī-vidyā that after
the prativīra has departed we will face the true contests of our life
even as I proceed towards the bus stop at Mlecchadigdvāravṛti.

**Entry 2; rakta, year Siddhārthin of the first cycle:** Things seemed
to precipitate by the day, as though drawn by fate, inexorably towards a
certain preferred unfolding of events things. Or at least that is how
the human mind tends to rightly or falsely pick patterns from the noise
in the background. I was part of the team attending to a trauma case
involving activists of the mandira vahīm̐ banega group who were holding a
meeting for mobilization for the reconstruction of the temple for the
Ikṣvāku heroes at Ayodhyāpuri. As they were proceeding to their office
beside the Vināyaka shrine on the Somamārga for a meeting they were
attacked by assailants who had vanished almost without a trace. The
eyewitness declared that the shots came from the snaking queue, which
was awaiting a darśana at the shrine and that the assailants created
some chaos in the line by shooting in the air and took advantage of that
to merge into the crowd and escape. Some even insisted that the
assailants wore saffron robes and were actually worshipers at the
shrine. In any case the mayhem left one of the activists with a bullet
lodged in his left clavicle. We were able to quickly stabilize his wound
and save his life. However, the secretary of the mandira vahīm̐ banega
committee had succumbed to his injuries by the time he was brought to us
and the only task we were left with was the autopsy. He had two bullets
which had entered his skull through the occipital region — one had
exited through the right frontal while the other was lodged in the
brain.

There was some discussion after the autopsy which involved one of our
seniors the resident Samikaran and Vidrum’s new friend, another resident
Marxenga Sen. They both remarked that his death was probably fully
deserved because he was there to cause trouble. They added: “After all
had the Chief Justice Shashiyabh not declared that such people do not
want the country to ever be in peace.” Duly, I did not pass the
opportunity to rile them by stating that it was not the mandira vahīm̐
banega group but their mustache-less bearded friends who were the
biggest cause of not just the country not but the world not being at
peace. They went on like a person on bhaṅga or a song playing in a loop
on how the assailants were certainly Hindu terrorists as they were
saffron-clad and visiting the temple and that it was an internal
gang-fight among the Hindu terrorists. I quickly made my exit wondering
when these might join the beards or the well-known socialist terror
movement.

Just then my mother had called me and asked me to catch sleep in the
residents’ lounge. She did not want me coming back home that night
because apparently there was an operation to apprehend Saif ad-din
as-Sullami on way between the hospital and home. She said that she would
pick me up in the morning. That name sounded vaguely familiar; so, I
looked him up and found that he was known to be a peddler of a flavor of
music called sufi-pop, which accompanied gyrating dances that were
popular with a section of the educated youth with a proclivity towards
debauchery. There was a rumor in certain circles that he was also
involved more serious stuff like using his musical outlet for love-jihad
and running a hitman service for a national and international clientele
of criminals. It was seemed that he was behind the shooting that took
place earlier in the day and had also played a big role in the UCC
riots. I wondered his men were among those who had tried to kidnap me
last year during the UCC riots.

As that scary incident flashed in my mind I took out my knife and
garala-śaṅkula and placed them on my desk. Jhilleeka had improved the
design of the garala-śaṅkula such that it was less-likely to jam as it
had done during my encounter with the marūnmatta-s. I even have a third
weapon, the śilī which Indrasena had gifted me along with the
instructions of its use. It is a small peg which can be used to impinge
on particular points that were termed marman-s in the old Hindu medical
tradition. Our ancestors held that: “mārayantīti marmāṇyucate ।”; hence,
pressing at those points with the śilī could in the least incapacitate
the attacker. These points of the old tradition are mostly a secret and
mentioned in the old medical literature. In Cerapada there is also a
legend that the twin Aśvin-s appeared on earth to teach the secrets to
their kṣatriya-s to counter their drāviḍa cousins to the east, while the
latter were favored by Bhava. I realized that one could fairly precisely
strike these marman-s by locating certain superficial blood vessels,
fascia, tendons and aponeuroses, which tradition called sīrā- māṃsa-
snāyu- and saṃdhi-marmāṇi. I had a good sense of their location from
actual anatomical examination. I also felt I was much better than my
dear agrajā in wielding these implements and could actually cause some
serious damage even if I were to be completely overwhelmed by a male
assailant. But perhaps this is only feeling arising from the human
tendency to overestimate oneself.

**Entry 3; rasa, year Siddhārthin of the first cycle:** On my way to
college I pass by a little park, which originally had a small shrine in
the middle of it. Several years ago out of curiosity Varoli and I went
to see what was there and found it to house the statue of a man called
Rasgol-bābājī. There, a woman told me that miracles could be witnessed
by praying to the said bābājī. She explained that Rasgol-bābājī had the
power of a 1000 Sai-fakīr-bābājī-s, a 100 śrī-śrī-108-bābājī-s and 10
das-ser-jigar-bābājī-s. Even as I was taking in the magnitude of the
hepatomegaly of the last of them, she exuberantly mentioned how bābājī
used to appear in her dreams to warn her of all manner of impending
disasters. She then went on to say that his student Khambhā-vālā-bābājī
was now in charge and that he would occasionally visit the park to
dispense miraculous medications that could “cure any disease”. Sometime
later I noticed that a new shrine had emerged next to that of
Rasgol-bābājī. Apparently, his successor Khambhā-vālā-bābājī had joined
his master in the abode of the buffalo-rider and was now consigned to a
samādhi beside him.

Vidrum had been informing me of the multiple cases of lead and mercury
poisoning he has been encountering in the past couple of years. We
checked the data an realized that there was indeed a significant spike.
We wondered what might be the cause for those cases as our state’s
environmental agency had given a clean-chit for our water and food
sources. The answer dawned on us with a crash yesterday. We had a
“god-man” rushed to our care by his throng of devotees. They claimed he
was under an abhicāra from his rival śūl-vālī-mātājī. They added that he
could cure himself but his symptoms were so severe that they need us to
give him some medication so that he could become stable enough to
counter the abhicāra or prepare medications for himself. He was not
cooperating constantly stating he could cure himself but was clearly in
deep agony. His cheeks were red and he was complaining that scorpions
were constantly running under his skin. Reading my name on my badge he
became delirious and started yelling that the scorpions running under
his skin had suddenly manifested a dangerous woman. Before I could even
process what happened next, one of his votaries rushed at me and started
pulling my hair while another grabbed my hand. Thankfully, Vidrum who
was beside me acted quickly and knocked out the guy who was grabbing my
hand. That gave me a breather by which time I had drawn my śilī and bore
it down on the exposed sīrāmarman on the attacker’s hand. His hand went
limp and I freed my hair and struck him again on his skull with śilī
thus making him fall. Vidrum and others signaled me to retreat as they
handled the case. The scary memory of the murder of a physician near my
school by the irate relatives of a patient flashed in my mind but in the
adrenaline rush I was feeling elated as I had never felt recently — I
had knocked out an attacker successfully with the śilī! In my
excitement, I sent off mails to Indrasena and my sisters describing the
incident and asked them not to tell my parents.

Later that day, I heard that Vidrum had referred the god-man to the
poison-control department. There the god-man’s anuyāyin-s had caused
quite a bit of trouble and took their man away after the department told
them that they had to stop him from using mercury and lead and that he
had to remain in the hospital for an attempt at chelation therapy.
Vidrum said that he was considering reporting the man to the
poison-control authorities because he believed he might be behind the
metal-poisoning cases we had seen. Out of the blue, Marxenga came to me
and started haranguing me that “right wing” types like me were the cause
of emergence of likes of that god-man. Vidrum for a change shooed her
away. He told me that the supposed holy man was a certain Gajpuṭ-bābājī,
the student and successor of the late Khambhā-vālā-bābājī. I looked him
up and realized that he ran a popular channel that was frequented by
many believing in his miraculous “medicines” for whitening the skin,
curing malignancies, diabetes and the like. Vidrum asked me regarding
his peculiar name. I explained to him that evidently he had taken it up
from a traditional kiln known as the gajapuṭa, which among other things
was used in baking mercurials. This led me to investigating his channel
and I saw that he had a show in which he described the preparation of
leaden, golden and silver rasagola-s for people to wear. There he took
elemental mercury heated it successively with the juices of garlic,
aloe, wood-sorrel, betel leaf and the triphala-s, each for the duration
of a week in his famed gajapuṭa that had lent him his name. At the end
of it he claimed that he had pacified the mercury and started handling
it with his bare hands mixing it with powdered silver. Then he squeezed
out the mercury remaining from the amalgamation and continued repeatedly
heating it with the pastes of various herbs prepared with gomūtra,
ajamūtra, nārīmūtra of a menstruating woman and milk. At the end he
arrived at an amalgam globe that he advised his devotees to wear or keep
in their mouth as a panacea for all kinds of diseases. With that it was
clear how our failed rasa-siddha had landed up in our hospital and had
probably also sent many of his votaries over too with his mercurials,
irrespective of the powers of his rival śūl-vālī-mātājī. I wait to learn
more of his fate and that of his enterprise.

**Entry 4; vi, year Siddhārthin of the first cycle:** A lecturer in the
geology department at the university called on me. He was known to
Somakhya and had been friendly with him. It was through him he had a
passing acquaintance of Lootika and me. He had with him a visitor from
Argentina. He had come to ask me if I could somehow arrange to use the
CT scanner in the hospital for scanning a rock with a fossil that he had
found at Utnoor in Telangana. I asked him for more details. He told me
that the Argentinean was an expert on such extinct reptiles and believed
that the skull he had found was notable. The Argentinean told me that he
believed it was fossil of utmost importance and a relative of the
dinosaurs. I took a closer look and could make out the partial contours
of a skull. It looked too primitive to be a dinosauromorph or a
pterosaur. I realized it might be the skull of an aphanosaur and
remarked so. The Argentinean was surprised and he said that nobody he
had encountered in India till now had known about aphanosaurs. I told
him that I immediately realized its significance because it promises to
be the first complete skull of an aphanosaur and we could test the
hypothesis of their being close to the ancestry of the greater
dinosaurian lineage. I agreed to help them with arranging the scans on
condition that they would give me a chance to study the skull too. They
agreed to include me as an author on the study. I am sure Somakhya would
be as jealous as he can ever be of me when he hears of my luck in this
regard.



This is primarily meant as an educational handout on some very basic
theorems of geometry that one might have studied in school. Some
educated adults whom we asked about these had either forgotten them or
claimed to have never studied them. Hence, we provide these here for
those who might be interested. In the below discussion all angles are in
radians unless explicitly specified otherwise.

**There are only 5 Platonic solids  
**The first question is at least as old as the times of Plato: Why are
they only 5 Platonic solids? Platonic solids are regular polyhedra, i.e.
they have all their faces as the same regular polygon. The simplest
regular polygon is an equilateral triangle. Its angle is
![\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
In order to fold a solid the sum of the angles of the polygonal faces
must be less than ![2
\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
radians because ![2
\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the sum of the angles about a point on a plane in Euclidean space.
Further, to make a solid we need at least 3 polygonal faces meet at a
vertex. Hence, with an equilateral triangle we can make solids with 3 or
4 or 5 faces meeting at a vertex, ![3 \\times \\tfrac{\\pi}{3}; 4
\\times \\tfrac{\\pi}{3}; 5\\times
\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\<2\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D%3B+4+%5Ctimes+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D%3B+5%5Ctimes+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B3%7D%3C2%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
These respectively yield the tetrahedron, the octahedron and the
icosahedron (Figure 1). With the next regular polygon, a square, we can
get 3 squares to meet at a vertex, i.e. ![3 \\times
\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This yields us a cube. Next, with a regular pentagon we can get three
pentagonal faces at vertex, i.e. ![3 \\times
\\tfrac{3\\pi}{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+%5Ctfrac%7B3%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This gives us the dodecahedron. Thus, we can have only 5 Platonic solids
in 3-dimensional space
![\_\\blacksquare](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%5Cblacksquare&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

In principle, one can join the centers of adjacent faces of regular
polyhedron to get another regular polyhedron due to their inherent
symmetry (Figure 1). Performing this operation one can also see that the
Platonic solids have a duality with another Platonic solid:
(cube-octahedron) – (tetrahedron-tetrahedron) –
(dodecahedron-icosahedron). In each dual pair there is one of the three
formed by equilateral triangle faces. Given that the duality operation
on the tetrahedron yields a congruent tetrahedron, you again will have
only 5 Platonic solids. It made a such a profound impression on me when
I first discovered this for myself as a kid that I could entirely
appreciate the profound impact the discovery of these solids
(apocryphally by Pythagoras and Theaetetus) had on Plato of yore. It
tells you some very basic thing about Euclidean space.

**The sum of the angles of a convex polygon**  
A polygon is a closed path with
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
vertices where adjacent vertices are connected by a single edge. Hence,
it follows that the polygon has
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
edges or sides as well (Figure 2). This gives our next question: what is
the sum of the angles of a polygon? The simplest polygon, the triangle,
has angles summing to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
radians in Euclidean space. Every other planar convex polygon of
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
vertices can be constructed from
![B-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles all of which share a common vertex (Figure 2). From Figure 2
it is apparent that the sum of angles of the polygon is equal to the sum
of the angles of the constituent triangles. Thus, the sum of the angles
of a convex polygon is
![(B-2)\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28B-2%29%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
radians. This result was first derived by
[Proclus](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/).

**[![polygon_triangulation](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_triangulation.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_triangulation.png)Figure

**The triangulation theorem**  
Let a convex polygon have
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
vertices and
![I](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
internal points (Figure 3). We triangulate it by connecting the internal
points to the vertices of the bounding polygon or each other without any
edge crossing over such that the whole polygon is dissected into
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles (Figure 3). We then ask: Is there are relationship between
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![I](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The answer is the triangulation theorem, which states that
![F=2I+B-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3D2I%2BB-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

**[![triangulation_theorem](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/triangulation_theorem.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/triangulation_theorem.png)Figure
3. Triangulation of a polygon.**

*Proof:*  
1) The sum of the angles of the bounding polygon (as shown above) is
![(B-2)\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28B-2%29%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
2) The sum of all the angles on a plane sharing common vertex is
![2\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
radians. Hence, the sum of the angles at all internal points is
![2I\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2I%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
the sum of the angles of all the
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
constituent triangles of the triangulation of the polygon is
![F\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From Figure 3 it can also be seen that it is
![(B-2)\\pi+2I\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28B-2%29%5Cpi%2B2I%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) ![F\\pi=(B-2)\\pi+2I\\pi; \\; \\therefore F=2I+B-2\\;\\;

**Euler’s theorem**

**[![polygon_Euler](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_euler.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_euler.png)Figure
4. Two polyhedra and the polygonal tilings derived from them.**

The above result regarding the triangulation of polygons in 2D space
Euclidean space and Plato’s discovery that only 5 regular polyhedra
exist in 3D space are both related to the sum of all the angles on plane
about a vertex being
![2\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This in turn leads to the celebrated theorem of Euler regarding
polyhedra, which while deceptively simple had to wait for 2 millennia
since Plato’s days. Consider the two polyhedra in Figure 4. The first is
a pentagonal pyramid while the second is a hexagonal prism. Let
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the number of faces,
![V](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the number of vertices and
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the number of edges of the polyhedron. For the pyramid in question we
have ![F=6; V=6;
E=10](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3D6%3B+V%3D6%3B+E%3D10&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus,
![6+6=10+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6%2B6%3D10%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For the prism in question we have ![F=8; V=12; E=18\\; \\therefore
8+12=18+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3D8%3B+V%3D12%3B+E%3D18%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+8%2B12%3D18%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
You can try this out for other polyhedra like those in Figure 1. We can
as the question: Is there a general relationship here? We observe that
always:
![F+V=E+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV%3DE%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is Euler’s theorem and and we prove it below.

*Proof:*  
1) We first reduce the 3D polyhedron to a 2D graph (Figure 4). The way
we do this is by choosing one face of the polyhedron as the bounding
polygon. We then flatten all other faces inside that bounding polygon
while still maintaining the topology of the face. This means that a
triangular face remains a triangle , a quadrilateral remains a
quadrilateral, and a
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-gon
remains a
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-gon
in the flattened 2D graph. Thus, the 2D graph is a polygonal tiling of
the selected face polygon of the starting polyhedron. This is easy to
conceive for pyramids and prisms (Figure 4). It is more complicated for
some of the Platonic polyhedra (Figure 5).

**[![polygon_Euler_reduction](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_euler_reduction.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/polygon_euler_reduction.png)Figure
5. The polygonal tilings derived from the Platonic polyhedra.**

Thus, we observe that the 2D graph retains all edges and vertices of the
starting polyhedron. However, since it is constructed by flattening all
other faces onto one face we lose that face and the resulting number of
tiling polygons is 1 less than the number of polyhedral faces. Thus, the
3D equation
![F+V=E+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV%3DE%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
becomes
![F+V=E+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV%3DE%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a 2D polygonal tilings. Proving the latter in 2D effectively results
in proving the former.

2\) We define the number
![P=F+V-E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3DF%2BV-E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a given polygon tiling. Our objective is to prove that always
![P=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We next triangulate all non-triangular polygons in a given polygon
tiling into triangles. Let us define
![T=F_t+V_t-E_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3DF_t%2BV_t-E_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the number we get from the faces, vertices and edges after
triangulation. From Figure 6 it is apparent that for each new edge we
add during triangulation we get a new face. Thus,
![P=T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3DT&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Hence, proving
![T=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will prove
![P=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

**[![triangulation_conservation](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/triangulation_conservation.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/triangulation_conservation.png)Figure
6. Conservation of
![F+V-E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV-E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
upon polygon triangulation.**

3\) Now that we have triangulated the polygonal tiling, we can apply the
triangulation theorem on the resulting graph to show
![T=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The faces
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the triangulation theorem is the same as the
![F_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in our triangulated graph; hence we can write
![F_t=2I+B-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_t%3D2I%2BB-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, the number of vertices
![V_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the triangulated graph is the sum of the number of boundary vertices
of the bounding polygon and the internal points. Thus, we get
![V_t=I+B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_t%3DI%2BB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Let
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the sum of the number of sides of all triangles in the triangulation
redundantly counting all shared edges for each triangle. Since there are
![F_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
triangles we have
![s=3F_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D3F_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be expressed in another way.
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the number of all the sides of triangles making up the boundary
polygon. The
![E_t-B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_t-B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be the remaining edges. Now they will fall on the side of 2
triangles each (e.g. see Figure 6) so to make up
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have count them twice. Thus, we can write
![s=B+2(E_t-B)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3DB%2B2%28E_t-B%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

Thus, we get:  
![B+2(E_t-B)=3F_t; \\; \\therefore
B=2E_t-3F_t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%2B2%28E_t-B%29%3D3F_t%3B+%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+B%3D2E_t-3F_t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
From the triangulation theorem and
![I=V_t-B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%3DV_t-B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we can write: ![F_t=2V_t-2B+B-2; \\therefore
F_t=2V_t-B-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_t%3D2V_t-2B%2BB-2%3B+%5Ctherefore+F_t%3D2V_t-B-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Plugging the above value of
![B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
into this we get: ![F_t=2V_t-2E_t+3F_t-2; \\; \\therefore
F_t+V_t-E_t=T=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_t%3D2V_t-2E_t%2B3F_t-2%3B+%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+F_t%2BV_t-E_t%3DT%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Since
![P=T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3DT&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
it follows that
![F+V=E+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV%3DE%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a polygonal tiling. From this it follows that:  
![F+V=E+2 \\;\\;

**Back to the Platonic solids**  
We may next ask: Given Euler’s theorem can we prove that there are only
5 Platonic solids? To answer this we need to prove two further
relationships first. For this we take into account that a Platonic
polyhedron has regular polygons as its faces and that each vertex must
necessarily belong to the same number of polygonal faces. Let
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the number of edges of the regular polygonal face of a Platonic
solid. Let
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the number of edges of meeting at any given vertex of a Platonic
solid. Let
![s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the sum of the number of sides of all polygonal faces of a Platonic
solid counting redundantly. Given that we have
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
faces in the solid, we get
![s=nF](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3DnF&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Given that we have
![V](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
vertices with
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
edges meeting at each of them we get
![s=mV](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3DmV&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Finally, we note that each edge of the polyhedron simultaneously belongs
to 2 of its polygonal faces; hence, we get
![s=2E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%3D2E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
From this we get the relationship for any Platonic solid:
![2E=nF=mV](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2E%3DnF%3DmV&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For example, in an octahedron we have ![E=12, n=3,
m=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3D12%2C+n%3D3%2C+m%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus, ![2\\times 12=3 \\times 8 = 4 \\times
6=24](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ctimes+12%3D3+%5Ctimes+8+%3D+4+%5Ctimes+6%3D24&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

From the above we have for a Platonic solid: ![F=\\tfrac{2E}{n},
V=\\tfrac{2E}{m}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3D%5Ctfrac%7B2E%7D%7Bn%7D%2C+V%3D%5Ctfrac%7B2E%7D%7Bm%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Next, we plug the above into Euler’s formula
![F+V=E+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2BV%3DE%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get:  
![\\tfrac{2E}{n}+\\tfrac{2E}{m}-E=2\\\\\[7pt\]
\\tfrac{2}{n}+\\tfrac{2}{m}-1=\\tfrac{2}{E}\\\\\[7pt\] \\therefore
\\tfrac{2}{n}+\\tfrac{2}{m}-1>0\\\\\[7pt\] \\therefore
\\tfrac{2}{n}+\\tfrac{2}{m}>1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B2E%7D%7Bn%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B2E%7D%7Bm%7D-E%3D2%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bn%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bm%7D-1%3D%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7BE%7D%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bn%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bm%7D-1%3E0%5C%5C%5B7pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bn%7D%2B%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bm%7D%3E1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

By multiplying both sides by
![nm](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the Eulerian inequality for a Platonic solid:
![2m+2n>nm](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m%2B2n%3Enm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can now use this to prove that there can be only 5 Platonic solids.
For this we should first keep in mind that to have a solid at least 3
faces should meet at a vertex; hence, minimally
![m=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We then begin with a triangular face
![n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and plug it into the Eulerian inequality:

![2m+6>3m;\\; \\therefore
m\<6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m%2B6%3E3m%3B%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+m%3C6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, for a triangle, ![m=3, 4,
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
these yield the tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron.

Next we take a square face
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![2m+8>4m;\\; \\therefore
m\<4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m%2B8%3E4m%3B%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+m%3C4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, we can only have
![m=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a square face and we get the cube.

Next we take a pentagonal face
![n=5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![2m+10>5m;\\; \\therefore
m\<\\tfrac{10}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m%2B10%3E5m%3B%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+m%3C%5Ctfrac%7B10%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, we can only have
![m=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for a pentagonal face and we get the dodecahedron.

Next we take a hexagonal face
![n=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![2m+12>6m;\\; \\therefore
m\<3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m%2B12%3E6m%3B%5C%3B+%5Ctherefore+m%3C3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Thus, we cannot get any polyhedron because
![m\<3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3C3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The same applies for any
![n>6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3E6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus there can only be 5 Platonic solids
![\_\\blacksquare](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%5Cblacksquare&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

**Tailpiece**  
While we can have infinite regular polygons, only the first 3 of them
yield a total of just 5 Platonic solids. This is a strong constraint in
3D space; thus, one would expect these Platonic ideals to occur as
reflections throughout nature. Indeed, that is the case and we may note
the following:  
1) The 4 bonds formed by the
![sp^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=sp%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
hybridized orbitals of carbon define a tetrahedron. Similarly,
phosphates
![PO_4^{3-}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=PO_4%5E%7B3-%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
such as those forming the backbone of DNA and RNA also assume a
tetrahedral geometry.
![Fe_3O_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Fe_3O_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
assumes tetrahedral crystals. Thus, the tetrahedron is a fundamental
structure of nature and life.  
2) The cube is a ubiquitous habit of crystals:
![NaCl](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=NaCl&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a good example of such.  
3) The octahedron is the habit of diamond and alum ![KAl(SO_4)\_2 \\cdot
12H_2O](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=KAl%28SO_4%29_2+%5Ccdot+12H_2O&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
4) The dodecahedron is the habit of the quasi-crystal of the
holmium–magnesium–zinc alloy. The RNA of certain nodaviruses is packed
in a dodecahedral form within their capsids.  
5) The icosahedron is famously the form of the capsids of numerous
viruses. It is also seen in some non-viral protein assemblies like those
which form the propanediol utilizing and ethanolamine utilizing
bacterial microcompartments.

In the human world, a deliberately made cube used as a gaming die and a
fixed weight was seen among the Harappan people of bronze age India.
Harappans also made regular tetrahedral weights, such as those found in
Mohenjo daro. Some believe that the occurrence of pyrites which are
found in certain places in Italy and naturally assume the forms of
cubes, dodecahedra and icosahedra might have inspired the yavana-s to
think about these solids. Among the yavana-s, we are informed by Proclus
that Pythagoras was the first to discover the Platonic solids. However,
there is no evidence that he actually knew all 5 of them and that there
were only 5. Plato mentions them in his Timaeus and by then it was known
that there are 5 of them. It is believed that Plato obtained that
knowledge from Theaetetus, his mathematical interlocutor, who is
believed to have first recognized all 5 of them. However, the evidence
for this comes from an apocryphal commentary on Euclid. Plato thought
that the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube and icosahedron corresponded to
the 4 “elements” of Greek tradition: fire, air, earth and water. He then
added that a god used the dodecahedron “for embroidering the
constellations on the whole heaven.” This is perhaps an allusion to the
12 Zodiacal constellations of the Greeks. It is also held that
Theaetetus’ explorations inspired the *Elements*, where Euclid
presumably following his successors gives these 5 Platonic polyhedra and
indicates that there are only 5 of them. Material evidence for their
recognition in the Classical world comes from the discovery of the
icosahedral dice from Ptolemaic Egypt. Further, the Romans made metal
dodecahedra and icosahedra (mostly the former), whose function remains
unknown to date as far as we know.

In Indian mathematics we are unaware of a specific mention of Platonic
solids as a group. However, we have evidence for a “ghost-lineage” of
Hindu mathematical knowledge regarding Platonic solids in the form of
beads shaped as those solids from at least the Gupta age. There is a
persistent belief among white indologists and their imitators that Hindu
mathematical tradition is a poor derivative of the Mesopotamian and
Greek traditions. However, there is absolutely no evidence for
transmission of Greek texts with knowledge of Platonic solids to Hindus
prior to the 1700s of the common era. Thus, there is no evidence that
the Indian production of Platonic solids was inspired by the Greek
textual tradition. One may point out that their emergence in Indian art
is approximately contemporaneous with their emergence in material
depictions in the Classical world. However, the Indian versions are not
used as dice as in Ptolemaic Egypt or as made like or of the large size
of their Roman counterparts. They are part of a distinctly Indian use in
jewelry. Indeed, in this regard one may point out that already in the
Sāmaññaphala-sutta-84 the tāthāgata mentions such a well-polished
octahedral bead. One may also note that some tāthāgata atomic theories
in India saw substances as being formed from their constituent molecules
by an octahedral packing. It is also notable that this style of
polyhedral beads was transmitted to Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam along
with early gold-working traditions and at least dodecahedral and
octahedral beads have been found in those regions.

On Twitter, one of our acquaintances going by the name @GhorAngirasa had
a discussion on the significance of the number 66 in śaiva tradition.
That reminded us of an unfinished article where we had noted this number
in the context of a śaiva paurāṇika narrative. This lengthy discursive
article looks at some additional features of the ancient tale of the

“fertilizing sweat” motif. Accordingly, we took this piece out of the
shelf and worked it up so that it could be minimally presentable for
publication. It provided as a pdf file because of the length and the

Among the very first programs which we wrote in our childhood was one to
generate the famous Sierpinski triangle as an attractor using the “Chaos
Game” algorithm of Barnsley. A couple of years later we returned to it
generalize it as a map in the complex plane. Consider the polynomial
equation,

![z^m+1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5Em%2B1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where integer
![m=3,4,5...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3%2C4%2C5...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The roots of this equation, ![z_j: z_1, z_2...

define the vertices of a

polygon in the complex plan. For example, if
![m=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get an equilateral triangle defined by the roots ![z_1=

With this in place the Chaos Game map is defined for a given

is one of the

roots chosen randomly with equal probability as the others in each

If

for any
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get a random-walk structure (Figure 1).

For other ![m,

Given that these attractors are fractal, they have an infinite perimeter
but occupy a finite area. Thus, one can define a common feature for the
above attractors namely “tangency” of the fractal elements, i.e., each
polygonal unit is distinct from its neighbor with the same scale-factor
but at same time makes a contact with it like a tangent. While for the
triangle and the square this definition is a bit murky, it is clearly
visible from the pentagon onward. It can be contrasted with other
fractal attractors obtained by this method where the elements overlap or
are shared. For instance for ![m=12,
r=\\tfrac{1}{2+2\\cos\\left(\\pi/6\\right)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D12%2C+r%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%2B2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cpi%2F6%5Cright%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we have the expected dodecad structure but two dodecad sub-elements are
shared by each of the adjacent elements (Figure 12).

In the above examples (Figure 2-11) we have determined for each polygon
the value of
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For
![m=5..8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D5..8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
it is the reciprocal of
![2+2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{m}\\right)=4\\cos^2\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{m}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2B2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bm%7D%5Cright%29%3D4%5Ccos%5E2%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bm%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which are known as Beraha constants (
![B_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
that appear in graph-coloring theory. However, for
![m=9..12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D9..12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
this principle clearly breaks down: e.g. for
![m=12](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D12&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we see that
![\\tfrac{1}{B\_{12}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7BB_%7B12%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yields the overlapping attractor (Figure 12). We have been able to
obtain closed forms for the
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that yield tangent attractors for all
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
except 11, where we report an empirically determined approximate value.
What is the closed form expression for it? This leads to the question of
whether there is a general formula to obtain our
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
that results in tangency? To our knowledge these have not been answered.

It goes without saying that humans are what they are today because of
cows, horses, sheep and goats. Hindu civilization in particular is in
the very least the product for the first two, while remaining two
contributed to it from “behind the scenes”. The major civilizational
transitions in human history were built atop the bones of these four
animals: the Neolithic developments in West Asia, the urban Nilotic
civilization in Egypt, the rise of the Indo-Europeans on the Eurasian
steppes, the rise of the Turco-Mongolic peoples on the same steppes but
at their eastern end, and the expansions of the African pastoralists. We
were curious if the present distribution of these animals has any
notable features or relationship to their history. Accordingly, we used
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization data on these animals to
visualize their distribution across different countries and continents.
Table 1 shows their total population (here the term “cows” stands for
what is provided in the FAOSTAT database as cattle).

We first plot the populations of each pair of these four animals for all
countries that possess both of them using the
![\\log\_{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog_%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The populations of the horses and cows are the most correlated pairs.
The sheep and goats are the next most correlated. Thus, animals of
comparable size tend to be more correlated in their populations. The
horse-cow pair is also the primary pair of the old Indo-European
pastoralism. It is possible there is a historical echo of the
Indo-European conquests that made this pair a widely adopted unit.

[![Livestock_ratios](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/livestock_ratios.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/livestock_ratios.png)Figure
2

We then looked at the distributions of the ratios for these six pairs
(Figure 2). In each plot we mark the following: the mean(red), India
(blue), Mongolia (green), Kazakhstan (gray), Kyrgyzstan (cyan). We can
see that the plot for the cow:horse plot is the least skewed and is
approximately normal. India presents a large country that is heavily
skewed in the favor of the cow over the horse. The horse evidently did
not do very well over larger swaths of India unlike the cow. On one hand
this had its consequences for the Indians in course of their conflict
with horse-borne invaders. On the other it made India the land of cows.
In contrast, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan show the reverse trend,
being horse-heavy pastoralist nations. Kazakhstan was one of the first
sites of horse-domestication in horse-centric pastoralist Botai culture.
This form of pastoralism persisted on the eastern steppes among the
Altaic type of peoples long after the Botai people became extinct after
colliding with our Indo-Iranian ancestors . Mongolia still retains this
state in its most drastic form.

Mongolia is also unusual in favoring both goats and sheep over cows.
Notably it also has a comparable number of sheep and goats. The
sheep:goat ratio shows multimodality with some countries investing
heavily in favor of sheep over goats. This is where the two steppe
nations Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan differ from Mongolia. India in contrast
weighted in favor of goats over sheep, again reflecting the
environmental conditions favoring goats. Further, goat pastoralism might
have come early to India along with the Iranian farmers who played a
major role in the foundation of the Harappan civilization. Nevertheless,
sheep pastoralism eventually spread deep into peninsular India with the
use of sheep milk and a memory of it is preserved in the [origin myths
of the Reḍḍi-s of
Andhra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/09/01/masi-reddi/).
The goat:horse ratio is also notably multimodal suggesting that
originally goats and horses defined very different pastoralist niches.
The effects of this ancient niche distinct appears to persist to this
date.

3. India (blue), Mongolia (green), world (black)

The above are based on the latest population statistics but one can also
ask about their dynamics. In this regard the FAOSTAT database has data
for many countries and the world for about 57 years. One simple way to
look at population change in this period is fraction of population
change with respect to the start and end of this period. This can be
assessed using the formula:

![f\_{pc}=\\dfrac{2(p_f-p_i)}{p_f+p_i}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bpc%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2%28p_f-p_i%29%7D%7Bp_f%2Bp_i%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here
![f\_{pc}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bpc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the fraction of population change,
![p_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the initial population and
![p_f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the final population. The distribution of
![f\_{pc}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bpc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for the four animals is plotted in Figure 3. Except for horses which
have shown a slight decline, the populations of the other animals have
shown growth world-wide. One sees that, except for sheep, the
![f\_{pc}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bpc%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for India is lower than for the world for the remaining animals. In
contrast, for Mongolia it is higher than for the world define a truly
pastoralist nation. The Indian horse populations have shown a notable
decline in this period.

This measure only gives a coarse view of the population change. Hence,
we looked at the absolute population change for 3 nations (Mongolia,
India, USA) in Figure 4 over a 57 year period for which data exists. The
dynamics of the precipitous decline of the horse in India is apparent.
As noted above, much of India is not suited for the horse and in the
absence of the old military and royal-display derived pressure to keep
the horse numbers high it has mostly had a free fall. USA shows almost
the reverse trend with respect horses and cows. We are not sure if this
trend for cows relates to the decline in beef consumption among the
Americans. The India cattle situation two booms followed by busts. The
turning points for these busts seem to correspond to El Niño-related
droughts and it needs to be see if they were indeed the triggering
factors for the declines in Indian cattle. In Mongolia there seem to be
generally similar trends for both cattle and horses. The marked rise in
productivity after the fall of the Soviet Empire suggests the release
from Soviet collectivism allowed the Mongols to recover their
traditional pastoralist lifestyle. The Mongolian situation also shows
the strongest evidence for climate effects, given that after the Soviet
collapse the Mongolian cattle and horse populations have shown similar
busts and booms. These seem to correspond to the aftermath of the severe
Mongolian winters known as the jud-s that take a heavy toll on the
animals and the pastoralists. However, the warming in northern latitudes
might be allowing a rapid bounce back from the juds.

Around 2011 we were approached by a researcher of Indian origin for a
collaboration in biochemistry regarding a family of proteins whose
biochemical functions we had uncovered. After more than an year of
dealing with him, it became clear that his research practices were
questionable. Based on information from a whistle-blower we then reached
the conclusion that he was involved in outright scientific fraud. This
prompted us to investigate his work a little more and we found at least
15 published papers of his with fraudulent data. This brought to our
mind one of the earliest cases of fraud in molecular biology by an
Indian postdoc from Mumbai working with Jim Watson. A broader
investigation revealed that the person whom we were dealing with was
merely one of at least five researchers of Indian background all with
professorial positions in the United States of America and India who
were involved in a very similar pattern of fraud. This concerned us for
it brings a bad name to researchers of Indian origin. However,
simultaneously we also observed several examples of similar fraud by
people of European, Jewish, Chinese and Japanese ethnicity. Indeed, very
recently we had another case to deal with involving comparable, painful
fraud by Chinese collaborators. Hence, we thought this is a universal
problem with no special predilection for such fraud among Indians.

However, as the days went by since our original encounter with fraud, we
seemed to accumulate more and more cases of Indians engaging in such
fraud. Recently, we uncovered yet another case of fraud involving a
family of proteins whose evolution and biochemistry we had helped
characterize in the first decade of the 2000s. This again involved an
Indian lead author giving us the gnawing doubt that things were not
right among our people. This prompted a colleague and me to look at
federal registry of scientific misconduct issued by The Office of
Research Integrity (ORI) of the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS), USA to see if some of the cases we had detected were in it. This
register records cases in which fraudulent research performed using
public money in form of grants given by the DHHS were reported to the
ORI for examination. While the federal register released by ORI does not
cover all cases of fraud performed using public funds, it has at least
60 confirmed cases along with the details of the case and the punishment
recommended by ORI. These 60 cases were in period from 2011 to 2019 CE.
The majority of them were biochemistry/molecular biology fraud of the
kind we had encountered in our starting investigation: 1) manipulation
of gel image; 2) creation of fake images of biological material; 3) Some
cases of simple plagirism; 4) Out right creation of fake numerical data.

We realized that these 60 cases could provide a means of examining if
Indians were particularly prone to fraud or not. Notably, the cases
released in the register allowed the names to be classified quite
unambiguously into 6 ethnic groups (Table 1). Among West Asians there
are representatives from each of the 3 Abrahamistic religions of the
region.

Indians constitute
![33\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=33%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the fraud cases in the federal register. This itself is quite
striking because it is rather clear that they do not make up that high a
fraction of the biomedical research workforce, which is being probed
here. Now, the simplest normalization for the counts is by the
representation of these ethnic groups in the USA. This population data
can be assembled quite easily by an internet search for the period under
consideration. Normalization by this population share is shown in column
4 of table 1 as the number of cheaters per million of the population. By
this reckoning and Indian would be nearly 46 times as likely to be
involved in fraud as a person of European descent.

One could object that the US population share of the ethnic groups is
not a valid normalization for it does not accurately reflect their
representation in the biomedical work force. While the latter part of
the statement might be true it is amply clear to anyone in the business
that Indians do not constitute a fraction greater than Chinese in this
workforce, making this objection quite facile. Yet, one would want to
perform a more objective normalization based on the proportions of these
groups in the workforce. This data is much harder to get in a clean
form. However, an article published in the *Nature* magazine *“The new
face of US science”* by Misty L. Heggeness, Kearney T. W. Gunsalus, José
Pacas and Gary McDowell (03 January 2017) allows us to get approximate
figures needed for such a normalization. This article informs us that in
2014 (which is in the time range of the data under consideration and
also given that a typical graduate student/postdoctoral career in about
4-5 years) that there were about 69000 biomedical researchers in the US.
Of these about 40020 were of European descent (excluding Hispanics) and
23500 with ancestry in various Asian countries. That primarily includes
Indians, Chinese, Koreans and Japanese. To obtain the breakdown we can
use two methods: 1) Sample a random set of 100 biomedical research
publications and see what proportion of these Asians are found in them;
2) Use the proportions of graduate students from these nations in
American biomedical research programs to get a sense of the breakdown.
Based on this we can estimate the approximate maximum number of
biomedical researchers of these ethnicities to be: 4236 Indians, 12236
Chinese, 3928 Koreans and 3059 Japanese. For West Asians it is harder to
get an estimate but based on the biggest contributing group of these the
Israelis from a publication in the Jewish newspaper Haaretz we an infer
this number to be ![\\approx
1725](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+1725&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This allows a more specific normalization, which is shown in column 5 of
Table 1 as the number of fraudsters per 1000 researchers.

The Indians continue to remain the most prone to fraud even after this
more realistic normalization. If the 60 fraudsters were evenly
distributed among the 69000 biomedical researchers then the probability
of finding a fraudster at random would be 0.00087. Given this and their
numbers in the biomedical workforce, the probability that at least 20
Indians are frauds in the federal register by chance alone is ![4.44
\\times
10^{-10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4.44+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or they are ![\\sim
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
times more likely than other populations to commit biomedical research
fraud. From the names of the Indian fraudsters in the federal registry
we can infer that in all likelihood all of them come from the “forward
castes”. Up to
![1/3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of them are likely of brāhmaṇa descent. This means they are drawn from
the Indian elite. As can be seen in Table 2 they are drawn from all over
India with a particular over-representation of individuals from South
Indian states.

Further, since entry into the US biomedical work force typically
involves an IQ test (administered either for admission to an American
graduate school or to an Indian institute), we are dealing with people
most likely with IQ ![\\ge
123](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cge+123&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, what we are seeing is not per say a problem of cognitive capacity
but a problem of “ethics” or “corruption” in the Indian cognitive elite.

One could point out that there is some bias against Hindus in the US
academia; hence, they might be specially picking on the Indians as
opposed to the European origin majority or other foreigners, though all
commit fraud to a similar degree. Undoubtedly there is bias — powerful
fraudsters of European or Jewish descent are more often “rehabilitated”
or overlooked than those of Indian descent. Nevertheless, that is
unlikely to have been the primary cause for at least the cases in the
federal register. Several of the Indian cases in the register were
considered “golden boys” by the American institutions or had vanity
articles about their fraudulent research in American outlets. Thus, it
does not appear that at least in these cases they were being specially
targeted. Thus, we posit that there is a real problem.

A part of this problem is a general one. The Euro-American biomedical
research (which sets the trend in most of the world except to a degree
in Japan) is beset with several serious problems:  
\* There is very little attention paid in biology education to the
theoretical foundations of the science. We would go as far as to say
that less than 50
![\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of the practitioners in biomedical research have good grasp of the
foundations of biology. To give an analogy of how bad this is, imagine
more than half the physicists and *real* engineers plying their trade
without knowing classical mechanics in any serious sense (e.g. having
not much of a clue of how to set up a Hamiltonian or a Lagrangian of a
system). As a result poor hypotheses abound, which in turn spawn a glut
of bad ideas.

\* The Euro-American scientific system has an unhealthy model of
competition and the fetish of peer-review, which favor both an urge to
cheat to get an article published as well as rich dividends for nuanced
plagiarism -i.e. plagiarism of ideas without citation rather than
outright copying of text. To put it bluntly we have seen some form a
plagiarism of our work with total impunity almost every other month in
the past few years. Plagiarism also contributes to confirmation bias and
fake reproduction of bad ideas. A part of this competition is fostered
by big labs in several Euro-American institutions, where powerful
principal investigators run the show like industrial sweat shops. These
environments also do not allow for proper oversight — I am aware of
cases where the graduate student or postdoc did not see the PI for more
than a month at a stretch. Further, most interaction was limited to
sanitized presentations in lab meeting rather than direct oversight by
the PI at the bench.

\* The magazine culture: Euro-American biomedical research assessement
and funding agencies place enormous emphasis on publication in the two
famous British and American science tabloids or the journal *Cell*,
their many offspring and upstarts like *eLife*, *PLOS Biology* etc. In
some of these venues, especially the tabloids and *Cell* articles are
subject to insane review processes with time lags of 6-12 months from
submission to acceptance for publication. These venues are thus high
stakes venues that increase the urge for plagiarism and chicanery.

These are general causes that affect both Indians and others. However,
as the scientific system in India increasingly emulates these practices
in some form, it increases the incentive for Indians in India to commit
fraud rather than do good science. Now let us consider some factors that
might predispose Indian origin researchers to commit fraud more often
than others:  
\* Some of the fraudsters who are in the federal register come from labs
run but Indian origin PIs in American institutions. Their labs are
reported as having an unhealthy environment — high pressure to produce
results at short notice without adequate mentoring or oversight. We have
evidence that this was the case even in the fraud cases which are not in
the register. As noted above this is a major recipe for malpractice.
Thus, it appears that there is some tendency for Indian origin PIs to be
less than professional in managing their labs.

\* Indians face major immigration constraints in the US. This can be
used as an anvil both by American and Indian origin PIs to pressurize
their students, who typically have no other avenues for escape or
alternative employment due to sword of deportation hanging above their
necks. Hence, science takes a back seat to survival and the incentives
are slanted towards getting ahead by means of malpractice.

\* Training in Indian schools and colleges does not emphasize aspects of
honest scientific practice. Students often manipulate laboratory
experiments to get results that their instructor expects. Little
training is given in the statistics of variation and experimental error
in school and college. For example, in my first semester in college I
vividly remember the instructor conducting physics lab demanding that we
exactly get
![g=9.8\\tfrac{m}{s^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%3D9.8%5Ctfrac%7Bm%7D%7Bs%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in single trial experiment!

\* Importantly, most students in the science stream in India have no
real interest in science per say but merely see it as a means for
obtaining a seat in engineering or medical school. Those who do not make
it typically enter the sciences and gradually drift their way through a
B.Sc. and then a M.Sc. to finally reach a graduate program. Most of them
are not from the cream of the educational system and are often not
suited for cutting-edge science. Thus, when they make it to graduate
school in the US they come ill-equipped for science and when subject to
pressure might have some incentive to “game the system” just as they
gamed the exams in India to get ahead.

\* After the near-death encounters with Islam and Christianity, Hindu
civilization is a shadow of its former self. There is serious decline of
the internal system known as dharma. The decline of dharma shows up in
the form of loss of discernment regarding the pursuit of knowledge and
the pursuit of gain. In the past when a person committed himself to the
pursuit of knowledge, there was a strong demand on him to observe
certain ethics. These were enforced by the gate-keepers of the system
and quacks would be punished. Indeed, father Manu the law-giver has a
long list of criminals engaging in fraud like palmistry or
future-prognostication, quacks, scams, and fellows claiming
qualifications which they do not possess. He recommends that such be
caught by the Rājan using investigators sent to keep an eye on such and
if their crimes are proven to fine them. However, multiple repeat
offenders could be put to death. Similar the legal tradition of
Yājñavalkya has various provisions for the punishment of the quack
physician.

In conclusion, we do not find any pleasure in presenting this. It
personally only affects us in a negative way given that it has brought a
bad name for Indian researchers, which is not going to go away in the
near future. That is why I tell people that it is better to be a small
man doing some low key but real science rather than professor Big who
appears in the newspapers but does fake science. The approach of fake it
till you make needs to be adopted with greatest care and does not apply
to every aspect of human activity. These observations might have much
deeper, unpleasant implications. It is relatively clear that the Hindus
have not performed too well for being an old nation with clearly visible
past achievements after they saw off the English tyrants more than 70
years ago. There are many reasons offered like the effects of the
medieval Mohammedan incubus, the English tyranny, and Gandhi and Nehru.
The former factors certainly have had their effect. But the past 70 odd
years since independence have seen no major revival of scientific
pursuit. There have been no major successors to many of the exemplary
solitary Hindu researchers from the pre-Independence or early
post-Independence era. We suspect that one cause for this is a terrible
culture of knowledge generation among Indians in recent times. An
offshoot of this is this tendency of dishonesty that we are seeing among
Indian biomedical researchers. It shows in terms of tangible technology
too: despite having an big need for the aeronautical engine or a proper
assault rifle, Indians have had considerable difficulty in successfully
mastering these technologies. Facets of this are also seen in other
areas of Indian creative expression, e.g. journalism and cinema. I do
not watch cinema but I am reliably informed by someone who does that
there is some tendency for plagiarism from the occident. As with
science, this tendency in journalism along with unthinking adoption of
occidental memes are damaging for the nation. In journalism the idea is
merely to produce uncritical stuff that the pay-master (e.g. the
mleccha) likes. Hence, we feel that this data should be presented so
that our people make take deep look at their problems and consider their
science policy implementations accordingly.

As described here these entries are from the [scrapbook of
Somakhya](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/leaves-from-the-scrapbook/).  
**Entry 3; Nimlukti, year Anala of the first cycle:** I was still at
Turushkarajapura at a lab where I had access to a computer-network with
a large number of nodes that I needed for my analysis. It also gave me
some opportunity to talk to several researchers in my general field of
inquiry. I was to leave the coming weekend to Kshayadrajanagara to take
an exam. It was also an opportunity for me to spend some time with my
friend Indrasena and catch up with his studies and other more rarefied
matters. I had gone earlier in the evening to meet a member of my
extended family for dinner. Also at dinner was a noted mantravādin known
to him. We had a lively debate with him about the correct practice of
various mantra-s and the incorrectness of the māhāpāduka-dīkṣā relative
to the krama-dīkṣā. We essentially tried to impress on him that none of
the mantra-s would have fully efficacy and in cases could even be
harmful if not performed as per the authoritative tantra-s of the
kaula-mārga duly adjusted for a brāhmaṇa: indeed for a brāhmaṇa, the
śruti is a higher authority at a basic level than any tantra. Then our
host remarked to us that he had a friend, a coethnic of ours, whose
daughter also needed to travel to Kshayadrajanagara for an internship at
the same university as where Indrasena’s brother was an intern. He told
me that I should perform the role of a minder to her on the train
journey to the city. I had to agree for it was an elder’s command but
was reluctant about it for it meant I had to be responsible for a
woman’s safety especially in cities where evil marūnmatta-s and dasyu-s
were known to be on the prowl looking for women.

**Entry 4; Āgantu, year Anala of the first cycle**: I was at station to
board the train to Kshayadrajanagara. My extended clansman’s wife got
the young lady who I had accompany. She seemed like a quiet and shy
person who said nothing beyond her name which was Shallaki. While
remarkably unusual like that of the caturbhaginī, it still sounded
vaguely familiar though I could not place it. Since I am no
conversationalist myself I did not say anything beyond my name and just
helped her a bit with her luggage. She seemed to be in the age range as
the two younger caturbhaginī but something again struck me as unusual
beyond her name: she had some lakṣaṇa-s similar to them unlike no other
women, which are only visible to the insiders of the gaṇacakra. I again
quietly remarked to myself that it was a strange thing. While some
ruffianly dāḍhīvāle got into the train with us, thankfully, they passed
ahead and the two other travelers in the compartment seemed innocuous.
One was a soldier and the other was a pious vaiṣṇava woman. As the train
got moving I spent my time looking out of the window as the vast
expanses of Bhārata had always fascinated me. Occasionally an
interesting temple and on other occasions a cemetery would pass by. When
the latter would come in sight I would quietly utter the first verse of
the Nīlarudra. Sometimes a strange-looking granite mountain would pass
by. By examining its rock closely, I realized that these were the
Archean granites — some of the oldest rocks on the Earth. As the train
coursed ahead I caught sight of some sedimentary rocks likely from the
Proterozoic and remarked to myself that someday I should perhaps journey
there to see if I could collect some of that rock.

The reddish dusk soon gave way to the inky darkness of night and I could
catch sight of the great star
![\\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
Cygni giving me a good indication of the precise direction in which we
were traveling. In clear air away from the cities I could catch sight of
the Milky Way sprawling in the midst of the summer triangle. My
fellow-traveler Shallaki then opened a large packet my extended
clanswoman had provided her and asked if I might want to have dinner. I
acquiesced and she quietly gave me a share while telling me that I could
take more if I wished. She also courteously offered the food to the
other two passengers who had, however, purchased their own fare. I
received a message from Lootika who was also journeying back home to
take the same exam but at a different center. Like me she too was
unhappy about the break it was causing to the flow of our work. She also
had some other sense of unease, which she stated arose from an encounter
with a bhūta that Vrishchika had told her about. But the exchange grew
more lively when she said that she had collected several specimens of
microthelyphonid whip-scorpions in course of her field work that had
been totally ignored since the English naturalists had found them in the
days when their tyrants were lording it over our land. We exchanged
messages regarding the peculiar bristles on their second limb wondered
what their function might be. Thinking about this I seem to have fallen
asleep.

The next morning when I arose the rest of the passengers in the
compartment were already awake. The elderly vaiṣṇava woman was reading
some devotional material and asked me if a certain station had passed
since I was the only one who kept gazing out of the window. I replied in
the negative. She was happy as she said that she wanted to get some
surasā and uttered it with a Dravidian accent. I was a bit puzzled and
did not get what she said. Shallaki pointed to me that she meant surasā
as in tulasī. A little while later the train stopped for at that station
and I darted out and got bunches of basil for the vaiṣṇava woman. Since
she said she was proceeding to a shrine of Nṛsiṃha where she wanted to
offer them I got some extra bunches so that she might offer some on our
behalf too. She was very thankful that I had obtained the basil given
that she might have not been fast enough with her aging limbs to get
back into the train. She insisted on getting me and Shallaki dośaka-s in
the next stop despite our strong protestations. Invoking Rudra that his
darts might not harm me in the form of food I consumed the dośaka in
order not offend the elderly woman.

When Shallaki told me that the lady meant tulasī by surasā, I made a
remark that it gives some hint about the obscure etymology of the
plant’s name. Till that point in the journey Shallaki and I had
exchanged just a couple of sentences but her eyes suddenly lit up at
that comment of mine and we had a interesting discussion on the
etymology of the Indian words for the basil and wandered off into a
discursive chat on the substrate in Indo-Aryan. It was in course of that
conversation that I learned that she was interested in the evolution of
languages and that it was the object of her study. The conversation also
convinced me that the crossing of our paths had some deeper significance
but I still did not known what it was.

**Entry 5; Cakram, year Anala of the first cycle:** Finally, we arrived
at Kshayadrajanagara and upon getting off the train I saw Indrasena and
his brother Pinakasena who had come to pick me up. I introduced them to
Shallaki. The brothers stole a quick glance at each other with utter and
unbelievable surprise but did not say anything. Suddenly, I realized
that a prophesy from a few years back by might be playing out. We
boarded the bus to go to Indrasena’s home. While my mother had wanted
that I stay with my uncle during this visit, I instead had made up my
mind to stay with Indrasena’s family. My cousin Saumanasa was also
writing the same exam and I thought I could meet her briefly after the
exam and convey my familial sentiments.

As the bus labored through the crowded roads of Kshayadrajanagara we saw
many a dirty sight — a consequence of a roguish political party
Congress-S which ruled the state and paid little heed to cleanliness.
Coming from a small town Shallaki was more startled by the sights than
the rest of us. Suddenly the bus came to a standstill and showed no
signs of even inching forward. Despite craning my neck, I could not see
much but Pinakasena clarified that the city was being visited by an
important CEO of a mleccha multinational, a person of Indian origin,
Pachchaisundari by name. Her convoy was passing by and had held up all
the traffic. She was recently in the news for the supreme court had
green-lighted her plan of online-social credit which she had established
in collaboration with another CEO Lundberg. It works thus: If you say
publicly made a statement on social media like ”Mohammad was perhaps the
greatest man who ever walked on the earth” or ”Mahmud Ghaznavi employed
Hindus and Moslems alike based on their merit and service credentials”
then you got a positive credit. On the other hand if you made a
statement like ”Baboor demolished a famous temple of the Hindus at
Ayodhya” then you got a negative credit. Building negative credit could
eventually lead to such a score that your email on Pachchaisundari’s
platform could be locked up for a week or you could not post on social
media and so on. But if you built positive credit you could cash it for
discounts on online purchases, subsidized tickets for online movies and
serials and the like. It was being touted as a great tool to aid the
building of secular democracies although it was a model pioneered first
in the neo-Han empire of Xi in China.

After nearly a half hour wait, we finally got moving and reached
Indrasena’s house. We let Pinakasena to lead Shallaki to the apartment
she was to stay in with two other women. After I had refreshed myself
with a bath, I went to Indrasena’s room and he mentioned the prognosis
of the
[Vīrabhadra-nartaka](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/03/leaves-from-the-scrapbook-2/).
I nodded and said that everything was falling in place indeed and
confirmed to him that till the moment I saw him and his brother I did
not precisely realize what was playing out. Indrasena asked me if had
heard anything from Lootika and before I could answer told me of
Vrishchika’s encounter with the bhūta. I remarked that Lootika was
rather worried of the same and that the alignments of the prophesies
were rather striking and even quite unexpected to me.

**Entry 6; Luki, year Anala of the first cycle:** After the exam was
over I briefly dropped by at my uncle’s workplace to wish him and then
went to his house to meet my cousins and aunt. Then I ambled back to
Indrasena’s home for the evening. Pinakasena had sought the permission
of his parents to have Shallaki over over for dinner. Thus, when I came
in the three of them were lost in a discussion on certain intricacies of
the upāsanā of Guhyakālī. The prophesy was now confirmed in my mind
beyond any smidgen of doubt. Leaving the other two to continue their
discussion, for it was after all their kula, Indra and I went over to
his room. He asked me a bit about the exam since he was to write the
same the following year. I then offered worship to his idols and
pictures of
[Vaiśravaṇa](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/01/02/matters-of-religion-he-becomes-naravahanadatta/).
He told me of a strange dream he had witnessed the prior night — he
seemed think there was something to it. He had dreamt of a man being
killed by a centrifuge rotor exploding out of its spin-drive and
striking him. The four of us then went up to the terrace to ply the
planchette as we all felt a strong premonition of encountering at least
one bhūta. Surely enough, we had steady stream of phantoms animating our
device one after the other. The first bhūta startled Indrasena greatly.
It was a ghost of a young man who said that he had been killed in a
centrifuge blast at Turushkarajapura. Indrasena wanted to engage him a
bit more but I sensed danger in letting him hang around. So I signaled
to Indra to dismiss him right away. Before leaving he tried to seize
Shallaki but she repulsed him with a mantra that neither I nor Indra
knew but was apparently known to Pinakasena. I knew, however, that it
was not the last that our gang was going to see of this phantom.

The next bhūta was that of a young woman who narrated the following
biographical details: While she was born in a dīkṣita family, she had
degenerated to being a puṃścalī. Indra remarked that it was a case of
regression to the mean but it could have been something worse — a
memetic infection triggered by familial degeneration. She began
practicing her puṃścalī-vṛtti while she was enrolled in college. There
were exams at the end of the semester. Previously, for the physics exam
students could only use log tables or slide-rules. However, that year
there was an announcement that the state might allow the use of
electronic calculators. Being flush with money for a college student due
to her puṃścalī-vṛtti she had bought herself two calculators an ordinary
one and a scientific one and took them with her in the hope that the
state might allow calculators on the morning of the physics exam.
Indeed, they permitted the use of calculators that day. There was a
brāhmaṇa boy in her exam hall who had only brought log tables. He was on
only one in the class who had no calculator and at a clear disadvantage
of finishing in time. He asked the supervisor if he could share the
calculator of his neighbor. The puṃścalī stood up and told the
supervisor that she could lend the brāhmaṇa her spare ordinary
calculator. The supervisor acquiesced. With that and the log tables he
was able to smash the exam and finished it well ahead of time. However,
puṃścalī having spent her time elsewhere during the semester found the
going tough. So she looked at the brāhmaṇa who sat a few benches away.
He realized she was in trouble and placed his answer sheet such that she
could copy some of his stuff. Thus, she somehow passed and obtained a
degree. She had subsequently become a high-level veśyā and grown close
to a certain Habib Raqib. He sliced her throat one day as she refused
him her services for free that day. She wondered if she had any puṇya
left from her service to the brāhmaṇa. We dismissed her by directing her
at the marūnmatta who had killed her.

The next ghost was also that of a young woman of the vaiśya-varṇa. She
declared herself to be a roadside maker of fast-food like bhṛjika-s and
śṛṅgāṭaka-s. She was originally from a barely middle-class family
hailing from a sector of Mathura where an old temple of Kumāra had
stood. All members of her immediate family had been killed by socialists
when they were journeying on a vacation to see some relatives in
Magadha. She was take for dead in the attack but survived as the body of
her brother had taken all the bullets shielding her. A distant relative
had given her some money and with that she journeyed to
Kshayadrajanagara along with a vagabond friend and two set themselves up
there on a street there as fast-food makers. Her vagabond friend was
killed shortly thereafter in an accident but she labored on. Her snacks
were so popular that she was soon demolishing the businesses of her
rivals on the street. Her rivals harassed her in several ways and had
her cart confiscated. However, is so happened that the inspector of the
local police-station had become a big fan of her snacks; so, he restored
her cart and utensils and let her continue her trade. He even went as
far as to help her from harassment by the rivals. One evening her stove
suddenly switched of by itself and she saw the image of her own face in
its dying flame. The next day she found her skin darkening, felt a
tingling sensation in her extremities and a racing heart. It kept
getting worse and eventually she expired. Her corpse was handed over to
the local hospital. The physician named Jayasena who performed the
autopsy on her corpse had declared that she had been poisoned by the
”scorpion-killer”. She said it was slipped into her food by the rival
vendors and she was searching for them.

The next phantom that possessed our device was that of a brāhmaṇa man.
He was clearly aggressive and apparently a learned V1, which made us
curious about his fate. But he did not answer our questions and instead
posed questions to us. He asked us: ”In which saṃhitā are the Rudra-s
called Sadāśiva-s?” We thought it was joke. But he said he would not
leave like Vikrama’s vetāla unless one of us answered. Taking hold of
the planchette I told him that it was that it was in the AV. He asked me
then to spell out the mantra. I recited the ṛk and he said by way of the
device ”svasti”. He then spewed a string of what looked like nonsense
words and paused but we knew he was still there. Indra and I realized
after a bit that he had communicated a protein sequence. We asked him
back ”What?” He responded: ”What is its structure and function”. I said
it was a helix-turn-helix domain and that it would bind DNA and was a
likely transcription factor. He declared that we had passed the test and
asked us we knew of some proteins that he named. Indra and I answered in
the positive. Then he gave us a bit of his biography. He said that he
was the one who had discovered them and elucidated their origins and
function. Even though he had published several works on them, he said
that his discoveries were appropriated by some barbarous mleccha-s who
became renowned for that. He then said that he had wished to strike back
at them but he was struck by a dart of Paśupati and was unable to do so.
He said that was because even though he was nearly a sarvaśāstravit his
yoga had failed him like the astra-s failing the sūtaputra. He had then
faded away into oblivion like the Italian Majorana. He then said
something rather troublesome to me: ”If the spider remains with you, you
will be greater than me. In the previous round the plant was crushed
below the eyes of Skanda. But it this round the spider could crushed
below the eyes of Skanda and you will die soon after her.” He then
uttered a howl and left saying: ”If you help me avenge my defeats I
would come to your aid as Vetālabhaṭṭa”. Indra and I looked at each
other knowing that what we had heard from the previous two ghosts was
not a joke. I remarked to him:”The last two are not unrelated. This will
be of the order of the killing of the fierce Bharadvāja on the Kuru
field.” Indra said to me: ”The only astra we can take recourse to is
that of Atharvāṅgirasa incantations. The yāga should be performed but
what if it is disrupted like that of Viśvāmitra?”

In the early 1100s of the CE Rtsa-mi lotsawa Sangs-rgyas grags-pa was in
Nālandā, India, to study and transmit the latest that the tāntrika
strain of Bauddha-mata had to offer. Within a century both his world and
that of his Indian hosts was to come crashing down. It was almost as if
the prophetic section of the nāstika Kālacakra-tantram that he was there
to study and take to his lands would play out unerringly as the
yuga-cakra turned with the irruption of the demons of makkhaviṣaya and
the mlecchendra-duṣṭa-s. Sometime close to the beginning of the 1200s a
marauding band of Mohammedans led by the Moslem Turk Ghazi Ikhtiyar
al-Din Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji razed to ground this famed mahāvihāra
of Nālandā. Rtsa-mi lotsawa Sangs-rgyas grags-pa was a Tangut from their
kingdom known as Xi Xia in inner Asia. In 1205 CE the Tanguts supported
the fleeing rivals of Chingiz Khan and were subject to a swift punitive
assault by the Mongols from the western corridor. The Mongols followed
it up by further invasions in the Tangut territory in 1207-8, 1209-10
and 1215 CE, in each case punishing them, seizing bits of their kingdom
and forcing them to vassalage. In 1217 CE the great Khan sent an
emissary asking the Tangut kingdom to join the Mongols in the great
assault on the Mohammedans of Khwarazm. The Tangut king arrogantly
responded: “If you have no strength \[to fight on your own\] there is no
reason to be a Khan.” The Tanguts were pay dearly for this: they became
the target of the final campaign of Chingiz Khan. By 1227 CE the Mongols
had [erased the Tangut kingdom off the face of the
earth](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/08/31/a-brief-overview-of-the-last-campaign-of-chingiz-khan-and-the-issue-of-succession-in-the-mongol-empire/).

What was the origin of this Tangut Kingdom and what was its story? This
remained somewhat mysterious given that it had been annihilated by the
Mongols. However, their language survived that event and continued to be
used by the remaining Tanguts until it was finally exterminated by the
Ching. They would have remained a mystery had they not produced an
enormous volume of written literature, a library of which was discovered
by the Russian explorer PK Kozlov in 1908 in the Tangut fort of Qara
Khoto. This library has formed the bed rock of Tangutology, which has
since then has had a small but vigorous set of practitioners. It is
rather unfortunate that there has been no Indian interest or
participation in Tangutology especially given the religious links they
had to India and the importance they attached to knowledge of the
Sanskrit language and production of translations from it. Further, after
the destruction of their kingdom the surviving members of the ruling
clan became notable in the Indian state of Sikkim. The Tangut language
was itself written in a very complex system where basic logograms are
successively put together to make a new array of logograms that
represent further new words. They superficially resemble Chinese but are
mostly unrelated to it. This complex Tangut script was almost designed
like a secret code so that none of their competitors and neighbors like
the Tibetans, the Uighurs, the Khitan or the Han could read their
documents. It was also designed with the view that its structure encoded
a certain innate “mantraic power” — ultimately a Hindu concept acquired
from the bauddha tradition (It is conceivable that the mysterious Khitan
script also was designed with such ideas in mind). This script was in
place by at least 1036 CE. The Tangut language written in this script
found in the books discovered by Kozlov was deciphered by the great
Russian Japanologist NA Nevsky, who was murdered by Stalin’s henchmen
before he could publish it. This decipherment has formed the foundation
of the Tangut studies that followed and suggest that it was member of
the Tibeto-Burman family of languages. These texts give us a picture of
the heydays of a rather interesting state, the Tangut Kingdom.

![Tangut_manuscript](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/tangut_manuscript.png)

A Tangut document showing their script and artwork

From the Chinese evidence we observe that their predecessors or at least
that of the ruling Ngvemi clan of the Tanguts might have originally had
links to the Tabgach (Chinese: Tuoba) people with Altaic affinities:
they were either early Turks or Mongols or a distinct extinct branch of
the Altaic family. Consistent with this, the Mohammedan Qarakhanid Turk,
Mahmud Kashghari, who wrote a Turkic-Arabic lexicon mentions the
contemporary Tanguts as being one of the more sedentary of the 20 tribes
of Turks that he lists. A Chinese Song record also claims that they were
a clan of Turks. A memory of the pastoralist origin of the ruling clan,
consistent with Altaic roots, appears to have been preserved in the poem
of one of their ancestors that reflects the simple concerns of such
herders:

They fixed the livestock enclosure, a wolf cannot get it,  
They dug a well in the thicket, the livestock will not suffer from
thirst.

If the courageous and wise do not sit \[there\], the meeting will not be
successful,  
If there is no bull with high horns in the herd, the herd is empty.

If you cannot ride the rounds on a horse, it is no good for riding.  
If the livestock are beyond count, the owner deals only with livestock.

If you know the saying poorly, you will not be able to have a
conversation,  
If you have a few horses and yaks, you will not eat your fill.

There are no better close ones than \[one’s\] father and mother,  
there is no meat tastier than the meat on the bones.

He who has livestock is not rich,  
He who has a \[good\] mind is rich.

-translated from the original Tangut by the famous Tangutologist
Kychanov.

In their own mysterious verse on their ancestry, they claim that their
ruling Ngvemi clan stemmed from their ancestral mother ‘A-mbah (the
etymology of this name is unknown to me but of interest!):

Our mother ‘A-mbah, source of families and clans,  
silver-wombed and golden breasted,  
the valiant tribe did not die out and  
carries the name of Ngvemi.

-translated by Kychanov

In this regard it is notable that the Mongol sources in China mention a
Tangut ethnonym as Yü-mi, which is believed to be derived from the name
of trans-Himalayan goddess Umai who is mentioned as consort of Möngke
Tengri in Turko-Mongol sources. In the Indo-Aryan world this goddess was
incorporated as an ectype of Rudrāṇī i.e. Umā. It is hence conceivable
that her other name Ambā has a relationship to the ancestral mother of
the Tanguts mentioned in the above verse.

However, in their own writings the Tangut also mention that they as a
people, the Tibetans and the Han Chinese have a common origin: was this
some kind of early recognition of the monophyly of their Tibeto-Burman
languages? In their earliest days going back to the 300-400 CE they
appear to have had marriage relationships with the para-Mongolic Tuyuhun
(Tuguhun) Khaganate and played a role in the formation of this state in
between the Tibetans and the Chinese. It was in this period they appear
to have associated with the speakers of the Tibeto-Burman language that
became the dominant language of the Tanguts. Other Tabgach people appear
to have sinicized early and adopted Chinese in the more eastern regions.
As the Tibetans started expanding their empire in the 600s and eating
into the Tuyuhun Khaganate and marching towards Tang China the
proto-Tangut fled North-East and submitted to the Tang empire in return
for protection of their identity against the Tibetan advance. Thus,
having survived the Tibetan assault and the proto-Tangut developed a
close client relationship with the Tang Chinese empire. However, this
did not help them when they came under attack again, this time from a
more determined foe — [the Blue
Turks](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)
(Gök Türks) of Mongolia. Blue Turk ruler Qapaghan Khagan had charted out
a comprehensive plan to attack the Tang empire and punish the Chinese
severely. He first aimed to capture the Chinese towns of Paoting and
Chengting and for this decided to perform a flank-clearing operation by
neutralizing those who might come to the aid to the Tang. Thus, in 700
CE he sent his 17 year old nephew the rising star of the Turks and their
future Khagan, Tengrida Bilge, against the Tangut. This is the first
time we hear of them under that name. The results of the devastating
Turkic attack on them is summarized in the Orkhon inscriptions thus:
“When I was 17 years old I went on a campaign against the Tangut. I put
the Tangut to rout; there I took their wives and children, horses and
possession” \[Translation: Talat Tekin from the Bilge Khagan inscription
in Mongolia\].

Having barely survived this assault they got a chance to enhance their
profile when the Blue Turks and the
[Uighurs](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-uighur-empire/)
were gone or had declined and Tang empire was wracked by natural
calamities in the late 800s. The Tang excesses in their wake triggered
the rebellion of farmers under Wang Xianzhi. At the same time a Chinese
smuggler Huang Chao was taking advantage of salt shortages to run a salt
trafficking operation. Having amassed a force of fighters he made an
initial alliance with Wang Xianzhi and then broke up with him to lead
his own rebellion, which in many ways paralleled that of the Chinese
brother of Jesus Christ closer to our times. At the height of his
rebellion Huang Chao took Guangzhou and then the Tang capital of
Chang’an. The Tang emperor fleeing from these attacks called upon the
proto-Tangut lord Tuoba Ssu-Kung (880-884 CE) to come to his aid. The
Tangut crushed the Huang Chao rebellion in the west between and were
rewarded the regions of Inner Mongolia by the Tang and title of “Prince
Pacifier of the West”. The Tangut lords then welded together a
multi-ethnic state which other than themselves contained Chinese,
Tibetans and the remnants of the Tuyuhun Khanganate (Some of whom later
joined Chingiz Khan; e.g. the lord Alaqush-digit-quri).

Subsequently, with the decline of the competing Central Asian powers
operating in the region the Tangut were able to solidify their power. In
the 900s when the Tang collapsed the Tangut established themselves as an
independent state. While the Song tried to reconquer the old Chinese
territory in 960 CE they could not subjugate the Tangut who continued to
grow in power. In northern China the Khitan of para-Mongolic origin had
established the Liao dynasty, which was also poised for potential
conflict with the Tangut. However, negotiating their hold through these
times they consolidated their kingdom as the Xi Xia, which was what
Chingiz Khan eventually destroyed. It came to include what is today the
Western and Central part of China’s Gansu province, Northern Ordos in
Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui.

By around 1000 CE it appears that the Tangut queen Lady Wang had become
a practicing bauddha with special attachment to the deity Mañjuśrī. At
her death in 1007 CE the Tangut requested that the Song allow offerings
to be sent to Mañjuśrī at his holy mountain Wutai in the name of the
late queen. The Song allowed these offerings to proceed but had reasons
to be vary of the Tangut. The Tangut prince Li Yuanhao, who also had an
affinity to Mañjuśrī, was a noted warrior and began a series of
conquests of Chinese and Uighur lands starting in the 1020s. He took
Hexi and then in 1028 advanced against the Uighurs. The Tanguts defeated
them after a bloody battle which is recorded by Mahmud Kasghari with
some glee because that relieved the Uighur pressure on the Qarakhanid
Mohammedans. Thus, the Tanguts seized Ganzhou and moving on in 1030-31
Li Yuanhao captured Liangzhou and finally took Dunhuang. This brought
him in possession of various bauddha domains strengthening his
association with the religion. Sometime after 1035 CE an Indian śramaṇa,
evidently fleeing from the assault of the Mohammedans led by Mahmud and
Masud of Ghazni on Gandhara and the Panjab, reached the Tangut kingdom.
He presented Li Yuanhao with what he claimed were 150 relics from the
cremation of the Buddha. These were supposed to include an ungual and a
cranial fragment (likely from Gandhara). Filled with piety Yuanhao had
an elaborate coffin made for them with a stone inner chamber in which
they were placed in a silk wrap with gems. This in turn was placed in an
iron box which was then placed inside a golden casket which in turn was
placed in a silver outer coffin. The coffin was then placed above an
underground spring. On top of the coffin he had an image of Kubera
installed and the yakṣarāṭ was invoked to protect the king and state and
provide overflowing granaries. In this period Yuanhao (1035 CE) also
bartered several horses that they were good at breeding as pastoralists
for bauddha texts in Chinese translation from the Song. He obtained
another batch from the Khitan for a similar barter of horses. He then
commissioned translation of all of these into the Tangut language by a
panel of scholars — this illustrates the esteem in which he held the
direct textual study of bauddha knowledge.

Thereafter, around 1038 CE Yuanhao declared himself to be cakravartin,
superior to all the Han emperors of the past, and his kingdom to be a
dharmarājya. Despite claims of being an embodiment of humaneness as per
the bauddha-mata Yuanhao’s coronation rituals as cakravartin had
elements that were clearly aimed at a display of military power. It
remains unclear where these elements of the rituals came from — the
pre-bauddha Tangut religion or from some Altaic adaptation of the
bauddha-mata. We hear that:

“\[Yuanhao\] together with his braves smeared blood on their lips and
took an oath first to attack Fuyan, desiring to enter \[Song territory\]
simultaneously from three routes out of Dejing, Saimen fort, and
Chicheng. Then \[he\] built an altar, received appointment, and assumed
the imperial position (ji huangdi wei). At that time \[he\] was thirty
sui.” – translation from noted Tangutologist Ruth Dunnell.

Hence, when in 1038 CE when Li Yuanhao, now king of the Tanguts, wanted
to send offerings to Wutai the Song blocked them claiming that he was
using it as ploy to spy on the defenses of Shanxi, which they felt he
might raid next. Enraged Li Yuanhao commissioned the construction of
this own mountain-shrine of Mañjuśrī for worship according the tantra
known as the Mañjuśrīya-mūlakalpa. This was set up in the Helan
mountains west of modern Yinchuan oriented in the holy Northeast axis of
Mañjuśrī with respect to India.

By this time the Tangut state came into its own as a well-oiled military
machine. Their law stipulated that every able-bodied man from age 15 to
70 was to enlist to serve in the army. Failure to enlist was punished
right away with death. Every boy at age 15 was subject to a special
medical checkup by state doctors and if found fit was registered in the
army. Half were assigned to the reserves and half were placed in the
current fighting register. Based on their abilities the men were either
placed in the fighting force or in service and logistics or in military
engineering. The latter included military manufacture, which produced
iron and fashioned cavalry swords (= talvār-s) on a large scale that
were reported as being among the best in the world by the contemporary
Chinese. The recruits were classified based on the household income: the
men from lower income families had to join the army with either one
horse or one camel; those with higher income had to join with two horses
or two camels. The main fighting force of the Tanguts was a formidable
cavalry with each unit placed under a unit commander who was to be
protected by his men to death. The best men were drawn into elite forces
units known as the “Iron hawks” who conducted special operations and
deployed special weapons. They also had a special weapons
camel-division, which comprised of mobile stone-throwing machines with a
rotating base mounted on camel backs which allowed all-round
bombardment. On the theoretical front the Tangut made a close study of
the military theories of other civilizations. They made several
translations of the Chinese military works like the “The General’s
Garden” and the “Art of War”, both of which they appear to have adapted
to their needs. The Chinese record the terror of the movement of the
Tangut army which they mention as “moving like a tornado this way and
that…” This martial background of the Tanguts provides a measure of the
military achievement of Chingiz Khan and his men when they smashed the
Tangut armies one after another.

With a strong military system in place in Li Yuanhao eyed further
hostilities with this neighbors even as he had vowed during his
coronation as cakravartin. In 1038 he faced the possibility of enmity
the with the Khitans as his wife who was a Khitan died under mysterious
circumstances and the Khitans suspected that he might have eliminated
her. Having for the time being pacified the Khitan ambassador sent to
his court Li Yuanhao marched against the Qingtang Tibetan state and
crushed them. Then in 1039 he opened the big war with the Han Chinese of
the Song empire. This war lasted 5 years and towards its end the Khitan
also joined it against the Tanguts. However, the cakravartin proved his
name and emerged victorious on both fronts solidifying the Tangut state
and perhaps now justifying the the term empire applied to it due to his
conquests. In 1046 Yuanhao faced a second Khitan invasion which ended
inconclusively on the battlefield but the Tangut ended up retaining
their territory. A couple of years later Yuanhao and his eldest son,
with whose mother he had a conflict, had an armed duel and he was killed
as a result.

In the interim period where a tribal council was ruling them the Tanguts
faced a defeat at the hands of the Khitan (1051) and a few years later
they negotiated peace with the Khitans who, however, refused to have any
marriage with them from then on. In this period they were ruled by a
queen who was assassinated in 1056 CE. In 1067 for the first time in a
while the Song were able to retaliate for the successive defeats they
had been facing at the hands of the Tangut and defeat them even as their
cakravartin Liangzuo, bastard son of Yuanhao born of incest died. The
Han Chinese followed this up with successive victories against the
Tanguts and in 1081 taking advantage of their internal strife launched
an invasion of their empire. Finally, in 1084 after heavy losses the
Tanguts repulsed the Chinese. They faced a Tibetan invasion shortly
thereafter but managed to negotiate a settlement without territorial
loss. In 1096 the Song attacked the Tanguts again in attempt to destroy
them but they repeatedly asked the Khitan for help and finally in 1099
managed to repel the Chinese attack albeit with loss of some territory.
The Chinese then took advantage of the turmoil in Tibet and tried to
invade it. The Tangut quickly formed an alliance with the Tibetans
against the Song and established a marriage alliance with the Kokonor
Tibetan ruler to face the Chinese in 1102. They then negotiated with the
Khitan to aid them to win back their territory lost to the Song. They
appear to have partially succeeded in this with Khitan help by 1106. In
1114 the Chinese resumed their war with the Tanguts and a few years
later they lost their Khitan allies, whose empire in China was
dramatically overthrown by the Tungusic Jurchen invasion (proto-Manchu).
Taking advantage of the chaos that followed the Tanguts led by their
emperor Li Qianshun recovered all their lost territory and also seized
Qingtang from the Tibetans.

This was followed by a phase of sinophilia among the Tanguts where they
established the cult of Confucius and appointed a Chinese commander Ren
Dejing who surrendered to them as a high official. With his internal
Chinese faction he staged a coup to nearly precipitate a civil war after
they threatened to take over the state. He and his Chinese faction were
all killed in 1170 and the Tangut empire’s unity was restored. At that
point with their army at the peak of its size and performance it looked
as though the Tanguts were unconquerable. Indeed, in 1193 the Jurchen
tried to invade them at multiple points along the border but were forced
to retreat. But in 1205 CE they faced a challenge of the kind they had
never faced in their whole existence: Temüjin, who was soon to be
Chingiz Khan. Those who they thought might be a weaker version of their
para-Mongolic cousins the Khitan proved to be something else — within 5
years from first defeat at the hands of the Mongols the mighty Tangut
empire was reduced to vassalage followed by its total destruction.

A notable point about the Tanguts was how they ran a state based on the
bauddha-mata. First, they did not let let come in the way of their
lifestyle, which still had a major pastoralist component. Despite being
bauddha-s the Tanguts permitted eating the meat of dead animals and also
had animal sacrifices in May of each year. However, outside of this
there could be a stiff sentence of hard manual labor for killing a cow,
horse or camel for meat and a lower sentence for killing a donkey or a
mule. Second, as we noted above they did not let it come in the way of
developing a highly militarized state, which was the need of the day in
Central Asia when flanked by all manner of aggressive neighbors.
Importantly, as a counter-religion the bauddha-mata is not very
well-suited for state-forming. In India the rulers with bauddha
orientation could always draw from the bedrock of Hindu institutions and
theory of statecraft for running their kingdoms. The same model worked
where Indians directly transmitted their religion — they also
transmitted their apparatus of Hindu administrative theory, which was
operationally rather effective across different kinds of people.
However, this advantage was not afforded by people who received their
dose of Indian tradition indirectly via intermediates who did not have
the rest of the “package”. This was the initial situation with the
Tanguts. Like their Tibetan neighbors they too gravitated towards
Vajrayāṇa, which of all the bauddha schools had an apparatus closest to
a genuine religion rather than a counter-religion. However, they did
considerably value older bauddha traditions, like drawing just the right
amount of inspiration from the life of the old Maurya emperor Aśoka.
What the Tanguts did was to incorporate the bauddha-mata they had
received within a unique system of statecraft of their own. A part of
this Tangut system was definitely influenced by the Chinese traditions
of legalism and Confucianism. It was from legalism that they likely
acquired their centralizing tendencies: for example, creation of their
own distinct script and the adoption of a unique national hairstyle for
all males. This allowed them to develop a distinctive national identity
despite being a multi-ethnic state with Turkic, Chinese, and Tibetan
peoples in addition to Tanguts proper, themselves with a potentially
composite origin. They were generally quite meritocratic and allowed an
individual of any of these nationalities to occupy high office based on
merit. Indeed, many bauddha Uighurs rose to high positions in their
midst. Only if there were competing individuals of same caliber for a
given rank they gave the first preference to the Tanguts. It was in this
context of dealing with the multiple ethnicities that they used the
bauddha-mata as a religious glue. They, like their contemporary and
earlier Tibetans, also had an interest in incorporating various branches
of secular knowledge into their system. The Tibetans acquired several of
these from the Indians and at to some extant the Tanguts also did so in
terms of medicine. We saw above that they used secular Chinese knowledge
for military strategy. It also appears they developed their own
systematic veterinary medicine with specialists for horses, cows, camels
and ovicaprids. These were called to investigate epidemics of these
animals such that orders to could be issued to prevent consumption of
their meat in these periods. These veterinarians would study wells,
pastures and the carcasses of dead animals to identify the sources of
epidemics and remedy them. Just as in military technology they also
innovated in secular technology developing advanced book-printing
techniques including a version of the movable type.

As a bauddha cakravartin-s, the Tangut emperors starting from Li Yuanhao
showed keen interest in directly studying the bauddha-mata. He initially
took the help of Uighur scholars from the Uighur lands he had just
conquered to produce printed Tangut-language editions of important
mahāyāna texts. Later in his career and during that of the subsequent
emperors they got to directly interact with Indian teachers whom they
patronized at their court. They created an office known as the Saṃgha
office to which they appointed Jayānanda the Indian paṇḍita from Kashmir
as the director. They also sent several students to the Pāla and Sena
schools to study directly with reputed Indian teachers. These introduced
the cult of Mahākāla which started to grow in popularity among the
Tanguts. In the Tangut texts we also have the biography of an Indian
brāhmaṇa teacher known as Akṣobhyavajra, who is said to have studied
both the Veda and the Vajrayāṇa doctrines and completely internalized
the bauddha doctrine. He then came to the Tangut kingdom (likely in the
1100s) and stayed at the Huguo temple where he did translation work and
taught the nāstika [Yoga
tantra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/nastika-notes-2/)-s.
He instituted a ritual of food-charity among the Tanguts. He is
described as a great mantravādin. Another Tangut text on the sādhana of
Bhaiṣajyaguru also mentions “a great Indian paṇḍita” as its teacher and
the Tanguts following his teaching made several paintings of this deity.
Another of fragment of a Tangut text collected by the Russians is a
Chinese translation of the medical teachings an Indian physician.

The Tangut emperors’ self-perception with regard to their place in the
bauddha hierarchy grew with time: starting as cakravartin-s, they soon
conceived themselves as bodhisattva-s, which culminated in them
considering themselves the Buddha of the age just before their
destruction by Chingiz Khan. As self-conscious dharma-pāla-s running a
dharmarājya, they sought to protect the mata in their realm from
vandalism. We get a number of details in this regard from a legal
document discovered among the Tangut texts and studied by Kychanov. It
states that: “Nobody is allowed to steal, spoil or damage Buddha’s
images, temples, images of religious champions, canvases with Confucius’
image or images of gods \[i.e. Hindu deva-s and yakṣa-s transmitted as a
part of the bauddha system\].” Who were these potential vandals against
whom this law was laid down? Evidently it was the Mohammedan vandals
from the neighboring Qarakhanid kingdom, which was carrying out mass
forced conversions of bauddha and shamanistic Turks and sending out
missionaries to their neighboring countries. It was also probably a
defense against iconoclastic Nestorian Christians who were known to be
active in the region. Thus, the Tanguts did probably play some role in
keeping the evils of Mohammedanism from spreading east in Asia at that
time. In this regard the Khitans, however, played a much bigger role
actively crushing mullahs who tried to operate in those regions. It was
perhaps this self-perception as dharmapāla-s that made them acutely
conscious of the mata being a counter-religion at its heart and the need
to prevent competing claimants in the bauddha hierarchy. Already in the
days of Li Yuanhao, he made a strong ideological attack on the Tibetans
claiming to be bauddha-cakravartin-s. Subsequently, they introduced
strict laws to control the propagation of the bauddha-mata in their
realm. Among the laws found in the Tangut legal document are those that:
1. prosecute a preacher for teaching anything that might distort the
mata or mislead people or create social unrest. Thus, all preachers of
the bauddha-mata had to register with the court and obtain clearance for
their sermons before preaching. Failing to do so would result in 3 years
of hard physical labor. 2. In a move against the very natural rise of
bābāistic tendencies among the nāstika-s, any quack claiming to
prognosticate the future or making claims like seeing a divine light
from the Buddha was punished similarly. If he did make people follow him
and pay him for such claims he was put to death. Other socially
disruptive teachings of a lower order received a labor sentence of an
year. The state also regulated who became śramaṇa-s and punished
misbehaving śramaṇa-s who may engage in unauthorized sexual activities
with their female counterparts \[We know from bhaṭṭa Jayanta that this
was the case in India\]. Only those women who were widowed or had no man
showing interest in marrying could register to become a bhikṣuṇī. Thus,
the religion was not allowed to develop parasitic or depraved tendencies
in the Tangut state.

In conclusion, one may infer that the Tangut state was a rather
brilliant nāstika state in East-Central Asia. While it was destroyed by
the Mongols, evidently several of its innovations were taken up by them.
Some Tangut survivors who surrendered to the Mongols were given various
posts: for example Tolui appointed a Tangut woman as nurse for his
children. The bauddha establishment was mostly spared by the Mongols and
played a role in the transmission of the nāstika religion among the
Mongols.

**Introduction**  
Several sub-schools of the Taittirīya school of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda
possess their own collections of mantra-s distinct from their saṃhitā-s
known as the mantra-pāṭha-s. These include mantra-s that are often found
in other traditions but not in their own saṃhitā or brāhmaṇa.
Additionally, they also include some mantra-s which are unique to these
mantra-pāṭha-s. For example the famous Yajurvedic version of the
Śrīsūkta is found in the mantra-pāṭha of Bodhāyana. However, most
practitioners in South India do not correctly use the accents of this
sūkta and seem to be unaware that the KYV version of this sūkta occurs
in this text. The mantra-paṭha-s of the Āpastamba, Bodhāyana, Vaikhānasa
and Hiraṇyakeśin sub-schools have come down to us. The mantra-s in them
are typically deployed in gṛhya rituals directed by instructions from
their gṛhyasūtra-s. However, the Vaikhānasa-mantra-pāṭha is distinctive
in having a late terminal part that is used in the iconic worship of
Viṣṇu by the Vaikhānasa-s. The Hiraṇyakeśī-mantra-pāṭha has a ṛk-saṃhitā
as part of it and is used by the Hiraṇyakeśīn-s of Maharashtra and Tamil
Nadu in their rituals to this date. In someways this is reminiscent of
the hautra-pariśiṣṭha of the Āpastamba-s that is used by Yajurvedin-s to
supplement the role normally performed by the Ṛgvedin hotṛ.

Other than these mantra-pāṭha-s of the KYV, we also have comparable
supplementary mantra-collections among the Sāmavedin-s in their
Mantrabrāhmaṇa and the famous khila of the RV. Further, beyond the
Taittirīya school, the Kaṭha school, which was once widespread in the
northern parts of the subcontinent like Kashmir and the Panjab, had it
own mantra-paṭha that went along with their gṛhyasūtra, namely that of
Laugākṣi. While the original form of this mantra-paṭha does not survive
to my knowledge, a version of it with accretions of tāntrika and
paurānika material used in smārta practice by the brāhmaṇa-s of Kashmir
and some of their counterparts in Himachal Pradesh has come down to us.
This text was published by the Kashmirian brāhmaṇa-s Keśava Bhaṭṭa and
Kāśīnātha-śarman in the first half of the 1900s. I had earlier examined
a defective version of this text but thanks to the massive text-scanning
effort of the eGangotri Trust of the texts at the Kashmir Research
Institute, Srinagar we can now examine a better version of this text.

The melding of tāntrika and vaidika tradition found in this Kashmirian
text has a long history in Hindu tradition. Indeed, as we have pointed
out before\[footnote 1\], a small mantra-saṃhitā comparable to the
mantra-pāṭha-s is found preserved in the śākta-purāṇa, the Devī-purāṇa,
which might preserve a distinct vaidika tradition. Similarly, the
Āṅgirasakalpa of the Paippalāda school of the Atharvaveda preserves a
combined mantra-deployment of Paippalāda AV mantra-s along with
tāntrika-vidyā-s. With regard to the AV tradition one may also point to
the Tripurārṇava-tantra, an authoritative mūla-tantra of the Śrīkula
tradition. The
![20^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=20%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
taraṃga of this text preserves a combined tāntrika-vaidika
mantra-deployment for the Indramahotsva (the great festival of Indra)
which associates itself the AV. This association is likely genuine for
the AV is the one vaidika tradition that has clear injunctions for the
Indramahotsva in its pariśiṣṭha-s. This section of the
Tripurārṇava-tantra specifies several vaidika mantra-s that are to be
used in the worship of Indra and other deva-s, which are combined with
the worship of the Bhairava of the Śrīkula tradition under the tāntrika
scheme.

Our Kashmirian text associated with the Kaṭha school, like other
mantra-paṭha-s, has some unique Vedic material. One such is the
Bhadrasūkta which is the topic of this note. This sūkta of 22 ṛk-s is to
our knowledge not found in any other saṃhitā. It is mostly comprised of
regular jagati-s (12-12-12-12), with the last ṛk being a triṣṭubh
(11-11-11-11). There may be some hypermetrical verses like ṛk-17
(12-12-12-13). The sūkta has a form rather similar to the RV7.35 of
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi. Like that one it is a vaiśvadeva-sūkta, which
invokes the entire pantheon for luck or felicity. In RV7.35 the word for
luck or felicity is the indeclinable śam. In our sūkta the word bhadra
is used instead. It is used as an adjective that declines as the deity
being invoked with the dative pronoun naḥ (“for us”) being used just
like in RV7.35. Hence, in this sūkta we translate bhadra as auspicious
(or can be taken in the sense of the deity being luck-granting). This
word bhadra is also found in multiple ṛk-s of another famous
vaiśvadeva-sūkta, RV1.89 of Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, in an equivalent sense (ā
no bhadrāḥ; devānām bhadrā sumatir ṛjūyatāṃ; bhadraṃ karṇebhiḥ śṛṇuyāma
devā bhadram paśyemākṣabhir yajatrāḥ). More generally, the pattern of
the repetitions of bhadra is seen on multiple occasions in the RV albeit
not in vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s (e.g. RV8.62 of Pragātha Kāṇva) and also in
the AV saṃhitā-s. A ṛk of Sobhari Kāṇva (RV8.19.19) also uses the word
bhadra repeated in a sense similar to this sūkta:  
bhadro no agnir āhuto bhadrā rātiḥ subhaga bhadro adhvaraḥ \| bhadrā uta
praśastayaḥ \|\|  
For us auspicious Agni when he is made an offering, the auspicious gift,
the auspicious ritual, you the giver of good luck, \[for us\] auspicious
hymns of praise.  
Another comparable word is svasti (“well-being”) used in a similar sense
by the Atri-s in their vaiśvadeva-sūkta, RV5.51.11-15 and also by Gotama
Rāhūgaṇa in RV1.89. Indeed, in the Kashmirian tradition the Bhadrasūkta
is used on conjunction with RV1.89 and RV5.51.11-15. This style
continues into the epic period where we observe Kausalyā confer a
blessing on Rāma using a comparable incantation with svasti ( in R2.25).

The pantheon of the Bhadrasūkta is entirely Vedic with no paurāṇika
features. This squarely places the sūkta within the classic vaidika
tradition and it was perhaps even originally attached to some now lost
saṃhitā. However, in ṛk-2 we encounter the god Prajāpati. He is not
found in the comparable RV7.35 or other core RV vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s. He
appears to have entered the Vedic tradition relatively late from a
para-Vedic tradition \[footnote 2\]. His position in the sūkta suggests
that he has not superseded the old aindra system as it happened in the
even later Vedic layers. In this regard his position is comparable to
that found the camaka-praśna of the Yajurveda tradition. This suggests
that the sūkta indeed belongs to a comparable relative temporal layer
and was a relatively late composition with the Vedic tradition, perhaps
consciously mirroring the RV7.35 and RV1.89. The final ṛk has the
refrain: “tanno mitro varuṇo mā mahantām aditiḥ sindhuḥ pṛthivī uta
dyauḥ” (Mitra and Varuṇa, Aditi, the river, the Earth and also Heaven
should grant this to us), which is characteristic of the Kutsa-s of the
RV (e.g. RV1.94). Kutsa also has a certain predilection for composing
low complexity sūkta-s, which is also seen rather plainly in this one.
Importantly, his two vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s, RV1.105 and RV1.106, have
characteristic low-complexity style with repetition. Notably, his sūkta
to the Sun (RV1.115) uses the word bhadra repeatedly as in this sūkta.
Together, these indicate that the composer of the Bhadrasūkta was a
member of the Kautsa clan.

Some notable features of the Bhadrasūkta are:

1\. Venas is implored to be ever-desirous (uśan…sadā) of the worshiper.
This furnishes a link between Venas and the later name of Venus in
Sanskrit tradition, Uśanas. Thus, it further strengthens the
identification of Venas with Venus and suggests an early IE origin for
this planetary name.

2\. Mātariśvan is explicitly identified with Vāyu in this sūkta. In the
RV Mātariśvan is often mentioned as bringing Agni to the Bhārgava-s and
humans at large (evidently from Vivasvat). In RV3.29.11 Viśvāmitra
clarifies this identification by stating: “mātariśvā yad amimīta mātari
vātasya sargo abhavat sarīmaṇi \|\|”: \[He is called\] Mātariśvan when
he measures out \[the space\] in his mother; he became the rush of the
wind in flowing out. Thus, we translate Mātariśvan as “he who grows in
his mother” meaning “he who grows in the world-womb.

3\. In ṛk-10 we seen an invocation of various physiological processes.
This is unique for a vaiśvadeva-sūkta and not seen in RV sūkta-s of this
type. In this regard it has a flavor more typical of the AV.

4\. In ṛk-s 12-14 we encounter a great diversity of devatā-dvandva-s,
which is unprecedented in any other vaiśvadeva-sūkta elsewhere in the
śruti.

The emended text of the sūkta is presented below with an approximate
translation.

People who are seriously interested in emergent complexity and pattern
formation might at some point discover matrix expansion for themselves.
It is a version of string rewriting that allows one to create complex
patterns. For me, the inspiration came from the way Hindu temples were
constructed in their phase of maturity and this led me to walking on a
path, which probably several others have done before me. While matrix
substitution is perhaps common knowledge to students of pattern
formation, I am still recording it here in part due to the great beauty
of the patterns that can be generated by this very simple mechanism.

Let us consider the following substitution rules:

![0 \\to \\begin{bmatrix}{} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}; \\; 1 \\to \\begin{bmatrix}{} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1
\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cto+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%7B%7D+0+%26+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+1+%26+0+%26+1+%5C%5C+0+%26+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%3B+%5C%3B+1+%5Cto+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%7B%7D+1+%26+1+%26+1+%5C%5C+1+%26+1+%26+1+%5C%5C+1+%26+1+%26+1+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We initialize the process with
![M_0=\[0\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_0%3D%5B0%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

What these substitution rules do is to replace every 0 and 1
respectively by the indicated matrices in each round. As a consequence
we get an expanding matrix which starts with a single element, which
then grows to a ![M_2: 3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_2%3A+3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
matrix and then to a ![M_3: 9 \\times
9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_3%3A+9+%5Ctimes+9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
matrix and so. Once we arrive at a matrix of a certain size we can
render it as an image by assigning a color to each cell based on the
number it contains. In this case we have two numbers 0,1; hence, our
image would be two-colored. We could have done the same with a ![2
\\times
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or a ![4 \\times
4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
matrix as the substituent. However, these either have too little
diversity or grow too fast to produce nice images on a typical laptop
screen. Unless indicated otherwise all images in this note were produced
by expanding the matrix to a size of ![M_5: 243 \\times
243](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_5%3A+243+%5Ctimes+243&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Applying the above rules initialized as indicated above leads us to the
famous box fractal (Figure 1).

Applying the below rules yields us the famous Sierpinski box (Figure 2):

Applying the below rules yields us an interesting carpet weaving (Figure
5). A search on the internet reveals that a certain Jeff Haferman was
the first to announce this: in any case he arrived at it before my
times.

We can get many other weavings; however, to realize the full potential
of this mechanism we shall now go to higher number of colors. For 3
colors we need to formulate 3 rules and so on. We show below some
carpets and fractals obtained with 3 and 4 colors.

The below rules yield a 3 color carpet (Figure 6):

Not all matrices yield aesthetically worthwhile images. A reader might
experiment with this method to obtain further images.

Consider the equation:

![y^2=x^3+k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2Bk&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

where
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a positive integer 1, 2, 3… For a given
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
will the above equation have integer solutions and, if yes, what are
they and how many?

We have heard of accounts of people receiving solutions to scientific or
mathematical problems in their dreams. We have never had any such dream;
in fact we get most of our scientific or mathematical insights when we
are either in a semi-awake but conscious reverie or at the peak of our
alertness. However, we on rare occasions we have had dreams which
present mathematical matters. On the night between the 18th and 19th of
Jan 2019 we had such dream. It was a long dream which featured human
faces we do not recall seeing in real life: we forgot their role in the
dream on waking. However, what we remembered of the dream was the
striking and repeated appearance of the above equation along with its
solutions for several
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
On waking, we distinctly recall seeing the cases of ![k=1, 8,
9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1%2C+8%2C+9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
though there were many more in the dream. There was a degree of
discomfort from the dream for in the groggy state of waking from it we
knew that some of these solutions had slipped away. So, at the first
chance we got, we played a bit with this equation this on our laptop. We
should mention that we have not previously played with this equation and
have given it little if any thought before: we glanced at it when we had
previously written about the cakravala but really did not give it any
further consideration then or thereafter. Hence, we were charmed by its
unexpected and strong appearance in our dream.

This equation is known as Mordell’s equation after the mathematician who
started studying it intensely about a century ago. The equation itself
was know before him to a French mathematician Bachet and is sometimes
given his name. It has apparently been widely studied by modern
mathematicians and they know a lot about it. As a mathematical layman we
are not presenting any of that discussion here but simply record below
our elementary exploration of it.

[![mordell_fig1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig1.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig1.png)

Figure 1.

These equations define a class of elliptic curves and by definition
given the square term they are symmetric about the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
(Figure 1). Since, we are here only looking at the real plane, the curve
is only defined starting from ![y=0,
x=-\\sqrt\[3\]{k}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D0%2C+x%3D-%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7Bk%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where it cuts the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis.
From there on it opens symmetrically towards
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the direction of the positive
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
So, essentially we are looking for the lattice points which lie on this
curve. Given the square term, we will get symmetric pairs of solutions
about the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis
(Figure 1). In geometric terms, it might be viewed as the problem of
which squares and cubes with sides of integer units are
inter-convertible by the addition of
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
units.

Mordell had pointed out about a century ago that these equations might
have either no integer solutions or only a finite number of them. Let is
consider a concrete example with
![k=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
![y^2=x^3+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One can get three trivial solutions right away: by setting
![x=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get
![y=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, setting
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we get ![y=\\pm
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Further, we see that if
![x=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![y=\\pm
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can write the solutions as
![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
pairs: (-1,0); (0,1); (0, -1); (2,3); (2,-3): a total of 5 unique
integer solutions. Can there be any more solutions than these? To get an
intuitive geometric feel for this we first observe how these solutions
sit on the curve (Figure 1). We notice that the 3 distinct ones are on
the same straight line (also applies to their mirror images via a
mirrored line). This is a important property of elliptic curves (being
cubic curves) that allows us to understand the situation better.

[![mordell_fig2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig2.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig2.png)Figure
2.

In Figure 2, we consider the curve
![y^2=x^3+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in greater detail. We observe that if we have two integer solutions
points
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and we connect them we get the third one
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, if we have two solutions, in this case the trivial ones, we can
easily find the third one by drawing a line through them and seeing
where it cuts the elliptic curve. The point where it cuts it gives a
further solution. We also see from the figure that joining symmetric
solutions like points
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![Q^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will not yield any further solutions because the resultant line will be
parallel to the
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis.
Thus, we might get an additional solution only if the slope of the line
joining the 2 prior solutions is neither
![0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(coincident with the
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis)
nor
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(parallel to
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)-axis).
Hence, we may ask: now that we have
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can we get a further solution? We can see that joining
![Q^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yields a line that will never again cut the curve
![y^2=x^3+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can geometrically see that there can be no more than the 5
above solutions we obtained.

In algebraic language the slope of the line joining the first two
solutions can be written as:

![m=\\dfrac{y_P-y_Q}{x_P-x_Q}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D%5Cdfrac%7By_P-y_Q%7D%7Bx_P-x_Q%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

From this one can calculate the coordinates of the third point
![R](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as:

![x_R=m^2-x_P-x_Q, \\;
y_R=y_P+m(x_R-x_P)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_R%3Dm%5E2-x_P-x_Q%2C+%5C%3B+y_R%3Dy_P%2Bm%28x_R-x_P%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, in Figure 2, if we were to join
![Q^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have:  
![m=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
thus for the “new point” we get: ![x=4-0-2=2, \\;
y=-1+2(2-0)=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D4-0-2%3D2%2C+%5C%3B+y%3D-1%2B2%282-0%29%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
We simply get back
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
indicating that there are no further integer solutions than the 5 we
have.

One may also see a parallel between this procedure of obtaining a third
integer solution by joining two points and the process of obtaining a
composite number by multiplying two prime numbers. If we know the two
starting points it is easy to get the third but if we were to only know
the third point for a large number getting its precursors would be a
difficult task. This relates to the use of elliptic curves as an
alternative for primes in cryptography ([see our earlier note on the use
of prime numbers in the
same](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/10/05/a-laymans-overview-of-the-arithmetic-of-encryption/)).

In the case of
![y^2=x^3+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the joining procedure terminated after the first new point we got but
can there be cases where this yields more points? To see an example of
this let us consider
![y^2=x^3+9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
One can get a trivial solution by simply placing
![x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to get ![y=\\pm

Further, it is also easy to see that by taking
![x=-2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D-2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get ![y=\\pm
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpm+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we get four points that we may call
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![P^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![Q^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)(Figure
3 panel 1). By joining
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get a further point
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, joining
![P^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![Q^\\prime](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%5E%5Cprime&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![R_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get yet another point
![R_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We can likewise obtain their mirror images
![R^\\prime_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cprime_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![R^\\prime_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cprime_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(Figure 3). Finally, by joining
![R^\\prime_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cprime_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![R_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get yet another point
![R_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and likewise we can get its mirror image point
![R^\\prime_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cprime_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Beyond this the joining procedure yields no further points. Thus, we are
left with a total of 10 integer solutions for
![y^2=x^3+9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%3Dx%5E3%2B9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
(-2,1); (0,3); (3,6); (6,15); (40,253); (-2,-1); (0,-3); (3,-6);
(6,-15); (40,-253)

4.

We can then systematically explore the solutions for all
![k=1..1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1..1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
If we plot all solutions and zoom in close to origin we find a dense
clustering of the solutions forming a swallow-tail like structure whose
outline is an integer approximation of an elliptic curve (Figure 4).

[![mordell_fig5](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig5.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig5.png)Figure
5.

We further find that some
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
have no integer solutions at all. There is a formal way to use modulos
and factorization to prove this for particular
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The sequence of
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for which no integer solutions exist can be computationally obtained and
goes as: 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 23, 29, 32… Figure 5 shows how the
![n^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
term of this sequence grows. We find empirically that it appears to be
bounded by or at least approximated by the shape of a scaled form of the
logarithmic integral: ![y=\\pi^2
\\textrm{Li}(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cpi%5E2+%5Ctextrm%7BLi%7D%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Whether this is true or what the significance of it may be remains
unknown to us.

[![mordell_fig6](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig6.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig6.png)Figure
6.

We can also look at the sequence defined by the number of integer
solutions by
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is plotted in Figure 6 and remarkably shows a structure with no
obvious regularity. A closer look allows us to discern the following
patterns:  
1) The most common number of solutions is 0. For
![k=1..1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1..1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
this happens with a probability of 0.549, i.e. more than half the times
there are no integer solutions for Mordell’s equation. The next most
frequent number of solutions is 2. This happens with a probability of
0.306 in this range. These are the cases when you just have two
symmetric solutions differing in the sign of their
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
value.

2\) An odd number of solutions is obtained only when
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a perfect cube. This is because only in this case we get the unpaired
solution of the form
![(-\\sqrt\[3\]{k},0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7Bk%7D%2C0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The cubic powers of 2 are particular rich in solutions. E.g.
![k=2^9=512](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2%5E9%3D512&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
yields 9 solutions: (-8,0); (-7,13); (4,24); (8,32); (184,2496);
(-7,-13); (4,-24); (8,-32); (184,-2496).

3\) If
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is a perfect square then for
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
![k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![k-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we will have at least 2 solutions: for
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have
![(0,\\pm\\sqrt{k})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
for
![k-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have
![(1,\\pm\\sqrt{k})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2C%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
for
![k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have
![(-1,\\pm\\sqrt{k})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1%2C%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This would predict that, taken together, perfect square
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and their two immediate neighbors on either side would have a higher
average number of solutions than an equivalent number of
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
drawn at random in the same range. This is found to be the case
empirically (Figure 7).

[![mordell_fig7](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig7.png)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mordell_fig7.png)Figure
7.

The mean number of solutions of the square
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and their immediate neighbors is 4.108696 (red line in Figure 7) as
opposed to the mean number of solutions of 1.522 (black line) for all
![k=1..1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1..1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The former is 10.42 standard deviations away from the mean for
equivalently sized samples drawn randomly from
![k=1..1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1..1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

4\) Further some squares and square-neighbors show what we call a lucky
cubic conjunction (LCC), i.e. they generate a significantly larger
number of perfect squares when summed with cubes than other numbers. One
such square showing a LCC is
![15^2=225](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=15%5E2%3D225&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It shows the record number of solutions (26) for
![k=1..1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1..1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
(-6,3); (-5,10); (0,15); (4,17); (6,21); (10,35); (15,60); (30,165);
(60,465); (180,2415); (336,6159); (351,6576); (720114, 611085363);
(-6,-3); (-5,-10); (0,-15); (4,-17); (6,-21); (10,-35); (15,-60);
(30,-165); (60,-465); (180,-2415); (336,-6159); (351,-6576); (720114,
-611085363). One can right away see that:  
![-6^3+225=3^2\\\\ -5^3+225=10^2\\\\ 4^3+225=17^2\\\\ 6^3+225=21^2\\\\
10^3+225=35^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-6%5E3%2B225%3D3%5E2%5C%5C+-5%5E3%2B225%3D10%5E2%5C%5C+4%5E3%2B225%3D17%5E2%5C%5C+6%5E3%2B225%3D21%5E2%5C%5C+10%5E3%2B225%3D35%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and so on.

A square neighbor with a LCC is
![17=16+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17%3D16%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which has 8 cubic conjunctions leading to its 16 solutions: (-2,3);
(-1,4); (2,5); (4,9); (8,23); (43,282); (52,375); (5234,378661);
(-2,-3); (-1,-4); (2,-5); (4,-9); (8,-23); (43,-282); (52,-375);
(5234,-378661).

![1025=32^2+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1025%3D32%5E2%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is an even more monstrous square neighbor with a LCC outside the range
that we systematically explored. This number has a whopping 16 cubic
conjunctions giving rise to 32 solutions: (-10,5); (-5,30); (-4,31);
(-1,32); (4,33); (10,45); (20,95); (40,255); (50,355); (64,513);
(155,1930); (166,2139); (446,9419); (920,27905); (3631,218796);
(3730,227805); (-10,-5); (-5,-30); (-4,-31); (-1,-32); (4,-33);
(10,-45); (20,-95); (40,-255); (50,-355); (64,-513); (155,-1930);
(166,-2139); (446,-9419); (920,-27905); (3631,-218796); (3730,-227805).
In my computational exploration of these elliptic curves I am yet to
find any other that out does 1025.

5\) While
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which are squares and square neighbors have at least 2 solutions
guaranteed, in principle a non-square or non-square neighbor number can
show a LCC and give rise to a large number of solutions. One such as
![k=297](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D297&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
which shows 9 cubic conjunctions to give 18 solutions: (-6,9); (-2,17);
(3,18); (4,19); (12,45); (34,199); (48,333); (1362,50265);
(93844,28748141); (-6,-9); (-2,-17); (3,-18); (4,-19); (12,-45);
(34,-199); (48,-333); (1362,-50265); (93844,-28748141).
![k=873](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D873&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also shows a similar LCC, again with 9 cubic conjunctions. Outside the
range we systematically explored, we found
![k=2089](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2089&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to show a remarkable LCC with 14 conjunctions yielding 28 solutions:
(-12,19); (-10,33); (-4,45); (3,46); (8,51); (18,89); (60,467);
(71,600); (80,717); (170,2217); (183,2476); (698,18441); (9278,893679);
(129968,46854861); (-12,-19); (-10,-33); (-4,-45); (3,-46); (8,-51);
(18,-89); (60,-467); (71,-600); (80,-717); (170,-2217); (183,-2476);
(698,-18441); (9278,-893679); (129968,-46854861). This is the second
highest number of solutions we have seen for the Mordell’s equations we
have studied.

A reader might explore these and see if he can find a
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with bigger number of solution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things had cooled off a bit on the political front after the
assassination of the Prime Minister Pratap Simha by a massed drone
attack. On the personal front Vidrum had sort of come to terms with the
mysterious disappearance of his lover Meghana. He was now ever more
convinced that she had been killed by a marūnmatta. He had the vague
sense of possible trouble in the future but for now his duties as a
young physician kept him busy. He had set aside the anger and
indignation that resulted from the disappearance of Meghana and was
following the advise of his precocious junior and professor at the
medical school, Vrishchika, to chart out an appropriate niche for
himself. Thus, he was watching less cricket and spending his free time
looking more closely at the relevant clinical data along the lines
Vrishchika had suggested to him. While he initially found it boring, he
soon felt he was seeing patterns he had never before seen in his life.
This perked him up and he started putting in effort to try to understand
them. In the process he was for the first time trying to read a wider
array of literature with a more critical mind. Suddenly, it was dawning
on him that several of the practices and larger framework of the modern
medical practice itself was mostly not grounded in alleviating the
problems of the patients.

That afternoon Vidrum felt his mind crowded with less-comforting issues.
Perhaps, deep within he had some foreboding that there was only a
temporary lull in the troubles and that a great clash of men was waiting
to happen in the future. Due to the company of his old friends Vidrum
was moving away from the alluring but fallacious ideas of his other
friends like Samikaran, Gardabh and Mahish. In fact it seemed as though
they could no longer be counted as his friends, especially if the
terminal life and death struggle between the dharma and rākṣasavāda was
to play out as Lootika had witnessed in her dream. To add to this
general background of thoughts, the experience with a patient he had to
handle the previous day was playing on his mind – he was hardened to
such sentiments but for some reason this case kept returning to his
mind. It specifically raised a question which had always bothered him in
the background – the thought of whether he had really been a success in
life. He had faithfully followed what his parents had charted for him.
After all the trials and tribulations he had been successful at that but
it was not entirely clear to him if had truly met ‘success’. His parents
were extremely proud of where he had reached in life but he was not
entirely sure if that meant anything at all. On the other side his mind
wandered with some happy expectation to the impending appointment he had
early that evening. He had been invited to Indrasena and Vrishchika’s
house for hanging out for the evening and dinner. Indrasena’s younger
brother Pinakasena and his wife Shallaki were also on vacation with them
for a few days. But then his mind wandered back to the issue of
achievement when he thought of the people whom he was slated to visit
that evening. Nevertheless, knowing that time was short he quickly made
some lemonade and ṣaṭṭaka -s that he wished to take to his hosts to
accompany the dinner they were spreading.

On arriving at Indrasena and Vrishchika’s house he was introduced to
Pinakasena and Shallaki. He had met Pinakasena once before when he and
his brother had come from their city, the sprawling Kshayadrajanagara,
to stay with his classmate Somakhya for a fortnight. They refreshed
their acquaintance. Vidrum: “I recall the the great game of cricket we
had at Somakhya’s house.” IS: “Ah you have a good memory. It seems to
have faded away from my ken but perhaps one us might have have a record
of it in our scrapbooks.” Vrishchika: “Indrasena, it has to be your
scrapbook for certainly me and my sisters did not join you all to play
cricket of all things. I guess the only thing Indrasena remembers from
that trip was meeting me, the walk we all took to that gigantic palm
tree – a rare one for our city, which even towered over the specimens we
might encounter in Visphotaka or Samudragandha, and that memorable
dinner we had at the Hotel Yadava.” Vidrum chuckled: “I can imagine.”
Pinakasena: “Ah, I do recall the good cricket we played. Indra batted
badly and bowled badly throughout. Vrishchika, while you were not
physically there, I think you can take the blame for that. I think bro
was only thinking of you even while playing.”

Vrishchika: “You guys are always blaming me even when I was not
there!”  
Vidrum: “But, Vrishchika, you were always a big trouble-maker, right?”  
Vrishchika: “I thought that title squarely belonged to my elder sister:
after all on the last day of school our principal said that I was such a
well-behaved girl, unlike Lootika who was always into mischief. OK
Vidrum, why don’t you now inaugurate the goṣtḥī with some of the
nimbūka-rasa that you have so kindly brought us. Lootika and Varoli
always considered me and Jhilleeka as inferior cooks. Even if that were
true, you would not have to suffer that, for much of the bhakṣa for
today has been handled by honorary sister Shallaki, whom even Somakhya’s
mother has certified as good. So let me get you some of her modaka-s to
get going.” Vidrum: “It is very brahminical indeed: bhojya and bhakṣya
with no trace of onions or garlic. I get that feel of purity.”

Vidrum: “So Shallaki do you also originally hail from
Kshayadrajanagara?” Shallaki: “No, I come from Shodasharajya
(Ṣoḍaśarājya).” Vidrum: “Hmm, an out of the way, quite place. I am sure
the air was cleaner than our mahānagara and the life much quieter. How
did you find the education there?” Shallaki: “You are right with regard
to the air and the charming life of a small town but regarding education
there was nothing much to speak of. I must say that situation was quite
nice too for in the village of the blind the one eyed woman is queen.”
Vidrum: “What do you mean?” Shallaki: “In our town there was not much
competition as you had in your city, both in school and in college. So
by just putting in a little effort I could stand out in academics and
boost my ego. That might have done me some bad but thankfully I got see
reality upon running into the caturbhaginī.”

Vidrum: “Interesting that you say so. I have been thinking a lot on
related issues. Imagine being in school with likes of Vrishchika and all
her sisters! It certainly was a stiffer situation for us, especially
given all the pressure my parents put on me to catch up with the rest. I
understand from Indrasena that Kshayadrajanagara was only a little less
stressful than our city.”

Pinakasena: “Indrasena and I made the following estimates using data
from Vrishchika and Shallaki. The average IQ of your college class,
Vidrum, was approximately 120-123; in Kshayadrajanagara in mine and
Indra’s class it was 116-119. In Shallaki’s college in Shodasharajya it
was just 103. But remember in the general populace across all our
regions the average is at best around 90. Now you can also look at it
this way. In a mahānagara like yours there were roughly around 250000
students who would have written the university entrance exam with you.
If we take all the medical colleges in the district there are
approximately 200 government rate seats available to the open category.
Now not all students with that high IQ threshold needed to make it to
the medical school will want to study medicine. About the same number
will want to go to engineering school. About ¼ that number will go to
law school. Another ¼ will want to become accountants and go on the
track peculiar to them. It will only be a rare minority like Indra or
me, say one each year, who would drop out of those professional courses
to take a pure science degree. That will give us approximately 500
students and a fraction of 0.002 who pass the IQ threshold to
potentially enter medical school. Now with that mean of 90 for our
general populace and a typical standard deviation of about 15 we can
calculate that threshold to be an IQ of 133.17. Now, if we take your
class of about 120 students with a mean IQ of 121.5 and a similar s.d
then you have about 26 students in your class alone who could go for
those seats. Whereas in my class there would have been roughly 18 such
students and in Shallaki’s only 3. So indeed it must have been quieter
for her than for you.”

Vidrum: “Yes. I would believe your estimates are anecdotally in the
right range given that there were little over 10 people in my class with
IQs in the 140 and above range. In that range the difference really
tells with respect to even the mean for our class. It can be
demoralizing to those lower down the ladder as the case of a patient I
had to deal with yesterday illustrates.”  
Vrishchika: “Talking of patients, I was itching to ask about patient
#29?”  
Vidrum: “Yes, I was thinking of that very case. First, I must thank you
for your spot on and immediate diagnosis: as I had expected it was
something up your alley.”

Vrishchika: “So you confirmed mycetism ?”  
Vidrum: “Yes indeed: it was an attempt of suicide.”  
IS: “Mycetism from a suicide attempt?”  
Vidrum: “The young patient was brought it with an emergency situation.
He presented profuse perspiration, miosis in an eye, accompanied by
ptosis in the other, convulsions and difficulty breathing among other
things. After we struggled a bit since the patient was not orally
communicative, I went over to check with your wife, as such are the
things she might see through instantly. She was quick to take a shot
that it was likely muscarinic intoxication. I acted on it and found that
he had attempted suicide by shroom and stabilized him with atropine.”  
Vrishchika: “Tragic, but that’s an unexpected twist. Why would someone
attempt suicide via something so inefficient and painful as a muscarinic
mushroom? He could have tried something else that might have brought his
end more efficiently. Remember the guy in our school who committed
suicide with Mercuric Chloride?”  
Vidrum: “It is indeed an odd choice of an agent. But regarding the pain,
remember that when people are in such a state they do not care much
about the pain: leave alone that
![HgCl_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=HgCl_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
case, we have had people make an attempt at suicide by drinking phenol,
right?”  
Indrasena: “Remember, access to agents is not always easy.
![HgCl_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=HgCl_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is not exactly something easily available unless he has access to the
chemistry lab in school or college. Moreover, Vrishchika, you might be
underestimating the potential of muscarinic intoxication. During my
peregrinations in the ghats with a naturalist, I came across a large
bolete mushroom, likely of the *Rubinoboletus* group. My naturalist
companion informed me that it was particularly toxic and used by the
hill pastoralist-subsistence farmers to impose a death-punishment on
life-stock thieves whom they caught. They were said to prepare a
mushroom-bun using this fungus and administer it to the thieves who
would then die in their custody within 24-36 hours. I collected a sample
and it is in my storage. However, after realizing its active principle
is mostly just muscarine, I did not investigate it further.”

Vidrum: “That’s most interesting. This young patient’s surname suggests
that he might have his origins in the shepherd community. I wonder if
after all he was doing what he did with some prior knowledge but simply
did not dose correctly. That’s why we were able to salvage him with
atropine and adrenaline.”  
Vrishchika: “Vidrum, here you have a notable case at hand, which you
should carefully work up into a manuscript and publish it – it will make
an interesting case report. Hope you have all the material
well-documented.”  
Vidrum: “Yes I do. I hope we can get Indra’s sample to do some tests for
muscarine.”

Shallaki: “Very outre indeed but perhaps it is my low IQ that I am
unable to see what was it in this case that made Vidrum think of ones
place on the IQ ladder.”  
Vidrum: “This is the time of the results for the university entrance
exams. The patient very badly wanted to make it to medical school but he
came up against mathematics and pulled the plug in it. The failure led
him to attempt self-destruction. It reminded me of my own situation
years ago. My parents had, from an early age, nailed it into me that the
way forward in life was to have the initials MD engraved next to my
name. They placed tremendous pressure on me to reach that goal. It was
tough struggle at the university entrance exam: just as Pinakin laid out
I was competing with the IQ heavyweights in our class for that small
slice of seats. My parents naively thought that just putting in hours of
work would take me there. Looking at your clans-folk, Somakhya and
Lootika, or the nasty Hemaling, I got my first doubts about whether this
was true. I asked Somakhya one day about this and he said: ‘don’t slack
on your studies but it will mostly boil down to what your parents gave
you at conception. Knowing you well, I think you will survive but then
the gods or luck can always have other plans.’ Thankfully, that turned
out to be true and the gods favored me, But then time and again I was
reminded that there is something more than just the work you put in or
the education your receive. In fact it was this which lead to me
breaking up with Manjukeshi and falling out with Samikaran.”

Vrishchika: “That’s where realism might help. It might be a good idea
not to force people who do not have it in them to become doctor but do
something else which could still make their lives cheerful. An animal
can lead a happy life without having fathomed the depths of calculus or
the arcana of enzymology or peering down infected orifices: it is good
to know that early rather than commit yourself to misery with no pay
off.”  
Vidrum: “Vrishchika, I have always felt you speak from a lucky vantage
point, as you were undoubtedly the most intelligent student, male or
female, in your class all the way from school to the end of your
education. How else could we explain that just in your first year you
aced several of the exams of the last year? Should you not be having
some consideration for the aspirations of the less-fortunate rather than
seeking to write them off at birth?”  
Shallaki: “I think we all are speaking from a lucky vantage point.
Otherwise we would not all be here together chatting in this manner. I
think neither you nor anyone else in this room can really experience the
world in first person as it is for someone at the mean IQ of a 90 or for
that matter even someone at 100, at or below which 3/4th of our people
are situated. Hence, I would not at all say that Vrishchika has no
consideration for the less-endowed in this dimension due her advantage.
She is only advocating a realistic approach where we do not whip a horse
without the wherewithal in hope that it might win a difficult race. That
said, I do acknowledge that slotting someone as a low intellectual
achiever, perhaps at birth itself, might discourage them from achieving
even what their potential might hold for them. This is a difficult
dilemma when you want implement something humane for society at large.”

PS: “In fact the likelihood of a more humane approach stems from first
recognizing the ground situation. We need not follow fashions of the
Abrahamistic Occident to shape our thoughts, which is one of a fear of
reality and multiplicity – be it in religion or in society at large. In
our tradition we have always had a more realistic picture of human
nature and the existence of substructure within it. Hence, we need to
work from what is actually there rather than what we think should be
there. In fact, rather than write off people, such a realization might
help provide the right kind of assistance and prior information for
them, rather than make them play to lose.”

IS: “Then we were in school, the wife and I were part of a study to use
a gigantic compendium of single nucleotide polymorphisms to study the
correlations of each with a bunch of quantitative traits like muscle
mass, tendency for psychotic conditions, brain size and general
intelligence. By adding these correlations we were able to develop
polygenic scores that were rather predictive of these quantitative
traits. In fact, due to the enormity of the data sets that were accrued
we were able to do better than any prior attempt. Vrishchika is now
extending the results to include observations such as the orientation of
the dendritic arborizations in smart people with big brains with respect
to the duller folks with smaller brains. The regular arrangement of the
dendritic arborizations is a reasonable predictor of intelligence. As
you know, to be a commissioned officer in the army requires you to pass
a pretty rigorous test that probes general intelligence. However, the
non-commissioned servicemen are not selected via such stringent
procedure. But the army as part of its modernization plan was very
interested in probing this aspect for it has serious bearing on
performance and training. In fact general intelligence is a good
indicator of whether a javān will be trainable for something important
in modern warfare than just being a grunt. Thus, the army supported this
study and has made good use of our polygenic scores as a predictive
tool. Of course they do not substitute it for an intelligence test;
however, it informs them of the kind training they should invest in for
a javān and the specialization they should deploy them in. The
predictions of psychoses also informs them regarding the types of
posting and training that might be appropriate for an individual. The
way it works is they all have equal opportunity but if they fail the
given opportunity then this information guides the future steps that are
taken.”

Vidrum: “That is interesting. I can see something like this being of use
in the army. Due to your wife, I am also beginning to utilize risk
scores in civilian medicine for a variety of conditions and it does help
me sharpen the advise I can give my patients. But can we really do any
good using the brain size and polygenic scores for general intelligence
among civilians?”  
Vrishchika: “The army project is the one which actually convinced me of
the utility of the polygenic scores for intelligence in civilian
medicine. I actually advised the army in this matter and saw it to have
utility in routine military medicine. I am sure you would agree Vidrum
that the medical counsel for a patient is not a simple matter. Many
actions a patient needs to follow in order to successfully take modern
medication is not exactly simple for someone closer or below the mean in
the IQ distribution. For instance, take management of diabetes or
something even simpler like taking the medications appropriately as
instructed. In such a situation the polygenic score gives us a
non-invasive prediction of whether the patient’s intelligence would be
sufficient to handle the task of auto-administration of the prescribed
medication. If we get an indication that it might not then we might
recommend some extra training, take some extra-steps and provide some
additional aids to ensure that they correctly auto-administer.”

Vidrum: “Alright that sounds like something interesting and certainly I
need to take a closer look at it. But I am still worried about the
misuse of tests of general intelligence or still worse a polygenic
prediction, especially in education. What about the psychological trauma
derived from knowing that you have bad polygenic score? We could have
more cases like our patient #29 then.”  
Shallaki: “While I completely see your point of the potential
educational misuse, as Indrasena pointed out regarding the army, I think
there is also potential for the converse. One thing that has emerged
from intelligence studies is that a person with a certain low IQ score
can be trained by repeated specific instruction by example to do certain
tasks as well as a higher IQ person. However, such people are
less-likely to benefit much from abstract higher general education
unlike a higher IQ person. Hence, I would say that we should start by
giving an equal opportunity and encouragement for all. However, if a
person is showing a tendency of failure we can make an assessment of the
prospects and the potential training course for the individual based on
the polygenic score. Learning Newton’s laws of motion or principles of
linguistic evolution are not for everyone. If we have a good evidence
that their intelligence is not up to it then it is actually a good thing
not to make them waste their time with such things but train them more
practically for matters likely to give them a respectable life.”

PS: “This brings to mind a conversation we had with Indra’s classmate
and Somakhya’s cousin Saumanasa who used to think everyone has the same
intelligence, sort of like your evil Samikaran. The results of Indra and
Vrishchika really shook her up. She was wanting to go the route of ‘the
universal right to income for these people until robotics and artificial
intelligence would aid them catch up with the rest.’ We were trying to
tell her that a typical man values a dignified life coming from being
employed more than an income without work and those who do go that route
are likely to end up with serious issues like substance abuse and
violent crime.”  
Vidrum: “It is interesting she puts a positive spin on robotics. The way
automation and robotics are entering our lives I think life is getting
harder for these people with lower IQ. I sort of started sympathizing
with a famous advaitācārya, who is sort of a Luddite, who felt that we
should turn our backs to mechanization and automation.”  
PS: “I think the jury is still out on that one. I see that smarter ones
projecting even greater power with the artificial computer minds. Yet I
admit that those with lower intelligence are to an extent doing certain
otherwise difficult tasks by themselves nowadays because of the
computer’s mind aiding them with information in a more ready to use
form. For example, in our parents days people had to look up a table for
the very normal distribution we have been talking about but we can
simply do it at the tap of a finger due to the extended mind in the form
of our computers. Looking up some of those tables was a more complex
task making such information less accessible to many.”

Vidrum: “Well, Samikaran is still laboring under the belief that all are
equal in the upper story and is probably still serious about his ‘Trash
the Brahmin’ project since he believes that all inequality has arisen in
our people due to ‘brahmins’ denying them education. But what about
engineering the genetics to change the potential? Did Saumanasa not
suggest that one?”  
Indrasena: “I am sure Saumanasa would love to see samatvam too. But she
is a human geneticist herself and actually knows a thing or two of the
matter. The main issue is that we are dealing with a quantitative trait
with a polygenic foundation. So it is not something for easy
intervention. There are some loci that we ourselves uncovered from a
study of a big-brained family of V1s, which by themselves can give a
good effect but even those are tricky. In fact the Qin Shi Huang’s merry
successors acted almost immediately after we published our analysis of
PAX6 and delta-catenin to engineer a Crispr Ding and a Crispr Dong based
on those variants. They were big-headed no doubt but apparently the
intended super-Hans are not doing too well according to the latest
intelligence we have gotten. There is something about the genetic
background, which we figured out only much later, that they missed. All
this, I guess, is keeping Saumanasa from venturing in the direction of a
genetic intervention and preferring an artificially engineered one. ”

Vidrum: “If this were the scenario on the ground I wonder what this
might mean for the differences that have been claimed for the mean IQ of
nations. Evidently the data is already there to explore its causes and
consequences, right?”

Cultures with an Indo-European background have had a long history of
symbiosis with the bovine animal since they started herding on the
steppes in the Black Sea-Caspian region. Indeed, the very emergence of
the modern steppes of Eurasia is likely a result of human-animal action
to foster a certain pattern and type of grass growth. Hence, not
surprisingly, cows frequently appear even in their mathematical
literature, like the Greek problem of cows attributed to Archimedes or
Nārāyaṇa’s cow population problem. Even after the destruction of
Indo-European tradition by Abrahamism in groups like the English such
problems persisted and once such example is Newton’s problem from his
*Arithmetica universalis*. It goes thus:  
![a_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cows graze
![b_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
fields bare in
![c_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
days,  
![a_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cows graze
![b_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
fields bare in
![c_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
days,  
![a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cows graze
![b_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
fields bare in
![c_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
days,  
What relationship exists between the 9 quantities from ![a_1, a_2,
a_3...c_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3...c_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)?

To solve this we must make some assumptions that Newton indicates in his
work: 1) On an average the cows and fields are equivalent. That would
mean that we can take each cow to eat the same amount
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
daily and each field to have the same type and amount of grass
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Grass, ungulates and fungi are in a complex relationship. Grass “hire”
fungal symbionts to produce toxins like the ergot alkaloids to deter
ungulates. There is some empirical evidence that grazing by ungulates
triggers grass growth. So we get the assumption: 2) The grass is not at
standstill while being grazed daily but is growing back at a daily rate
of
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

From the above, for the first set of cows and fields, we have
![b_1x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the total amount of grass at the start of the grazing. The amount of
grass growing on the field in day 1 would be ![b_1\\times 1 \\times
y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%5Ctimes+1+%5Ctimes+y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The total amount of grass eaten by the
![a_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
cows at the end of the day would be ![a_1\\times 1 \\times
w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%5Ctimes+1+%5Ctimes+w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, we can calculate the amount of grass at the end of day 1 as:
![b_1x +1b_1y -
1a_1w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x+%2B1b_1y+-+1a_1w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
At the end of day 2 we get:
![b_1x+2b_1y-2a_1w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x%2B2b_1y-2a_1w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and so on.  
Hence, when the fields are grazed bare in
![c_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
days we get:
![b_1x+c_1b_1y-c_1a_1w=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x%2Bc_1b_1y-c_1a_1w%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By writing
![z=-w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3D-w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we get the equation:
![b_1x+b_1c_1y+a_1c_1z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x%2Bb_1c_1y%2Ba_1c_1z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Similarly, for the other two sets of cows and fields we get the
equations:
![b_2x+b_2c_2y+a_2c_2z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2x%2Bb_2c_2y%2Ba_2c_2z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![b_3x+b_3c_3y+c_3a_3z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_3x%2Bb_3c_3y%2Bc_3a_3z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
We thus have as set of 3 simultaneous equations in 3 variables:

![b_1x+b_1c_1y+a_1c_1z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1x%2Bb_1c_1y%2Ba_1c_1z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![b_2x+b_2c_2y+a_2c_2z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2x%2Bb_2c_2y%2Ba_2c_2z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![b_3x+b_3c_3y+c_3a_3z=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_3x%2Bb_3c_3y%2Bc_3a_3z%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We can hence eliminate ![x, y,
z](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y%2C+z&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
using the determinant of the system ![\\det A=

![\\det A = \\begin{vmatrix} b_1 & b_1c_1 & a_1c_1 \\\\ b_2 & b_2c_2 &

If one wants to avoid ![\\det
A=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdet+A%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
being obtained for solutions: 1) where the amount of grass eaten by a
cow is
![w=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
2) negative values for
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or
![w](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
we have to set further constraints:  
![a_1, a_2,
a_3...c_3\>0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3...c_3%3E0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

In Newton’s original numerical example the matrix of the 9 values is:

![\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\\\ a_3 & b_3 &
c_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 36 & 10 & 12 \\\\ 63 & 30 & 27
\\\\ 162 & 108 & 54 \\end{bmatrix}
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+a_1+%26+b_1+%26+c_1+%5C%5C++a_2+%26+b_2+%26+c_2+%5C%5C++a_3+%26+b_3+%26++c_3+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D++36+%26++10+%26+12+%5C%5C+++63++%26+30+%26+27+%5C%5C++162+%26+108+%26+54+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This yields:

There seems to have been a error in Newton’s original copy of this
problem which he corrected late in his life. A question that comes to us
is: Is there some easy algorithm for generating such valid integer
nonads and is there some pattern to them?

The map proposed by R. Lozi over 40 years ago is one of the simplest two
dimensional maps that exhibits chaotic behavior and generates a wide
range of interesting structures. The map may be defined thus:

![x\_{n+1}=1-a_1\|x_n\|+y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D1-a_1%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=a_2x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_2x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
where ![a_1,
a_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are real parameters.

We have discussed our explorations of this map at some length
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/).
At that point we also discussed our discovery of certain
[generalizations](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/some-simple-maps-specifying-strange-attractors/)
of this class of maps. In course of the quest for the generalized
[Lozi-like
maps](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/deliberations-on-richness-and-beauty-discovery-of-some-multi-parameter-iterative-maps/),
we discovered another generalization remarkable for the diversity of
forms it produced. We held back from presenting it because we wished to
investigate its geometry further. As a result we are now able to explain
the basic geometric determinants of the map; however, there are other
aspects that still remain mysterious to us. Hence, we are presenting
this map with whatever understanding we could arrive at along with the
issues that are still open questions for us. They are maps of great
beauty; hence, they are also worth beholding for the sake of their
aesthetics.

This map is defined thus:  
![x\_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3\|x_n\|+y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=
a_4-x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4-x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Alternatively, we can also define it as:  
![x\_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3\|x_n\|-y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C-y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=
a_4+x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4%2Bx_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are real parameters: ![a_2 +
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2+%2B+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is in the range
![(-2,2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-2%2C2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(see below for explanation), while we explored ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
primarily in range ![(-1.01,
1.01)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1.01%2C+1.01%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as this is the range where there is higher tendency for the map to yield
chaotic attractors. If we take the first definition then the map is
bilaterally symmetric about the axial line
![y=-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It we take the second definition it is similarly symmetric about the
axis
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For the below discussion we refer only to the first definition because
the second one shows comparable behavior with change in signs of some of
the parameters.

To explore the basic geometric principles behind the attractors
generated by this map we started with a set of 200 equally spaced
starting points ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
all of which lie on the circle ![x=\\cos(t),
y=\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With each starting point the map was iterated 2000 times. Then the
evolution of each starting point under the map was plotted in one of 11
different colors. We were able to determine the following rules for the
structure of these attractors:

1\) The most important determinant of the geometry of the attractor is
sum of the parameters ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
When ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are closer to 1 and ![a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow
2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3+%5Crightarrow+2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![p,q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Cq&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are mutually prime integers, we get a p-ad structure in the attractor
(e.g. Figure 1).

takes successively, by row, the following 4 pairs of values (-0.5450419,
0.1); (-0.2450419; -0.2); (-0.7450419, 0.3); (-0.9450419; 0.5) . In each

This determines the central heptad structure but the rest of the
attractor shows considerable variability that cannot be explained in a
straightforward way from these parameters.

the p-ad structure in the attractor tends to be retained (Figure 3).

thus, we get a core with a heptad structure.

square structure in the core of the attractor (Figure 4). This is

we see a loss of the p-ad structure or a flattening of the attractor
along the axis of symmetry from the top left side (Figure 5).

we notice that the pentad structure has been lost with flattening along
the axis of symmetry.

These are the basic rules by which the core structure of the attractors
can be accounted for. The parameters ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be seen as scaling parameters whereas ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be seen as rotational parameters. The latter pair sets up the
rotational structure based on how close their sum approaches
![2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is the cosine principle that occurs as the primary
structure-determinant in other chaotic maps, including maps which we
discovered and discussed before
([1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/the-geometric-principles-behind-discrete-dynamical-systems-based-on-the-generalized-witch-of-agnesi/),
[2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/03/25/the-remarkable-behavior-of-a-map-displaying-derived-from-a-simple-model-for-a-biological-conflict/)).
As in the previously discussed cases, this sets the limits of
![a_2+a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as (-2, 2); however, here there is greater scope for diversity because
the cosine principle is distributed over the sum of two separate
parameters. Beyond the cosine principle,n these attractors exhibit
additional features whose origins remain mysterious to us:

1\) For example, In Figure 3 in addition to the core heptad one can see
additional harmonics like a 11-ad, 18-ad and 29-ad structures. What is
the explanation for them? In the previous examples of chaotic maps we
could explain higher harmonics based on other
![\\tfrac{p}{q}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
whose
![\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
might lie close to the primary cosine. However, in this case the 11-ad,
the 18-ad and 29-ad correspond to no such cosines. Hence, their
emergence remains a mystery.

2\) Further, there is an effect of the starting ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which can result in the appearance of a n-ad structure independently of
the cosine principle (Figure 6).

In both the above cases the four parameters ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are respectively, -0.567115129642189, -0.761931293738961,
-0.347582505706949, -0.069076271019876. However, the left panel was
initialized with a circle of radius 0.9 and the right panel was
initialized with a circle of radius
![\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Only in the second case we see the emergence of a heptad structure,
which cannot be accounted for by the sum of ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The role of the starting ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in generating n-ad structures is another open question.

To further explore the diversity of chaotic attractors within the
above-stated parameter space for the 4 parameters of the map we set up
our code to search for such maps thus:  
1) We set ![x_0=0.3\\cos(\\pi/4), y_0=
0.3\\sin(\\pi/4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0.3%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2F4%29%2C+y_0%3D+0.3%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2F4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the starting point.  
2) We then randomly generated a set of parameters ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

3) For each such set we allowed ![(x_0,
y_0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2C+y_0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to evolve for 1000 iterations under the map. If the evolution resulted
in the divergence to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or convergence to one or few point attractors, then we discarded those
parameters.  
4) A heuristic for chaos is that very small differences in the initial
conditions can result in very different end results upon evolution under
the map after a certain number of iterations. Hence, for those
parameters which survived the above filters we tested if a second ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which differed from the first by
![10^{-7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in each coordinate diverged from the evolutionary path of the original
![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
after the same number of iterations. If it did so, the parameter set was
retained as it was the sign of being on a chaotic attractor.  
5) These surviving parameter sets were then explored more fully by
studying the evolution of 200 equally spaced points on the circle
![x=0.3\\cos(t),
y=0.3\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0.3%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D0.3%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for 2000 iterations of the map.

We present below few examples of attractors emerging from the above
procedure with parameters listed in order from

This attractor assumes of the form reminiscent in some ways of the
gingerbread man seen in the classical Lozi attractor. The gingerbread
man has a “heart” in the form a five-lobed structure with a ellipse
within it.

surrounded by 9 further pentads. An explanation for the emergence of
these pentads and the 9 fold harmonic however remains elusive.

The yuga between 1800 CE and 1900 CE saw a remarkable change in our
understanding of the world at many levels. It is not that some of these
ideas did not exist long before that time but they came together in a
world-system of science and philosophy in that period. Part of this
change can be traced to multiple disparate events that interestingly
happened in the year 1859 CE — a time when our nation had sunk to what
was perhaps the lowest points of its existence. Due that our nation
could not fully participate in the cataclysmic consequences of those
events until some time later and the Hindu elite have still not fully
internalized the significance of those events.

**The Big**  
The mathematical foundations of mechanics laid by Newton with deep roots
in Euclidean geometry had met with near infallible success. The
physicists drunk with confidence of the triumph of Newton believed that
they could account for all physical phenomena based on that mathematical
formulation. But it was ironically this very mathematical formulation
that was to point that something was amiss. The great Carl Causs had
shown how with just three observations one could calculate the orbit of
a celestial body and used this recover the asteroid Ceres which had been
lost after going behind the sun. Gauss’s student was Johann Encke, who a
few years after his graduation developed methods to calculate the
perturbational effects of various celestial bodies on the orbits of
other such bodies. It was these methods that led to his discovering the
period of a comet that latter came to be known as the famed Encke’ Comet
and his other great works on cometary orbits.

Following on the path of Encke’s methods, the great French mathematician
Urbain Le Verrier came to be “the man who discovered a planet with the
point of his pen”, as his colleague called him. By performing complex
and painstaking calculations of Newtonian mechanics he showed that the
orbit of Uranus could not be explained by the known data and proposed a
new planet to explain it. Not just that, he predicted where that planet
would be in the sky pointing to a location at the boundary of
Capricornus and Aquarius. With no Frenchmen showing interest in testing
his prediction, he sent his predictions over to Encke at Berlin. But the
day Encke received Le Verrier’s letter was his birthday and he had
organized big party for the evening rather than an observation session.
Moreover, he was much more of a man of mathematics than an observer. By
some coincidence, he had recently had his former doctoral student Carl
Bremiker make excellent new star maps of the Aquarius-Capricornus region
for the observatory. Further, Encke’s assistant and former student
Johann Galle had sent his doctoral dissertation to Le Verrier for
comments and this letter from Le Verrier contained the comments on that
in addition to his note on the prediction of a new planet. Thus, with
Encke not observing, Johann Galle and his student Heinrich d’Arrest got
to use the telescope that night of receiving the Le Verrier’s letter.
They discovered Neptune with
![1^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
degree of the position he had predicted. When we saw Neptune for the
first time after quite some difficulty with our small refractor, we were
able to appreciate the triumph of Galle. This was the ultimate triumph
of Newtonian mechanics and Encke fittingly wrote to Le Verrier: “Your
name will be forever linked with the most outstanding conceivable proof
of the validity of universal gravitation.” By this Encke meant the
Newtonian theory of gravitation.

But there was something ironic about Le Verrier’s life’s work. Before
his study of Uranus leading the prediction Neptune, he had worked on the
other end of solar system, where the elusive Mercury orbits, which these
days the ordinary urban man rarely catches a glimpse of (I remember all
the times I’ve seen it). Going through calculations involving hundreds
of terms he calculated an excess of precession for the orbit of Mercury
which could not be accounted for by Newtonian mechanics (September
![12^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
1859). While the same trick of postulating an additional planet or other
anomalies were tried, none of them really worked. Ironically the
universality of Newtonian gravitation, which Encke thought Le Verrier
had proven, now stood to be surpassed. This of course took a while to
happen but seeds had been sowed by the new geometry of Bernhard Riemann.
This laid the foundation for Einstein’s theory which came in the next
century. At the same time as solving the excess precession problem of
Mercury, Einstein as also predicted the existence of gravitational
waves. Observations of binary pulsars in 1974 indirectly suggested he
was right. With the direct detection of gravitational waves in the
current century of the common era this prediction of Einstein has
finally received its direct confirmation. Thus, one of the pillars of
physics in the realm of the “big” was established.

\[As an aside, talking of Riemann 1859 was also the year he published
his famous paper establishing the relationship between the zeroes of the
![\\zeta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Czeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
function in the complex plane and the distribution of the prime
numbers.\]

**The Small**  
The 21 year old Gustav Kirchhoff, while still a student, discovered his
famous laws of electrical circuits, which any student who has studied
elementary high-school physics would have encountered. This was just the
beginning of what was to be a remarkable career spanning multiple
branches of science and mathematics. Continuing with his electrical work
he showed that in a resistance-less wire the electricity would flow at
the speed of light. This important result formed the bed-rock of
electromagnetism that was taken to conclusion JC Maxwell. He then worked
with Robert Bunsen to develop spectroscopy and it was as part of this
work that in October of 1859 CE that he reported his observations on how
the D-lines in the solar spectrum are further darkened when passed
through a Bunsen burner flame with sodium. These observations culminated
in Kirchhoff’s famous spectroscopic laws:  
1) An incandescent solid, or a liquid or a gas under high pressure
produces a continuous spectrum, i.e. like a rainbow of colors.  
2) A gas under low pressure produces an emission spectrum, i.e. one with
bright-lines of specific frequency.  
3) A continuous spectrum when viewed through a cooler low-density gas
produces an absorption spectrum, i.e dark lines are seen superimposed on
the continuous spectrum. These correspond to the bright lines produced
when the same substance is heated and producing an emission spectrum.

The frequency
![\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
at which the absorption or emission lines are seen depends on the
substances emitting or absorbing light and the temperature to which they
are heated. Further, by the end of 1859, using the rather elementary
device of the below thought experiment, Kirchhoff arrived at a basic
theorem for the continuous spectrum:

Let
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and
![P_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be 2 isolated, infinite, opaque (do not allow transmission energy
through them) plates (as caricatured in Figure 1) in thermodynamic
equilibrium, i.e. they are at the same absolute temperature
![T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the inflow of energy and outflow of energy into either plate is in
balance. Let us even assume they are made of different materials as
indicated by the different colors in Figure 1. Let us consider the
following for a particular frequency of radiation
![\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Let ![a_1,
a_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the absorptivity of the 2 plates, i.e. the amount of radiant energy
absorbed per unit time per unit area. Let ![e_1,
e_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2C+e_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the emissivity of the 2 plates, i.e. the amount of energy they
radiate per unit time per unit area. Now the some of the energy incident
on them is absorbed while the rest is reflected. This defines the
respective reflectivities as ![r_1=1-a_1,
r_2=1-a_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1%3D1-a_1%2C+r_2%3D1-a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Now, for
![P_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the outflow of energy per unit time per unit area is
![e_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Being in thermodynamic equilibrium it is in balance with its inflow

We can analyze

and the chain continues *ad infinitum*. Thus, we can write the first

Thus, irrespective of the material composition of the plates, their
ratios of emissivity to absorptivity are the same. Since this analysis
was done for a given frequency of radiation ![\\nu =
\\tfrac{1}{\\lambda}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(where
![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the wavelength of the radiation) at a certain equilibrium temperature
![T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
we can say that the above ratios are function of these:  
![\\dfrac{e_2}{a_2} = \\dfrac{e_1}{a_1}= f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7Be_2%7D%7Ba_2%7D+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Be_1%7D%7Ba_1%7D%3D+f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now Kirchhoff postulated a theoretical body, termed the black body, that
absorbed all energy incident on it, i.e.
![a_1=a_2=a_b=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Da_2%3Da_b%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, for such a black body the emissivity would be ![e_b=f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_b%3Df%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
i.e. it would be purely a function of the frequency of the radiation and
its temperature. This immediately presented the physicists of the age
with two challenges: 1) An experimental one, i.e. to construct a
radiating body that approximates the black body as closely as possible
and to empirically measure the shape of ![f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
2) A theoretical one, i.e. to derive from a theoretical model of
radiation the shape of ![f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

These challenges proved more revolutionary than physicists of the time
thought. In 1869 CE one of the greatest physical theorists of all times,
Ludwig Boltzmann, was appointed full professor of mathematical physics
at the age of 25. Starting that year for the next two years he spent
some time studying with Bunsen and Kirchhoff whose findings we have just
alluded to. Deeply inspired by the discussions with them on
thermodynamics, he went on to provide a statistical framework to explain
the second law of thermodynamics in 1872 CE. Most European physicists of
that time, unlike the chemists, did not consider the atomic theory to be
real. Boltzmann not only considered atoms to be real (spherical atoms
formed the foundation of his work on the second law) but in this work he
introduced the idea of discrete energy levels. Later to the shock of the
attending physicists in 1891 CE at a conference in Halle, Boltzmann
emphatically stated: “I see no reason why energy shouldn’t also be
regarded as divided atomically.” It was these ideas that were to provide
the ultimate solution to Kirchhoff’s challenge.

On the experimental side it took about 20 years for the first glimmer of
understanding to emerge with regard to ![f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
namely that it has one clear maximum when plotted against
![\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which moves to lower
![\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
with decreasing T. Finally, in 1896 CE, Hermann von Helmholtz’s student,
Wilhelm Wien, proposed the first reasonable function to account for this
shape. It took the form ![f(\\nu,
T)=a\\nu^3e^{-b\\nu/T}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29%3Da%5Cnu%5E3e%5E%7B-b%5Cnu%2FT%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where ![a,
b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are constants. In terms of its basic shape it resembled what was
empirically known for ![f(\\nu,
T)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and the experiments by Paschen around that time suggested that indeed
Wien had found the right curve for the black body radiation. However,
new and more precise experiments at lower frequencies soon poured water
on this. These experiments were being done by the groups of Lummer and
Pringsheim on one hand and Rubens and Kurlbaum on the other at what
where probably the best experimental physics labs in world at the dawn
of the 1900s. They indicated that the function of Wien failed at lower
frequencies.

The final solution to the problem came from the dark horse among the
physicists, Max Planck, who had fittingly taken the professorial chair
of Kirchhoff upon his death. This chair at Berlin was first offered to
Boltzmann, who declined it; with no one taking it, finally it was given
to Planck. He had a solid background having studied physics with
Kirchhoff and von Helmholtz and mathematics under Weierstrass, who was
second in line of academic descent from Gauss. Till the age of 40 he had
done competent work in thermodynamics but was most part ‘scooped’ by the
great American mathematician and inventor Josiah Gibbs, whose work in
turn paralleled that of Boltzmann to enter the textbooks. Despite all
this, Planck had for long set his mind on the bigger goal of deriving
the correct shape of the black body radiation curve. Ironically,
throughout most of this phase Planck was in the “wrong team”, opposing
the atomic theory. As of 1897, Planck was still disputing the
statistical framework of Boltzmann based on atomic principles. In
response, Boltzmann published a paper showing that Planck’s objections
were untenable and wrote that: *“It is certainly possible and would be
gratifying to derive for radiation phenomena a theorem analogously to
the entropy theorem from the general laws for these phenomena using the
same principles as in gas theory. Thus, I would be pleased, if the work
of Dr. Planck on the scattering of electrical plane waves by very small
resonators would become useful in this respect, which by the way are
very simple calculations whose correctness I have never put in doubt.”*

This rebuttal of Boltzmann brought about the gradual conversion of
Planck over the next 3 years. His long-standing wish came to fruition
fatefully on a Sunday afternoon in the autumn of 1900 when the family of
Rubens who had done the black body radiation experiments visited the
family of Planck. Rubens told his host about his latest experimental
results with respect to the black body radiation measured for low
frequencies and its departure from Wien’s proposal. That very evening
Planck drawing on his deep study of Kirchhoff’s fundamental problem
arrived at correct formula for the black body radiation function:  
![f(\\nu,
T)=\\dfrac{a\\nu^3}{e^{b\\nu/T}-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cnu%2C+T%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5Cnu%5E3%7D%7Be%5E%7Bb%5Cnu%2FT%7D-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![a,b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are constants.

and radiance.

Over the next two months, backed by his profound knowledge of
thermodynamics, his strong mathematical capacity, the “conversion” he
had undergone due to Boltzmann and the inspiration from those very
methods of Boltzmann he arrived at the quantum theory where energy is
emitted and absorbed in “atomic” packets or quanta. The energy
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of these quanta is described as
![E=h\\nu](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%3Dh%5Cnu&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
where
![h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is Planck’s constant. In the following years its power was demonstrated
by Einstein who explained the photoelectric effect using the same
theory. Thereafter, Niels Bohr used the same in combination with
inspiration from Darwin’s grandson’s studies to arrive at the first
quantum model of the atom. The rest as they say is history: thus, the
second pillar of physics in the realm of the small was established.

When my father first read out a basic version of this story to me when I
was a kid I was profoundly inspired to study the quantum theory to the
extent my meager mathematics allowed me when I grew older.

**Order and disorder**  
In the late 400s and the beginning of the 500s of the common era the
great Hindu scientist Āryabhaṭa-I devised several mechanical devices,
which were powered by gravity and/or flowing water. One of these was the
svayamvaha-yantra in which the water flowing out of a water clock under
gravity caused a sphere to rotate around its axis once in 24 hours. This
was meant as a teaching device to illustrate the apparent rotation of
the heavenly sphere. Over hundred years later, in 628 CE, Āryabhaṭa’s
successor and antagonist Brahmagupta, apparently in a bid to outdo him,
claimed to have devised a svayamvaha-yantra which was a perpetual motion
machine (ajasra-yantra). It was supposed to operate with gravity acting
on mercury and buoyancy alternately working to keep a spoked wheel
moving for ever. Evidently, this device did not work as expected
prompting his successors, like Lalla and Bhāskara-II, to attempt various
modifications and alternate designs to arrive at something which worked.
While the real goal was obviously not attained, in India these failed
attempts were part of a tradition of constructing genuinely working
mechanical devices culminating in king Bhojadeva’s automata — a
tradition which did not survive the ravages of Mohammedanism. However,
its transmission to West Asia appears to have seeded the quest for
perpetual motion machines in Europe upon transmission of these ideas via
the Mohammedans.

While from today’s vantage point the quest for these machines might look
like a sign of lunacy, the ultimate realization that perpetual motion
machines are untenable needed the recognition of the laws of
thermodynamics. This had to wait for long time and arose from
meditations ensuing from the eventual invention of the steam engine in
Europe. First, the Englishman Joule’s recognition that work and heat
were manifestations of an equivalent quantity, i.e. energy, led to the
first law of thermodynamics. This law is essentially the law of
conservation of energy: *energy can neither be created nor destroyed but
only converted from one form to another*. This law negated the
possibility of having a perpetual motion machine that did work without
an equivalent input of energy.

As the English were taking full advantage of their engines driven by the
heat energy from burning coal to run their business, their neighbors the
French grew increasingly anxious. This prompted the brilliant military
engineer Sadi Carnot from a learned French clan to carry out the first
theoretical study of the principles behind the engines. His penetrating
investigation completed by the time he was 27 more or less laid the
foundations of thermodynamics. Subsequently, he suddenly went mad at the
age of 36 and died from cholera shortly thereafter. Due to the
contagious nature of the disease many of his works were buried with him
but what survived was his famous work on the cycle of an engine. He
recognized that for an engine to run it needed both a heat source from
which it took heat to perform work and a heat sink at lower temperature
than it to dump some of that heat that was not converted to work. While
the source was rather obvious in the practical steam engines starting
from those devised by James Watt, the sink was not — it was merely the
ambient surroundings in which the engine operated. Carnot went on to
show the maximal efficiency an engine depended on the temperature of the
source and the sink. Let
![Q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the heat the engine takes from a source at (absolute) temperature
![T\_{so}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7Bso%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Let
![T\_{si}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7Bsi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
be the temperature of the sink. Then the maximal work that can be done
in a cycle of the engine is

![W=Q\\left(1-\\dfrac{T\_{si}}{T\_{so}}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%3DQ%5Cleft%281-%5Cdfrac%7BT_%7Bsi%7D%7D%7BT_%7Bso%7D%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This is the famous Carnot equation that indicates that not all heat can
be effectively converted to work unless the source was at infinite
temperature or the sink at absolute zero, neither of which are feasible
options.

It is this inability to get all the heat to perform work which poses an
additional constraint that negates even a lower form of perpetual motion
machine, namely one which conserves energy but at least keeps running
forever by cyclically converting one form energy into another. Two noted
scientists of the age, Lord Kelvin and Rudolf Clausius (second in line
from Gauss via Dirichlet with whom he studied mathematics) formalized
Carnot’s discovery by the middle of the 1800s as a law:  
*“No cycle in which heat is taken from a hot source and converted
completely into work is possible”* -Lord Kelvin  
*“Heat does not flow from a body at low temperature to one at high
temperature without an accompanying change elsewhere.”* -Rudolf Clausius

These became the basic statements of the second law of thermodynamics.
Clausius furthered this to define an entity termed entropy. He defined
this such that the change in entropy multiplied by temperature specified
that portion of heat which could not be converted to work. This led him
to state the second law in a rather different way but ultimately
entirely equivalent to the above statements:  
*The entropy of the universe increases during of any spontaneous
change.*  
Here a spontaneous change is one that occurs automatically, i.e. without
needing any external work to be done for it to happen, e.g.: 1) when a
compressed gas is released into an empty container of larger volume it
*spontaneously* expands to occupy that volume. 2) A hot metal piece
placed at room temperature cools to the same temperature.

This statement of the second law provided a deeper insight into the
nature of entropy. For instance, let us consider the above example of
the gas expansion: the gas occupying a smaller volume is more ordered.
This can be expressed in probabilistic sense: The probability of find a
gas molecule in a given unit of volume is higher in this state than when
it spontaneously expands on being released into a larger empty
container. Here the gas molecule moves over a larger space and the
probability of finding the molecule in same unit volume decreases. Thus,
the gas gets more disordered. Thus, entropy can be seen as a measure of
disorder and the second law stated as: *“matter and/or energy tend to
get more disordered.”* The formal description of this idea had its roots
in a discovery of the great James Clerk Maxwell in a distinct
investigation, namely the function describing the distribution of the
velocities of molecules in an ideal gas, again interestingly published
in 1859 CE. In course of developing this abstraction further Boltzmann
formulated his celebrated formula for the absolute entropy of a
substance in 1877 (in the modern form given by Max Planck):  
![S=k_B\\log(W)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3Dk_B%5Clog%28W%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Here,
![k_B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is Boltzmann’s constant in energy and inverse temperature units and
![W](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the total number of ways in which atoms, molecules or energy elements
can be arranged in the sample such that the total energy remains
constant. Each such arrangement that fulfills this condition is termed a
“microstate”. Thus,
![W](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the total number of microstates in the sample. This simple
formulation has profound implications for it allows one to connect the
entropy of a sample to the probability of occurrence of each of the
arrangements of the “atomic” entities in the sample:

![S=-k_B \\displaystyle \\sum_i p_i
\\log(p_i)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3D-k_B+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_i+p_i+%5Clog%28p_i%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here
![p_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
the probability with which microstate
![m_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
occurs in the sample.

While this is a thermodynamic concept, one can now extend it to be the
general measure of disorder of any system. This can be illustrated with
an often-used example: say, on a national day we have large assembly of
people. First, consider state-1: When the national anthem is being
recited they all stand up in an erect posture and recite the same. Next
state-2: once the anthem is over they might adopt a range of different
postures with various conversations between individuals or small groups.
Thus for a beholder of this system in state-1 the population is ordered
and the information coming out from them is clearly perceived and
limited (just the national anthem). In state-2, the population is
disordered and information coming out from them is not easily perceived
as it has a high degree of complexity being the sum of all the many
individual conversations taking place. Thus, the abstract generalization
of the thermodynamic entropy concept not only gives a general measure of
disorder but also the information content of a system. It was this key
generalization that Claude Shannon arrived at almost 70 years after
Boltzmann’s initial discovery. His historic formula to quantify
information essentially took the same form as Boltzmann’s formulation of
thermodynamic entropy, just that Shannon’s is a pure number:

![H=-\\displaystyle \\sum_i p_i
\\log_2(p_i)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D-%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_i+p_i+%5Clog_2%28p_i%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here
![p_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the probability of the symbol
![s_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in a certain symbol set occurring in the string
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus, Shannon entropy specifies the minimal number of bits per symbol
needed to encode the string
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in binary form. Hence,
![H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
also measures the complexity of a string
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
As an example let us consider the following strings in the ASCII symbol
set:  
![S_1=](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%3D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
rAma rAma hare hare;

![S_2=](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_2%3D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

One notes that
![S_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
has higher Shannon entropy than
![S_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and provides quantitative evidence for the intuitive idea that the
second string is more complex than the first. This remarkable link
between the mathematical formulations of two rather disparate entities,
one a description of very palpable quantities like matter and energy and
the other an abstract quantity, information, can be summarized by
quoting Shannon:

*“Quantities of the form ![H=-\\sum p_i
\\log_2(p_i)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D-%5Csum+p_i+%5Clog_2%28p_i%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(the constant
![k_B](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_B&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
merely amounts to a choice of a unit of measure) play a central role in
information theory as measures of information, choice and uncertainty.
The form of
![H](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
will be recognized as that of entropy as defined in certain formulations
of statistical mechanics, where
![p_i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the probability of a system being in cell
![i](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of its phase space.”*

Shannon’s formulation of entropy as a measure of information has
profound implications for understanding the foundations of life. This
aspect has been of great importance in our own investigations and will
touched upon in the final section. Before heading there we may ask if
there is a deeper link between the thermodynamic and informational
conceptions of entropy? That is a question which remains more
mysterious. However, in that regard we will merely quote a noted
scientist of our age, Murray Gell-Mann (compare with the above example
of the people assembled for the national day):

*“In fact, entropy can be regarded as a measure of ignorance. When it is
known only that a system is in a given macrostate \[gross state of
matter and energy in the sample\], the entropy of the macrostate
measures the degree of ignorance about which the microstate system is
in, counting the number of bits of additional information needed to
specify it, with all the microstates in the macrostate treated as
equally probable.”*

We will conclude this section by merely mentioning some even more
mysterious issues pertaining to the two laws of thermodynamics. Emmy
Noether, probably greatest female mathematician of all times, proved a
remarkable theorem now known as Noether’s theorem. A basic version of
this theorem can be relatively easily understood by someone with junior
college mathematics. However, in its more complete forms it extends into
rarefied heights of mathematics. This basic version depends on the
Lagrangian formulation of another great mathematician Joseph-Louis
Lagrange to describe a physical system. Simply put the the Lagrangian of
a system
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is the difference between its kinetic energy
![T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(not to be confused with the symbol for temperature) and potential
energy
![U](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):  
![L=T-U](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3DT-U&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The Lagrangian
![L](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is typically expressed as a function of the position
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of a body in the system and its time derivative, i.e. velocity
![v=\\tfrac{dx}{dt}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
As a simple example, consider the Newtonian system of a body of mass
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
raised to some height dropping under a uniform gravitation field with
acceleration
![g](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It would have kinetic energy ![T=\\tfrac{1}{2}m \\cdot
v^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dm+%5Ccdot+v%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
and potential energy as ![m\\cdot g \\cdot
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5Ccdot+g+%5Ccdot+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Thus its Lagrangian can be written as:

![L(x,v)=T-U=\\tfrac{1}{2}m \\cdot v^2-m\\cdot g \\cdot
x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28x%2Cv%29%3DT-U%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dm+%5Ccdot+v%5E2-m%5Ccdot+g+%5Ccdot+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, according to Noether’s theorem if
![L(x,v)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28x%2Cv%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
of a physical system remains unaffected upon transformation in the
coordinate system used to describe it, i.e. its symmetric under the
transformation, then there will be a corresponding conservation law.
Now, if a physical system is translated linearly to a different position
and there is no other physical influence acting on it, its
![L(x,v)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28x%2Cv%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
remains unaffected. This implies that the translational coordinate
system is a uniform; thus, translational symmetry of the Lagrangian
gives us the law of conservation of momentum. Similarly, that
![L(x,v)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28x%2Cv%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is unaffected if the system is translated in time gives us the law of
conservation of energy or the first law of thermodynamics. Thus,
remarkably conservation of energy is related to time symmetry, i.e. time
being an orderly or uniform coordinate system — time does not flow fast
and slow at different points along its flow. If that were to happen then
energy would not be conserved.

Most physical laws are agnostic to flipping the time coordinate system,
i.e. time reversal. For example, if we flipped time on the flight of an
arrow from release to fall, there will be no changes to the laws of
motion describing it. Similarly, if the time axis were flipped there
would be no difference to the laws describing the revolution of planet
around its star or the current in a circuit. As per Noether’s theorem if
the Lagrangian of a system were unaffected under time-reversal then
entropy would be conserved. But this is not so because it violates the
second law of thermodynamics. So, it is the one physical law that has an
inbuilt time direction, and is thus the odd third pillar of physics. The
measurement of entropy gives us the “arrow of time” to use Eddington’s
term. The young universe was very hot in a narrow energy range with
energy and matter uniformly distributed. This was a low entropy state.
With time the energy and matter become less uniformly distributed with
clumping to form galaxies and their constituent star systems. Thus, the
increasing entropy resulted in a complexity (if viewed in terms of
information) of its structure. Thus, the state of the universe as
described by its increasing entropy and hence information might be seen
as a reflection of its “unfolding” along the arrow of time.

**Lessons from life**  
The final event pertaining to 1859 CE whose consequences we shall talk
about happened on 24th November of that fateful year: Charles Darwin
published “*On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or
the Preservation of favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*”. One may
go as far as to say that modern biology was born with that event. Till
then biology was a science without a theoretical scaffold unlike physics
or chemistry. The other events described in this note, however profound
in their implications, had lesser social and intellectual impact than
this book of Darwin. On the social front it shook the foundations of the
Abrahamistic religions like nothing else coming from science. On the
intellectual front it unsettled more thinkers than any other scientific
publication. The implications of this evolutionary theory were quite
completely grasped by Darwin; however, even its junior co-discoverer
[Wallace](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/06/18/did-wallace-completely-understand-evolution/)
did not fully grasp all its implications, leave alone several of the
other intellectuals at and after that time. Indeed, the situation is
rather peculiar: while much of biology done since then can be seen as a
footnote to Darwin, a large fraction (at least
![50\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=50%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002))
of the biologists do not fully understand the evolutionary theory and
how to use it.

It is not commonly understood that the evolutionary theory has a close
relationship to Shannon’s generalization of entropy as a measure of
information. Its tremendous predictive power stems from this aspect. The
way to understand this can be briefly described thus: the sequence of a
biopolymer (nucleic acid or protein) is replicated by a replicator or
synthesized by a synthetase using another as a template. This in
principle produces identical copies of the biopolymer or a single
polymer with repeats of the same sequence. If we thus align the sequence
of the identical copies of these biopolymers then the Shannon entropy of
a column in the alignment will be zero — i.e. there is no disorder.
However, this replication process is not always perfect; hence over time
copies would emerge with changes along the sequence (mutations). Thus,
the column-wise entropy will keep increasing. What natural selection
does is: 1) to prevent increase in entropy of certain columns or 2) be
blind to differing degrees to the entropy increase in certain columns or
3) favor increasing entropy of certain columns. These three modes of
action are commonly seen as 1) purifying selection; 2) weak selection or
neutrality; 3) positive selection.

Now, the one thing in biology that lies beyond the entropy principle but
still has some relation to it is the semantic principle: Each of the
three above types of action relates a certain biological/biochemical
meaning of the given residue in the biopolymer. This semantic aspect of
the biopolymer sequence is what is the unique “domain” of biology, even
as the semantic aspect of a linguistic sequence is the unique domain of
a text. As an illustration let us consider the following peptides from
*Homo sapiens*:  
Oyxtocin: CYIQNCPLG;
![H=2.9477](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D2.9477&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
R-Vassopressin: CYFQNCPRG;
![H=2.9477](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D2.9477&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
Both these peptides have the same length of 9 amino acids and the same
Shannon entropy. However, the first one is primarily involved in
signaling reproductive functions like birthing, bonding and lactation
whereas the second is involved in regulating water-balance, primarily as
anti-diuretic hormone. Thus, even though they have the same information
content their biological semantics have diverged as they diverged from a
common ancestor.

Yet, entropy does impinge on semantics in a general sense. To illustrate
this let us consider a linguistic example first:  
![S_1=](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%3D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002):
dhiyo yo naH prachodayAt;
![H=3.6258](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D3.6258&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![S_2=](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_2%3D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
buM buM buddhAya buM buM;
![H=2.8675](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D2.8675&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

The two linguistic strings above are both the same length but without
knowing anything else, by just comparing the entropies of the two we can
state that by itself
![S_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is likely to have greater semantic complexity or richness of meaning
than
![S_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
By the same token, let us look at two equal-length parts of a protein,
the *Drosophila* Antennapedia, which binds a specific DNA sequence and
initiates the development of a specific aspect of the animal body plan
along the antero-posterior axis:

    TNGQLGVPQQQQQQQQQPSQNQQQQQAQQAPQQLQQQLPQVTQQVTHPQQQQQQPVVYASCKL

![H=2.634](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D2.634&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

    RKRGRQTYTRYQTLELEKEFHFNRYLTRRRRIEIAHALCLTERQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKENKTK

![H=3.6612](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%3D3.6612&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, just comparing the entropies of the two parts of the protein we can
say that the first has lower complexity than the second. Thus, the
second is more likely to be the functionally more important or involved
part of the protein. If you were then asked to guess which part was more
likely to perform the specific DNA-binding function then the second part
would be the obvious choice. Of course the power of this method
increases with an alignment of multiple sequences for here we are
exploiting not just the entropy distribution but also the effects of
natural selection on it. Thus, natural selection acts on the increasing
entropy of the biopolymer alignment to retain some of it and discard the
rest based on what its semantics are. Thus, with a single sequence using
the entropy measure across the sequence, we can infer which part of it
is likely to fold into a globular structure, which part might be
unstructured or fibrous or if might be embedded in the membrane. With an
alignment of sequences we can additionally tell which protein would be
an enzyme, what are its active sites and some aspect of its catalysis if
it were an enzyme because the biological semantics are based on the
ground of chemistry. However, beyond this one would require empirical
approaches.

Thus, the biological semantics place limits on the predictive capacity
of its foundational theory. In this sense the situation is quite
different from the role of the underlying physics in astronomy (e.g.
stellar evolution) or chemistry. Further, say if we take DNA
replication, the bacteria have one primary DNA polymerase, archaea and
eukaryotes other ones with independent origins from the bacterial one.
Why that particular DNA polymerase became the primary enzyme of a
particular superkingdom does not currently seem to be accountable purely
from theory. It could simply boil down to the microscopic events, i.e.
the local dynamics of selection acting at the time of the fixation of
the polymerases. One could then call it historical contingency, though
we currently do not know that for sure. If this were the case then
prediction from the foundational theory in biology has certain limits in
terms of what it can do by itself and the rest is contingency. Is this
comparable to the questions in physics like why the electron’s mass is
what it is? That is also not clear to us.

Nevertheless, the idea of the action of natural selection on the
products of entropic diversification leads us to the realization that
this principle is more general. Indeed, the evolutionary process of life
through natural selection and the emergence of structure in the universe
can be compared. With regards to the universe, as noted above, the early
phase was low in entropy with more uniform distribution of matter and
energy. As the entropy increased various alternative configurations of
matter and energy emerged. The physical laws dominant in these new
matter-energy regimes now “selected” for certain configurations like
first the atoms of hydrogen and then those of heavier elements. Further,
the laws in the regime of what had by then emerged as chemistry selected
for certain atomic combinations, i.e. molecules. At the macroscopic
level, they selected for formation of galaxies and stars. This gave a
certain temporal sequence for the evolutionary process. The basic set of
galaxies with their globular clusters were produced only once and new
ones are not forming like in that initial phase. Instead, the old ones
are maintained and what is happening is the stellar evolution within
those galaxies which had formed long ago. With regard to the stars
themselves, formation of those with very low metallicity happened only
at certain early time and could not repeat in the second generation as
the stellar nebulae were already seeded with heavy elements.

We believe that a similar entropic process is reflected in the emergence
of life as we know it. First, we do not see life forming afresh again
and again on earth: all of life we know of had a single origin, which
might have not been on earth. In fact, the observation that the archaeal
and bacterial lineages, while having a common origin, had a phase of
genetic separation where there was no sign of the commonplace lateral
transfer of genetic material. Thus, after a common origin on a distant
source there was likely a phase of spatial separation followed by
independent seedings on earth. Second, the study of the proteins in
extant organisms points to a “big bang” when a great section of the stem
lineages of all currently present protein domains were produced. We do
not see evolutionary “bangs” of that magnitude happening again. Thus, we
posit that the entropic diversification resulted in temporal layering —
i.e. the early diversity was never reproduced. The diversity that
emerged in the early phase was acted upon by natural selection to give
rise to the stem lineages of all the major old protein domains. Since
then selection has been for a good part playing the role of maintenance
of the old lineages with only sporadic completely new innovations. This
might be compared to the above-mentioned situation with galaxies and
intra-galactic stellar evolution in the universe at large.

**Epilogue**  
It would be almost banal to state that events set rolling in 1859 have
had profound influence on our current way of thinking. It is story of
towering intellectual heroes who covered themselves in glory one hand
and forgotten foot soldiers on the other comparable to any great
military endeavor. For some of them the end came before they could see
the full glory of their findings: Riemann was dead at 39. JC Maxwell was
dead at 48. The great Boltzmann penetrated many realms and caught
glimpses of others like the treatment of space-time in special
relativity and the use of Riemann’s geometry. But by 1906 madness was
gripping him and he committed suicide that year. Planck lived a long
life of nearly 90 years but for a good part of his life he had
difficulty coming to terms with the theory he had birthed. Four of his
children died as adults during his own life. However, it is hard to
relate to most of them at a personal level as they come from a very
alien culture and religion. In any case one can still relive some of
their glory moments by re-tracing their scientific paths.

The aftermath of these upheavals brought a lot of drama to science.
There was a golden age of physics which seems to have slowed down closer
to our times with the three pillars still standing firm but no
underlying unification yet in sight. In biology the situation is more
peculiar. On one hand, from the “tradition” of Darwin there arose a
certain mathematicization which really did not bring much insight in
terms of biology — not surprising given the weakness of the
philosophical foundations of this particular direction. On the other
hand, many practicing biologists themselves often labor on with a poor
understanding of what old Charles had so clearly expounded and blunder
into dark ditches. However, those who understand its depths can
penetrate the biological science.

Any philosophical system that fails the recognize and engage the
consequences of these upheavals is likely to be in deep trouble. For the
followers of the sanātana dharma a start in these directions was given
long ago by traditions of the great Kaṇāda and Pāṇini but somewhere down
the line they chose more sterile paths. In some sense these upheavals
may be seen as a return of those principles of the great ancients in a
modern guise.
