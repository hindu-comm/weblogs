The map proposed by R. Lozi over 40 years ago is one of the simplest two
dimensional maps that exhibits chaotic behavior and generates a wide
range of interesting structures. The map may be defined thus:

![x\_{n+1}=1-a_1\|x_n\|+y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D1-a_1%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=a_2x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_2x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
where ![a_1,
a_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are real parameters.

We have discussed our explorations of this map at some length
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/).
At that point we also discussed our discovery of certain
[generalizations](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/some-simple-maps-specifying-strange-attractors/)
of this class of maps. In course of the quest for the generalized
[Lozi-like
maps](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/deliberations-on-richness-and-beauty-discovery-of-some-multi-parameter-iterative-maps/),
we discovered another generalization remarkable for the diversity of
forms it produced. We held back from presenting it because we wished to
investigate its geometry further. As a result we are now able to explain
the basic geometric determinants of the map; however, there are other
aspects that still remain mysterious to us. Hence, we are presenting
this map with whatever understanding we could arrive at along with the
issues that are still open questions for us. They are maps of great
beauty; hence, they are also worth beholding for the sake of their
aesthetics.

This map is defined thus:  
![x\_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3\|x_n\|+y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=
a_4-x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4-x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Alternatively, we can also define it as:  
![x\_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3\|x_n\|-y_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C-y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y\_{n+1}=
a_4+x_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4%2Bx_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Here ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are real parameters: ![a_2 +
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2+%2B+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
is in the range
![(-2,2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-2%2C2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
(see below for explanation), while we explored ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
primarily in range ![(-1.01,
1.01)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1.01%2C+1.01%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as this is the range where there is higher tendency for the map to yield
chaotic attractors. If we take the first definition then the map is
bilaterally symmetric about the axial line
![y=-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
It we take the second definition it is similarly symmetric about the
axis
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
For the below discussion we refer only to the first definition because
the second one shows comparable behavior with change in signs of some of
the parameters.

To explore the basic geometric principles behind the attractors
generated by this map we started with a set of 200 equally spaced
starting points ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
all of which lie on the circle ![x=\\cos(t),
y=\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
With each starting point the map was iterated 2000 times. Then the
evolution of each starting point under the map was plotted in one of 11
different colors. We were able to determine the following rules for the
structure of these attractors:

1\) The most important determinant of the geometry of the attractor is
sum of the parameters ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
When ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are closer to 1 and ![a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow
2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3+%5Crightarrow+2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
where
![p,q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Cq&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are mutually prime integers, we get a p-ad structure in the attractor
(e.g. Figure 1).

In Figure 1,
![a_1=a_4=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Da_4%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
takes successively, by row, the following 4 pairs of values (-0.5450419,
0.1); (-0.2450419; -0.2); (-0.7450419, 0.3); (-0.9450419; 0.5) . In each
case ![a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow

This determines the central heptad structure but the rest of the
attractor shows considerable variability that cannot be explained in a
straightforward way from these parameters.

then there is greater tolerance for the range of values ![a_1,

is relatively low.

the p-ad structure in the attractor tends to be retained (Figure 3).

thus, we get a core with a heptad structure.

square structure in the core of the attractor (Figure 4). This is
because ![a_2+a+3 \\rightarrow

we see a loss of the p-ad structure or a flattening of the attractor
along the axis of symmetry from the top left side (Figure 5).

and the expected pentad structure is retained. In the right panel
![a_1=a_4=0.1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Da_4%3D0.1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002);
we notice that the pentad structure has been lost with flattening along
the axis of symmetry.

These are the basic rules by which the core structure of the attractors
can be accounted for. The parameters ![a_1,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be seen as scaling parameters whereas ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
can be seen as rotational parameters. The latter pair sets up the
rotational structure based on how close their sum approaches
![2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
This is the cosine principle that occurs as the primary
structure-determinant in other chaotic maps, including maps which we
discovered and discussed before
([1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/the-geometric-principles-behind-discrete-dynamical-systems-based-on-the-generalized-witch-of-agnesi/),
[2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/03/25/the-remarkable-behavior-of-a-map-displaying-derived-from-a-simple-model-for-a-biological-conflict/)).
As in the previously discussed cases, this sets the limits of
![a_2+a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as (-2, 2); however, here there is greater scope for diversity because
the cosine principle is distributed over the sum of two separate
parameters. Beyond the cosine principle,n these attractors exhibit
additional features whose origins remain mysterious to us:

1\) For example, In Figure 3 in addition to the core heptad one can see
additional harmonics like a 11-ad, 18-ad and 29-ad structures. What is
the explanation for them? In the previous examples of chaotic maps we
could explain higher harmonics based on other
![\\tfrac{p}{q}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
whose
![\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
might lie close to the primary cosine. However, in this case the 11-ad,
the 18-ad and 29-ad correspond to no such cosines. Hence, their
emergence remains a mystery.

2\) Further, there is an effect of the starting ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which can result in the appearance of a n-ad structure independently of
the cosine principle (Figure 6).

In both the above cases the four parameters ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
are respectively, -0.567115129642189, -0.761931293738961,
-0.347582505706949, -0.069076271019876. However, the left panel was
initialized with a circle of radius 0.9 and the right panel was
initialized with a circle of radius
![\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
Only in the second case we see the emergence of a heptad structure,
which cannot be accounted for by the sum of ![a_2,
a_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).
The role of the starting ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in generating n-ad structures is another open question.

To further explore the diversity of chaotic attractors within the
above-stated parameter space for the 4 parameters of the map we set up
our code to search for such maps thus:  
1) We set ![x_0=0.3\\cos(\\pi/4), y_0=
0.3\\sin(\\pi/4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0.3%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2F4%29%2C+y_0%3D+0.3%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2F4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
as the starting point.  
2) We then randomly generated a set of parameters ![a_1, a_2, a_3,
a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in the range ![(-1.01,
1.01)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1.01%2C+1.01%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).  
3) For each such set we allowed ![(x_0,
y_0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2C+y_0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to evolve for 1000 iterations under the map. If the evolution resulted
in the divergence to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
or convergence to one or few point attractors, then we discarded those
parameters.  
4) A heuristic for chaos is that very small differences in the initial
conditions can result in very different end results upon evolution under
the map after a certain number of iterations. Hence, for those
parameters which survived the above filters we tested if a second ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),
which differed from the first by
![10^{-7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
in each coordinate diverged from the evolutionary path of the original
![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
after the same number of iterations. If it did so, the parameter set was
retained as it was the sign of being on a chaotic attractor.  
5) These surviving parameter sets were then explored more fully by
studying the evolution of 200 equally spaced points on the circle
![x=0.3\\cos(t),
y=0.3\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0.3%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D0.3%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
for 2000 iterations of the map.

We present below few examples of attractors emerging from the above
procedure with parameters listed in order from
![a_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
to
![a_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002).

This attractor assumes of the form reminiscent in some ways of the
gingerbread man seen in the classical Lozi attractor. The gingerbread
man has a “heart” in the form a five-lobed structure with a ellipse
within it.

This attractor has parallels to the previous one in being somewhat like
the gingerbread man with 4 hands.

This attractor takes the form of a fish or some crustacean naupilus
larva.

This is a representative of a prevalent type of attractor generated by
this map that may be termed the “Sombrero hat” type. The central heptad
structure in this attractor is a mystery because it is not explicable by
the cosine conditions above-presented .

This form of the attractor resembles the [butterfly
attractor](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/)
generated by the square-root modification of the Lozi map that we had
described earlier.

circle was changed from 0.3 to 1, though it is stable and similar at the
former value too. It vaguely resembles some Cambrian animal.

This attractor assumes a bun-shaped morph that is seen quite often under
these maps. An explanation for the multiple harmonics of this attractor
remains as yet mysterious to us.

Another Sombrero hat type form. The radius of the ![x_0,
y_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)
circle was changed from 0.3 to .4 for this attractor. How one accounts
for the central pentagonal zone of restriction and the triad of
octagonal restriction zones around it remains mysterious.

circle was changed from 0.3 to 0.31. It shows a central pentad
surrounded by 9 further pentads. An explanation for the emergence of
these pentads and the 9 fold harmonic however remains elusive.
