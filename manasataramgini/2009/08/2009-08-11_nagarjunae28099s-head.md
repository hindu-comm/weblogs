Remember nAgArjuna’s head. The prince wanted to cut off nAgArjuna’s head
and advanced with a sword. He thought that no one knew of his ways. But
when two men speak thinking they are alone rAjan varuNa hears as the
third. The mantravAdin said:  
*idam indra shR^iNuhi somapa yat tvA hR^idA shocatA johavImi \|  
vR^ishcAmi taM kulisheneva vR^ikShaM yo asmAkaM mana idaM hinasti
\|\|**  
* The bharadvAja has spoken, the foot of the striding viShNu is upon the
sadhyA’s head. May he stride widely and thunderously. urugAyo.adbhutaH
