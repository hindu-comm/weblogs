The tangled pantheon: Shinto, Indian, Cīna and Koreanic in the Japonic religion: a brief case study

While heavily influenced by the Sinitic transmissions, Japan retained its own unique traditions throughout the historical period. While the curtain of history lifts up late in Japan compared to the Middle Kingdom, the Japanese followed the latter’s tradition in terms of good record keeping. Thus, we have rather detailed material to reconstruct the history of the syncretism between the endogenous Shinto tradition and the Bauddha tradition, at least at some of the sacred sites. However, there are also downsides when trying to apprehend the evolution of East Asian religions. The general challenges of understanding the evolution of the Japanese religion are enormous for an outsider, even if he might have the vantage point of comparative analyses that might not be available to the common emic practitioner (c.f., a typical modern day śrauta ritualist). When a student pampered by the luxuries of studying the evolution of Indo-European religion approaches the Japanese religion, he is left flattened by the enormity of the questions. While one might sight some type of relationship – homology or analogy – to Koreanic or Sinitic religions, one is often left without a clue of its ancestral state. The contributions from the Jomon, the Northeast Asian Ainu-like peoples, and the Yayoi all seem too tangled like a Gordian knot. Further, beneath the Bauddha patina, dimly lit tropes peer forth – familiar yet too divergent to place in an evolutionary scheme. Thus, a man trying to understand the evolutionary history of the Japanese religion might feel rather bewildered. However, on some occasions, with some study, we can unravel the various strands of the puzzling tangle.

*Tenkeisei smashing and devouring epidemic demons (Heian period, 1100s of CE).*

As an example, we could consider the case of the Japanese “Raumya-s.” The Japanese tradition holds that the human body has 84000 pores/hair follicles, in each of which dwells a deity known as a zokushin. Among other things, these gods are said to control each “moment” of the 360 days of the old Japanese year. This “moment” would be approximately 6 minutes. This number, 84000, also corresponds to the deities known as the shikigami, who comprise the retinue of the Japanese deity Tenkeisei. The name Ten-kei-sei itself can be traced back to the Chinese Tiān Xíng Xīng thus:  
Tiān (天) = “heaven’’ or “god’’  
Xíng (刑) = “punishment’’  
Xīng (星) = “star’’  
“The Star of Heavenly Punishment”  
This indicates that Tenkeisei originated from an old Chinese astral deity who receded in the homeland but developed extensively in Japan. A part of this was the rise to prominence of him and his retinue as epidemic deities with rituals specifically directed at his capacity to consume disease demons “ekiki/ekki’’. Further, given Tenkeisei’s origin as a malevolent astral deity on the mainland, he was also viewed as a deity governing human fate, dispensing fortune or misfortune based on individuals’ actions. One of the epidemic demons that he is described as devouring or subduing is the buffalo-headed Gozu Tennō (to be discussed further below), which probably acted as a conduit for his absorption into the Bauddha tāntrika tradition. Here, he was unsurprisingly (given the associations of Gozu Tennō with King Yama and the buffalo/bull) associated with the deity Yamāntaka (Japanese: Daiitoku Myōō), who, in turn, in the Bauddha tradition, is seen as a manifestation or ectype of Mañjuśrī. Further, in some Japanese traditions, he came to be identified with Gozu Tennō himself. One example of this is the divinatory text Hoki Naiden, which the Japanese believe was transmitted from India via the Tang empire.

*Enthroned Gozu Tennō (Yoshino Maṇḍala, Edo period).*

Gozu Tennō has more mysterious roots and appears recognizably in the Japanese religion around the 700s of CE. In terms of iconography, he might have a bull/buffalo head (along with an anthropomorphic head) or multiple (originally 5; sometimes 11) heads. He is associated with a distinct mythology that places him in conflict with the Śākyamuni Buddha – he is even supposed to have killed the Buddha in an encounter by sending a disease to afflict the latter. Like Tenkeisei, he is also said to have a retinue of of 84654 deities associated with control of time and pestilence. Faure provides the below outline of his mythology with 6 elements \[Footnote 1\]:  
1. The birth and characteristic appearance of Gozu Tennō with multiple faces or a buffalo face of red hue and bearing white fangs.  
2. He goes south to obtain a wife.  
3. He is refused lodging by the wealthy Bauddha householder Kotan when he seeks a dwelling.  
4. He is offered shelter by Somin Shōrai the poor brother of Kotan.  
5. He marries Harisaijo, the daughter of the dragon king, and through her fathers 8 children known as the princes. Some traditions also mention them having a daughter, the snake-goddess, known as Jadokkeshin (a deity with parallels to the Hindu goddess Mānasā).  
6. While returning, Gozu Tennō destroys Kotan’s house or kills him after giving Somin Shōrai’s daughter an amulet of miscanthus reeds or willow wood to protect her and Somin Shōrai’s descendants.

Finally, Gozu Tennō is also identified in some traditions with the Shinto stormy deity Susanoo. This suggests a complex history for the deity. The spread of the Gozu Tennō cult from the West and its appearance around the 700s suggests a possible Koreanic transmission to Japan. This is supported by the similarities between the Korean deity Ch’ŏyong and Gozu Tennō; however, there is not much survival of the cult of this deity on the Korean side. This was followed by the syncretism of Gozu Tennō with the old Shinto Haya Susanoo, the younger brother of Amaterasu. Shortly thereafter, or around the same time, there was a potential antagonistic encounter with the spreading Saugata religion. This is indicated by the failure of Kotan’s bauddha rituals performed by 1000 śramaṇa-s sent by the Buddha himself to protect him from Gozu Tennō’s attack. Finally, this was followed by reconciliation with the bauddha-s and further syncretism via a merger with Tenkeisei, the Japanese evolute of the Chinese astral deity Tiān Xíng Xīng. Following reconciliation with the Saugata-mata, he is called a Buddha himself (a manifestation of the cosmic Buddha Mahāvairocana), and in his 11-faced iconography, one of the faces is a pacific Buddha face. In some narrations, his syncretism with Tenkeisei is presented as happening in India: here, Tenkeisei incarnated as Gozu Tennō, the king of Magadha. In this cycle, a bird informs Gozu Tennō of the daughter of the Nāgarāja (dragon king) – a motif going back to the śruti, where, in the Sāmaveda-brāhmaṇa-s, Garuḍa takes the Vāsiṣṭha, Gaurivīti Śāktya, to his lover in the rakṣas’ realm. In other accounts, he is described as being born on the slopes of Meru. As part of the reconciliation with the Bauddha-mata, Gozu Tennō instructs his entourage of 84000-odd deities not to harm Somin Shōrai’s descendants unless they discard the Buddha-s and the gods.

Among the textual sources for the worship of this deity, the Gozu tennō kōshiki transmitted at a subcomplex of the Tsushima shrine is of great interest. It offers the following curious myth: Gozu Tennō first manifested as a king named Mutō Tennō in a kingdom of northern India along with his eight sons and 84654 attendant deities. They became the protectors of the Jetavana-vihāra in India. Here, Kotan and Somin Shōrai are presented as Indians, and the event happened in a former kalpa. After 75,580,000 years, Gozu Tennō reincarnated in China as Emperor Shennong around 2800 BCE (in the current kalpa) and discovered tea (chai). Then, at the time of Kōrei Tennō (290-215 BCE), he crossed the sea to reach Japan, where he stayed in the West in the Taichō province for 780 years. Then, in the first year of the reign of Kinmei Tennō (539 CE), he moved to the Tsushima Island. The text also offers a myth where the deity Gozu Tennō appeared as an old man before the great goddess Amaterasu standing on a reed. This reed is said to have become the islands of Japan. His amulets representing those given to Somin Shōrai are found in both Japan and Korea, and Somin Shōrai himself is worshipped by some Korean clans. He had major cultic centers at Hiromine, Gion, Tsushima and Ise.

Yamāntaka masterpiece (late 1200s of CE around the time of the Mongol invasions)

Returning to Tenkeisei, we find that his spread throughout Japan (as indicated by amulets) parallels that of Gozu Tennō with whom he came to be identified. However, as noted above, he is shown subjugating or devouring Gozu Tennō. This suggests that just as the Bauddha-s had an antagonistic interaction with Gozu Tennō, the Chinese-origin Tenkeisei cult also likely had a clash with that of Gozu Tennō as their domains closely overlapped. However, this was resolved in two ways – either by making Tenkeisei overcome Gozu Tennō, now painted as a demon of pestilence or by syncretizing the two by virtue of their natural similarities. We find that the cult of Tenkeisei was associated with several secret rituals transmitted via texts paralleling the Bauddha tantra-s that were transmitted to Japan. Faure points to two of these Tenkeisei gyōhō and the Tenkeisei gyōhō shidai as teaching secret āveśa rituals. This is particularly interesting because of the Bauddha identification of Tenkeisei with Yamāntaka. Parallel to this, Gozu Tennō is identified with King Yama in some Japanese traditions, according to Faure. While Yamāntaka is seen as an emanation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, he is essentially a Bauddha absorption of the Hindu Rudra, even retaining his epithet as is. Not surprisingly, his iconography parallels that of Rudra with a bull mount. Interestingly, the Japanese mythic history holds that before her invasion of Korea, the source of epidemics, the Japanese Empress Jingū saw the manifestation of a divine bull/ox, which was believed to be a sign of the god Yamāntaka.

Āveśa rituals were an old feature of the śaiva tradition and were retained in the Bhairavasrotas as a notable practice. A śaiva āveśa text was translated into Chinese by Amoghavajra in the 700s of CE, titled Suji liyan Moxishouluo tian shuo (jialouluo) aweishe fa: The (Garuḍa) āveśa rite explained by the god Maheśvara which swiftly establishes its efficacy. This text was transmitted to Japan by Kūkai in 806 CE. It is likely a śaiva Garuḍa-srotas text and is presented as a teaching of Rudra to Viṣṇu. It presents a rite of using young kids as spirit mediums via āveśa.

Both Tenkeisei and Gozu Tennō possess several features indicative of a “Rudrian” character: 1. The lord of pestilence (Gozu Tennō); 2. The punishing star Tenkeisei; c.f., the astral myth of Rudra (Ārdra, Iranic Tishtrya) punishing Prajāpati; 3. The bull/buffalo association. 4. The emanation of 84000 odd attendant deities (c.f., gaṇa-s). Further, their association with the roma-kūpa-s (hair-pits) reminds one of the Raumya-s – gaṇa-s emanated by Rudra/Vīrabhadra from the roma-kūpa-s (e.g., Śantiparvan 284 of Mahābhārata-vulgate). The Raumya-s are invoked in a secret ritual relating to the mantra known as the Vīrabhadrāstra. Thus, given that a śaiva āveśa text had reached China and Japan by the 700s-800s of CE, it is likely that such material served as a nexus for interactions between the endogenous rites related to deities with a Rudrian character like Tenkeisei and Gozu Tennō and their absorption into Yamāntaka. We posit that this facilitated the incorporation of āveśa in the rites of Tenkeisei. The association of Rudrian deities with epidemics in Japan is also indicated by the Matarajin rite, which is centered on the Mātṛ-s transmitted via the Bauddha-s (derogatorily called rākṣasī-s in early Tāthāgata tradition) to Japan.

Another key connection indicative of an Indian transmission is the connection between the hair follicles and the moments of time. This is a concept going back to the Brāhmaṇa-s of the Śruti. For instance, we have the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa of the Śuklayajurveda state a teaching of Vārkali thus:  
daśa ca vai sahasrāṇy aṣṭau ca śatāni saṃvatsarasya muhūrtāḥ। yāvanto muhūrtās tāvanti pañcadaśa-kṛtvaḥ kṣiprāṇi। yāvanti kṣiprāṇi tāvanti pañcadaśa-kṛtva etarhīṇi। yāvanty etarhīṇi tāvanti pañcadaśa-kṛtva idānīni। yāvanti+idānīni tāvantaḥ pañcadaśa-kṛtvaḥ prāṇāḥ। yāvantaḥ prāṇās tāvanto .aktanāḥ। yāvanto .aktanās tāvanto nimeṣāḥ। yāvanto nimeṣās tāvanto lomagartāḥ। yāvanto lomagartās tāvanti svedāyanāni। yāvanti svedāyanāni tāvanta ete stokā varṣanti॥ SB 12.3.2.5॥

10800 (360 ![\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) 30) are the muhurta-s (=48 minutes) in a year. As many muhurta-s exist, so there are 15 times that number of kṣipra-s (quick intervals= 3.2 minutes). As many quick breaths, so there are 15 times that number of etarhi-s (=12.8s). As many etarhi-s, so there are 15 times that number of idāni-s (=0.8533…s). As many idāni-s, so there are 15 times that number of prāṇa-s (in-breaths). As many prāṇa-s, so are the number of aktana-s (out-breaths). As many aktana-s, so are the number of nimēṣa-s (0.056888…s). As many nimēṣa-s, so are the number of hair pores. As many hair pores, so are the number of sweat glands. As many sweat glands, so are the number of \[drops\] that rain down in \[an year\].

A parallel passage, albeit with inflated numbers, is found in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa of the Atharvaveda:  
daśa ca ha vai sahasrāṇy aṣṭau ca śatāni saṃvatsarasya muhūrtā iti । etāvanta eva puruṣasya peśaśamarā iti । atra tat samam । yāvanto muhūrtāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvantaḥ prāṇāḥ । yāvantaḥ prāṇāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvanto .apānāḥ । yāvanto .apānāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvanto vyānāḥ । yāvanto vyānāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvantaḥ samānāḥ । yāvantaḥ samānāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvanta udānāḥ । yāvanta udānāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvanty etādīni । yāvanty etādīni tāvanty etarhīṇi । yāvanty etarhīṇi tāvanti svedāyanāni । yāvanti svedāyanāni tāvanti kṣiprāyaṇāni । yāvanti kṣiprāyaṇāni tāvanto romakūpāḥ। yāvanto romakūpāḥ pañcadaśa kṛtvas tāvanto varṣato dhārās । tad etat krośaśatikaṃ parimāṇam ॥ GB 1.5.5

10800 are the muhurta-s in a year. These are equivalent to the \[number of\] interstitial spaces in the flesh (peśa-śamarāḥ) in a person. In this, they are equivalent. As many muhūrtas as there are, fifteen times that number are the prāṇa-s (breaths). As many prāṇa-s, fifteen times that number are the apāna-s (excretory processes). As many apāna-s, fifteen times that number are the vyāna-s (circulatory movements). As many vyāna-s, fifteen times that number are the samāna-s (assimilative functions). As many assimilative functions, fifteen times that number are the udāna-s (nervous processes). As many udāna-s, fifteen times that number are etādi-s. As many etādi-s, so many are the etarhi-s. As many etarhi-s, so many are the sweat glands. As many sweat glands, so many are the quick movements (kṣiprāyaṇa-s). As many quick movements, so many are the hair follicles. As many hair follicles, fifteen times that number are the drops that fall as rain. This is the measure equivalent to a hundred krośa-s.

These numbers, 546,750,000 in the SB and 123,018,750,000 in the GB are much higher than the 84000 seen in the Japanese tradition. However, the number 84000 seems to be favored by the bauddha-s and appears in several contexts as a count for different things in their texts (importantly, the 84000 doors to nirvāṇa already seen in the vulgar Pāḷī). Thus, a merger of the substratum H tradition regarding roma-kūpa-s and the fierce Raumya gaṇa-s born of Rudra’s hair follicles with distinct deities of Sinitic and Koreanic origins gave rise to the Japanese tradition regarding Tenkeisei-Gozu Tennō. While there is a natural inclination to associate Tiān Xíng Xīng with the planet Saturn, his murky past raises the possibility that he was an early transmission of an Indo-Iranian Rudrian astral deity (c.f., Ārdra/Tishtrya) from a steppe Indo-Iranian group to the north. While we have transmission of the Rudrian iconography for Ārdra in the later Hindu astral tradition to China, we currently lack the data to test the conjecture of an earlier influence.
