The sixteen-fold Puruṣa

## Puruṣa mytheme
The Puruṣa-sūkta, or the chant of Puruṣa-Nārāyaṇa,  
is a late Vedic composition with multiple variants  
that occupies a focal position in the history of the Indo-Aryan strand of the Indo-European religion.  
On one side, it features an ancient motif of cosmogony  
by sacrifice/dismemberment of a cosmic humanoid figure (the Puruṣa)  
that goes back to at least the Post-Yamnayan IE assemblage:  
it is attested as the myth of Ymir among the (North) Germanics,  
that of Gayō Maretan among the Iranians,  
and that of the Puruṣa among the Hindus.  
A version of this myth was evidently transmitted by an eastern branch of the Indo-Iranians to what became China  
as the myth of Pan-Gu (who is still worshiped by some modern Chinese/Taiwanese).  

With regard to the presence of this myth in Yamnayan IE,  
one could point to faint echoes of the myth in the Greek tradition.  
The well-known version is seen in the form of the cosmogonic dis-“member”-ment of Ouranos by Kronos.  
A lesser-known reflex of this myth occurs in the form of the dismemberment of Dionysus in the Rhapsodic Theogony,  
whose cosmogonic significance is laid out by one of the last of the classical Platonists, the younger Olympiodorus.  
Thus, the Puruṣa mytheme could potentially have a much deeper provenance  
(c.f., the origin myth of the Austronesian Ceram tribe from Indonesia involving the dismemberment of the cosmogonic girl).  

On another side, the Puruṣa-sūkta is featured as the central incantation in the reenactment of this primordial sacrifice in the Indo-Aryan ritual of the human sacrifice (Puruṣamedha), which had already become otiose and “domesticated” (using the logic that cannibalism is proscribed) by the time of the classical Śrauta ritual.

## Viṣṇu association
A further aspect of this sūkta is the tacit connection of the Puruṣa with Viṣṇu, [a god with deep IE roots](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/02/the-roots-of-vai%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87avam-a-view-from-the-numerology-of-vedic-texts/) and a prominent presence in the post-Yamnayan IE traditions (Germanic: Víðarr, (aspects of) Celtic: Taranis, Iranic: Rasnu and Indian: Viṣṇu; also note Varāha-like aspects of Chinese Pan-Gu). This is expressed by the parallel between the three world-encompassing strides of Viṣṇu and the same of the Puruṣa: tato viṣvaṅ vy akrāmat sāśanānaśane abhi ॥ RV 10.90.4 (Therefrom, he strode forth into everything, into those that eat (living beings) and those that do not). 

Before this statement, the Puruṣa is described with the term tripāt, which is a double entendre implying both three-fourths and three steps.+++(5)+++  
This connection suggests that the sūkta was evidently composed during the rise of Viṣṇu along with the spread of the ādhvaryava tradition. Notably, this went hand-in-hand with Viṣṇu’s identification with the yajña (sacrifice), which is also the case with the Puruṣa:  

> E.g., agninā vai devatayā viṣṇunā yajñena devā asurān pravlīya vajreṇānv avāsṛjan । Maitrāyaṇīya saṃhitā 1.6.6.5 
> 
> (Verily, with Agni as the deity, \[and\] Viṣṇu as the sacrifice, the gods pressed against the demons and with the vajra drove them away one after another.)  

> C.f., taṃ yajñaṃ prāvṛṣā praukṣan puruṣaṃ jātam agraśaḥ । tena devā ayajanta sādhyā vasavaś ca ye ॥ AV-vulgate 19.6.11 
> 
> (That sacrifice, they sprinkled with \[purifying\] rains, the first-born Puruṣa. With him the gods, the Sādhya-s, and the Vasu-s performed the sacrifice).

The connection to Viṣṇu was to have a bright future,  
making the Puruṣa-sūkta a major litany for Viṣṇu in the Vidhāna and post-Vedic tradition.  

## Nārāyaṇa
A further aspect of this development was related to the legendary promulgator of the Puruṣamedha ritual, Nārāyaṇa:

> puruṣo ha nārāyaṇo. akāmayata atitiṣṭheyaṃ sarvāṇi bhūtāny aham evedaṃ sarvaṃ syām iti । sa etam puruṣamedham pañcarātram yajña-kratum apaśyat । tam āharat tenāyajata teneṣṭvāty atiṣṭhat sarvāṇi bhūtānīdaṃ । sarvam abhavad । atitiṣṭhati sarvāṇi bhūtānīdaṃ sarvam bhavati ya evam vidvān puruṣamedhena yajate yo vai tad evam veda ॥SB 13.6.1.21  
>
> Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa desired thus:“I should surpass all beings! I alone should be everything here (this universe)!” He saw this five-night ritual performance, the Puruṣamedha; he took it and sacrificed with it. Having sacrificed with it, he surpassed all beings. He became everything here. Verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Puruṣamedha, or even who knows this, surpasses all beings and becomes everything here.

> tasya trayoviṃśatir dīkṣāḥ dvādaśopasadaḥ pañca sutyāḥ । sa eṣa catvāriṃśad rātraḥ sadīkṣopasat kaś catvāriṃśad akṣarā virāṭ tad virājam abhisampadyate “tato virāḍ ajāyata virājo adhi pūruṣa” ity eṣā vai sā virāḍ etasyā evaitad virājo yajñam puruṣaṃ janayati ॥ SB 13.6.1.22
>
> Its (the Puruṣamedha’s) consecrations are twenty-three; it has twelve Upasad-s and five \[Soma\]-pressings. Thus, this being a ritual \[of a total of\] forty nights, including Dīkshā-s and Upasads, maps to a Virāj, for the Virāj consists of forty syllables. \[Hence, it is recited that\]: “Thence the Virāj was born and from the Virāj, the Pūrusha.” This, then, is that Virāj, and from out of that Virāj \[the ritualist\] generates the Puruṣa, the sacrifice.

This Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa, who surpassed and became everything in the universe, came to be identified as a name of Viṣṇu. This process began suggestively in the late Yajurveda tradition with an addendum known as the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa to the Puruṣa-Nārāyaṇa chant, i.e., the core Puruṣa-sūkta (along with the corresponding Uttara-Nārāyaṇa śrauta ritual that follows the Puruṣamedha). Here, the Puruṣa is described as having Hrī and Śrī as his wives. The identification of Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa with Viṣṇu was further developed within the early Vaiṣṇava tradition of Pañcarātra as expounded in the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Mahābhārata. Notably, the name of this tradition, Pañcarātra, directly stems from the description of the Puruṣamedha as the rite with five nights of Soma pressings. The Pañcarātra tradition affiliates itself with the [Śukla-Yajurveda](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/tritonal-recitations-of-vaishnava-s/) (SKY), where the Pañcarātra Puruṣamedha likely originated. The argument for the origin of the Pañcarātra Puruṣamedha in the SKY tradition goes thus: the full account of the Pañcarātra rite performed by Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa is only found in the Śatapatha brāhmaṇa (SB). Correspondingly, the Puruṣa-sūkta is embedded right within the Saṃhitā-s of the SYV (Mādhyaṃdina and Kāṇva). In contrast, the Puruṣa-sūkta is not found in all collections of the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda (KYV). In the Taittirīya tradition, it is only found in the late collection of that tradition, i.e., the Āraṇyaka (TA). In the Kaṭha tradition, it is found in a supplementary Ṛk-saṃhitā used by the Kaṭha-s to supply those mantra-s not found within their core Saṃhitā (or lost Brāhmaṇa texts). Thus, as the popularity of the Pañcarātra Puruṣamedha grew, it appears to have spread laterally across the ādhvaryava tradition. Hence, the case may be made that of the two strands of the early Vaiṣṇava tradition emerging from the ādhvaryava matrix, Pañcarātra emerged among the SYVs and Vaikhānasa among the KYVs (who also adopted the Puruṣa-sūkta for their ritual).

The name Nārāyaṇa is etymologized in later tradition (e.g., Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa and Manu-smṛti) on the basis of his emergence from the waters (“nara-s”) and the generation of Hiraṇyagarbha in these primordial waters. This immediately indicates that Nārāyaṇa as the Puruṣa was probably originally conceived within the framework of a Prājāpatya myth seen in the SB, where Prajāpati is identified with the Puruṣa emerging from the waters:

> āpo ha vā idam agre salilam evāsa । tā akāmayanta kathaṃ nu prajāyemahīti । tā aśrāmyaṃs tās tapo’tapyanta tāsu tapas tapyamānāsu hiraṇmayam āṇḍaṃ sambabhūva+ajāto ha tarhi saṃvatsara āsa । tad idaṃ hiraṇmayam āṇḍaṃ yāvat saṃvatsarasya velā tāvat paryaplavata ॥ SB 11.1.6.1
>
> Verily, in the beginning of this (universe) were the waters, only an ocean. They \[the waters\] desired, “Now, how can we be reproduced?” They strove hard and performed tapas. By that tapas, they, becoming heated, produced a golden egg. The year, indeed, was then not in existence; this golden egg floated about for as long as the duration of a year.

> tataḥ saṃvatsare puruṣaḥ samabhavat । sa prajāpatis tasmād u saṃvatsara eva strī vā gaur vā vaḍabā vā vijāyate । saṃvatsare hi prajāpatir ajāyata sa idaṃ hiraṇmayam āṇḍaṃ vyarujann āha tarhi kā cana pratiṣṭhāsa । tad enam idam eva hiraṇmayam āṇḍaṃ yāvat saṃvatsarasya velāsīt tāvad bibhrat paryaplavata ॥ SB 11.1.6.2
>
> In a year’s time, the Puruṣa came into being therefrom. He was Prajāpati. Hence, a woman, a cow, or a mare gives birth within a year. Prajāpati, indeed, was born in a year and broke open this golden egg. Then, indeed, there was no resting place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for the duration of a year.

Thus, we have: Waters ![\\to](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) Golden Egg ![\\to](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) Puruṣa Prajāpati. This would make the Puruṣa to be Nārāyaṇa with respect to the waters (Nara-s) supporting the original Prājāpatya origin of this myth.

## Yajña
Finally, there is a less-appreciated connection between the Puruṣa-sūkta and the Yajña encoded in its structure itself.  
This is acknowledged in texts of both the SYV and KYV traditions  
but is fully developed only in the SYV,  
again supporting the expansion of the Puruṣa-centric theology within the SYV.  

### 16 verse form
While versions of the Puruṣa-sūkta are found across all Vedic Saṃhitā-s,  
they are notable for their divergence from each other  
despite being a late composition.  
Despite this divergence, the versions in the RV, AV-vulgate, AV-P, SYV saṃhitā-s and Kaṭha-ṛk-saṃhitā-s have 16 verses (15 anuṣṭubh-s+ a final triṣṭubh in the RV version).  
The version in the Sāmaveda saṃhitā-s is shortened,  
keeping with the way the ṛk-s are chosen for gānā composition.  

The version in the KYV Taittrīya āraṇyaka has an insert after verse 15 containing two triṣṭubh-s (the second being hypermetrical),  
extending it to an 18 verse form.  
These two triṣṭubh-s appear to be a clear secondary duplication and transposition from the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa that follows. 

Thus, its conserved core remains a 16-verse composition as in the other non-SV saṃhitā-s. This indicates that the number 16 was a critical feature of the Puruṣa-sūkta. Hence, it is notable that the brāhmaṇa tradition describes the Puruṣa as 16-fold. The Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa states in the section pertaining to the Rājasūya ritual:  

> ṣoḍaśabhir gṛhṇāti । ṣoḍaśa-kalo vai puruṣaḥ । yāvān eva puruṣaḥ । tasmin vīryaṃ dadhāti । ṣoḍaśabhir juhoti ṣoḍaśabhir gṛhṇāti । dvātri̐śat saṃpadyante । dvātri̐śadakṣarā+anuṣṭuk । vāg anuṣṭup sarvāṇi cchandā̐si । vācā+evaina̐ sarvebhiś chandobhir abhiṣiñcati ॥ 

in TB 1.7.5.5 (also see parallel text in the Brāhmaṇa from the Kaṭha Saṃhitā 21.8.2, which is, however, presented in the context of the sin-effacing Vaiśvakarma oblations).

> With sixteen, he takes hold. The Puruṣa indeed has sixteen parts. However much the Puruṣa is, in that he places the essence. With sixteen, he sacrifices \[and\] with sixteen, he takes hold. \[Hence,\] thirty-two are put together. The anuṣṭubh meter is of thirty-two syllables. Speech (Vāk) is anuṣṭubh, \[encompassing\] all meters. With speech, verily, he consecrates \[him\] with all meters.

Thus, the 16-fold nature of the Puruṣa directly related to both the sacrifice and the 32-syllabled anuṣṭubh (16 ![\\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) 2), which respectively also map onto the number verses in the Puruṣa-sūkta and the primary meter in which it is composed.

### Oblation homologies
In the same section describing the origin of the Puruṣa Prajāpati from the waters and the Golden Egg (see above),  
the SB elaborates on this 16-fold connection, providing a mapping of the homologies of the anatomy of the Puruṣa and the ritual:

> athādhyātmam ।  
> pañceme puruṣe prāṇā ṛte cakṣurbhyāṃ ।  
> ta eva pañca prayājā cakṣuṣī ājyabhāgau ॥  
> 
> Now, as to one’s own self (body): In the Puruṣa, there are these five prāṇa-s (physiological processes) excluding the eyes. These are the five prayāja-s (fore-offerings); the two ājyabhāga-s (ghee-offerings) are the eyes.

> ayam evāvāṅ prāṇaḥ sviṣṭakṛt । sa yat tam abhy ardha ivetarābhya āhutibhyo juhoti tasmād etasmāt prāṇāt sarve prāṇā bībhatsante .atha yat sviṣṭakṛte sarveṣāṃ haviṣām avadyati tasmād yat kiṃ cemān prāṇān āpadyata etam eva tat sarvaṃ samavaiti ॥  
> 
> The sviṣṭakṛt is the excretory (downward) process (prāṇa).+++(5)+++  
> Because he offers that (sviṣṭakṛt), as though,  
> separately from the other oblations,  
> therefore all the \[other\] prāṇa-s stay away (literally: are scared by) from that prāṇa.  
> Now, because for the sviṣṭakṛt  
> he cuts portions from all the offering,  
> therefore everything that passes through these processes (prāṇa) meets in that process (prāṇa)  
> (An account of excretory physiology and its homology with the expiatory sviṣṭakṛt oblation).+++(5)+++

> trīṇi śiśnāni ta eva trayo .anuyājāḥ । sa yo .ayaṃ varṣiṣṭho .anuyājas tad idaṃ varṣiṣṭham iva śiśnaṃ taṃ vā anavān anyajed ity āhus tatho hāsyaitad amṛdhram bhavatīti ॥
>   
> The three anuyāja-s (after-offerings) are the three genitalia. That which is the main after-offering is like the central genital. “He should offer it without taking an in-breath,” they (the rival teachers of the Vājasaneyin-s) say, “because it thus becomes unfaltering for him.”

> sa vai sakṛd avānyāt ekaṃ hy etasya parvātha yad aparvakaṃ syāt pratṛṇaṃ vaiva tiṣṭhel lambeta vā tasmād etad ucca tiṣṭati padyate ca tasmāt sakṛd avānyāt ॥
>   
> However, he should indeed take a breath once (before making the anuyāja oblations) because it (the central genital) has one articulation; if it were unarticulated, it would either just stand erect or would just dangle down. Because it both stands erect and falls (flaccid), he may therefore inhale once.

> dvau bāhū dvā ūrū ta eva catvāraḥ patnīsaṃyājāḥ pratiṣṭhāyam eva । prāṇa iḍā yat tāṃ nāgnau juhoti yat sāpradagdheva tasmād ayam anavatṛṇaḥ prāṇaḥ ॥  
> 
> The two arms and the two thighs are the four Patnīsaṃyāja-s: verily the support. \[The undivided/central\] Prāṇa is the Iḍā offering. As that (Iḍā) is not offered in the fire but remains unburnt, therefore this prāṇaḥ is undivided (Foreshadowing the role of the spinal cord in the later tāntrika traditions).+++(5)+++

> asthy eva yājyānuvākyāḥ । māṃsaṃ havis । tan mitaṃ chando yad yājyānuvākyās tasmād u samāvanty evāsthīni medyataś ca kṛśyataś ca bhavanty atha yad bhūya iva ca havir gṛhṇāti । kanīya iva ca tasmād u māṃsāny eva medyato medyanti māṃsāni kṛśyataḥ kṛśyanti । tenaitena yajñena yāṃ kāmayate devatāṃ tāṃ yajati yasyai havir bhavati ॥  
> 
> The bones are the yājya incantations. The flesh is the offering material. As the yājya incantations are measured by meters, therefore the bones remain constant \[be they\] of a fat and a thin person. However, even as he takes more \[or less\], offering material, the flesh of a fat person fattens, and the flesh of a thin person thins. Thus, he performs this sacrifice to any deity he desires \[and\] for whom there is a sacrificial offering.

> tā vā etā anapoddhāryā āhutayo bhavanti । sa yad dhaitāsām apoddhared yathaikam aṅgaṃ śṛṇīyāt prāṇaṃ vā nirhaṇyād evaṃ । tad anyānyeva havīṃṣy upa cāhriyante .apa ca hriyante ॥  
> 
> These are the offerings not to be omitted. If one were to omit any of them, it would be as if he may cut off some organ or may remove some metabolic process. Then, the other oblations, indeed, are either added to or omitted.

> tā vā etāḥ ṣoḍaśāhutayo bhavanti ṣoḍaśa-kalo vai puruṣaḥ । puruṣo yajñas tasmāt ṣoḍaśāhutayo bhavanti ॥SB 11.1.6.29-36  
>
> These, indeed, are the sixteen offerings, for the Puruṣa consists of sixteen parts. The sacrifice is the Puruṣa; therefore, there are sixteen offerings.

[TABLE]

Hence, in conclusion, we posit that the 16-fold structure of the Puruṣa-sūkta was intended to reflect homology between the anatomy of the Puruṣa and the structure of the ritual right from the time of its composition, or in the least, this connection was established early in its deployment. Even though the above SB section indicates that it emerged in a Prājāpatya context, the establishment of an intimate homology between the ritual and the Puruṣa helped cement his identity with Viṣṇu, given the latter’s identification with the yajña in the developing śrauta tradition. This also probably provided the foundation for other related homologies, such as that of the sacrificial boar (Yajña-varāha; also identified with Viṣṇu) and the ritual, which originated in the Kaṭha tradition.
