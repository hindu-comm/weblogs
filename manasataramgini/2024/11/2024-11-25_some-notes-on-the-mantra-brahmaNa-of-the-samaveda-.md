Some notes on the Mantra-brāhmaṇa of the Sāmaveda with a focus on Virūpākṣa Dantāñji, an ectype of Rudra

Of the Sāmavedic schools, the Kauthuma-s follow the śrautasūtra of Lāṭyāyana and the gṛhyasūtra of Gobhila. The Rāṇāyanīya-s follow the śrautasūtra of Drāhyāyaṇa and the gṛhyasūtra of Khādira (also attributed to Drāhyāyaṇa). Their respective śrautasūtra-s are dependent on closely related collections of gāna-s composed on the ṛk-s from a Saṃhitā that is usually termed the Kauthuma-saṃhitā and the specifications of the Pañcaviṃśa-brāhmaṇa. Their respective gṛhyasūtra-s are dependent on mantra-s drawn from the Chāndogya-brāhmaṇa. The Kauthuma-s and Rāṇāyanīya-s are clearly closely related schools as their gāna collections and saṃhitā-s are very similar or the same. This is also reflected in their gṛhyasūtra-s being very close. The Jaiminīya school is more divergent and is marked by a distinct eponymous saṃhitā, gāna-s and a sprawling brāhmaṇa. These inform their śrautasūtra, the Jaiminīya-śrautasūtra. Their gṛhyasūtra, the Jaimini-gṛhyasūtra is more divergent than Gobhila and Khādira. However, of the two, it is closer to Gobhila, suggesting that these two preserve more of the ancestral state of the gṛhyasūtra of the Sāmavedin-s. Notably, the Jaimini-gṛhyasūtra provides several of the mantra-s found in the Chāndogya-brāhmaṇa in full within the body of the text. Hence, it is conceivable that the Jaiminīya-s did not have cognate of the Chāndogya-brāhmaṇa (although they might have possessed an equivalent Mantrapāṭḥa, rumored to exist among Jaiminīya-s of the Drāviḍa country). Further, the Jaimini-gṛhyasūtra shows close parallels to the Baudhāyana-gṛhyasūtra-s and gṛhya-pariśiṣṭha-s.

The Chāndogya-brāhmaṇa or Chāndogya-upaniṣad-brāhmaṇa is text in 10 prapāṭhaka-s of which 1-2 form the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, and the remaining 3-10 form the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. The former comes with two medieval glosses attributed to the scholiasts Sāyaṇa, the Vijayanagaran prime minister, and Bhaṭṭa Guṇaviṣṇu. The below discussion will focus on the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, which has homologous elements in the Jaimini-gṛhyasūtra. The main dilation in this note would be on the deity Virūpākṣa Dantāñji who is worshiped in the Agnihotra or daily gṛhya fire offering of the Sāmavedin-s and related Rudrian deities. Briefly, the contents of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa go thus:  
1.1. The preliminary fire ritual of marriage to various deities. Here Tvāṣṭṛ is described as three-horned (triśṛṅga).  
1.2. The marriage rite. This khaṇḍa contains the incantations of the famous ritual of seven steps. In several rituals, the ritualist impersonates the famed steps of Viṣṇu. The seven steps taken in the Indo-Aryan marriage rite can be seen as one such. The incantations accompanying it go thus in the Sāmavedic tradition:  
ekam iṣe viṣṇus tvā nayatu \| dve ūrje viṣṇus tvā nayatu \| trīṇi vratāya viṣṇus tvā nayatu \| catvāri māyobhavāya viṣṇus tvā nayatu \|
pañca paśubhyo viṣṇus tvā nayatu \| ṣaḍ rāyas poṣāya viṣṇus tvā nayatu \| sapta saptabhyo hotrābhyo viṣṇus tvā nayatu \|  
The first step for food, may Viṣṇu lead you; the second step for strength, may Viṣṇu lead you; the third step for the observance, may Viṣṇu lead you; the fourth step for enjoyment, may Viṣṇu lead you; the fifth step for cattle, may Viṣṇu lead you; the sixth step for the increase of wealth, may Viṣṇu lead you; the seventh step for the seven-fold hotṛ-hood, may Viṣṇu lead you;

sakhā saptapadī bhava sakhyaṃ te gameyam̐ sakhyāt te mā yoṣam̐ sakhyān me mā yoṣṭhāḥ \|\|  
With the seventh step, be my friend. May I attain companionship with you. May I not be separated from your companionship. May you not break your friendship with me.

1.3. Ritual done after the core marriage rite.  
1.4 Ritual done by the bride on the 4th day after marriage and the rite for progeny.  
1.5 Perinatal rites such as Sīmantonnayana, Medhājananam and Nāmakaraṇa.  
1.6 Tonsure. Upanayana.  
1.7 Sacrifice to various deities for protection.  
1.8 Sacrifice for the protection of cattle. Invocation of Bhava and Indra.

2.1 Sacrifice to the king of the snakes (Sarpa-rāja) and related pacificatory offerings (c.f., [installation of the snake idol in the later Sāmavedic Gautama-gṛhya-pariśiṣṭa ritual attributed to Bhāguri](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/12/27/origins-of-the-serpent-cult-and-bhaguris-snake-installation-from-the-samaveda-tradition/)).  
2.2 Animal sacrifice, protection of cattle and protection at night.  
2.3 Śrāddha and ancestor spirit rituals.  
2.4 Worship performed at Agnihotra or the Gṛhya-ritual fire rituals and various incantations for kāmya homa-s.  
2.5 Ritual to counter snakes and parasites; a ritual for glory; a ritual to the sun-boat.  
2.6 Ritual for increased prosperity, countering poisons and imprecatory incantations  
2.7 Incantations against parasitic worms and flies. In these incantations attributed to Jamadagni, Atri, Gotama and Bharadvāja, we find the first knowledge of the agents of myiasis:  
kṛmim indrasya bāhubhyām avāñcaṃ pātayāmasi \| hatāḥ kṛmayaḥ sāśātikāḥ sa-nīlamakṣikāḥ \|\|  
We hurl down the worm with the arms of Indra. Slain are the worms with the cattle bots (Āśātika-s) and the blue bottle flies (Nīlamakṣika-s).

Āśātika-s are also mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka:  
āśātikāḥ krimaya iva । tataḥ pūyante vāsavaiḥ । apaitaṃ mṛtyuṃ jayati ।  
The Āśātika-s are like worms, i.e., the myiasis-causing larvae. Remarkably, the word persists in Marāṭhī as āsāḍī (c.f. Pāḷi Āsāṭika), allowing us to understand what was meant by it.

2.8 Ritual for consecration of the cow.

**The Virupākṣa and Kāmya incantations in Mantra-brāhmaṇa 2.4**  
In 2.4 of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa we find a peculiar incantation known as the Vairūpākṣa. The initial part of it (OṂ tapaś ca tejaś ca … prapadye \|\|) is known as the Prapada. The sutra-s of Gobhila instruct the ritualist thus regarding their deployment:  
vairūpākṣaḥ purastād dhomānām \|  
The Vairūpākṣa \[is recited\] before all homa-s.  
kāmyeṣu ca prapadaḥ \|  
And at the Kāmya rites the Prapada.  
tapaś ca tejaś ce ‘ti japitvā, prāṇāyāmam āyamyā .arthamanā vairūpākṣam ārabhyo .acchvaset \|  
OṂ tapaś ca tejaś ca etc. he \[mentally\] recites while holding his breath, and should, fixing his thoughts on the object (of his homa), exhale, when beginning the \[core\] Vairūpākṣa incantation.

The Jaimini-gṛhyasūtra teaches the use of the same incantation in the context of the Agnihotra rite:  
praṇītāḥ punar āhāram ājyasya sakṛd yajuṣā dvis tūṣṇīṃ uttarato .agneḥ praṇītāḥ praṇīya darbhaiḥ pracchādya dakṣiṇato agneḥ prastaraṃ nidhāya prastarasya+upariṣṭāt pavitre nidhāya virūpākṣaṃ japati \|  
Having taken up the praṇītā (rectangular ritual trough with handle) again, he offers the ghee once with the Yajuṣ and twice silently at the north of the fire altar. Having taken forth the praṇītā, having covered it with darbha grass, having placed the prastara (ritual grass bundle) to the south of the fire altar, and having placed the pavitra (grass ring) on the prastara, he recites the Virūpākṣa.

This ritual injunction corresponds to the actions at the beginning of the Agnihotra rite and maps to the corresponding recitation at the beginning of a gṛhya rite.

Prapada:  
OṂ tapaś ca tejaś ca śraddhā ca hrīś ca satyaṃ cā krodhaś ca tyāgaś ca dhṛtiś ca dharmaś ca satvaṃ ca vāk ca manaś cātmā ca brahma ca tāni prapadye tani mām avantu \| bhūr bhuvaḥ svar oṃ \| mahāntam ātmānaṃ prapadye \|\|  
The heat (of asceticism), splendor, reverence, modesty, truth, wrath, forsaking, constancy, observance, goodness, speech, mind, consciousness, and mantra-power, in these I take my refuge, may these help me. The three vyāhṛti-s, OṂ. In the great soul, I take my refuge.

The scholiast Guṇaviṣṇu states that this nigada is dedicated to Agni in the form of Rudra with Parameṣṭhin as its ṛṣi. He states that one mediates on the self as “Rudrāgnirūpa” evidently while performing prāṇāyāma with it. Sāyaṇa clarifies that exhaling with “bhūr bhuvaḥ svar oṃ” one meditates on the self (evidently with the final part of the incantation that follows) and starts reciting the Vairūpākṣa proper incantation. Similarly, the observers of the half-monthly rite go to the forest and do japa of the Prapada (tathā ca ardhamāsa-vratī paurṇamāsyām ity upakramya+araṇye prapadaṃ japet ।). Regarding this rite, Gobhila states the following in his sūtras: 1. He does japa of the Prapada incantation sitting on a mat of Darbha grass. 2. The tips of the grass leaves are turned eastwards if he desires brahmavarcas. 3. They are placed northwards if he desires sons and cattle. 4. They are placed in both directions if he desires both.

Vairūpākṣa proper:  
virūpākṣo ‘si dantāñjis tasya te śayyā parṇe gṛhā antarikṣe vimitam̐ hiraṇmayam \| tad devānām̐ hṛdayāny ayasmaye kumbhe ‘ntaḥ saṃnihitāni \|
tāni balabhṛc ca balasāc ca rakṣato ‘pramaṇī animiṣataḥ satyam \| yat te dvādaśa putrās te tvā sam̐vatsare-sam̐vatsare kāmapreṇa yajñena yājayitvā punar brahmacaryam upayanti \| tvaṃ deveṣu brāhmaṇo ‘sy ahaṃ manuṣyeṣu brāhmaṇo vai brāhmaṇam upadhāvaty upa tvā dhāvāmi \| japantaṃ mā mā pratijāpīr juhvantaṃ mā mā pratihauṣīḥ kurvantaṃ mā mā prati-kārṣīḥ \|
tvāṃ prapadye \| tvayā prasūta idaṃ karma kariṣyāmi \| tan me rādhyatāṃ tan me samṛdhyatāṃ tan ma upapadyatām \| samudro mā viśvavyacā brahmānujānātu tutho mā viśvavedā brahmaṇaḥ putro ‘nu-jānātu \| śvātro mā pracetā maitrāvaruṇo ‘nu-jānātu \| tasmai virūpākṣāya dantāñjaye samudrāya viśvavyacase tuthāya viśva-vedase śvātrāya pracetase sahasrākṣāya brahmaṇaḥ putrāya namaḥ \|\|  
You are the odd-eyed one with gleaming tusks (Virūpākṣa Dantāñji). Your bed is made of leaves, and your house in the atmosphere is made of gold. There and in a metal vessel are placed the hearts of the gods. Balabhṛt and Balāsad carefully watch these without ever blinking. Those who are your twelve sons sacrifice to you, year after year, a wish-fulfilling sacrifice, and then go back to their study. You are the brāhmaṇa among the gods, while I am among the men. Verily, the brāhmaṇa resorts to the brāhmaṇa-s, and I take refuge in you. While I’m uttering incantations, please do not utter counter-incantations; when I am sacrificing (or invoking deities), please do not sacrifice against me; when I am acting, please do not act against me. I take refuge in you. Impelled by you, I will perform this ritual. Let it be successful for me; let it be beneficial for me; let it be fulfilled for me. May the Brahman power, which is all-encompassing like the ocean, allow it for me. May Tutha, the all-knowing one born of Brahman power, allow it for me. Śvātra, the inspirer born of Mitra and Varuṇa, allow it for me. To that Virūpākṣa Dantāñji, the all-encompassing ocean, the all-knowing Tutha, Śvātra, the inspirer, the thousand-eyed one, and son of Brahman power, obeisance.

The scholiast Sāyaṇa states that it is a nigada-rūpa-yajuṣ to Rudra-rūpāgniḥ. Both he and Guṇaviṣṇu cite the following anuṣṭubh as a description of this deity (comparable to Bhagavadgītā 13.14):  
sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaś ca sarvato .akṣi-śiro-mukhaḥ ।  
viśvarūpo mahān agniḥ praṇītaḥ sarva-karmasu ॥  
With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and faces everywhere, the all-formed great Agni is laid down in all rituals.

Regarding the epithet Dantāñji we have the following comments by the scholiasts:  
Guṇaviṣṇu: dantāñjiḥ dantān anakti vyañjayati+iti auṇādika iḥ \[uṇādi 571\] – añjū vyaktiś-lakṣaṇa-kānti-gatiṣu – vyaktadanta ity arthaḥ \|  
Sāyaṇa: tathā dantāñjiḥ \| añjū vyaktis-lakṣaṇa-kānti-gatiṣu \| dantair anakti prakāśayati+iti dantāñjiḥ \| dīpradanta ity arthaḥ \|

Both provide similar explanations; Guṇaviṣṇu cites the uṇādi-sutra-s to explain the formation of the word via the iḥ suffix. They state that añjū indicates appearance, a characteristic, beauty or gait. Thus, the word dantāñji is used in the sense of having clearly visible or gleaming teeth.

aktaṃ rihāṇā vyantu vayaḥ \|\|  
May the birds having licked the anointed \[ritual grass\] go their ways.

This incantation is used to anoint the ritual darbha with ghee.

yaḥ paśūnām adhipati rudras tanticaro vṛṣā \|  
paśūn asmākam mā hiṃsīr etad astu hutam tava svāhā \|\|  
He who is the lord of the cattle, Rudra, the bull led by the cord.  
Harm not our cattle; may this oblation be yours. Svāhā.

This incantation is used in the darbha-mat fire rite to Rudra. Two oblations, respectively of ghee and a sthālīpāka are made with it.

Rudra-putra:  
sahasrabāhur gaupatyaḥ sa paśūn abhirakṣatu \|  
mayi puṣṭiṃ puṣṭipatir dadhātu mayi prajāṃ prajāpatiḥ \| svāhā \|\|  
May the thousand-armed son of the lord of the cows protect the cattle.  
May the lord of nourishment grant me nourishment. May the lord of the folks grant me progeny. Svāhā.

This incantation is used to make offerings in the kāmya homa to the thousand-handed son of Rudra. It is performed in front of the water trough in the cow pen with oblations of rice and barley. It represents an interesting proto-form of Skanda. Sāyaṇa states this represents the Marut-s or the Vayu-s, connecting the son of Rudra mentioned here with the Marut-s in the saṃhitā-s.

kautomatam̐ sam̐vananam̐ subhāgaṃ karaṇaṃ mama \|  
nākulī nāma te mātāthāhaṃ puruṣāmayaḥ \|  
yan nau kāmasya vicchinnaṃ tan nau saṃdhehy oṣadhe \|\|  
Kautomata, completely winning and fortunate, is my action.  
Nākulī (the mongoose goddess) is the name of your mother; now, I am endowed with men.  
Whatever is broken apart in our desires, bring those together in concordance, O plant.

This incantation is for the offering of consecrated fruits of great fig trees to gain association with a person (according to Sāyaṇa for gaining assistance or friendship). Gobhila states that he should keep an even number of fruits with himself, which counts to one more than the number he gives to a person with whom he seeks to associate for help or friendship. The word Kautomata in this incantation is enigmatic. Guṇaviṣṇu states that it is the name of this incantation as its ṛṣi is Kutomant. Sāyaṇa, however, etymologizes it thus: “kutaḥ kutrāpi nāsti amatam asampratipannaṃ yasya tat kutomatam udumbarādi \| tasya saṃbandhi phalaṃ kautomatam \|” He sees it that which is not accepted as existing anywhere (kuto .amatam), i.e., the flower of the udumbara (the fig emerges without a flower as understood by the lay people); hence, he takes kutomata to be the great figs like udumbara and kautomata as its fruit.

The following 5 ṛk-s are used in multiple vrata-s. The first is a peculiar one for obtaining land: After fasting for a fortnight or only eating rice gruel, in which he can see his reflection, once a day, he goes to a perennial pool on the full moon night. Plunging into it up to his navel, he sacrifices with each of the five verses, casting fried grains with his mouth into the water with a svāhā. In the next rite, with the first verse, he sacrifices facing the sun within the sight of a rich person from whom he desires a donation. With the second verse, he sacrifices when there is a halo around the sun to increase his stock of horses and elephants. With the third verse, he sacrifices when there is a halo around the moon to increase his cattle. With the fourth verse, he worships facing the sun to acquire wealth and return safely. With the fifth verse, he worships facing the sun to return safely to his home.

vṛkṣa iva pakvas tiṣṭhasi sarvān kāmān bhuvaspate \|  
yas tvainam̐ veda tasmai me bhogān dhukṣvākṣatān bṛhan \|\|  
Like a ripe tree, you stand; \[fulfill\] all my desires, o lord of the world. For those who thus know you, to me give everlasting pleasures, o great \[one\].

ṛtam̐ satye pratiṣṭhitaṃ bhūtaṃ bhaviṣyatā saha \|  
ākāśa upanirajjatu mahyam annam atho śriyam \|\|  
The natural law is established in truth; the past comes with the future. May the space be bound; for me, food and fortune.

abhibhāgo ‘si sarvasmim̐s tad u sarvaṃ tvayi śritam \|  
tena sarveṇa sarvo mā vivāsana vivāsaya \|\|  
You are a portion of everything; hence, all rests in you. With this entirety, one who is all, banishing, do not banish me.  
(Note parallel in the epithet sarva to the Iranic deity Zurvan)

kośa iva pūrṇo vasunā tvaṃ prīto dadase dhanam \|  
adṛṣṭo dṛṣṭam ābhara sarvān kāmān prayaccha me \|\|  
Like a treasury full of wealth, you being pleased, give riches. The invisible one brings the visible; fulfill for me all desires.

ākāśasyaiṣa ākāśo yad etad bhāti maṇḍalam \|  
evaṃ tvā veda yo vedeśāneśān prayaccha me \|\|  
This is the space of space, which is the sphere shining there. Who know you thus, o lord (Īśāna) of the Veda-s (or knowledge), provide for me lordships \[over various things\].

The significance of Virūpākṣa Dantāñji  
The name Virupākṣa is a rare but specific name for Rudra found in other Vedic texts. While rare, the name has early IE connections: comparable ocular features are seen in the Germanic cognate of Rudra, Óðinn (he is one-eyed, thus, odd- or different-eyed mapping on to Virupākṣa: c.f., Sāmavedic name of Rudra, Ekākṣa). Probably the oldest use of Virupākṣa is in the incantation against rival debaters in the Atharvaveda Paippalāda-saṃhitā 20.55.10:  
śarveṇa nīlaśikhaṇḍena bhavena marutāṃ pitrā ।  
virūpākṣeṇa babhrūṇā vācaṃ vadiṣyato hatam ॥  
By Śarva, Nīlaśikhaṇḍa, Bhava, the father of the Marut-s,  
By Virūpākṣa (odd-eyed), Babhru (brownish), may the speech of those who speak \[opposing us\] be smitten.

The second occurrence is in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 10.41 in the famous Mṛtyulāṅgala mantra, used in the daily worship of Rudra, which is presented in a semi-grammatical form:  
ṛtam̐ satyaṃ paraṃ brahma puruṣaṃ kṛṣṇa-piṅgalam ।  
ūrdhvaretaṃ virūpākṣaṃ viśvarūpāya vai namo namaḥ ॥  
\[I salute\] The natural law, truth, the foremost, mantra-power, the puruṣa, the dark yellow (blackish yellow) one, with an upward seminal flow, the odd-eyed one. Verily, repeated obeisance to him of all forms.

It is notable that in both cases, the god is described as being of similar color (brownish) or dark yellow. While the Sāmavedic attestation of Virūpākṣa does not mention his color, it presents multiple epithets that are reminiscent of epithets of Rudra in the Yajurveda:  
1. His golden house is reminiscent of his golden associations, e.g., TA 10.40:  
namo hiraṇyabāhave hiraṇyavarṇāya hiraṇyarūpāya hiraṇyapataye .ambikāpataya umāpataye paśupataye namo namaḥ \|\|  
2. His leafy bed is reminiscent of the term parṇaśadya (heap of fallen leaves) used in the Śatarudrīya.  
3. The hearts of the gods kept in the metal vessel in his dwelling is reminiscent of the phrase namo vaḥ kirikebhyo devānām̐ hṛdayebhyaḥ । applied to the Rudra-s in the Śatarudrīya.  
These observations strongly support the scholiasts’ identification of Virūpākṣa in the Sāmavedic texts with Rudra.

While the second epithet of the deity Dantāñji is, to our knowledge, not found anywhere outside these Sāmavedic texts, we believe that this epithet has major significance for the evolution of Gaṇapati, a popular deity in the later Hindu tradition. Within the late Sāmavedic tradition, their pariśiṣṭa text (Chandoga-pariśiṣṭa or Karmapradīpa) attributed to Gobhila (it is also called Gobhila-smṛti) furnishes one of the early examples of Gaṇeśa worship, wherein he is invoked together with the Lokamāṭṛ-s (Gaurī, Padmā, Śacī, Medhā, Sāvitrī, Vijayā, Jayā, Devasenā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Dhṛti, Puṣṭi and Tuṣṭi) at the beginning of all rites:  
gaurī padmā śacī medhā sāvitrī vijayā jayā । devasenā svadhā svāhā mātaro lokamātaraḥ ॥  
dhṛtiḥ puṣṭis tathā tuṣṭir ātmadevatayā saha । gaṇeśeṇādhikā hotā vṛddhau pūjyācaturdaśa \|  
karmādiṣu ca sarveṣu mātaraḥ sagaṇādhipāḥ । pūjanīyā: prayatnena pūjitāḥ pūjayanti tāḥ ॥

This establishes that there was continuity within the Sāmavedic tradition of Gaṇeśa worship.

There are several lines of connections, of differing strengths between Virūpākṣa Dantāñji and the later day Gaṇeśa:  
1. His most definitive feature is his clearly visible or gleaming teeth – this implies that the Rudra Virūpākṣa Dantāñji was seen as a tusked or fanged figure. While a trunk or an elephant face is not mentioned explicitly, the presence of this dental peculiarity likely served as a locus for further development towards Gaṇeśa.  
2. Like Gaṇeśa, Virūpākṣa Dantāñji is worshipped at the beginning of rites and for their success. He is associated with the divine brāhmaṇa: a parallel is seen in the god Brahṃaṇaspati, the divine brāhmaṇa, whose incantation has the earliest use of the epithet Gaṇapati.  
3. Like Gaṇeśa, Virūpākṣa Dantāñji is invoked to not obstruct the rite that is being performed.  
4. There is an allusion to the sons of Rudra, who enact a wish-fulfilling sacrifice: this provides a launching pad for Gaṇeśa as the son of Rudra.  
5. The kāmya rituals that follow this section invoke the son of Rudra, suggesting that this concept was readily available in the tradition for “crystallization.”  
6. Finally, the peculiar element of his epithet añji is uniquely associated with the Marut-s, the sons of Rudra, in the Ṛgveda. For example, we have:  
ye pṛṣatībhir ṛṣṭibhiḥ sākaṃ vāśībhir añjibhiḥ । ajāyanta svabhānavaḥ ॥ RV 1.37.2  
Here añji is typically translated as “unguent”, a word of old IE pedigree with respect to that etymology. However, it is mentioned here in the context of the weapons of the Marut-s: ṛṣṭi (spear) and vāśī (battle pickaxe). Another example of the same is:  
ye añjiṣu ye vāśīṣu svabhānavaḥ srakṣu rukmeṣu khādiṣu । RV 5.53.4ab  
Here again, añji is mentioned with the battle pickaxe, armor, gauntlets and garlands. Thus, Virūpākṣa Dantāñji bears a tusk/fang as an añji just as the Marut-s bear their añji. The añji of the Marut-s is also notably said to be brilliant white in color. So, it could mean the lighting weapon/form or an ornamentation of the Marut-s. This makes it a potential analogy for the brilliant tooth of Virūpākṣa Dantāñji and indicates a further link between the conception of the sons of Rudra in the old tradition and this deity.

Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest the early precursors of Gaṇeśa coalescing around this deity of the Sāmavedic tradition.
