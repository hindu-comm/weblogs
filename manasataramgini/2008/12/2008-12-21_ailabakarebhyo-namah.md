Facing south we sung the jarAbodhIya and sprinkling water with a clump
of darbha from the pot into which had been stirred in the black tila. We
place the piyAru-s in the mouths of the howling dogs of rudra:  
“*rudrasyailabakArebhyo .asaMsUktagirebhyaH \|  
idaM mahAsyebhyaH shvabhyo .akaraM namaH \|\|*”  
rudra’s howling dogs that devour their prey whole  
To these dogs with mighty maw I humbly offer obeisance.
