The duel drew out with the adversaries for a while. It was slow moving with neither side being able to cut lose or declare victory. yakShiNI-s and kR^ityA-s flew by. We gathered our armor but knew that the rAkShasI could come after we feel asleep and would try to break our armor. We decided to try to intercept that duly. Tomorrow we would know how the struggle will play out.
