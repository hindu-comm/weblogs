The Atharvanic tradition records a special rudra gAyatrI that might be used in regular japa in place of the traditional rudra sAvitrI. This mantra is:  
tasmai devAya vidhmahe \| mahAdevAya dhImahi \| tan no rudro .anumanyatAM \|\|  
This is known as the atharvashikha and is high mantra for those on the mAheshvara path.
