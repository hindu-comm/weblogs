The gods in triples

It is clear that every civilization has its own unique manifest characteristics coming from the depths of its people. One such distinguishing characteristic of the Hindu civilization is the love for huge numbers. This even manifests in the number of gods in the pantheon. The Ṛgveda (RV) is replete with numbers. However, they are mostly modest relative to the magnitudes encountered in somewhat younger Vedic texts. Among those that go into the thousands, we encounter a peculiar number that is repeated in multiple places across the Vedic tradition — the number of gods, which is specified as 3339. This number is found twice in the RV itself (3.9.9a, 10.52.6a), with both verses presenting the identical hemistich:

trīṇi śatā trī sahasrāṇy agniṃ triṃśac ca devā nava cāsaparyan ।  
Three hundred, three thousand, and thirty-nine gods attentively served Agni.

This number again occurs as the number of the gods in the Vaiśvadeva-nivid and the Taittirīya Brāhmana (in 2.7.12.2). We encounter explanations for this number in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.3.1-11 (also repeated in a variant form in its Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat 3.9.1-9) and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 2.76-77 in the context of a brahmodya contest in the court of emperor Janaka Vaideha that resulted in the death of Vidagdha Śākalya. Below we provide the version from the JB:

janako ha vaideho bahudakṣiṇena yajñeneje । te tad u ha kuru-pañcālānāṃ brāhmaṇā abhisamājagmuḥ । sa ha sahasraṃ gavām avarundhāna uvāca brāhmaṇā etā vo, yo brahmiṣṭhas sa udajatām iti । sa hovāca vājasaneyo ‘rvācīr etās somyeti । taṃ hocus tvaṃ nu no brahmiṣṭho ‘sī3 iti । sa hovāca namo vo brahmiṣṭhāya+astu । gokāmā eva vayaṃ sma iti । te hocuḥ ko na imaṃ prakṣyatīti । sa hovāca vidagdhaś śākalyo ‘ham iti । taṃ ha puraskṛteyeyuḥ । taṃ ha pratikhyāyāyantam uvāca tvāṃ svic chākalya brāhmaṇā ulmukāvakṣayaṇam akratā3 iti । sa hovāca yadi tenolmukāvakṣayaṇaṃ smaḥ prakṣyāmo nvai tvām iti । taṃ ha papraccha kati devā yājñavalkyeti । sa hovāca trayaś ca triṃśac ca, trayaś ca trī ca śatā, trayaś ca trī ca sahasrā, yāvanto nividābhyāhūtā iti । om iti hovāca ॥2.76॥  
Janaka the Vaideha had performed a sacrifice with abundant gifts. The brāhmaṇa-s of the Kuru and the Pañcāla went there together. He (Janaka), having corralled a thousand cows, said: “O you brāhmaṇa-s he, who of you all is the foremost in brahminical proficiency, may drive \[these cattle\] along”. He Vājasaneya said: “Towards \[me\] these Soma \[ritual\] gifts.” \[The brāhmana-s\] said to him: “Now, are you brahminically most proficient among us?” He \[Yājñavalkya Vājasaneya\] responded: “So be it; salutations to the brahminically most proficient, but we desire the cattle.” They (the V1s) said: “Who will question him (Yājñavalkya) for us?” Then, he, Vidagdha Śākalya, said: “I \[will\].” Then, he may go forward. Seeing him coming forth, (Yājñavalkya) said: “Hey Śākalya, the brāhmana-s have made you \[one\] to quench the fire-brand.” He (Śākalya) said: “If indeed we are the one to quench the firebrand \[so be it\], we will now question you.” \[Śākalya\] questioned him: “O Yājñavalkya, how many gods are there?” He (Yājñavalkya) said: “3 and 30, 3 and 300, 3 and 3000, as many as are sacrificed to in the \[Vaiśvadeva\]-nivid.” He (Śākalya) said: “yes.”

katy eva devā iti । traya iti । om iti hovāca । katya eva devā iti । dvāv iti । om iti hovāca । katy eva devā iti । eka iti । om iti hovāca । katame trayaś ca triṃśac ca, trayaś ca trī ca śatā, trayaś ca trī ca sahasreti । mahimāna evaiṣāṃ ta iti hovāca । trayastriṃśad vāvet । katame trayastriṃśad iti । aṣṭau vasava ekādaśa rudrā dvādaśādityā indraś caiva prajāpatiś ca trayastriṃśāv iti ।  
“But how many gods are there?” Three. He (Śākalya) said: “Yes, but how many gods are there?” Two. He (Śākalya) said: “Yes, but how many gods are there?” One. He (Śākalya) said: “Yes. Who are the 33+303+3003?” He (Yājñavalkya) said: “These are their powers, but they are 33 \[in number\].” “Who are the 33?” “8 Vasu-s, 11 Rudra-s, 12 Āditya-s, Indra and Prajāpati amounting to 33.”

katame vasava iti । agniś ca pṛthivī ca vāyuś cāntarikṣaṃ cādityaś ca dyauś ca candramāś ca nakṣatrāṇi caite vasavaḥ । eteṣu hīdaṃ sarvaṃ vasu hitam iti । tasmād vasava iti ।  
“Who are the Vasu-s?” “The Fire, Earth, Air, Mid-space, Sun, Heavens, Moon and the Stars — these are the Vasu-s. In these, verily all this (the universe) is situated (in residence — vas-). Hence, they are known as the Vasu-s.”

katame rudrā iti daśa puruṣe prāṇā iti hovāca । ātmaikādaśaḥ । te yadotkrāmanto yanty atha rodayanti । tasmād rudrā iti ।  
“Who are the Rudra-s?” He (Yājñavalkya) said: “The 10 life processes in a man; the 11th is the conscious self. When they go out and leave, they cause crying (death). Hence, they are known as the Rudra-s.”

katama ādityā iti । dvādaśa māsās saṃvatsara iti hovāca । eta ādityāḥ । ete hīdaṃ sarvam ādadānā yanti । tasmād ādityā iti । katame traya iti । ima eva lokā iti ।  
“Who are the Āditya-s?” He (Yājñavalkya) said: “12 months \[comprising\] the year. They move on taking hold (Adad-) of all of this (the universe); hence, they are the Āditya-s.” “Who are the 3?” “Verily, these 3 worlds.”

katamau dvāv iti । ahorātrāv iti ।  
“Who are the 2?” “Day and night.”

katama indraḥ, katamaḥ prajāpatir iti । vāg evendro, manaḥ prajāpatir iti ।  
“Who is Indra; who is Prajāpati?” “Speech is indeed Indra; the mind is Prajāpati.”

  
katamaikā devateti । prāṇa iti । sa hovāca+anatipraśnyāṃ vai mā devatām aty aprākṣīḥ, puraitāvata tithyā martāsi । na te śarīrāṇi cana gṛhān prāpsyantīti । tad dha vai tathaivāsa । sa ha tathaiva mamāra । tasya hāpahāriṇo ‘nantareṇa śarīrāṇy apajahrur anyan manyamānāḥ । tasmād u ha nopavadet । api hy evaṃ vit paro bhavatīti ॥2.77॥  
“Who is the one god?” “the life-process (literally: Breath).” He (Yājñavalkya) said: Beyond that, there must be no questioning; you have questioned me beyond the deity. You will die on such a foretold tithi (lunar date). Not even \[your\] body parts will reach home. Indeed, that came to be. He (Śākalya) verily died that very way. Thereafter, thieves took away his body parts taking him to be someone else. Hence, let no one abuse; for even by knowing this, he gets the better \[of his rival\].

Thus, this dramatic narration gives us the first example of a “[pearl necklace number](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/pearl-necklaces-for-mahesvara/)” sequence and its sum. These necklace numbers are named so for the problem of Maheśvara’s necklace in the Gaṇita-tilaka of Śrīpati of the Kāśyapa clan from the 1000s of CE. They are defined as palindromic decimal numbers with identical digits in the ones and largest places and zeroes in all the intervening places (pearls). Thus, here we have the first 3 necklace numbers with 3 as their terminal: 33, 303, and 3003, whose sum is the number of gods first mentioned in the RV and the Vaiśvadeva-nivid. Interestingly, a number of investigators (most explicitly in the published literature by Iyengar), including ourselves, have noticed that this number is an approximation of the number of tithi-s in a sar (a half saros eclipse cycle). The number of tithi-s in a synodic month is 30. A synodic month is 29.53059 days; thus, an average tithi is 0.984353 days. Thus, in a year of 365.242 mean solar days, we have approximately ![\tfrac{365.242}{0.984353}=371.05 \approx 371](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B365.242%7D%7B0.984353%7D%3D371.05+%5Capprox+371&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) tithi-s, a number known from the Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa. A sar is ![9.015 \approx 9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=9.015+%5Capprox+9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) years. Hence, we get ![3339 = 9 \times 371](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3339+%3D+9+%5Ctimes+371&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002). One could argue that this is a mere coincidence; however, that is dispelled by the record of this number in a specifically astronomical context in the ancient Hindu account of the Moon preserved in the Brahmāṇḍapurāna (1.23.51-1.23.79), wherein this number is specifically mentioned (1.23.68) in such a way that it can only imply the sar cycle. Further, the Brahmāṇḍapurāna mentions this number in the context of the gods drinking from the celestial soma cup, the Moon. Indeed, even in the Vaiśvadeva-nivid, this is precisely the context in which the number is mentioned; hence, it is likely that the eclipse cycle connection is an ancient one:  
viśvedevās somasya matsan । viśve vaiśvānarāḥ । viśve viśvamahasaḥ । mahi mahanataḥ । pakvānnā nemadhitīvānaḥ । āskrāḥ pacata vāhasaḥ । vātātmāno agni-jūtāḥ । ye dyāṃ ca pṛthivīṃ ca ātasthuḥ । apaś ca svaś ca । brahma ca kṣatraṃ ca । barhiś ca vediṃ ca । yajñaṃ ca uru cāntarikṣam । ye stha traya ekādaśāḥ । trayaś ca triṃśac ca । trayaś ca trī ca śatā । trayaś ca trī ca sahasrā । tāvanto abhiṣācaḥ । tāvanto rāti ṣacāḥ । tāvatīḥ patnīḥ । tāvatīr gnāḥ । tāvanta udaraṇe । tāvanto niveśane । ato vā devā bhūyāṃsastha । mā vo devā atiśaṣā mā pariśasā vikṣi । viśve devā iha śravann iha somasya matsan । pra imām devā deva hūtim avantu devyā dhiyā । pra idam brahma । pra idam kṣatram । pra imam sunvantam yajamānam avantu । citrāś citābhir ūtibhiḥ । śravan brahmāṇy āvasā gaman ॥  

While the Brahmāṇḍapurāna accurately preserves this number and the basis of its significance, certain other later scriptural texts only have a hazy and imprecise memory of it. An example of this is seen in the chapter on the particulars of a Śivaliṅga of Aṃśumadāgama of the Śaiva tradition:  
trīṇi caiva tu triṃśac ca triśata trisahasrakam ।  
devatā ṛṣayaś caiva dānavāpsara-yonayaḥ ॥51.7॥  
The number here is 3333, but it is clearly an imprecise memory of the original count.

There are related reckonings in the śruti itself. A curious one relating to the number 1000 is offered by the brāhmaṇa on the ukhā fire-pot in TS 5.5.2. When the god Prajāpati handed over the ukhā to the Vasu-s, they multiplied themselves to 333 in 3 days. Then he handed it over to the Rudra-s, and they multiplied themselves to 333 in 6 days. Finally, he handed it over to the Āditya-s, and they, too, multiplied themselves to 333 in 12 days. Thus, they became a total of 999, and with the ukhā to top it off, they became a 1000. He who knows this enumeration with the fire-pot as the thousandth is said to obtain a thousand cattle. This count appears to be an alternative enumeration of the triadic numbers and the relationship between them and a thousand.

Nevertheless, returning to Yājñavalkya’s account, we can see that, more generally, these triadic numbers clearly relate to the old Indo-European concept of tripartition, which is acknowledged both by tradition and modern-day non-practicing Indo-Europeanists, viz., the Dumezilianists. This is seen across the board, be it in Yājñavalkya’s expression of 3339 as a sum of 3 pearl necklace numbers; or the ukhā-brāhmaṇa’s 333 and a triple thereof, or in what Yājñavalkya presents as the basic number of gods – 33. While Yājñavalkya accounts for this number in a certain way, other enumerations are seen in tradition; for example, the Rāmāyaṇa implies 8 Vasu-s, 11 Rudra-s, 12 Āditya-s and 2 Aśvin-s:  
adityāṃ jajñire devās trayastriṃśad ariṃdama ।  
ādityā vasavo rudrā aśvinau ca paraṃtapa ॥ 3.13.14c-15a (“critical edition”)  
From Aditi were born the 33 deva-s, O foe-crusher (i.e., Rāma): the Āditya-s (12), the Vasu-s (8), the Rudra-s (11) and the twin Aśvin-s (2), O foe-scorcher.

Nevertheless, all accounts agree that within the 33 are included the three main classes of gods Vasu-s, Rudra-s and Āditya-s. This number is also explicitly presented as a triple of 11s to reinforce the old IE tripartition. Thus, the concluding incantation, which is deployed after the construction of the fire altar of Naciketas and before the great oblations to Rudra with the Śatarudrīya are offered, wherein the series of numbers from 1 to 33, signifying the gods is recited, has:  
devās trir ekādaśās tris trayastri ̐ śāḥ ।

This brings to mind an older statement of this number in the RV in the Praügaśastra of the rājarṣi Paruchepa Daivodāsi:  
ye devāso divy ekādaśa stha pṛthivyām adhy ekādaśa stha ।  
apsukṣito mahinaikādaśa stha te devāso yajñam imaṃ juṣadhvam ॥ RV 1.139.11c  
O you eleven gods stationed in heaven,  
the eleven who are established on earth,  
the eleven who with their greatness dwell in water,  
\[all\] you gods take pleasure in this ritual.

In both these cases, the gods are presented as a triad of 11s. This enumeration offered by Paruchepa also brings to mind the 3 gods of Yājñavalkya as the 3 worlds. Indeed, after the series (1..33) recited in the Naciketas ritual, there is a terminal triple vyāhṛti oblation: bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ svāhā । signifying the 3 worlds.

However, despite the inherent tripartition, as far as we can see, 33 as the count of gods is a unique feature of the Āryan religion, with no earlier IE antecedents. Despite the Zoroastrian counter-religious transformation, we see this count even in the Iranian tradition. It occurs multiple times in the Yasna of 70 chapters and is connected to an equal number of “ratu-s” (articulations) or saṃbandha-s of the Iranian tradition. Indeed, this connection to ratu-s is also reflected in the Yajurveda on the Hindu side in the form of the 33 “threads” that connect the ritual to the gods (trayastri ̐ śat tantavo ye vitatnire ya imaṃ yajña ̐ svadhayā dadante । in TS 1.5.10). An example of the connection between the 33 ratu-s and deities is seen in the invocation used in the Iranian Yasna before the combined invocation of Ahura and Mithra (Vedic: Mitrāvaruṇā):  
nivaêdhayemi hañkârayemi vîspaêibyô aêibyô ratubyô ýôi heñti ashahe ratavô thrayasca thrisãsca nazdishta pairish-hâvanayô ýôi heñti ashahe ýat vahishtahe mazdô-frasâsta zarathushtrô- fraoxta \| Y 1.10  
I announce (and) carry out (this Yasna) for all those ratu-s, for who are the lords of the ratu-s, for the Asha (=Vedic Ṛta), the 33, those approaching near, those around the Havana, who were instituted as lords of the Asha Vahishta by Ahura Mazda, and were promulgated by Zarathushtra.

Similarly, several references to the 33 gods are present throughout the RV and the Yajurveda texts:  
patnīvatas triṃśataṃ trīṃś ca devān anuṣvadham ā vaha mādayasva ॥ RV 3.6.9c

trayā devā ekādaśa । trayastri ̐ śāḥ surādhasaḥ । bṛhaspati-purohitāḥ । devasya savituḥ save । devā devair avantu mā । prathamā dvitīyaiḥ । dvitīyās tṛtīyaiḥ । tṛtīyāḥ satyena । satyaṃ yajñena । yajño yajurbhiḥ । yajū ̐ ṣi sāmabhiḥ । sāmāny ṛgbhiḥ । ṛco yājyābhiḥ । yājyā vaṣaṭkāraiḥ । vaṣaṭkārā āhutibhiḥ । āhutayo me kāmānt samardhayantu । bhūḥ svāhā ॥ TB 2.6.5.26  
The gods are ![3 \times 11](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+11&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002); 33 bountiful ones; they have Brhaspati as their chief priest; at the impulse of the god Savitṛ; may the gods help me with the gods; the first ones with the second ones; the second ones with the third ones; the third ones with the truth; the truth with the ritual, the ritual with the yajuṣ-es; the yajuṣ-es with the sāman-s; the sāman-s with the ṛk-s; the ṛk-s with the yājya-s (offering verses); the yājya-s with the vaṣaṭ calls; the vaṣaṭ calls with the oblations. May the oblations make my wishes successful. svāhā to Bhū (the first vyāhṛti).

The above formula is used for the offering of the fat of the sacrificed animal in the Sautrāmaṇi sacrifice.

How did this number 33 emerge in the Āryan tradition in the first place? The number 11 is suspiciously close to the Greek Dodecad — a number going back to the PIE traditions and eventually provided for the [Āditya-s in Hindu tradition](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/a-note-on-the-pantheon-of-the-indian-saura-tradition/). This makes one wonder if 11 is related to that number (12). If so, 33 might have emerged by intertwining 11 with the old tripartition along the lines of the gods of the 3 worlds, something also apparent in the Greek tradition. However, there is also an astronomical possibility: The synodic month is ![\approx 29.53](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+29.53&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) days; hence, 12 lunar months with 30 tithi-s each amount to 354.36 days, which is short of the solar year of 365.24 days. Thus, every year the lunar 12-month cycle drifts away from the solar year. After 3 years, this difference is approximately 33 days or one additional lunar month. This 13th month could then be added to fix the alignment. A hint that such a process might have been practiced in the pre-Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa days is hinted by a ṛk of Śunaḥśepa:  
veda māso dhṛtavrato dvādaśa prajāvataḥ ।  
vedā ya upajāyate ॥ RV.1.25.8  
He whose laws are upheld knows the twelve months with offspring (the two parvan-s of the synodic month).  
He knows that which that is born afterward (the 13th month — leap month).

Another place the number 33 appears in this regard relates to the luni-solar cycle: after 33 solar years the first of the 12 lunar months and solar year will approximately commence at the same time: ![12 \times 29.53 \times 34 \approx 33 \times 365. 24](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12+%5Ctimes+29.53+%5Ctimes+34+%5Capprox+33+%5Ctimes+365.+24&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002). This connection may be what is behind a curious brāhmaṇa seen in the TS:  
prajāpates trayastri ̐ śad duhitara āsan; tāḥ somāya rājñe ‘dadāt; tāsā ̐ rohiṇīm upait; tā īrṣyantīḥ punar agacchan; tā anv ait; tāḥ punar ayācata; tā asmai na punar adadāt; so .abravīt । ṛtam amīṣva yathā samāvaccha upaiṣyāmy atha te punar dāsyāmīti; sa ṛtam āmīt; tā asmai punar adadāt; tāsā ̐ rohiṇīm evopait; taṃ yakṣma ārchat । rājānaṃ yakṣma ārad iti tad rājayakṣmasya janma yat pāpīyān abhavat tat pāpayakṣmasya yaj jāyābhyo ‘vindat taj jāyenyasya; ya evam eteṣāṃ yakṣmāṇāṃ janma veda nainam ete yakṣmā vindanti; sa etā eva namasyann upādhāvat; tā abruvan; varaṃ vṛṇāmahai samāvaccha eva na upāya iti; tasmā etam ādityaṃ caruṃ nir avapan; tenaivainam pāpāt srāmād amuñcan; yaḥ pāpayakṣmagṛhītaḥ syāt tasmā etam ādityaṃ caruṃ nir vapet । ādityān eva svena bhāgadheyenopa dhāvati; ta evainaṃ pāpāth srāmān muñcanti; amāvāsyāyāṃ nirvapet; amum evainam āpyāyamānam anv ā pyāyayati; navonavo bhavati jāyamāna iti puro’nuvākyā bhavaty āyur evāsmin tayā dadhāti; yam ādityā a ̐ śum āpyāyayantīti yājyaivainam etayā pyāyayati ॥TS 2.3.5

Prajāpati had 33 daughters. He gave them to King Soma. Of them, he went to Rohiṇī \[more often\]. They returned \[to their paternal home\] in jealousy. He (Soma) followed them and asked for them again; He (Prajāpati) would not return them to him; He (Prajāpati) said, ‘Take an oath (literally abide by the natural law ṛta) that you will equally associate \[with them\], then I will return \[them\] to you.’ He (Soma) took the oath. He (Prajāpati) returned them. Of them, he went (preferred) to Rohiṇī only. A disease seized him, “Illness has seized the king”, that is the origin of the royal disease. In that he became worse, \[it gets the name\] of the ‘bad illness.’ As he got it from his wives, that is (the origin) of the \[name\] “from the wife”. These diseases do not overcome him who knows the origins of these diseases. He (Soma) approached them (the 33 wives) respectfully. They said: “Let us choose a boon; May you resort to us equally.” They offered this oblation to the Āditya-s for him. With that, they freed him from his evil suffering. He should offer this oblation to the Āditya-s for him who is seized by an evil illness. Indeed, he approaches the Āditya-s with their own share. Verily they free him from his evil suffering. He should offer on the new moon. Indeed, with its waxing, he makes him wax. The puronuvākyā verse is, “He is born ever new…”; verily, he bestows life upon him thereby. The yājya verse is, “The ray (the moon) which the Āditya-s make to wax”; verily thereby he makes him wax.

This is a variant of a famous myth, which is often repeated in the Veda and the Purāṇa-s, that suggests a special connection of Soma to Rohiṇī. In the Veda, two stars are known by the name Rohiṇī — ![\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) Tauri (Aldebaran) and ![\alpha](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) Scorpii (Antares) — both orange/red stars that fit the meaning of Rohiṇī (ruddy). Modern calculations suggest that the lunar occultations of these stars are, on the whole, more frequent than those of the other bright stars. [As we have noted before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/04/19/making-an-illustrated-nak%e1%b9%a3atra-sukta-and-finding-the-constellation-for-a-point-in-the-sky/), this famous Rohiṇi is perhaps a reflection of the early Indo-Aryan recognition of the frequent occultation of these red stars. However, where TS 2.3.5 differs from those in other texts (e.g., the Maitrāyaṇīya Saṃhitā 2.2.7) is in specifying the number of wives of Soma as 33! All other texts give this number as 27/28, which is the number of nakṣatra-s. The myth makes natural sense when applied to the nakṣatra-s corresponding to the circuit of the moon in a sidereal month of 27.32 days. However, 33 is neither close to that nor a synodic month. Yet, its incorporation into this version of the famous myth suggests that it has astronomical significance. While the reference to the Āditya-s, deities with a solar dimension in the standard form of the myth is an ancient acknowledgment of the moon being illuminated by the sun in its phases, here the “restoration” by the Āditya-s might be an attempt to bring in the “conjunction” of the 12 lunar month cycle and the solar year. The lunar “year” of 12 lunar months is restored to the solar year after the moon has passed through 33 solar years worth of lunar months.

The basic triadic structure persisted throughout the history of Hindu tradition. On one hand, 33 was the base number which was expanded to ![33 \times 10^7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=33+%5Ctimes+10%5E7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) (e.g., the Aruṇācala Māhātmya 6, of the mega-Skandapurāṇa where this number of gods are said to have been emanated by Rudra). On the other, just 3 of them were picked to be the principal deities comprising a trinity. This trinity essentialized the three ancient classes Vasu-s, Rudra-s, and Āditya-s by keeping one exemplar of each (Brahman being the father figure Dyaus now recast as the protogonic Prajāpati).
