Many seeds greatly fascinated me when I was young (actually they
continue to do so) . One of these was the rosary pea (Abrus
precatorius). The other was the castor seed. When we had beheld the
all-bewitching Kappa Hayastanika, like most other mortals, we had
uttered the words:

“aho rUpaM aho dhAma aho asyA navaM vayaH / ka\~Nja-palAshAkShi vAmoru
mathnatIva manAMsi naH /tvaM asi sharIriNAM sarvendriya-manaH-prItiM //
“

Kappa told me in reply that the rosary pea is a very instructive lesson
in life. “With the masura seeds we might survive, though the mAshA would
be a better alternative for life…”
