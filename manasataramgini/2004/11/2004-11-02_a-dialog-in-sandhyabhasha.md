R called me to describe her views on the lalitArchanachandrika. This
lead to a discussion of the sandhyAbhASha used in the text. So we had
this conversation in mlechChita-manipravala SB.  
  
I: “I feel close to jaya but there is a strange bhaya due to
precedence”  
  
R: “Are you really sure that you are close to jaya ?”  
  
I: “That it is good point, I was close to grabbing the Hvarena- same
time different cycle. Like Frangrasyan (though not is his physical state
:-)) I tried to grab it but failed. The failure almost happened as
thought from the blue.”  
  
R: “Indeed that seems like a shakuna. But the inner nAlika seems to be
functional.”  
  
I: “Ananda- will the root of that work”
