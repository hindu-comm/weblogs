The Dvādaśa-śloka of the Paścimāmnāya

![image_fx\_ (59)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image_fx_-59.png)

*Rudraśakti*

While the four core āmnāya-s of the kaula tradition are presented by its texts (e.g., [Ciñciṇīmata-sāra-samuccaya](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/04/24/the-amnayas-of-the-chinchini-mata-sara-sammuchaya/)) as directional lodges, they also have an evolutionary relationship between themselves (we leave out the late, clearly syncretic ūrdhvāmnāya formulations in this consideration). Though it is fair to say that each āmnāya had its own distinct core, their extant tantra-s show a directional pattern of influence by the other āmnāya-s. In this regard, the Pūrvāmnāya (Trika) appears to have branched off the earliest and shows the least influence of the other āmnāya-s. The Paścimāmnāya (Kubjikāmata or Ciñciṇīmata) occupies a central position with clear influences of the Pūrvāmnāya. In turn, it influences the classic Dakṣiṇāmnāya (śrīkula, Tripurāmata) in whose development it played a key role. The Uttarāmnāya (Kalīkula) seems to have had a deep history of its own but was influenced by the other āmnāya-s. Especially in the later phase, it developed clear parallels to the Dakṣiṇāmnāya. The Paścimāmnāya features several stava-s that are central to the practice of its initiates. These stava-s include the Mālinī-stava, the Bhairava-stotra, the Kubjikā-daṇḍaka, the Ādyogha-daṇḍaka, the Kubjikā-stuti of chapter 16 of the Vārāhī-tantra, and the Dvādaśa-śloka of the Manthāna-bhairava-tantra (MBT). The latter, the hymn of twelve verses, is said to have been uttered by Bhairava after his consort, the supreme goddess of the Paścimāmnāya, emerged from the Liṅga and initiated him into the tradition. All these stava-s have deep connections to the mantra-s of the Paścimāmnāya. The Daṇḍaka provides the pada-s for the elaborate pada-mālā-mantra of Kubjikā that is provided in full with the bīja-s in the MBT. The Dvādaśa-śloka mimics the number of syllables and the invocation of Kubjikā in the eponymous mantra of ![12 \\times 32](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=12+%5Ctimes+32&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) syllables that is provided by both the Kubjikāmata-tantra and the MBT. This mantra is said to form part of the mantra-tanu of the goddess (specifically the mekhala) described in several Paścimāmnāya tantra-s and is said to emerge from the 50 Rudra-s of the āmnāya. Below we provide the Dvādaśa-śloka along with some notes.

aiṃkārāsanam ārūḍhāṃ vajra-padmopari-sthitām ।  
siddhiṃ māṃ dadate nityaṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 1 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, stationed above the vajra and lotus, seated on the throne of the bījā aīṃ, who constantly gives me success.

\* The goddess is addressed throughout this śloka as Kujā, which appears to be a syncope for Kubjikā.  
\* The bījā aīṃ, or the Vāgbhava-kūṭa is the bīja of the goddess Parā from the Pūrvāmnāya and is also the first bīja of the Tripuraśekhara-mantra (Bālā) of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya. This indicates the link to the Pūrvāmnāya.  
\* The vajra and the lotus are a special feature of the mantra-throne of Kubjikā.

jñānaśaktiṃ mahāmāyāṃ divya-jñāna-prakāśakīm ।  
antardhāna-gatāṃ devīṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 2 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, the power of knowledge, the great deluderess, the divine illuminatrix, the goddess who has become invisible.

\* Her vanishing is a reference to her absorbing the universe into the form of a liṅga and disappearing.

catuḥpīṭhaka-madhyasthāṃ divya-śakti-pradbhāvataḥ ।  
ṣaṭ-prakāra-samopetāṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 3 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, stationed in the midst of the four sacred seats by the power of her divine energy, who is furnished with six varieties.

\* The 4 sacred seats: Oḍḍiyāna, Jālandhara, Kāmarūpa and Pūrṇagiri.  
\* The six varieties: Evidently, a reference to the six-fold formulation of her yantra inscribed with mantra-syllables derived from the Dvādaśa-śloka-mantra

menākhya-duhitā devī turyasthāne vyavasthitā ।  
liñgānte vasate nityaṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 4 ॥  
The goddess, the daughter of Menā, abides in the fourth station. I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, ever residing within the Liṅga.

\* The Liṅga: Udyāna-bhairava: the form the goddess takes on the holy rock in Candradvīpa. As the daughter of Menā, i.e., Haimavatī in this tradition, she is known as Bhadrakālikā, giving a link to the Uttarāmnāya.

bāla-krama-samopetāṃ bhagāhlādena ciñciṇīm ।  
nādiphāntā+asvarā+aghorāṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 5 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, endowed with the “Transmission of the Boy”, ciñciṇī, worshiped through the pleasure of the bhaga, the benign one, who is Mālinī (nādiphāntā) and silence (asvarā)

\* bāla-krama: A likely allusion to the Kula teachings promulgated by the Boy, i.e., Skanda-Vaṭuka. This bāla-krama is also mentioned in the opening of the hymn to the Śrikrama found in the opening of the Vārāhī-tantra. The Kaula teachings of that tantra, while partly affiliated with the Paścimāmnāya, also encompass Vārāhī.  
\* bhagāhlāda: An allusion to the sexual kaula ritual.  
\* nādiphāntā: the famed Mālinī maṇḍala of phonemes. This is directly derived from the Pūrvāmnāya, where this maṇḍala is central. Malinī is the form of the goddess worshiped along with Śabdarāśi-bhairava in the Pūrvāmnāya’s Mālinīvijaya-tantra.

candradvīpe śilā śuddhā pūjitā ca mayā purā ।  
sapta-janma-viniṣkrāntāṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 6 ॥  
\[She is\], in Candradvīpa, the pure rock formerly worshiped by me. I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, who, after seven births, has emerged from it.

\* Candradvīpa: The island where the goddess is said to have gone and stationed herself on the pure rock, assuming the form of the Liṅga. That rock is described as being in the form of a tetrahedron (śṛṅgāṭakākāra). She was invoked in that form by her consort Navātman-bhairava.

ghorāṃ ghoratarāghorāghora-jñānāvalambinīm  
nitya-yuktāṃ svacakrasthāṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 7 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, she who is Ghorā, Ghoratarā and Aghorā, who is upheld by the knowledge of Aghora, constantly yoked to \[Śiva\] and stationed in her own cakra.

\* This verse indicates the clear links of the Kulāmnāya-s to the substratum of the Bhairava-srotas. The root brahma-mantra of this srotas from which the three types of śakti-s emerge is clearly laid out. It is also an allusion to Svacchanda-bhairava who is the linking emanation between the Bahurūpī-ṛk and deities of the Paścimāmnāya.  
\* The svacakra is the Khacakra or the Saṃvartāmaṇḍala of Kubjikā.

janma-trikoṇa-madhyasthāṃ taruṇāditya-varcasām ।  
divyām ājñāsvarūpeṇa śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 8 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, stationed in the midst of the triangle of birth (yoni-maṇḍala), with the luster of the rising sun, who is divine as the command \[of the Bhairava\].

\* This verse contains a clear allusion to the central triangle of the complex Kubjikā-yantra (the yoni triangle).

rudraśaktiḥ sadāpūjyā pīṭhānāṃ kīrtanād api ।  
siddhiṃ sphuṭāṃ pradātārīṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 9 ॥  
She is constantly worshiped as the Śakti of Rudra and also through the praise of the sacred seats (the four pīṭha-s). I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, who bestows visible accomplishment.

\* The goddess is called Rudraśakti, signaling her to be essentially an ectype of the Vedic Rudra at the root of the Śaiva-śāsana.

devataiḥ pūjitāṃ nityaṃ brahmacarya-parāyaṇaiḥ ।  
siddhayogeśvarī-khyātāṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 10 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, constantly worshiped by the deities and those practicing sacred studentship, who is known as Siddhayogeśvarī.

\* Here, she is identified with Siddhayogeśvarī, the deity of one of the root tantra-s of the Pūrvāmnāya, Siddhayogeśvarī-mata.

siddha-vidyādharair-yakṣair-yoginī-gaṇa-vṛndakaiḥ ।  
vādya-nṛtya-ratāṃ devīṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 11 ॥  
I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, together with the groups of siddha-s, vidyādhara-s, yakṣa-s and the yoginī hosts, the delighteress in music and dance.

bharitāṃ bhairavīm ugrāṃ amānta-pada-gāminīm ।  
mitramātaḥ prabhuṃ devīṃ śrīkujākhyāṃ namāmy aham ॥ 12 ॥  
O mother of Mitra, I salute the auspicious one known as Kujā, filling the lord, the fierce Bhairavī proceeding to station at the end of the New Moon.

\* Mitra, the ancient Āditya class god, is “Rudraized” as a [Bhairava in the Paścimāmnāya](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2023/01/03/the-vyomavyapin-in-the-pasupata-tantra-and-a-discursion-on-nine-fold-rudra-mantra-s/) and is also seen as the first nātha of the system (Mitranātha) who composed the Mālinīstava.  
\* The allusion to the “filling” Bhairavī reminds one of Abhinavagupta’s comparable phrase (bharita-tanuḥ) in his account of the Trika system.
