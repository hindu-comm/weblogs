The Uttarāmnāya and the Trailokya-mohana-kavaca

![kAlI17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali17.jpg)A “depiction’’ of the deity of the Uttarāmnāya manifesting in viyat-pada during the 17-fold meditation

yugapad yānti yatra+āśu sāmarasyaṃ viyatpade ।  
nistaraṅge nirābhāse pare saptadaśābhidhe ॥  
Simultaneously they \[the rays\] swiftly attain the state of oneness in the vacuum state, which  
becomes free of waves and free of radiance, the supreme 17-fold wheel.

itthaṃ visphārayanti+idaṃ yoginī-cakram uttamam ।  
saṃhārabhakṣiṇī devī bhāti saptadaśātmataḥ ॥  
Thus, it vibrates, this best cakra of the yoginī-s  
\[and\] the goddess Saṃhārabhakṣiṇī manifests as the 17-fold one.  
-Arṇasiṃha

According to the Ciñciṇī-mata-sāra-samuccaya (CMSS), the Uttarāmnāya was taught at Śrīśailam by the siddha Niṣkriyānandanātha to his student Vidyānandanatha, who despite looking like a tribesman, was the son of the brāhmaṇa Śīlāciti. Tradition holds that this system was originally promulgated by the irascible Ātreya, Krodhamuni Durvāsas. It was then transmitted via a line of female practitioners before finally being made manifest by Niṣkriyānandanātha. He saw the devotion of Vidyānandanatha, who was worshiping the deity in the cemetery near Śrīśailam and taught him the practice. The simplest form of this teaching might be seen as the basal version of this lineage of the Kālī tradition and is known as the Mata. It is focused on the circle of 12 Kālī-s and the central deity of the āmnāya (12+1=13), Bhānavīkaulinī (also called Kumārī) rising in the kha-vyoman (viyat-pada). A variant of the Mata was that centered on three goddesses (paralleling the Pūrvāmnāya) Trailokyaḍāmarā (potentially rooted in the more ancient Ḍāmara-tantra-s), Matacakreśvarī and Ghoraghoratarā.

A more yoga-focussed evolute of the Mata was the Krama (further described as Mahānaya or Mahārtha), which tradition holds to have emerged at Oḍḍiyāna, the sacred seat in the North. Versions of the Krama had different sequences of worship, with the 12+1 Kālī-s of the underlying Mata incorporated as the sequence known as the Kālīkrama. One version of the Krama also incorporated the worship of the 64 Śākinī-s (=Yoginī-s). A further version of the Krama features a sequence of (16+1) 17 Kālī-s in place of the ancestral 13, with a corresponding set of 68 Yoginī-s in tetrads of 17 (e.g., Paramapaṇḍita Kulācārya Arṇasiṃha’s Kha-cakra-pañcaka-stotra and Mahānayaprakāśa). It is possible that this number emerged via an early influence of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya’s 16 Nityā system. It is not clear if the Krama developed at Oḍḍiyāna was transmitted back to South India or if the southern branch of the Mahānaya branch directly sprung from an early evolute of the Mata that was a common ancestor to both it and the Oḍḍiyāna transmission. In any case, the Southern transmission (e.g., that typified by the teaching of Maheśvarānandanātha), too, spread widely through the Indosphere. Notably, it incorporated special chomma-associated words for each of its 5 krama-s from a Dravidian language close to both Tamil and Kannada (has Kannada’s pa\>ha and likely from the Draviḍa-Karṇāṭa borderlands).

Early on, the Uttarāmnāya developed a parallel set of arborizations that engulfed the Pūrvāmnāya. Here, Kālī emerged as the culmination of the krama of the triad of Trika goddesses, Parā, Parāparā and Aparā. In this form, several Kālī-yāga-s are taught wherein she takes the form of 1. Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī (Mahācaṇḍayogeśvarī); 2. Śūleśvarī; 3. Mahāparā; 4. Uttarakālī; 5. Triśīrṣā (mirroring the Bhairava Triśirobhairava also seen in the underlying Trika; hence, she is also called Bhairavānanā). In parallel, the expanding Uttarāmnāya, also absorbed the Śiraścheda-tantra of the Vāma-srotas and developed into the expansive “King of the Tantra-s’’, the Jayadratha-yāmala with several distinct Kālī-yāga-s. This tantra features versions of the Krama and the Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī yāga-s and also a distinct type of Krama differing from the Krama, Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī and Trika-based yāga-s. This is centered on the ferocious, six-headed Vīryakālī, seated on the shoulders of Kālāgni-rudra, who is a Nīlalohita-rudra. A further variant in the Jayadrathayāmala was the Pāñcarātra-influenced worship of a Kālī as the consort of Viṣṇu known as Mādhaveśvarī.

The Uttarāmnāya also intersected with the Paścimāmnāya in multiple ways. One of these is captured in the gāyatrī bringing together Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī and Kubjikā as Siddhilakṣmī:

OṂ caṇḍa-kāpālinyai vidmahe kālasaṃkarṣaṇyai dhīmahī । tannaḥ siddhilakṣmīḥ pracodayāt ॥

In its first foot, this gāyatrī further brings in the goddess Caṇḍakāpālinī (the consort of Kapālīśa-bhairava), the deity of the Brahmayāmala-tantra with functional similarities with Kālī. Caṇḍakāpālinī’s deep Śaiva roots are indicated by her worship even in the Siddhānta as specified by her mantra in the Kālottara-tantra of that tradition. The Uttarāmnāya absorbed a key goddess of Paścimāmnāya, Tvaritā. This spawned the Pāñcarātra-influenced Krama, where Tvaritā appears as the Kālī consort of Nṛsiṃha who has taken the place of the Bhairava. Conversely, as a result of the Uttarāmnāya’s influence on Paścimāmnāya, in the Kubjikāmata-tantra Tvaritā came to be identified as time goddess congruent to Kālī, being associated with the quantum of time and the unit of the vibration (panda). Further, the anastomosis of the Uttarāmnāya and the Paścimāmnāya led to the augmentation of the goddess Pratyaṅgirā. This is seen in the compendium known as the Tridaśa-ḍāmarā-pratyaṅgirā-tantra, which collects material from multiple older Uttarāmnāya and Paścimāmnāya texts. Here the identification of Kālī, Kubjikā and Pratyaṅgirā is made explicit by the famous anuṣṭubh:

karavīra-śmaśāna-sthāṃ kālasaṃkarṣaṇīṃ śivām ।  
caṇḍāṃ pratyaṅgirāṃ kālīṃ siddhilakṣmīm namāmy aham ॥  
I salute the \[goddess\] stationed at the cemetery of Karavīra (at Oḍḍiyāna), \[who is\] the auspicious Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī (the goddess of the Jayadrathayāmala), the terrible Pratyaṅgirā, Kālī and Siddhilakṣmī (Kubjikā). The variant parām for śivām found in Vārāhī tantra could also signal the Pūrvāmnāya goddess.

Pratyaṅgirā also came to be identified with Tvaritā completing the circle. Further, the Śakti-s corresponding to each of the 32 syllables of the mantra of Kubjikā with that syllabic count are ferocious Kālī-s forming the āvaraṇa of the central deity of the Paścimāmnāya.

A later evolute of the Mata was the system of Guhyakālī taught in tantra-s like the Hāhārāva (which affiliates itself with the Atharvan tradition) and the large tantra, the Mahākāla-saṃhitā (MKS) with two core sections called Khaṇḍa-s. While later evolutes, the Guhyakālī tantra-s contain several fragments of ancient material, for instance, old Rudra mantra-s in the Hāhārāva from the Ḍāmara-tantra-s (e.g., the mantra: OṂ namo bhagavate rudrāya uḍḍāmareśvarāya sarva-duṣṭān me niṣūdayā śaniṃ nāśaya bhaṃjaya svāhā ।). The Hāhārāva also includes the teachings pertaining to the Uttarāmnāya worship of the goddess Pratyaṅgirā (e.g., Chapter 2 of Hāhārāva and the mantra of Pratyaṅgirā with the 8 Mātṛ-s). However, the focus of this system is the goddess Guhyakālī who is worshiped in two primary forms. Her first form combines the 3 goddesses of the Mata, Trailokyaḍāmarā, Matacakreśvarī and Ghoraghoratarā, into a single 3-headed 8-handed form with the central head being worshiped as Matalakṣmī. Her second, more elaborate form is a zoocephalic one with 10 heads: 1. human; 2. lion; 3. Leopard; 4. jackal; 5. bear; 6. monkey; 7. eagle; 8. crocodile 9. elephant; 10. Horse, with 8 to 54 arms. Her consort may be either Bhairava or Nṛsiṃha as a continuation of Mādhaveśvarī of the Jayadratha-yāmala.

The final evolute of this system emerged through an anastomosis of the Guhyakālī system with the Dakṣiṇāmnāya (Śrīkula), resulting in Kāma-kalā-kālī taught in the second part (Kāmakalā Khaṇḍa) of the MKS. A separate late intersection with the Dakṣiṇāmnāya and the older Kālī tradition gave rise to the Dakṣiṇakālikā system. The Kāmakalā Khaṇḍa of the MKS teaches the famed mantra-kavaca of Kāmakalākālī known as the Trailokya-mohana-kavaca (TMK), which was deployed for the destruction of enemies and conquest of a kingdom. It is notable in: 1. Combining the invocation of both Kāmakalākālī and Guhyakālī. 2. Featuring a total of 34 Kālī-s, amounting to two sequences of 17 – a number inherited from the old 17-fold Krama. 3. These Kālī-s feature both erotic (E) and fierce (F) versions, thereby combining the character of both the Dakṣiṇāmnāya and the Uttarāmnāya. Below is the list of the 34, with their character marked E, F and B (benign):  
1. Madanāturā (E); 2. Karālinī (F); 3. Caṇḍanāyikā (F); 4. Jagadambikā (B); 5. Sureśvarī (B); 6. Śmaśāninī (F); 7. Pramāthinī (F); 8. Bhagākulā (E); 9. Ratipriyā (E); 10. Kālikā (F); 11. Ratākulā (E); 12. Maheśvarī (B); 13. Bhagapriyā (E); 14. Mahājaṭā (F); 15. Madanamālinī (E); 16. Raktāsavonmādā (F); 17. Nidhuvanapriyā (E); 18. Muṇḍāvataṃsikā (F); 19. Phetkāra-rāviṇī (F); 20. Naravāhinī (F); 21. Saṃhāra-rūpiṇī (F); 22. Siddhi-karālinī (F); 23. Nirvāṇadāyinī (B); 24. Jñāna-prakāśinī (B); 25. Nṛmuṇḍa-mālinī (F); 26. Vijayadāyinī (F); 27. Mahiṣamardinī (F); 28. Mṛtyu-vināśinī (B); 29. Saṃsāratāriṇī (B); 30. Guhyakālī (F); 31. Ghora-cāmuṇḍā (F); 32. Bhadrakālī (F); 33. Karāla-daśanā (F); 34. Kāmakalā-kālī (E);

A total of 7 benign, 8 erotic and 19 fierce goddesses. The TMK is suffused with bīja-s but rendered in the form of “pseudo-anuṣtubh-s’’ barring one verse in the form of a “pseudo-gāyatrī’’.
