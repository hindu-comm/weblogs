Some notes on the Haṃsa in mantra traditions crisscrossing the Smārta-Śaiva interface

The haṃsa (the divine swan/gander) is identified across Hindu mantra traditions with the breath cycle. While this mantra is vocalized as so.ahaṃ haṃsaḥ । (the haṃsa mantra), it is also identified with the very process of breathing, with the two pada-s respectively constituting the inhalation and the exhalation of a single cycle. Thus, the very act of breathing is the repetition of this mantra; hence, it is known as the ajapa-mantra or the ajapā gāyatrī, i.e., the unvocalized mantra. As we have noted before, the deity of this mantra, the gander, [was identified with Rudra and his lineage-specific ectypes from early in the śaiva tradition](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/the-pashupata-brahmopanishat-pashupata-brahma-brahmano-upanishad-pbu/). The mantra was also seen as a conjunction of Rudra with his śakti, with the so.aham corresponding to the śakti and the haṃsaḥ corresponding to Rudra. The divine gander, haṃsa, has ancient roots in the Veda itself, going back to the Ṛgveda. In that regard, we had earlier noted its use as a metaphor for the solar Vasu god (Sūrya in the Anukramaṇi) in the [famous mantra of Vāmadeva Gautama](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/the-pashupata-brahmopanishat-pashupata-brahma-brahmano-upanishad-pbu/) (RV 4.40.5), which finds a special place in the śrauta ritual. Similarly, in the Atharvaveda, the haṃsa is identified with the Āditya Vivasvān in a tṛca (AV-vulgate 10.8.17-19) with philosophical content foreshadowing the later expositions of haṃsa in the śaiva and śaiva-influenced traditions:

ye arvāṅ madhya uta vā purāṇaṃ  
vedaṃ vidvāṃsam abhito vadanti ।  
ādityam +eva+ te pari vadanti sarve  
agniṃ dvitīyaṃ trivṛtaṃ ca haṃsam ॥

Those who recently, in mid-times, or anciently  
from up close addressed the knower of the Veda,  
they all comprehensively addressed the Āditya only  
the second Agni, the threefold haṃsa.

sahasrāhṇyaṃ viyatāv asya pakṣau  
harer haṃsasya patataḥ s(u)vargam ।  
sa devānt sarvān urasy upadadya  
saṃpaśyan yāti bhuvanāni viśvā ॥

Over a thousand days \[flying\] in space, \[by\] its two wings,  
was the golden gander’s flight to heaven.  
He holding all the gods in his chest  
travels his way, beholding all the worlds.

satyena+urdhvas tapati  
brahmaṇārvāṅ vi paśyati ।  
prāṇena tiryaṅ prāṇati  
yasmin jyeṣṭham adhi śritam ॥19॥ AV-vulgate 10.8.17-19

By truth, he blazes upwards,  
By the Brahman \[power\], he looks below,  
With breath, he breathes sideways,  
in whom the foremost is established.

In these mantra-s, the identification of the haṃsa with the universal consciousness is already implicit, as is his connection with the breath (prāṇa). These aspects were to receive considerable augmentation in the śaiva tradition. Based on an analysis of the Pāśupata-brāhmaṇopaniṣad, we had earlier proposed that this ancient tradition of the haṃsa was incorporated early into the śaiva-tradition. Perhaps as a conduit for this, we find that the Rudrian deities (Rudra, Bhava, Śarva, Marut-s and Aśvin-s) are metaphorically referred to as or associated with geese in the Ṛgveda and the Atharvaveda:  
Marut-s:  
ā haṃsāso na svasarāṇi gantana  
madhor madāya marutaḥ samanyavaḥ ॥ RV 2.34.5cd

Invocation of Rudra, Bhava, Śarva:  
tubhyam āraṇyāḥ paśavo mṛgā vane  
hitā haṃsāḥ suparṇāḥ śakunā vayāṃsi । AV-vulgate 11.2.24ab

The tradition of the haṃsa mantra was inherited by the śaiva-mantra-mārga from the atimārga and found several expressions often interacting with the Smārta tradition that had also inherited the same concept from its Vaidika roots. While this note is by no means intended as a detailed account of haṃsa in the śaiva tradition, we meander below through some expressions in different lineages.

**Haṃsa in the pañcāṅga-nyāsa**

![haMsa_sadAshiva](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hamsa_sadashiva.jpg)  
The pañcāṅga-nyāsa of Rudra using the 5 vaktra-mantra-s as practiced by the smārta-s shows influences of the Saiddhāntika tradition. It culminates in the Haṃsopāsana of Rudra-sadāśiva, prior to which the haṃsa is identified with the Īśāna face (the emanator of the Siddhānta scriptures) of Sadāśiva:  
1. sadyojātam+ pādābhyāṃ namaḥ ।  
2. vāmadevāya+ ūrūbhyāṃ namaḥ ।  
3. aghorebhyo’tha +hṛdayāya namaḥ ।  
4. tatpuruṣāya + mukhāya namaḥ ।  
5. īśānaḥ saravidyānām + haṃsa-haṃsa mūrdhne namaḥ ।

6\. This is followed by the karāṅga-nyāsa-s and dhyāna for the japa of the Haṃsa-gāyatrī:  
haṃsa-haṃsāya vidmahe paramahaṃsāya dhīmahi । tan no haṃsaḥ pracodayāt ॥  
7. This is followed by the identification of Haṃsa with Sadāśiva, the supreme deity of the Siddhānta:  
haṃsa haṃseti yo brūyād dhaṃso nāma sadāśivaḥ ।

**The kaula-inspired prāṇapratiṣṭha**

![anumati](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/anumati.jpg)

The purely Vaidika prāṇapratiṣṭhā is performed using the below triṣṭubh mantra of the Gaupāyana-s invoking the lunar goddess Anumati Asunīti:

asunīte punar asmāsu cakṣuḥ  
punaḥ prāṇam iha no dhehi bhogam ।  
jyok paśyema sūryam uccarantam  
anumate mṛḻayā naḥ svasti ॥ RV 10.59.6

O Asunīti (leader of life breath) \[give\] us our sight again,  
give us again our breath and our enjoyment,  
long may we see the Sun rising up,  
o Anumati grant us mercy and wellbeing.

However, most Smārta practitioners combine it with a tāntrika-vidhi with roots in the kaula tradition that invokes a version of the ultimately Pūrvāmnāya goddess Parā as the Prāṇa-śakti in conjunction with the dyad of ectypes of Rudra and his śakti, Haṃsānandanātha and Haṃsāmbā. The deity of the rite Parā Prāṇa-śakti is identified with Anumati of the above ṛk. It goes thus:

amukasya prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā mahāmantrasya brahmā-viṣṇu-maheśvarā ṛṣyaḥ । ṛg-yajus-sāmātharvāṇi chandāṃsi । sakala-jagat-sṛṣṭi-sthiti-saṃhāra-kāriṇī prāṇa-śaktiḥ parā devatā । āṃ bījam । hrīṃ śaktiḥ । kroṃ kīlakam । amukasya prāṇa-pratiṣṭhārthe jape viniyogaḥ ॥

The aṅganyāsa and karanyāsa are performed with the bīja-s: āṃ, hrīṃ, kroṃ, āṃ, hrīṃ, kroṃ; bhūr-bhuvaḥ svarom iti digbandhaḥ ।; The deity is visualized thus:  
dhyānam  
raktāmbodhi-stha-potollasad-aruṇa-sarojādhi-rūḍhā karābjaiḥ  
pāśaṃ kodaṇḍam ikṣūdbhavam aliguṇaṃ apy aṅkuśam pañcabāṇān ।  
bibhrāṇā sṛk-kapālaṃ tri-nayana-lasitā pīna-vakṣoruhāḍyā  
devī bālārkavarṇā bhavatu sukhakarī prāṇa-śaktiḥ parā naḥ ॥

Mounted on a brilliant crimson lotus on a boat stationed in the sea of blood, with her lotus hands,  
holding a lasso, a bow made of sugarcane with a string of bees, and also a hook and five arrows,  
holding a blood-filled skull cup, sporting three eyes with her full breasts enhancing her form,  
May that goddess of the life force, with the complexion of the rising sun, bring us happiness.

pañcopacāra-pujā

Then the tāntrika mantra-s are deployed with the sampuṭikaraṇa of the haṃsa-mantra followed by the Anumati ṛk of the Gaupāyana-s:

āṃ hrīṃ kroṃ kroṃ hrīṃ āṃ ya-ra-la-va-śa-ṣa-sa-hoṃ । kśaṃ haṃsaḥ sohaṃ sohaṃ haṃsaḥ । amukasya prāṇā iha prāṇāḥ ॥  
āṃ hrīṃ kroṃ kroṃ hrīṃ āṃ ya-ra-la-va-śa-ṣa-sa-hoṃ । kśaṃ haṃsaḥ sohaṃ sohaṃ haṃsaḥ । amukasya jīva iha sthitaḥ ॥  
āṃ hrīṃ kroṃ kroṃ hrīṃ āṃ ya-ra-la-va-śa-ṣa-sa-hoṃ । kśaṃ haṃsaḥ sohaṃ sohaṃ haṃsaḥ । amukasya sarvendriyāṇi vāṅ manaś cakṣu-śrotra-jihvā-ghrāṇa-prāṇāpāna-vyānodāna-samānā ihaivāgatya ihaivāsmin kumbha/asyām pratimāyām sukhaṃ ciraṃ tiṣṭhantu svāhā ॥

Anumati ṛk

The deity whose prāṇa is being established is then addressed:  
āvahito bhava । sthāpito bhava । san-nihito bhava । san-niruddho bhava । avakuṇṭhito bhava suprīto bhava । suprasanno bhava। varado bhava । prasīda prasīda । svāmin sarva-jagannātha yāvat pūjāvasānakam । tavat tvam prīti-bhāvena kumbhe asmin/pratimāyām asyām san-nidhiṃ kuru । amukasya prāṇān pratiṣṭhāpayāmi ॥

The presentation and iconography of the goddess in this rite have some unusual but telling features. She being called Parā and associated with the “life-force’’ is reminiscent of Parā-sādhanā-s of the type known as Mṛtyuñjaya-parā or Mṛtasaṃjīvanī-parā, which are first mentioned in the Siddhayogeśvarī-mata of the Pūrvāmnāya (Trika) tradition. These versions of Parā are also associated with the Dakṣiṇāmnāya goddess Tripurasundarī in the Dakṣiṇāmūrti-saṃhitā. In line with the latter, while she is called Parā in the prāṇapratiṣṭhā-vidhi, her iconography is distinctly similar to that of Tripurasundarī, with the crimson complexion, the sugarcane bow, five arrows, the lasso and the hook, rather than Parā. However, it departs from Tripurasundarī in depicting a blood-filled skull cup that is more in line with a Kālīkula or Paścimāmnāya goddess or the two fierce goddesses Parāparā and Aparā of the Pūrvāmnāya tradition. Remarkably, a comparable iconography for Kubjikā, combining Pūrvāmnāya and Dakṣiṇāmnāya features, is described in the Nepalian manuscript of the Paścimāmnāya tantra, the Kularatnoddyota. Here, she is said to have five heads (as the [Rudra-śakti](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2025/01/02/the-dvadasa-sloka-of-the-pascimamnaya/)) and ten arms holding mudras of abhaya, varada, jñāna, a book, a rosary, a lasso, a hook, a bow, five arrows, and a skull cup filled with wine. Thus, the Kularatnoddyota transparently fuses Parā and Tripurā to give rise to a visualization of a form of Kubjikā. What is different from the Kularatnoddyota dhyāna(apart from the five heads) in our dhyāna of the Prāṇa-śakti called Parā is, ironically, the Parā-like features. Another important feature of the above practice linking the Prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā goddess to Pūrvāmnāya and Dakṣiṇāmnāya is the sampuṭikaraṇa with the haṃsa-mantra in the deployment. This leads us next to briefly examine the key place of the haṃsa-mantra in those traditions.

**Eighteen and the haṃsa of the Paścimāmnāya and allied texts**  
The “origin mythology’’ of the Paścimāmnāya presents the absorption of the universe by the goddess Kubjikā and her assuming the form a liṅga known as [Udyāna-bhairava in Candradvīpa](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/the-pauranic-element-of-the-pashchimamnaya/). Śiva then invokes her to emerge from it and then calls upon her to teach him the āmnāya. In the course of these events, he is presented in the primary tantra-s of this tradition as praising her with [metrical or prose stava-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2025/01/02/the-dvadasa-sloka-of-the-pascimamnaya/). One of the themes in those stava-s is the role of Kubjikā in awakening the haṃsa, which evidently implies the Bhairava manifesting as the prāṇa. One such example is seen in the Manthāna-bhairava-tantra (MBT):

unmanābhāvātītāpy aṣṭādaśānta-saṃsthite ॥  
śāmbhavī śambhu-sambodhinī tvam ॥  
mahecchā-kriyā-jñāne ṛjvī rekhinī kuṇḍalī vāmā-samjñā-jagad-raudrī jyeṣṭhā śivā tvam anākhyāmbikā unmanātīta-bhāvaugha-pada-saṃsthitā ॥  
sukṣma-rūpā sutejārdha-candrākṛtis tvam trikoṇāvṛtā madhyagā tvaṃ tri-rekhāṅga-sambhūtā saṃpūrṇā madhyapīṭhasthitā ॥  
kubjī tvam mālinī hamsa-saṃbodhanī tvaṃ gata randhre śiva-tattva-pīyūṣa-dhārānta-saṃsiktā ॥

O you who are verily beyond the state of the raging mind stationed at the end of the Eighteen!  
You are Śāmbhavī who awakens Śambhu.  
O you who are the great \[śakti-s\] of will, action and knowledge, the straight line (the constituent of the triangle of the yantra signifying the 3 shakti-s), the snake-like one (Kuṇdalini śakti), the one known as Vāmā; Raudri of the universe, the auspicious Jyeṣṭhā; you are called Ambikā; You are stationed beyond the series of states transcending the raging mind.  
You are of subtle form; you are of the form of the half-moon emitting good light; you are surrounded by triangles \[and\] stationed in the center; you emerge from the figure of the three lines; you are complete and reside in the central sacred seat.  
O Kubjī, you are Mālinī who awakens the gander (haṃsa). When you enter the \[brahma\] aperture (cranial fontanelle), you are sprinkled internally by the stream of nectar of the Śiva principle.

Here, the goddess Kubjikā is identified with several śakti-s of the greater śaiva tradition. First, she is identified with the Kuṇdalini, who personifies the central yoga process of the system. Then she is equated to Vāmā, Raudri and Jyeṣṭhā, who emanate from the Vāmadeva mantra and are prominent across the Śaiva-mantra-mārga to represent functional tripartition. Finally, she is identified with the Trika goddess Mālinī and, in that capacity, is said to awaken the haṃsa.

The peculiar number eighteen alluded to at the beginning of the above prose stuti has an intimate connection to the haṃsa and links it to the 4 piṭha-s, or sacred seats of the goddess found across the Indian subcontinent. They are 1. Oḍḍiyāna, which is typically associated with the North (barring Lokesh Chandra’s proposal, which we believe is not in accordance with most of the evidence). Many workers tend to associate it with a place in Suvastu or its vicinity. 2. Jālandhara: this is associated with the city of Jalandhar in the Panjab, and there is an extant (though secondarily consecrated) śaktī-pīṭha temple at this site. 3. Kāmarūpa: This is the eastern pīṭha associated with the extant Kāmarūpa shrine (Assam) extensively described in the Kālikā-purāṇa. 4. Pūrṇagiri: Today, this pīṭha is associated with the Tanakpur Mandir, Uttarakhand. However, it is clear that this is a secondary location of the original franchise. The MBT is emphatic in stating that Pūrṇagiri is in Dakṣiṇāpatha-maṇḍala and was likely on the Sahya mountains rimming the west coast of Maharashtra/Goa.

The connection between 18 and the pīṭha-s is expounded thus in the MBT:

catuṣ-pīṭha-vibhedena akārādi-catuṣṭayam ।  
haṃsa-yuktena kartavyam etat pīṭha-catuṣṭayam ॥  
catuṣpīṭhāṇi yāni catuṣkāni catus tathā ।  
padāni ṣoḍaśa hy evaṃ granthiś caiva sa-ha+akṣarau ॥  
svarair yuktau prakartavyau kalārūpeṇa śabdati ।  
kalāḥ pratipadādau tu udayo ‘staś ca atra vai ॥  
tithy ādyāś ca padaṃ yānti praveśaṃ vāmam ucyate ।  
dakṣiṇaṃ caiva niṣkāśaṃ candra-sūrya-vibhāgaśaḥ ॥  
niṣkāśe maraṇam jñeyam praveśe caiva jīvitam ।  
padaiḥ ṣoḍaśabhiś caite niśkāśaṃ ca praveśakam ॥  
yo jānāti prayatnena sa yogī yoga-vedakaḥ ।  
o-jā-pū-kā pṛthivyādi vyoma-yonis tu pañcami ।  
kūṭa-bhede parijñāte haṃsa-devaṃ niyojayet ॥  
sa pumān kālahantā ca nānyathā vīravandite ।  
yathā pīṭha-nāmākṣarasyaiva ekaikasya catuṣ catuḥ ॥  
pīṭhabhedena granthis tu haṃsa-bījodayaṃ vidhuḥ । Ṣaṭ-sāhasra-saṃhitā (SSS) 27.14-22

The four sacred seats correspond to the four groups \[of four vowels\] starting with ‘a’. One should yoke this group of four seats with haṃsa (so.ahaṃ haṃsaḥ ।). The four sacred seats, which are a tetrad of tetrads, are the sixteen divisions of this, and the knot is indeed the syllables ‘sa’ and ‘ha’ (total of 18). (These) two (sa and ha) should be combined to the vowels; \[thus,\] it resounds in the form of the \[lunar\] digits: the digits in the first lunar day and also those that are in the waxing and waning cycles. The lunar days, starting from the first, attain the configuration with the entrance on the left. The exit is on the right, marking the divisions of the Moon and Sun (corresponding to the mapping of the cycle of breath on the lunar cycle). Death is known to reside in the exit, and life is in the entry. These sixteen parts (the vowels and the corresponding kalā-s) \[define\] the exit and entry \[paths\]. He who knows this through effort is the yogin who knows yoga. \[The sacred seats\] o-jā-pū-kā (Oḍḍiyāna, Jālandhara, Pūrṇagiri and Kāmarūpa) are pṛthivī etc (pṛthivī, jala, agni, vāyu) and the space, the source (yoni) is the fifth… Once he knows of the distinctions of the kūṭa-s (mantra divisions), he may deploy \[the incantation of\] the god Haṃsa. That man is the destroyer of time and none else, o goddess praised by the heroes. There are four vowels for each syllable of the four names of \[each\] sacred seat. The divisions of the sacred seats and the knot are known as the rising of the haṃsa-bīja.

Here, the SSS describes a sampuṭikaraṇa of the Haṃsa mantra with that of svara-s (vowels), which are mapped as tetrads onto the four pīṭha-s. In turn, the vowels are associated with the lunar cycle in the form of kalā-s, completing the connection to the ancient lunar goddesses. The path of the moon and the sun, defined by the ecliptic, is divided by the equatorial plane into the upper/left path (northern path) associated with life and the lower/right (southern) path associated with death (c.f., Vedic Deva-nakṣatra-s and Yama-nakṣatra-s). This, then, is homologized with the breath cycle denoted by the haṃsa-mantra. Knots or the junctions of these cycles are specifically marked by the syllables of that mantra.

The Paścimāmnāya tantra-s and the Dakṣināmnāya traditions inspired by it (e.g., Saundaryalaharī) present a further connection between the haṃsa-mantra and the number 18 in a scriptural context. Both the Paścimāmnāya tantra-s and the Dakṣināmnāya are united by the emergence of the ṣaṭ-cakra system coupled with the Kuṇḍalinī-krama. As the goddess of the āmnāya in the form of Kuṇḍalinī rises from her resting state to the thousand-petalled station of the Sahasrāra, she is meditated upon in each of the six cakra-s in her path (the kula-patha), starting from the Mūlādhāra, in different forms along with corresponding forms of her consort Śiva. When she reaches the Anāhata (the 4th cakra, at the level of the heart), they are meditated upon as (Parama-)haṃsānandanātha and (Parama-)haṃseśvarī, as if they are sporting in the Mānasa lake before Kailāsa. Mānasa is also metaphorically taken to be the mind which may be understood as the sādhaka’s own mind or the great “Übermind’’. The mantra of Śiva as Hamsa is given as haṃsaḥ sohaṃ svāhā । and that of the Śakti as Haṃsāṃbā is given as sohaṃ haṃsaḥ svāhā । As the goddess of a Himalayan setting, Haṃsāṃbā has a focal cult in Kashmir as Bhīḍā Bhagavatī. These deities are praised in the 38th verse of the Saundaryalaharī:

samunmīlat-saṃvit-kamala-makarandaika-rasikaṃ  
bhaje haṃsa-dvandvaṃ kim api mahatāṃ mānasa-caram ।  
yad ālāpād aṣṭādaśa-guṇita-vidyā pariṇatir  
yad ādatte doṣād guṇam akhilam adbhyaḥ paya iva ॥

Delighting in the pollen of the blooming lotus of consciousness,  
I worship that couple of swans, why indeed, waddling in the great minds (the great Mānasa lake);  
from whose cackle, is expounded the vidyā-s counting to 18,  
as if entirely extracting the worthy from the faulty, like filtering the milk from the water.

The cackle of their geese/swan or of them in swan/goose-form is said to be the exposition of 18 śāstra-s known as the aṣṭādaśa-vidyā-s. The Śaṃkara-maṭha-influenced Smārta mantravādin-s commenting on the Saundaryalaharī have tended to count this number 18 as 6 Vedāṅga-s, 4 Upaveda-s, 4 Veda-s and purāṇa-s, Darśana-s, Arthaśāstra and Kāmaśāstra each counting as 1. Some other similar reckonings are given by different commentators for the last tetrad. However, a closer examination of the śaiva tradition shows that originally, 18 vidyā-s meant a group of esoteric root śāstra-s of the Paścimāmnāya and, by extension, the Dakṣiṇāmnāya.

Indeed, the root Paścimāṃnāya texts like the Samvartā-maṇḍala-sūtra-s (SMS) and the MBT, and the Saṃvarta-prakāśa state that the first lineage of teaching from śiva and śakti (the haṃsa dyad of the above meditation) was transmitted by the 18 nātha-s known as the khecara-s. The 18-fold transmissions are also mentioned in a now-lost text known as the Bṛhadāgama, cited in a Nepalian ṭika on the Kubjikāmata-tantra. The teachings of these 18 are referred to as the “Aṣṭādaśa-divyāmnāyānukramam.” This 18-fold transmission is seen as the original divine layer atop the embodied transmissions of the human nātha-s. The latter consists of one branch of 3 lineages, known as the oli-s, with a teacher each in Oḍḍiyāna, Kāmarūpa and Pūrṇagiri and another branch of 9 nātha-s. The number 18, representing the divisions of the former teachings signifies what the Paścimāmnāya refers to as nava-nava-kalita: the 9 coming from Navātman-bhairava or Kubjīśāna and the 9 coming from Kubjikā or Ciñciṇī. The SMS state that the original tantra(s) of the kula-krama is this 18-fold teaching. At the beginning of the MBT, the Bhairava asks the Bhairavī to teach the 18 divisions:

etat sarvaṃ samāsena pūjya-sadbhāva-nirṇayam ।  
tasya+aṣṭādaśa-bhedāni kathaṃ jñāsyanti putrakāḥ ॥

All this, in brief, is the essence of the definition of worship.  
How will the putraka-s (initiated aspirants) know its 18-fold divisions?

These 18 tantra-s were expounded by the Bhairavī as:  
1. Unmana; 2. Manonmana; 3. Samanā; 4. Vyāpinyā; 5. Avyakta; 6. Nandinī; 7. Manthāna; 8. (P)Heruka; 9. Samaya; 10. Jambhala; 11. Kālasaṃkarṣa; 12 Caṇḍa; 13. Aghorīśa; 14. Trailokya; 15. Vinaya; 16. Kamala; 17. Carcikā; 18 Śrīnātha.

The nātha-s who taught these Vidyā-s are given as:  
1. Śabdarāśī; 2. Samvarta; 3. Khecara; 4. Ananta; 5. Amogha; 6. Bindunātha; 7. Anādi; 8. Śukra; 9. Ajātānanda; 10. Rakta; 11. Krīḍānātha; 12. Āśānanda; 13. Oghanātha 14. Rasānanda; 15. Dhvaja; 16. Jvālādeva; 17. Nagna; 18. Kubjānanda.

These 18 promulgators of the original teachings are saluted as part of the Paścimāmnāya practice, along with the offering of 18 different flowers. Given the importance of 18, its association with Haṃsa and the clear account of the 18 root scriptures in the Paścimāmnāya tantra-s, we believe that the Saundaryalaharī refers to precisely this when it speaks of the 18 Vidya-s emerging from Hamseśvara and Hamseśvarī. The break in transmission in the peninsula due to the savage Mohammedan irruptions resulted in the later Dakṣiṇāmnāya-affiliated commentators losing memory of this key point.

More generally, the presence of the Haṃsa-mantra across the Śaiva-mantra-mārga suggests that it was likely inherited from its Pāśupata substratum with deep Vedic roots. This, in turn, supports the contention that the [Pāśupata-brāhmaṇopaniṣad](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/the-pashupata-brahmopanishat-pashupata-brahma-brahmano-upanishad-pbu/) is preserving archaic Pāśupata material pertaining to this matter.
