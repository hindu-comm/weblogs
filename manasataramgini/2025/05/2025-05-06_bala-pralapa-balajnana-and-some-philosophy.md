Bāla-pralāpa, bālajñāna and some philosophy

In the long past days of our youth, the entrance exam to junior college often featured a problem in the mathematics paper involving the ages of a father and his son \[Footnote 1\]. If one interpreted the question correctly, then one could write out a quadratic equation, whose positive root gave the age of the father or the son. The second root of the equation was typically negative, and our textbook confidently informed us that it was meaningless, as nobody could have a negative age, and we were asked to ignore it without giving it much of a thought. In our year, too, the said problem appeared as we had anticipated. However, as fate would have it, when we proceeded to solve it with much confidence, we obtained an equation with two negative roots. At first, we thought we had made a sign error while setting up the equation and decided to come back to it in leisure after we had tackled the rest of the paper. However, after multiple trials, we realized we had done it right and indeed both roots were negative. Our mind started dangerously wandering away to whether this was evidence for time travel or rebirth or both: could the negative ages indicate the relationship between father and son in a past birth or could it mean that in principle father or son could travel back in time even as they lived out their time in the forward sense. However, our reverie was broken by the piercing rattle of the exam bell, indicating that our time with the paper had come to an end. Hence, in the last minute, we kept both negative values, stating that, as both had come out negative, we could choose either.

As we streamed out of the exam hall, the more scholarly of our classmates formed clumps, asking each other what they had done with the “erroneous” quadratic. Some of them thundered that we should have written that the question is wrong. Others confided that they had followed the textbook and written the solutions were meaningless. We offered our statement, to which some of our haters went crazy with glee, stating that we were wrong to state that we could choose either. They happily informed us that the right response was that we can choose neither. Knowing that it was pointless to argue with one’s haters, we ignored them and turned our horse homeward. However, on reaching home, doubt started seizing us as to whether we had done the right thing. So, we frantically added up a conservative estimate of what score we might get if we left out this problem. To our relief, we realized that even if we got no marks for the infamous quadratic, we would still get enough to make it to the college of our choice. That was all that mattered to us; hence, we stopped thinking much about it.

As we were savoring the long holidays, our mind wandered back to the bi-negative quadratic. At that point, our (limited) understanding of mathematics was already beginning to shape our philosophy. Through our exploration of geometry, we had already converged on our understanding of a “Platonic” theory of forms. We had come to realize that there existed an ideal world — a Platonic world — of pure geometric forms, e.g., a true Euclidean triangle, circle etc. The “phenomenal world” in which we live has various structures that are, to differing degrees, imperfect “reflections” or “shadows” of these pure forms in the “Platonic” realm — a śuddha-bhuvādhvan, so to speak. Some “media” in our real world are “fine” media — they better reproduce the forms in the Platonic realm. Others are coarse “media”; these only furnish hazy reflections or imprecise shadows of the form in the Platonic realm. Due to our geometric meditations, we had come to see all quadratics as merely an expression of parabolas, which are a subset of the conics in the Platonic realm. Returning to our quadratic in the exam, we realized that the medium of relationships between ages of father and son was a coarse one; hence, it could only partially reflect the elegant parabolas of the Platonic realm — i.e., the section encompassing the positive root — unless, like us, one entertained the possibility of retro-time machines or a past birth signal. By then, we had also come to realize another prevalent reflection of the parabola in our phenomenal world — the path of a projectile (e.g., a cricket ball or an arrow) under the influence of gravity:  
From Newton’s laws, the parametric form of this parabola in terms of the parameter time ![t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) would be:  
![x(t) = v \\cos \\theta t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+v+%5Ccos+%5Ctheta+t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)  
![y(t) = v \\sin \\theta t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29+%3D+v+%5Csin+%5Ctheta+t+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+g+t%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This yields the Cartesian form of its equation:

![y = x \\tan \\theta - \\dfrac{g x^2}{2 v^2 \\cos^2 \\theta}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x+%5Ctan+%5Ctheta+-+%5Cdfrac%7Bg+x%5E2%7D%7B2+v%5E2+%5Ccos%5E2+%5Ctheta%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

where ![(x,y)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) are the coordinates of the projectile, ![v](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) is its release velocity, ![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) the angle of its release, and ![g=9.81 m/s^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%3D9.81+m%2Fs%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) is the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity.

Thus, we saw physics under Newton’s equations of motion as a much finer medium providing a faithful reflection of the ideal parabola, encompassing the entire arc from root to root. More generally, we reached the position that physics was the medium that typically reflected the Platonic ideal realm most closely in the phenomenal world. In contrast, economics, quotidian business (like the issue of fathers’ and sons’ ages), and the like were typically coarse media providing only hazy images of the Platonic ideals. Thus, to us, the process of “tattvāveśa” or the penetration of knowledge on a subject involved the recognition of the Platonic ideals behind a phenomenon and an understanding of the degree to which it is faithfully reflected in the phenomenon.

In our early youth, we asked our father how the calculator managed to produce the values of the trigonometric functions for any ![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and, not just that, it could also spit out logarithms and exponents. Surely the little calculator did not store an enormous set of right triangles or log tables somewhere within it. As a prolegomenon to how it is done, our father let us in on the secret of the series expansions for these common functions:

![e^z = \\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{z^n}{n!} = 1 + z + \\dfrac{z^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{z^3}{3!} + \\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Ez+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cdfrac%7Bz%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D+%3D+1+%2B+z+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7Bz%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7Bz%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\cos(\\theta) = \\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\dfrac{\\theta^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} - \\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%28%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%28-1%29%5En+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E%7B2n%7D%7D%7B%282n%29%21%7D+%3D+1+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E4%7D%7B4%21%7D+-+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\sin(\\theta) = \\sum\_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\dfrac{\\theta^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = \\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} - \\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%28-1%29%5En+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E%7B2n%2B1%7D%7D%7B%282n%2B1%29%21%7D+%3D+%5Ctheta+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E5%7D%7B5%21%7D+-+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

We were greatly fascinated by these series and asked our father why the formulae for the trigonometric functions closely paralleled that of the exponential function. He simply told us that as our knowledge advanced, a profound realization would someday dawn on us as to why that was the case. With the bustle of quadratics with father’s and son’s ages behind us, we decided to spend some time during the long vacation exploring the mysteries of the complex variable. In the course of that, we finally got the answer to our question, and it was indeed a profound realization opened by Euler’s remarkable discovery:

![e^{i\\theta} = 1 + i\\theta + \\dfrac{(i\\theta)^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{(i\\theta)^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{(i\\theta)^4}{4!} + \\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+1+%2B+i%5Ctheta+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%28i%5Ctheta%29%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%28i%5Ctheta%29%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%28i%5Ctheta%29%5E4%7D%7B4%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Since ![(i^2 =
-1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%5E2+%3D+-1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), ![(i^3 =
-i)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%5E3+%3D+-i%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), ![(i^4 = 1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%5E4+%3D+1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), etc., we get:

![e^{i\\theta} = 1 + i\\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} - i \\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} + i \\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} - \\dots](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+1+%2B+i%5Ctheta+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D+-+i+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E4%7D%7B4%21%7D+%2B+i+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E5%7D%7B5%21%7D+-+%5Cdots&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

![e^{i\\theta} = \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^4}{4!} - \\dots \\right) + i \\left( \\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{\\theta^5}{5!} - \\dots \\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+%5Cleft%28+1+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E2%7D%7B2%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E4%7D%7B4%21%7D+-+%5Cdots+%5Cright%29+%2B+i+%5Cleft%28+%5Ctheta+-+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E3%7D%7B3%21%7D+%2B+%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E5%7D%7B5%21%7D+-+%5Cdots+%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This gives us the real cosine series and the imaginary sine series, thus:

![e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+%5Ccos%28%5Ctheta%29+%2B+i+%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore \|e^{i\\theta}\|= \\cos^2(\\theta) - (-1 \\sin^2(\\theta))=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+%7Ce%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D%7C%3D+%5Ccos%5E2%28%5Ctheta%29+-+%28-1+%5Csin%5E2%28%5Ctheta%29%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

With the vacations behind us, we learnt from the results that the “flawed” quadratic did not bring us down, and we found ourselves in the college of our choice. The teacher was just beginning to introduce the ![\\sqrt{-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and complex numbers in class. Our attention suddenly perked up when she said something like: “I must emphasize that complex numbers are not like real numbers that can be conceptualized using objects in the real world. Whereas real numbers have a genuine meaning relating to our existence, complex numbers are merely an algebraic trick for ‘higher mathematics’ with no meaning in reality.” We smiled to ourselves for it seemed that despite living in the late 1900s, her view of these “algebraic tricks” was not unlike those of its discoverers.

Although by medieval times, Hindu mathematicians (e.g., Brahmagupta) already had an understanding of negative numbers (after all it had rather direct reflections in the real world, such as in economics — the concept of debt) and of negative roots of quadratic equations (clearly presented by Bhāskara-II), it was a struggle before these ideas took root in European mathematics. As European mathematics was fully coming to terms with this, mathematicians in what is today Italy were beginning to grapple with the formula for the solution of cubic equations. As part of this quest, Niccolò Tartaglia \[Footnote 2\] discovered a formula for cubic solutions that sometimes involved assuming ![\\sqrt{-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002). He kept it secret as it helped him win contests against rival mathematicians, but revealed it under the oath of secrecy to the polymath Gerolamo Cardano. Cardano later found out that another Italian, del Ferro, had discovered the solution for some special cases prior to Tartaglia. This gave him an excuse to break the oath and publish a general version of the formula that today goes under Cardano’s name, much to Tartaglia’s dismay. In developing his version, Cardano was much assisted by his student Ludvico Ferrari, who also helped him discover the quartic formula. Cardano’s publication marked the birth of complex numbers in literature, but he himself never accepted them as anything more than an algebraic trick \[Footnote 3\] and remarked that they were: “as subtle as they are useless.” This brought to mind a quip of one of our classmates as to why on earth we were being taught complex numbers when the teacher herself had declared that they have no meaning in real life. These numbers defined by ![\\sqrt{-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) had to await a long line of Tartaglia’s intellectual successors to be placed on a firmer footing. However, even René Descartes, who, a century later, put them on a much firmer footing, called them “imaginary numbers”, lending them an air of “unrealness.”

However, the reason we found the college teacher’s statement grating was because, as part of our autodidacticism of the complex numbers, we had already come to see them as legitimate denizens of the Platonic world with reflections in the phenomenal one. While born Hindu, we had a streak of our yavana cousins in privileging the geometric understanding of things. However, by the time we had begun that exploration, the inner Hindu in us was solidifying as we were coming to understand geometric forms in the Platonic realm as manifestations of rules acting on pure numbers in another Platonic space lying beneath that of the geometric forms. We saw how complex numbers, organically and often with greater intuitiveness than real numbers, gave rise to geometric forms. Further, operations on them described manipulations of geometric forms in an entirely organic way. [These included objects of our first explorations, like operations on conics:](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/04/30/trigonometric-tangles-3-the-fractals/) the squashing of circles to form ellipses; the bending of straight lines to form a parabola; the bending and splitting of straight lines to form hyperbolas; the process of distorting a circle to a hippopede of Proclus, then twisting it into a lemniscate and finally breaking it apart as a pair of Cassinian ovals. Then there were the fractals like the Julia and the Mandelbrot sets, which in many ways had partial reflections in the natural world. It was things like this that showed us that complex numbers were anything but a mere algebraic device — they were palpable denizens of a Platonic realm that produced discernible shadows or reflections in our own.

However, it was only a little later, when we delved into the basics of quantum mechanics, that it dawned on us that the complex variable with the above-illustrated relationship between the exponential and trigonometric functions has a reflection in the very fabric of the phenomenal world. Although one could argue that with things like distortions of conics and fractals (at least in some cases), one could write a real variable version of the same, in the quantum realm, the complex variable forces itself upon us. While all this most elementary bālajñāna in physics, we illustrate it below in case a bālabuddhi wishes to retrace our path. The most profound realization of quantum mechanics, which was forced upon us by the observed physics, is the existence of a wave-particle duality of matter/energy. The wave aspect of it might be seen as the determinant of an underlying probability distribution for where the particle might be observed. A consequence of this duality is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which can be understood in an approximate manner as follows (put together from a bunch of treatments found in various pedagogical materials for basic physics). Consider a particle detector that is scanning to detect a particle along a line (say an electron on the red line in Figure 1). It emits photons that pass out through its aperture, and if a particle is there within the width of the aperture, it would reflect the photon back. A sensor “catches” the reflected photons at the backend, thus registering the detection.

[![](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heisenberg_uncertainty.png)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heisenberg_uncertainty.png)

The position will be recorded with uncertainty corresponding to the width of the detector aperture ![(\\Delta x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CDelta+x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002). Due to the wave-particle duality observed in quantum systems, the photon will not bounce back straight like a ball in the classical regime but will come out somewhere along a cone, i.e., prior to observation by the sensor, it will be “smeared” across its corresponding wave. This “smear” will be determined by the aperture: the smaller the aperture, the greater will be the smear, and the angle of the cone of reflection ![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) is related to the wavelength ![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) of the photon and the aperture of the detector, thus:  
![\\sin(\\theta)=\\dfrac{\\lambda}{\\Delta x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B%5CDelta+x%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore \\lambda= \\Delta x \\sin(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+%5Clambda%3D+%5CDelta+x+%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now the momentum of the photon ![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) is also determined by its wavelength ![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and from Planck’s foundational equation of quantum mechanics is given by:

![p= \\tfrac{h}{\\lambda}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bh%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), where Planck’s constant ![h = 6.626070015 \\times 10^{-34} J \\cdot s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%3D+6.626070015+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-34%7D+J+%5Ccdot+s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Now, since it is not reflected straight back but returns along a cone with angle ![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), the momentum will have a horizontal component along the horizontal direction, i.e., parallel to ![\\Delta x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002). This horizontal component of the momentum ![\\Delta p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) will be given by:

![\\Delta p = p \\sin(\\theta)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+p+%3D+p+%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Plugging the above equation for wavelength ![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) into this we get:

![\\Delta p = \\tfrac{h}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\tfrac{\\lambda}{\\Delta x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+p+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bh%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B%5CDelta+x%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

![\\therefore \\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x = h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+%5CDelta+p+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+x+%3D+h&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we get the relationship between the one-dimensional uncertainty in position ![\\Delta x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and the uncertainty in momentum ![\\Delta p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) along the same direction, i.e., an approximate form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Hence, inherently in a quantum system, if one reduces the uncertainty in momentum, then the uncertainty in position goes up and vice versa. A physicist will snort and frown at this presentation as it is done without any of the mathematical formalism of the non-0 commutation relation between the momentum and position operators. However, in our opinion, this is sufficient for understanding the uncertainty principle and provides the necessary knowledge of it to move forward. However, if one were to apply the requisite mathematical formalism to obtaining the uncertainty relationship, one gets tighter bounds, and it takes the form:

![\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x \\ge \\tfrac{\\hslash}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+p+%5Ccdot+%5CDelta+x+%5Cge+%5Ctfrac%7B%5Chslash%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), where ![\\hslash = \\tfrac{h}{2\\pi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chslash+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7Bh%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) is the reduced Planck’s constant.

Thus, the formal lower bound on uncertainty is reduced by ![4\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) relative to what we derived above.

Let us consider a free particle (e.g., an electron or a photon) moving in one dimension with a definite momentum. Given the wave-particle duality inherent to quantum mechanics, it can be represented as a plane wave, viz., a wave propagating in a single direction with constant amplitude ![A](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and phase, characterized by a definite wavelength ![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and frequency. Representing such a plane as a real function would yield:

![\\Psi(x) = A\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi x}{\\lambda}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPsi%28x%29+%3D+A%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi+x%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Expressing ![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) in terms of momentum, we get:  
![\\Psi(x) = A\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi p x}{h}\\right) = A\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{p x}{\\hslash}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPsi%28x%29+%3D+A%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi+p+x%7D%7Bh%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+A%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Bp+x%7D%7B%5Chslash%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002),

In quantum mechanics, as first shown by Max Born, this wave defines the probability density of finding its corresponding particle at a given point, thus:  
![\|\\Psi(x)\|^2 = \\left\|A\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{p x}{\\hslash}\\right)\\right\|^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5CPsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%3D+%5Cleft%7CA%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Bp+x%7D%7B%5Chslash%7D%5Cright%29%5Cright%7C%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

This will give a probability density determined by the function ![\\cos^2(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5E2%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) and will oscillate between 0 and ![A^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) as ![\\cos^2(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5E2%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002) oscillates between 0 and 1. Thus, the probability density is non-uniform.

However, this formulation based on a real wave function runs afoul of the uncertainty principle. As the momentum of this particle is precisely defined as ![p, \\Delta p =0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C+%5CDelta+p+%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002), its position will be maximally, i.e., infinitely uncertain. Thus, its probability density along the x-dimension would be entirely uniform – you are equally likely to find it anywhere along that dimension. However, with the real wave function, we get an oscillating probability density, implying that there is zero density for it at certain points. This is clearly incompatible with the uncertainty principle. Hence, the only wave function that can be compatible with a quantum particle is the complex exponential, which, as we saw above, is the combination of a real and an imaginary trigonometric wave:

![\\Psi(x) = Ae^{\\tfrac{i p x}{\\hslash}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPsi%28x%29+%3D+Ae%5E%7B%5Ctfrac%7Bi+p+x%7D%7B%5Chslash%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

For this wave function, the probability density of finding a particle at a given point is:  
![\|\\Psi(x)\|^2 = \\left\| Ae^{\\tfrac{i p x}{\\hslash}}\\right\|^2 = A^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5CPsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%3D+%5Cleft%7C+Ae%5E%7B%5Ctfrac%7Bi+p+x%7D%7B%5Chslash%7D%7D%5Cright%7C%5E2+%3D+A%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0&c=20201002)

Thus, we get a uniform density throughout as enjoined by the uncertainty principle. Hence, irrespective of whether one may or may not be able to conceptualize the complex exponential mentally, it lies at the foundation of reality itself. In fact, the basic fabric of existence, the quantum world, is a pure reflection of this form resident in the Platonic realm.

The mathematics of the complex variable had undergone extensive development between the 1530s, starting with Tartaglia’s initial intuitions, down to the great triumphs of Euler, Gauss, Bolyai, and Riemann in the 1800s. However, quantum mechanics made its appearance with [Max Planck’s heroics only in 1900](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/1859-ce-and-beyond-some-reflections/). Further, the introduction of the complex wave function to describe quantum entities had to wait till Schrödinger’s work in 1926, followed by Born’s interpretation of it in terms of probability density. Thus, the exploration of the Platonic realm by some of the greatest minds long preceded the actual discovery of its “reflection” in our phenomenal world. This preceding purely mathematical exploration ultimately paved the way for recognizing its reflection in the world. In some ways, this mirrored the story of the conics — they were discovered and studied by Plato’s associates and intellectual successors, such as the “god-like Archimedes” more or less as an exploration of that pure realm. However, this prior exploration allowed their discovery in the phenomenal world, such as in the trajectories of projectiles and the orbits of celestial bodies under gravitational potentials. Hence, we came to generally believe that mathematics is discovered and not invented for human convenience. Further, we hold that this discovery process involves first making a connection to the ideal Platonic realm and then exploring it via that initially established conduit. We believe this is noticeable in the process by which both laymen and mathematicians tend to get their insights. It is not by formally working out reams of algebra or arithmetic but via a sudden flash of insight. That flash of insight corresponds to establishing a connection to that Platonic ideal realm.

The evolutionary process through natural selection has molded our neural networks to have what we term “broadband” conduits for certain forms in the ideal world. Thus, we recognize real integers, rationals, and basic conics like the circle and the lines more easily. We consider these to be “natural” or “real.” There are other equally genuine forms in that realm that our neural networks do not have “broadband” access to. Even as our cousin, the chimpanzee, cannot grasp calculus, the neural networks of most ordinary men might not even be capable of opening a conduit to certain forms residing in the ideal realm. Thus, the size and architecture of the neural network influence whether or not the more “esoteric” parts of the ideal world can be accessed. This raises the question as to whether the artificial neural nets (NNs), which have taken the world by storm in the past 5 years, acquire conduits to the more subtle parts of the ideal Platonic realm. Recent studies have shown that a class of them, the LLMs, despite having architectures very different from that of mammalian brains, process and generate human language very similar to real brains. The first powerful LLMs seemed to have acquired a basic mathematical logic for free, but were relatively poor at arithmetic and, to a degree, algebra. However, some of the latest ones (e.g., Durguggulu’s buddhi) have considerably improved and can sometimes do quite sophisticated calculations. Further, dedicated models trained on a large body of theorems can prove geometric theorems not present in their training set; however, so far, there are no indications that they are producing fundamentally new mathematics. Does this imply that increasingly sophisticated training, adding more neurons and layers, and feeding them more specific human-generated data can lead to these NNs actually acquiring conduits to the more subtle parts of the Platonic ideal realm? So far, we have not seen signs, but we believe this might be a critical test similar to [Chalmers’ question](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/experience-phenomenal-and-accessional/) of whether they would be philosophical zombies or conscious.
