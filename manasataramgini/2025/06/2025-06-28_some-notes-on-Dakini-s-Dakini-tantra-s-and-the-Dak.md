Some notes on Ḍakinī-s, Ḍakinī-tantra-s and the Ḍakinī-kalpa

Unlike in the case of the Hindu tantra-s, the traditional classification of the Bauddha tantra-s approximates their evolutionary sequence. Briefly, they are classified into [four major groups](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/nastika-notes-2/): the Kriyā, the Caryā, Yoga and Yoginī tantra-s. While these classes are temporally overlapping, some of the Kriyā tantra-s contain some of the oldest mantra material of the Tantric type that lies at the transition between the Vedic and the Tantric mantra-śāstra-s. The last layer of Bauddha tantra composition, the Yoginī tantra collection, as suggested by its name, features cults with a strong dominance of erotic and cremation-ground goddesses and an associated Bhairava-like deity (e.g., Caṇdamahāroṣaṇa, Hevajra, Cakrasaṃvara and Kālacakra).

It has been known for some time that the Bauddha Yoginī tantra-s, heavily plagiarized material from the Śaiva Bhairava-srotas and its Kaula evolutes. However, while the term “Yoginī” or “Yogeśvarī” is most commonly used for the central cultic goddesses in the Śaiva system, the Bauddha-s tend to use the term Ḍākinī for their equivalent deities. While the etymology of the word Ḍākinī is somewhat mysterious, it is commonly believed to be derived from the root ḍi, to fly. This raises the possibility that they are related to a group of Yoginī-s known as Khecharī-s, who are mentioned in Bhairava-srotas texts like Tantrasadbhāva. However, to our knowledge, this connection is not widely articulated in the scriptures we have studied to date. It is notable and even somewhat surprising that in most of the earliest extant Śaiva material, Ḍākinī and the closely related Śākinī (deities probably originally associated with the possessed trees, c.f. Vaṭa-yakṣiṇī) are primarily featured as malevolent deities, and are not the focus of yāga-s of those systems. Below, we provide multiple examples of such from different layers of the mantraśāstra:

1\. In the late Vedic tradition, the conclusion of Bodhāyana’s Rudra-mahānyāsa features an incantation intended to fierily repel afflictions inflicted by various malign entities, including the Ḍākinīs, Śākinīs, and other familiar adversaries:  
tato bhūta-preta-piśāca-brahmarākṣasa-yakṣa-yamadūta-śākini-ḍākini-sarpa-śvāpada-taskarādy-upadravāḥ sarve jvalantam paśyantu । māṃ rakṣantu ।  
Then may all these afflictions – bhūta-s, preta-s, piśāca-s, brahma-rākṣasa-s, yakṣa-s, messengers of Yama, Śākinī-s, Ḍākinī-s, serpents, wild beasts, thieves and others – see \[me\] as blazing. May the \[Rudra-s\] protect me.

2\. A similar position regarding the Ḍakinī-s continues into the Śaiva-sāmānya-dharma expressed in the Śivadharma:  
ḍākinyo vividhākārā rakṣāṃsi preta-nāyakāḥ ।  
na tasya pīḍāṃ kurvanti tathā cānye’pi hiṃsakāḥ ।।  
Ḍākinī-s of various forms, rākṣasa-s, and leaders of ghosts, do not cause harm/affliction to him, and likewise other malevolent beings.

3\. The Uḍḍāmareśvara tantra is a well-preserved Ḍamara-tantra that was perhaps originally affiliated with the Bhūtasrotas, and gives two mantra-s pertaining to Ḍākinī-s. The first of these, named Sarva-bhūta-ḍākinī-damana-mantra, invokes Caṇḍeśvara and, as its name indicates, is deployed for the subjugation of ghosts and Ḍākinī-s:  
oṃ namo bhagavate vajrāya caṇḍeśvarāya īṃ īṃ phaṭ svāhā ।।  
The second, known as the Ḍākinī-doṣa-vināśana, invokes Maheśvara together with Nṛsiṃha, directed by Rudra, for destroying the ill-effects of Ḍākinī-s. Thus, in both these cases, the Ḍākinī-s seem to have primarily a negative effect that is suppressed by the mantra-s of the deities of these tantra-s.

4\. We have comparable counter-Ḍākinī spells invoking Unmatta-bhairava or his consort, the goddess Vārāhī, in the eponymous Bhairava-tantra, e.g.:  
oṃ aiṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ unmatta-bhairavo huṃ phaṭ duṣṭa-ḍākinī tejaṃ nāśaya mamābhayaṃ kuru 2 huṃ ḍākinīṃ māraya māraya svāhā ।।

5\. In a similar vein, the Pañcarātra Vaiṣṇava Jayākhya-saṃhitā mentions the countering of Ḍākinī-s on multiple occasions. Specifically, it has a deployment of the Mantra-rāja to counter Ḍākinī-s:  
graha-jvara-viṣādīnāṃ bhūtānāṃ ca pramardanam ।  
ḍākinīnāṃ ca sarvāsāṃ hrāsane mantra-nāyakam ।।  
For the destruction of graha-s, fevers, poisons and other \[ailments\], and of ghosts, and for the curtailing of all Ḍākinīs – \[this is\] the chief mantra.

6\. Surprisingly, Ḍākinī and Śākinī retain a certain negative connotation even in the Vidyāpīṭha class of tantras in the Bhairava srotas, like the Tantra-sadbhāva and the related Pūrvāmnāya text, the Siddhayogeśvarī-mata. Here, among the samaya-s of the dīkṣita is the proscription on uttering the word Ḍākinī (Tantra-sadbhāva) or Śākinī (Siddhayogeśvarī-mata):  
ḍākinīti na vaktavyam pramādān mantrinā api ।

However, these names appear as those of Kula-s of Yoginī-s in the Vidyāpīṭha tradition, but even there, they retain a malevolent character and are not the most prominent group of Yoginī-s receiving high worship in the extant tantra-s of this group.

7\. Notably, the Bauddha Krīyā-tantra, the Mañjuśrīya Mūlakalpa, while mentioning ḍākinī-s a few times, primarily presents them in a negative light and even features prayoga-s to counter them.

These observations raise the question as to what was the origin of the more positive interpretation of the Ḍākinī-s and Śākinī-s in the later Tantric Bauddha tradition and certain branches of the Śaiva-śāsana. For this, we have to turn to the famous Gaṅgdhār inscription of 424 CE of Mayūrākṣaka, the minister of Viśvavarman, where the Ḍākinī-s appear early on in the context of Mātṛkā worship. It has a statement in a lacunose line reading: “… idaṃ dākinī-samprakīrṇaṃ veśma+aty ugraṃ nṛpati-sacivo ‘kārayat puṇyahetoḥ ॥‘’ This inscription talks of the establishment of a shrine of the Mātṛ-s which is endowed with the mighty power of the tantra-s (tantrodbhūta) and permeated with Ḍākinī-s who evidently make the shrine exceedingly awe-inspiring (aty ugram). This hints that there was a lineage of the Śaiva-Śākta tradition, where the Ḍākinī-s, while still fierce or even malevolent, had a cultic prominence.

In textual terms, we have a tantalizing reference to Ḍākinī as part of an epithet of Nandin, in stotra addressed to him in the Ur-Skandapurāṇa (adhyāya 72) by Agni:  
namo gaṇādhipataye namaścaṇḍāya śūline ।  
namaḥ senādhipataye namaḥ sarvātmane sadā ।। 61।।  
hālāhalāya rudrāya nīlarudrāya vai namaḥ ।  
namo ḍākinirudrāya tathaivārdrapaṭāya ca ।। 62।।  
namaste svapnarudrāya bhasmarudrāya te namaḥ ।  
namaḥ śmaśānarudrāya koṭīrudrāya te namaḥ ।। 63।।  
namaḥ piṅgalarudrāya rudrādhipataye namaḥ ।  
namaḥ pramatharudrāya bhūtarudrāya te namaḥ ।  
virūpākṣāya rudrāya śvetarudrāya te namaḥ ।। 64।।  
namaste satataṃ deva namaste satataṃ śiva ।  
namaste satataṃ saumya namaste bhaktivatsala ।। 65।।

This Purāṇa could approximately be coeval with the famous Gaṅgdhār inscription, suggesting that there was a tradition associating Ḍākinī-s with Rudra-s by then. In this regard, while Ḍākinī-s are rarely mentioned in the tantra-s of the Siddhānta (Īśāna-srotas) tradition, we find a notable reference in a purely Śaiva context in the Saiddhāntika Sūkṣmāgama. Here, comparable to the role of Nandin, Ḍākinī is invoked as one of the dvāradevatā-s of the śaiva temple sanctum, also establishing a connection to the temple cult seen in the Gaṅgdhār inscription:  
ḍākiniṃ savyataḥ pūjya arcayitva krameṇa tu ।  
ūrdhve pataṅga-madhye tu mahālakṣmī prapūjayet ।।  
Having worshipped Ḍākinī on the left side, and having ritually honored \[her\] in sequence, above, in the middle of the upper section, one should worship Mahālakṣmī.

A further paurāṇika reference to Ḍākinī and Śākinī is seen in the [Mega-Skandapurāṇa](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/02/08/on-the-rise-of-the-mat%e1%b9%9bka-s-and-the-goddess-camu%e1%b9%87%e1%b8%8da/) (1.1.3.49-53; Māheśvara-khaṇḍa, Kedāra-khaṇḍa), where they are mentioned alongside the nine Durgā-s, the ghosts, pramatha-s, Kubera’s agents and the circle of 64 Yoginī-s in the retinue of Vīrabhadra during his assault on Dakṣa’s yajña. However, this text is believed to be much later than the Ur-Skandapurāṇa. Another tantalizing reference to Śākinī is in the Pañcatantra, in the tale of the wicks of Bhairavānanda. Here, the four brāhmaṇa boys desiring wealth are willing to undertake a [Śākinī-sādhanā](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/07/17/bhairavanandas-wicks-a-retelling/). While it is uncertain when this tale was incorporated into the Pañcatantra, the context of its occurrence (alongside the ritual use of human flesh) favors a relatively early date.

Against this background, it is curious that the Bauddha scholar Dharmakīrti, in his attack on Hindu ritual systems, uses the phrase: “…ḍākinī-bhaginī-tantrādiśu darśanāt’’. He is believed to have lived close to Ādi Śaṃkarācarya in time (\~600-660 CE). The Bauddha tantra-s from this time, surviving in Sanskrit or Chinese translation, do not yet show any signs of adopting Ḍākinī-s as central deities of their Tantric system. In fact, they even assign negative roles to them (e.g., above: Mañjuśrīya Mūlakalpa). However, we have evidence from the Gilgit manuscripts that the Śaiva Vāma-srotas tantra-s – the Bhaginī tantra-s were already in place by then. Hence, together with Dharmakīrti’s polemical reference to them, we should assume that there was also a non-Bauddha (Hindu) class of tantra-s in place by then known as the Ḍākinī-tantra-s. Based on the Gaṅgdhār inscription, we may infer that they likely had a Śaiva-Śākta orientation, with an emphasis on the second element of that dyad. Hence, we suspect that in these apparently lost Ḍākinī-tantra-s, the Ḍākinī-s played overlapping roles with the Yoginī-s and Mātṛ-s of the more standard Bhairava-srotas tantra-s and their Kaula evolutes. Hence, it seems that although the Bauddha Yoginī tantra-s borrowed heavily from the Bhairava/Kaula material, they inherited the class name “Ḍākinī’’ of their cultic female deities from these posited Ḍākinī-tantra-s. We see the first glimmer of this in the Sarva-tathāgata-tattva-saṃgraha, where the mantra of the “vajrified’’ Cāmuṇḍā, i.e., Vajrakālī, calls her Vajraḍākinī.

On the Hindu side, we believe that some of the material from the old Ḍākinī-tantra-s was incorporated into the Kaula tradition. We review examples of this material below.

1\. As a backdrop for the Kaula traditions, one may consider the Vidyāpīṭha texts of the Bhairava-srotas from which they evolved. As we saw above, some of these and the old Pūrvāmnāya branch of the Kaula tradition did not have a prominent positive Ḍākinī cult. The Brahma-yāmala or the Picumata is one of the old Vidyāpīṭha texts, which shows an early version of the Mātṛ/Yoginī yāgā. It has clear hints of a more positive ritual incorporation of the Śākinī-s, Ḍākinī-s, Lākinī-s and related deities. For instance, in the Mahāvrata, if the sādhaka succeeds in pleasing Bhairava, he gets a boon. The sādhaka then beseeches the Bhairava to enter his body. Bhairava then instructs the sādhaka to open his mouth, and through it enters into his heart. Bhairava is accompanied by several female deities who enter various organs of the sādhaka: the Mātṛ-s enter his limbs, the Yakṣiṇī-s (Guhyakā-s) enter his throat, Yoginī-s enter his joints, Śākinī-s and Pūtanā-s enter his hair follicles. Elsewhere in the Brahmayāmala, Ḍākinī-s and Rudraḍākinī-s are respectively said to be emanated by the Kāla and Māyā tattva level of the Śaiva hierarchy, whereas the Puruṣa-tattva level emanates Yoginī-s. Further, the text mentions Lākinī-s being emanated by Ucchuṣma-bhairava. Finally, it has a curious statement regarding Śākinī-s among others:  
Matṛ-yoginikā yāni śākinīnām kulāni tu ।  
sidhyanti sādhakendrasya yogenānena suvrate ।।  
kathayanti ca sadbhāvaṃ kulajaṃ jnanam uttamam ।  
The Kula-s (clusters) of Matṛ-s, Yoginī-s, \[and\] Śākinī-s, confer siddhi on the chief of the sadhaka-s through this yoga, O lady of good vows; and they teach the true essence, \[which is\] the highest knowledge arising from the Kula.

Thus, it sees the Ḍākinī, Śākinī-s and Lākinī-s as positive elements of its pantheon and even as transmitters of the scripture – a feature associated with the Yoginī-s at the base of the Kaula system (see below).

2\. Affiliated with the Brahma-yāmala is a South Indian text known as the Mātṛṇām utsava (The Ceremony of the Mātṛ-s) that outlines the Yāmala-based temple worship of the Mātṛ-s and Mahākāla. It lists a series of deities invoked by the mantrin in the pīṭha of the maṇḍala of the Mātṛ-s and Mahākāla. Here, Ḍākinī comes along with Yoginī, Śākinī, Pūtanā and some other such deities with a malevolent disposition, including the Skandagraha-s and piṣāca-s:  
vasavaś cāṣṭabhiś caiva dvādaśāditya eva ca ।  
rudrā ekādaśa sarve aśvinyāś ca samanvitam ॥  
indrāgni yama-nirṛti vāruṇa-vāyureva ca ।  
someśānas tathā caiva āgachantu namo namaḥ ॥  
brāhmī māheśvarī caiva kaumārī vaiṣṇavī tathā ।  
vārāhī ca tathendrāṇī cāmuṇḍī gaṇa-rudrakā ॥  
ity ete kramaśaś caiva māṇāṃ ca namo namaḥ ।  
Yoginī ḍākinī caiva sākinī pūtanā tataḥ ॥  
pālinī dundubhiś caiva tathocchiṣṭā ca mātaraḥ ।  
bhūtapreta piśācāś ca vetālaṃ ca tathaiva ca ॥  
kumāra-graha-kūśmāṇḍa mahādeva-grahas tathā ।  
sarvaṃ ca sarvalokaṃ ca sarvapīṭhaṃ ca devatā ॥

Thus, like in the Saiddhāntika Sūkṣmāgama, Ḍākinī and Śākinī are incorporated as subsidiary deities of the Mātṛ-maṇḍala of the Brahma-yāmala affiliated Mātṛṇām utsava. While the extant Rudra-yāmala Uttara-tantra is not of the same antiquity as the extant Brahma-yāmala, its reference to the Ḍākinī is again in a liminal sense, stating that: “The Ḍākinī devours him who is devoid of initiation in the mantra-bīja-s’’:  
ḍākinī taṃ bhakṣayati dīkṣā-mantrārṇa-hīnakam ।

While the above Yāmala references do not indicate a whole-scale cultic focus, they clearly show an accepting attitude towards the Ḍākinī-s and related deities. It remains to be seen if this might have arisen due to the lateral influence of the postulated old Ḍākinī-tantra-s or from an independent Śaiva tradition that accepted Ḍākinī-s and related deities as key, even if peripheral, components of its maṇḍala. These provide a background for the below references, which support the full incorporation of the Ḍākinī class of deities as a primarily Kaula phenomenon.

3\. One of the earliest surviving Kaula texts is the Yogapīṭha-kramodaya (YPK). It probably just precedes or is close to the initial branching of the tradition into the āmnāya-s. In this text, we see an abhicārikā rite, performed in the cemetery, which is related to the terrific essence-sucking Yoginī rites of the early tantra-s of the Bhairava-srotas. At the center of this yāga of 7 Yoginī-s, one named Kusumamālinī (= Hākinī based on her mantra). She is surrounded by the six further Yoginī-s, Yākinī, Śākinī, Kākinī, Lākinī, Rākinī and Ḍākinī (some names corrupted in the Nepalian manuscript). These are none other than the deities known as the Dhātunāthā-s or the “tissue-Yoginī-s”, sometimes also known as the Ḍakinī-s (see below) of the Kulāmnāya-s. For example, in the Dakṣiṇāmnāya they are associated with cakra-s stationed along the spinal Kula-patha (the metaphorical Ekavṛkṣa: Suṣumṇa). They also preside over the seven dhātu-s or “tissues” comprising the body. According to the YPK, the seven in the above order respectively correspond to the semen, bone, connective tissue (sinew), muscle, marrow, blood, and skin. In the rite, they are called upon to afflict the respective tissues of the enemies. These Yoginī-s appear in the Traipura (Śrīkula) stream of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya in maṇḍala of Vārāhī known as the Kiricakra (an association not found in the YPK). Their mantra-s are similarly deployed in the apotropaic rites centered on Vārāhī. In the Bhaṇḍāsura war (Lalitopākhyāna of the Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa), they appear as warrior goddesses, keeping with their ancient deployment in an abhicārikā rite.

4\. The Kaula-jñāna-nirṇāya (KJN) of Matsyendranātha (Macchaghnapāda) is another early Kaula tantra that identifies itself with the original Kaula teaching of the Yoginī-(s) known as Yoginī-Kaula. In a corrupt part of the text (Final part of KJN paṭala 4), which specifies a series of mantra-s along with the Tāntrika Mṛtyuñjaya mantra (oṃ jūṃ saḥ ॥: expounded further the tradition of Netranātha), we find mention of a series of mantra-s known as Ḍakinī-siddhi, Rākinī-siddhi, Lākinī-siddhi, Kusumamālinī-siddhi and Yoginī (emended: Yākinī)-siddhi. Given the corruption of the text, it is likely the original had a complete set of 6 or 7 Dhāthunāthā-s as in YPK. Further down (beginning of paṭala 9 of the KJN), in the context of the Gurupañkti of the Yoginī-Kaula system, the text mentions the worship of a subset of the Dhātunāthā Yoginī-s: Lākinī, Ḍākinī, Śākinī, Kākinī and Yākinī (probably all were there in the original text).

5\. The Kaṅkālamālinī-tantra identifies itself as a scripture of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya. It names 16 Ḍākinī-s corresponding to the 16 svara-s of the Sanskrit Varṇamāla:  
(a) vidyudjihvā (ā) karālāsyā (i) garjinī (ī) dhūmrabhairavī ॥  
(u) kālarātrir (ū) viḍārī ca (ṛ) mahāraudrī (ṝ) bhayaṃkarī ।  
(ḷ) saṃhāriṇī (ḹ) karālinī (e) ūrdhvakeśy (ai) ugrabhairavī ॥  
(o) bhīmākṣī (au) ḍākinī ceti (aṃ) rudraḍākinī (aḥ) caṇḍikā ।

This association of the Ḍākinī-s with the svara-s continues with the singular Ḍākinī in the Tantrarāja-tantra of the Śrīkula lineage of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya. Here, as noted above, the Dhātunāthā-s are stationed in the cakra-s along the Kulapatha. Specifically, Ḍākinī is positioned in the Viśuddha-cakra in the throat region in a 16-petalled smoky colored lotus with the svara-s:  
viśuddhākhye kaṇṭha-deśe ṣoḍaśa-svara-patrake ।  
dhūmra-varṇāmbuje devīṃ ḍākinīṃ tat samākṛtim ॥

6\. The Gandharva tantra associated with the Śrīkula lineage of Dakṣiṇāmnāya (prominent in its Kashmirian expression) gives the Ḍākinī mantra (along with those of the other Dhāthunāthā-s), with her as the Tvag-dhātunāthā again clearly associating her with the svarā-s. At the same time her mantra also hints at her connection to the old essence-sucking powers of the Yoginī-s of the Vidyāpīṭha tantra: aṃ āṃ iṃ īṃ uṃ ūṃ ṛṃ ṛṃ ḷṃ ḹṃ eṃ aiṃ oṃ auṃ aṃ aṃ ḍāṃ ḍīṃ ḍamalavarayūṃ ḍākinyai namaḥ ḍākini tvag-dhātu-gate catuṣ-ṣaṣṭi-lakṣa-koṭi-Yoginī svāmini sarva-sattva-vaśaṃkari ājñā me dehi mama vicce ॥

7\. The Jñānārṇava tantra of the Śrīkula lineage of the Dakṣiṇāmnāya tradition gives six Dhātunāthā-s starting with Ḍākinī in the Maṇḍala of Kāmeśvarī:  
ḍākinīṃ rākinīṃ caiva lākinīṃ kākinīṃ tathā ॥ 6.27  
śākinīṃ hākinīṃ devi paścimādi-kramād yajet ।

The same is seen in the Tantrarāja-tantra too, where they are described as having forms resembling Kāmeśvarī:  
rakṣo.anilendra-vahnīśa-varuṇeṣu kramāc ca tāḥ ।  
ḍākinīṃ śākinīṃ paścāl lākinīṃ kākinīm api ॥  
sākinīṃ hākinīm mūle devī-sadṛśa-vigrahāḥ ।  
hetīs tām abhitaḥ śakti-rūpās tan mukuṭā-natāḥ ॥

8\. The Śakti-sūtra, an early text of the Paścimāmnāya, provides the pādukā-tarpaṇa of the seven Dhātunāthā-s and calls that group the Mātṛkogha. It further provides the bīja of Ḍākinī (similar to that in the mantra from the Gandharva-tantra) along with those of the other Dhātunāthā-s.

9\. The Paścimāmnāya-affiliated Kālānala-tantra repeatedly identifies its goddess with the Ḍākinī.

10\. The Uttarāmnāya-affiliated Hāhārāva-tantra, which teaches the yāga-s of Guhyakālī, Pratyaṅgirā and Turīyā, has both negative and positive allusions to Ḍākinī-s. It has a prayoga for countering Ḍākinī-s along with ghosts and Brahma-rākṣasa-s, and also a yantra for protection against both Ḍākinī-s and Śākinī-s, among others. On the other hand, it incorporates the erotic forms of six Dhātunāthā-s, as the six Ḍākinī-s in one of its maṇḍala-s. It also identifies one of the Kālī-s in its Kālī-krama-nyāsa with Ḍākinī (c.f. the comparable identification in the Bauddha Sarvatathāgata-tattva-saṃgraha, where Cāmuṇḍā upon “vajrification’’ becomes Vajrakālī who is also called Vajraḍākinī).

Thus, based on the Kaula texts, we can infer that:  
1. Right at the base of the Kaula tradition, there was a group of 6/7 goddesses who were associated with the dhātu-s (“tissues”; Dhātunāthā-s), which included Ḍākinī, Śākinī, and Lākinī, who were already known in the earlier Brahmayāmala. As these deities are sometimes referred to as the six Ḍākinī-s, we posit that they were part of the original Ḍākinī pantheon that might have been inherited from the Ḍākinī-tantra-s. Their connection to the “darker’’ side of the Yoginī-s, i.e., those who suck the essences of their victims, might have been directly linked to their role as Dhātunāthā-s. Indeed, in abhicārika contexts they suck out or destroy the corresponding dhātu-s of enemies. On the other hand, the Mahāvrata of the Brahmayāmala suggests how they could have evolved into Dhātunāthā-s in the context of entering and residing in various parts of the body of the successful sādhaka.

2\. It appears that in the course of the evolution of the Kaula tradition, they were connected to the cakra stationed along the Kulapatha. It is unclear if this was an innovation in the Kaula tradition or if it too was inherited from the ancient Ḍākinī-tantra-s.

3\. Ḍākinī was specifically identified with the svara-s of the Varṇamāla and sometimes seen as a group of 16 Ḍākinī-s, one for each vowel. It is possible this too was an ancient feature inherited from the Ḍākinī-tantra-s.

Finally, we suspect there might be another text that could potentially have a link to the old Ḍākinī-tantra-s. Among the manuscripts of the Dharmartha Trust (धर्मार्थ ट्रस्ट) at Raghunath Temple, Jammu, digitized by eGangotri is one bearing the title Ḍākinī-kalpa. However, this manuscript is a composite of 6 different texts whose only commonality is some relationship to Hindu temporal (based on astral time) medicine. They belong to very different time periods. For example, text-1 is a very late Apabhramsha-Sanskrit hybrid text. Of these, the second text is the genuine Ḍākinī-kalpa and probably contains rare surviving material from the old Ḍākinī-tantra-s. Its colophon bears the name: Tithi-Ḍākinī-kalpa. The text is in rather defective Sanskrit, compounded by scribal errors.

We have made an electronic copy of the same with some restorations, but we have not attempted major emendations of the defective language. The text has 15 short sections corresponding to each tithi. There is a Ḍākinī corresponding to each tithi (given in the table below), who evidently seizes the victim with a disease whose symptoms are listed in the text. This is followed by a description of the bali for the Ḍākinī, along with the time and place for the ritual. Each section ends with a mantra to the Ḍākinī to relieve the victim of the affliction. A second name of the Ḍākinī is provided in the mantra. The 4 mantra-s (the first three and the 5th) have names identical to or related to the names of Māṭṛ-s, indicating the ancient link between them and the Ḍākinī-s. The general structure of the text, the bali-s and the mantra-s is reminiscent of the Bhūta-tantra material, invoking Khaḍgarāvaṇa for similar medical relief. This favors an archaic origin for these mantra-s in the old Ḍākinī-tantra-s. The names of some of the Ḍākinī-s match human females of particular castes. This association is also seen in the Śaiva Yoginī tradition in the Hindu world and among the Ḍākinī-s of the Bauddha-s. This text combines the malevolent, seizing nature of the Ḍākinī with their protective nature, suggesting a possible bridge between their two expressions in tradition.
