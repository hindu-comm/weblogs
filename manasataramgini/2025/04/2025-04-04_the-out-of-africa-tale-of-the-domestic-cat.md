The out of Africa tale of the domestic cat

*The cat is a lion when catching a mouse,*  
*but it is a mouse when on the battlefield of the leopard*

-translation into English of a verse of some poet from Islamic Iran

Molecular divergence estimates suggest that all the diversity of cats we see today, from panthers to house cats, has emerged in just the past 10-11 million years – coeval with the radiation of the African great ape clade that includes Homo. Today, domestic cats are estimated at almost 1 billion in number and are present nearly everywhere where humans are present. However, unlike the dog, which might have spread with the early human populations out of Africa, we can say with considerable certainty that the cat was domesticated well after the dog. Nevertheless, its story still remains hazy. The extant cats show a fundamental split into the big cat clade (*Neofelis*, *Panthera*: Snow leopard+Tiger, Lion+jaguar+leopard) and the small cat clade. The small cat clade contains seven major lineages: 1. The Bay cat-like; 2. the caracal-golden cat-serval; 3; the American cats (ocelot-margay); 4. Lynx-bobcat; 5. puma-jaguarundi-cheetah; 6. leopard-cat-fishing cat; 7. Black-footed cat-domestic cat lineage The most recent molecular evidence from nuclear genomes indicates that the domestic cat Felis catus was derived from the African wildcat (*Felis lybica lybica*). Within clade 7, the domestic cat-*F.l.lybica* sub-clade is a sister group to another sub-clade with three lineages, the Asiatic Wild cat (*F.l. ornata*), the Chinese mountain cat (*F.bieti*) and the European wild cat (*F.silvestris*): ((*F.l.ornata, F.bieti*), *F.silvestris*). While *F.l.lybica* is termed the African wild cat, in addition to North Africa, it is/was distributed across parts of West Asia, parts of Anatolia and Cyprus. Hence, it remains unclear as to where exactly in its range it was domesticated. Further, in Anatolia, it seems to have overlapped in range with the European wild cat and hybridized with it.

Until recently, there were two major competing theories for cat domestication:  
1. It was domesticated somewhere between 11600 and 9000 years before present in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic of West Asia and Anatolia. In support of this hypothesis, a combined cat-human burial from around 9500 YBP from Cyprus has been invoked. However, there is no convincing evidence that the cat in question was a domesticated rather than a wild specimen of *F.l.lybica*. The available archaeological evidence primarily supports the hunting/butchery of cats during the Neolithic, which could simply imply their exploitation for food and fur rather than their domestication. Further, hybridization between *F.l.lybica* and *F.silvestris* has been mistaken for the early spread of domestic cats from Anatolia.

2\. The alternative hypothesis has posited Pharaonic Egypt as the place where cats were domesticated, sometime between 5700 and 4000 YBP. This hypothesis is better supported by the extensive imagery and funerary remains of what appear to be clearly domesticated cats from Egyptian archaeological sites. This went hand in hand with the development of the cult of the goddess Bastet, who started off as a therocephalic deity with a lioness head. In parallel with the domestication of the cat in Egypt, she evolved into a cat-headed goddess in the subsequent reflexes of the cult.

Gonur Depe cat terracotta

In the East, a single clay image of what has been interpreted as a domestic cat has been found in the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) site of Gonur Depe, Turkmenistan (\~4400-3600 YBP). However, the BMAC sites lack cat bones making this find singular and exceptional. Notably, the archaeologists who reported this feline terracotta believed that it was morphologically distinct from the coeval Egyptian domestic cats. This raises the question of whether the cat was independently domesticated in the BMAC or the closely connected Harappan civilization to its south in the Indian subcontinent.

The story of cats in the Harappan civilization is simultaneously scanty and complex. In 1936, following his study of the faunal remains at Harappa, B. Prashad claimed that the rare small felid bones he recovered at the site were the earliest attestation of the domestic cat in the subcontinent (\~4300-4200 YBP). Excavations reported in 1980 from Chanhu-daro reported a Harappan brick with footprints of a cat supposedly chased by a dog. The report on faunal remains from the southern Harappan site, Rojdi in Gujarat, records a few felid bones comparable to those from Harappa. Similarly, a few small felid bones have also been reported in the excavations at Rakhigarhi in Haryana. Thus, the presence of small felids in the vicinity of settlements is attested across the length and breadth of the Harappan horizon, even if rather scarcely. However, unlike the three panthers (tiger, leopard, lion) and the cheetah, and unlike the BMAC figurine, there are no convincing Harappan image representations of small cats. Further, in our estimate, none of the small felid remains are diagnostic of *F.catus* as opposed to the closely related *F.l.ornata* (Asiatic Wild Cat). Thus, all the Harappan cat remains could simply be *F.l.ornata*, which, until its recent decline, was widely sighted across the ex-Harappan zone. Some of these bones could even be that of a Jungle Cat (F.chaus; a basal member of clade 7) that is widely distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and much of Asia (including the BMAC zone and regions between the Black and Caspian Seas). Both these cats have been known to frequently inhabit the fringes of human settlements, and *F.l.ornata* even interbreeds with feral *F.catus*. Thus, their presence at the Harappan sites would not be entirely surprising.

Late sources (e.g., Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus) indicate that the Egyptians prevented their cats from leaving their borders and even had agents to repatriate them if they were smuggled outside Egypt. If this attitude had been present since the early days of cat domestication, it is unlikely that the Egyptians exported any cats to Harappans or the linked BMAC peoples. Hence, in conclusion, it is rather dubious if the Harappans had acquired any Egyptian domestic cats. Further, the absence of small cat imagery suggests that these (unlike dogs or panthers and cheetahs) were unimportant to Harappans. Hence, it is more likely that their settlements were occasionally visited by Asiatic Wild cats and Jungle Cats rather than having domesticates dwelling within them. Nevertheless, the material depiction of what looks like a cat in the BMAC site of Gonur Depe does leave open the possibility for some kind of “zoo” type maintenance of wild cats in the region encompassing BMAC and the Harappan zone. It also remains unclear if the scanty cat bones in Harappa indicate their exploitation for skins.

There is no linguistic evidence that the proto-Indo-Europeans were aware of a small cat. The Ṛgveda abundantly knows of the lion, with a rare mention of the leopard (within a name); however, it fails to mention a tiger or a small cat (unlike dogs). Similarly, there is no mention of the cat in any of the early Iranian texts. The later saṃhitā-s, namely those of the Yajurveda and the Atharvaveda, are aware of both small cats, likely the cheetah and multiple panthers (lion, tiger and leopard). This potentially indicates a geographical shift into and in the vicinity of the subcontinent in the later phase of the collation of these texts. The word for the small cat in the YV saṃhitā-s and Sāmaveda-brāhmaṇa-s is vṛṣadaṃśa, and in the AV is the related vṛṣadatī. While it is not explicit from the context of the usage or their etymology if these words originally meant a cat, the later tradition (including the Mahābhārata) definitely sees them as such:  
otur biḍālo mārjāro vṛṣadaṁśaka ākhubhuk \| (Amarakośa).

The Amarakośa gives two other words for a cat that are completely unattested in the earlier layers of the Sanskrit language: otu and biḍāla (biḍālī \> Apabhramśa: billī). These indeed appear to be non-Aryan loans (despite traditional grammarian explaining otu as: avati gṛham ākhubhyaḥ \|) that might have been acquired from Harappan or more local hunter-gatherer languages. These indeed suggest that the Indo-Aryans encountered local Indian populations that were already familiar with small cats, even if they were not domesticated. The word biḍāla and its Apabhramśa successors became widespread and was applied to the para-Vedic cat-faced Kaumāra goddess Biḍālī.

The saṃhitā-s and brāhmaṇa-s are rather opaque about the nature of the vṛṣadaṃśa. However, in the YV tradition, it is one of the sacrificial animals in the Aśvamedha alongside the wolf (vṛka) and the halīkṣṇa (interpreted in later tradition as a cheetah or caracal; Raghuvira interpreted it as a lynx, which is also possible). These associations favor vṛṣadaṃśa being a wild cat. Consistent with this, in AV 1.18.4, vṛṣadatī occurs in a list of clearly undomesticated (potentially disease-bearing) animals with obscure names. In the Sāmaveda Brāhmaṇa-s, the vṛṣadaṃśa’s cough- or sneeze-like vocalization (ās) inspired Kaṇva to use it as the nidhana of his eponymous sāman (kaṇvo vā etat sāmarte nidhanam apaśyat \| sa na pratyatiṣṭhat \| sa vṛṣadaṃśasyāṣiti kṣuvata upāśṛṇot \| sa tad eva nidhanam apaśyat \| tato vai sa pratyatiṣṭhad yad etat sāma bhavati pratiṣṭhityai \|\| Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa version). This was likely a record of chuffing or hissing vocalizations common among multiple small wild cats, including the caracal. Thus, scanty as the data is in these Vedic texts, there is little evidence in them supporting a reference to a domestic cat.

The latest Vedic layer of the gṛhyasūtra-s (Baudhāyana and Vaikhānasa) makes two references to cats that are quite different from those in the earlier layers. First, the word used is mārjāra (rather than vṛṣadamśa which became otiose), whose successor words continue to be used in modern Apabhramśa-s (e.g., Marathi and Konkani):

maṇḍūka-sarpa-mūṣika-mārjāra+antarāgamane prāyaścittaṃ pañcahotāraṃ cānukhyāṃ ca juhoti \|\| (BGS 4.9.9)

go-varāha-śva-sarpa-maṇḍūka-mārjārādyair gamane tat padāni+idaṃ viṣṇur iti prokṣya vaiṣṇavaṃ raudraṃ ca paristaraṇādi sambhārāṇāṃ dāhe bhede cchede nāśe ca tat-tat sthāne saṃyojya mindāhutī dvir āvartya juhuyāt \|
(in VGS 1.6.1)

Both these gṛhyasūtra statements refer to the expiation to be performed if an animal passes between the ritualist and the fire altar or the teacher and the student. The BGS lists a frog, snake, mouse and a cat. The VGS list names a cow, hog, dog, snake, frog, and cat. Given that this specifically refers to domestic settings, the mārjāra in this context is most likely a domestic cat. This, in turn, implies that the domestic cat was present in India in the latest phase of the Vedic period. To better understand this situation, we next turn to the itihāsa-s, whose compilation might have overlapped with the late Vedic layers. The words mārjāra and biḍāla are both found in the Rāmāyaṇa. However, all occurrences of these words that can be reliably traced back to the last common ancestor of the extant Rāmāyaṇa recensions appear to refer to wild cats. Thus, it may be concluded that the words biḍāla and mārjāra were not always used for a domestic cat and were likely originally used for a wild version.

The Mahābhārata offers a more complex picture with several narratives featuring wild cats under the nouns mārjāra and biḍāla. The most notable of these is a proto-Pañcatantra type tale of the cat Lomaśa and the mouse Palita narrated by Bhīṣma to emperor Yudhiṣṭhira in the Śāntiparvan. The cat was caught in the snares of a caṇḍāla (“AASI”-ancestry-rich hunter-gatherer). The mouse, sensing the meat used as the bait, also found itself in the same trap as the cat. Seeing the mouse localized therein, two further predators, a mongoose and an owl, started eying it as prey. The mouse then made a pact with the cat that it would sever the bonds of the snare and let it escape if the cat would let the mouse hide beneath it to evade the other two predators. The cat did its part in shielding the mouse, and the owl and mongoose retreated from the scene. The cat then called on the mouse to keep its part of the deal. The mouse slowly got to work, gnawing away at the bonds. The cat kept urging the mouse to speed up, but it did not and snapped the final bonds only when they saw the terrible, dark caṇḍāla arriving with his weapon. The cat bounded, fled up the tree and hid even as the mouse made his way into his burrow. After the caṇḍāla left, the cat offered lasting friendship with the mouse and invited the latter to be his friend and object of worship. However, the mouse wisely informed the cat that friend and foe was a matter of circumstance and that it would be bad policy for him to blindly seek the cat’s friendship now that their situations were different. The cat Lomaśa in this tale is explicitly described as dwelling in the forest and feeding on birds – clearly, it refers to a wild cat.

Another notable proto-Pañcatantra type tale in the Mbh is that of the deceitful cat narrated in the Udyogaparvan when Ūlūka was sent as an emissary to the Pāṇḍu-s. It is said to have been alluded to by Prahlāda, the king of the Asura-s, when he was conquered by the Deva-s. Here, a cat started to feign asceticism and saintliness to fool his prey, the birds and the mice. Conned by the cat, the mice invited him to be their protector. Putting on a show of reluctance, the cat finally took over this duty, even as the mice styled him their uncle. The cat started feeding on the befooled mice and growing in vigor. The mice started to wonder why he was growing in strength even as their numbers were dwindling. Finally, an elderly mouse observed that the feces of the cat was full of hair – not something one would expect if, like an ascetic, it was feeding on roots and fruits. Realizing that they had been duped, the mice fled the place. This tale might be the first implicit recognition of rodents being paradoxically attracted to cats under the influence of *Toxoplasma* infection. In any case, this tale appears to play out in a sylvan setting on the banks of the Gaṅgā, again suggesting a wild cat.

In contrast to these references, there are others in the Mbh that indicate the domestication of a cat, albeit with contradictory attitudes. In the Sabhāparvan, Duryodhana compares Vidura to a cat that harms its own caregiver: mārjāravat poṣakaṃ copahaṃsi \| This is likely a variation on the persistent trope that the cat is less faithful to its owner than a dog. In any case, this is a clear allusion to a domestic cat. A second reference from the Anuśāsanaparvan, however, presents the domestic cat in a positive light. In response to a query to the Pramatha-s by the ṛṣi-s regarding how to avoid malevolent entities, they are given the following prescription:

yasya cāgnir gṛhe nityaṃ divā rātrau ca dīpyate ।  
tarakṣoś carma daṃṣṭrāś ca tathaiva giri-kacchapaḥ ॥  
ājya-dhūmo biḍālaś ca cchāgaḥ kṛṣṇo ‘tha piṅgalaḥ ।  
yeṣām etāni tiṣṭhanti gṛheṣu gṛhamedhinām ।  
tāny adhṛṣyāṇy agārāṇi piśitāśaiḥ sudāruṇaiḥ ॥

The following can prevent the entry of fierce piśāca-s into their respective houses:  
In whose house the ritual fire burns day and night; who keeps the pelt and teeth of a hyena; who keeps a Tricarinate hill turtle (*Melanochelys tricarinata*); who keeps a ritual fire smoldering with fire offerings, a cat, and a sheep of blackish-yellow color.

This also brings to mind the peculiar rites using both a dead and live animal called a pakṣa-biḍāla specified by the Vaiṣṇavī-tantra incorporated into the Kālikā purāṇa. We believe this is simply a domestic cat (as in pakṣa= house and biḍāla= cat). This specification might simply be to distinguish the domestic cat from the wild ones, which were also known to the Hindus of that age. With regard to the live animal, the rite goes thus:

mūrdhni pakṣa-biḍālasya hastaṃ dattvā śata-trayam ।  
vaiṣṇavī-tantra-mantraṃ tu japtvā taṃ sthāpayed gṛhe ॥

taṃ viḍālaṃ tu yā paśyen malinī vanitā suta ।  
nāputrā sā bhavitrī tu kadācid api bhairava ॥

tādṛk pakṣa-biḍālas tu yasya tiṣṭhati mandire ।  
mṛtāpatyāpi tad gehe jīvatputrā prajāyate ॥

The ritualist, having placed his hand on the head of a domestic cat and having performed japa of the mantra from the Vaiṣṇavī-tantra for a count of 300, stations the cat in his house. My son, if a menstruating woman sees that cat, she will certainly never be issueless, o Bhairava. If such a cat is stationed in a house, even if children have died in that house, a \[woman\] will birth living sons (c.f., the cat-associated goddess of the pediatric Kaumāra tradition).

Thus, a survey of the early Hindu tradition indicates that while the earliest texts have scant evidence of domestic cats, the later ones consistently suggest their existence, with a transition happening in the late Vedic-epic period. The open question is whether these early Indian domestic cats were independent domesticates, Egyptian imports, hybrids or domesticates inspired by the historic contacts with Egypt.

In this regard, a recent genetic study on cat domestication by De Martino et al. is of considerable interest \[Footnote 1\]. This work has essentially clarified the spread of the domestic cat to Europe. By studying 87 ancient and modern cat genomes, the authors found that domestic cats did not arrive in Europe with the Neolithic farmers spreading out of Anatolia, thereby falsifying the first of the above-proposed hypotheses for their origins. Instead, they were introduced rather late, likely from North Africa, within the last 2000 years. Additionally, an earlier human-assisted introduction of African wildcats from Northwest Africa sometime between 3000-2200 YBP gave rise to the current wild cat populations in Sardinia and Corsica. The authors posit that this transport of African wild cats to Sardinia and Corsica could have been mediated by the Phoenicians, their Carthaginian successors or the pre-imperial Romans. In contrast, the earliest domestic cat (F.catus) they found in Europe was dated to 50BCE-80 CE from Mautern, in Austria. Subsequently, they found several domestic cats at imperial Roman military sites in Austria and Serbia. Hence, they propose that the imperial Roman army played a key role in transmitting cats from Egypt to Europe. This is likely to have happened in the wake of the Roman assault on and subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt, beginning with Julius Caesar’s attack on Alexandria.

This late transmission of domestic cats to Europe, with evidence supporting Roman involvement, is at odds with the situation in India, the ex-BMAC zone and possibly East Asia. Contrary to White Indological opinion, we believe that the gṛhyasūtra-s and itihāsa-s considerably predate the inferred Roman trafficking of domestic cats to Europe. If this were indeed the case, then it would suggest that there was either one or more independent domestications of the cats in the East (including India) or an independent transmission from Egypt. Of course, both could have happened, given the long history of Indo-Egyptian contacts preceding the Roman age, along with hybridization. Given this, we believe that a more detailed genomic study of Indian and other Central/East Asian cats is a major desideratum to untangle the domestic feline story in that part of the world.
