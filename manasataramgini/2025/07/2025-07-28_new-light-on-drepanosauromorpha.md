New light on Drepanosauromorpha

In 1935, the fossil hunter Louis Grauvogel began discovering an enormous cache of fossils in the quarries of the Grès à Voltzia of the Vosges in the disputed Lorraine region between France and Germany. One day in May 1939, he discovered the two mysterious skeletons of a reptile species whose significance he entirely failed to grasp. He felt one of them might be a fish fin. Yet others thought that this specimen was a fossil of an insect wing, but did not examine it closely. 32 years later, the second specimen was correctly identified by J.-C. Gall as a reptile of an indeterminate genus in his study of fossils from Alsace and Lorraine, but he did not show any further interest in it. Grauvogel’s collection was passed on to his paleobotanist daughter and was finally acquired by the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart (SMNS), where these fossils were prepared and studied. Further, they identified 80 other isolated remains from Grauvogel’s collection that turned out to be integumentary fragments of the same taxon. This animal was finally described this month by Spiekman and colleagues as Mirasaura grauvogeli – one of the most remarkable, recently described fossil reptiles.

Through the 1960s, the Russian paleontologist A.G. Sharov explored the Madygen Formation of Kyrgyzstan, discovering a wealth of fossil insects from the Triassic. In the course of these expeditions, he also discovered some remarkable fossil reptiles from the same age. In 1965, he discovered a mysterious flying reptile with a wing membrane supported by its hind legs and tail. This was described in 1971 as Podopteryx mirabilis (subsequently renamed as Sharovipteryx mirabilis). In 1969, he discovered another remarkable reptile characterized by a series of unique, long, hockey-stick-shaped, superficially feather-like integumentary appendages projecting dorsally along its back. He described it in 1970, naming it Longisquama. In his original description, Sharov considered it a stem archosaur as he believed it had an antorbital fenestra in the cranium and a mandibular fenestra in the lower jaw, both features being diagnostic of the clade today known as Archosauriformes. While Longisquama remained poorly known outside the Russian sphere of influence during the Cold War years, it became the center of much debate in the subsequent period. First, new studies suggested that the fenestrae identified by Sharov could not be confirmed upon reexamination. Second, while some workers claimed that its unique dorsal integumentary structures were feathers, others confirmed that they only superficially resembled them. They had a central structure like the rachis of a feather, but were not branched like the real feathers of dinosaurs and pterosaurs. However, by then, peculiar dinosaur feathers had been discovered, which were flat, band-like, unbranched structures, further blurring the distinction. Thus, Longisquama became one of the most enigmatic reptiles, both in terms of its phylogenetic affinities and interpretation of its integumentary structures until the discovery of Mirasaura grauvogeli.

In another parallel track, in 1980, Giovanni Pinna described a remarkable reptile, Drepanosaurus, from the Italian Zorzino Limestone Formation. In the same year, Calzavara, Muscio, and Wild described yet another enigmatic reptile, Megalancosaurus from the same formation. Like with Longisquama, Megalancosaurus was originally believed to have an antorbital fenestra and hence thought to be an archosaur; however, this observation was later falsified. These animals had bizarre morphological features that were hitherto unknown in other reptiles. Over the years, several related reptiles were described from Italy and subsequently from multiple sites in the USA by several researchers (e.g., Silvio Renesto). This clade of small reptiles (size no more than 50 cm) was termed the Drepanosauromorpha, and each of the better preserved of them exhibits one or more distinctive features (Figure 1):

Figure 1. Drepanosaurs. Modified from Renesto et al (DOI: [https://doi.org/10.54103/2039-4942/19176](https://doi.org/10.54103/2039-4942/19176))

1\. Hypuronector: Has an unprecedented deep, paddle-shaped tail with extremely elongated chevrons or hemal arches on its caudal vertebrae. The functional significance of such a tail was a mystery at the time of its discovery.

2\. Vallesaurus: Its most distinctive feature is a hypertrophied digit-1 on the foot, forming a large opposable thumb. This digit is characterized by a massive metatarsal followed by a hook-shaped hallux, which is clearly selected for gripping. The remaining toes, forming the rest of the foot, end in curved claw-bearing phalanges, unlike the hallux. Additionally, the end of the tail is curved like a question mark.

3\. Megalancosaurus: The skull of this drepanosaur is strikingly bird-like in profile, resulting in earlier workers considering it an archosaur. However, it lacks the diagnostic fenestration of the archosaurs. Both its hands and feet show opposable digits, suggesting adaptations for gripping. While the type species (M. preonensis) has an opposable toe comparable to Vallesaurus, its structure is distinct in terms of the form of the metatarsal and the hallux. Moreover, it appears to be present in only a subset of the specimens, and the versions without this opposable thumb have been considered a different species. While the tip of its tail is curved like that of Vallesaurus, the terminal caudal vertebrae have fused completely to form a “tail claw”. Strikingly, the chevrons or hemal arches of the caudal vertebrae are elongated, resulting in a deep tail reminiscent of Hypuronector, but are morphologically distinct: unlike in Hypuronector, they are anteroposteriorly wide and distally forked until the fourth-fifth caudal vertebra. Thereafter, the forks meet each other to form a peculiar drop-shaped fenestra.

4\. Drepanosaurus: Like Megalancosaurus, it bears a “tail claw” at the end of its curved tail. The chevrons of its caudal vertebrae are elongated, but only the first two bear the forking/fenestration seen in Megalancosaurus. While it lacks the opposable thumb or hypertrophied hallux typical of Megalanosaurus or Vallesaurus, it has a remarkable, hypertrophied ungual supporting a massive claw with a prominent dorsal keel on the second digit. The third ungual, while also hypertrophied, is nowhere comparable to the former. The forearm also appears to be considerably modified with an unusual, broad, blade-shaped ulna. Drepanosaurus was the first drepanosaur to be described with an unusual ungual claw. Since then, three American taxa, Skybalonyx, Ancistronychus and Unguinychus onyx have been described based on massive, isolated ungual claws that indicate they are drepanosaurs but have distinct morphologies.

Figure 2. Kyrgyzsaurus (From Alifanov et al., Paleontological Journal, 2011, Vol. 45, No. 6, pp. 639–647).

5\. Kyrgyzsaurus (Figure 2): This reptile was described from the Madygen formation as a genus coeval with Longisquama. While its skeletal anatomy is not preserved in the best state, like Longisquama, it is remarkable for soft tissue preservation in the form of clear skin imprints. The nature of these imprints suggests that it bore a tall integumentary crest on its skull roof, with a prominent supraorbital skin shelf comparable to that of the chameleon Brookesia superciliaris. Further, the skin impressions point to a throat sac comparable to that seen in the chameleon Chamaeleo. On its torso, the scales were reinforced with small osteoderms.

The better-preserved skeletons indicate that many of the drepanosaurs possessed a “hump” in the anterior thoracic region just above the pectoral girdle (Figure 1). In Hypuronector, this hump is muted and primarily marked by the elongated neural spines of the thoracic vertebrae. The situation might be similar in Kyrgyzsaurus, which has clearly tall anterior thoracic vertebral neural spines relative to the upstream cervical vertebrae. In Vallesaurus, Megalancosaurus and Drepanosaurus, the anterior thoracic vertebrae over the pectoral girdle are not only tall but also show antero-posteriorly expanded distal apices. Further, the apices of those just above the girdle may also be fused into a single broad table. Strikingly, in these taxa, just above this fused structure and articulating with it, is a large, neomorphic, dermal ossification, the supraneural, which provides a bony support for a large hump. Studies by Castiello and colleagues indicated that the vertebral portion of the hump provided an attachment surface for a series of pectoral and cervical muscles that probably allowed for energetic movements of the arms and the neck during locomotion or predation. However, these reconstructions still left the role of the supraneural ossification unclear.

It is against this backdrop that the description of Mirasaura grauvogeli suddenly revolutionized the understanding of the true diversity of Drepanosauromorpha. Ever since Sharov’s original proposal of Longisquama as a stem archosaur was overturned, its relationships have been a major open question in early reptilian phylogeny. In 2004, Senter grouped the drepanosaurs with the enigmatic Longisquama. However, subsequent researchers had disputed this relationship. The description of Mirasaura showed that it was unambiguously related to Longisquama – importantly, it shared with the former its most diagnostic feature – a dorsal crest of long, superficially feather-like integumentary structures. The integumentary structures of Mirasaura are similar in having a central rachis and in being systematically curved at the distal end. Further, the blade-like anteroposterior expansion of this structure shows a comparable corrugation in both Longisquama and Mirasaura. This establishes that while these structures are not feathers, they have evidently evolved certain features comparable to them. Interestingly, by microscopically examining the fossilized melanosomes preserved in these structures, the authors found that they were again similar to those in feathers rather than reptilian scales or mammalian hair. This raises further questions about how this structure evolved to mimic feathers in more than one respect.

Figure 3. Skeletal reconstruction and phylogeny of Mirasaura and Longisquama ([https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09167-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09167-9)).

Importantly, a phylogenetic analysis including Longisquama and Mirasaura unambiguously recovered them as members of Drepanosauromorpha, as a sister group of the crown clade containing the drepanosaurs with the supraneural ossification in the hump (Figure 3). The only drepanosaur more primitive than them in the tree was Hypuronector (Kyrgyzsaurus was not included in the analysis). Notably, the Anisian age (earliest Middle Triassic, 247.2-242 million years ago) of Mirasaura makes it older than Longisquama (235-225 million years ago) and also any other Drepanosauromorpha. Considering the last known member of the clade, Avicranium, from the latest Triassic, it is now clear that the Drepanosauromorpha lasted for at least 45 million years and diversified in the early Triassic. In addition to the specific features shared with Longisquama, Mirasaura also shares several features with the other drepanosaurs. First, it has a pronounced hump formed by anteroposteriorly expanded thoracic vertebrae with some degree of dorsal elongation and a convex curvature of the vertebral column just above the pectoral girdle. Second, the skull with a superficially bird-like or pterosaur-like form resembles other drepanosaurs like Megalancosaurus and Avicranium, particularly in its dome-shaped skull-roof and forward-facing large eyes indicative of acute binocular vision. It has an elongated, tapering snout with jaws lacking teeth anteriorly and having slender, pointed teeth posteriorly (Figure 4). The authors propose that this might have played a role in probing small invertebrate prey in crevices.

Figure 4. Skull of Mirasaura ([https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09167-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09167-9)).

Taken together, it suggests that the Drepanosauromorpha were visual reptiles that engaged in visual displays and had a variety of specialized adaptations for procuring prey. The description of Mirasaura establishes that, both in it and Longisquama, the feather-like integumentary blades formed an unpaired dorsal, median crest and not a paired aerodynamic structure. Such a frond-like crest could have lent itself to either camouflage among plant leaves or as a potential display structure during sexual, intra-specific competitive or threatening encounters. In Mirasaura, the anterior part of the crest is associated with the hump and accentuated by it. Interestingly, Renesto had observed poorly preserved integumentary remains in the hump region of Drepanosaurus and proposed that they might represent structures as in Longisquama. While this was ignored by most workers, the discovery of Mirasaura vindicates this proposal. More generally, we posit that the hump helped accentuate integumentary display structures across Drepanosauromorpha. In the derived clade with the dermal supraneural bone, we propose that it helped support muscle attachments for raising and lowering the integumentary structures associated with the hump as part of displays with potential signaling roles. The peculiar structures in other drepanosaurs point to a diversity of potential display mechanisms. For example, the deep tail in Hypuronector could be one, while the crest, the supraocular shelf and throat sac in Kyrgyzsaurus were another. The authors of the Mirasaura study also state that the skull roof of Avicranium was highly encephalized and bore a large endocast relative to body size. This raises the possibility that drepanosaurs had the neural processing capacity to go with the proposed visual acuity and displays.

The last point might also relate to supporting diversified predatory capabilities. Most well-preserved drepanosaurs show a suite of morphological features associated with an arboreal habit, viz., gripping claws (a feature also seen in Mirasaura), grasping with opposable hands and feet, and a curved tail sometimes tipped with a tail claw. The potential encephalization might help with navigation in three-dimensional space. However, the skull and the forelimbs reveal other adaptations: On one hand, the bird-like profile of the skull suggests probing or pecking to procure food. On the other, the manual heavy claw seen in forms like Drepanosaurus suggests breaking of insect nests similar to the extant giant anteater. Interestingly, some workers, based on Principal Component analysis of claw dimensions, have proposed that the fragmentary drepanosaurs, like Skybalonyx, might have used them for digging in the ground.

One of the outstanding enigmas regarding the drepanosaurs is their phylogenetic position. When they were poorly studied, some forms, like Longisquama and Megalancosaurus, were believed to be archosaurs with a bearing on the origin of birds. However, the description of Mirasaura completely negates these claims. The drepanosaurs possess none of the diagnostic features characterizing the clade Archosauriformes and are thus not closely related to dinosaurs and pterosaurs.

However, their relationships within Reptilia (Sauropsida) have been in flux. Before we discuss that, let us orient ourselves with a brief look at the current state of early reptile phylogeny. The crown amniotes unambiguously split up into two major clades, as recognized early on by DMS Watson: the Panmammalian or synapsid clade on one side and the Reptile or sauropsid clade on the other. However, the earliest members of the two clades remain entirely unknown or murky at best. Until recently, it was thought that the crown amniotes originated in the Late Carboniferous, as indicated by the fossils of the stem reptile (sauropsid) Hylonomus from the Bashkirian age (323.2-315.2 Ma) and the stem mammal (synapsid) Archaeothyris from the Early Moscovian age (315.2-307 Ma). This was also consistent with the earliest footprint evidence for these clades from the same period. However, the recent discovery of sauropsid clade footprints from the Snowy Plains Formation of Victoria, Australia, securely dated to the early Tournaisian (358.9-346.7 Ma), completely changes the timeline. This indicates that the basal split in the crown amniotes happened latest at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (358.9 Ma) or even in the Famennian age of the Late Devonian (372.2-358.9 Ma). Thus, we have a long history of early reptiles that is murky in the fossil record. In this intervening period, we have the Polish Notalacerta footprints from the Serpukhovian age (330.9-323.2 Ma) made by a Hylonomus-like stem reptile, confirming the presence of sauropsids despite the rarity of body fossils.

In terms of body fossils, it is becoming increasingly clear that one of the earliest branching reptile (sauropsid) clades is Recumbirostra (many of the former microsaurs), which underwent a great radiation in the Carboniferous, giving rise to a diverse array of morphs, including those with a snake-like form. This was followed by the successful radiation of the Captorhinomorpha that lasted from some time in the Carboniferous through the Permian. These were followed by the basal lineages like Hylonomus and Paleothyris, which include some of the earliest reptile body fossils. These form successive sister groups to the Diapsida, whose earliest branching clade is represented by animals like Araeoscelis and Petrolacosaurus. The core of Diapsida is believed to be formed by the sister clades of Parareptilia and Neodiapsida. Some recent studies, especially the restudy of an early diapsid, Orovenator, suggest that the varanopids are a sister group of this core of diapsida. Most traditional phylogenies have recovered the varanopids as basal synapsids (stem mammals), indicating the morphological closeness of the basal members of the two amniote clades. However, these findings do emphasize the problematic nature of early Amniote phylogeny. The crown clade of Neodiapsida is Sauria, which is comprised of the Lepidosauromorpha and Archosauromorpha. The saurian stem features several successive sister groups; the most secure among these is a group of diverse African and Madagascan reptiles, the Younginiformes, typified by Youngina, Kenyasaurus, Hovasaurus, Thadeosaurus, and Acerosodontosaurus.

A recent study by Buffa et al reevaluating the skull of the drepanosaur Avicranium found the drepanosaurs to be more basal archosauromorphs nested within Allokotosauria alongside the Triassic Azendohsaurids and Trilophosaurids. This was consistent with earlier studies by Renesto, which also found the drepanosaurs to be archosauromorphs. Another set of studies (e.g., those by Merck, Senter and Pritchard et al) grouped the drepanosaurs, with an enigmatic clade of Permian flying reptiles, the weigeltisaurs (Coelurosauravus, Weigeltisaurus and Rautiania) into a clade known as Avicephala. The weigeltisaurs have lateral thoracic patagial membranes supported by spars formed by a neomorphic group of bones known as the patagials, and their skulls often show a frill with spiky ornamentation. In most of these studies, Avicephala was recovered as a primitive clade of neodiapsid reptiles basal to the clade Sauria, alongside the Younginiformes. In some studies, the weigeltisaurs were joined by another primitive neodiapsid, Claudiosaurus.

The new phylogenetic analysis of reptiles (Figure 3), including Mirasaura and Longisquama, using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods recovered Drepanosauromorpha as basal neodiapsids outside a clade formed by Sauria and Younginiformes. A subset of the maximum parsimony trees recovered Avicephala, uniting Drepanosauromorpha and Weigeltisauria. However, Weigeltisauria formed another clade of basal neodiapsids in most trees at the same level as Drepanosauromorpha. The authors state that the attempt to include Drepanosauromorpha in Archosauromorpha results in much worse trees with their data matrix. Hence, they favor a more primitive position for Drepanosauromorpha. Nevertheless, it should be noted that their tree fails to recover the turtles within Archosauromorpha, a position confirmed by molecular phylogeny, instead placing them in Lepidosauromorpha. This suggests that while drepanosaurs might not be allokotosaurian archosauromorphs, they could still be a group of stem archosauromorphs. At least two recent studies on the timing of radiation of Archosauromorpha have suggested that the split between the crocodile and dinosaur-pterosaur lines of crown archosaurs happened in the Permian itself, probably 260-265 Ma. This implies that earlier branching within Archosauromorpha happened deep in the Permian, probably stretching back to at least 280-270 Ma. Thus, we have a gaping hole in the body fossil record of Archosauromorpha, in turn suggesting that we might be getting several of the relationships early in the history of this clade wrong. In light of this, we would not rule out that drepanosaurs are basal archosauromorphs.

Nevertheless, their early branching position, within Neodiapsida or within Archosauromorpha suggests that feather-like structures of Longisquama, Mirasaura and possibly Drepanosaurus are a case of convergent evolution with the integumentary structures seen in the dinosaur-pterosaur line. Molecular developmental studies have indicated that the feathers, a subset of scales, and the mammalian hairs form from placodes via dermal condensation regulated by Wnt, EDAR, BMP and Shh pathways that were acting similarly in the integument of the ancestral amniote. This pre-adaptation potentially allowed the repeated emergence in amniotes of invaginated versions that gave rise to feathers, hair and even the frond-like appendages of drepanosaurs.
