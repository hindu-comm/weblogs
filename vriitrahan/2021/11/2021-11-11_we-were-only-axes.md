vR^itrahan

न ध्यातं पदम् ईश्वरस्य विधिवत्संसारविच्छित्तये  
स्वर्गद्वारकवाटपाटनपटुर्धर्मोऽपि नोपार्जितः ।  
नारीपीनपयोधरोरुयुगलं स्वप्नेऽपि नालिङ्गितं  
मातुः केवलमेव यौवनवनच्छेदे कुठारा वयम् ॥

We did not meditate on the feet of God  
To cut away the cord of wordly existence  
As had been required of us  
We did not lead lives pious enough  
To be worthy to walk through the gates of heaven,  
Even in our dreams, we did not embrace those pair of wide breasts of
damsels  
We were only axes, cutting down the forests of our mothers youth.  
  
(Bhratrhari, Vairagya Shataka 45)
