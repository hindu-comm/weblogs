vR^itrahan

shriivara in his 16th century zainatara\~Nginii describes how the hindus
were converting to islam in the first few decades of the 1500s and
adopting the customs of the mausala (musalman) and being embarassed of
the religion of their forefathers.

तथाहि वणिजः केचित् स्वाचारं हिन्दुकोचितम्।  
त्यक्त्वा पुरान्तरे चक्रुर् हत्वा गोमांसभक्षणम्॥

“In this manner even, some merchants abandoned their own customs.
Customs which are fit for the hindu people and after having \[killed
some cows\] in the city, they ate their meat”

येनैव पितरो याता येन याताः पितामहाः।  
तद्दर्शने अत्र तत्पुत्रास् त्रपन्ते मौसुलप्रियाः॥

“Their children, who adore the mausala \[mohammedans\] are ashamed of
the religion \[hinduism\] which had been practiced by their fathers and
which had been practiced by their grand-fathers.

प्रत्यब्दं तिथिकार्याणि पुराणोक्तानि कानिचित्।  
विस्मृतानि दुराचारात् कथं न स्युर् दुरापदः॥  
मण्डलेऽस्मिन् दुराचारश् चातुर्वर्ण्ये विराजते।

“Every year, due to their wicked behavior, they forget some of the
rituals & sacred dates that are uttered in the purANa-s. Why then will
they not face misery? In this kingdom terrible customs are now dominant
among the four castes.”
