Bhishma and Zeus

It’s long been theorized that *Bhīṣma* (“the terrible”, for the vow he had taken) *Pitāmaha* (patriarch) is an incarnation of the *Vasu Dyaus*; thus likely cognate to our ancestral PIE Sky Father (*\*Dyḗus ph₂tḗr*). While we can look at many facets of this theorized relationship via the lens of comparative mythology – let us start with the circumstances of the Kuru patriarch’s birth itself. Then, let us compare this to the birth myth of Zeus Pater, King of the Olympians. If there are some similarities, then our hypothesis is reinforced: that the mighty Son of the Ganges is verily a reflux of the ancestral Sky Father. The word Zeus (Proto-Hellenic, \*dzeus) is indeed a linguistic cognate of Dyaus (root: dyu) in Sanskrit; both are nominalizations and vriddhi derivatives of the PIE root (\*dyeu) for the sky, heaven.

We shall assume that people reading this are familiar with the birth stories of both *Bhīṣma* and of Zeus. A short summary nonetheless: Bhishma is the Son of the River Goddess Ganga and the Kaurava Shantanu. He is born the last of eight male children born to the couple. However, Ganga drowns all of the previous seven ones. Then Shantanu has no more and asks her to stop when it is the turn of Bhishma, which she does. At that moment she reveals who she is and leaves him, as he had made the vow of never questioning what she does. The backstory is that the 8 children are the 8 vasus who were cursed for stealing the celestial cow, the Kamadhenu. The Seer Vasiṣṭha curses them to born as humans but says the 8th vasu will liberate them from the curse, though he himself will be cursed to spend a longer time on earth due to his primacy in the theft.  
  
Similarly, Zeus is the son of the Titan Kronos and his sister Rhea. Kronos and Rhea themselves are the children of Ouranos (Uranus; Heaven) and Gaia (Earth). Kronos castrates his own father at the insistence of his mother. However, he is forewarned that just as he overthrew his father, his children will overthrow him. Because of this, he devours all his children the moment they are born; that is, except his last-born Zeus. Rhea gives birth to Zeus on Crete and tricks Kronos into thinking he has devoured him too. Eventually, Zeus grows up and gets Kronos to disgorge his 5 siblings. These 5 siblings:
Demeter,Hestia,Hera,HadesandPoseidon, defeat the Titans in the Titanomachy after which Zeus marries his sister Hera, just like his father.

Many similarities are visible, let’s list them out:

1.  Many siblings are born (8 and 6 respectively), and are killed by one
    of their own parents (Ganga, Kronos). There is infanticide at birth
    itself. 2.  All the victims are sequences of siblings 3.  The last victim is the one that frees his siblings from the
    curse/doom that befell them. 4.  The siblings are killed in the body of their parent (Ganga drowns
    them in her own waters, Kronos eats them and they are inside his
    stomach) 5.  The other parent is extremley upset at this, but says nothing until
    the final sibling is about to be killed. 6.  Temporary period where both surviving siblings are separated from
    their fathers (Ganga takes away Bhishma to educate him, while Rhea
    moves Zeus to Crete to protect him).

Thus, we find incredible homologies in the birth myths of the two celestial figures, which certainly cannot be purely coincidentary. There are a lot of other similarities in the life of Bhishma and Zeus (+Ouranos) as grown ups but we shall look at them in other posts, along with some of the differences. Conclusively, we show the case for *Bhīṣma* and Zeus Pater being homologous variants gains some reputable ground beyond mere linguistic association (Dyaus:Zeus)
