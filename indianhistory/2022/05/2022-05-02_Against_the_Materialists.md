It has been on the back of my mind to write a document of a few pages against Charvaka empiricism. Most pop culture treatment of this school of ancient Indian materialism has been extremley shoddy, both by those who advocate for it (Neo-Charvaks) and those who write against it. Their arguments are generally simple, fideistic and draw from a superficial understanding of epistemology, as they are not well-versed in *Nyāya*: the logico-realist school of Indian philosophy. If they are well versed in Nyāya, they’re often not well versed in the philosophical terminology of English. This is also not something we can expect academic scholars to address, since writing polemical treatises is not part of their oeuvre. Therefore, I spent an hour and a half yesterday when I had some free time and wrote a small document discussing the Charvaka view in detail first, as *pūrvapakṣa*, and then refuting it quite thoroughly.

I hope to make a small and limited contribution to this. On that note, subscribe to my substack below if you haven’t. It’s free *(for now!)*
