# Another verse on the sadāśiva residing atcidambara

Introduction:

Only the first word (எல்லையற்ற/ ऎल्लैयऱ्ऱ /ellaiyaṟṟa) of the below
verse was reverberating in my mind. But even as I decided to go to the
gym nearby and work out, the first word would not leave the
consciousness.

எல்லையற்ற மறைக்கொப்ப நுண்ணிய இனிமிகு துறைனூலதன்

சொல்லைகுற்ற மென்பார் விழியாகும் ஒருவழியார்க்கன்பர்

இல்லைசுற்ற மொருவன் மூவராகுமெழில்மிடறன் முச்சிக்குளிர

தில்லைசிற்ற அம்பலத்தில் எண்தோளர்க்கெண்தோழர் செய்வாரே

ऎल्लैयऱ्ऱ मऱैक्कॊप्प नुण्णिय इऩिमिगु तुऱैऩूलदऩ्  
चॊल्लैकुऱ्ऱ मॆऩ्पार् विऴियागुम् ऒरुवऴियार्क्कऩ्बर्  
इल्लैचुऱ्ऱ मॊरुवऩ् मूवरागुमॆऴिल्मिडऱऩ् मुच्चिक्कुळिर  
तिल्लैचिऱ्ऱ अम्बलत्तिल् ऎण्तोळर्क्कॆण्तोऴर् चॆय्वारे

ellaiyaṟṟa maṟaikkoppa nuṇṇiya iṉimigu tuṟaiṉūladaṉ  
collaikuṟṟa meṉpār viḻiyāgum oruvaḻiyārkkaṉbar  
illaicuṟṟa moruvaṉ mūvarāgumeḻilmiḍaṟaṉ muccikkuḷira  
tillaiciṟṟa ambalattil eṇtōḷarkkeṇtōḻar ceyvārē

Whole English translation:

He who calls flawed the word of the books of the subtle, very sweet
path,\[the books\] which equal the limitless veda; he is not a devotee
of one who, guiding on apath, becomes, \[as if\], an eye /

\[There is only\] one kinsman, one bandhu. In the cidambara temple at
tillai, the eight companions of the eight-shouldered one caused the
top-knotof the one, of a beautiful neck, who becomes the triad, to cool
\[with abhiṣeka\]!! //



More detailed meaning:

**எல்லையற்ற/ellaiyaṟṟa**: Without limit/end, limitless/endless

**மறைக்கொப்ப/maṟaikkoppa**: equaling the veda.

Note: In the śruti, it is said, “anantā vai vedāḥ” (taittirīya brāhmaṇa
3.10.11.4). Such limitless/endless veda; equaling that (in greatness)

**நுண்ணிய/nuṇṇiya**-subtle

**இனிமிகு/iṉimigu**-very sweet/very good

**துறைனூலதன்/tuṟaiṉūlataṉ**-Of those books of thetuṟai (tuṟai here is
referring tośivadharma/siddhānta; the books of thetuṟai are the books
of thesiddhānta path: thesiddhāntaāgama-s)

Note: The word துறை/tuṟai in tamiḻ can be used used in the sense of
dharma. In periyapurāṇam, when describing the purpose of the birth of
the child-saint jñānasambandha, it is said: வேத நெறி தழைத்தோங்க மிகு
சைவத்துறை விளங்க.துறை/tuṟai here means “ford”; as in, a point at which
a river or stream can be crossed or used for taking a bath, etc.
Here,jñānasambandha’s advent is said to have been for the purpose of
the flourishing of the veda dharma and the shining of theśaiva “tuṟai”,
that is śivadharma, the way of thesiddhānta. Additionally, do note that
the ford imagery to describeśaivam (siddhānta) goes well with the
characterization of the five streams (pañcasrotāṃsi), of which
thesiddhānta is one and is, obviously, deemed by thesaiddhāntika-s as
theūrdhvasrotas (the upper stream-i.e. the highest).

tuṟaiṉūl: The book/books of the tuṟai. What are the texts of
thesiddhānta? The siddhānta āgama-s, of course. The āgama-s equal to
the limitless veda.

tuṟaiṉūladaṉ-of those texts of thetuṟai; of those siddhānta āgama-s

**சொல்லைகுற்ற மென்பார்/ collaikuṟṟa meṉpār:**Those who call as flawed
the word/words \[of the aforementioned texts, thesiddhānta āgama-s\]

**விழியாகும் ஒருவழியார்க்கன்பர்இல்லை /viḻiyāgum
oruvaḻiyārkkaṉbarillai:**he (the aforementioned person reviling
theāgama-s) is not a devotee \[or rather, not fit to be a devotee\] of
one who, guiding on apath, becomes, \[as if\], an eye.

Note: Who is the one who guides on a path and becomes, as if, an eye to
the person being guided? Theācārya, of course; he who guides a soul
tośiva.வழியார் **/**vaḻiyār here means the one on/of the path.வழி
**/**vaḻi means way/path. There is a deeper meaning behind the use of
two adjectives to describe a single person (theācārya), and that too,
similar sounding words:vaḻi (path) andviḻi (eye), which will become
apparent towards the end of this article.

**சுற்ற மொருவன் /cuṟṟa moruvaṉ:** One is the kinsman/bandhu.

Note: This refers, of course, to sadāśiva, who is with anātma for all
time, while the soul’s form (it takes when incarnating), his parents,
his friends, his place of birth, his characteristics, etc are changing.
The permanency of the relationship betweensadāśiva and theātma is
indicated here.

**மூவராகுமெழில்மிடறன் /mūvarāgumeḻilmiḍaṟaṉ:**He, of the beautiful
neck, who becomes the triad

Note: The term has to be split as மூவராகும் /mūvarāgum +எழில்மிடறன்
/eḻilmiḍaṟaṉ.mūvar means triad here. mūvarāgum means “becomes the
triad”.eḻilmiḍaṟaṉ means “he of the beautiful neck” (மிடறு / miḍaṟu
means neck)

**முச்சிக்குளிர/muccikkuḷira:**\[cause\] the top-knot of \[the one, of
the beautiful neck, who became the triad\] to cool

This has to be read together with the previous phrase.

**தில்லைசிற்ற அம்பலத்தில் / tillaiciṟṟa ambalattil:**In tillai, in the
cidambara \[temple\]

**எண்தோளர்க்கெண்தோழர் செய்வாரே /eṇtōḷarkkeṇtōḻar ceyvārē:** The eight
companions of the eight-shouldered one will do.

Note: What will they do? They will cause the supremesadāśiva to cool,
from head to foot; all the way from the top-knot on his head. The last
word,செய்வாரே /ceyvārē must be read together
withமுச்சிக்குளிர/muccikkuḷira. So, rearranging, the verbal phrase is
as follows:

முச்சிக்குளிரசெய்வாரே /muccikkuḷiraceyvārē : They will cause his
top-knot to cool \[by performingabhiṣeka with water and other
unguents\].

Why isthe deity described as eight-shouldered here? The term for his
being eight-shouldered comes right from the devāram, where the hallowed
tamiḻ poets describe him as eight-shouldered. The simplest explanation
is that the supreme deity,sadāśiva has five heads, with four heads
facing in the four cardinal directions while the fifth is on top of the
four heads, facing upwards. The two shoulders for each of the four
cardinal faces add up to eight.

Thus ends the literal translation. A hidden meaning has been left behind
for those interested in reading this article till the end.



Now, the obvious question is that who are these eight companions, who
performabhiṣeka tosadāśiva, residing in that pristine temple of
cidambara?

See, there was an inextinguishable urging inside me for the past several
days to write a verse in tamiḻ on the eightvidyeśvara-s. “How can their
names be found in a text written partially in Old Javanese (related to
the Malay of my own homeland,siṁhapurī) but not be found in a single
tamiḻ work of note, especially whendrāviḍadeśa is the only place where
thesiddhānta tradition really thrives?” See
[**here**](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/960619278365085696)
for a note on the presence of saiddhāntika tradition as far as Java.It
seemed rather blameworthy and I sought to rectify what I perceived as a
deficiency.

These are theaṣṭavidyeśvarāḥ and this is a fixed order of their
hierarchical ranks, withananta being the highest of all the
8vidyeśvara-s and second tosadāśiva only, andśikhaṇḍin being the last
of all thevidyeśvara-s.

1\. ananta (infinite, endless, limitless)

2\. sūkṣma (subtle)

3.śivatama/śivottama (most gracious/most auspicious)

4\. ekanetra (Literally, one-eyed, but netra also means leader

5\. ekarudra (one rudra)

6.trimūrti (three forms)

7\. śrīkaṇṭha (beautiful/radiant neck)

8\. śikhaṇḍin (one with aśikhā)

These eight effulgent and exalted beings, though not directly named in
the above verse, have been subtly indicated, without doing violence to
the hierarchical order. See:

எல்லையற்ற / ellaiyaṟṟa (limitless):**ananta**

நுண்ணிய /nuṇṇiya (subtle): **sūkṣma**

இனிமிகு /iṉimigu (very
sweet/good/kind/pleasant)**:shivatama/shivottama**

விழியாகும் ஒரு வழியார்க்கு / viḻiyāgum oru vaḻiyārkku (The guide on the
path who becomes an eye): **ekanetra**(netra means both eye and leader.
The word “oru”, meaning one, is to emphasize the “eka” in ekanetra)

சுற்ற மொருவன் /cuṟṟa moruvaṉ (the kinsman is one):**ekarudra.**This
is in reference to the story from the śatapatha brāhmaṇa from the veda
where prajāpati was abandoned by the deva-s, and only rudra in the form
of manyu remained within him and manifested as hundred-headed,
thousand-eyed form. The singular term “oruvan” here is to emphasize the
“eka” in ekarudra, as “oru” did for ekanetra.

Note: Today, I was struck by an alternative forசுற்ற /cuṟṟa. The word
கொற்றன் / koṟṟaṉ meaning victor. In that case, the reading will beகொற்ற
னொருவன்.

மூவராகும் /mūvarāgum (he who becomes the three): **trimūrti**

எழில்மிடறன் / eḻilmiḍaṟaṉ (he of the beautiful neck): **śrīkaṇṭha**who
is of the beautiful neck.

முச்சி /mucci (top-knot/ śikhā): **śikhaṇḍin**who sports aśikhā.

Thus, all eightvidyeśvara-s have been indicated indirectly. Towards the
completion of the verse, I had an imaginative vision in my mind, where
theeightvidyeśvara-s are performingabhiṣeka to the deity of
cidambara.
