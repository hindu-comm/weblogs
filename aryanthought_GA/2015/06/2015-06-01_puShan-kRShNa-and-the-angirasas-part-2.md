# Pūṣan, Kṛṣṇa and the Āṅgirasas-Part2

**Part 2: Pūṣan, Vāsudeva in the Harivamśa and Bhāgavata, and
Sańkarṣaṇa**

[In the previous
article](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/pu%e1%b9%a3an-k%e1%b9%9b%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87a-and-the-a%e1%b9%85girasas-part-1/ "Pūṣan, Kṛṣṇa and the Aṅgirasas-Part 1"),
we had discussed the possibility of a transference of memes from Pūṣan
to Kṛṣṇa in the Mahābhārata. In this article, we would discuss the
commonalities between Pūṣan and Kṛṣṇa in the Harivamśa and Bhāgavata.

As we had noted in the conclusion of the first part, one of the most
well-known attributes of Pūṣan is his association with cattle. In
several verses of the Rg Veda, mention is made of his function of
guiding the cattle and protecting them

yā te aṣṭrā goopaśāghṛṇe paśusādhanī \|  
tasyāste sumnamīmahe \|\|**6.53.9**

Here, Pūṣan holds an aṣṭrā that is goopaśa (go + opaśa, Cow + tuft). In
my opinion, the “tuft” probably refers to the cow’s tail (the cow’s
“tuft of hair”) which can be interpreted as a goad or whip whose thong
is probably made or, or resembles a cow’s tail. In any case, that is
irrelevant to the matter considered here. A sample of a few more verses
showing Pūṣan

pūṣā ghā anvetu naḥ puṣā rakṣatvarvataḥ \|  
pūṣā vājaṃ sanotu naḥ \|\|**6.54.5**

“May Pūṣan follow our cows; may Pūṣan protect the horses. May Pūṣan
obtain the treasure for us”

ajāśvaḥ paśupā vājapastyo dhiyaṃjinvo bhuvane viśve arpitaḥ \|  
aṣṭrāṃ pūṣā śithirāmudvarīvṛjat saṃcakṣāṇobhuvanā deva īyate
\|\|**6.58.2**

“Goat-Rider, the lord of cattle, he whose dwelling is with treasures,
promoter/impeller (jinvo à jinvati) of thought (dhiyam), pervading all
the world; turning around his loose (śithira) weapon, beholding all of
the world, Pūṣan the deva proceeds.”

The epithet, “paśupā” is only used for Pūṣan in the whole of the Rg
Veda, making him the definitive lord of cattle. His lordship of cattle
is also stated in Yajur and Atharva Vedas.

In the Harivamśa, after Indra is defeated in his attempts to punish the
Gopagana and their cows with incessant showers for abandoning their
sacrifice to him, there is a bit of a long monologue by Indra to Kṛṣṇa,
of which I am presenting selected verses with translation from here.
(The translation by Śri Desiraju Hanumanta Rao is quite accurate.
Hence, I am not translating these verses myself to save some trouble. J)

mayotsR^iShTeShu megheShu yugAntAvartakAriShu \|

**Even though the clouds sent by me showered incessant rain, like at the
end of the ages (yuga), you protected the cows. I am highly pleased with
this.**

**brahmaloka is meant for people who are engaged in penances of brahma.
The goloka is meant only for cows where no others can enter.**

**kR^iShNa! When that world was weakened (when the cows were oppressed
by incessant rainfall) , you, vIra, eliminated all the distresses and
saved them.**

**kR^iShNa! I am the lord of all living beings, the king of gods,
puraMdara (indra). Earlier I was your elder brother, when you entered
the womb of aditi.**

**Lord! I tried to display my powers as a god before you. Kindly forgive
all my offences.**

**I am indra of the gods. Let you be the king of cows. From today, the
entire people on the face of earth will praise you eternally as
govinda.**

mamopari yathendrastvaM sthApito gobhirIshvaraH \|  
upendra iti kR^iShNa tvAM gAsyanti divi devatAH \|\|2-19-46

**kR^iShNa!, cows have installed you, above me, as their god, indra. At
heaven, gods will sing —-praising you as upendra.**

————————————————–END OF TRANSLATION——————————————————

Note the etymology behind the words, “Upendra” and “Govinda”. The former
term is typically explained by the story of Viṣṇu being born as the
younger brother of Indra (upendra=upa+indra, upa=small) in Vāmanāvatāra.
The latter term, Govinda was derived in the Mahābhārata on entirely
different grounds:

nastāṃ ca dharaṇīṃ pūrvam **avindaṃ** vai guhā gatām

govinda iti māṃ devā vāg bhiḥ samabhituṣṭuvuḥ **Mbh 12.330**

****“The world that was lost (nastāṃ ca dharaṇīṃ); I first retrieved
(**avindam**-obtained), it (having) gone into oblivion (guhā gatām).
Therefore, the Devas praise me as Govinda.”

It is irrelevant to inquire into the question as to the correct
etymology for the term, “Govinda” or which one came earlier. In fact,
the particular passage quoted from the Mahābhārata actually mentions Sri
Yāska in the context of obtaining lost Nirukta-s from Viṣṇu (**Mbh
12.330.7-8**) and might indeed be a much later interpolation as compared
to the Harivamśa passage in question. The point to note is that the
Kṛṣṇa of the Harivamśa has been woven into a bovine-centred framework.

Specifically with reference to this association with cows, we note a
striking parallel between Pūṣan’s function of protection of cows from
danger and loss, and Kṛṣṇa’s act of retrieving the lost cows. The
following verses from the Rig Veda highlight this key characteristic of
Pūṣan:

mākir**neśan** mākīṃ riṣan mākīṃ saṃ śāri kevaṭe \|

athāriṣṭābhirā ghahi \|\| **6.54.7**

“Let none be lost, none injured, none sink in a pit and break a limb.  
Return with these all safe and sound.”

pari pūṣā parastād dhastaṃ dadhātu dakṣiṇam \|

punarno **naṣṭa**mājatu \|\| **6.54.10**

“From the distance, let Pūṣan put his right hand around,

And drive to us our lost.”

pūṣā tvetaścyāvayatu pra vidvāna**naṣṭa**paśurbhuvanasya ghopāḥ
\|**10.17.3a**

“May Pūṣan cherish you; the wise one (vidvān) whose cows are never lost
(a**naṣṭa**paśur) and the protector of the world.

Compare these verses with this account in the Bhāgavata where Brahma
steals the calves and cowherd boys to test Kṛṣṇa.

ambhojanma-janis tad-antara-gato māyārbhakasyeśitur  
draṣṭuṃ mañju mahitvam anyad api tad-vatsān ito vatsapān

kvāpy adṛṣṭvāntar-vipine vatsān pālāṃś ca viśva-vit  
sarvaṃ vidhi-kṛtaṃ kṛṣṇaḥ sahasāvajagāma ha  
tataḥ kṛṣṇo mudaṃ kartuṃ tan-mātṝṇāṃ ca kasya ca

sarvaṃ viṣṇumayaṃ giro ‘ṅga-vad ajaḥ sarva-svarūpo babhau **Bhāgavata
10.13.15-19**

****To summarize, Brahma stole the calves and the cowherd boys in
Kṛṣṇa’s absence and when Kṛṣṇa realized this ploy of Brahma, he himself
manifested as the calves and cowherd boys for the sake of their
respective mothers and eventually Brahma apologizes to Kṛṣṇa and returns
the calves and boys back to Kṛṣṇa. There are many interesting
correspondences between Rg Vedic mantras pertaining to Pūṣan and
Paurānika narratives relating to Kṛṣṇa. But since they are often
similarities between a mere singular verse from the Veda and a mythic
account, they cannot be considered as solid evidence. Hence, I prefer to
see those “correspondences” as a product of my fertile imagination and
creativity, much in the likes of my fellow Āṅgirasa clansman of the
Gautama gotra, NīlakaṇṭhaCaturdhara, who saw Paurānika and Itihāsika
narratives buried in the words of the Rg Veda. Not to display audacity,
but I believe the “correspondences” I see are much more straightforward
than Nīlakaṇṭha’s attempts to find Kāśi Māhātmyam in the Rg Veda!

In any case, I shall return to the main topic of Pūṣan-Kṛṣṇa
similarities which can be adduced as tangible evidence in support of my
hypothesis that the Kṛṣṇa concept was in part based on Pūṣan. The above
accounts from the Harivamśa and the Bhāgavata depict Kṛṣṇa as a cowherd
among many cowherds. This strongly pastoral element could have been a
contribution by Bhāradvājas whose association with pastoralism and
particular fondness for cows may not have been limited to the Rg Veda
but might have continued by their descendants well into the
post-Mahābhārata era (Refer, for instance, to Bhāradvāja Grhya Sūtra,
2^(nd) praśna, 8^(th) Adhyāya, which prescribes an offering of cooked
rice (sthālīpāka in lieu of cow sacrifice in the Sūlagava). Apart from
this transposing of pastoral characteristics onto Kṛṣṇa, there seems to
have been another transference from Pūṣan to Kṛṣṇa’s brother,
Sańkarṣaṇa, the mighty Balarāma of the plough (Halāyudha).

Although there is no mention of Pūṣan using the plough, the Rg Veda at
RV 4.57, which is an agricultural hymn that mentions the plough several
times, states that Pūṣan guides the course of the furrow pressed down by
Indra.

indraḥ sītāṃ ni ghṛhṇātu tām pūṣānu yachatu \| **RV 4.57a**

“May Indra hold down the furrow; may Pūṣan guide her”

More interestingly, Sītā, the personified furrow as a goddess, who is
associated with Pūṣan, is the wife of Balarāma in Jaina Harivamśa.

Also, Pūṣan in the later Vedic texts happens to be the presiding deity
of Revati as the Taittiriya Samhita records it at 4.4.10
(revátīnákṣatrampūṣā́deváta). The relationship between Pūṣan and
Revati is mentioned in other sources such as the Gopatha Brāhmana and
Taittiriya Brāhmana and also reinforced in the Puruṣamedha and the
Nakṣatreṣṭi [as noted by the Ārya in his blog post on
Revati](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/12/04/the-beginnings-of-revati-the-vaidika-elements/).
Sańkarṣaṇa’s main wife is Revati as recognized in the Mahābhārata
(1.211), Harivamśa (2.89) and also the Bhāgavata (9.3). This strengthens
the hypothesis that Pūṣan may have played a significant role in the
shaping up of Vārṣṇeya mythology centred on Kṛṣṇa and Sańkarṣaṇa.

For now, we conclude our study here.
