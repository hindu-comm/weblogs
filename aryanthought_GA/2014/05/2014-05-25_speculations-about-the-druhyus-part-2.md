# Speculations about the Druhyus-Part2

Part 2: Druhyu, Dasyu and Trasadasyu

[Continued from Part
1](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/speculations-about-the-druhyus-part-1/ "Speculations about the Druhyus-Part 1")



In the previous post about Druhyu culture, we had concluded with a brief
note about Trasadasyu of the Iksvakava, the grandson of the renowned
Mandhatr. Now, although we do not have any account of this Trasadasyu’s
exploits, (He is mentioned as the son of Purukutsa and as the father of
Sambhuta, and skipped over in most of the Puranic accounts) it is only
natural to infer that he must have been more than a mere geneaological
filler for the Iksvakava, given that his given name is very charged and
has violent connotations. ‘Trasadasyu’ literally means, “Terror to the
Dasyu”. It suggests that he was brought up for a militant calling; to
subjugate and utterly destroy the Dasyu. In the previous post, we saw
that the chief antagonist in Mandhatr’s battles were the Druhyus and in
the case of his son Purukutsa, it was the Druhyus again, led by Gandhara
(Mythologized as Gandharvas). It is possible that the once powerful
Druhyu, although rendered weak after two generations of continuous
assault by the Iksvakava, might have attempted to revive its lost glory
and make a comeback. It is likely that Trasadasyu might have had a
fierce encounter with the Druhyus.



This makes greater sense in the context of the statement that Mandhatr
became an Angirasa. That is, he and his descendants, who were born as
Iksvakava Kshatriyas, had become Brahmanas of the Angirasa clan. The
Angirasa absorbed several prominent Kshatriya clans into their folds and
spawned new gotrams. Even those of pure Brahmana descent among them were
often involved in the war enterprise, such as Drona, Ashvatthama or the
group of Bharadvajins (Bharadvaja Barhaspatya, Payu Bharadvaja & Samyu
Bharadvaja) who were the seers of the sixth mandala of the Rig Veda. For
those who have a taste for the history of the great priestly clans, they
would know the warring spirit of the Angirasas. Their being Brahmanas
hardly stopped them from being a fearsome and formiddable enemy to
anyone; a searing reminder of our heroic roots-of both the Brahma and
the Kshatra. In the Rig Veda, Sarama the bitch threatens the miserly
Panis by warning them about the “terrible” (Ghoran) Angirases.
Brihaspati, one of the founding fathers of the redoubtable Angirasa
clan, was himself attributed this ability to inspire terror among his
foes, and this aspect of his is immortalized in the memory of the
composers of the Rig Veda, who point out the awfulness of this Angirasa
doyen in his encounter with the Panis; a far cry from the weak
“auspicious planet” status he has been relegated to in the temples of
today.



Coming back, Trasadasyu must have been groomed for greatness with
Angirasa influence, in order to prepare him for an assault against the
Druhyus. However, it remains pertinent to determine the identity of the
‘Dasyu’ referred to in the name of our Iksvaku prince. If,
chronologically speaking, this is the first ever use of a personal name
that refers to the “Dasyus” in a hostile sense, we could hypothesize
that the Dasyus most probably stood for the Druhyus and that it was
probably a perjorative rendition of ‘Druhyu’ in a Vedic dialect that we
no longer have access to. Unfortunately, little work has been done to
derive the etymology of the word, ‘Dasyu’. Attempts have been made to
make it a cognate with Avestan ‘Dahyu’, meaning province or land and
then derive a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root –das. However, this
approach is a mere distraction from arriving at any proper
understanding, as the Rig Veda, for the most part, predates the Avesta.
Zarathustra’s reforms of the old religion, his conception of evil daevas
and etc, can only be understood as a response to the more ancient Vedic
tradition. Furthermore, if we take the pauranika tradition as seriously
as it ought to be, the usage of the word, “Dasyu” predates even the
composition of the oldest hymns of the Rig Veda, book 6. (Here,
Divodasa, the near ancestor of Sudas, is spoken of in a contemporaneous
sense, and Trasadasyu of the Iksvaku is long antecendent to Divodasa of
the North Pancala dynasty) Hence, it would not be too wise to figure out
the meaning of Dasyu in this way.



In the Rig Veda, two groups are singled out as enemies of the Aryas: The
Dasas and Dasyus. Some scholars, such as Talageri (unfortunately his
overall work lacks scientific and objective claims, and his argument for
OIT is far removed from a proper appreciation of linguistics) have
shown the crucial difference between these terms. Due credit must be
given to Talageri for showing in The Historical Analysis of the Rig Veda
that the hostilities against the Dasyu have primarily religious
undertones, as indicated by the following adjectives and appelations
used against the Dasyus:

IV.16.9



Apart from these adjectives, the Rig Veda also makes a statement that
might point out the reason behind these hostilities.

māyābhirutsisṛpsata indra dyāmārurukṣataḥ \|  
ava dasyūnradhūnuthāḥ VIII.14.14

“You have hurled down, Indra, the Dasyus who glide upwards by tricks
(Maya) and (try to) ascend to heaven.”

As Wash Edward Hale explains after citing these verses in his
insightful, although slightly biased, ‘Ásura- in Early Vedic Religion’
(Pg. 146): “Perhaps this means that the Aryans accused the Dasyus of
attempting to usurp their religion. The prohibitions found in the later
Dharmasastra texts against Sudras participating in practices that belong
to the twice born make it quite likely that such usurpation would have
been frowned on at an earlier time, too.”

Even the rather secular charges against the Dasyus that they were not
gift-giving (apṛṇato), when seen in the light of the overall religious
focus of the rhetoric against them, seem to imply that the frustrations
of the rishis, who composed these hyms, stemmed from a deep-seated sense
of economic insecurity. The Dasyus, of non-Brahmanical lineage and with
no hereditary kinship with any Rishi clan, executed the sacrifices by
themselves without the involvement of the traditional priests, thus
depriving them of a source of income and also initiate a trend that
could be imitated by other warrior clans.

It is possible that the Angirases, as one of the main founders of a
pyro-centric cult along with the Bhargavas, felt that their interests
were being threatened by a Kshatriya encroachment into a ritual
territory that rightfully belonged to them. Thus, it might have been in
their interests to rally for the Ikshvakava cause against the Drauhyava,
who might have been pioneers of a Kshatriyas-led ritual system. In the
course of time, after the Druhyu had been cast away into the obscure
pages of history by the Ikshvakava assault, the term, “Dasyu” might have
lost its original connection with “Druhyu” and become open to new
meanings. However, it might have preserved a memory of this religious
conflict in being possibly used as a hostile term in the Rig Veda for
followers of a rival religion.

Although the Sudras almost uniformly experienced the disenfranchisement
of their rights to Vedic rites, (With the notable exceptions of the
Rathakara and Nishadha, who enjoyed a certain degree of presence in the
ritual arena), a significant portion of them may have been descendants
of conquered and consequently degraded Kshatriyas, who once enjoyed
these rights. The Manava Dharma Shastra seems to imply a connection
between Dasyus and Kshatriyas who had opposed the Brahmanical religion:

shanakaistu kriyAlopAdimAH kShatriyajAtayaH

vRiShalatvaM gatA loke brAhmaNAtikrameNa cha

puNDrakAshchoDadraviDAH kAmbojA yavanAH shakAH

pAradApahlavAshchInAH kirAtA daradAH khashAH

mukhabAhUrupadjAnAM yA loke jAtayo bahiH

mlechChavAchashchAryavAchaH sarve te dasyavaH smRitAH

“In consequence of the omission of the sacred rites, and of their not
consulting Brahmanas, the following tribes of Kshatriyas have gradually
sunk in this world to the condition of Vrishalas;

The paundraka, the chodA, the dravidas, the kambojas, the yavanas, the
shakAH, the pAradA, the pahlavA, the chinAH, the kirAtA, the daradAH and
the Khasas.

All those tribes in this world, which are excluded from (the community
of) those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the feet (of
Brahman), are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the
Mlecchas (barbarians) or that of the Aryans” MDS X.43-45

This verse from the MDS also discredits the opinion that the Dasyus were
the “aboriginal, indigenous” people of India. Rather, they were a
heterogenous group of great ethno-linguistic diversity, whose
constituent tribes spoke either Arya Bhasha (Indic languages) or Mleccha
Bhasha (Other languages). Thus, the demarcation between Dasyus and
Non-Dasyus lies in their approach towards Brahmanas and whether they
subscribed to the religious practices established by the Aryan people.

There is yet another piece of evidence from the Jaiminiya Brahmana
(3.423) that clinches the case for the Kshatriya connection of the
Dasyus. It comes in the form of a peculiar advice for an awfully
specific situation:



“If one is wandering in the forest with a kshatriya and meets a Dasyu,
he should be friendly.”

It is unclear in what context such an advice would have proven to be
useful. However, there definitely seems to be an implication that the
Dasyus are ethnically related to the Kshatriyas and that it is in a
person’s interests if he is amicable to a Dasyu in the presence of a
Kshatriya in a secluded location, where the Kshatriya, having more
freedom to act as he wills, might choose to act more favourable towards
his Dasyu brethren. However, given the overwhelming lack of evidence,
one can only speculate about the Drauhyava and their culture. There is
still more to be discussed about the Bhargava connection of the Druhyus
and the Kavasa clan, which produced two very distinguished individuals
in Vedic history. But these are posts for a different time; but not too
far ahead.
