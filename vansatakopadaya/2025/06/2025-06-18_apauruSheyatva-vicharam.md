Vaṇśaṭhakōpadayā

The claim that the Vedas are **apaurusheya** (not authored by any person) has been a cornerstone of Purva and Uttara Mimamsa Vaidika tradition. However, this has been questioned by some based on several linguistic, grammatical, historical, and scriptural arguments. In this article, we examine these objections and compile answers to them.

## **Arguments Contesting Apaurusheyatva**

1.  **Shruti Names Indicate Authorship**:
    -   Sections of the Vedas like काठक (*Kathaka)* and पैप्पलाद
        (*Paippalada)* are named after rishis, By तद्धित pratyaya,
        सकर्तृकत्व is indicated for various shrutis.. 2.  **Vedic Passages Indicate Creation**:
    -   “तस्माद्यज्ञा-स्सर्वहुतः । ऋचस्सामानि जज्ञिरे । छन्दांसि जज्ञिरे
        तस्मात् । यजुस्तस्मादजायत”
    -   “तस्य ह वा एतस्य महतो भूतस्य निश्वसितमेतद्यदृग्वेदः” 3.  **Mantra-Krt Usage**:
    -   There is the sukta of vishvamitra too indicating his authorship
        by the ablative case. “नम ऋषिभ्यो मन्त्रकृद्भ्यः” is the
        statement referring to rishis as creators of mantras, as is
        evidenced from the usage of ‘kRt’. As per the sutra
        “सुकर्मपापमन्त्रपुण्येषु कृञः”
    -   According to this grammatical rule, the root कृ (kṛ), when used
        with सु (su) meaning ‘well’, कर्म (karma) meaning ‘action’, पाप
        (pāpa) meaning ‘sin’, मन्त्र (mantra) meaning ‘hymn’, and पुण्य
        (puṇya) meaning ‘virtue’, takes the Kvip pratyaya in the sense
        of past action or completed act, thereby implying one who has
        made a mantra, i.e., a mantra-kṛt (mantra-maker or composer of
        hymns). There are other places also, such as the rig vedic verse
        “ऋषे॑ मन्त्र॒कृतां॒ स्तोमै॒: कश्य॑पोद्व॒र्धय॒न्गिर॑: । सोमं॑
        नमस्य॒ राजा॑नं॒ यो ज॒ज्ञे वी॒रुधां॒ पति॒रिन्द्रा॑येन्दो॒ परि॑
        स्रव ॥” which affirm the same.
    -   There is also a reference to the descendents of gotama having
        composed a new hymn to Indra indicating that the hymn was
        created:

&nbsp;

4.  **Chariot-Making Simile**:
    -   Some compare the making of hymns in the Vedas to the building of
        a chariot. Just as a charioteer skillfully assembles a chariot,
        the ṛṣi carefully composes each part of the hymn. This
        highlights that Vedic hymns were crafted with intention and
        poetic skill, not just received passively.
    -   इ॒मां ते॒ वाचं॑ वसू॒यन्त॑ आ॒यवो॒ रथं॒ न धीर॒: स्वपा॑ अतक्षिषुः
        सु॒म्नाय॒ त्वाम॑तक्षिषुः । (RV 1.130.6)
    -   इ॒मा ब्रह्मा॑णि॒ वर्ध॑ना॒श्विभ्यां॑ सन्तु॒ शंत॑मा । या तक्षा॑म॒
        रथाँ॑ इ॒वावो॑चाम बृ॒हन्नम॑: ॥(RV 5.73.10)

&nbsp;

5.  **Inference from Language**:
    -   Vedic sentences are *vakya*, and since all sentences are made by
        a person, Vedas must be *paurusheya*. – वेदवाक्यानि पौरुषेयाणि,
        वाक्यत्वात्, रथ्यापुरुषवाक्यवत्

&nbsp;

6.  **Historical Events**:
    -   Mentions of events like the Battle of Ten Kings imply the Vedas
        were written *after* these events occurred. various heroics of
        the Gods etc. If it were eternal, how can such events and names
        of people present which happened at a point in time be told even
        before they came into existence?

&nbsp;

7.  **Genealogical Terms**:
    -   “भृगुर्वै वारुणिः, वरुणं पितरमुपससार”, “श्वेतकेतुर्हारुणेय आस ।
        तं ह पितोवाच” – Terms like “वारुणिः” and “आरुणेय” show temporal
        composition referencing existing people.

&nbsp;

8.  **Descriptive Narration of Events**:
    -   Statements like “प्रजापतिरकामयत” indicate a past event, implying
        temporal origin.

&nbsp;

9.  **Non-Eternal Nature of Sound**:
    -   It is known that the sounds/words uttered are non-eternal in
        nature. Therefore, it is to be inferred that the vedas too,
        which are made of these too be non-eternal.

## **Affirmation of Apaurusheyatva**

1.  **Self-Assertion of Eternity in the Vedas**:
    -   The following hymn is found in Rig Veda as well as Taittriya
        Samhita.
    -   तस्मै॑ नू॒नम॒भिद्य॑वे वा॒चा वि॑रूप॒ नित्य॑या । वृष्णे॑ चोदस्व
        सुष्टु॒तिम् ॥(RV 8.75.6, TS 2.6.11)
    -   The adjective नित्य॑या qualifies वा॒चा indicating the eternal
        nature of such a hymn. This is what Sayana tells: “नित्यया
        उत्पत्तिरहितया वाचा मन्त्ररूपया सुष्टुतिम्”

&nbsp;

2.  **Supreme Vedic Seat**:
    -   It is also pertinent to look at another famous Rig Veda verse:
    -   ऋ॒चो अ॒क्षरे॑ पर॒मे व्यो॑म॒न्यस्मि॑न्दे॒वा अधि॒ विश्वे॑ निषे॒दुः
        ।
    -   यस्तन्न वेद॒ किमृ॒चा क॑रिष्यति॒ य इत्तद्वि॒दुस्त इ॒मे समा॑सते
        ॥(RV 1.164.39)
    -   This is the translation given by HH Wilson:
    -   All the gods have taken their seats upon this supreme heaven,
        the imperishable (text) of the Veda; what will he, who knows not
        this, do with the Veda? but they who do know it, they are
        perfect.

&nbsp;

3.  **Taittiriya Aranyaka**:
    -   The Taittriya Aranyaka too affirms that the vedas are
        self-manifested and eternal:
    -   अ॒जान् ह॒ वै पृश्नीग्॑स्तप॒स्यमा॑ना॒न्ब्रह्म॑
        स्वय॒म्भ्व॑भ्यान॑र्ष॒त्त
    -   ऋष॑योऽभव॒न्तदृषी॑णामृषि॒त्वं (TA 2.9.13)
    -   Vedas revealed themselves to the sages who engaged in tapas
        (tapasyamānan) and the ṛṣis did not create the Vedas; instead,
        they “saw” or received them through inner vision. Their status
        as ṛṣis came from this ability to perceive the sacred knowledge
        (ṛṣayaḥabhavan).

&nbsp;

4.  **Etymology from Nirukta**:
    -   The brahmana also gives the etymology of Rishi as the seers of
        such mantras, as explained by Yaska in his Nirukta.
    -   ऋषिर्दर्शनात् । स्तोमन्ददर्शेत्यौपमन्यवः ।
        तद्यदेनांस्तपस्यमानान् ब्रह्म स्वयम्भू अभ्यानर्षत् तदृषयोऽभवन्
        तदृषीणामृषित्वम् – इति विज्ञायते\|( Nirukta 2.11)
    -   Elsewhere too, Yaska emphasises on rishis being mantra drashtas:
    -   एवमुच्चावचैरभिप्रायैर्ऋषीणां मन्त्रदृष्टयो भवन्ति ।( Nirukta
        7.3)
    -   It has been accepted even by grammarians that dhatus can have
        multiple meanings.
    -   This idea is reiterated in Rig Veda:
    -   य॒ज्ञेन॑ वा॒चः प॑द॒वीय॑माय॒न्तामन्व॑विन्द॒न्नृषि॑षु॒
        प्रवि॑ष्टाम् ।
    -   तामा॒भृत्या॒ व्य॑दधुः पुरु॒त्रा तां स॒प्त रे॒भा अ॒भि सं न॑वन्ते
        ॥( RV 10.71.3)
    -   The speech of the veda was found to have “entered” into the
        rishis and then taken. This was learnt and distributed to
        various places. This is what Sayana has to tell in this matter:
    -   तं वाचः मार्गं यज्ञेन आयन् प्राप्तवन्तः । ऋषिपु
        अतीन्द्रियार्थदर्शिषु प्रविष्टां तां वाचम् अविन्दन् अलभन्त ।
        अनन्तरं तां वाचम् आमृत्य आहृत्य पुरुत्रा बहुषु देशेषु व्यदधुः
        व्यकार्षुः । सर्वान् मनुष्यानध्यापयामासुरित्यर्थः ।
    -   Based on the above explanations, as well as the etymological
        meaning of rishi found in the brahmana as well as nirukta we
        should interpret mantrakrt as mantradrashta rather than the
        actual maker of mantras. Patanjali shows that one of the
        meanings of the dhatu कृञ् is to manifest what was not earlier
        by the agent.
    -   “बह्वर्था अपि धातवो भवन्ति । … करोतिरभूतप्रादुर्भावे दृष्टः”
    -   This is his observation.
    -   One can also look at the following sutra in ashtadhyayi
    -   गन्धन-अवक्षेपण-सेवन-साहसिक्य-प्रतियत्न-प्रकथन-उपयोगेषु
        कृञः(1.3.32) which shows that multiple meaning are possible for
        that dhatu.

&nbsp;

5.  **Samhita Naming Convention**:
    -   The naming of Vedic branches, such as काठक and पैप्पलाद,
        reflects the sages who preserved and transmitted these hymns,
        not their authorship. These names indicate the lineage through
        which the hymns werepasseddown.

&nbsp;

6.  **Mantra Seen, Not Made**:
    -   TA 2.7: “त एतानि सूक्तान्यपश्यन्।”
    -   TS 5.4.6 and TS 7.4.7 reinforce mantras being *seen* and then
        *brought out*.
    -   देवासु॒राः संय॑त्ता आस॒न्ते दे॒वा ए॒तदप्र॑तिरथमपश्य॒न्तेन॒ वै
        ते॑ प्र॒त्य सु॑रानजय॒न्तदप्र॑तिरथस्याप्रतिरथ॒त्वं (TS 5.4.6),
        वसि॑ष्ठो ह॒तपु॑त्रोऽकामयत वि॒न्देय॑ प्र॒जाम॒भि
        सौ॑दा॒सान्भ॑वेय॒मिति॒ स ए॒तमे॑कस्मान्न
        पञ्चा॒शम॑पश्य॒त्तमाह॑र॒त्तेना॑यजत॒(TS 7.4.7) and many more. 7.  **Presence of Multiple rishis for various mantras:**
    -   We see the presence of multiple mantra drashtas for a single
        mantra, which occurs in different contexts. Now if mantras were
        indeed authored by humans, it is not possible to make the exact
        same mantra by 2 entirely different authors.
    -   Take for example the following mantra: य॒ज्ञेन॑ य॒ज्ञम॑यजन्त
        दे॒वास्तानि॒ धर्मा॑णि प्रथ॒मान्या॑सन् । ते ह॒ नाकं॑ महि॒मान॑:
        सचन्त॒ यत्र॒ पूर्वे॑ सा॒ध्याः सन्ति॑ दे॒वाः ॥
    -   This comes in Rig Veda 1.164.50, as well as 10.90.16. The rishi
        in the former case is dīrghatamas, while the rishi in the latter
        case is nārāyaṇa. 8.  **Examples from Bhagavad Gita**:
    -   We should note that words which are associated with “creation”
        of something need not necessarily mean making something new from
        scratch or nothing, but refers to changes in certain forms,
        without necessarily modifying the basic structure. Take for
        example the Gita verse
    -   यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत । अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य
        तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्‌ ॥
    -   Here by “सृजामि” it is obvious that krishna isn’t referring to
        creation of a totally new individual Vishnu/Krishna, but merely
        taking up different forms for the sake of incarnations. The same
        is said of texts such as नव्य॒मत॑क्ष॒द्ब्रह्म॑, या तक्षा॑म॒
        रथाँ॑ इ॒वावो॑चाम etc.
    -   It is well known that during yajnas, the stoma/tune, pitch etc
        are changed for addressing devatas. Various riks are also
        rendered a musical form. It is in this sense, that it is made
        “new”. The original base that is the rik remains the same. The
        simile of a chariot being made from wood is also easily
        understandable. The base wood is nothing but the rik mantra. The
        dieties are addressed using sAmans created from these riks,
        which refers to the final refined chariot. 9.  **Cyclic Time Framework**:
    -   The reference to various historical events too is of not much
        significance, due to the cyclic nature of time as is seen in the
        rig veda verse:
    -   सू॒र्या॒च॒न्द्र॒मसौ॑ धा॒ता य॑थापू॒र्वम॑कल्पयत् ।
    -   दिवं॑ च पृथि॒वीं चा॒न्तरि॑क्ष॒मथो॒ स्व॑: ॥(RV 10.191.3)
    -   The sun, moon and others were created now just as they were in
        the previous kalpa. That the vedas were carried on from the
        previous kalpa too is evidenced from the Taittriya Brahmana.
    -   सर्वꣳ॑ हे॒दं ब्रह्म॑णा है॒व सृ॒ष्टम् ।….पूर्वे॒ पूर्वे॑भ्यो॒ वच॑
        ए॒तदू॑चुः । आ॒द॒र्॒शम॒ग्निं चि॑न्वा॒नाः । पूर्वे॑
        विश्व॒सृजो॒ऽमृताः॑ ।
    -   Sayana observes as follows: एवं मनुष्यव्यवहारस्यापीत्येतद्वचः
        पूर्वे सृष्ट्यादौ उत्पन्नाः महर्षयः पूर्वेभ्यस्तदानींतनेभ्यः
        स्वशिष्येभ्यः ऊचुः
    -   By this, the inference वेदवाक्यानि पौरुषेयाणि, वाक्यत्वात् also
        becomes invalidated. If it be asked back to the purvapakshin as
        to why there shouldn’t be an eternal lineage passing down the
        vedas, there cannot be any counter to the same.
    -   Furthermore, the fact that the vedas were not created by rishis
        also, but rather handed over by Ishvara to brahma is evidenced
        from the shvetashvataropanishad:
    -   “यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै”
    -   These veda mantras being used by chaturmukha brahma to make the
        worlds is described in Taittriya Brahmana itself:
    -   वेदे॑न रू॒पे व्य॑करोत् । स॒ता॒स॒ती प्र॒जाप॑तिः (TB 2.6.2.3)
    -   Therefore, those events mentioned in the vedas are those
        occurring eternally in each kalpa. Therefore, the presence of
        these events doesn’t mean that the vedas have to be made newly
        only after these happened.
    -   Therefore, due to the fact that persons with same names happen
        over every cycle, the inference of that particular verse, such
        as “भृगुर्वै वारुणिः”, “श्वेतकेतुर्हारुणेय आस” occurring at a
        particular time later on only has no significance. 10. **Smriti Support**:
    -   Such a view is present in the smritis too, such as in
        Mahabharata which affirms that the vedas are eternal.
    -   अनादिनिधना नित्या वागुत्सृष्टा स्वयम्भुवा ।आदौ वेदमयी दिव्या यत:
        सर्वा: प्रवृत्तय:।।(MBh Shanti parva 231.46)
    -   The sage Manu too calls the veda as eternal:
    -   अग्निर्वायुरविभ्यस्तु त्रयं ब्रह्म सनातनम् । दुदोह
        यज्ञसिद्ध्यर्थम् ऋग्यजुस्सामलक्षणम् ॥(MS 1.13)
    -   वसून् वदन्ति तु पितॄन् रुद्रांश्च एव पितामहान् ।
        प्रपितामहांस्तथादित्यान् श्रुतिरेषा सनातनी ॥(MS 3.284)
    -   These form the upabrhmana for statements such as वा॒चा वि॑रूप॒
        नित्य॑या mentioned before, adding confirmation.
