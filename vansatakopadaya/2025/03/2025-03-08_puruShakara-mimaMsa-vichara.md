## Introduction

The *Puruṣakāra mīmāṃsā* is an important *grantha* in the history of *śrivaiṣṇava* literature. It is the first *grantha* post the time of *vedānta deśika* which attempts to discuss the nature of *lakṣmī devi* in *śrivaiṣṇava sampradāya*. However, there are some misconceptions surrounding the work leading to baseless allegations such as in this work by the author <https://acharya.org/bk/pb/tar/ogam.pdf> in page 75

> ..asserts that the Ahobila Mutt jeeyars wrote “Purushakara Mimamsa”
> ,”Rahasya traya jeevathu” according to the Thenkalai tenets only and
> established that they belong to the Thenkalai sampradaya only..

We shall analyse the above claim and try to address two main questions about the work:

-   1\. Who was the actual author of the work and
-   2\. What was his real position on the nature of *lakṣmī*.

## The author of the work

The traditional *śrīsannidhi guruparaṃparā* attributes the work to the *2^(nd) Aḻagiyasingar*, HH *Śrīvaṇśaṭhakopa Śrīnārāyaṇa yatīndra mahādeśikan*. Some of the traditional acharyas are of the opinion that this was a *vāda grantha* which had *pūrvapakṣa* and the *siddhānta* position. Some people purposefully hid the *siddhānta* section keeping the *pūrvapakṣa* section alone claiming that this was the correct view of the author. Then Sākṣāt svāmī made his work śrī tattva siddhāñjana to refute the *pūrvapakṣa* and restore the *siddhānta*. This view isn’t wholly satisfying and has the following issues associated with it:

1.  Older *guruparaṃparā* texts such as *Periya Thirumudi Adaivu* do not
    mention *puruṣakāra mīmāṃsa* as the work of the *2^(nd)
    Azhagiyasingar*, while mentioning many of his other works. 2.  *Sākṣāt svāmī* in his work *Śri Tattva siddhanjanam* describes the
    position of “*pūrvapakṣa*” as accepting *lakṣmī* as the *iśvari*,
    being all pervasive and of having a mutual agreement with her lord.

> devyā: tu īśvaratvameva ācārya siddhānta iti bhavatām api sammatam
> …catuśślokī bhāṣyokta pañcamapakṣa eva ācāryapāda siddhanta: iti
> aṅgīkārācca

This clearly can’t be the position of a *pūrvapakṣī* against *deśika saṃpradāya* (That *lakṣmī* is vibhu svarupa and sākṣāṭ iśvari and being subservient to the Lord by Her own nature is the view of *deśika*. Those belonging tolokācārya *saṃpradāya* believe that lakṣmī is anu svarupa and is a jiva subservient to the Lord by her own nature).

3\. The *puruṣakāra mīmāṃsa* has a commentary by the name *Maṇidīpikā*. *Maṇidipikā* was also a counter criticism of the work of *Sākṣāṭ svāmī* (*Śri Tattva siddhanjanam*) written by *śrīśaileśa*. śrīśaileśa identifies himself as the disciple of *Nārāyaṇa Muni* and wrote a benedictory verse of his:

> śrīvirarāghavamunervarivasyaikajīvanam \|
>
> samāśrayemahi śrīmannārāyaṇamunīśvaram \|\|
>
> श्रीविरराघवमुनेर्वरिवस्यैकजीवनम् ।
>
> समाश्रयेमहि श्रीमन्नारायणमुनीश्वरम् ॥

This is incidentally the same as the taniyan of the 14^(th) Azhagiyasingar *Śrīvaṇśaṭhakopa Śrīnārāyaṇa yatīndra mahādeśikan*. The conclusion of the *maṇidīpikā* contains the following:

> sarvatantrasvatantra śrīmacchaṭhakopa
> yogīndradivyaparaṃparānupraviṣṭānāṃ pūrveṣāṃ śrīmannārāyaṇayogīndrāṇāṃ
> dāsyasūcakena nārāyaṇapadena bhagavanmananādiśīlatāsūcakena…. śālitvam
> uktaṃ bhavati
>
> सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्र श्रीमच्छठकोप योगीन्द्रदिव्यपरंपरानुप्रविष्टानां
> पूर्वेषां श्रीमन्नारायणयोगीन्द्राणां दास्यसूचकेन नारायणपदेन
> भगवन्मननादिशीलतासूचकेन…. शालित्वम् उक्तं भवति

Notice that the author refers to previous seers with the name “*nārāyaṇa muni*” in plural indicating that there were at least 3 *jiyars* with the name *Nārāyaṇa muni* before the author. This is obviously an indirect reference to the 2^(nd), 9^(th) and the 12^(th) *azhagiyasingars*.

Given all the above evidence, we therefore can conclusively make the judgement that the work *puruṣakāra mīmāṃsa* is that of the ***14^(th) Azhagiyasingar*** who wrote with the pen name of ***śrīvatsāṅka nārāyaṇa muni*** and not the **2^(nd)** as is traditionally believed.

## The theology of the author of *Puruśakāra Mimāmsa*: Did he subscribe to the views of Deśika Sampradaya?

#### His *nirvāha* of the 5 views on *lakṣmī*

Related to the above is the claim that the first 5 *Azhagiyasingars* were not *vaḍakalais* and the nature of the *maṭham* changed later. However, we have shown that this work isn’t that of the 2^(nd) *Azhagiyasingar*. Now, we also show from the view of the author himself, that *lakṣmī* is the *iśvari*, and that he held to the 5^(th) *pakśa* of *vedānta deśika* as has been put in his *catuśślokī bhāṣya*. The following statement of his makes it clear:

> *pūrvapūrvopamardena pakṣāṇāmupavarṇanāt \| yatra pūrvopamardena
> nānāpakṣa: prakīrtita: \|\|tatra sarvatra carama: saṃgrāhya: iti
> niścaya: \|\|*
>
> पूर्वपूर्वोपमर्देन पक्षाणामुपवर्णनात् ।
>
> यत्र पूर्वोपमर्देन नानापक्ष: प्रकीर्तित: । तत्र सर्वत्र चरम:
> संग्राह्य: इति निश्चय: ॥

The author says that *Vedānta deśika* arranges the views in the increasing order of importance and finally concludes that the final paksha i.e the 5^(th) one is to be taken as his own view which corresponds to the present-day view of *vaḍakalais acāryas* too. He himself states that *lakṣmī* becomes subordinate to *nārāyaṇa* by their own mutual will and rule the world.

> siddhaṃ tadubhayecchata: sarvaiśvaryaśrute: dvayo:
>
> सिद्धं तदुभयेच्छत: सर्वैश्वर्यश्रुते: द्वयो:

It is to be noted that if the author held *lakṣmī* to be a *jiva* then such a thing isn’t possible as a *jiva* is subordinate by its very nature and not by any condition. Regarding the benediction of moksha, the author mentions that the wish maybe with that of *Viṣṇu* alone or both Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa.

> sāmyapradānasaṃkalpastu īśasya eva athavā cobhayo:
>
> साम्यप्रदानसंकल्पस्तु ईशस्य एव अथवा चोभयो:

#### His view on her role in the process of surrender

Regarding the *Upāya*, the author declares that *Viṣṇu* qualified by *lakṣmī* and all his other qualities is the goal and the means to attain it. He also states that being a qualification for *nārāyaṇa* at the time of *Prapatti*, She destroys the sins of the *prapanna*, creates a taste in that person of the goal and gives the conviction that the Lord alone is the means.

> प्रापकाध्यवसायिताम् ॥
>
> यद्यप्यात्महविर्यज्ञे प्राधान्यमुभयोरपि । विशेषणं शरण्यस्य भरन्यासे
> तथापि सा ॥

#### Her status as īśvarī

Finally in another verse of the work, the author declares explicitly that *lakṣmī* belongs to the *iśvarakoṭi* and not *jīvakoṭi* as she is the one who directs the Lord himself:

> yadicchāyaiva yatprītyai śāsanaṃ nigrahādi ca \|tatra
> nigrāhyajātīyavisajātīyatāmati : \|\|
>
> śakti: śriyo’sti necchati niyantraṃśe vyavasthiti: \|śāstrapramāṇakaṃ
> hyetad akliṣṭo’yaṃ mahāpatha: \|\|
>
> यदिच्छायैव यत्प्रीत्यै शासनं निग्रहादि च ।
>
> तत्र निग्राह्यजातीयविसजातीयतामति : ॥
>
> “शक्ति: श्रियोऽस्ति नेच्छति नियन्त्रंशे व्यवस्थिति: । शास्त्रप्रमाणकं
> ह्येतद् अक्लिष्टोऽयं महापथ:

Regarding some qualities exclusive to the Lord alone like *nigraha*, the commentator *srisaileśa* mentions that *lakṣmī* too has the capacity to show it, but doesn’t do so out of Her will: *nigrahaśakti: śriya: asti necchati*.

The commentator himself mentions that *lakṣmī* too accepts the burden of protecting the *jiva* by her grace alone without having any trace of *nigraha* which is the chief difference between her and *Bhagavān Viṣṇu*.

> anugrahakṛta anavacchinna ānanda pradānātmakarakṣāsaṅkalpa
> anavacchinna ānanda nirūpita bharasvīkārau śriya: api avaśyaṃ bhāvinau
> virodhābhāvāt iti hṛdayam
>
> अनुग्रहकृत अनवच्छिन्न आनन्द प्रदानात्मकरक्षासङ्कल्प अनवच्छिन्न आनन्द
> निरूपित भरस्वीकारौ श्रिय: अपि अवश्यं भाविनौ विरोधाभावात् इति हृदयम्

In the conclusion, while mentioning that *Pillai Lokācāryā’s* works and *Vedānta deśika’s* works are to be taken in a holistic manner, the commentator observes the following while distinguishing their views:

> śrīrahasyatrayasārādau śriyo vibhutva īśvaratva upāyatva
> mātṛtva-anuguṇakāraṇatva prapattavyatva
> bhagavadviśeṣaṇatvalakṣaṇārthānāṃ pratipādanāt lokācārya prabandheṣu
> jīvakoṭi kāraṇatva puruṣakāratva lakṣaṇatvādīnāmeva pratipādanāt
>
> श्रीरहस्यत्रयसारादौ श्रियो विभुत्व ईश्वरत्व उपायत्व
> मातृत्व-अनुगुणकारणत्व प्रपत्तव्यत्व भगवद्विशेषणत्वलक्षणार्थानां
> प्रतिपादनात् लोकाचार्य प्रबन्धेषु जीवकोटि कारणत्व पुरुषकारत्व
> लक्षणत्वादीनामेव प्रतिपादनात्

“In the essence of the *Śrīrahasyatrayasārā*, the attributes of aiśvarya, power, lordship, means, motherhood, causality, and prapatti are described as special characteristics of the divine. In the treatises of the Lokacāryā, the characteristics of being the cause of countless souls, being the doer, and other such attributes are also described.”

All these go on to prove that the author was expounding the 5^(th) paksha of Vedānta Deśika as mentioned in his *catuśślokī bhāṣya* and didn’t claim that *lakṣmī* belonged to the category of jivātmās unlike what some would want to claim.

#### Summary of the views in puruṣakāra mīmāṃsā as given by the commentator on the work

The commentator of the *puruṣakāra mīmāṃsā* mentions the below attributes as being propounded in *Deśika’s catuśślokī bhāṣya* as per his *ācārya*’s views:

> “anugrahātmaka jagadvyāpāreṣu sākṣāt kartṛtvaṃ, nigrahaghaṭita
> jagadvyāpāreṣu patiprerakatayā kartṛtvaṃ,
> bhagavadvyatiriktasarvāntarātmatvaṃ,bhagavadvyatiriktasarvādhāratvaṃ,

Translation of the same:

-   **Lakṣmī being the doer of any activity in the world requiring
    grace.**
-   **The impeller of Viṣṇu in activities requiring punishment.**
-   **The soul of all entities other than Bhagavān.**
-   **The support of all entities other than Bhagavān.**
-   **The master of those activities which are good.**
-   **Controlling all those activities which are for the good and liking
    of Them.**
-   **Having the capacity to punish evil doers (but not showing it).**
-   **The master of both vibhutis.**
-   **The unconditional controller of the same.**
-   **all pervasive.**
-   **The mediatrix.**
-   **The locus of the offering of the soul in śaraṇāgati.**
-   **having all entities other than **Viṣṇu** for her body.**
-   **The attribute of **Viṣṇu**.**
-   **The mother of all.**
-   **The giver of unalloyed bliss and hence the means.**
-   **The impeller of **Viṣṇu** for removing those karmās of the soul
    which are evil.**
-   **being subservient, controlled, dependent and supported by
    **Viṣṇu** by their own will**
-   **ruling over all entities other than **Viṣṇu**.**

are the essential qualities being propounded by *Deśika* in his commentary

## Conclusion

Therefore, one need not doubt that the great seers of *Ahobila maṭham* expounded a different *sampradāya* initially or tried to change to *Vedānta deśika* views to suit a different sect altogether. Let us surrender at the feet of *Mālolan* who is with lakṣmi in his lap and the author *Nārāyaṇa yatīndra mahādeśikan* Himself to get rid of our inner darkness which causes all types of confusions.
