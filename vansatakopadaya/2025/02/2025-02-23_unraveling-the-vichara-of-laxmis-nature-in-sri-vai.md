In Śri Vaiṣṇava Sampradaya, Śri, Lakṣmi or as is called in Tamil̥ “Pirāṭṭi” plays a very important role. From the outside – this might seem quite uniform and simple from the outside, and it sure is uniform in many aspects. But a Key difference arose on the nature of Lakṣmi’s nature. These differences seems to have existed for long, and after the so-called “Schism” in Śri Vaiṣṇava tradition, the two traditions that arose – Vaḍakalai and Thenkalai ācāryās came to support each of the two Pakṣas.

These differences, though played down in Initial days by great ācāryās, arose to become key points of debates between the two traditions starting from the 16th century. Works of *Sakśāt svāmi* writing a counter to the *puruśakāra mīmāmsa* belonging to *Ahobila Matha-Deśika Sampradāya* over a minor difference and other works belonging to *Thennācārya sampradāya* called *Śri Tattva Siddhanjana*. This in turn was criticised by a commentary on *puruśakāra mīmāmsa* called *Maṇidipika*.

The same book seems to have triggered a flood of criticisms and counter-criticisms. More than 20 books have been authored either supporting the views of *Deśika* or that of *Nārāyaṇāchan Pillai* starting with *aṇutva puruṣakāratva samarthana, aṇutva culaka, aṇutva samarthana, lakṣmī vibhutva samarthana, lakṣmī upāyatva nirāsa, lakṣmī upāyatva samarthana, lakṣmī upāyatva dīpa, lakṣmī vibhutva khaṇḍana, śrī brahmatva vyudāsa, śri brahmatva samarthana, śri tattva Darpaṇa, śri tattva dipa, Lakṣmi mangala Dipika, Lakṣmi samāradhana sangraha, śri upāyatva samarthana, Lakṣmi sharanyatva, Lakṣmi upāyatva vicara* etc.

Of-late a few vidvāns put a new theory that the *pakśa* of *Vedānta Deśika* was the 4th and not the 5th one as is generally accepted, to appropriate his views. This led to new fights and debates which continue endlessly at least among vidvat circles until today.

While it might seem entertaining to some, the common layman is often confused, with so many opposing views being set in and becoming shaky. How far are such debates relevant to the modern world? Only time can tell. Is there no other way to settle this? Let us discuss in this blog some aspects of this vicāra.

## **Theories on Lakṣmī’s Nature**

Vedānta Deśika, in his Catuśślokī Bhāṣya, documents five different theories about Lakṣmī’s nature:

1.  Atomic in nature, belonging to the category of jīva 2.  All-pervasive (vibhu) but considered among jīvas 3.  All-pervasive but distinct from sentient, insentient matter, and
    Īśvara tattva 4.  All-pervasive, belonging to Īśvara tattva, naturally subservient to
    Īśvara 5.  All-pervasive and Īśvarī, subservient to Īśvara by mutual agreement

Venkaṭanātha (Vedānta Deśika) concludes that one of these views has all sufficient scriptural evidence but refrains from specifying here which one to avoid unnecessary debates.

## **Reconciliation for the Common Man**

Given the complexity of the topic, Ācāryas have categorized sampradāyic knowledge into two groups:

1.  Essential knowledge for understanding the philosophy 2.  Knowledge that, even if unclear, doesn’t significantly impact the
    attainment of mokṣa

Śrī Vedānta Deśika emphasizes in his Rahasyatraya Sāra:

> *“upayukteṣu vaiśadyaṃ trivarga nirapekṣatā \|  
> * *karaṇatrayasārūpyam iti saukhya rasāyanam \|\|” – Tattvatraya
> chintanādhikara*

This verse suggests that the key to a happy life is knowing what knowledge is essential, being indifferent to worldly pursuits, and aligning one’s mind, speech, and actions.

## **Essential Aspects of Lakṣmī Tattva**

Deśika states in Catuśślokī Bhāṣya:

> *“ihaiva kavidaṃśe tu saṃśaye’pi vipaścitām \|  
> * *upayuktāṃśa vaiśadyāt upāya phala saṃbhavaḥ \|\|”*

He asserts that even if learned individuals have doubts about some of Lakṣmī’s attributes, agreement on important aspects ensures the attainment of the means and the end.

## **Vedānta Deśika’s Conclusion**

In the Catuśślokī Bhāṣya, Deśika concludes:

> *“atra svāmitva saulabhya phaladatva phalatvataḥ \|  
> * *ānurūpyeṇa saṃbandhaḥ śrīpatau darśitaḥ śriyaḥ \|\|”*

This verse emphasizes the relationship between Lakṣmī and Viṣṇu in terms of lordship, and accessibility, being the means, and the end.

Sākṣāt Svāmi comments on this:

> *“upayukta aṃśavaiśadyāt upāyaphalasaṃbhavaḥ iti uttara vākyāt
> avasīyate, yathā vapurādiṣu yo’pi ko’pi vā iti śloke alasānām
> āstikānām ātmayāthātmya kārtsnyanirhāraṇa abhāve’pi nitya nirupādhika
> śeṣitva avadhāraṇa mātreṇa api upāyapūrtiḥ syāt iti anugṛhyate \|” –
> Śri tattva siddhanjanam*

This commentary explains that even without complete knowledge of the soul’s nature, understanding one’s dependence on Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is sufficient for surrender.

Yāmunāchārya mentions in Stotraratnam (śloka 52) that even if Āstikas don’t have in-depth knowledge of the soul’s absolute nature, understanding their dependence on Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is sufficient for surrender.

> *“vapurādiṣu yo’pi ko’pi vā guṇato’sāni yathātathāvidhaḥ .*
>
> *tadayaṃ tava pādapadmayorahamadyaiva mayā samarpitaḥ ” –
> Stotraratnam*

Sākṣāt Svāmi in Śrī Tattva Siddhāñjanam identifies three crucial aspects:

1.  Śeṣitva: Lakṣmī rules and controls overall alongside Bhagavān 2.  Śaraṇyatva: She is to be surrendered to 3.  Upeyatva: She is the final goal of all

Both Teṅkalai and Vaḍakalai sampradāyas accept these aspects, though their interpretations may vary. Pillai Lokācārya in Mumukṣuppadi states:

> *“ivaḷōṭē kūṭiyē vastuviṉuṭaiya uṇmai.”*

This Tamil quote affirms the inseparable nature of Lakṣmī in all of Viṣṇu’s states.

Sākṣāt Svāmi further adds:

> *“tathā ca sarvasminapi pakṣe pativiśeṣanatayā patnyāḥ api
> śeṣitvaśaraṇyatva prāpyatvāni santi tatpratipādanaprādhanaiva
> catuśślokī teṣāṃ parijñānameva ca mumukṣorupayuktam \|
> aṇutvavibutvajīvatveśvaratvādikaṃ tu na atyanta upayuktam \|” – Śri
> tattva siddhanjanam*

This commentary emphasizes that in all views of Śrī Vaiṣṇavism theology, Lakṣmī is accepted as an essential attribute of Nārāyaṇa in being the śeṣi, the means, and the goal. The specifics of Her nature (atomic, all-pervasive, jīva, or Īśvara) are not crucial for the layman.

## **Reconciliation Between Sects**

Kumāra Varadācārya in Virodhi Parihāram states:

> *“ata eva śrīmallakṣmaṇācārya-saṃpradāyasthaḥ sarvācāryairapi
> guruparaṃparānusandhāne puruṣakāratvena pūrva anusandhāya punarapi
> śaraṇāgatimantra upakrame śaraṇya-viśeṣaṇatvenāpi śrīmacchabdaḥ
> prayujyate \| māturhi sāparādhaṃ prati puruṣakārabhūtāyāḥ
> putrasaṃrakṣaṇe sahakāritvaṃ yujyata eveti sarvaṃ avadātam \|”*

Therefore in practice all ācāryas belonging to Rāmānuja sampradāya during śaraṇāgati request lakṣmi as the mediatrix during meditation of the lineage of teachers, and again in the beginning of śaraṇāgati mantra take her as an attribute of the protector. It is clear that a mother does mediation with the father for the sake of her son who has committed a mistake, and protects the son along withherspouse.

This passage emphasizes the importance of reconciling differences between sects by focusing on the accepted aspects necessary for surrender.

The author of Puruṣakāra Mīmāṃsā emphasizes a holistic approach:

*“lokācāryaprabandhasya trayīsārasya cobhayoḥ \|  
* *prāyo budhaiḥ aikakaṇṭhyaṃ grāhyaṃ granthajñasaṃmatam \|\|”*

This verse calls for unity among scholars in understanding both Lokācārya’s works and the essence of the works of Vedanta Deśika.

> āpādacūḍamanapāyini darśaneʼsmin āśāsanīyamaparaṃ na vipakṣaheto:,
> āpādaśāntimadhurānpunarasmadīyān anyonyavairajananīvijahātvasūyā.
>
> – Vedānta Deśika
