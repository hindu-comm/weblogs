### Introduction and context

The 1st prapāṭhaka of āraṇyaka in the taittirīya śākhā is well known for its adulation of the sūryamaṇḍalamadhyavartī , śrīmannārāyaṇa.  
It has its use in the shrauta ritual of āruṇaketukacayana which is an atidesa of the more famous agni cayana ritual.

### Viṣṇu as Protector of Heaven and Earth

Of particular interest is the observation by sage vatsa of the greatness of viṣṇu here. We shall look at it and analyze the statements of the veda bhāṣyakāras

> अनवर्णे इ॑मे भू॒मी । इ॒यं चा॑सौ च॒ रोद॑सी ।
>
> किꣳस्विदत्रान्त॑रा भू॒तम् । ये॒नेमे वि॑धृते॒ उभे।
>
> वि॒ष्णुना॑ विधृ॑ते भू॒मी । इ॒ति व॑थ्सस्य॒ वेद॑ना ।

The mantra is in the form of a question and answer, establishing the supremacy of viṣṇu.

The meaning goes as follows:

Who is the person who keeps the beautiful Earth and Heaven separated and supported?

The answer goes:

These two are supported by none other than viṣṇu, this is the conclusion of Vatsa.

The passage goes further on:

> इरा॑वती धेनु॒मती॒ हि भू॒तम् ।  
सू॒य॒व॒सिनी॒ मनु॑षे दश॒स्ये᳚ ॥
>
> व्य॑ष्टभ्ना॒द्रोद॑सी॒ विष्ण॑वे॒ते ।  
दा॒धर्थ॑ पृथि॒वीम् अ॒भितो॑ म॒यूखैः᳚ ॥

Heaven and Earth became abundant with food, cows, grass, creepers etc for the benefit of humans in both worlds. Oh viṣṇu ! you protect the Earth along with the Heavens with your glances from all sides.

### Strength, Brilliance, and the Supreme Abode of Viṣṇu

> किन्तद्विष्णोर्ब॑लमा॒हुः । का॒ दीप्तिः॑ किं प॒राय॑णम् ।
>
> एको॑ य॒द्धार॑यद्दे॒वः। रे॒जती॑ रोद॒सी उ॑भे ।

This is again in the form of a question. The mantra asks:

What(How much) is the strength of viṣṇu, what is the measure of His brilliance and what is His resting abode? He who is the matchless one by whom the worlds get their radiance.

> वाताद्विष्णोर्ब॑लमा॒हुः । अ॒क्षरा᳚द्दीप्ति॒रुच्य॑ते ।
>
> त्रि॒पदा॒द्धार॑यद्दे॒वः । यद्विष्णो॑रेक॒मुत्त॑मम् ॥
>
> अ॒ग्नयो॑ वाय॑वश्चै॒व । ए॒तद॑स्य प॒राय॑णम् ।

The answer comes in the following mantras:

The strength of viṣṇu is said to be more than that of wind. The brilliance of viṣṇu is said to be more than that of akshara i.e agni. Due to the capacity of agni to burn up perishables and grow without any sign of diminishment it is said to be akshara. The following mention of agni along with vAyu also makes this appropriate. Alternatively akshara can also refer to his abode which is said to be brighter than the sun and fire as described in this shloka.

> अत्यर्कानलदीप्तं तत्स्थानं विष्णोर्महात्मनः ।
>
> स्वयैव प्रभया राजन्दुष्प्रेक्ष्यं देवदानवैः ॥ (Mbh 3.160.19)

For the third question: His chief abode is the tripAd vibhUti, from where he rules over the material constituents, which include all forms of agni such as fire, sun, stars, lightning etc as well as forms of vAyu such as prANa, apAna, wind,gale etc.

### Some observations on meaning given by sāyana and bhaṭṭa bhāskara here:

Both commentators understand the question as inquiring into the source of Viṣṇu’s strength, brilliance, and sustaining power. They respond by attributing his strength to the wind, his brilliance to the imperishable, and so forth. Yet such an interpretation appears strained and fails to capture the true intent of the passage. When the inquiry concerns the power of the One who upholds the entire universe, it is implausible that this power should be derived from entities themselves limited within the cosmos. The text explicitly identifies Him as the sole supporter (एको॑ य॒द्धार॑यद्दे॒वः). To interpret the ablative merely in the sense of ‘source,’ as the commentators do, undermines the very purpose of the question.

vāyu is well known as one of the the fastest and strongest entities in shruti

> वायुर्वै क्षेपिष्ठा देवता(T.S 2.1.1) ,सर्वमाददीय यदिदं पृथिव्यामिति
> ॥(Kenopanishad 3.9)

Similarly agni is known for his brilliance

> *अग्ने॑ तेजस्विन्तेज॒स्वी त्वं दे॒वेषु॑ भूया: (T.S 3.3.1)*

Therefore we have taken the meaning of the ablative as relating to comparison rather than source here. Another topic too of interest is the diety related to these mantras.

### Examining Bhaṭṭa Bhāskara’s views

Commentators such as Bhaṭṭa Bhāskara construe this passage as referring to the Sun, on the grounds that both the antecedent and subsequent verses are concerned with solar imagery. By virtue of its immediate contextual setting, this verse too is thus interpreted in the same light. 

This isn’t a correct approach. The context comes into play only in the absence of any other supporting evidence for the same. However, the kalpa sutra points out these mantras to be referring to viṣṇu only.

“किंस्विदत्रेति पञ्च वैष्णवी:” says the bodhāyana śrauta sūtra (BSS 19.10) indicating that the mantras are for viṣṇu in this place. sāyana too observes while discussing about the sage vatsa :

> “वत्सो हि स्मृतिकर्ता स च विष्णुमेव द्यावापृथिव्योर्विधारकं स्मरति”

The meanings given by Bhatta Bhaskara are additionally against the natural meaning of the mantra starting with “इरा॑वती धेनु॒मती॒ हि भू॒तम्”. This mantra comes in ṛgveda (7.99.3) as well as the kṛṣṇa yajurveda saṃhitā(TS 1.2.13). The mantra is interpreted as denoting viṣṇu only in both the places. The corresponding brāhmaṇa as well as kalpa sutra prayoga for the same keep viṣṇu only as the devata –

> वर्त्म॑ना॒ वा अ॒न्वित्य॑ य॒ज्ञꣳ रक्षाꣳ॑सि जिघाꣳसन्ति
> वैष्ण॒वीभ्या॑मृ॒ग्भ्यां वर्त्म॑नोर्जुहोति य॒ज्ञो वै
> विष्णु॑र्य॒ज्ञादे॒व रक्षा॒ग्॒स्यप॑ हन्ति॒ (TS 6.2.1).

It is to be noted here that the context plays no role in deciding the devatā. The previous mantras in the saṃhitā had references to savitā. However this mantra is not taken to as a similar reference based on the brāhmaṇa.

Furthermore sūrya cannot be said to have loka dhārakatva too in an absolute sense. The taittirīya upaniṣad refers to sūrya as one of the 5 dieties which work in fear of Brahman.

> “भी॒षाऽस्मा॒द्वातः॑ पवते । भी॒षोदे॑ति॒ सूर्यः॑ ।
> भीषाऽस्मादग्नि॑श्चेन्द्र॒श्च । मृत्युर्धावति पञ्च॑म इ॒ति”(Taittriya
> Upanishad 2.8.1)

For the same reason the following mantras starting with अ॒मुमा॑हुः प॑रं मृ॒त्युम् .. in Taittriya āraṇyaka too dont refer to sūrya. It is Brahman(viṣṇu) alone which as per the Kathopanishad statement “यस्य ब्रह्म च क्षत्रं च उभे भवत ओदन: मृत्युर्यस्योपसेचनम्”(Kathopanishad 1.2.25) as well as the above taittirīya upaniṣad statement, who is aptly called as param mrutyum. This is borne out by the upabṛṃhaṇa occurring in the Nrusimha Tapaniya upanishad as well as the mantraraja padam stotram:

> “य आत्मदा बलदा यस्य विश्व उपासते प्रशिषं यस्य
>
> देवाः यस्य छायामृतं यो मृत्युमृत्युः कस्मै
>
> देवाय हविषा विधेम तस्मादुच्यते मृत्युमृत्युमिति ॥”(Nrusimha Purva
> Tapini 2.13)

> “साक्षात्स्वकाले सम्प्राप्तं मृत्युं शत्रुगणानपि ।
>
> भक्तानां नाशयेद्यस्तु मृत्युमृत्युं नमाम्यहम् ॥”(Mantrarajapada
> stotram-9 )

Therefore the deity denoted as “मृत्युमती:” too is none other than viṣṇu.

### Evidence from other shrutis and smṛtis

There are several other reasons why the context cannot denote sūrya. Apart from the taittirīya upaniṣad passage, the puruṣa sūkta too tells that sūrya was born from the purusha viṣṇu. “चक्षोः सूर्यो अजायत”(Rig Veda 10.90.13). This is aided by other passages from the taittirīya brāhmaṇa, Rig Veda etc- “सू॒र्या॒च॒न्द्र॒मसौ॑ धा॒ता य॑थापू॒र्वम॑कल्पयत्”(Rig Veda 10.190.3), “अग्निर्मूर्धा चक्षुषी चन्द्रसूर्यौ”(muṇḍakopaniṣad 2.1.4),“येन॒ सूर्य॒स्तप॑ति॒ तेज॑से॒द्धः”(taittirīya brāhmaṇa 3.12.9),“न तत्र सूर्यो भाति न चन्द्रतारकम्(muṇḍakopaniṣad 2.2.11)”,“यस्यादित्यः शरीरम्”(bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad 3.7.9), “यस्यादित्यो भामुपयुज्य भाति”, “एको ह वै नारायण आसीन्न ब्रह्मा नेशानो नापो नाग्नीषोमौ नेमे द्यावापृथिवी न नक्षत्राणि न सूर्यो न चन्द्रमा:” (mahopaniṣad 1.1) These also have supporting upabṛṃhaṇa from smṛtis such as the gītā:

> “न तद्भासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावक:।
>
> यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥”(Bhagavad gītā 15.6)

The same aruNa prashna goes on to call sūrya as created by the puruṣa

> तत्पुरु॑षस्य पुरुष॒त्वम् । स स॒हस्र॑शीर्षा॒ पुरु॑षः ।
> स॒ह॒स्रा॒क्षस्स॒हस्र॑पात् । भू॒त्वोद॑तिष्ठत् ।  
> तम॑ब्रवीत् । त्वं वै पूर्वꣳ॑ सम॑भूः । त्वमि॒दं पूर्वः॑ कुरु॒ष्वेति॑ ।
> स इ॒त आ॒दायापः॑। अ॒ञ्ज॒लिना॑ पु॒रस्ता॑दु॒पाद॑धात् । ए॒वाह्ये॒वेति॑ ।
> तत॑ आदि॒त्य उद॑तिष्ठत् ।सा प्राची॒ दिक् ।

All these explicit statements go on to show that sūrya is indeed limited in pervasion and hence cannot be denoted by the term viṣṇu or paraṃ mṛtyu in shruti.

![](https://vansatakopadaya.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chatgpt-image-aug-16-2025-03_10_27-pm-1.png?w=683)

We have some statements like “सूर्य॑ आ॒त्मा जग॑तस्त॒स्थुष॑श्च” which shows that sūrya is the soul and controller of the universe.This too has to be reconciled with many other statements which affirm that sūrya is created and under control of other entities. This has to be interpreted along with statements such as “यस्यादित्यः शरीरम्”. Further support of this verse not being absolutely applicable for the diety sūrya comes from the vālmīki rāmāyaṇa:

> नैनम् सूर्य: प्रतपति पार्श्वे वाति न मारुत: ।  
> चलोर्मिमाली तं दृष्ट्वा समुद्रोऽपि न कंपते ॥(vālmīki rāmāyaṇa 1.15.10)

Therefore the word सूर्य here doesnt denote the sun but the paramātmā Viṣṇu alone who has the sun as his body. Therefore it is justified as being the soul of all beings. Alternatively, as all names belong to viṣṇu alone by the upabṛṃhaṇa

> “वेदे रामायणे पुण्ये भारते भरतर्षभ।
>
> आदौ चान्ते च मध्ये च हरिः सर्वत्र गीयते॥”(Mbh 18.6.93)

and the sutra:

> साक्षादप्यविरोधं जैमिनि: (Brahma Sutra 1.2.29)

It is appropriate to take सूर्य itself etymologically as a name of viṣṇu. It is also rūḍhī for viṣṇu as supported by the viṣṇu sahasranama verse “रविर्विरोचनः सूर्यः सविता रविलोचनः”. Therefore the reason stated in the objection is inconclusive.

### Another alternative

Even if the context of the āraṇyaka hymns starting with अनवर्णे इ॑मे are taken to be references to a solar deity, it doesnt affect the fact that it refers to viṣṇu. It is well known that viṣṇu is one of the dvadasha ādityas which is one of his incarnations. (आदित्यानामहं विष्णु:
-Bhagavad gītā 10.21 ). Therefore there is no issue with regards to the context by any means as told by bhaṭṭa bhāskara.

Hence we need not doubt that the mantras of the āraṇyaka refer to viṣṇu as the supreme controller and bearer of the entire universe along with the planets and stars.
