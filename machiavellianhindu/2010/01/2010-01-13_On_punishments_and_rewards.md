**Introduction**

Because every crime is harmful, to the individual or the association, it has to be punished, for with no punishment, the committing of crimes would never abate, and this would lead to eventual destruction of society. On this, Kauṭilya says:

> Whoever imposes severe punishment becomes repulsive to the people; > while he who awards mild punishment becomes contemptible. But whoever > imposes punishment as deserved becomes respectable. For punishment > when awarded with due consideration, makes the people devoted to > righteousness and to works productive of wealth and enjoyment; while > punishment, when ill-awarded under the influence of greed and anger or > owing to ignorance, excites fury even among hermits and ascetics > dwelling in forests, not to speak of householders. But when the law of > punishment is kept in abeyance, it gives rise to such disorder as is > implied in the proverb of fishes (mātsyanyāya); for in the absence of > a magistrate, the strong will swallow the weak; but under his > protection, the weak resist the strong. >
> -Arthaśāstra 1.4.8-1.4.15, translation by R Shamasastri

On rewards, he says:

> It is the ruler in whom the duties of both Indra (the rewarder) and > Yama (the punisher) are blended, and he is a visible dispenser of > punishments and rewards. >
> -Arthaśāstra 1.13.10, translation by R Shamasastri

And also,

> He is ever ready to bestow rewards on the worthy and inflict > punishments on the wicked. >
> -Arthaśāstra 8.1.15, Translation by R Shamasastri

Machiavelli in his Discourses on Livy, says:

> The merits of Horatius were very great, since with his virtue he had > conquered the Curiatii; his fault was atrocious, since he had killed > his sister. Nonetheless, such a homicide so greatly displeased the > Romans that they brought him to trial for his life, notwithstanding > that his merits were so great and so fresh. >
> To whoever considers it superficially, such a thing would appear an > example of popular ingratitude; nonetheless, whoever examines it > better and inquires with better consideration what the orders of > republics should be will blame that people rather for having absolved > him than for having wished to condemn him. The reason is this: that no > well-ordered republic ever cancels the demerits with the merits of its > citizens; but, having ordered rewards for a good work and punishments > for a bad one, and having rewarded one for having worked well, if that > same one later works badly, it punishes him without any regard for his > good works. When these orders are well observed, a city lives free for > a long time; otherwise it will always come to ruin soon. For if a > citizen has done some outstanding work for the city, and on top of the > reputation that this thing brings him, he has an audacity and > confidence that he can do some work that is not good without fearing > punishment, in a short time he will become so insolent that any > civility will be dissolved. >
> If one wishes the punishment for malevolent works to be kept up, it is > indeed necessary to observe the giving of rewards for good ones, as it > was seen in what Rome did. >
> Although a republic may be poor and able to give little, it should not > abstain from that little; for every small gift given to anyone, in > recompense for a good however great, will always be esteemed by him > who receives it as honorable and very great. >
> -Niccolò Machiavelli, Discourses on Livy, Book 1, Chapter 23, Harvey > C. Mansfield's translation.

The reasoning behind it says that if one were to be full of merit, and reputed in the state, he could end up using this very reputation to commit crimes, since, in Machiavelli’s view, men can not secure themselves, except with power, which is seen on the first chapter of the first book in Discourses.

This shall be enough, with regard to Machiavelli, on punishments.

According to Han Fei:

> The means whereby the intelligent ruler controls his ministers are two > handles only. The two handles are chastisement and commendation. >
> What are meant by chastisement and commendation? To inflict death or > torture upon culprits, is called chastisement; to bestow > encouragements or rewards on men of merit, is called commendation. >
> Ministers are afraid of censure and punishment but fond of > encouragement and reward. Therefore, if the lord of men uses the > handles of chastisement and commendation, all ministers will dread his > severity and turn to his liberality. >
> Now supposing the lord of men placed the authority of punishment and > the profit of reward not in his hands but let the ministers administer > the affairs of reward and punishment instead, then everybody in the > country would fear the ministers and slight the ruler, and turn to the > ministers and away from the ruler. This is the calamity of the ruler's > loss of the handles of chastisement and commendation. >
> That which enables the tiger to subject the dog, is his claws and > fangs. Supposing the tiger cast aside its claws and fangs and let the > dog use them, the tiger would in turn be subjected by the dog. The > lord of men controls his ministers by means of chastisement and > commendation. Now supposing the ruler of men cast aside the handles of > chastisement and commendation and let the ministers use them, the > ruler would in turn be controlled by the ministers. >
> Every sovereign molested, murdered, deluded, or deceived, because he > had lost the handles of chastisement and commendation and let the > ministers use them, invited danger and ruin accordingly. >
> -Han Feizi, Book 2, Chapter 7, W.K. Liao's translation.

On this recommendation of Han Fei, a question may arise, for Machiavelli says in the Prince, Chapter 19:

> Among the well-ordered and governed kingdoms in our times is that of > France; and in it are infinite good institutions on which the liberty > and security of the king depend. The first of these is the parlement > and its authority. For the one who ordered that kingdom, knowing the > ambition of the powerful and their insolence, and judging it necessary > for them to have a bit in their mouths to correct them, and on the > other side, knowing the hatred of the generality of people against the > great, which is founded in its fear, and wanting to secure them, > intended this not to be the particular concern of the king, so as to > take from him the blame he would have from the great when he favored > the popular side, and from the popular side when he favored the great; > and so he constituted a third judge to be the one who would beat down > the great and favor the lesser side without blame for the king. This > order could not be better, or more prudent, or a greater cause of the > security of the king and the kingdom. From this one can infer another > notable thing: that princes should have anything blameable > administered by others, favors by themselves. >
> -The Prince, Niccolò Machiavelli, translated by Harvey C. Mansfield

While Han Fei says that both should flow from the prince. What is to be done then?

**On this, Machiavellian Hindu says:**

Punishments and rewards are necessary, to encourage good and to discourage evil. Punishments given proportionately keep everything in order, and do not cause outrage or chaos. Punishments are not to be substituted by a past reward, and without regard to the reputation of the convict, they are to be inflicted, for it keeps the state free, and does not lead it to ruin. The handles of punishment and rewards, are those which keep the sovereign, or the republic, in paramount position, and make the subordinates and subjects, or in the case of the republic, citizens and non citizens, always perform actions which invite rewards to facilitate a life lived in accordance with the good.

If either handle is left in the hands of the subordinates, then the subordinates would become powerful, not the sovereign. But if the ruler is seen as being the one to punish all the time, then it may make him excessive, and hated in certain cases.

*On this, the solution may be said to be as follows:*

In the case of Machiavelli, from which he draws his inference of leaving punishments in the hands of others, the province of France has a rivalry between the notables and the masses. To become a partisan of either side makes the sovereign liable to be overthrown, because men do not know how to be content except by conquest, as was said.

Where the sovereign is paramount over both the notables and the masses, with him having a greater standing than both, whether these two have a rivalry or not, he should be the one having both the handles.

But where the sovereign has lesser power, making him equal to the other notables, or dependant upon them for maintaining his position, he should leave punishments in the hands of a third party which is the judge, since the king too, in general, belongs to the notables. This judge rewards punishments to the guilty from both the masses and the notables, thus keeping the king free from any censure by both the sides.

Where the conflict between the notables and the masses does not exist, the sovereign must endeavour to establish his supremacy, and to be the sole holder of the two handles.
