# Against The Longtermism Argument Which Endorses Monarchic Forms

### Why it is fallacious to assume that a monarch will rule for the common good, and a fixed term head magistrate will not.

While we have spoken [in defense of democratic forms](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/democracy-is-not-pernicious-when), mixed or pure, the argument of longtermism which endorses monarchy and unfairly criticizes democracy, deserves a second look.

For this, we shall assume that in a monarchy, the ruler of men exists alone as a power center, with any vassals as well as councils of administrators and ministers being subordinate, and their opinions being purely advisory, and not binding upon him. For fairness, we assume such a ruler to be one who is effective in bringing prosperity and strength to his state.

On the other hand, we shall assume the democratic form to be mixed or pure, where mixed assumes that the democratic form exists along with elements of aristocratic, oligarchic as well as monarchic natures in its government. Apart from this, we shall assume that the people are not corrupted, but are virtuous enough to produce many statesmen.

Now both governments being at their best, we will compare their realities then.

#### Arguments of the Monarchists

Now the argument cited by the modern monarchists, says that in democracies, the rites are held in disdain, while money becomes the prime concern. To endorse their system, they say that when the ruler is secure in his position, his descendants too will be secure, and thus, to keep themselves secure, they will work for the welfare of the people.

But the assumptions made do not hold true for all the times, and for this, one needs to presuppose many things, and take into account the circumstances.

#### Claims to being a Democracy

Why the various other nations claiming to be democratic, in history and the present are not, is seen when one examines the names and their reality, as Han Fei tells us in his Dao of the Sovereign[1](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-1-93327656).

To speak of it briefly, one may point back to what Aristotle[2](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-2-93327656) says that democracies are those governments where the populace rules and is ruled in turn. This when applied, means that when the populace is ruled, it is ruled by the various magistrates who are in charge of various functions, which Kautilya[3](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-3-93327656) and Aristotle[4](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-4-93327656) list in their constitutions, though in a democracy, the magistrates are taken from the people at large.

But when the populace rules, is only possible when the many gather together and are able to give decisions which are binding on its “rulers”, and these of a necessity have to be obeyed. Such decisions[5](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-5-93327656) are those relating to war and peace; diplomatic relations; legislation; decisions of : exile, death penalty, confiscation of goods; audit and election of magistrates. This last is where the ruling part manifests the most directly, but other than this, the part of a populace in law making too is important, as will be seen below.

#### The Population of Statesmen

The argument of monarchists, that in absence of a king, the strong devour the weak, may well not be considered as an explicit endorsement, for the king may be replaced by any effective form of government, be it an oligarchy, like one party states of today, or be they mixed governments, like Sparta and Rome, as well as Switzerland, or it may be ruled as a pure democracy, like Athens, and the argument would hold either way.

But to come to the main argument, the monarchists say that a king and his bloodline would work for the welfare of citizens, and being secure, they will not need to worry for they are supreme.

They blame a democracy of the kind practiced in most of the world, as being one which only encourages plunder and private benefit, for the certainty of staying long term does not exist for the magistrates, since they must relinquish if they are beaten in electoral races.

But this view is fallacious, for it assumes all monarchs to be the most prudent, and the magistrate in a democracy to be the most corrupt. The other fallacy is to assume that there is only one type of democracy, which is the same as what Socrates assumes in the Platonic corpus, as noted by Aristotle.[6](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-6-93327656)

Both of these opinions, being held by people, are due to a delusion, which is only due to not examining the form and the name.

But for fairness, it is only prudent to take an uncorrupted yet virtuous people as the benchmark for a democratic form, not the corrupted, and likewise, let the king be uncorrupted yet virtuous, so that when taken equally at their best, their comparison is fair.

Now Kauṭilya holds that a republic is free from the calamities of anarchy[7](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-7-93327656), though given the absence of a mixed republic, his statement applies to the oligarchies of ancient India, yet given that the statement refers to sovereignty residing with a clan being so effective, how much more effective is it when sovereignty resides with many more!

This absence of anarchy is so, because though the absolutely virtuous are always few, the presence of virtue varies and through the arrangement of reciprocal rule, the government of many, living in liberty, regulates itself; needing no masters over it, it becomes master over others, as was seen with how Rome shaped our world, and how Athens shaped the Hellenic world.

This virtuous people neither serves humbly, nor dominates proudly. When peoples and the prince, both are virtuous, it is said that there, the people is much more stable and prudent, with a better judgement than that of a prince. It is due to a long and sustained memory of events, and its virtue produces such a marvelous effect, that it chooses the best men as its magistrates, and not those who have only a semblance of virtue, and obeys them when it is necessary for public safety. This arises on account of its increased ability to foresee good and bad, and its sense of liberty is so strong that it punishes without mercy, those who dare to usurp its freedom. And finally, when the states of such people overthrew the kingly name, they made great gains in a short time, like Athens, and Rome, where the former became the basis of Hellenic high culture, while the latter made such an empire whose customs informed the understanding of many future generations.

But on the other hand, what the people are accused of, even the princes may be accused of the same, and that most princes are not esteemed wise, but only a few are. This may be seen in how only a few princes have been notable enough to be immortalized, like the pharaohs of Egypt, or the five good emperors and the first two kings of Rome, or even the kings of the far East, and Han Fei says that exceptional talent is not the norm among kings, but average talent is much more prevalent, for princes like Yao or Jie arise only once in a thousand generations, while most remain average or below average[8](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-8-93327656). But in peoples, this very average adds up to create exceptional excellence; for since individuals vary, their combined wisdom is so grand, that it overshadows the wisdom of one, unless that one be a divine figure.

One might answer that only in a part of the world have there been popular governments which have worked, and that it has been disastrous elsewhere, but to this, we say that the variations in peoples and princes are always the same, and this is because both can err when the laws do not shackle them, but the evil committed by a prince is far greater than that committed by the people.

And Machiavelli concludes, that when both are bound by laws, the virtue of the people is greater than that of the prince, and when both are unbound, the people are less pernicious than a prince. This is because unbound peoples are not wise, but unbound princes are crazy. The cure for people’s folly is persuasion by a sage, but for a prince’s madness, is death. From the former malady, the future is feared because a tyrant can rise from it, but from the latter, the future is hopeful, because there, one may get relief. Let this be enough to show what may happen if power stays in the hands of one alone, and for life.

If one sees excesses of the people at times, it is because the people are cruel to those who endanger their common good, the prince to those who endanger his own good. But the opinions against princes are spoken with great hesitation and fear while they rule, and opinions against the people are spoken with impunity while they rule.

But to conclude, all these good effects arise only on account of the popular government being better than the kingly, for even if a prince may order laws better than the peoples, the peoples maintain laws and orders better than a prince.

So from these opinions, one gathers, that when a people is ordered well, it will always cause greater glory than the prince, for their fatherland, and this arises only on account of them being well ordered, by their laws, education and customs.

From these words of Machiavelli[9](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-9-93327656), we now see that a gold standard for a statesman populace, is Rome, and for sound reasons. That no one ever pays attention to what made the Romans live free, is a calamity indeed.

#### Why Monarchist sentiments have increased

But why monarchist sentiment has risen today in countries which have hitherto been free, is a result of not rectifying the people. For when you have allowed corruption to travel freely within the people, by encouraging contact with those who are corrupted, and by encouraging oligarchs and warlords to take charge of wealth and authority, whether by suppressing the people through sophistries, or by force. Though these are harmful, none is actually more harmful than not solidifying the authority of the people, like the Swiss did, and in not taking this measure, the governments have endangered liberty, or what was always a semblance of it.

The other cause follows from the same corruption of the people, and is a result of indolence. It manifests in the sentiment of wanting a leader to take power in perpetuity, purely because one is unwilling to carry out his duties for the sake of the fatherland, and in most cases, it is caused by many factors, but happens mostly due to these: a bad education, customs which encourage one to be passive, and laws which make one not exert himself for meritorious deeds.

But to those who value their liberty, and are willing to discard private interest for public benefit, and to crush all the adversaries of theirs, who would usurp their freedom, there is no better way, than to emulate the republican Romans at their finest, for they gained a glorious empire, even as a republic, beating the Greeks, the Gauls, Carthage, the Italian cities and Egypt, while maintaining themselves uncorrupted until the time of the Gracchi, which was still almost four hundred years from the time of the first Brutus.

To add to this, we may see, that Han Fei talks of the Six Contrarieties[10](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-10-93327656), and says that the enlightened sovereign makes the laws, prohibitions, punishments and rewards clear, and this results in hegemony, prosperity and order. These being clear to the Romans, for their prohibition of monarchic opinions, their various laws and punishments which became the basis for so many of our systems, and the various rewards that it presented for exceptional actions, like crowns, wreaths, money and jewelry, apart from the various cognomen that exceptional citizens gained , all contributed to its hegemony.

As Han Fei tells us, rewards are not only given to the meritorious, but are used to encourage people to exert themselves, for the ones who gain it, enjoy their achievement, while the others are inspired to gain such rewards themselves.

In the same way, punishments are given not just to suppress the criminals, but also to terrify would be violators, as Guan Zhong says[11](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-11-93327656), and when punishment is given to the culprit, the ones who are terrified are good men, and this is on account of them fearing the consequences of criminal behavior.

#### Conclusion

To see our modern republics, and the dissatisfaction that exists, causing monarchic opinions to arise, is then, easy to sum up, as not being due to the lack of long-termism, for it is not long-termism which is the strength of monarchies, but the binding of the prince through laws, and when the people rule in the same way, bound by laws, they produce way greater effects, due to how much their virtue multiplies.

But today’s decay can be considered as being a result of the suppression of the popular element, which was done by the greatest sophistry ever, pulled off skillfully by the Anglos, though the Swiss did the better thing by preserving it. The other is a hatred of the people, though this arises on account of hating the people’s corruption and mistaking it to be the actual nature of the people, which even if it may be assumed as naturally corrupt, as by Xun Kuang[12](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-12-93327656) and Machiavelli[13](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/against-the-longtermism-argument#footnote-13-93327656), who nevertheless speak of measures to rectify the people, though a minority may well choose to endorse monarchic governments, purely out of convention, and finally, it may be reiterated, that monarchic forms, formal or effective, are warranted in countries where the people are unable to rule themselves as one community bound by laws, and of a necessity need a greater hand to guide them.

But to lovers of liberty, there is no other form, except for the one which includes the popular government as an essential element, which will ever suffice. But for those who have had a good beginning, and have been able to sustain their republics without tyrants suppressing them, yet are not close to the level of excellence that the form’s order demands, we shall see next year, in another piece, how the rectification of a people who is already established in liberty may proceed, and how a people, having set their mind to living in liberty, may be able to order it well, so that it lasts long.
