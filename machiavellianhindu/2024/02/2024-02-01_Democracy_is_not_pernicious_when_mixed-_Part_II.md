*Part 1 can be read [here](https://machiavellianhindu.substack.com/p/democracy-is-not-pernicious-when?sd=pf)*

Now it being established how the hereditary king and ritual eligibility of a popular government may be accomodated, this part will be a further elaboration on the criticisms of democracy by the Greeks and Romans, and will also focus on causes of faction and destruction of constitutions.

But before that, we may have a brief examination of certain systems of ancient and medieval India extolled as "democracies" in popular discourse, and determine whether they may be called a democracy, or is it wise to call them either mixed or even oligarchic constitutions, and we shall discount the independence status of such system viz. Whether this system flourishes under a king, or is it sovereign by itself, shall not matter.

**Is the claim to democracy correct?**

The mark of democratic institutions is that every freeborn man who is a franchise holder can participate in deliberation, become a magistrate and act as a judge in disputes, but at any rate, he gets to be a part of the deliberative assembly, whose decision is sovereign. But such may also be found in oligarchies, so what distinguishes them? Oligarchies are either open or closed. The ones which are open require one to be extremely rich, and in a partially open one, the rulers may choose from the rest of the populace, anyone, and give him a share in office, but this is not guaranteed. The closed oligarchies though, have hereditary succession to the offices of the state, and therefore, any and all paths to government duties are closed. These criteria restrict a large number of people from participating in government.

In democracies, since rule is by turns, and the members are very many, due to a very low or no property qualification, and as Aristotle tells us in his Politics, poor men are the mark of a democracy, we can distinguish both governments. Hereditary succession is never guaranteed in any democratic form, since offices do not get held for a long time by anyone, and the number of terms one can serve gets limited as well, though all freeborn members rich and poor, share in all three elements. This is why, though membership may be by birth, it does not take away from the democratic character.

**A study of two ancient constitutions**

Now we may take up the cases of the Licchavi gaṇarājya and Uttiramerur inscriptions, though it must be noted that depending on the era, Varṇa and other factors make it somewhat complicated to ascertain the exact nature of such systems.

Nevertheless, we should consider, as a standard for democracy, the eleven features spoken of by Aristotle, and listed in part 1, as marks of what makes a democracy a democracy, and hold every type of government that purports to be a democracy or is purported to be one by any writer to this standard, and not to any other, since this standard reflects clearly, the rule of the people, and not those others which proclaim it only in rhetoric and practice in effect, oligarchies.

**Licchavis**

Of the Licchavi, we get some information from the Tibetan dulva, that the inhabitants of Vaiśālī had 42000 houses divided into three districts in those times, where the main rulers were around 7000 men, 14000 men constituted the officials and 21000 men constituted the rest of the populace. Similar to this 7000, we get the ubiquitous legendary figure of 7707 kings from the Ekapanna Jataka.

Nevertheless, the data available to us, inferred or actual, especially from Dr. R.C. Majumdar's work on corporations tells us that these seven thousand or so kings belonged to just one clan, since we do not see more clan names linked in one city, and even if we took the entire leagues of these states as one state, it still shows that it was not democratic. In our country, especially among the Brāhmaṇa-s and Rājaputra-s, and likely among many other jāti-s, we have systems of finer clan divisions, of khaṁp, nakha and so on. This is also seen among the Athenians, where the phratry and genos system points to an analogous feature. A φρᾱτρῐ́ᾱ was a system which was based on a common link between many γένη and the latter were based on common ancestry from a hero and common religious rites. One can never fail to see striking similarities in this way, among these institutions and Indian ones.

But Dr. Majumdar makes some errors in his judgement, and specifically, of attributing representative democracy to Athens, which is false in toto. Maybe his assertion is due to the assembly not being composed of every citizen in Athens during the four monthly sessions, and since it was always a part which participated, maybe he infers wrongly that the ones who did were representatives, if he calls the citizens participating in the ekklesia as representatives in the sense of modern parliamentarians, though he correctly remarks that the demes were miniatures of the greater city, but beyond this he states, along with many other authors, contemporary and ancient, that India had many democratic states in antiquity. Of antiquity let the words of Strabo be enough:

> Generally speaking, the men who have written on the affairs of India were a set of liars >
> -Strabo, Geography

This claim of democratic states is fallacious and one probable cause is that these modern scholars were not extremely familiar with western political theory and did not consider constitutions like the Athenian, Roman or the Spartan as the benchmarks for democratic elements after establishing soundly, a theory of government types. While we know of some democratic notions, like the words of Aitareya Brāhmaṇa which say that uttara kuru and uttara madra had the entire populace dedicated to kingship, and this has uncanny resemblance to Aristotle's statement that the people together becomes a monarch in a democracy, one individual composed of many, this is not enough to ascertain everything, since the working of these states is not very well attested in archaeological or cultural records, and all that we know of them is tentative. Now as we move to real world examples, it will be clear.

Of the Licchavi city state in Vaishali, it would not be wise to call it a democratic institution, because we see that the franchise stayed only with the 7000 families, and it is said that the other men apart from the 7000 chiefs, are said to be mixed among all the varṇa-s, which tells us that not every kṣatriya is a chief in the city. Since the 7000 were the ones who were conducting all business, and the rest of the populace being mostly absent except when they could share in the government due to their wealth or being granted a share in government, but only as viceroys and other officials, it is oligarchic.

Though one may have known principles of majority voting and other things characteristic of modern state forms, because the people at large being disenfranchised from the three elements of government would mean that power is either monarchic or oligarchic. Had the government taken to democracy as stated by Aristotle, it would appear as an aberration in the entire region, and it may have influenced discourse very differently in India, for it may have made the principle of equality which is a part of democracy, gain familiarity with the thinkers, and we'd see either support or critique of democracy, like we do in the Western world.

**Uttiramerur**

In the Uttiramerur inscription, we see committees being made from elected men in each deme/kudumbu/ward, yet we do not see the participation of the assembly at large in more than watching the procedure of lot drawing. The committees may be said to be just boards of magistrates, but since they are always chosen from the pre elected ones, their selection is aristocratic, as Aristotle holds. This is further corroborated in the qualifications that are asked of them. One can then, call the system technically aristocratic, and not democratic, though it may use the lot to select magistrates. Had the role of assembly been extensive with its actions being binding on the committees, rather than just for hearing the announcement of an election, it may have qualified as a democratic practice, but without this, the term democracy for this is a misnomer, and the system is best characterized as an aristocratic institution.

**Caution is necessary before attribution**

So in brief, we can see that a truly democratic institution has not existed in India largely, and attribution of this term to systems which reflect an oligarchic or aristocratic character, whether it is either out of ignorance, or it is out of malice or even a sense of inferiority, when confronted by some who are equally guilty of not having systems where the popular element has extensive participation in government, we do not know, and it is best left to judgement of the reader to decide, once it is made clear what democracies are, through a rigorous study of the political theory of Aristotle, (who is considered a great philosopher, and called the first teacher by the Arabs) and applying it on all constitutions, past and present to judge them correctly as to their nature.

We should remember that voting a leader in power does not necessarily make any government a democracy, and to think that it does, is something which may be considered as a catastrophic folly which any sound mind must escape, by all means.

**Greek and Roman criticisms:**

As seen in the last part, Cicero criticises the democratic form as being one which culpably equalises people, brings down the great, and destroys distinction of rank.

Aristotle says that it is based on the notion of implied absolute equality, based on equality in one domain, which is free birth.

Now one draws two things from it:

One, that it equalises people without considering many factors, and only on one basis. The second is that the capable are always at the mercy of the majority, which is generally the poor, and that if the capable grow too much, they would have to be humbled, to maintain the liberty of the populace, which ends up destroying their greatness, and subsequently, any virtue they may still possess.

For this, the same writers say that a mixed form of government, which considers all the three good forms together, or even two(for aristocracy or oligarchy taken to an extreme lead to monarchy or tyranny respectively), and combines them to form one which resembles all of the constituents, and neither of them at the same time, would be the best.

This mixing is not as simple as the notion of “separation of powers” that exists in our times, which says that all three elements, deliberative, executive and judicial check each other. On the contrary, mixing a government well would imply that in all elements, the people and the great men would share, or they would share in some part, but not the others. However one mixes the constitution's three elements, one must ensure that in no way should exclusivity in one part of the government mean accumulation of extraordinary power.

Of this mixing, the best examples are Sparta and Rome in the ancient times.

In Sparta, we see the kings being absolutely sovereign only in war, and in peacetime, they held no authority. The affairs of the state were run by ephors, who were elected from the people at large, while the gerousia along with the Spartans, used to deliberate, and any law was always voted on by the populace of freeborn Spartans, as well as acting as the judicial element of the Spartan polis. Here we see the kingly power being manifested during wars alone, while the state can be said to be aristocratic when the gerousia deliberated and judged, and democratic since the ephors were much more powerful than the kings in peacetime, spying over the slaves and over the kings during war.

Rome on the contrary, made its magistrates sovereign in their domains, since the republic was built on constant wars, while it eventually gave the people at large, sovereignty in deliberation, through the plebeian council and the tribunes, although the senate was even more sovereign over the magistrates, except for the tribunes, though the tribunes could not override the general will of the people. The judges were varied according to jurisdiction, and the people were generally sovereign in public trials, while private suits were deputed to the praetor and various tribunals like the quaestiones perpetuae. Here one sees a kingly as well as aristocratic power in the magistrates, the aristocratic at work in the judicial and deliberative elements, and the democratic at work in deliberation and in the magistracies, mixed with the kingly power, as the tribunate.

Unfortunately, we do not know of any one government today which has a well mixed mode in the way above, which includes the great men and the masses together in the government. This will be made clear in the subsequent parts of this series. But before we get there, we should be clear as to what leads to preservation and ruin of constitutions.

And now, let us turn to the question of factions, for they result from a bad mixing of the constitutions.

**Factions**

Factions are held to be pernicious by everyone who deals with preservation of republics, and especially Machiavelli and Aristotle. As such, the root of factions is considered to be inequality. It works in two ways, as seen in Aristotle's work.

> Inequality is the root of factions. Those who have less, resort to > faction, and do so if they believe themselves to be equals to the > rich. Those who are rich resort to faction if they feel themselves to > be lesser or equal to the others. These feelings are just at times and > unjust at times. The inferior take to factions for equality, and the equals for greatness over the others. Factions are stirred up for honour and profit, and to avoid dishonour and loss, whether it be for self or for others. >
> Aristotle, Politics

Below, one can see what the causes of factions are, as written in Aristotle's Politics.

Machiavelli explains to us in his work The Prince, that:

> Our ancients, and those who were esteemed wise, used to say that it > was necessary to hold Pistoia with parties and Pisa with fortresses; > and because of this they nourished differences in some towns subject > to them, so as to hold them more easily. In times when Italy was in > balance in a certain mode, holding cities by factions would have been > good to do, but I do not believe that one could give it today as a > teaching. For I do not believe that divisions ever do any good; on the contrary, when the enemy approaches, of necessity divided cities are immediately lost, because the weaker party always joins the external forces and the other will not be able to rule. >
> Machiavelli, The Prince

> Such modes, therefore, imply weakness in the prince. For in a vigorous > principality such divisions are never permitted, because they bring profit only in time of peace, as subjects can be managed more easily through them; but when war comes, such an order shows its own fallaciousness. >
> Machiavelli, The Prince

Though this relates to provinces of principalities, it demonstrates to us that factions are pernicious, for they will always pose danger when you are confronted with an enemy.

Han Fei tells us in his work Han Feizi, in the context of King Hsüan of Han, choosing between Kung Shu and Kung Chung, that:

> "Now suppose Your Majesty employ both of them. Then the more powerful > one will form his own faction inside while the less powerful one will > count on foreign influence. Among the body of officials, if there are > some forming factions inside and thereby acting arrogant towards the sovereign and some others cultivating friendships with foreign states and thereby causing territorial dismemberment, then Your Majesty’s state will be jeopardized" >
> Han Feizi, Collected Persuasions: The Upper Series

Also, in the chapter on pretensions and heresies:

> It was the states to the east of Mount Hua whose officials formed factions, associated for selfish purposes and thereby obscured the right way of government and committed crookedness in secret, and whose territories were dismembered and sovereigns humiliated. >
> Han Feizi, On Pretensions and Heresies

And finally in the chapter on wielding the sceptre:

> "Any ruler wishing to give peace to the state must disperse the partisans of powerful ministers. If he does not disperse their partisans, they will enlarge their parties" >
> Han Feizi, Wielding the Sceptre

Let these be enough as to the nature of what factions may lead us to.

As it is now clear, that factions lead to ruin of sovereignty, let us see what destroys democracies and oligarchies, according to Aristotle:

Of Democracies:

Kautilya counsels in his work Arthaśāstra, Book XI, ways to cause factions in the gaṇarājya-s as well, and his methods in brief consist of incitement over petty things, causing quarrels over the distinction of rank, causing the ceasing of common meals, causing common meals to be taken with those who are not considered to be equals in rank, and in stirring tumults by planting seeds of suspicion about raising inferiors to a higher rank, and generating favour for any prince who was deposed.

Also, he recommends stirring up faction by destroying property of the chiefs by stealth at night to cause quarrels, and favouring the weaker party in such affairs, removing them from the fatherland. He also recommends stealing the property of everyone and giving it to the sovereign magistrate, to cause quarrels.

Apart from these, he exploits the greedy and sexual impulse of the chiefs, who are rich and covetous, by making them compete for affection of a woman, or honey trapping the men in crimes of passion.

In all these things, his goal is to create inequality and suspicion among men, and in splitting such men by favouring the inferiors to separate them from their fellows, he intends the sovereign to enslave such states.

Machiavelli on the lines of what Kautilya advises, says this:

> For the causes of division in a commonwealth are, for the most part, > ease and tranquillity, while the causes of union are fear and war. > Wherefore, had the Veientes been wise, the more divided they saw Rome > to be, the more should they have sought to avoid war with her, and > endeavoured to gain an advantage over her by peaceful arts. And the > best way to effect this in a divided city lies in gaining the > confidence of both factions, and in mediating between them as arbiter > so long as they do not come to blows; but when they resort to open > violence, then to render some tardy aid to the weaker side, so as to > plunge them deeper in hostilities, wherein both may exhaust their > forces without being led by your putting forth an excess of strength to suspect you of a desire to ruin them and remain their master. Where this is well managed, it will almost always happen that you succeed in effecting the object you propose to yourself. >
> Niccolò Machiavelli, Discourses on Livy, Book 2, Chapter 26

Yet, these tactics would fail, if liberty and equality were made cornerstones of constitutional governments and of the gaṇarājya-s as well, and it is seen in the affairs of Rome and Sparta, where as long as factions were kept away by maintaining liberty and equality among men, they could not be destroyed from within, or without.

One sees the failure of seizing a divided city with Rome, when the Veientes attacked her while her inhabitants were disunited, but it resulted in a contrary outcome for the Veientes.

Machiavelli again tells us in his discourses that:

> Thus this conclusion may be drawn from this discourse: that he who > wishes to make a republic where there are very many gentlemen cannot > do it unless he first eliminates all of them; and that he who is where > there is very much equality and wishes to make a kingdom or a > principality will never be able to make it unless he draws from that > equality many of ambitious and unquiet spirit and makes them gentlemen > in fact, and not in name, granting them castles and possessions and > giving them favor in belongings and men. So placed in the midst of them, through them he maintains his power, and they, through him, maintain their ambition. The others are constrained to endure the yoke that force, and never anything else, can make them endure. >
> Niccolò Machiavelli, Discourses on Livy, Book 1, Chapter 55

Who these gentlemen are, is said in the same chapter:

> Those republics in which a political and uncorrupt way of life is > maintained do not endure that any citizen of them either be or live in > the usage of a gentleman; indeed, they maintain among themselves an > even equality, and to the lords and gentlemen who are in that province they are very hostile. If by chance some fall into their hands, they kill them as the beginnings of corruption and the cause of every scandal. >
> To clarify this name of gentlemen such as it may be, I say that those > are called gentlemen who live idly in abundance from the returns of > their possessions without having any care either for cultivation or > for other necessary trouble in living. Such as these are pernicious in every republic and in every province, but more pernicious are those who, beyond the aforesaid fortunes, command from a castle and have subjects who obey them. >
> -Niccolo Machiavelli, Discourses on Livy, Book 1, Chapter 55

And from this, we draw the conclusion, that the great indeed stir up faction more than the masses, for as we have seen it in part 1, that so great is the ambition of the great, that it soon brings to ruin a city if it is not beaten down by various ways and modes.

This is further corroborated by Aristotle, who says that :

> Democracy is safer and less liable to faction than Oligarchy. In > oligarchies, two factions arise, one between the oligarchs and the people, and one of the oligarchs among themselves. In democracies, on the other hand, the only faction that arises is against oligarchy; internal faction within a democracy virtually never occurs. >
> Aristotle, Politics, Book V

But the terms of liberty and equality, which bring with them vice today, may be distasteful to the virtuous man, yet, such liberty and equality must be pursued, which keeps constitutions safe and sound, since history tells us that with liberty and equality, Rome maintained her Republic until Caesar, and so did Athens, after multiple struggles against tyrants and oligarchs until the Macedonians subdued her, and Sparta until the Romans absorbed her.

Such liberty and equality, which keeps factions away, and has been briefly explained in part 1, shall be treated in the third part at length, when we talk about preservation of constitutions.

In our times, and in our fatherland, we see the causes of factions as not having been extinguished, but this may ring true for all of the world indeed. Why such factions are maintained today, we do not know, and who brings them to split apart fellow men, to render them strangers and enemies in the same land, to mix incompatible multitudes, and use all types of intrigue hidden from our eyes to make us servile, we do not know, but that it happens, is a cause for alarm, to every man who wishes to preserve his liberty.

The question is to us then: Do we the people wish to live divided until we cease to be in associations, or do we wish to live with our fellows, and not as lords and slaves, or kings and subjects, but as friends and relatives, as equals?
