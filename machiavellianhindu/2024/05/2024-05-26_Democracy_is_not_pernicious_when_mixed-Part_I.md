That the name of the popular form of government causes revulsion and contempt is well known in the world, from the times of the ancients and until our times as well. No less is this contempt in modern India, as is seen, from the lowest rungs to the great thinkers.

Some condemn it for being too inclusive, and others for being too ignoble, and some others for being against their mode of life. Regardless, it merits not many calumnies, which are made with ill consideration and without examining the true nature of such a government, since times have rendered the opinion of some as the sole authority, and have wrongly attributed to the multitude, what is best attributed to the great in states, and also, what goes by the name of democracy is a caricature, which is not even a democracy in substance. Nevertheless, we shall consider the modes of the ancients, and will see how a free people in a republic has gained as much glory, if not more, than a people under a prince.

Now of the governments it is said that there are six forms, by some. Three are good, and their counterparts, similar to them, are bad.

The three good are called the kingship, the aristocratic and the popular government, and their corrupted counterparts are tyranny, oligarchy and democracy respectively. The three corrupted forms are so, because the sovereign in it rules for personal benefit, and the three good forms are so, because the sovereign rules for the common good.

Now Cicero holds the monarchic government to deprive the people of the powers of jurisdiction and counsel, while the aristocratic deprives them of liberty and power as well as share in public deliberation, and the democratic leads to a culpable equalling which destroys distinction of rank, and brings down the great to an undignified position, despite all of them being well ordered.

Aristotle holds that inequality in one thing should not imply inequality in all things, and equality in one thing should not imply equality in all things. Where either of these happen, we get a deviated constitution, which is democracy, tyranny or oligarchy.

Here, democracy is based on the premise that equality in one domain implies equality in all domains, and it rises from this notion, and in the same way, the notion of inequality in one domain implying inequality in all domains gives rise to oligarchy, or tyranny.

One sees that Athens gained its glory under the democratic rule of Pericles and others, who made it the foremost among cultural powers of Attica, and not under the kings, while Rome made itself the master of the Mediterranean sea when it became a Republic, and subsequently, this laid the foundation for pax Romana.

Now this being understood, we will consider some criticisms of democracy from the viewpoint of the Indians, which are by no means exhaustive, and more may be made and refuted as they arise.

The first relates to chaos and prolixity in the process of deliberation. Another relates to the hereditary nature of kings and its place in the system, a third related to the temperament of the franchise holding citizens, a fourth to the gullibility of the people,

And finally, about the dedication of the magistrates of a popular government, and the questions of liberty and equality in a democracy, without which, a democracy can never take hold.

I will assume that the Indian populace could hypothetically rule itself, and would not be given to relinquishing its part in the state.

Of democracies, the features are eleven, according to Aristotle:

1\. Election to magistracies by all from among all.

2\. Rule of all over each man and each man over all by turns.

3\. Magistracies filled by lot, either all, or at least those which do not call for experience or skill.

4\. No tenure of office is dependant on property qualification, or if at all, it is nominal.

5\. The same man does not hold a magistracy twice, or more than a few times, and only a few are allowed to be held multiple times except for military offices.

6\. A short tenure for magistracies, all or as many as possible.

7\. All citizens sit on juries, chosen from all citizens and adjudicating on all matters or most, like constitutional matters, audits, contracts etc.

8\. Assembly is sovereign authority in everything, or at least the most important matters, magistrates have no sovereign power over anyone, or as few people as possible, or a council/senate should be sovereign over important matters. (The council is democratic as long as the members do not get paid lavishly, since lavish pay makes the people take powers in their own hands and it destroys power of the council.)

9.Payment for services in assembly, courts and magistracies is regular for all, or at any rate in courts, magistracies, senate, assembly meetings which are sovereign, and those offices where common meals are mandatory.

10\. Since high birth, great wealth, and good education are marks of an oligarchy, low birth, low wealth and mechanical occupations are typical marks of a democracy.

11\. No office has perpetual tenure, and if one such is left over from a previous one after a revolution, its powers are reduced and election to it is done by lot.

Now each criticism made, especially in the Indian context, shall be considered, keeping in mind these principles.

**Dedication of magistrates to work**

Now some argue that the king has a better dedication than the head office in a constitutional government. This means that the kingly office being a life office, he is bound to his duties in a way that the head office is not, since the latter is time limited.

This also implies that offices with a time limit have less of a long term thinking, and more of a short term thinking, while life offices can incorporate both.

Also, the king being supreme, would have direct discretion over every department in the kingdom, but a supreme magistrate would only be accountable to where his direct dominion lies, and not to other domains, where the magistrates for that domain would be supreme.

To this, I will say that it is a difference of nature of both governments, and it is a function of law and custom which decides how dedicated a magistrate or a king will be.

The kingly government is premised on the fact that a king is supreme in virtue to all the other men, taken individually or together, in a state. But in a democracy, one bounded by laws, and called a polity, the mass of free men living in a state are together virtuous, though they may lack individually in absolute virtue.

Now this implies that one may get at times, in a democratic form, a leader lacking in virtue, and such may end up leading the state to ruin.

But this is predicated on the premise that a man's magisterial position is in flux, and the king's position is stable, with no threats to the latter, except for exile after usurping of the throne, and of death, while the former has a shorter duration of office, and he may be outed by another in elections, and is not guaranteed to stay in his position, and thus, has less incentive to act.

To this, it may be said that no two magistracies in democracy are the same, and higher magistracies are given to virtuous and more spirited people, while the lower ones are given to all by lot, as we have seen above. Given that the highest magistracy would have to be very high in virtue, a virtuous man may not need to worry about losing his position, and since the task of this magistracy would be one with high stakes, there is no need to doubt that this man would perform just as better, if not more, than a king would, in as far as their common domain is concerned.

Of the other magistracies, we see even in kingly governments that other domains are delegated to the notables for administration, as we have seen in Arthaśāstra and also in many more monarchic states. These magistracies are also not always life offices, and the king has full power over them, to move men as he pleases in many countries, and especially of the Turks in an older time.

Now if one considers rightly the nature of magistracies among the Greeks, the lot distributed magistracies or vote distributed magistracies in a democracy are always better than those given by a king, since regular audits of the magistrates, with impeachment provisions keep them focused on the task, since a magistracy is a source of great honour. But in a kingly form, the magistracy depends on the king, and if one can corrupt the monarch or gain leverage over him, he may be able to retain power as a magistrate, but in democracies, he needs to corrupt a larger body, and in this process, he is not always going to be successful, for a people who hold their liberty dear, will never let him corrupt them with allurements and sophistries designed to deceive.

Again, if we consider the nature of men, they are wont to remain in one mode, and do not change their ways according to the circumstances, as Machiavelli demonstrates. Such a flexibility of modes in a kingdom is hard to find, if we presuppose full sovereignty of the king, while in a popular government, mixed or pure, you will find many kinds of men, who will be able to handle more situations.

And if it be said that a magistrate, lacking in some virtue, would fail to counter a situation, it may be said that every state needs a provision, where the normal modes may not be enough to deal with a situation, in the form of an extremely powerful office, which nevertheless does not usurp sovereignty of the commonwealth.

Such a provision was made with the dictatorial office in the Roman Republic, which was employed many times in the middle and early republic, when the modes available to the Romans were not enough. It was a mode with the absolute powers of a king, but only for a specific task, and once the task was over, this office was relinquished, and not used for ulterior motives, until the late republic, when men like Sulla and Caesar became dictators and the latter a dictator for life, which led to the doom of the Republic.

Summing this up, it may be said that due to extreme flexibility that a popularly ordered government, mixed or pure has, magistracies can have a wider range of powers, and can accomodate many temperaments which taken together, help a constitution to survive longer, than a monarchy can.

**Too many rulers**

The second consideration shall be of the notion that in the popular government, there are too many people taking care of the state's business, and that it may be better to leave it in the hands of a few, as opposed to letting the hoi polloi run things.

On this, the opinion of Machiavelli is pertinent:

> So great is the ambition of the great that it soon brings to ruin a > city, if it is not beaten down by various ways and modes. >
> -Niccolò Machiavelli, Discourses on Livy

Now considering this point, we may say that a populace which abandons its direct involvement in the matters of the state, will soon be enslaved by those who involve themselves in the state.

This is seen in our times, everywhere, the fact that people with money are able to influence the government's policies more than the middle class and the poor, in politically ordered states, and there is no mechanism, whether by custom or by ostracism, to check the influence of the rich, on the governments of our times, and have such a mechanism operated by the citizens.

One may also say that factions in a constitution resulting from a great multitude being sovereign, make it susceptible to subversion, and on this, I shall speak at length in the second part.

For now, as said above, having many virtuous men allows a constitution to navigate a wider range of problems than a kingly form can, since men do not change their ways of living due to prudence, but only out of necessity, and men, if they want good fortune always, must change their mode with the times. Only in a popular government, mixed or pure, can this mechanism be realised, and not elsewhere.

**Temperament of the citizens:**

Now Aristotle explicitly states that citizens are all armed men in popular governments, and this is also affirmed by Machiavelli, for he calls republics as heavily armed.

In the Indian society, it is said by some that only Kṣatriya-s are mandated to keep arms, and not everyone else, from among the fourfold system of Varṇa-s

Now such a critique might imply that Kṣatriya-s alone may hold citizenship in a democracy, and that any other Varṇa-s may not participate in government, due to the inherent nature of the other Varṇa-s to not have any martial temperament.

Now to consider temperament, one may say that the ruler's temperament lacks in most of the others, and for this, it may not be wise to give any part to the populace in government.

To this, we have words of Mahabharata which detail that the king's privy council has to be from all sections of the four Varṇa-s, and Kauṭilya, who does not discriminate either on the basis of any citizen's Varṇa for their qualification as a magistrate, but qualifies them as being men of virtuous character , family and having knowledge theoretical and practical, over all else, and this is enough to tell us that having a part in government for the populace has little to do with Varṇa, and everything to do with character in the political thought of Indians.

And lest someone say that martial temperaments are not to be found except in a few people, may these words of Machiavelli be enough:

> Nature creates few men brave, industry and training makes many. > Discipline in war counts more than fury. >
> -Niccolò Machiavelli, the Art of War

From this, one can see that education in war is all that counts, and it is enough to create men who will defend the fatherland.

**Ritual eligibility of the ruler**

In our religion, certain rites are considered exclusive to certain sections, and this extends to kings as well. Given that certain ceremonies and sacrifices are exclusive to kings, and if you were to include one not from the Kṣatriya-s as an Archon, he may not perform such rites.

To this, we will point to ancient examples, of Rome and Athens. In the former, we see that a new post was created, of the Rex Sacrorum, who performed the rites which were once the purview of the Roman king along with his wife the Regina Sacrorum, and this office had no political powers.

Athens on the other hand, had the king Archon's office, where he had little of political power, and was instead the supreme authority in religious dispute resolutions and also of resolution of the cases of murder, of the Athenians , and also was the supervisor of hereditary sacrifices and the Eleusinian mysteries, with the Ceryces and the Eumolpidae families. Also, a Dionysian rite was performed by his wife at the Boukolion, where she weds Dionysus ritually.

In Sparta which was a mix of democratic, oligarchic and monarchic modes, we see hereditary heralds of which Herodotus talks about in his histories.

From this, we can see a general principle: Since every popularly ordered government originated as a kingship, when the king's authority is transferred to the freeborn members of the commonwealth, the kingly office becomes a priesthood, and optionally, a very degenerated magistracy. Such offices are never given full executive power, and are kept away from it largely, and their domain is left to be purely religion, and in some cases, jurisdiction, which is also of the same domain. In our case, one may keep the priesthood without any executive power, and only have it retain its powers in matters of religion.

In such a way, one can allow some majesty of the old kings to stay, while also allowing the others to serve in office.

**On the Hereditary nature of the kings, and the popular government**

Now from the philosophy of Aristotle, we understand one thing:

Oligarchies form because inequality is assumed to be absolute when it is found in one thing among men, and democracies form when equality is assumed to be absolute when found in one thing.

Also, Aristotle explains why monarchies were the earliest government. It was because men who were capable of ruling were never very many or even few, and one man had to be excessive in virtue to even establish a polis.

Then, the κύκλος happens, which is a process where governments change form, and rulers become greater or fewer in number, depending on circumstances. This is said to happen because virtue in general is manifest in one man first, then in a few together and finally in many together, and due to descent into licence of the ruling entity.

He explains the preponderance of monarchies in India, based on Scylax who was the source of Herodotus on India, as being due to the abundance of virtue of the kings compared to the rest of the people.

Now if we consider the opinion on equality and this of ruler's virtue, we draw this conclusion:

If the king has a very great virtue over the rest of the populace, then the king deserves to rule over everyone, but if the king's virtue is not excessive over his subjects, and if every free man, or every one from the notables taken individually, has equal virtue to him, then he deserves to share in power, else, it would be considered a tyranny, since to rule over superiors is unjust and inappropriate, while to rule over inferiors and to share power with equals is appropriate and just.

One can further demonstrate this with an example: Let us take two freelance programmers, one belongs to the same community as that of the client, while the other is not from the same. Both these programmers are equally skilled, with the same education, same alma mater and same performance in their computer science program. They charge similar prices as well, and the difference between their charges is not significant. Who should get the contract?

In this matter, the one with better execution would get the contract, and this may be inferred from the proposals of the two.

If we further refine this example, let us say that they are both trustworthy, and have the same rating of trustworthiness from their past projects, with no significant differences in this. And let us even say that the one from the client's is extremely talented in sports and classical languages, winning competitions and being popular in these domains, while the other has nothing significant to say about his interests outside of work. Yet, the contract goes to the best executor, not necessarily to the polymath, since sports and classical languages have no bearing on his ability to code, which requires one to be well versed in computer languages and things related to such.

From this, it may be inferred that birth etc, which have only an approximate relation, are not as important as virtue is, in running a magistracy or a government by an individual.

And finally, from Aristotle, we understand another thing:

> "Kingships no longer arise today, but when they do, they are tyrannies > or master rule. This is because kingship is rule by consent as well as > sovereignty over more important affairs. But no one is so outstanding > as to fit the grandeur and greatness of kingship, and people of equal > quality are numerous. For this reason men do not consent to being > ruled under the kingly name, and if someone ends up acquiring kingly > power by force or fraud, it is regarded as a tyranny. Another cause of > downfall concerns hereditary monarchies: Those who inherit it are > often despicable, and though they possess kingly power, not tyrannical > power, they end up ill treating others. The overthrow of kingship then > is easy. When people no longer wish to him to be king, he is no more > one, but a tyrant remains a tyrant even though people do not want him. > For these reasons and others like them, monarchies suffer destruction. >
> Aristotle's Politics, Book V, chapter X

If someone may still say that a king has more wisdom, let him be shown the example of the Tarquins, who were about to corrupt Rome, with their excesses, and the seizing of Lucretia, until Brutus drove them out, having sworn to no longer have kings in Rome, and of the French who drove out all kingships between the death of Louis XVI and Napoleon III, to finally establish a stable Republic, though the soundness of it may be questionable.

So we draw three things from the above, regarding a popular government:

First, that it is possible to include the hereditary king, but his powers would have to be curtailed and restricted to the religious sphere, while executive power would have to rotate between magistrates who are elected by vote, or lot, if they are equal in ruling virtue to the individual who is king. Second, that the king may continue to be hereditary and for life in that case, since religion is something which does not vary as much as rulers do, and it is enough to maintain it as it is passed down, with no need for much alteration, except when extraordinary circumstances arise.

Also, it is not wise to assume that a king is necessarily wise, since corrupting a man is easier than corrupting a multitude, and for this reason, rule being given to a few or one is always with danger, but the least danger is there in giving rule to many, since the many are harder to corrupt, and they can maintain their liberty and mode of life far longer.

But finally, we come to the questions of liberty and equality, for every ancient has said that a democracy has both. Today, these terms too carry a negative meaning to some, due to the behaviour of those who were once considered respectable, yet neither of these warrant censure attached to them.

**Liberty and equality, necessary evils?**

In general, liberty did not mean what it means to us in the present. Liberty is something which is guaranteed to the free man in a democracy, along with equality, and there is no way a democracy can function or exist without these two.

In brief, I will say this is what liberty and equality are, in a democracy:

Liberty, is maintained by laws, and if you want liberty, you have to be a slave to the laws, so says Cicero, and neither be a slave to any man nor be despot over others, says Demosthenes in his fourth Philippic

If you want equality, you can not rule others despotically, but only as a statesman, and you must let all members of the commonwealth take part in the government by turns, as says Aristotle in his Politics.

In liberty, one lives as he likes, which means that he is not compelled or impeded in his course of actions, so says Epictetus. This distinguishes it from license, for there is compulsion in it, and from slavery, where compulsion and impedance both are seen, and license eventually leads to mātsyanyāya, which is the state where the strong will devour the weak. In liberty, one will never accept slavery to any man or nation, and will rather die than being subject to such. In equality, all men, based on one thing, share in government, and in a democracy, such equality is based on free birth as a member of the commonwealth.

And as Aristotle tells us, despotic rule of the older kind remains no longer with us, due to the king being no longer supreme in virtue over all other men, but due to education, he is no longer preeminent in most matters, and if someone ends up taking kingly power, he is not a benefactor, but a tyrant.

But as seen in Aristotle's and Cicero's works, democracy is not without its shortcomings, and for this, both of them, along with Polybius and Machiavelli, advocate mixing it with the virtuous and the rich men, as well as kingly power, to be able to manage it better.

In part II, I will demonstrate how this soundness of a popular government may be maintained by mixing, taking the opinion of Greeks and Romans, and considering the criticisms made by them as stated in the beginning here, but also drawing from the Indian sources of local self government that are known to us.

But now the question is to us Hindus, do we really want to be ruled by enlightened despots, or will we be able to sublimate this ancient form of liberty and equality in our paradigm of which the former was made a Goddess by the Greeks and Romans, and make ourselves great in the world!
