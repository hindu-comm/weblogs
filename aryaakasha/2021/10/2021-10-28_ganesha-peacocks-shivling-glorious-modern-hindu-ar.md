Ganesha, Peacocks, & Shivling – Glorious Modern Hindu Art

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/img_20210315_231352_0-1.jpg?w=800)

Lord Ganesha , Lord of Obstacles ( Vinayaka ) and Remover of Obstacles ( Vighnahara ) , depicted in front of a ShivLing (an aniconic – other than the crescent Moon sliver – representation of His Father) , and peacocks – a bird with which He has association.

ॐ गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम् । ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः शृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम् ॥

Now, I have chosen that particular verse quite deliberately – for it is the most famous Ganesha homage … and in its original RigVedic context, RV II 23 1-2, it exists as a Brihaspati hailing.

Brihaspati, as we have already demonstrated, is a form correlate with Rudra – Rudra being the Father of Lord Ganesha, it is therefore most eminently a case of “Like Father Like Son” !

Hence, with the Moon-Crowned ShivLing in the central midground of the image, it seemed only apt to have such a ‘dual-purpose’ liturgy to be made use of here.

For more upon this particular invocation, I wrote about this earlier – <https://aryaakasha.com/2019/09/03/aum-gananam-tva-ganapatim/>
