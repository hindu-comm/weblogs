The Hanuman Of My Home Shrine

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_30921.jpg?w=768)

It is Tuesday – Hanuman’s Day. And therefore …

This is the Hanuman of my Household Shrine. And as you’ll immediately
note, it’s a bit of a different style to the other deific
representations. Both because of its style, as well as its form.

For you see – it is a Balinese shadow-puppet. One that has been in our
household for .. well .. longer than I’ve been alive. Brought from Bali
by my parents quite some time ago.

Various previous pictures of my main home-shrine have showcased the
beautiful Durga Murti that my older sister gave to me, and the excellent
Nataraja Murti that my younger sister provided.

Now, for six and a half years Lord Hanuman has been strongly important
for my regular practice – and yet, for a long time I did not have a
Bajrangi Murti in my home-shrine.

This had not mattered so much when I was still able to be at Mandir
twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays – for Hanuman & Devi respectively) …
but since moving to the utilization of the household shrine instead –
well, it became a necessity to do something about.

While this is probably not a permanent solution (as I’m rather concerned
about close proximity to various of the things involved in a customary
puja for this quite venerable and delicate figure), it still feels
rather warmly appropriate in some ways – the Hanuman that has been here
the whole time, even decades before we knew Who Hanuman Is … becoming an
active part of the contemporary devotions that we are carrying out here
and now in His (And Rama’s) Name.

Bajrang Bali Ki Jaye !
