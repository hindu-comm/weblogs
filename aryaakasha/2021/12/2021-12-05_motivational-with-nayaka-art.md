Motivational with Nayaka art

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/arya-akasha-endeavour.png?w=1024)

“Though silver in your palms weighs light  
Compared to death by blast and sword,  
Do not shy the hopeless fight,  
For Endeavour is its own reward.”  
  
The evocative fresco painting comes from the Brihadisvara Temple complex
in South India – a Chola site that had been renovated under the (iirc
Telugu) Nayaka rulers in the 16th-17th century.
