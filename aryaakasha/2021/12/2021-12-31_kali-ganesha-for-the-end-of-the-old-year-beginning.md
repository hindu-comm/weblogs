Kali & Ganesha For The End Of The Old Year & Beginning Of The New

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/6ab3f1e0aa8502f42b5adaf6b0545f97.jpg?w=564)

As we creep inexorably forward toward the End of 2021 and the Beginning of 2022, this image seemed apt to post.

Why? Because here we have Kali – Goddess of Time, and also of Endings ; and Her Son Ganesha – a God of Openings, and One Who is prayed to at Beginnings.

Perhaps entirely uncoincidentally – Two Deities Who have had … a pervasive saliency with our operations and existence of late.

Jai Mata Di !

And Hail also to Vinayaka !

May They Both Guide and Empower our efforts in the actions to come !
