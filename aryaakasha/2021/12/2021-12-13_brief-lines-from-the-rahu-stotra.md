Brief lines from the Rahu Stotra

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/265750676_10165843534635574_8538912900189476736_n.jpg?w=576)

Since it is Shaani’s Hora \[Saturn’s Hour\] on a Monday \[Moon’s Day – Lord Shiva’s Day\] – and something Lunar resonant has been reminded of … it seemed appropriate to post this.

Rahur dhanavamanthri cha simhika chitha nandana, Ardha kaya, sada krodhi, chandradhithya vimardhana

Rahu, Vizier of Danavas and Delighter of Simhika \[His Mother\] Half-Bodied, Ever Wrathful, Moon and Sun Trampling / Eclipsing

Roudhro rudhra priyo daithya swar bhanur, bhanur bheethidha, Graha raja sudhapayee rakadhithyabhilashtaka

Terrifying, Devotee of Rudra, Daitya, Svarbhanu \[‘Censurer of the Sun’\], Radiance Imperiler Lord of Influencers \[‘Grahas’\], Who Received Amrit, Moon and Sun Desirer

These are the first two verses of the Rahu Stotra from the Skanda Purana – which I felt like taking a shot at translating. I may return to this, as well as provide additional annotation in future.
