Bhairava & Kali For The Transition Of The Cycle Of Time On New Year’s Eve / Day

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/tumblr_m2rz01jzu11runtg8o2_1280.jpg?w=675)

There are few situations which cannot be matched with a fine exemplar of the artwork of Abhishek Singh. In this case, he had chosen to depict Bhairava & Kali at the end of a Kalpa (‘Cycle of Time’).

He later refined the Bhairava into a full-colour work; yet I think that there is something immensely powerful about this wash-study – perhaps because there is so much which we can see precisely because it’s only half-there.

The Kali kneeling before Bhairava is exquisite. The shapes to the bottom and left of the image, seem to recall in some cases the Ganas of Rudra – or perhaps all the ink-blotches are intended as Smoke, Embers, Fires at the End of Creation .

A fitting piece for a New Year’s Eve / Morn posting. It, after all, has both Time and the incipient sense of the transition from one previous period on into a new cycle. With all of the blood and fire which that might customarily entail.

We Hail both Ishvara & Ishvari , Rudra & Rudrani , MahaKaal & Great Kali – The Lord & Lady of Time !
