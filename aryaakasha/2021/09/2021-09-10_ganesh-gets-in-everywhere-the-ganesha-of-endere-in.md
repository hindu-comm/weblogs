Ganesh Gets In Everywhere – The Ganesha Of Endere In The Taklamakan For Ganesh Chaturthi

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/241417691_10165558847255574_7960867775879169347_n.jpg?w=767)

Tonight marks the first night of Ganesh Chaturthi – and so therefore,
some rather amazing art one and a half millennia ancient from the
Khotanese Saka ( Scythian ) settlement of Endere, in the Taklamakan
Desert of Western China.

Why? Well, partially it is because this piece has been on my mind
recently and I had cause to use it this very morning to counter somebody
who was attempting to suggest I was basically imagining/fabricating the
idea of Hindu influence out there.

But largely because this image stands for another essential truth.

He really does Get In Everywhere.

This is partially why the Vahana (‘vehicle’ / ‘steed’) of Ganesha is so
often depicted as a Mouse – because a Mouse, too, can seemingly get in
anywhere.

Quite a thing in some ways. You go digging in a desert in China – there
He is.

Over the ensuing Ten Night, I’ll have a few other – perhaps surprising –
occurrences for Ganesha in some pretty interesting places !
