Ganesha Atop The Volcano Of Brahma in Indonesia [Incredible Indo-European Holy Sites Series Part VI]

For the Sixth Night of Ganesh Chaturthi – the theme of our devotional
efforts on each of these nights has been that Ganesha Gets In
Everywhere. So here’s Ganesh, atop an active volcano in Indonesia where
it has been and been in constant use for the past 700 years.

The volcano in question is entitled Mt Bromo – which is interesting,
because this is the loka-lized pronunciation for “Brahma”, a name of
obvious Hindu connotation. Even despite Indonesia today being the
world’s largest Muslim population – it has never lost its Hinduness,
preserved not only upon Bali but also in other communities such as this.
Indeed, further demonstrating just how far Ganesha Gets In Everywhere –
He even features upon their banknotes.

Now, the Ganesha shrine atop Mt Bromo is there for the obvious reason –
protection of the Tenggerese (the people of the area) from the volcano.
However, Mt Bromo also forms a focal-point for the Yadnya Kasada
observance … which I should, perhaps, return to write upon at some other
time.

For now – it is enough to marvel at the ongoing saliency and active
worship of Ganesha there, even amidst what might overtly appear to be
rather inhospitable environs !
