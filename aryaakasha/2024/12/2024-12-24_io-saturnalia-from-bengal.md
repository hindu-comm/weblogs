Io Saturnalia From Bengal

I was very pleased to receive the following image and brief communique from one of our Brahminical cadre in India:  
  
“Greetings for Saturnalia folks  
Performed a very simplistic Saturnalia offering  
Why ? Because we in Arya Akasha know Indo-European as just not a linguistic family but also a cultural family, so we should act as one as well!  
All hails to You, Saturn, eternally!  
For You are Perpetual and Perpetuator.”  
\[-N.M.\]  
  
Io, Saturnalia !  
We do, indeed, remember the Reason for the Season !  
\[-C.A.R.\]
