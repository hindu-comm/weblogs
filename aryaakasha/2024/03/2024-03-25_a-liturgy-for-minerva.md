A Liturgy for Minerva

The Quinquatria observance had concluded some days ago, however we have yet to present several elements undertaken in relation thereto.

The following is a liturgy for Minerva written by C. Dauphin for the occasion:

“My praise to You, oh Lady of bright,  
from Whom each craft and art derives.  
Here You come, fast-paced to battle,  
adorned by virtues, assembling the awe,  
to spring the grace and might to all.

So I sing and so I praise You!  
Deign to answer my call to arms!

Minerva! First to rise among the Gods,  
You herald Their forces of numinous feats;  
Braced and armed, You vanquish the hordes  
of hellish swarms, and demonic beasts.  
Harbinger of heroes, wonder, and bliss,  
To spearhead the hosts against the blight,  
Oh Dragoness Goddess, of heavenly hiss,  
You bear the flags of Olympian might.  
Sunlike Commander, Who blazes the trail,  
The sunlight wielding as blade and pike,  
forth bring victory to mankind’s avail,  
countering the devils and ghosts alike.

So I sing and so I praise You!  
Deign to answer my call to arms!

Minerva! Mother of feats, treasured skill,  
to Whom poets and sages equally aspire,  
blessed You come, inclined to instill  
the hearts of men to the endless pyre,  
Where shields, spears clash together,  
Beating along Your chant of furors,  
With laurels and lyres to sing forever  
The epic deeds of battle-sung warriors.  
Of those who rest beneath the mounds,  
By forces weaved that none can unravel,  
You unleash their frenzy with Your sounds,  
You raise their spirits back to battle!

So I sing and so I praise You!  
Deign to answer my call to arms!

Minerva! Highest, bravest, defiant!  
The Nine Muses adore You as Their idol.  
Come and listen to Your suppliant  
Who longs and beseeches Your arrival.  
Deign to answer me, oh heavenly Queen,  
Commander of hearts, most gentle spirit!  
Of glories untold, and powers unseen,  
In my soul You abide among the dearest.  
Lady of resolve, hailed be Your Name!  
Rushing for our cause, like a rustled wing,  
May You lit, incite each soul aflame,  
And into our lives renewal the spring.”
