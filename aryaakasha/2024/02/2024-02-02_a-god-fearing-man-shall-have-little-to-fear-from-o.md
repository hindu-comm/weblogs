A God-Fearing Man Shall Have Little To Fear From Other Men

“The More Men Are God-Fearing \[…\] The Less Do They Fear Man.”  
– a slightly figurative rendering of a maxim of Xenophon’s, by J.E. Harrison.

A very cool sentiment, especially in context \[see below where I’ve reproduced the passage in both the original Ancient Greek and two dedicated translations for same\] – wherein I might have carried things a bit further into the realm of the explicit by making the last part “the less do they *have* to fear from man”.

” δεισιδαίμονες ” *does* translate rather directly as ‘Gods-Fearing’ (technically ‘Daimons-Dreading/-Fearing’; with ‘Daimon’ \[ δαίμων \] encompassing ‘God(s)’ within its ambit even in general usage – and context making quite clear that this is the intended understanding herein specifically) …

… however, it should be pointed out that it comes here immediately following Cyrus’ invocation for Zeus under Two Epithets (Zeus ‘Who Fights Alongside One’ \[ σύμμαχος – ‘Summakhos’ \] & Zeus ‘Who Leads’ \[ ἡγεμών – ‘Hegemon’ \] as commencement-signal to his men (this being passed down the line and thence back up to Cyrus as confirmation as to the Advance) …

with Cyrus then initiating the customary Paean \[‘hymn’, ‘war-chant’ to pertinent Divinity\] himself (” ἐξῆρχεν αὐτὸς ὁ Κῦρος παιᾶνα τὸν νομιζόμενον ” ) and being swiftly joined in full-throated chorus by his “God(s)-Revering” \[ θεοσεβῶς – Theosebes\] host of men in this performance.

So – per my figurative and inferential extension as to things …

“The More Men Are God(s)-Fearing \[and actively undertaking of the proper pious actions to vehemently express same\] The Less Do They \[have to\] Fear \[from\] Man.”

“While they were still out of range, Cyrus sent the watchword along the lines, “Zeus our help and Zeus our leader.” And as soon as it was returned to him, he sounded the first notes of the battle-paean, and the men took up the hymn devoutly, in one mighty chorus. For at such times those who fear the gods have less fear of their fellow-men.”  
\[Dakyns translation\]

“While they were still out of range, Cyrus passed the watchword, Zeus our Helper and our Guide. And when the watchword came back and was delivered again to him, Cyrus himself began the usual paean, and they all devoutly joined with a loud voice in the singing, for in the performance of such service the God-fearing have less fear of men.”  
\[Miller translation\]

“ἕως δ᾽ ἔτι ἔξω βελῶν ἦσαν, παρηγγύα ὁ Κῦρος σύνθημα Ζεὺς σύμμαχος καὶ ἡγεμών. ἐπεὶ δὲ πάλιν ἧκε τὸ σύνθημα ἀνταποδιδόμενον, ἐξῆρχεν αὐτὸς ὁ Κῦρος παιᾶνα τὸν νομιζόμενον: οἱ δὲ θεοσεβῶς πάντες συνεπήχησαν μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ: ἐν τῷ τοιούτῳ γὰρ δὴ οἱ δεισιδαίμονες ἧττον τοὺς ἀνθρώπους φοβοῦνται.”  
Xenophon, Cyropaedia III 3 58
