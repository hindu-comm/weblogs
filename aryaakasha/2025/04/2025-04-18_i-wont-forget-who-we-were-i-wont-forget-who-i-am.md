“I won’t forget who we were, I won’t forget who I am”

![](https://aryaakasha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/492410943_122130011438753835_9103642978771852061_n.jpg?w=681)

An associate had posted this the other day, and it resonates with the … curious objection recorded to the English Heritage charity’s publicizing of Easter’s roots with an Anglo-Saxon deific and observance.

To quote from the Daily Mail piece [I’d referenced with this morning’s (brief) writeup](https://aryaakasha.com/2025/04/17/english-heritage-actually-acknowledging-english-heritage-for-easter-apparently-creates-outrage/), you had a Conservative Party councilor saying the following:

“English Heritage’s Origins of Easter poster is pathetic – erasing our Judeo-Christian roots in favour of an obscure eighth century god.

Roman records confirm Christ’s crucifixion at Passover long before any Anglo-Saxon celebrated Jesus’ Resurrection or ‘danced around bonfires’.”

It is, I would say, somebody who is in denial of their ‘roots’ – and would dearly like to believe, on some deep and intrinsic level that they have a much more direct and civilizational connection to those “Judeo-Christian” occurrences featuring “Passover”, and ‘confirmed’ via “Roman records” detailing events in the Middle East.

And, you know? They’re allowed to want to believe things.

It’s where they wish to *Deny* things – and want to try and engage in a bit of obliteration (in the sense of forgetting, and militating for others to compulsorily do the same through not coming into contact with the truth in question) … well, that you see is where we are going to be having ourselves a bit of a problem.

A curious thing, indeed, for them to be taking issue with upon this Good *Friday* … as the Rev. Rolinson may have subtly pointed out when I mentioned the apparent ‘controversy’ to him. After all – if you REEE-ally want to engage in ‘Damnatio Memoriae’ for your own actual heritage, then surely one would start with that most ubiquitous of elements … the Days of the Week and how they are named.

But I digress.

When I had seen this image, I had been thinking upon it. It is certainly something worth thinking about.

I have never been under the illusion that, as the comic puts it – one’s ancestors were the saints depicted in stained glass windows, or “desert wanderers or kings of Israel”. And you shall look in vain for a Biblical, Christian name in amidst that most ineluctable trio of “Curwen”, “Ares”, and “Rolinson”.

We *know* the name of our ancestor who is right there in the third one. We know that which it means.

So why the ‘thinking’ ?

Because occasionally, upon occasion, I have encountered persons who have a bit of a ‘difficulty’ with who and what I am in the religious sense.

I am a Hindu – just in case you had somehow missed the memo.

So, how is it that I am in a quite a different boat to the sorts the comic in question raises an eyebrow at?

Well, for one thing, I do not for a moment have some kind of analogy to the “British Israelism” (literal or figurative) sort of thing which the comic crystalizes.

I am very much aware that the “warriors, poets, seers” of Vedic antiquity were the *cousins*, the Great Uncles (and great, they most unquestionably were) of my own forebears of Europe.

I have, therefore, so to speak – ‘moved in’ with the household of my family to the east, due to the lamentable scenario of my *own* more ‘immediate’ IE sphere’s ‘household’ having burned down.

But does this mean that I, too, have forgotten “who I am” ? (excuse the ungrammatical quotation there)

No, because this is, itself, very much part of “who I am”.

And in one of those curious ironies as to the situation – I have wound up very much more ‘in touch’ with who and what my forebears, of the Germanic and other connected IE spheres were, *precisely thanks* to my engagement with that particular IE sphere which is the still-living one even here amidst the modern age.

I am down here upon the other side to the world. From that perspective, perhaps it is a little less ‘illogical’ to head several thousand kilometers in a different direction in order to arrive also at a gleaming vantage-point upon which also to view the now-faded glories of one’s own ‘Ancestral Home’.

And – just as importantly – to continue to help others to find *their* way Home , whether it is (as with myself) of the ‘adoptive’ variety, or the more immediately ‘ancestral’ iteration as with those who take up the mantle proffered via this comic.

It is an ‘Indo-European’ home in either case. With the same Gods – albeit known through different names.

And that – at the center, is most important indeed.

As a wise associate had once framed the mat(t)er to me:

“Come Home, Indo-European Man”
