English Heritage Actually Acknowledging English Heritage For Easter Apparently Creates Outrage

![](https://aryaakasha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/491171888_10171246223175574_3525887181478018933_n.jpg?w=660)

Always interesting what generates the “outrage”. This was [from the Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14606383/English-Heritage-outrage-Easter-not-Christian.html) ; article headline: “English Heritage sparks outrage after telling children Easter was not originally Christian”.

And you know what?

They’re *absolutely correct*.

Here’s Bede upon the subject, writing in the early 700s AD upon then-recently Christianized Anglo-Saxons’ custom, from his ‘Reckoning of Time’ \[De Temporum Ratione, XV\]:

“Eosturmonath has a name which is now translated “Paschal month”, and which was once called after a Goddess of theirs named Eostre, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month.

Now they designate that Paschal season by Her Name, calling the joys of the new rite by the time-honoured name of the old observance.”  
\[Wallis translation\]

—

Now, to be fair – for some the “outrage” component expressed appears to be that there was “no explanation of the Christian element” in the poster. (Notwithstanding that, as the article points out – “English Heritage’s website does refer to the Christian roots of Easter festival, with a page that says it has ‘been the most important date in the religious calendar since the very earliest days of Christianity.'”)

But when I read comments like the following:

“English Heritage’s Origins of Easter poster is pathetic – erasing our Judeo-Christian roots in favour of an obscure eighth century god.

Roman records confirm Christ’s crucifixion at Passover long before any Anglo-Saxon celebrated Jesus’ Resurrection or ‘danced around bonfires’.”

(These words apparently from a Conservative Party councilor)

… well, let me put it this way – I do not think that it is truly the ‘roots’ which are being erased via acknowledging the actual origins both etymological and culturo-religious for the fact we have this particular observance taking place at this particular time and featuring some rather decidedly un-Christian elements involving Eggs and Rabbits and what not.

Quite the contrary.

We can only hope that the Catholic gentleman who included in his statement of complaint that he “had to explain to my 7-year-old son who Eostre was”, was usefully able to avail himself of the resources put forward by English Heritage.

Who, it would appear … have actually been publicizing English Heritage, upon this occasion!

Revolutionary stuff, eh? A pleasant surprise for the season ! New growth all around.
