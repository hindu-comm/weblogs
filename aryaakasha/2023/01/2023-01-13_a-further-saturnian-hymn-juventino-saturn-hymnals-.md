A Further Saturnian Hymn [Juventino Saturn Hymnals I of VII]

As we have said – we intend to present a series of bespoke liturgies for Saturn with a view to rendering justly more prominent within the minds of men His Glory.

And so – this being Saturday, His Day, here is the next in the series (indeed, the first of a set of seven) penned (and then translated into English) by our associate Pereira Juventino \[ Clécio Dauphin \] (as was [the previous installment of these, to be found herein](https://aryaakasha.com/2022/12/31/a-saturn-liturgy-for-saturns-day-and-the-transition-of-the-year-into-renew/); art in both cases by SW).

First Hymn to Saturn

Listen to Us, oh Venerable God  
And Lord of maximum potency!  
Describe Your new kingdom over us,  
Opening the path to heavenly treasures  
And pouring over earth the all-sacred  
lights of yore; the warm expansion  
That reverberates, opening itself  
In waters to every side, and the  
Waters uttering from drop to drop  
That Saturn is truly King.  
That in You there is rest and fortitude,  
And in accurate forms the mortals  
Abound around You, in search for  
Your sacred counsel and the return  
To Ages away from toil and wear,  
Away from hindrance and hardship,  
And from cold and misfortune,  
And from penury and fear.  
Because all things are given  
To us through You, Saturn,  
And nothing is lacking to men or beasts;  
There is neither thirst or sleepiness,  
Nor is shed the blood,  
Nor is spilled the sweat.  
But instead all things remain right  
Under Your ward, fed by  
Your marmoreal warm, and by  
The certainty that the plentiful  
Saturn remains alive among the mortals.  
Listen, oh Sovereign over Sovereigns!  
Do not divert Your eyes or ears from us,  
And do not take Your blessings away;  
But return now, Saturn, and set in  
Those men Your divine spirit.
