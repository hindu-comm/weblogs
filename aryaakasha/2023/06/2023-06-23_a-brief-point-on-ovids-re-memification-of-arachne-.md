A Brief Point On Ovid’s Re-Memification Of Arachne Contra Athena

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/355079161_10167733486080574_9089279194141807156_n.jpg?w=707)

  

occasional reminder that that’s (probably) not how the myth went \[prior to Ovid getting his hands on it and making some ‘alterations’\]

\[you may recall my commentary viz. [what he did to the myth around Artemis and Actaeon](https://aryaakasha.com/2021/11/20/of-artemis-and-actaeon-the-wolf-as-defender-of-the-goddess-a-forensic-theology-examination-of-a-classical-myth-in-the-vedas-and-in-the-stars/) – wherein *we* know, due to various other tellings and the Vedic cognate, that it’s a story about a male attempting to ambush & rape the Goddess … and hence he’s turned into a stag/deer and ripped apart by Wolves / Hunting Dog(s). Ovid, meanwhile, ‘metamorphosized’ \[what I did there, was i misspelled a word\] it into an unlucky mortal just accidentally wandering in the wrong part of the woods and happening to stumble upon Artemis bathing and … then for his trouble being turned into a stag and ripped apart by his own hunting dogs. And making some comment about the morally blameless situation of the human and so forth in the text, iirc … you see how these are … pointedly different takes\]

Anyway, what *appears* to have been the likely archaic and proper understanding for the myth viz. Athena & Arachne … is not that Arachne was transformed into a spider due to doing a better job at weaving than Athena and ‘sore loser’ or whatever.

But rather, due to what Arachne *chose* to weave into her tapestry effort … well, in the original Latin, the succinct descriptor is: “caelestia crimina” – the ‘Crimes of the Gods’.

So, having already insulted Athena (Who’d turned up disguised as an old woman), and *pointedly not gotten the message* even despite being *directly told it* by Her, and then *shown* it through Athena’s choice of subject-matter for *Her* tapestry \[basically, on the one hand, the proper and reciprocal ‘looking after’ of Gods and pious mortals … and Her besting even Poseidon (Who somewhat presumptuously tries claiming He’s actually won, before She’s even made Her move … see the resonance?), through creative ingenuity and boon bestowing to Her People ; and, on the *other* hand , an array of pointed “this is what happens if you want to go with the ‘active disrespect / impiety approach instead …” incidences from the mythos as well … \] ..

I suppose we might say of Arachne that she spun around … and then she found out.

I mean, seriously – Athena produces a tapestry depicting Her beneficence (and … always winning – so as to ensure Her people benefit, likewise from same) alongside a “here’s a bunch of rather negative punishments that can ensue for such conduct … featuring forcible shape-changing … “

… and Arachne’s response to this is to, as I say, weave a series of calculated insults – as if *daring* the Divine to ‘live up’ to the warning-signs.

Ovid, of course, makes the figures woven by Athena as ‘examples’ guilty of rather particular sorts of ‘compared self to divinity, found to be insulting, soo …’ – however it’s interesting to observe that in various cases, other renditions of those relevant myths have the mortals in question having broader crimes of impiety \[Cinyras, for instance, winds up with descriptions of oathbreaking and fraudulent deception of an ally, being party to incest , and some other things\] to their names.

So, Arachne engaged in a rather incredibly foolhardy ‘defamation’ exercise \[speculated to perhaps have been Ovid having a bit of a whinge about artistic censorship under the then-Roman government , which had wound up with his being sent into exile … \], and got the *not* inevitable result.

Not inevitable, I say, because Athena gave her *several* chances / warnings etc. to change course, but .. well .. yee.

As it turned out – Arachne could, indeed, weave a mighty fine tapestry.

But the Tapestry of Fate … that is not her handiwork.

And Athena weaves *Reality* \[there’s a ‘Maya’ remark here also – viz. .. ‘veil’ and ‘magical potency’\].

There was always only going to be one (righteous) winner.
