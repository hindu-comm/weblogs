It’s currently Sharada NavRatri for we Hindus (the Nine Nights of the Goddess Durga , Chandika / Chamunda ) – and so therefore, a look at the observance in light of its Indo-European context.

This includes the correlate Goddess-oriented War Rites undertaken by both the Romans (in the form of [the Quinquatria dedicated to Minerva](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/03/27/on-the-equinox-war-rites-of-the-indo-europeans/) ) and the focal for the Hrēþ mōnaþ (Month of Hretha ) of the Germanic Anglo-Saxons (which points toward the Goddess Rheda ).

We also engage Vedic attestations for both Warfare and Goddess (of Death) observances which are pertinent, and the [mythic deed](https://aryaakasha.com/2022/10/05/a-combat-of-piety-lord-ramas-averted-eye-sacrifice-to-devi-for-victory-and-its-vedic-antecedents/) of [Lord Rama](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/04/14/ramas-invocation-of-the-war-goddess/) which incepted the Autumnal propitiation for the Goddess (in parallel to the Spring observance) for Victory in War.

Both of these strands – the War Rites (initially more of Spring) and [the Goddess-keyed observances of Seasonal Transition between Light and Dark halves to the Year](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/05/04/a-slightly-belated-beltane-commentary-with-additional-slavic-comparanda/) – have underpinned our modern Chaitra & Sharada Navratri understandings.

And the strong concordancy between these perceptions as found in both the Indo-European West (i.e. Europe) and East (i.e. the Hindusphere) help to further demonstrate that these Goddess-oriented elements are, indeed, endogenously and archaically Indo-European.

Jai Mata Di !
