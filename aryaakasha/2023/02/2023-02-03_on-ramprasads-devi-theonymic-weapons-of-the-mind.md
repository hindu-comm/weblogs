On Ramprasad’s Devi Theonymic Weapons Of The Mind

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/327857101_689467972973384_4029645696353378880_n.jpg?w=651)

An associate had sent me this poem – curiously, as fate would have it, very swiftly after I’d finished my Kali & Durga hymnals in the pre-dawn darkness here after yet another night awake.

It is an interesting suite of verses. And no doubt, would be more so if I were working from the Bengali original with its suite of Sanskrit-origin terminology to pick over to more precisely uncover the poet’s potential intent of meaning.

But we shall make do.

That notion of the Mind “hold\[ing\] the Sword of Kali’s Name” – attains an additional depth when one considers that this is evidently being wielded against ‘Time’ and ‘Death’ \[‘Kaal’\] ; and there is a pleasing duality also viz. the invocation for Tara – this being an iconographically quite similar (to Kali) Devi-form, very much a Protectress \[and we note the meaning of ‘Tara’ ( तारा ) as ‘Star’ (with which it is etymologically cognate, as it should happen) – a ‘Light’ in the Black; even though somebody is likely to wish to emphasize the *other* ‘Tara’ ( तार ), which refers to carrying across … in this case, the darkness, the peril \[compare Ancient Greek ‘Nectar’ – to \[safely\] carry through Death\]\].

We are also reminded of \[well, I was, at any rate – your local experience may vary\] the instruction in Shiva Purana II 1 4 54 that the pious devotee may utilize the “Axe (Kuthara) of Shiva’s Name” to ward and strike back against the salience of ‘Shocati’ ( शोचति ) \[the root for that term शुच् (‘Shuc’), “refers at once to ‘grieving’, ‘mourning’, ‘being in a state of clear (and loud) emotional distress’ … and yet also to ‘burning’, ‘consuming’, and to the gleaming, shining, radiance of fire.”, to quote myself upon the subject; and in-context, is an apt summation of the travails of existence, Samsara … which, yes, ‘Time’, indeed\]

And certainly, in terms of ‘Defences’ – whether against ‘Sleep’ (a ‘Cousin of Death’, or otherwise related more closely, contingent upon which exegetical one is running from) or other and more injurious foes … “Durga”, repeated in mantrasic form should prove rather literally that.

‘Durga’, after all, quite directly being ‘The Impassable’, ‘The Unvanquishable’, ‘The Inaccessible’ – and being also a way to refer to a strongpoint, a fortification.

Most, of course, would think instantly of that most formidable of Goddess-forms – and thus we have an interesting duality with the other \[non-Kali\] deific form earlier mentioned, Tara. Insofar as there is ‘Impassable’, and also ‘Carrying Across’.

‘Impassable’ to others, perils – yet ‘Carrying Across’ of the devotee and protecting them *through* these, that is to say ‘rendering passable’, all the same.

There is an interesting progression toward greater Light visible, culminating of course with the Dawn – and we are reminded of the situation of Ushas in the Vedas being hailed quite prominently as a Warrior Goddess in various verses; ‘Rays of Light’ being as Her Arrows, etc. and the frequently encountered notion of darkness driven back as an adversary elsewhere therein. \[We are also reminded of the situation of Durga’s great appearance in the Devi Mahatmyam – wherein Her manifestation is described as a Mountain (Parvata) of Tejas \[‘Radiance’, ‘Fire’; but also ‘Sharpness’, ‘Potency’, ‘Fierceness’, and ‘Violence’ – ‘Ultra-Violent Light’, indeed\]

And, for that matter, that ‘Bring the Dawn!’ tagline with which we had concluded several of our works in recent months which had focused upon or after-action recounted some of the more ‘live-fire’ efforts and exercises conducted by some of our number in active resurrection of Indo-European piety amidst the European (etc.) spheres.

The ‘Dark Age’ of the second-to-last verse is, of course, the Kali Yuga … and it is once again a studied juxtaposition to have the ‘She’ Who can Save – that is to say, Kali – doing so amidst the context of the Kali Yuga; just as it is a juxtaposition for ‘sinners’ and ‘saved’ in the next line. The one transforms the other.

Kali (Devi) \[ काली \], a Darkness, protecting (Durga) and carrying through (Tara) the invoking Devotee, from the iniquitous and spiritually toxic ‘Darkness’ of an entirely different kind which is the eponymous Kali ( कलि ) of the Kali Yuga.

That latter ‘Kali’ \[ कलि \] can mean ‘Sin’ – and hence, the root of and (exteriorly) defining characteristic to the ‘Sinner’. Who is, after all, a person who does something sinful (an essential distinction – it means that the state of ‘sin’ is not endogenous and all-consuming *as* the person themselves, but rather something more temporary (‘temporal’ ?) and external thereto) – and can be ‘carried through’ these grasping tendrils of corruption to emerge beyond and above such as the result.

There is more which I could (and probably should) say upon all of this (including a ‘Triple’ Goddess point about the Figures thusly invoked) … but it is well after Dawn here, and as I mention – I haven’t slept, either; albeit I had not thought that it was due to any Durga invocation upon my part.

Perhaps *that* is why I do not sleep so much.

Devi’s Blessing with me – ‘Cha Me’, we would put it.

Although we are also getting rather better at fighting whilst asleep, too.

Jai Mata Di.
