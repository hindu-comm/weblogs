On Joining Forces With Gods As Prayer – Two Greek Maxims

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/368736678_10167951668705574_658164122443276243_n.jpg?w=1000)

In conversation about recent operations, a quote attributed to Aeschylus (in translation) sprang to mind –

“Whenever a person is himself eager, the God also joins in”  
\[Aeschylus, The Persians, 742, seems to be Helm translation\]

Of course, as brightly auspicious a sentiment as this is – we are, as ever, perhaps advised to consider the quote in context.

The original Ancient Greek reads:

“ἀλλ᾽ ὅταν σπεύδῃ τις αὐτός, χὠ θεὸς συνάπτεται.”

It is spoken by the \[Ghost of\] Darius in the course of Aeschylus’ The Persians … and, well, let us just say that it is a sentiment much more ‘equal opportunity’ in scope than one might at first contemplate.

Here’s a few other translations … in context:

“With what a winged course the oracles  
Haste their completion! With the lightning’s speed  
Jove on my son hath hurled His threaten’d vengeance:  
Yet I implored the Gods that it might fall  
In time’s late process: but when rashness drives  
Impetuous on, the Scourge of Heaven upraised  
Lashes the Fury forward”  
\[Potter translation\]

“Alas! Those oracles  
have quickly been proved true, and Zeus has let  
their full prophetic weight fall on my son.  
I had hoped the Gods would somehow hold off  
fulfilling them for several years. But then,  
when the man himself is in a hurry,  
the God will take steps, too. “  
\[Johnston translation\]

“So quickly! So quickly the oracle delivered its deed!  
And Zeus decided these divine prophesies be delivered upon my son’s head.  
I had always thought that these prophesies would be delivered further into the distant future but, if a man rushes to his own doom then the Gods will help him.”  
\[Theodoridis translation\]

“Alas! The fulfilment of the oracles has indeed come swiftly, and it is my son upon whom Zeus has caused their issue to descend. Yet I was confident that, only after long lapse of time, the Gods would in some way bring them to accomplishment; nevertheless, when man hastens to his own undoing, the God too participates with him.”  
\[Herbert Weir Smyth translation\]

This apparition of the Ghost of Darius is that which is illustrated rather evocatively by George Romney below and housed in Liverpool.

As it should happen, this image is one of a pair by this artist depicting the Vision of Atossa \[Xerxes’ mother\] – the other one, which I am rather enamoured by, but unable to find in decent resolution, has the Death of Xerxes more directly depicted: in that case, falling from a chariot, with Greece presented as having caused the fall in question.

Or, we might suggest – being the active agent for the Divine Sanction in question.

In any case, in terms of the sentiment which is often *intended* by those invoking the Aeschylus quotation aforementioned … in part, at any rate – although in some rather select cases, perhaps, and most definitely outward-facingly aimed \[in the manner of the Claymore mine’s famed dictum: “FRONT TOWARD ENEMY”\], with the full thing and its sentiment more actively within mind …

Well, it is another Classical source which springs to our mind. Springs like an olive-press, in fact – salt-water (also integral to proceedings), notwithstanding.

This is a sentiment we have invoked before – and comes to us from a fable attributed to Aesop. Therein, a rich Athenian is said to have been shipwrecked during a storm. And, perhaps understandably, the man is observed to be emphatically beseeching Athena to please save him – promising all manner of things to be offered, done, should he be delivered from his peril.

Another survivor of the wreck swims past and enjoins:

” Σὺν Ἀθηνᾷ καὶ σὺ χεῖρα κινεῖ. “

Or, translated:

“*With* Athena, Also *You* Hand Move”

Or, re-arranged just slightly for intelligibility in more idiomatic English:

“\[Together\] *With* Athena, Also Move Your Hand\[s\]”

That is to say … Get Swimming.

Properly considered – this is not an ‘either/or’ thing. Rather, it is a ‘both’. And a trenchant understanding that it cannot be a situation of merely idly hoping in abstract (even with some considerable vehemency of vocalization on the part of the would-be petitioner) for things to just near-‘effortlessly’ “work out”.

But rather, that human effort under divine guidance and with apt divine empowerment – can most assuredly carry the day.

This gets rather interesting as considered in the nature and context of our own ongoing operations.

Why so ?

Because that Athenian gentleman of the fable is engaged in, I suppose we might call it a form of “prayer”. It is certainly a sort of ‘petitioning’ \[and c.f., perhaps, the Sanskrit prayer-style of ‘Prarthana’ … ‘Pra’ as in ‘(Come) Before’, ‘Artha’ as in ‘Asking’ – ‘I come before You to Ask …’\] … although it is nevertheless done in the abstract. There is *only* the voice and desperation offered. And future promises which may or may not be ultimately fulfilled.

This is not the same thing as the more orthodox, proper, and dare I say … ‘ornate’ approach of Vedic (and, of course, Tantric) rites. Wherein certainly, we may say that a form of ‘prayer’ and ‘petitioning’ is involved … except the whole thing is an *active operation*. It entails so much more than ‘just asking’ – and involves metaphysical engagements, energizings, and genuine *potency* to proceedings.

It is, in short, a ‘movement of hands’ all its own – and one which most definitely moves synchronously toward that of the Divine.

So, to bring it back to Aeschylus …

That Helm translation with which we opened reads:

“Whenever a person is himself eager, the God also joins in”

Perhaps we might amend it slightly for our sentiment – something on the order of “When a man is resolute in his determination such that he undertakes the proper Rites to secure his outcome … the Gods also join in”.
