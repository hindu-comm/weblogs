Roudran Worship Of Ganesha Afore Winning The Three Worlds

We’ve written a [fair amount](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/07/08/on-the-sky-father-as-dragon-destroyer/) in [relation to](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/08/15/the-divine-rite-of-the-covenant-the-underpinning-apex-as-to-the-godly-cosmos-in-vedic-hellenic-eddic-mythic-expression-part-1-presaging-the-triple-arrow-thunder-the-imperative-oath/) Rudra’s mighty deed as Tripurantaka – the Destroyer of the Three Forts (and, implicitly, \[Re-\]Conqueror of the Three Worlds given what said Three Fortifications are locking up in Demonic usage, [per the Aitareya Brahmana’s presentation as to the issue](https://aryaakasha.com/2023/07/08/on-the-sky-father-as-dragon-destroyer/) viz. the Upasads : the Rites of Siege).

The following extract is from the Linga Purana’s recounting as to the myth – and has ‘expanded’ upon the original telling in a rather intriguing fashion most directly pertinent for our hailing of Ganesha this eve \[viz. Ganesh Chaturthi – as well as, of course, for us more generally\].

For context, this is set immediately following the Gods having congealed (into) the various Weapons and Panoply of War which Rudra is to utilize in order to Smash the three otherwise unassailable strongholds of the A’Suras – and it is also after Rudra has successfully negotiated for Himself the station as ‘Pashupati’, the Lord of the Pashus \[‘Cows’/’Cattle’ in more archaic understanding (or, for that matter, ‘Wealth’ – c.f. the Proto-Germanic cognate, \*Fehu) – ‘Domestic\[ated\] Animals’ more generally, and in later scripture, often taken as a broader sense again of ‘leashed’ living beings in an esoteric sense\], from the Gods.

Hence, as applies that last detail, the designation of His Mighty Weapon as the Pashupatastra – c.f. the Mahabharat [wherein Arjuna & Krishna undertake an astral-projecting \[to paraphrase\] / ‘dream-walking](https://aryaakasha.com/2021/11/17/shiva-krishna-arjuna-and-attaining-the-weapon-of-ones-dreams/)‘ venture to go and personally petition Him for this device under such labelling.

He makes ready to carry out the immense deed … and yet something is not quite right, something halts the process as to the procedure …

What can it be?

We shall quote from the Shastri translation:

“Then Vināyaka Himself, the Boy with the exploit of an adult, forbade Devas as He had not been duly worshipped by Devas and said thus—

Śrī Vināyaka said:—

Which man, may he be a Deva or a Dānava, attains perfection in this world without worshipping Me by means of splendid foodstuffs, edibles, etc. Hence, O leading Devas, I will cause impediments in a trice in Your tasks. O leading Devas, how is it that You had attempted to perform this without worshipping Me.

Thereafter all Devas including Indra became frightened. After worshipping that Lord and propitiating Him with all kinds of edibles and foodstuffs, with loaves and sweet-meats They spoke to lord Gaṇeśa—“Let now Our Task be achieved without impediments.”

Lord Rudra, the Chief of all leading Devas, embraced His Son and kissed Him on the Head. He worshipped and propitiated Gaṇeśa with flowers of sweet fragrance and juicy edibles and foodstuffs.

After worshipping Vināyaka the Leader of Chieftains, worthy of being worshipped, lord Rudra Who had the Lord of Mountains for His Bow started along with the groups of Devas and the Chiefs of the Gaṇas, in order to burn the three cities.”  
\[Linga Purana, I 72, Shastri translation\]  

जय गणेश, जय गणेश, जय गणेश देवा ।  
माता जाकी पार्वती, पिता महादेवा ॥
