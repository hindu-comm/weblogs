The Kali Puja Contribution Of Our More Westerly Co-Religionists

Ten days ago – Nine Nights – Arya Akasha undertook a combined operation for Kali Puja.

As the name for the occasion should appear to suggest, this was oriented toward the worship for Kali. And I have already shared some limited photography pertaining to the major ‘fulcrum’ Rite centered in a Smashana in West Bengal \[c.f. Operation \*Kelh₁-ᛏᚹᛟ \].

Yet this was not the only impressive undertaking for the evening – in fact, there were several. Most of which shall remain quite intentionally ‘secret’ … yet not all.

You see, we had also utilized the opportunity to have certain of our non-Hindu (but very definitely of a shared Indo-European religious mindset) … I suppose we ought say ‘co-religionists’ , carry out further interlinked Devotions upon this occasion.

I’ve included photographs from two of the personnel in question – H.E. & I.C. ; who have each undertaken a Three Night observance beginning upon the date in question as their contributions toward both the vijaya of Operation \*Kelh₁-ᛏᚹᛟ , and their own greater degree of familiarity & engagement with the operative conceptry (And Devi – Facing) of their Indo-European Cousins to the East.

In order to make this happen, we had first sought expert qualified guidance & instruction from our dual-qualified Tantrika & Vaidika (Brahminical) oversight – as to what might constitute an ‘accessible’ and reasonably straightforward, yet nevertheless authentic and ‘resonant’ ritualistic formula & approach for non-initiated persons to *safely* propitiate Kali upon that occasion.

This was then translated and reformulated by N. Mukhopādhyāyaḥ and myself \[ Curwen Ares Rolinson \] into a ‘Ritual Manual’ custom-generated for this sectorial phase of the Operation; and thence passed on to several of our people whom we judged to possess at least a certain array of ritual experience from within their own more familiar IE religious sphere, who were clearly pious and ideally with a favourable inclination toward the relevant IE deific complex , prepared to take direction upon ritual performance, and who also had the appropriate degree & orientation of ‘Indo-European religious understanding’ all up to truly make this work.

It also required something a bit special from these volunteers – that they feel comfortable enough (whether in our hands, or more especially with the ‘ethos’ of Indo-Europeanism all up) to actually worship the Goddess via moving more fully within *‘our’* familiarly home territory.

I shall clarify somewhat what I mean by this.

On previous occasions wherein we have been grateful to receive engaged support from our ‘non-Hindu co-religionists’ \[and yes I am going to have to come up with a better term(s) for this\] in the course of an operation … this has often tended to be undertaken by them as a ritual of their own more familiar ‘home’ IE religious sphere, and oriented toward the local co-expressive cognate deific facing which they are more ‘acquainted’ with, accordingly.

More rarely – because it requires a significantly greater degree of expertise in order to be able to do so decently – with select individuals engaged in operative components which simultaneously draw from multiple Indo-European religious spheres within the course of the same Rite.

The former as to these is relatively straightforward enough – all it requires is a reasonable enough grasp of one’s *own* IE sphere’s religious conceptry to be able to carry out a propitiation located (almost) entirely within one’s own tradition , for a Deific Facing similarly situated. The only ‘additional’ bits are the comparative theology co-identification with the deific at the centre of the ‘combined’ operation – and the linking as to purposes between us.

Yet whilst it is one thing to *intellectually* grasp this essence-tial truth that The Indo-European Gods Are The Indo-European Gods … it is quite another to ask somebody to step out of their own familiar / native IE religious sphere in order to carry out a rite to the ‘cousin’ IE perspective’s Vision for the Goddess most directly – and to do it according to *our* IE tradition’s approaches, rubrics, & strictures.

And as for why we did all of that … well, our objectives shall become clearer as with Time.

Operation \*Kelh₁-ᛏᚹᛟ has proven a truly expansive commitment (Vrata) , and we thank all who have under this Aegis contributed to Her ensuing immanency of success : from many fires in multiple quarters shall continue to come the Blessed Illumination through which we shall Guide The Way … Home.

Jai Mata Di !
