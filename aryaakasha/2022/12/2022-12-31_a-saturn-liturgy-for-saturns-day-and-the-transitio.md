A Saturn Liturgy For Saturn’s Day And The Transition Of The Year Into (Re)New

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/arya-akasha-saturn-hymn-1.png?w=640)

Today is Saturday – Saturn’s Day. And, not least because we are at the juncture which demarcates the liminal between the Years … we present something rather special.

A bespoke liturgy for Him, composed by our associate Pereira Juventino \[ Clécio Dauphin \] for an observance that we had undertaken earlier in the year. \[The art, meanwhile, is from SW\]

We have noted that Saturn seems a somewhat ‘overlooked’ deific in the modern age – and with that we do not agree. Hence, we intend to publish several further contributions toward His Worship (in both archaic and modern terms) over the days and weeks to come.

So, to the Liturgy:

“Be unveiled to us,  
Dweller of the Capitol,  
Oh All-sunged Saturn,  
Out from the locks,  
From lashes and walls;  
Out from the bleak sea,  
From the binds and the oblivion.  
Rising Your return in heaven,  
You who signs everything with  
Your Name, turning the Cosmos  
Into an all-shared gilt.  
Lord of unending perfection,  
Source of peace and growth,  
In Whom all things find Themselves  
sufficed, finding themselves out;  
And in their very selves Your veiled  
Wisdom is found. Oh most present God,  
Order’s foundation, Lord over  
The cycle of Ages,  
In Whom congruence and communion  
Are in a magical effort mingled, profiling  
Themselves by the richness of Your hands.  
Everlasting God, Saturn, hail!  
May scepters and laurels, crowns  
And realms be cast  
To Your feet, to be secured  
In Your justice and ordination.  
For the Sun sets into You to  
Find His rest, and finds Your mien  
To be like a lap; and You pour the grains  
From Heavens by thunder and lightning, and  
From Your command the fruits sprout,  
And rise up flecked by the dew;  
And by You all things are nourished,  
And by the sword they nourish in each other.  
For You fade the cradle into  
A shroud, and from the dead You make  
Our bread to grow; the flower, the bud;  
And virtue and the spirit’s prestige.  
Oh Marbled King, joyful, noble  
And tender Capitoline Father;  
And Father of Pearls only,  
By Whom all things are equally  
Loved and reclaimed!  
Drive, Saturn, Your chariot  
to me, and let this pleading  
mystical prayer be received.”

Hail Saturn !
