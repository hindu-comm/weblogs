On The Nature Of Stories (viz. Myth and Mythic Resonance) – From Terry Pratchett

“Because stories are important.  
People think that stories are shaped by people. In fact, it’s the other way around.

Stories exist independently of their players. If you know that, the knowledge is power.

Stories, great flapping ribbons of shaped space-time, have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time. And they have evolved. The weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling…stories, twisting and blowing through the darkness.

And their very existence overlays a faint but insistent pattern on the chaos that is history. Stories etch grooves deep enough for people to follow in the same way that water follows certain paths down a mountainside. And every time fresh actors tread the path of the story, the groove runs deeper.

This is called the theory of narrative causality, and it means that a story, once started, takes a shape. It picks up all the vibrations of all the other workings of that story that have ever been.

This is why history keeps on repeating all the time.”  
  
– Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad.

\[Art, in case anyone is wondering, is the rather famous circumstance of Vyasa – the compiler of the Vedas, per traditional belief (that is to say … in some senses, a literary connoisseur with quite the perspective upon multiple parallel, interlocking, fields of narrative and their incredible potencies of resonance) ; in this particular instance, narrating the Mahabharata to Ganesha, Who is doing the writing. \]
