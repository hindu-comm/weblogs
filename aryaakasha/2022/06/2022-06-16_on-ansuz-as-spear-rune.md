On Ansuz As Spear-Rune

Recently, we had a brief interaction on twitter pertaining to the notion of ‘Ansuz’ as a ‘Spear’. My interlocutor, a Scandinavian by the name of Sindri (@DrinksStupid), had asserted that the Tiwaz rune seemed much closer – and the Ansuz not at all.

So, here’s a slightly edited run-through of my remarks there upon the subject:

—

I don’t disagree that the *primary* sense of Ansuz isn’t ‘Spear’ ; however it does appear to be part of the broader meaning-field for same. We can demonstrate this quite easily. The Rune ᚫ … in Anglo-Saxon, Aesc, continues the shape & part of other saliencies.

What does ᚫ mean there? Ash\[tree\], and Spear. As we should expect. As is also the case in Ancient Greek \[viz. μελίᾱ \], words for Spear and words for the wood one makes a good spear from, are functionally coterminous.

We also point to the earlier remark viz. ‘Aescling’ in relation to incoming Nordic population. Which, sure, you *could* read in the other way as being descended of Askr (‘Ash\[-tree\]’) – except I do not think that is mutually exclusive \[c.f again, the Ancient Greek mythic situation mentioned in my earlier ‘On The Indo-European Symbolism Of The Ash Tree – And The Ensuing Origins Of The Spear-Race Of Man’ … effectively, the ‘Bronze Age’ race of Man being produced from the Meliae – the ‘Ash-Nymphs’, and being appropriately warlike in disposition in fairly direct consequential result\]

Now, the logical point to raise here is that Ansuz didn’t just turn into Aesc in Anglo-Saxon – but also into several other runes. These include ᚩ (Os) and ᚪ (Ak – ‘Oak’).

The rune-poem makes for interesting reading viz. Os – because it situates it exactly as we should expect … eloquency and wisdom. The Mouth, Speech. We may say: an Odinic competency.

Now, of course, at this point it is logical to again – bring up that the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem, such as it is, is a post-Christianization development. Wherein the pre-Christian elements have … been somewhat obscurated.

This is not incorrect.

HOWEVER –

The thing is, *all* Rune Poems that have come down to us are similarly impaired. Some more overtly than others. And the Anglo-Saxon one, rightly or wrongly, is several hundred years earlier than, say, the Icelandic.

There’s also some *very intriguing* evidence to suggest the possibility that the Anglo-Saxon rune poem and its associated conceptions may have influenced the later Icelandic – particularly viz. ‘Tir’ … but uh .. more on that some other time.

Point is, the cluster of concepts found with the Anglo-Saxon ‘Ansuz’ descendant cluster of Runes are quite clearly Odinic. What does this mean for our purposes ?

Odin is Geirtyr. Spear-God. This is a remarkably ancient Indo-European conception. We see it in my own native Hindusphere also – Shiva is Shulapani \[‘Shula’ – Spear, so ‘Spear-in-His-Hand’\], etc. We see it with the Greek understanding for the Weapon(s) of the Sky Father deific (c.f my World-Spear piece linked above).

So. The ANSUZ rune is, demonstrably, a very Odinic rune indeed. It directly pertains to Him and His competencies, capacities, associations.

One of these, per the Anglo-Saxon rune; and also the theology, is the Spear.

Personally, I also think that the shape of the rune is similarly uncoincidental – it has long looked to me like a war-head upon a stave; but that may be me seeing things … and it is interesting to note that Odin also has a Sword association, too.

Now, as a final point … something I have been pondering is the famed Kragehul I inscription – in particular the triple ‘Gebo-Ansuz’ bindrune set found carved into the shaft of the Spear in question.

There are a few interpretations – and for what it is worth, i think that the conventional one has validity \[that being of ‘Gebo-Ansuz’ as in ‘Gift to the Divine’ \[i.e. ‘sacrificial offering’\]; and/or ‘Divine Gift’ … which may be the other way around\] :

HOWEVER, it also occurred to me one day, aptly enough when I was engaged in the processes of runecarving – that another possibility might bear probative value.

Namely, that ‘GA’ .. was *suspiciously* close to ‘Gar’ – as in ‘Spear’.

But, as I say – speculative on my part, and just mentioned for the sake of interest.
