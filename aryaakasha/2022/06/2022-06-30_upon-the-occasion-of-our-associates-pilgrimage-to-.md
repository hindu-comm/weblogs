Upon The Occasion Of Our Associate’s Pilgrimage To Offer To Athena The Parthenon At Nashville

It is occasionally said that what we do in the sphere of Indo-European religious revival is “Theoretical”. It is.

Yet it is *also* practical – it guides and informs praxis. And here is a heart-gladdening exemplar of our approach in tangible, resolute motion.

This is the Parthenon in Nashville. More specifically, this is the Parthenon in Nashville as photographed by an associate of ours who’s just paid a visit to same to make offering and representation upon his – and our – behalf.

The pilgrimage in question – and yes, I think we can definitely call it that, although I should prefer यात्रा (‘Yatra’) due to its figurative connotation – took our man upwards of seven hours to drive there one way.

And as for why he did it? Well, in a word, because he has Faith.

Faith enough to trust that we knew what we were doing when we sent him there, for a start 😛

Yet as for why this may be described as an ‘Indo-European’ journey – without giving too much away … the persons involved in this endeavour have been drawn from a variety of our religious spheres.

The preponderance would, in fact, be Hindus and Germanic / Nordic. Organizing and executing a mission to a Hellenic / Greek site and Goddess-facing.

Same Goddess – Same Gods – hailed by multiple traditions in recognizably distinctive, yet fundamentally, foundationally coterminous ways.

Now, of course, it almost goes without saying that the Parthenon of Nashville is not the Parthenon of Athens of Old.

Yet it *is* , unquestionably and by very deliberate design, a ‘resonancy’ of that sacred, hallowed space. It is imbued with capacious ‘Shakti’ (in multiple senses, I would surmise) in no small part because of that fact.

We are therefore absolutely without doubt that his pious action in going there, thusly equipped as we could render him, and carrying out the appropriate actions we had discussed and planned … well, it counts.

It matters.

And in a world wherein we so often seem to encounter ‘faith’ as an armchair exercise in internet purity-spiraling … well, it matters doubly – even triply so !

As the Greek proverb states:

Σύν Ἀθηνᾷ καί χεῖρα κίνει.

What does that mean?

(Together) With Athena Move Your Hand !

What does *that* mean?

It means that one must join one’s own efforts to those of the Divine. Tangible human actions out here in the sidereal – both informed by and consciously augmented through the mythic templates of our past.

And working ever, always, towards the Divine Aim.

For those acting in such Service, we are all but a weapon in the right hand of the Goddess.

As it is Friday – ‘ Jai Mata Di ! ‘

And as it is Athena –

καὶ σὺ μὲν οὕτω χαῖρε, Διὸς τέκος αἰγιόχοιο !
