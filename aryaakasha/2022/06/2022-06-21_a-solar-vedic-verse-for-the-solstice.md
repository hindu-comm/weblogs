A Solar Vedic Verse For The Solstice

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/269603497_10165867545355574_8473989574171697990_n.jpg?w=523)

In Praise Of The Sun At Dawn – RV I 115 1:

Chitra, The War-Face Of The Gods Rises – The Strong-Allied Inescapable Fire  
Inciting-to-March Both (Father) Dyaus & (Mother) Prithvi And Those In-Between Them – The Solar Commander Of Both That Which Is Mobile & That Which Is Emplaced

Now I am, of course, being a bit figurative with my renderings there for a particular reason (several, in fact). And that is a decidedly personal parsing which should not be confused with a straightforward translation (even though, yes, all terms are translated with accuracy – just .. in different senses in some cases to the usual).

So here’s the original verse:

चित्रं देवानामुदगादनीकं चक्षुर्मित्रस्य वरुणस्याग्नेः ।  
आप्रा द्यावापृथिवी अन्तरिक्षं सूर्य आत्मा जगतस्तस्थुषश्च ॥

Chitram Devanam-Ud-Agad-Anikam Caksur-Mitrasya Varunasya-Agneh  
Apra Dyava-Prthivi Antariksam Surya Atma Jagatas-Tasthusash-Ca

And, translated literally, in word-order:

Brilliant (Chitra) Of-Devas Up-Go Vanguard / Spearpoint / Warhost / Face The Eye / Glance of Mitra / Comradeship, Varuna / The Celestial Ocean / The All-Encompassing, Agni / Fire  
Filling / Energizing / Activating / Bringing-to-Activity Heaven-and-Earth (DyavaPrithivi), The Mid-Regions (Antariksa), Surya Soul Of That-Which-Moves / The-World Which-Stands-Still And

The Griffith rendering reads:

“The brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the Eye of Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni.  
The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath filled the air and earth and heaven.”

ॐ सूर्याय नमः ॥
