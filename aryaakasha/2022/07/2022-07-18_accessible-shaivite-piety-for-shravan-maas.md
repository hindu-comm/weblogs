Accessible Shaivite Piety For Shravan Maas

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/arya-akasha-shravan-maas.png?w=829)

Shravan Maas – the Shaivite Holy Month – is in full swing.

We had had some questions as to how one can worship the Lord during this month. So here are a few easy ways.

This is particularly for people who may not have the luxury of a fully-equipped Temple or detailed prior knowledge. And remember – Bholenath – the Lord is easily pleased even with smaller acts of devotion, if one’s intent is true.

We would also recommend checking out the ‘Daily prayers to Indo-Aryan deities – explicated on the example of prayers to Lord Shiva’ we had published earlier this year.

Mondays – Somvar \[‘Soma-Day’\] are particularly auspicious for these acts. And hence, here it is … aptly enough, on a Monday: Lord Shiva’s Day !

ॐ नमः शिवाय
