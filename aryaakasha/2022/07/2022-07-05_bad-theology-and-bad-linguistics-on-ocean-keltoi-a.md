Bad Theology And Bad Linguistics – On ‘Ocean Keltoi’ attempting to radically redefine Njordr & Skadi to fit a decidedly modern agenda

Earlier today our attention was drawn to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OceanKeltoi/status/1544028045073424385), from a well-known religious commentator / youtuber.

This isn’t just Bad Theology. It’s also Bad Linguistics.

How? Take a look at “Herakles” / “Hercules”. Root of name is Hera. Does this make Herakles somehow a ‘really’ female deific? I think not.

More to the point –

Observe the situation with, way, Shiva and Shivaa (‘Mrs Shiva’), Rudra & Rudrani, Kaal & Kali … or Jupiter & Juno, the shared stem between Zeus & Dione (our friend the ‘Dyews’ that gives us … Dyaus & Diva), I could go on at great length but you get the idea.

Masculine & Feminine Theonymics for Male & Female Gods doesn’t mean that there’s one God that’s both genders. It just means there’s a pretty standard IE situation going on. Wherein often you’ll find Husband & Wife with Male & Female variants of the relevant theonymic / conceptry.
