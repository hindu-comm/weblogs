We are reminded, of course, of that prominent Ganesha mantra – the first line of RV II 23, which in its original context had been a Brihaspati hailing:

\[ ॐ \] गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम् ।  
ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः शृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम् ॥

Ghaṇānāṃ tvā ghaṇapatiṃ havāmahe

Of the Tribes \[of Prayer\], You are Lord of the Tribes \[of Prayer\], we invoke Thee

Kaviṃ kavīnāmupamaśravastamam।

The Kavi of the Kavis \[‘Poet of / amongst Poets’, ‘Wise amidst the Wise’\], and the Highest (Upama) and Most Emphatic (Tamam) Shravas \[‘Glory / (Shouted) Renown / Praise’\]

Jyeṣṭharājaṃ brahmaṇāṃ brahmaṇas pata

Jyestha \[‘Firstborn / Pre-Eminent’\] Raja \[‘Lord / King’\] of Pious Invocations \[‘Brahmanam’\]; Lord of Prayers \[‘Brahmanaspati’\]

ā naḥ ṣṛṇvannūtibhiḥ sīda sādanam \|\|

\[Please\] Hear us \[and\] grant Aid, being Seated in this Place \[‘Seat’ amongst us – at the Rite in Your Honour\].

जय गणेश, जय गणेश, जय गणेश देवा ।  
माता जाकी पार्वती, पिता महादेवा ॥
