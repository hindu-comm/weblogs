Empowerment Unity – On The Essential Potency Of An Approach Both ‘Indo-‘ As Well As ‘-European’

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/arya-akasha-trishula-bindrune.jpg?w=763)

There has recently been some argument on twitter about the necessity (or otherwise) of drawing from the still-living Indo-European religious spheres of the East, to aid and avail the ongoing resurrection efforts for the Indo-European religious spheres of the (European) West.

As applies our thinking and envisioning upon this front, perhaps one such element may be evocatively illustrative.

This Bindrune is very personal to me. We shall not (yet) go into the processes via which it was brought together, nor for Whom. Nor all the precise intricacies as to its meaning.

For now, it is enough to observe its more ‘exterior’ aspects to formulation. And how these are quite directly that which we are grappling with herein.

It is a Trishula … comprised of Runes.

How is that relevant here?

Because it is *both*.

It does not stop being a Trishula simply because it is comprised out of Runes. It does not stop being comprised of Runes simply because it is a Trishula.

Indeed, it is *actively strengthened* in both senses, *precisely because* it is both and thusly comprised.

So – Indo-European piety in the West … we have various elements, much like those individual Runes, that can be ‘fitted together’. Yet in order to have more than just that – it requires the ‘blueprinting’ that is found, still, elsewhere.

It is entirely understandable if people want to be protective of their own ancestral heritages and traditions from some sort of crass ‘sanded down’ adulteration which smooshes together unrelated things in a way that is harmful. We quite agree.

Yet while there are MOST DEFINITELY some efforts out there which wind up doing that (intentionally or inadvertently) – as exemplified, perhaps, by anyone attempting to syncretize Thor with Jupiter, for one example …

it has tended to be our observation that these are not inherent counter-arguments against utilizing ‘eastern’ IE elements in the re-invigoration of ‘western’ IE faith.

They are simply arguments against *doing it badly*.

Something that applies to *any* cross-IE effort.

After all – that ‘Thor-Jupiter’ thing is not something that happened because somebody brought in Vedic elements.

It happened due to entirely internal miscommunication between late-Roman (and iirc post-Christianization) religious sphere and the Germanic.

In any case, to turn our attentions back to what I was getting across with that Bindrune … if we look closely, we can see that there are ‘hidden sources of strength’ to be found within it. There are resonancies to it that are far greater than what would stand in isolation.

The Trishula is the Spear of Mahadev, and it is the World-Tree – the Axis Mundi. If i wanted to depict the Spear of Odin as a Rune – the Ansuz by itself should prove mostly sufficient. And yet … there is much more depth conveyed in various fashions via what I have wrought there

So, we find ourselves with a choice. Continue to utilize *only and exclusively* elements found within *one* IE sphere at a time … or recognize that The Indo-European Gods Are The Indo-European Gods, and that there are mutually reinforcing skeins to be woven together in might.

Now, I am a very conservative man. I do not go in for a lot of the more … overt ‘syncretism’ about the place. Because I have no need to. (he says, immediately after having posted a Bindrune of literally Indo-European saliency …).

I have Hindu ritual elements – and Hindu priests, and that works for me. Indeed, *it works*, and so we are doubly justified in that being what works for us.

I would see little need to ‘go outside’ that – except when I do, because I get Told to, or others need assistance.

I also, earlier this year, was given a Galdr invocation by a close and trusted associate. It was in English. I balked at this and said how could we possibly have a legit Germanic religious invocation in English. He pointed out to me several things –

i\) that English is a Germanic language, so the fact it is not Proto-Norse surely does not count against it if we are operating Germanically (it doesn’t for Old Norse, after all)

ii\) that he had composed it in the exact and proper Metre for such things

And with resonant features

Now as I say – I am a conservative man. But I trust some of those around me to know what they are doing. And so we made use of this.

And do you know what … it *worked*. I was … not expecting it in the slightest, but there it went.

It seemed to me rather remarkable. And I have re-evaluated some things in fairly direct consequence as a result. I do not – for the record – condone people using (modern) English in invocations where more archaic & proper language is available.

But it showed that we can, perhaps, have some interesting ‘innovation’. Not just saying things in English – but a Germanic invocation in a Germanic language, using Germanic Galdr metre and Germanic poetic elements for the metaphysics embedded as well.

My point in invoking that instance here is precisely that it is a case wherein those who think we are *purely* restricted to what is black-letter written in Sturluson or whatever (rather than *making use of tools* congealed around a certain essence) … are perhaps missing out.

However, another point can and must be raised. That of ‘incompatible metaphysics’.

People in Western IE sphere often offer Wine. It is something that *does* show up *in specific context* in some Tantrika contexts in East.

That is OK for those.

Yet – the thing that worries me is people not respecting that these are .. different spheres, and attempting to ‘cross-over’ too much, and doing so in frankly incautious manner … and getting themselves into great trouble through such carelessness.

Where I think there is very definitely legitimacy to being quite careful and *not* just ‘it’s all Same Gods so we can draw from multiple IE religious spheres in any given operation’ is precisely that sort of element.

And the trouble that this brings, is because we have the most detailed metaphysics *for* the Hindusphere, and because we are so often making use of Hindu deifics and ritual formulaics to ‘inform’ what is going on elsewhere ..well, this tends to mean the H. elements are precedent

Which leads to the perhaps understandable opposition – “why can’t we use x element that’s briefly mentioned in y Classical / Nordic text” “because that would violate Hindu ritual conditions”

People feel that they are being cut off from their own ‘proper’ ways as a result.

I have some sympathy for that view. But until there is a very definite answer as to why x ritual element *should* be there and is appropriate in a relevant ritual context, I think erring on the side of caution is the *least* one can do in terms of piety.

Yet it is an ‘economy’ (by which i also mean ‘exchange’ and ‘development / cultivation of value’) which few care to practice.

They want *their* Ancestral Traditions (as interpolated by a later / foreign commentator, often), entirely, unvarnished.

And I do think there is a feeling of ‘inferiority’ that goes alongside this. We have often encountered people from Nordic / Germanic sphere who get quite angry – they feel *personally* affronted when we say that there are not the elements for ‘High Religion’ anymore there (yet).

Unfortunately, this is a simple statement of fact. And it is not *their* fault, nor is it the Gods’ fault. We absolutely do not seek to insult somebody who declares their faith in Odin. Quite the contrary ! We wish to *help* him and Him in earnest!

Yet the situation we grapple with – somebody once asked the question. What is more childish – a youngster that is afraid of the dark, or an adult that is afraid of the light.

We think that once the light has been properly explained – and been *shown* to be the same Devas (Deus / Dei, -Tyr, Tivar, etc.) … well, it is incumbent upon people to decide whether it is that they are serious about worshipping the Gods, or aesthetics and remains of heritage.

There is *absolutely nothing wrong* with taking pride in one’s heritage – and feeling hard-done by when myself or some others turn up and say “we need to incorporate these ‘foreign’ elements in order to truly resurrect the religion of your ancestors .. ish”

That must be respected.

But we are not in this ‘game’ because we are here for our own emotions. We are in this quite serious endeavour – the most profound endeavour to which modern man might ever seemingly be called upon in which to serve

(precisely because it is going back prior to modernity .. and by ‘going back prior’ I do not simply mean ‘to the past’ but to the transcendent which has informed both past *and* shades of the present, and *can* fulfil the guiding light to the (re-)construction of the future)

for Them. The Gods. And, of course, our own descendants as well. We do not wish for *them* to have to grow up in a bereft and entirely mortal universe, so we are re-immortalizing it as and where and in the manners that we trenchantly can.

So – the question is a simple one.

If you have the means and the mechanisms via which we are fairly certain that the Gods can be worshipped and properly propitiated … what is your meaningful objection to not making use of these in earnest.

If you should feel it is because you are ‘uncomfortable’ with these, because of some personal predilections for ‘only’ your own most immediate ancestral sphere being invoked …

… then frankly – sounds like a ‘you’ problem.

I am not saying there are not legitimate points of concern about all of this. Quite the contrary. I am open to dialogue (or, as we are doing currently, ‘monologuing at length’) and exploring these- because ultimately we *do* have a Divine Duty to get all of this *right* (and rite)

But having thought about all of this *extensively* for some years now – and worked with some excellent persons from *most* major IE spheres ‘behind the scenes’ (seriously, the amount of stuff I *don’t* talk about in public … ) and put even into practice –

I am sure we are on the right (and, as I say – the ‘rite’, the righteous) track.

Only question is:

Who wants to come join us thereupon.

The Indo-Europeans – and it is *pointedly* both “Indo-” and “-European” – have a World to Win.

If people wish to stay at ‘home’ rather than join us for ‘Homa’ –

Well, that is their business.

And, it should seem, their business ‘exclusively’.

Meanwhile, we shall continue pressing on with great and imperious vigour.

‘Krinvanto Vishvam Aryam’, some might suggest – and, indeed, it has been Arya Akasha’s de facto motto for some time.

To ‘Make the World Arya (Again)’.

We have often invoked it in something of a ‘broader’ sense. Re-incarnating, ‘resurrecting’ and ‘reconnecting’ elements of the Indo-European Faith *across* the World.

In addition to playing our part in seeking to protect, uphold, empower the still-living and very much literally ‘Arya’ religious dimension that we thrivingly term the Hindusphere.

We do not view these as being ‘separate’ missions.

Quite the contrary.

We view these as being the same cause – manifested rightly differently in rightly different climes; yet nevertheless serving the same Gods, and mutually reinforcing in each and either direction.

With all of that in mind, we would hope this effort is seen by our co-religionists in amidst the Western IE sphere for what it is:

An offer of assistance, and the bestowal of a most potent (and battle-tested) Weapon, indeed.

It is over to them as to whether they take us, and Her, up accordingly.
