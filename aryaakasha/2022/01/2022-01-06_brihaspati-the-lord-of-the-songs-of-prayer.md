Brihaspati – The Lord of the Songs of Prayer

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/jupiter-the-saver.jpg?w=636)

Today is Thursday – Jupiter’s Day, the Day of Brihaspati.

So therefore … some rather modern art of Brihaspati – also known as
‘Guru’, and yes in astrological terms linked to the Planet Jupiter.

Now in Vedic terms, Brihaspati is an interesting figure. The name,
effectively, means the ‘Lord of the Songs of Prayer’. However the
‘Interesting’ element comes from establishing just Who Brihaspati is –
both in internal Hindu theological terms, as well as in comparative
Indo-European schemas.

The issue arises because Brihaspati – as with several other Vedic
theonyms – is not only a theonym … but is also a title.

In the latter context, it sometimes seems to occur to refer to a
(mortal, human) priest \[although this *may* in some cases be a case
wherein the priest is actually bearing the ‘essence’ of the God as part
of the ritual’s ‘mythic resonance’ / Eliadian ‘eternal return’\] – in
other instances, it seems to refer to Lord Indra.

The matter becomes even *further* complex when we consider one of the
major occurrences in the mythology for Brihaspati – wherein He carries
out a Vajra-employing smiting of a demon-dragon that has stolen and
hoarded something precious to the Gods.

It would be simple enough to therefore conclude, as some have, that it’s
simply another Indra theonym.

Except here’s the thing.

First and foremost – we have direct statement of the seeming equivalency
of Brihaspati and Rudra in the Vedas \[for example, in the Black
Yajurveda’s Taittiriya Aranyaka, I 10 1\]

But second – and in some ways more intriguingly – we *also* have fairly
direct resonancy between that aforementioned major deed of Brihaspati in
the Vedas … and something Odin does in the Ynglinga Saga.

I’ve looked at this more directly and extensively in my previous “On
Odin Brihaspati As Song-Smith – The Sung Seizing Of The Wealth Of Cows”.

The reason why this is salient here is because it is an example of the
Indo-European comparative theology acting as ‘test’ for the hypothesis:

We know that Brihaspati and Odin share this deed in common.  
We know that Odin is Rudra.  
We know that Rudra appears also to be Brihaspati.  
Therefore, via triangulation of analysis, we can suggest it quite
plausible for Brihaspati to indeed be Rudra as Odin (Rudra) and
Brihaspati carry out the same deed.  
And we can further extend this typology to probe other Indo-European
mythologies to see if the Sky Father carries out like actions elsewhere
in the canon.

But more upon that some other time.

This also helps to point out the essential difference between how Indra
accomplishes the outcome in question ‘gainst Vritra (for the most part)
as compared to how Brihaspati does so ‘gainst Vala (for the most part):

The Power of Prayer ! That most mighty of weapons indeed!

Indra makes use of immense strength and potency and swings a physical
weapon (which is metaphysically empowered).

Brihaspati utters a few verses of the High Speech, the Sacred Speech,
with the correct intent and understanding – and an immense Orbital
Bombardment fit to slew off the side of a mountain begins. The Vajra in
question is a Meteor !

Similar ultimate outcome – the Dragon is Slain, the Treasure is
Liberated and Restored – however, rather different approaches.

Even if, strictly speaking, Somebody still carries out the relevant
metaphysical empowerments and unlockings for Indra’s Vajra (and Soma) ,
vitally employing Vak Devi (Goddess of Speech) to do so.

In any case, let us quote some fine Brihaspati scripture !

RV II 23:

1 We call Thee, Lord and Leader of the Heavenly Hosts, the Wise among
the Wise, the Famousest of all,  
The King supreme of Prayers, O Brahmaṇaspati: hear us with help; sit
down in place of sacrifice.  
2 Bṛhaspati, God immortal! verily the Gods have gained from Thee, the
Wise, a share in holy rites.  
As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of Morn, so Thou alone
art Father of all sacred prayer.  
3 When Thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, Thou mountest the
refulgent car of sacrifice;  
The awful car, Bṛhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the
stall of kine, and finds the light.  
4 Thou Leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress o’ertakes
not him who offers gifts to Thee.  
Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Bṛhaspati, quelling his wrath:
herein is Thy great mightiness.  
5 No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures
double-tongued have overcome the man,—  
Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard,
Thou keepest Brahmaṇaspati.  
6 Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for Thy service,
sing to thee with hymns of praise.  
Bṛhaspati, whoever lays a snare for us, him may his evil fate,
precipitate, destroy.  
\[…\]”

Now, I have chosen to quote RV II 23 here because not only does it
really do a rather fantastic job of extolling Brihaspati’s salient
virtues (and note also the brief allusion to that aforementioned Great
Deed of opening the mountain so that the Cow(s) of the Gods may come
forth once more from Their imprisonment by the Demon-Dragon) … but in
its opening verses it also is phrased in terms of the Sacral Rite of the
God as Guest, the God as Honour-Guest at a Feast, in fact.

We have discussed this paradigm at length elsewhere – but you see the
logic. The God is Called, Invited, Invoked – and is thence offered a
Seat.

Further, it is still a very *current* Vedic hymnal – for, you see, the
opening verse has become a well-known Mantra of Ganesha.

गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे  
कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम् ।  
ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत  
आ नः शृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम् ॥

Gananam Tva Gana-Patim Havamahe  
Kavim Kavinam-Upama-Shravastamam \|  
Jyestha-Rajam Brahmanam Brahmanaspata  
A Nah Shrnvan-Utibhih Sida Sadanam \|\|

Now, Ganapati is, as many know, a frequently encountered epithet or
theonymic title of Ganesha – indeed, both mean significantly similar
things: the Lord of the Ganas, Lord of the Hosts, Lord of the Warbands,
Tribes, you get the idea.

In terms of the Ganesha mantra in question, it is often these days
interpreted that He is acting as the Lord and Leader of the Ganas of
Prayers – the various forms via which we offer our piety to the Gods;
and as Their Inceptor, as we invoke Ganesha first at the start of our
ritualine proceedings.

There are some potential crossover saliencies also between Brihaspati
and Ganesha – insofar as Both are ‘positive’ and ‘jovial’ Gods of good
nature (and a martial disposition often overlooked to the peril and the
detriment of those who would underestimate Them). Indeed, Both are, we
may say, significantly interested in ‘Openings’ – whether that involves
the standing in custodian vigil over these in the case of Ganesha, or
the carving openings into the side of mountains by Brihaspati.

So, while Brihaspati is still very much a current figure in Hindu
understanding (as anybody carrying out Graha oriented rites must surely
know !) , we *also* find a case of ‘inheritance’ going on here – as
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva, perhaps it is a situation of “Like Father,
Like Son”.

There are some subsidiary points we could potentially make around the
occasionally imprecise correlation of particular Vedic Gods and the
Grahas that are keyed to Them in terms of naming – the energies and
effects, the surrounding, subsequent mythologies which encode
astrological truths which are more ‘complicated’ upon closer inspection
in salient aspect of the Gods Involved

Yet for now, I think, it is enough.

Hail to the Lord of the Songs of Prayer !
