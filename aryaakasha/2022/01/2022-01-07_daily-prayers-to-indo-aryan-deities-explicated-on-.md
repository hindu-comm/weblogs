Daily prayers to Indo-Aryan deities – explicated on the example of prayers to Lord Shiva

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/248345708_9219401528082824_341646934053350577_n.jpg?w=1024)

  
*\[Editor’s Note: this document represents a ‘team effort’ by Arya
Akasha – with much of the work being* *done by O. Rapace, who has
written all of this up. Everything in here has been compiled and
cross-checked with Brahminical oversight to ensure that this represents
not only an ‘**accessible**‘ approach to home piety – but an
**accurate** and an **authentic** one as well. **ॐ नमः शिवाय**  
  
Anyway, we shall let O.R. take over the narration … \[-C.A.R.\] \]*

The following system of simple prayers to Indo-Aryan deities can be
followed by anyone but it is meant mostly for those Indo-Europeans who
recognize that today India is the only standing sovereign IE culture and
Hinduism (or perhaps better to say Sanatana Dharma) is the only relevant
Indo-European faith sovereign today, yet who were born outside of great
Indo-Aryan Dharmic culture and who thus find themselves apart from the
system of varnas, gotras and other social preconditions for proper
following of Hindu religion. Simply put – it is meant for those goras
who are living outside of India, who were not properly initiated into
any authentic sampradaya and especially for those who live in areas
where there are little possibilities for actual physical interaction
with Sanatana Dharma, where there are little to no possibilities of
regularly visiting a mandir etc.

In no way the system presented here should be viewed as something
replacing the potential need to get in touch with deeper and more
fundamental aspects of Sanatana Dharma, be it by pilgrimage to India, by
getting touch with a mandir even if it is farther away than one would
like it to be etc.

Another way how to expand and continue from this system, is the simple
Puja format that Arya Akasha is currently working on and that is of
pan-IE saliency.

The following daily prayers are easy to follow and have relatively
little preconditions. You should be able to pray at least once daily,
following either the full or the quick form.

You may modify some elements of the prayers, like including ghee lamps
instead of candles etc., but do not modify the form of the formulas as
presented. As you can see the form of the salutation formula is \[shrI\]
+ dative-form of the name of the deity + namaHa. Why is that? Well, that
is because in case of the actual example provided \[shrI\] shivAya
namaHa this is something that is permitted by the most strict reading of
the rules for anyone to use, non-Dvijas, mlecchas and by extension
non-initiated goras. There are other forms of this formula, like well
known OM namaHa shivAya (so called Panchakshara), and while it is widely
used, the Hindu religious authorities do not agree whether it can indeed
be used by anyone or whether it is properly reserved only for those who
are authorized to recite actual Vedic mantras.

You see, while in the West, everyone and their mom uses mantras like OM,
namaHa ShivAya etc., it does not mean they are actually entitled to use
them, or perhaps to put it better – than they are properly empowered to
use them. In the best case scenario, more or less nothing happens,
because the individual just doesn’t have what it takes to really tap
into the mantra.

There are some are mantras (and that goes actually for most mantras)
that are to be used only with proper initiation. Generally speaking only
namasmaranas (“divine name mantras”) can be really used by anyone (this
means totally anyone) and they are both safe and powerful enough. These
mantras include the names of the deities, like “Shiva”, “Rudra”,
“Mahadeva” or “Durga”, or the exclamations like “Hare Krishna”, “Har Har
Mahadev”, “Jai Mata Di” etc.

The text of the following prayers was consulted with scholars, both
Western and Indian, to make sure that what is included is indeed
something even a non-initiated gora can rightfully and safely use. The
structure was kept to be as simple as possible, for more advanced forms
of worship that are still usable even by non-initiated goras, check out
the Arya Akasha simple Puja project. What follows is not meant to be a
substitute for the simple Puja project, but an introduction to proper
modes of worship for modern alienated occidental Indo-Europeans, who, so
to say, see the Light shining in the East, and who yearn to reconnect
with the living streams of Indo-European Faith.

## **Everyday Morning Prayer**

**  
**Morning prayer (both the full and quick form) can be done dressed in a
dry towel or a dry bathrobe or in your day home or work clothes,
provided they are clean enough. This all at least after washing your
hands and face, including mouth. Ideally you would have special clothes
and will take a bath or a shower before. Do not wear shoes or slippers,
you can wear clean socks though.

Steps or elements in \[…\] are not required, but can be included, steps
or elements in {…} are not required, but are highly recommended. In case
of lightning the candles during the morning prayer, do not forget to put
the flame out (not by using your breath as that is not the proper way)
before you go to work etc. In case you are making the offering of food,
the most safe approach is to use the nuts (like walnuts etc.), as they
are easy to store and they stay fresh for long time. Be sure not to
store them directly on the ground and keep them somewhere separate from
your other food. The next day you should dispose of the offering, not by
putting it into trash etc., but by putting it outside somewhere where
animals can take care of it.

After lightning of the incense stick it is recommended to assume a
sitting praying position (sitting on both knees), or position on a bent
knee etc. depending on the height of the altar and of the Murtis (you
should be able to see the Murtis but you should not be standing towering
above them). In case your altar is placed relatively high (so that you
do not tower above the Murtis) you can remain standing.

In case you have made a mistake or an error during the “quick” version
of the prayer, feel free to include the supplication for forgiveness of
errors made.

## **Everyday Evening Prayer**

  
Evening prayer (both the full and the quick form) can be done dressed in
pyjamas you sleeps in, provided they are clean enough, in a dry towel or
a dry bathrobe. It is understood you have already taken a bath or a
shower. If not, then at least hands and face are washed, including
mouth. It is also possible, if needed, to be in your day home or work
clothes. In that case you need to follow minimal washing requirements
mentioned above. Ideally you would have special clothes and will take a
shower before. Do not wear shoes or slippers, you can wear clean socks
though

Steps or elements in \[…\] are not required, but can be included, steps
or elements in {…} are not required, but are highly recommended. Please
note that for the evening prayer the lightning of the candles is meant
as a required step (for the full form of the prayer). Either let the
candles burn out naturally or put the flame out (not by using your
breath as that is not the proper way) before you go to sleep etc. In
case you are making the offering of food, the most safe approach is to
use the nuts (like walnuts etc.), as they are easy to store and they
stay fresh for long time. Be sure not to store them directly on the
ground and keep them somewhere separate from your other food. The next
day you should dispose of the offering, not by putting it into trash
etc., but by putting it outside somewhere where animals can take care of
it.
