The Rantsplication Shall Continue – Until The Religiosity Improves

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/christianity-hinduism-a.png?w=608)

How on EARTH does somebody come to the conclusion that Christianity is somehow ‘more Aryan’ than Hinduism … the literal Arya religion – in fact, the *last living* Arya religion on the planet.

I do not understand this “Heavily Dravidified” meme that keeps going around. Is the argument that the Gods somehow changed? Is the argument that the ways of worship are completely foreign? Is the argument that we no longer use Vedic hymns, rites, on a regular basis .. ?

Because this should prove most curious an assertion. We can readily identify the same Gods hailed today in the modern age as are sung of in the most archaic Vedic scripture of near four thousand years ago ! We worship in manners that are often – again – directly informed via the Vedic templating. We use the same Mantras, we use the same theological understandings, we even make use of the same ritual elements.

The Hellenic religion of the high Classical age was not exactly the religion of Mycenae. Does this stop the one from being coterminous with the other as its logical development? I do not think so. Does it stop either from being Indo-European? Negative.

Krishna has been spoken of. Interestingly, it should appear that this dragon-subduing deific is, indeed, running on a fundamentally Indo-European archetype .. we have *repeatedly* looked at this in our work over the past year or so.

And handily, even though it is glossed over by the HKs etc., we also find this Krishna urging the worship of the Sky Father; urging the worship of Devi !

One should also, perhaps, consider the expert analysis of Professor Witzel upon the matter – who observes the strong coterminity of Hinduism and archaic Vedic era elements .. and why people even in academic sphere can overlook same.

Meanwhile, in the course of my own investigative analysis, I have again and again observed that what’s supposedly ‘non-Arya’ in origination … actually has strong coherency with other IE religions to the West.

And is often just ‘overlooked’ by people with insistent typologies

You see this with Shiva elements; you see this with Devi elements; what we wind up with is the realization that the understanding of what actually constitutes archaic Indo-European religion is .. sketchy on the part of people declaring various things to be ‘non-IE’.

And I should emphasize – that’s not aimed at anyone here; people who *want* there to be strong non-IE saliency to Hinduism because they don’t like IE and its implications are quite guilty of this. Feminist revisionist ‘historiography’ / theology is one eg &”Dravidian Nationalism”

And you know what the real ‘kicker’ is in all of this?

You want to find *really* archaic Vedic religious understanding and performance … where do you go ? The South. ‘Dravida’ country. The Brahmins down there are famously renowned as including the most conservative and archaic

When anthropologists wanted to analyze the Agnicayana rite – the famously complex and fantastically intricate ritual which, in that form, is referred to as the ‘FireBird’ and finds direct Vedic expression – where did they go ? South India.

Reject False Typologies

Embrace True Arya Tradition !
