Be The Boys You Wish To See Back In Town – The Ganas of Shiva and Thiasos of Dionysus

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/arya-akasha-shiva-dionysus-triumph-bhutagana.png?w=748)

Shiva & Dionysus – but, then, I repeat myself.

Dionysus pictured alongside His θῐ́ᾰσος (‘Thiasos’ – likely from ‘Thyrsus’, the sharp-pointed staff of Dionysus and borne also by His Ardent Devotees); Shiva, in amidst His Ganas (from the same root as ‘Genus’ – effectively, groups or companies of His Higher Devotees; most famously, the BhutaGana – the Company of Ghosts)

We have discussed elsewhere at some length and depth these such manifestations (including the Wild Hunt, Einherjar, etc.) – and made the intriguing observation that particularly as applies Shiva and certain other Masques of the Sky Father, these are often congealed as *Marriage Processions* : the Bhole Ki Baraat of Shiva representing the standout example, although in both the Dionysian and Poseidon / Neptune spheres we find broadly correlate exemplars as well.

So .. who’s up for a triumphal march in a God’s service and the embodiment of a Myth .. ?
