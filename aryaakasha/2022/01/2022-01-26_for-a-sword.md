For A Sword

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/x650-doc022-9-kopiya.a31.jpg?w=458)

Much of today has been Svati – The Sword (although several other meanings/etymologies are noted – and as for which one is correct .. the answer is ‘Yes’).

And so, therefore we have beautiful art of Kali wielding a fine Ramdao – the famously distinctive curved and eyed blade utilized in the practice of Bali, Sacrifice.

As many shall note – the weapon is rather different to what one would more usually see for a combative instrument. It is not the thin and agile darting sweep of the Tulwar. Instead, it is designed to kill at a single, heavy decapitation stroke. The better to swiftly end suffering and sunder with great purpose.

It is also not the rather smaller, handheld Kartika \[‘Cutter’; also known as a ‘Kartri’\] – often referred to as a ‘flaying knife’ and utilized for smaller ritual actions.

Instead, the Ram-dao’s salient purpose is there right from one of the more archaic prominent attestations for the Goddess: bringing down the

*biggest* of offerings. The most famous of which would surely have to be
the buffalo-demon Mahishasura.

Wherein, while it is conventionally Durga (the same Goddess, in a different form) Who decapitates the Buffalo(-headed) Demon, we can nevertheless detect more than a hint of resonancy between *that* particular sacral slaying and the latter, more overtly sacrificial employments to such a Blade.

Given the salient potencies of Mahishasur, it should also therefore be understood as an excellent opposer to the wielders of illusion and Black Magic.

The Eye of the Blade represents Her Presence within the Sword; and, as we can see, the Sword (Swords often being utilized in ritual context

*as* Devi, so to speak) has recently tasted blood.

It would appear that the artist (as per usual – Andrey Yarashevich) has drawn the Blade in emulation of the style of Weapon utilized in Nepal and Bengal: two noted centers of Goddess worship, aptly enough.

Now there are quite a number of smaller details that reveal themselves upon closer examination of the depiction (Devi having the Moon as an Earring, for instance – assumedly with the Sun as Earring on the other, non-visible ear).

But we shall leave those for others to notice.

Jai Mata DI !
