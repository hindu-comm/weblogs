On Hearing The Call And Becoming An Active Protagonist – A Conversational Excerpt

![](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/ezguztpweakzo9h.jpg?w=628)

Recently, we had been talking with a new associate about, I suppose we may say, the ‘journey of faith’ – and this notion of ‘hearing the call’ to do as we are doing. We are Hindus – however, I think that it applies quite pervasively to adherents from all the various Indo-European spheres who have found themselves similarly engaged.

To quote his rather excellently turned phrasing upon the subject:

“I don’t mean to fall in the pit of protagonism but I feel the call of the deities in a sense.”

Now, in terms of my reply (slightly edited and somewhat expanded to make a few things clearer)…

\[C.A.R.\]:  
I like that phrase – “pit of protagonism”; but i mean …

The Christians have the concept of the ‘personal Jesus’ \[as does Depeche Mode\]

Now, the curious thing is – like, i do not mean for a moment to entertain the .. rather self-aggrandizing stuff you hear some wannabe cult-leaders espousing around “X God talks to me” … but at the same time –

I have never seen it that deities would have no reason to subtly guide, impel people .. even people who are not great Saints, in various directions.

If you are hearing a call – you are meant to hear a call, it is as simple as that.

It does not mean that you are self-aggrandizing yourself to make yourself into the solipsistic pseudo-hero of an ‘it’s all about me’ kinda play.

It just means that you have come to an awareness that you have a duty – a duty of love, and yes, a duty – and that you want to fulfil it.

And that means heading in the direction that that subtle ‘call to your soul’ has come from.

Indeed, it is, in truth ,a call in your soul. And I mean that quite directly. *As* a soul, in fact – at least in a sense.

I shall explain :

Now, the Nordic .. anthropogenic myth, we might say, the creation of Askr & Embla , the first man and woman –they’re … trees – Ash-tree and Elm. In terms of themetaphor inherent to this, in part it is thatbasically they are barely alive- not sentient, sapient, whatever we wish to call it.

Odin (aided and availed by two further figures) turns up and ‘invests’ we may say, these soon-to-be humans with .. certain divinely bestowed qualities.

Now, the thing i find fascinating about this –is that the state prior to this investiture, when they weren’t really human …they are described as ‘Orloglauss’. Lacking in Orlog.

Orlog gets translated as ‘fate’ – and that’s not inaccurate.‘Dharma’ would be a good translation actually.

‘Supernal Law’ is literally what Orlog means – log as in ‘law’, (or precedent – hence i suppose in part the ‘fate’ dimension); Or, as in ‘outside’ .. you get how it works.

So … once they have these divine investitures, –which include, effectively, ‘soul’ \[‘Ond’ is the term often translated as that which is interesting, although we should also of course note ‘Odr’ – due to its functional parallel with Greek ‘Menos’\]  
\[Ond is from same root as ‘Wind’ by the way – you are familiar of course with the 11 Rudras that are in every man as breaths. Like that. Coz Odin\] … well, once they are in possession of these things, they are no longer ‘Orloglauss’.

Inherent within the fact that they are made ‘human’ is that they attain something very much more than human into the bargain as well.

Anyway, where i am going with this is quite simple.

To be human, per this Nordic anthropogenic myth – it means to have this innate connexion to not just Divinity, but to Cosmic Law – we would say Rta.

It is the Absolute, Brahman, funnily enough \[and turns up in-universe as Devi, quite frequently\].

So, you went down a particular path .. you learned some things, you did some ‘cleaning’ we might say of house, inside your head and your heart. And after removing some obstructions an dust and such, you got a better sense of who and what you were –and you realized that connection existed.

And now you are ‘following the thread’, so to speak, back Up to where it leads. Perhaps we might suggest it akin to having become awarethat there’s something .. else , at the bottom of the glass you had been drinking from – and reacting accordingly.

That does not mean you are self-aggrandizing or falling into a “pit of protagonism”. That means you are lifting yourself out of a morass , a sort of secular morass in fact

And if you have to be a protagonist to do so –well, what is more heroic, within one’s own psyche, than precisely that.

Because , you see –it enables you then being able to perform duty, help others, serve Them.

It is a curious paradox in a sense –a ‘protagonism’ that at once makes you a narrative subject in a rather more highlighted sense …precisely because you become more aware of and more keen to serve, Beings far greater than we.

And this, I have often observed, makes it all the more remarkable that we *can* and we *do* thence ‘hear’ these Callings out to us. Whether in forms immediately intelligible to us, or otherwise.

Which does not have to be the sorts of ‘high-CGI-budget’ direct theophany / darshana type ‘directives’ in the manner of the experiences of a ‘prophet’ one often thinks of due to certain prominentexemplarsof a perhaps somewhat ‘Old Testament’ style hue.

It can be something much more subtle, and much more broadly, pervasively acting than that. And which – at least, in the experience of myself from time to time and some of the others I look after – has occasionally been of the sort of thing one does not necessarily even realize it is happening (or its major, salient purport) until a broader ken of vision is afforded to us via events thence becoming capable of being viewed in the rear-view mirror.

If Gods can guide Nations (and They Can) – then They can also move and/or motivate the persons (whether in aggregate or individually) who make up those nations.

So, to return to that sense of narrative ‘protagonism’ – I think, in part, that is the best way to think of it. We are *all* (most of us, anyway) ‘protagonists’ in that certain sense. We are, quite literally, on the ‘right side’ of the ‘argument’ (Ancient Greek ‘Agon’ – a ‘contest’, particularly prominent to name a phase of a Greek work of theater wherein just such a ‘debate’ ensues); we are also, again quite literally, ‘pro-‘ – in the sense that we are pro-pelling things, we are pushing things, we are energizing and enlivening things. We are putting things forward, and taking our active place in service of They, the Regin of these worlds of ours and beyond.
