Where do you come from, Indo-European Man? The Steppe or the Indus Valley?

This is a question that has some serious resonancy both in the West and in India, for reasons that are somewhat similar and somewhat different. The answers to that question also differ, driven more or less by the similar reasons.

Now, I believe that currently our best understanding tends to point to… wait… wait… let’s pause for a moment… because… does this question actually matter? Does it really matter? Well, why… I believe it does. Yet, I also know that it really doesn’t. Not now, anyway.

Why? Because us getting into arguments and fights over the question of where our Urheimat was located several millennia ago is not only counterproductive, it is literally suicidal.

We are facing the greatest threat to Indo-Europe we ever faced and the last thing we should do is squabble between ourselves. Our mortal enemies, demonic enemies no less, want nothing less than that.

Our past thus becomes weaponized, in many cases directly against us and threatens our present.

Now, before we venture forward with our brief contemplation, let’s address the term Indo-European. Some in India may perhaps object to this term, and for understandable reasons of “why are we just a hyphenated prefix rather than the substantive body”. But that is not the way how to look at the term.

First of all let’s have a substantive look at that. What does this term mean? It relates to the fact that peoples of India and of Europe (and of great many other places where these peoples traveled and settled) share common ties that are traceable on genetic level, on linguistic level as well as (at least until the Christianization of Europe, although it’s kind of more complex than that) on religious level.

We may object to either of those connections, but the truth remains that both Western and Indian Indo-Europeans share common MLBA genetic component, languages they speak are related to each other (and not on superficial levels, like some deniers imagine, but on fundamental levels of “deep” grammar and syntax and vocabulary), and their religions honor same Gods and feature parallels that are on par to those shared on genetic and linguistic level (if not even more strongly than those actually).

These fraternal links hold, and it does not matter whether we ultimately came from the Steppes or from Indus Valley (or for that matter from anywhere else, as the Anatolian theory is perhaps not entirely obsolete yet, and there is also Central Asian origins theory).

Now, let’s have a look at purely formal objection – does “Indo-European” puts “Indo-” as an unimportant prefix and “-European” as the “substantive body”? Not, at least not in my view.

The “Indo-” is rather in a position of prominence, as it is (and it, synchronistically enough, reflects the prominent position of India as the bastion of Indo-European civilization and culture).

Now imagine how the alternative term would look like – “Euro-Indian”. Doesn’t that sound much… worse in some way than Indo-European?

From the point of view of “Out of India” theory, the term “Indo-European” is actually to be preferred, for obvious reasons, as it sounds as if it hints at Indian origins of the “European” component.

For “Euro-Indian” this really comes off the other way. At the end of the day, this is really not important though. We do not have a better term to express our common Family.

Some in the West try to use Indo-Iranic term “Aryan” but it often comes off as not really appropriate use of this term. But I have written on that elsewhere.

Suffice to say here that if we use this term to denote anyone of good character who follows Sanatana Dharma, then we use it in the Right way.

If the Westerners who use it try to somehow “elevate” their feelings of ethnic superiority, then it most certainly is not the Right way how to use that word.

Be it as it may, while it can be used as a shorthand for Indo-European, the baggage in the West that it carries and the fact that this term more properly belongs (in this form, anyway, as Curwen wrote about proper Western “cognates” to it) to Indo-Iranian branch of our Family Tree, means that we should not get overly overboard here in the West when using it.

But I digress. As it is, we in the West should be aware that there is literally nothing “Aryan” about our current civilization. Not now, anyway.

The truth is that the West as a civilization has fallen. It has become the twisted and demonic parody of its previous Self. It has become, in the full sense of the word, demonic, a’suric civilization.

The corruption and rot that started centuries ago, when we betrayed the religion(s) of our forefathers, has now fully taken over and it threatens to mortally infect and destroy the rest of the world.

The West is in a death spiral on a way to oblivion, and it wants to take the Rest with it.

As it is, almost all of Indo-Europa has fallen, we have become like Tolkien’s “Black Numenorians”.

But there is one Indo-European civilization still standing. Hindu India is the last sovereign IE Tradition standing amidst the dark tides of this Age. And it faces the same dissolutive forces that more or less already destroyed and overtook the West and set it on the path to oblivion.

The West has fallen and nothing but Ruins of its past Glory remain. Ruins – and a burning desire to Resurrect, to Rebuild, to Restore.

Something that can only take place by the inspiration we can find only among our Indian brethren. Therefore, even here among the ruins of the West, we stand and look to the shining bastion of our Faith, there across the great white mountains and in between the seas of Indian Ocean. We have lost our Homelands, but there is still hope.

Now, you see why at this very moment in time, it doesn’t really matter if we agree on where our common Urheimat was located millennia ago, whether on the Steppes or in India.

Because today, for any awakened Western Indo-European, India must be viewed as what She truly is. The last standing Heimat.

Bharat Mata is currently the only sovereign Indo-European Realm. In this sense, She is our Mother, wherever we may be.

And it is the duty of all Indo-Europeans, wherever they may be, to stand with India, to stand with our Hindu brothers and sisters in their struggle for the preservation and advancement of Sanatana Dharma. We all have to do our part in this struggle.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

Our struggle is one.

Jai Mata Di!
