Indian Philosophy is one of the areas that the committee is particularly interested in. I apologize that I did not post this earlier, as the deadline is now imminent: Feb 10th. If you would like to apply but cannot quite make this deadline, send me an email and I will ask the search committee if they can slightly extend the deadline in your case:
