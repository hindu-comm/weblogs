New Book Series: Philosophy Across Borders (OUP)

Thereâ€™s a new book series that may interest readers of the Indian Philosophy Blog. You can find the information below.

> Oxford University Press is seeking submissions of proposals for a new > series: Philosophy Across Borders. OUP is committed to publishing > high quality philosophical work that draws on broad sourcing to create > novel philosophy or novel approaches to recognized problems, > methodologies, or approaches. The hope is that books in the series > will exhibit conversation between traditions or cultural sources not > often engaged together. This might include, e.g., engagement between > underrepresented traditions and more widely studied western sources, > but it could also include work that engages multiple underrepresented > traditions not often engaged together. The goal is not to re-create > comparative philosophy, but to provide accessible philosophical work that simply does philosophy in an idiom that is open and global. If you have a proposal for the series, please contact any of the series editors below or the OUP editor, Peter Ohlin.

> Series Co-editors: Kristi Dotson, Bronwyn Finnigan, Jonardon Ganeri, Amy Olberding, Evan Thompson
