Assistant Professor- Position in South Asian Religions at McGill

I recently heard from Malcolm Keating, South Asia Book Review Editor for *Philosophy East & West.* He said they have the following books available to review. The journal can’t always promise complimentary hard copies, but free e-copies are certain. Please note that authors are welcome to have their publishers get in touch with the journal, too. For more information, contact Malcolm Keating at[malcolm.keating@yale-nus.edu.sg](mailto:malcolm.keating@yale-nus.edu.sg).
