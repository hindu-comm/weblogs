**Details**:  
The aim of this workshop is to explore the philosophical and logical aspects pertaining to religion coming from the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain perspectives. The participants will inquire into how the relations between logic and religion are supported by rational inquiry on religious matters. They will scrupulously examine a wide range of arguments postulated by Indian philosophers, logicians, and theologians. The main themes will center around: the doctrine of karma and the related concepts of suffering, accumulation of merits, and detachment, the belief in an afterlife, rebirth, and/or liberation, the main arguments for the existence and non-existence of a permanent self, and the disputes between the theists and atheists over the existence of the divine realm(s) and God.

-   We invite submissions of contributed papers on topics related to
    these questions, including but not restricted to: -   Philosophico-logical arguments for the possibility of liberation and
    reincarnation. -   Retributive dimension of the doctrine of karma. -   Logic and the concept of God, especially the arguments for and
    against the existence of God. -   Theism and Atheism in the Indian religious-philosophical traditions. -   Arguments for the existence and persistence of a self. -   Ethical implications of religious beliefs.

Paper proposals drawing upon original sources written in classical Indian languages (Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit) and papers with comparative and/or cross-cultural components are particularly welcome.
