Opening for a professor of “Indian Philosophy” at Oxford

This November, [Charles Goodman](https://www.binghamton.edu/philosophy/faculty/profile.html?id=cgoodman) and I had a wonderful debate at Princeton’s [Center for Culture, Society and Religion](https://csr.princeton.edu/), on the interpretation of Śāntideva’s ethics: Charles claims that Śāntideva is a utilitarian, I claim that he is a eudaimonist. You can now [watch the video of the debate](https://csr.princeton.edu/medialibrary/santideva-utilitarian-or-eudaimonist) on the Center’s website; I hope you enjoy!

Charles and I refer a lot in the debate to the handouts we created; I’m attaching them here.
