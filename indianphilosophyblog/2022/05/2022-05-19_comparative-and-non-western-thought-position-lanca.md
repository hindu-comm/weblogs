Mapping the territory: Sanskrit cosmopolis, 1500–today

The message below has been sent to us by Prof. Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad (thanks, Ram!).

Dear all,

We would particularly like to encourage women and ethnic minority candidates to apply. I would be happy for potential applicants to be in contact with me at c.ram-prasad@lancaster.ac.uk.  
Best wishes,  
Ram
