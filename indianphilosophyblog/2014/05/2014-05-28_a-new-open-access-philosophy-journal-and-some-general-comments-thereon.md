A new Open Access Philosophy Journal (and some general comments thereon)

Where should one publish? The question is less easy than it seems, given
that an ideal journal should be, in my opinion:

-   peer-reviewed (no one wants to write on a local and uninfluential
    venue)
-   Open Access (I want people to be allowed to read what I think I have
    to contribute)
-   pluralistic (I greatly admire those scholars of Indian philosophy
    who managed to write on one of the “Top-5” philosophical journals,
    but sometimes it seems to me that philosophers who are used to just
    internal discussions are just not enough interested to read about
    external challenges to their views)
-   not charging authors (I have recently paid \[an outrageous amount of
    money\] for an article of mine to be published OA on a Springer
    journals…  
    it is nice to know that it is not the only alternative).
-   allowing LateX files (I know, I am not among the majority in this
    regard, but I really hate converting my files and the only thing I
    hate more than that is having to work directly with Word)

Now, Franz [Huber](http://huber.blogs.chass.utoronto.ca) has recently
written to me to announce the launch the first issue of
[Ergo](http://www.ergophiljournal.org/). This is a philosophical journal
seemingly (hopefully: apparently) fulfilling all the criteria above and
with an additional impressive list of section editors, which seems to
suggest real openness and freshness of approach (by the way, it is nice
to see that it is not an all-men club).

Furthermore, in order to celebrate the first issue the general editors
(Franz Huber and Jonathan
[Weisberg](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~weisber3/) had a great idea of
organising a virtual round table by having the papers of the first issue
discussed by philosophers on various blogs:

-   Julia Jorati (OSU) discusses
    [here](http://philosophymodsquad.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/rozemonds-and-lodges-explorations-of-leibnizs-mill/)
    the paper in early modern by Paul Lodge (Oxford)
-   Anna Mahtani (LSE) discusses
    [here](http://m-phi.blogspot.ca/2014/05/michael-caies-calibration-and_27.html)
    the paper in probabilism by Michael Caie (Pittsburgh)
-   Ellen Clark (Oxford) discusses
    [here](http://philosomama.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/analogies-evolutionary-forces-and-shiny.html)
    the paper in philosophy of biology by  
    Christopher Hitchcock (Caltech) and Joel Velasco (Texas Tech)
-   Thomas Nadelhoffer (Charleston) discusses
    [here](http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/xphi/2014/05/john-turris-piece-in-the-first-issue-of-ergo.html)
    the paper in experimental philosophy by John Turri (Waterloo)

Personally, I hope that the experiment will be so succesfully that they
will chose to repeat it for the next issues.  
Now, for a topic more directly concerning our blog: **Would Ergo also
publish articles about Indian Philosophy? Yes\*** (which is great news,
and not just for scholars of Indian philosophy, but especially for the
others, who will benefit of this openness).

\*”We really mean it when we say that we welcome submissions on all
philosophical topics and from all philosophical traditions, including
non-Western philosophy. Our current board of editors is largely
reflecting the submissions we have received so far. We aim at not
assigning more than one paper per month on average to an editor, and we
have hired additional editors for those areas where we have received
more submissions than expected” (Franz Huber, personal communication)
