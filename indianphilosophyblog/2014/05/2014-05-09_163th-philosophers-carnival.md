163rd Philosophers’ Carnival

We are very happy to be hosting the Philosophers’ Carnival here for the
first time and hope that readers will not feel too much baffled by the
Indian philosophy milieu. Here is our selection of this month’s
philosophical blogs:

**Epistemology**

-   At
    [NewApps](http://http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/04/numerical-cognition-as-a-social-phenomenon.html),
    Catarina Dutilh Novaes speaks about a talk by Helen De Cruz
    concerning how much of our way to use numbers is a social
    phenomenon. Children who learn to use numbers, De Cruz and Dutilh
    Novaes argue, are doing it in the same way they learn by heart
    rhymes, and not like scientists discovering the world on their own
    —pure delight for the ears of someone who
    [thinks](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2013/05/linguistic-communication.html)
    that we need to learn from other people’s testimony even how to
    perceive.
-   Again at
    [NewApps](http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/04/on-evolutionary-biology-and-giving-religion-a-pass.html#more),
    Roberta L. Millstein discusses whether we need to tolerate, accept
    or just condemn religious beliefs as unwarranted epistemological
    assumptions. The comment section is perhaps even more interesting
    for people who are, like I am, intrigued by the epistemology of
    testimony (including religious beliefs based on testimony).
-   At [Aesthetics for
    birds](http://www.aestheticsforbirds.com/2014/04/are-there-objects-of-olfactory.html),
    Clare Batty discusses the epistemology of the objects of olfactory
    perception —with interesting outputs for our (primarily visual)
    concept of space.
-   At the [OUP
    blog](http://blog.oup.com/2014/04/inferring-the-unconfirmed-the-no-alternatives-argument/),
    Richard Dawid, Stephan Hartmann and Jan Sprenger discuss about the
    “no alternative” argument. Sherlock Holmes is obviously cited, but
    readers of this blog will probably think at the Indian discussion
    about this argument (called
    *[arthāpatti](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2012/03/validity-of-sacred-texts-other-than.html)*).

**Free will and personal identity  
**

It has been a great month for readers passionate about the issue of free
will:

-   Jayarava Attwood’s most recent
    [post](http://jayarava.blogspot.co.at/2014/04/experience-and-free-will-in-early.html)
    (on Jayarava’s raves) on *karman* focuses on free will. The comments
    further elaborate on the distinction between free will (which might
    be an illusion) and self-control (which is certainly real).
-   Alfred Mele is hosted by [Big
    Questions](https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/what-are-implications-free-will-debate-individuals-and-society)
    and discusses about the interaction of free will and neurosciences,
    in a way which relates to a post on [Flickers of
    Freedom](http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/flickers_of_freedom/2014/04/how-does-or-might-cognitive-science-threaten-free-will.html)
    (asking which neuroscientific evidence would threathen our belief in
    free will —be sure you read the comment section). An answer
    (seemingly unaware of the question) is given at [Practical
    Ethics](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/05/cognitive-science-and-threats-to-free-will/#more-8444)
    by Joshua Shephard.
-   On a related issue, Alexander Pruss dedicates
    [one](http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.co.at/2014/05/functional-characterizations-of-pain.html)
    of his many interesting posts of April, to pain and whether it has a
    function (wondering about the connection with free will? We do not
    withdraw a hand from a hot stove because of pain, but before pain).
-   Again loosely related is [David Papineau’s
    post](http://www.davidpapineau.co.uk/1/post/2014/04/the-importance-of-being-focused.html)
    on will and automatism in sport (does a cricket player have the time
    to decide what to do? —n some basic form, answers Papineau).

Concerning personal identity:

-   John Danaher at Philosophical Disquisitions has a very interesting
    series of posts (here is the
    [index](http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.ie/2014/04/thoughts-on-agars-truly-human.html))
    on Agar’s thesis that we need limitations to radical enhancement.
    Many interesting issues relating to human identity and the role
    memory plays in it are raised and discussed.
-   Eric Schwitzgebel at [The Splintered
    Mind](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.co.at/2014/04/how-to-be-part-of-gods-mind.html)
    discusses idealist pantheism (Eric will also host the next edition
    of the Carnival).

This last post leads nicely to the next section,

**Philosophy of religion**

-   At the
    [Prosblogion](http://prosblogion.ektopos.com/2014/04/24/hudson-on-skeptical-theism-and-divine-deception/),
    Kenny Pearce discusses the possibility of Divine deception. The post
    is interesting for its form (the discussion of a book-chapter —which
    however can be under understood also by the ones who have not read
    the book yet—) and for its content (how can a skeptical theist
    answer to the claim that she could be the victim of God’s
    deception?).

**Logic and Philosophy of Language**

-   At
    [Sprachlogik](http://sprachlogik.blogspot.co.at/2014/04/facts-and-granularity.html),
    Tristan Haze discusses about the interactions of concepts and their
    linguistic representation in a way which evokes Frege’s Morning Star
    and Kripke’s Pierre and adds a new case: A German Pieter \[Peter
    would have been better, by the way\] knows about Clark Kent and his
    identity with Übermensch \[again, the example is not perfect, since
    the name “Superman” is not translated into German\], and comes to
    know that also Superman is the same as Clark Kent (and,
    consequently, as Übermensch). The topic could lead also to further
    ontological consequences.
-   *Si parva licet…*, you can read my most recent posts on the
    linguistic theory of *apoha*
    [here](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/04/11/sucarita-misra-on-apoha-on-kataoka-2014a/),
    [here](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/04/18/who-invented-the-apoha-theory-on-kunjunni-raja-1986/)
    (be sure to read the interesting comments) and
    [here](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/04/24/is-vya%E1%B8%8Di-meant-when-jayanta-refers-to-exclusion/).

**Political Theory, Practical Ethics and Methodology**

-   At
    [NewApps](http://http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/04/a-bechdel-test-for-philosophy-papers.html),
    Helen De Cruz discusses what to do about the implicit biases which
    make us cite almost only papers written by men and suggests to
    consider adopting a Bechdel test.
-   At
    [Enviroethics](http://enviroethics.org/2014/04/22/blog-when-did-earth-day-get-so-lame/),
    William Grove-Fanning discusses about the decline of
    environmentalism and the fact that it (risks to) fail(s) to convey a
    positive vision of the future, one people can identify with and
    fight for. The need to be assertive, but not only reactive is a
    problem common to other movements, I would add. (The epistemological
    issue of climate-change denial is discussed by Roberta L. Millstein,
    [here](http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/04/if-fighting-climate-change-denial-is-like-fighting-creationism-how-do-we-do-it.html)).
-   At his new
    [blog](http://ralphwedgwood.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/against-ideal-theory.html),
    Ralph Wedgwood discusses the methodological problems related to the
    use of ideal theories, most of all in Political Philosophy (they
    generate confusion between the problem of the definition of an ideal
    standard and the problem of its actual realisation). Marcus Arvan
    answers on the [Philosophers’
    Cocoon](http://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/whats-not-wrong-with-ideal-theory.html)
    (suggesting that we need an ideal standard in order to understand
    what is feasible).

**History of Philosophy, Comparative Philosophy and why doing it**

-   Graham Priest discusses
    [here](http://blog.oup.com/2014/04/philosophy-history/?utm_content=bufferb51c9&utm_medium=)
    about the need to study the history of philosophy, since it is an
    endless mine of potentialities to be actualised (and refers also to
    Nagarjuna).
-   Tim Connolly at [Warp, Weft and
    Way](http://warpweftandway.com/2014/04/27/culturally-variant-intuitions/)
    discusses about whether there are culturally variant intuitions (a
    big problem for epistemology and for the methodological use of
    intuitions in philosophy, as well as for the importance of
    comparative philosophy).
-   On a related vein, Patrick S. O’Donnell at [Religious Left
    Law](http://www.religiousleftlaw.com/2014/04/act-naturally-say-what.html)
    discusses the paradox of “acting naturally”, which, like falling
    asleep, is something one cannot attain out of the wish to attain it.
    The whole post elaborates on Daoism and suggests that there is no
    longer “only one way to understand the world” (a good beginning for
    comparative enterprises!).
-   Our own Amod Lele at Love of All Wisdom explains in three post
    ([here](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/03/searching-for-ascent-and-descent-1/),
    [here](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/04/searching-for-ascent-and-descent-2/)
    and
    [here](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/04/defining-ascent-and-descent/))
    his attempt to categorise all possible philosophies.
-   Is is possible to discuss philosophically about authors whose ideas
    are partly or largely lost (from Aristotle to the Buddha)? Justin
    Whitaker and many commentators discuss the topic on this
    [blog](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/04/28/trusting-our-sources-manuscripts-archaeology-and-what-we-cannot-know/).

The next edition of the Carnival will be hosted at [The Splintered
Mind](http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.co.at/). Submissions are open
[here](http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.co.at/).
