Kumārila on sentence meaning

Who are the opponents in Kumārila’s *Ślokavārttika* (henceforth ŚV),
chapter on sentence-meaning? And did the ŚV set the standard for all
further discussions on the topic?

The ŚV vākya chapter deals with the PMS \[*Pūrva Mīmāṃsā Sūtra*\]
1.1.24, which focuses on the signification of sentences. The chapter is
thus prompted by the initial objection that although the innate meaning
of words has been secured (in PMS 1.1.5–23), this still does not entail
the validity of the Vedas, since these are made of sentences and
sentences are human compositions (ŚV vākya 1). Just like the Jayanta’s
*Nyāyamañjarī* (henceforth NM) 5, [section on sentence
meaning](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/04/24/is-vya%E1%B8%8Di-meant-when-jayanta-refers-to-exclusion/),
the section then opens with a short summary of the possible theories
concerning sentence and sentence meaning and then examines them in more
detail (ŚV vākya 2–3). It is noteworthy, however, that the positions
listed in NM 5, section on vākya, do not correspond to the ones
highlighted by Kumārila. The reasons for this differences could be of
key importance in order to understand how the debate about the
sentence-meaning had shifted in the time between Kumārila and Jayanta.
Kumārila mentions:

1.  The words communicate the sentence meaning one by one
2.  The words communicate the sentence meaning taken together
3.  There is a distinct linguistic element apart from the words (i.e.,
    the sphoṭa)
4.  The word meanings communicate the sentence meaning one by one
5.  The word meanings communicate the sentence meaning taken together
6.  The instruments of knowledge \[for the word meaning?\] communicate
    the sentence meaning
7.  The memories \[of the word meanings?\] communicate the sentence
    meaning one by one
8.  The memories \[of the word meanings?\] communicate the sentence
    meaning collectively
9.  The notions of a relation \[among word meanings\] communicate the
    sentence meaning one by one
10. The notions of a relation \[among word meanings\] communicate the
    sentence meaning collectively

Jayanta, instead, listed:

1.  ‘ The sentence-meaning is constituted by cognition, since no
    external sentence meaning is possible (attributed to *kecit*)
2.  ‘ The sentence meaning is an external state of affairs, constituted
    by the coordinated connection (*saṃsarga*) of word-meanings which
    correspond to external entities (attributed to *anye*)
3.  ‘ The sentence meaning is the exclusion of anything else (attributed
    to *apare*)
4.  ‘ The sentence meaning is an action, with the action factors
    subordinated to it, since no coordinated connection is possible
    (attributed to *apare*)
5.  ‘ The sentence meaning is the *arthabhāvanā* and, in the case of
    exhortative verbal endings, the *śabdabhāvanā* is also added as a
    sentence meaning (attributed to *anye*)
6.  ‘ Since it is cumbersome to postulate two different things to be
    denoted by the exhortative verbal endings, only the prescription is
    denoted by exhortative verbal endings (attributed to *apare*) —two
    sub theories are discussed
7.  ‘ The sentence meaning is the effort

Why are Jayanta’s and Kumārila’s list so different? Kumārila focuses on
which elements convey the sentence meaning, whereas Jayanta’s is a
semantic analysis, focusing on the nature of the sentence meaning. Once
this is established, it is interesting to see that the two lists still
have little overlappings:

1.  Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā (=K 5, J 5)
2.  Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā (=K 2, J 6)
3.  Vijñānavāda (=K 10, J 1)

Why so? **Had the linguistic fashion changed between Kumārila and
Jayanta? Or do they just focus on different things?
