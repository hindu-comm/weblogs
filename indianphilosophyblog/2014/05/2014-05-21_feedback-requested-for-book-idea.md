Feedback requested for book idea

Friends, [Anand Vaidya](http://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/) asked
me for feedback on a book proposal for readings in Indian philosophy. I
told him that perhaps the blog members could give their two cents and he
said that would be a good idea. So, what do you think about a proposal
like the following (everything is provisional, of course)?



Title: Arguments from classical Indian Philosophy

1\. Knowledge

2\. Self

3\. Agency

4\. Perception

6\. Inference

7\. Testimony

8\. Absence

Anand notes that “this would require good excerpts from the various
schools organized in a very tight manner. But still something really
basic where we have short selections and exchanges that students can
read. And something non-comprehensive. I don’t think they want a massive
reader.”

So, what he wants to know is (i) is there a need for such a volume,
targeting an undergraduate-level readership? (ii), any big-picture
suggestions for this sort of project? (iii) who may be inspired to work
with him on it?

Please post reflections on (i) and (ii) below. For (iii), you can write
him directly at dr.vaidya@gmail.com
