New Issue of Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy

Volume 13.1 of Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy is out. In what
is a very welcome development, the issue’s theme is “Critical Engagement
between Chinese and Indian Philosophies.”

There are a number of interesting papers. Among them:

the Ethics of Confucianism and the*Bhagavad Gītā”,* byGeoffrey Ashton

Names”, by Laurie L. Patton
