Doing research on free will in Indian Philosophy

As a scholar trained in Western Academia, one has at least three choices
while dealing with Sanskrit Philosophy:

1.  One can treat it as if it were Western philosophy and discuss, e.g.,
    of monotonic or non-monotonic logic in Nyāya,
2.  One can deal with it in its own terms, e.g., by describing the
    inner-Mīmāṃsā controversy about whether one has to study the Veda
    because of the prescription to study it or because of the
    prescription to teach it (since, in order for someone to teach,
    someone else must be learning from him),
3.  One can attempt a compromise, looking for how a certain topic is
    configured in Sanskrit philosophy.

In the case of the topic of free will, it is hard to avoid the third
approach. In fact, whereas the topic of free will is one of the major
Leitmotivs running throughout the whole history of Western Philosophy,
on a pair with ontological issues, it is not formulated as such in
Sanskrit philosophy (see Freschi in the volume edited by Dasti and
Bryant). Nonetheless, one can look for implicit treatments of it in
theological contexts and in in philosophy of action ones.

Veṅkaṭanātha (also known with the honorific title Vedānta Deśika,
traditional dates 1269–1370) is one of the most prolific and
multi-faceted personalities of Indian philosophy. He attempted to create
a philosophic system which should have broadened Rāmānuja’s
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta and make it into a more comprehensive
philosophical system. Due to its ambition of comprehensiveness, it is
legitimate to expect from Veṅkaṭanātha’s system that it deals also with
questions relating to the nature of action and of our contribution to
it, and, thus, ultimately with the issue of free will.

**What do we have at Veṅkaṭanātha’s background?**

On the one hand, Veṅkaṭanātha’s relation towards (Pūrva) Mīmāṃsā and
Vedānta (and other Indian philosophical systems), on the other his
relation with the Vaiṣṇava religious literature he considers
authoritative (Pāñcarātra, hymns of the Āḻvārs). Given the fact that
most researches on Indian philosophy focus on Sanskrit texts, one runs
the risk to neglect the latter component, which is predominant in
Veṅkaṭanātha’s non-Sanskrit production.

**The Mīmāṃsā background**  
The Mīmāṃsā school did not explicitly deal with the topic of free will.
Nonetheless, its theory of action presupposes that there are real agents
and that these can be held responsible for their actions. In this sense,
its concept of duty and of responsibility takes free will as
self-assumed.

**The Vaiṣṇava background**  
The Vaiṣṇava texts follow a different path, since many of them emphasise
the worthlessness of the poet (the Āḻvār) or of his poetical figura
(often a woman) and his/her desperate need of God’s mercy, which is the
only thing which could save him/her. Interestingly enough, even in these
texts, free will is not denied, but rather superseded by God’s
intervention. The protagonist is desperate because of her/his *sins* and
states that s/he cannot achieve anything on his/her own. The possibility
to achieve salvation through other ways (most notably, through the
*bhaktimārga*, which is based on one’s love for God) is not ruled out.
One could theoretically be able to love God and to be saved through
that. *De facto*, however, the protagonists of the Āḻvārs’ hymns feel
unable even to do that. Even their love is not perfect, only their
surrender is.

**Thus, free will seems to remain a pre-condition. But God’s grace can
supersede it and save even unworthy ones. Or do Tamil-conversant readers
have a better appreciation of what is at stake?**
