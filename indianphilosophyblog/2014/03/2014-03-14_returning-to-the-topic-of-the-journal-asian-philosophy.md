Returning to the topic of the journal Asian Philosophy

Someone had raised some questions on an earlier post about the journal
Asian Philosophy. Does Asian Philosophy subject papers to blind review?
I have seen a lot of good articles in Asian Philosophy over the past two
years, but this does not mean they are vetted properly. I have also seen
articles there that were rather weak, and ignored much of the current
literature on their topics. As a way of figuring this out, please
respond to the questions below, if relevant:

1\. Have you gotten comments on a paper submitted to Asian Philosophy in
the past two years?

2\. Have you gotten anything other than an acceptance from Asian
Philosophy in the past two years?

3\. Have you been asked to review a paper for Asian Philosophy in the
past two years?

Thanks for any help. Anonymous posts are of course welcome, with valid
email.
