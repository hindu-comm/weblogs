Philosophers’ Carnival

Tristan Haze (the organiser of the [Philosophers’
Carnival](http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.co.at/)) just informed me
that we will host the May edition (the one to be posted around the 10th
of May and covering approximately the time 10th of April–10th of May). A
specific call for papers will be published here at the beginnning of
April.
