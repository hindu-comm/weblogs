CFP:  Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Dear Fellow Scholars of Indian Philosophy

I would like to draw your attention to the [Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/) (IEP). The IEP is a peer-reviewed
online publication. I am the editor for its Indian Philosophy content.
Many of the contributors to this blog have contributed articles to the
Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Some examples include Doug Berger’s
article on [Nāgārjuna,](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nagarjun/) Andrew
Nicholson’s article on [Bhedābheda](http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/) ,
Amod Lele’s article on [Śāntideva](http://www.iep.utm.edu/santideva/),
and Matthew Dasti’s article on [Nyāya](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/).

If you are a scholar of Indian philosophy (ABD or with a PhD in
philosophy or some related discipline) please consider contributing to
the IEP. It is a great place to publish on the aspect of Indian
philosophy that is your expertise. The IEP gets 500,000 hits a month.
Your work will be read!

Any topic in Indian philosophy that we have no article on is fair game.
We have a few restrictions. These include: (a) authors must be
proficient in writing in English at a scholarly level, and (b)
contributors must have an advanced degree in Philosophy or related
disciplines or be ABD in such disciplines.

For a description of its scholarly standards, please see:
