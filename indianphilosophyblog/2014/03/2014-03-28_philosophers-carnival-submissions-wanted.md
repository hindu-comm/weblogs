Philosophers’ Carnival, submissions wanted

The Philosophers’
[Carnival](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/03/03/philosophers-carnival/ "Philosophers’ Carnival")
is a monthly summary of the best philosophical papers which appeared on
the web in the preceding month. It is not hosted by a single site, but
rather, by various philosophically-oriented sites. Our blog has been
selected to host the Carnival at the beginning of May. Proposals (of
either one’s own posts, or other people’s ones) can be submitted
[here](http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.co.at/). Given the specific
focus of this blog, we would encourage you to submit also non-standard
blogposts, i.e.,

1.  blogposts focusing on comparative philosophy, comparative theology
    or on the methodology of comparatism
2.  blogposts focusing on issues usually neglected in standard Western
    philosophy
3.  blogposts focusing on less-common issues which are however dear to
    the authors of this blog (epistemology of testimony, environmental
    ethics, moral status of non-human beings, Asian philosophy,
    cross-influences of language and philosophy…)

And:

-   posts about Indian philosophy

The April edition of the Carnival will be published
[here](http://www.aestheticsforbirds.com/), around April the 10th. If
unfamiliar with the Carnival, glancing at it may help give you a sense
of how it functions. You are still on time to submit also for that one!
