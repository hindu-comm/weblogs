Need some information: graduate students and Hindu Theology/Phil Religion

Friends, Iâ€™ve been asked to see if there are any graduate students who
work in Indian Philosophy of religion, particularly of a broadly
theistic sort, and/or philosophical theology, who are competent to talk
with analytic philosophers of religion and share with them the best of
the Indic theological traditions. Could anybody who has some leads/names
communicate with me offline? Many thanks.
