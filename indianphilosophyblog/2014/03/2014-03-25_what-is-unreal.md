What is unreal?

The term *tuccha* means in Classical Sanksrit “worthless”,
“insignificant”. In Vedānta, however, it gets a more specific technical
meaning, to denote the absolute unreality of chimeral entities, such as
the *khapuṣpa* (flower in the air), which will not and cannot ever
exist.

For instance,

> *api ca saṃvit siddhyati vā na vā? siddhyati cet, sadharmatā syāt. na
> cet, tucchatā, gaganakusumādivat* (*Śrī Bhāṣya, mahāpūrvapakṣa*).
>
> Moreover, is consciousness established or not? If it is established,
> then it must have qualities. If not, it is unreal, like a flower in
> the sky.

Or:

> *api ca – avidyayā brahmaṇi tirohite tad brahma na kiñcid api
> prakāśate; uta kiñcit prakāśate? pūrvasmin kalpe,
> prakāśamātrasvarūpasya brahmaṇo ’prakāśe tucchatāpattir asakṛd uktā*
> (*Śrī Bhāṣya, mahāsiddhānta*).
>
> Moreover, if the brahman is covered by nescience, would it not shine
> at all or shine a little bit? In the first case, if the brahman, which
> is essentially nothing but light, would not shine, it would end up

In this sense, *tuccha* seems to have been added to Kumārila’s list of
four kinds of absence (previous absence, posterior absence, reciprocal
absence and absolute absence). But what is then the difference between
*tuccha* and the fourth type of absence, i.e., *atyantābhāva*?
Notwithstanding Kumārila’s initial understanding of it (as reconstructed
by Birgit Kellner, Kellner 1996 available for download
[here](http://www.birgitkellner.org/index.php?id=132)) the latter has
ended up covering cases of complete absence which however did not imply
a logical impossibility. *tuccha*, by contrast, covered logical and
conceptual impossibilities.

However, *tuccha* and *abhāva* (which, if not further specified, means
*atyantābhāva*) are found side by side in an odd passage of
Veṅkaṭanātha’s *Seśvaramīmāṃsā*. The passage attacks the Pramāṇavāda
idea that invalidity is intrinsic to cognitions, because, being a sheer
absence, it does not need to be created, it is the “by default”
situation. This cannot be the case, rebucks Veṅkaṭanātha.

Now, in this case, the idea that *prāmāṇya* is said to be *tuccha* in
something which is not an instrument of knowledge makes me think that
*tuccha* cannot mean “conceptually impossible” and that it must rather
mean just “absolutely absent”. Validity is in fact not conceptually
impossible, but just altogether absent from an invalid cognition. Even
the definition which follows seems to support this view, since a genuine
*tuccha* cannot have something existent as its counter positive. But
what is then *abhāva* in the same passage? All that Veṅkaṭanātha has to
say about it is that its *abhāvatva* is contradicted by the fact that
invalidity can be eliminated. And something non-existing should not be
liable to be eliminated. *abhāva* might then mean any sort of “absence”
and even “conceptually impossible” (but this would be really odd).

**Can *abhāva* in Vedāntic texts refer to something different than
*atyantābhāva*?**
