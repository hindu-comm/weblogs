One God, one Śāstra — A panel for the WSC 2015

**One God, one *śāstra*: philosophical developments towards and within
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta between Nāthamuni and Veṅkaṭanātha**

In the case of the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta school, one has the advantage
of having some basic historical elements to judge about the development
of the theological and philosophical thought of the school. We have, in
fact, at least some historical data about the time, place and
personality of key figures such as Yāmuna, Rāmānuja and Veṅkaṭanātha and
a good amount of works from them has survived and can be accessed. Some
attempts have been made (e.g., by Oberhammer, Neevel, Mesquita) to offer
a general interpretation of this early development, but many problems
have remained open, and not only because of the lack of materials
(regarding, e.g., Śrīvatsaṅka Miśra, Nāthamuni, important parts of
Yāmuna’s work, etc.).  
This panels aims at joining scholars working on the early Viśiṣṭādvaita
Vedānta, and making them discuss the development of Viśiṣṭādvaita
Vedānta from its forerunners to a full-fledged philosophical and
theological phenomenon. Possible leit-motivs in the analysis of this
development can be topics such as (the list does not aim to be
exhaustive):

-   the increasing importance of the topic of *aikaśāstrya*, possibly
    paralleling the emphasis on the existence of just one God
-   the adaptation of other schools to one’s theistic approach (from
    Nyāya and Yoga in the case of Nāthamuni to Uttara Mīmāṃsā in the
    case of Rāmānuja, to Pūrva Mīmāṃsā and again Nyāya for Veṅkaṭanātha)
