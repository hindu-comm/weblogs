Third and forth day at the IABS: “Pramana Across Asia”: Introduction to the panel, Katsura, Lusthaus UPDATED

The “Pramana across Asia” panel has been opened by Eli Franco, its
convener, with the following hope: “In some years, through stimuli such
as this panel, we will speak of Indo-Sinic Buddhism, just like we speak
of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism”.

-   In fact, the first speaker, Shoryu Katsura, has focused on the
    *Fangbianxinlun*, attributed to Nagarjuna.  
    The *Fangbianxinlun* (together with a text attributed to Vasubandhu)
    has been one of the two only texts on logic until Xuanzang
    introduced Dignaga’s New Buddhist Logic.

    The *Fangbianxinlun* is the Chinese translation of a no longer
    extant text whose title has been rendered as \*Upayahrdaya (Tucci)
    or \*Prayogasara (Frauwallner). After proposing a third alternative,
    namey \*Prayogahrdaya, Katsura has shown that the first Chinese
    character is used only twice in the text itself, once with the
    meaning of *upaya* and the second time with the meaning of *prayoga*
    ‘formal representation of a syllogism’, so that we have no way to
    settle the issue. As for the authorship, due to the usage of
    dilemmas and *prasanga*-argumentation, Katsura agrees with the
    attribution to Nagarjuna or to his school.  
    At the very beginning of the text, an objector states that people
    engage in debate because they are motivated by arrogance and hatred,
    so that it is better to avoid debates altogether. The author
    justifies himself by saying that he is only explaining the rules of
    debate because he needs to protect the truth of the Buddha’s
    teaching (cf. the similar arguments about *jati* and *vitanda*,
    which should have the same protective function, in the Nyāyasūtra),
    and not out of personal pride.

    As for its significance for the purpose of reconstructing the
    history of Indian philosophy, the *Fangbianxinlun* (henceforth \*UH)
    encompasses 8 topics, which remind one of the 8 *sadhana*s in the
    Hetuvidya section of the *Yogacarabhumi*. There are also
    correspondences with the 44 elements of debate mentioned in the
    *Carakasamhita*. The \*UH recognises 4 *pramana*s (*pratyaksa*,
    *anumana* —said to be *purvavat*, *sesavat* and *samanyatodrsta*—
    *sabda/aptagama* and *upamana*). In a list of schools, Buddhist and
    non-Buddhist schools are mentioned, and among the latter are
    Vaisesikas and Jains. Katsura has suggested that the omission of
    Nyaya might mean that the text predates the *Nyayasutra*.  
    In this regard, Birgit Kellner has suggested that the absence of the
    *Nyayasūtra* does not mean that there was no Nyaya school. According
    to Franco, the final redation of the NS occurred short before
    Vātsyāyana, in the first half of the 5th c. UPDATE: Please read
    Birgit’s comment below for a more precise version of what she said
    (I had not understood that she thinks that portions of the
    *Nyāyasūtra* might have existed even before the self-awareness of
    its author(s) and followers to be a distinct school).

    Long story short, Katsura’s talk nicely served the panel’s purpose
    of creating a common field of Indo-Sinic Buddhist studies.

-   The same applies to Dan Lusthaus’ talk (on Friday morning), which
    was dedicated to the Chinese versions of Dharmapāla’s commentary on
    the *Ālambanaparīkṣā*, and to the general topic of the presence of a
    Hetuvidyā tradition in China which is independent of Dharmakīrti
    (“as if there were a tradition of Greek Philosophy influenced by
    Plato but which has never known Aristotle”, Franco summarised).

**Are times ripe for “Indo-Sinic Buddhism”? What are we expecting from
this field of study?**
