Fifth day at the IABS: “Buddhism and Philosophy of Mind” panel

Saturday, I went to the panel on Buddhism and Philosophy of Mind, which
was announced as involving “our” Christian Coseru, Mark Siderits and
Jonardon Ganeri. In fact, Ganeri could not make it (“obviously he did
not feel fit for the match” commented Coseru at the beginning, among
general laughter), but this had the beneficial consequence that there
was a whole slot free for discussion.  
Given that discussions are the ingredient I most enjoy at conferences
and that at the IABS there was usually not enough institutional time for
them (although many interesting discussions took place, as usual, during
the breaks), I cannot but appreciate their extemporaneous decision.

Siderits talked about what Indian scholars call *svaprakāśa*– and
*paraprakāśavāda*, equating them with reflexivism and not reflexivism.
These answer the problem of how are cognitions cognised. According to
Nyāya, they are cognised through a higher order perception (henceforth
HOP), which they call *anuvyavasāya*, so that for each cognition a
cognition of it is possible:

> M (object: blue)  
> M\* (object: M)

Please note that this possibility does not imply that for each cognition
there *needs* to be a cognition of it.  
By contrast, Pramāṇavādins from Dignāga onwards, uphold that cognitions
are reflexive. Coseru went into further details about what this means
and stressed the fact that this reflexivity (or *svasaṃvedana*) cannot
be a *further* condition. Rather, it can only be an aspect of the same
cognition of a given object.  
While Coseru played the role of the supporter of the reflexivity view,
Siderits showed some of the possible objections to it. One of them goes
back to Nāgārjuna itself (although I have to admit that I could not tell
where he discusses it), namely that there are no reflexive acts
throughout the world. The reflexivity of cognitions would be an absolute
unicum. Now, if you have read some Indian epistemology, you will
immediately think of a counter-example, namely the light, which can
illuminate itself while illuminating other things. But the example does
not hold, Siderits-Nāgārjuna explained, since the light is not something
which can, *stricto sensu*, be illuminated, since in order to be
illuminated an object needs to be able to exist also in the darkness,
which is not the case with the light.  
A further objection is contained in a syllogism by the Mīmāṃsaka
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (7th c. ca.):

> One does not cognise one’s cognition, because it is a cognition, like
> Maitra

(Maitra is a proper name used to mean “a certain person”). The point
here is, in Siderits’ interpretation, that we have seemingly two
different ways to know about consciousness. In the case of ourselves, we
come to know that we are conscious through a simple act of introspection
(which is, let me add, an undeniable token of an **intrinsically valid
cognition**, since it is inimaginable to think that one could be wrong
in ascribing consciousness to oneself). But introspection cannot work in
the case of other people’s consciousness. We can only infer that other
people are conscious by observing their behaviour, most notably their
bodily movements.  
So, it seems that we have to do with two widely different concepts, and
that consciousness must have two different meanings, and, thus, be two
different things. This brings us to either solipsism (which is in fact
embraced by later Pramāṇavādins) or to the view that cognitions are not
directly cognised.  
Last, Siderits pointed to the fact that the non-reflexive theory
harmonises with some findings in cognitive sciences, namely that there
is a high-road and a low-road system in our brain. The latter does not
need one to be aware of what it cognises. For instance, if one throws us
a stone, we will bend on the opposite side immediately, *before being
aware of the stone.*

I have been working on Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā and am thus biased in favour of
non-reflexivism, but I wonder: **Reflexivism is needed within the
Buddhist framework, where there is no central *ātman* who can treasure
past cognitions and make memory, etc. possible. But why preferring this
option if one does not need to accept momentariness and the non-self
theory?**
