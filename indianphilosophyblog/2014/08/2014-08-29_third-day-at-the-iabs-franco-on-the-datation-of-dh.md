(Third day at the IABS:) Franco on the datation of Dharmakīrti and some further thoughts on Dharmakīrti, Dignāga, Kumārila

The datation of Dharmakīrti is a topic I am not competent enough to
speak about, but I will nonetheless try to summarise other people’s
arguments.  
The departing point is the traditionally accepted date of Dharmakīrti,
namely 600–660, settled by Erich Frauwallner mainly on the basis of the
reports of Chinese pilgrims, and especially on the fact that Xuanzang
did not mention Dharmakīrti. Recently, Helmut Krasser suggested to
reconsider the evidences. Xuanzang’s silence, he meant, is not an
evidence at all, since it might have well been the case that Dharmakīrti
was deliberately ignored in the curricula at Nalanda because of his
critical attitude towards the Buddha’s word (which is not in itself an
instrument of knowledge according to Dharmakīrti) and that this is the
only reason why Xuanzang did not hear about him. As for the *pars
construens*, Krasser suggests that Dharmakīrti must have influenced
Bhāviveka (and not the other way round) and that this influence is
recognizable in several topics, e.g., in the increased importance of the
topic of omniscience and in the so-called *sattvānumāna*. Thus,
Dharmakīrti must have lived well before the commonly acknowledged date.

During Vincent Eltschinger’s Habilitation’s Defence and now at the IABS
the topic has been resumed by Eli Franco (Birgit Kellner, Patrick
McAllister, Ernst Steinkellner and others have also taken part to the
discussion). Franco’s *pars destruens* regarded the fact that one finds
evidences of the Buddha’s omniscience as a distinct philosophical topic
already in the Spitzer Manuscript and that the topic has, thus, not been
introduced by Dharmakīrti in the Indian debate. As for the
*sattvānumāna*, Franco contends that its formulation by Dharmakīrti and
by Bhāviveka is completeley different and that the only common element,
namely *sattva* as a *probans* is already found in Uddyotakara.
McAllister has suggested during the discussion and “on behalf of Helmut”
that the inferences are not that different. They are applied to a
different locus (*pakṣa*), but their *probans* (namely, *anityatva* in
Bhāviveka and *kṣaṇikatva* in Dharmakīrti) could be the same. In fact,
after Dharmakīrti *anityatva* is considered to be the same as
*kṣaṇikatva*, so that if Bhāviveka lived before Dharmakīrti, the
inferences would be different, whereas if he lived after him, they would
be equivalent.  
Long story short, according to Franco, the similarities between
Bhaviveka and Dharmakīrti are far too vague and general: they could have
been “ideas in the air”, rather than precise references. And even if
there were direct correspondences, there can still have been a third
source. **We cannot assume that what we have was actually all that there
was.** In this connection, Birgit Kellner has pointed out the fact that
there is no reason to believe that what we have is all that was
circulating at that time. If I (EF) am allowed to step in, this is in my
opinion an important thing to be kept in mind while looking for the
source of an innovative element in an author’s thought (as
paradigmatically done by Erich Frauwallner in his attempt to reconstruct
the history of Indian philospohy). An example is the case of the
development of Kumārila’s thought from *vyāpti* to *niyama* discussed
[here](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/08/25/k-yoshimizu-on-valid-inferences-in-kumarila-and-on-the-chronology-of-kumarila-and-dharmakirti/ "K. Yoshimizu on valid inferences in Kumārila (and on the chronology of Kumārila and Dharmakīrti)"),
but the general point regards the fact that **while looking for a
source, we are left with far too few candidates**.

As for the *pars construens* of his argument, Franco stressed the
silence by Xuanzang, that by Candrakīrti and then silence of Jain
authors. The first Jain who refers to Dharmakīrti is in fact Akalaṅka
(720–780). All of that has been explained by Krasser as the result of
the suppression of Dharmakīrti’s thought from the curricula at Nalanda.
But, Franco noticed, we have no evidence neither of this suppression,
nor of the later rediscovery of Dharmakīrti in Nalanda. Ernst
Steinkellner observed in this connection that curricula are, even
nowadays, slow to be updated and Dharmakīrti’s thought was very complex.
It might thus be that he could find his place in the curricula only
after a generation of commentaries which had clarified his innovations
(incidentally, this “softer” explanation is not what Krasser had thought
and claimed to have been the case).

A last point: Moving Dharmakīrti back would have a great impact on the
chronology of Indian philosophy. For instance, we now know more or less
for sure that Dharmakīrti influenced Kumārila, who was influenced by
Dignāga. Establishing *independently* Kumārila’s date would thus lead
one to important conclusions regarding Dharmakīrti’s date, too (and vice
versa).

Full disclosure: I might be implicitly biased in favour of Helmut
[Krasser](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/04/01/helmut-krasser-the-rebel-sanskritist/ "Helmut Krasser, the Rebel Sanskritist —UPDATED"),
because he was a friend, my former boss and because he is no longer
there to defend himself. (cross-posted at my personal
