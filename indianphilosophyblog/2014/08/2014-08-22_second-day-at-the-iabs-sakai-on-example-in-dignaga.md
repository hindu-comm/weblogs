Second day at the IABS: Sakai on example in Dignaga, Dharmakirti and Arcata

Yesterday I missed all talks taking place during my panel, but today I
could reconver at least one of them, since its author gave me the full
text of the talk.

-   Masamichi Sakai discussed the role and fortune of **examples** in
    Dignaga, Dharmakirti, Arcata and his successors. The example is
    essential to show the *vyapti* for Dignaga, but risks to become in
    fact unessential for Dharmakirti, who thinks to be able to ground
    the *vyapti* ontologically. Arcata pushes this risk further, insofar
    as he admits that in the case of the *sattvanumana*, namely the
    inference through which one infers that everything that exists is
    momentary, an example is in fact only fictitious (*kalpanika*). For,
    the *paksa* is just everything, since everything is momentary, so
    that one only artificially separates the *paksa* from the *sapaksa*.
    Ratnakirti, who dealt with the same problem had in fact to admit
    that the process through which one gets at the example leads in fact
    already to the same result as the *sattvanumana* (so that either the
    one or the other ends up being redundant).

**It has been argued that examples are an evidence of the inductive
nature of Indian inference. Does this apply to Pramanavada as well? Or
did Dharmakirti change it all?**
