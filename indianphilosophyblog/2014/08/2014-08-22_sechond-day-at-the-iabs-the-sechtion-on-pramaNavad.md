Second day at the IABS: The Section on Pramāṇavāda

I am not completely convinced by the reasons behind the partition in
panels and sections here, nonetheless, I heard two interesting papers
readers might also find intriguing:

-   Alex Watson delivered a talk which could have perhaps be a better
    fit for the panel on Buddhism and Philosophy of Mind, since it
    focused on **attention**. Alex derived his topic and its sub-topics
    from discussions within contemporary philosophy of mind and tried to
    move them to India. He noted that the Sāṅkhya school presupposes a
    fully detached *ātman*, so that shifts of attention are only
    explained through *saṃskāra*s. By contrast, according to Nyāya the
    *ātman* can decide to point the *manas* to one or the other sense
    and thus focus its attention to one or the other object. Shifts of
    attention are also conscious decisions. Finally, the
    Abhidharma-Pramāṇavāda view is that some shifts of attention are due
    to *saṃskāra*s, whereas other shifts (or continuities of attention,
    I guess) are due to the impulse taken by the previous moment of
    awareness. In this sense, the Buddhist view is mid-way among the
    two, but it differs from both insofar as it does not assume an
    *ātman* at all and just refutes any “ghost in the machine” (the
    image is Alex’) and prefers to have “just the machine”. The
    Naiyāyika perspective is at odds, Alex observed, in many cases, for
    instance when it comes to justify why we have so many problems
    focusing our attention on a topic. The Buddhist view is much more
    satisfactory insofar as it just assumes that among the possible
    objects we can direct our attention to, the “winner” is just the
    most powerful one.  
    However, I wonder how I could focus my attention on Alex’ talk for
    its whole length, given that there were many attractive people in
    the room… It is hard not to imagine that some central ruler decided
    to ignore them.
-   In this connection, Viktorya Lysenko aptly noted that one should be
    aware that *manas* cannot be translated as ‘mind’, since it is
    unconscious.
-   Toshikazu Watanabe discussed the relation of Bhāviveka, Dharmapāla
    and Dharmakīrti, dealing, among other things, also with the
    *sattvānumāna*. His conclusion was that the relationship between
    Bhāviveka and Dharmakīrti is very close and that he would thus
    suggest to push Dharmakīrti’s date back of some decades, in order to
    connect him more closely to his predecessor Bhāviveka.

**How do you introspectically think attention might work?** (Further
comments are also always invited.)
