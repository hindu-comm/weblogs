Daya Krishna’s “Creative Encounters with Texts”

Daya Krishna was an Indian philosopher, a rationalist and iconoclast,
who constantly tried to question and scrutinise acquired “truths”. The
main place for such investigations was for him a *saṃvāda* ‘dialogue’.
That’s why he also strived to organise structured *saṃvāda* inviting
scholars from different traditions to debate about a specific problem.
The minutes of such dialogues have been published in
*[Saṃvāda](http://www.amazon.com/Samvada-Dialogue-Between-Philosophical-Traditions/dp/8120807987/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416213778&sr=8-1&keywords=Daya+Krishna+Samvada)*
and *[Bhakti](http://philpapers.org/rec/KRIBAC)*.

Shail Mayaram, in the introduction of a book dedicated to Daya Krisna
and Ramchandra Gandhi, *[Philosophy as Samvad and
Svaraj](http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Samvad-Svaraj-Dialogical-Meditations/dp/8132111214/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416213727&sr=8-1&keywords=Daya+Krishna+Sa%E1%B9%83v%C4%81da)*
adds some interesting information about the *saṃvāda*s which have no
written record:

> A dialogue on bhakti attempted to universalize the phenomenon of
> devotion and encourage thinking about it philosophically. A dialogue
> on Śilpaśāstra was held in Amber, Jaipur and brought together
> traditional *sthapati*s and architects. I \[…\] was fortunate to be
> present at the dialogue on Kāshmir \[sic!\] Śaivism (with a special
> session in an open ground in Gulmarg). \[…\] Subsequently, two
> dialogues were held in Lucknow and Hydearabad.

Within the same volume, Mustafa Khawaja reproduces the letter of
invitation sent by Daya Krishna to scholars of Islamic philosophy. Daya
Krishna predominantely wrote in English, but he was well aware of the
risk of neglecting other languages. Thus, the *saṃvāda*s were open to
scholars speaking in different languages (as attested also by the
proceedings mentioned above) and Daya Krishna was very keen to listen
also to marginal philosophical traditions (such as that of the Islamic
theologians speaking Urdū). Also the invitation letter is written in two
languages and is full of open questions to be debated.  
Nonetheless, this openness did not always work. Mayaram writes:

> I remember the meeting of the scholars’ group including Daya Krishna,

This is an interesting point, because **dialogue cannot be imposed on
someone, its very “democratic” structure makes this impossible**. Thus,
**what to do with those who do not want to speak? Or is dialogue among
people not sharing the same presuppositions** (e.g., the same religious
praxis) **impossible?**
