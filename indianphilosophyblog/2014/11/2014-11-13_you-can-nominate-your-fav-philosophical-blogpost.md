You can nominate your favourite philosophical blogpost

â€¦of the last year (that is, written after November the 9th 2013)
[here](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2014/11/huw-price-to-judge-5th-annual-3qd-philosophy-prize.html),
**before November the 17th**.

Unfortunately, only the 100 most voted posts will be evaluated. It would
be nice if a post dealing with non-Western philosophy could be at least
nominated among those 100!
