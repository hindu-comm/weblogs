Stephen Harris on Suffering and Buddhist Ethics

I just found out through Philpapers about a forthcoming article by “our”
Stephen Harris, who perhaps might want to elaborate a little bit more
about it here?

The title is: *Suffering and the Shape of Well-Being in Buddhist Ethics*
and it has been already published on line (under a paywall) on [Asian
Philosophy](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09552367.2014.952931#preview).

The following one is the abstract:

> This article explores the defense Indian Buddhist texts make in
> support of their conceptions of lives that are good for an individual.
> This defense occurs, largely, through their analysis of ordinary
> experience as being saturated by subtle forms of suffering (*duḥkha*).
> I begin by explicating the most influential of the Buddhist taxonomies
> of suffering: the threefold division into explicit suffering
> (*duḥkha-duḥkhatā*), the suffering of change (*vipariṇāma-duḥkhatā*),
> and conditioned suffering (*saṃskāra-duḥkhatā*). Next, I sketch the
> three theories of welfare that have been most influential in
> contemporary ethical theory. I then argue that Buddhist texts
> underdetermine which of these theories would have been accepted by
> ancient Indian Buddhists. Nevertheless, Buddhist ideas about suffering
> narrow the shape any acceptable theory of welfare may take. In my
> conclusion, I argue that this narrowing process itself is enough to
> reconstruct a philosophical defense of the forms of life endorsed in
> Buddhist texts.

In sum, it looks like a stimulating article, both because of its content
(the thought-provoking idea that a “good life” might be a life in which
one has abandoned everything, including family and friends) and because
of the cross-cultural enterprise it attempts. Chapeau!
