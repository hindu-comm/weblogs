The 169th Philosophers’ Carnival

The [169th Philosophers’
Carnival](http://w5800.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/philosophers-carnival-169/)
is online! Among several other interesting things, it has some lines on
the [interpretation of an alien
Philosophy](http://warpweftandway.com/interpreting-philosophy-works/)
and on the
[Skholiast](http://speculumcriticum.blogspot.co.at/2014/10/cosmopolitan-philosophy-in-polycentric.html)‘s
contribution to the “doing philosophy in a polycentric world” debate
(about which see also
[this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/24/towards-an-institute-for-cosmopolitan-philosophy/)
post on the Indian Philosophy Blog).

For personal reasons, I am also happy to see also a link to Gabriele
Contessa’s
[plea](http://yetanotherphilosophersblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/analytic-philosophy-and-english.html)
for a more inclusive policy of inclusion of philosophers who do not have
English as their first language. Why should this be important? Apart
from the fact that it is
[fair](http://yetanotherphilosophersblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/is-linguistic-bias-unfair-or-just.html)
to include everyone, independent of their (race, gender, sexual
preferences… and) native tongue, inclusion of different perspectives is
part of the enterprise of ideodiversity, which is what we (=scholars of
non-Western philosophies) are all engaged with, isn’t it?
