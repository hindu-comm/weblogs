Anand Venkatkrishnan on Vedānta, bhakti and Mīmāṃsā through the history of the family of Āpadeva and Anantadeva in 16th–17th c. Banaras

When, where and how did *bhakti* become acceptable within the Indian
intellectual élites?

A Sanskritist-historian, Anand
[Venkatkrishnan](https://columbia.academia.edu/AnandVenkatkrishnan),
opened his research on the family of Āpadeva in 16th–17th c. Banaras to
this wider issue in a recent article published on *South Asian History
and Culture*\*. The backbone of the article is Anand’s research on the
production of the intellectuals belonging to the “Deva” family, several
of which have been intensely prolific and have even played an important
role in the Sanskrit intellectual history. Anand seems to read Sanskrit
well and with pleasure, given that he freely travels through genres in
order to reconstruct an intellectual flair rather than splitting hairs
on specific doctrinal problems. Even more valuable is the fact that he
broadens the scope of his research to also Marathi texts —the Deva
family moved to Banaras from Mahārāṣṭra. Of particular interest in this
connection is a genealogical reconstruction by Anantadeva II (“fl. 1650
CE”), where he speaks of the glory of his family starting with

> \[…\] vedavedīsamanvitaḥ \|  
> śrīkṛṣṇabhaktimān eka ekanāthābhidho dvijaḥ \|\|
>
> A brahmin, fully endowed with Vedic knowledge,  
> A devotee of Krishna: Ekanātha by name. (p. 150)

This Ekanātha should be identified, maintains Anand (against Keune and
Edgerton and with Pollock, O’Hanlon and Kane) with the Marathi
poet-saint Eknāth (latter halfth of the 16th c.) and this throws light
on the interesting mix of *bhakti* and scholarship in the Deva family.
The article was perhaps too short to allow Anand to dwell deeper in the
issue and discuss, e.g., the frequence of the name Ekanātha in
Mahārāṣṭra —one might imagine that many people might have been named
after the saint Eknāth— or the reasons for a short mention of such an
illustrious predecessor in Anantadeva II’s genealogical reconstruction,
as if he were nothing more than a normal devotee. Nonetheless, it
remains clear that the family linked an intellectual profile with a
*bhakti* commitment. This mixture is prominent in Anantadeva, who wrote
a drama, the *Kriṣṇabhakticandrikānāṭaka*, in which a Mīmāṃsaka and a
Vedāntin discuss and are last converted by a devotee of Kṛṣna. Of
particular interest to me is the fact that at times the Mīmāṃsaka seems
to be an ally of the devotee:

> buddhiṃ parasya bhettuṃ kevalam etad hi pāṇḍityam \|\| 93 \|\|

Which I would translate plainly as an attack of the Vedāntin as if he
were no more than an eristic Buddhist:

> In fact, \[your\] scholarship only consists in this: You destroy the
> ideas of your opponent \[without establishing anything on your own\]!

Anand’s translation is slightly different in its first part (honestly, I
can not understand the English form of his first clause, that’s why I
offered a different translation):

> Some scholarship that is: you only *de*construct the ideas of others.
> (p. 152)

The alliance of Mīmāṃsā and devotion against the Advaita Vedānta
approach might be a direction worth exploring further. Anand also hints
at the prehistory of this alliance, mentioning a verse of Kumārila’s
*Bṛhaṭṭīkā* quoted by Anantadeva II:

> nanu niḥśreyasaṃ jñānād bandhahetor na karmanaḥ \|  
> naikasmād api tat kiṃ tu jñānakarmasamuccayāt \|\|
>
> ‘Surely the highest good arises from knowledge, not from action, that
> cause of bondage.’\*\*  
> ‘No: It arises nor from one \[of these two\], but from a synthesis of
> knowledge and action.’ (p. 158)

**According to Sheldon Pollock** (which is very present in the
theorethical framework of the article), **the rise of theistic Mīmāṃsā
“produced no systemwide change”. Is this judgement accurate** although
it necessarily oversimplifies things**?**

  
\*I am grateful to Anand for having sent me a copy of his article.

\*\*The verse had already been translated, among others, by Roque
Mesquita, who interpreted *bandhahetor* as the content of *jñāna*: “The
knowledge of the reason of the fetter” (*die Erkenntnis von der Ursache
der Bindung*, 1994). Anand explains that this translation is “erroneous”
and that “*bandhahetor* should construe as a *tatpuruṣa* compound
modifying *karmaṇaḥ*, both in the ablative, rather than as the genitive
object of *jñāna*” (p. 165), which is only a description of his
translation, not of why it should be better than Mesquita’s. The
interpretation of *bandhahetor* as a *karmadhāraya* makes in fact good
sense, although perhaps the text was ambiguous on purport. Anyway, I
would recommend the author in the future to explain in more detail why
he dissents, according to the rules of a proper *vāda*

(Full disclosure: I am myself very interested in the issue of the links
between Mīmāṃsā and theism. After my 2012
[book](http://www.indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/2105) (on a theist
Mīmāṃsaka), I have recently published a discussion of the link of
Mīmāṃsā and devotion in South India in [Puṣpikā

(ed. by Robert Leach and Jessie Pons). You can read an early draft of it
