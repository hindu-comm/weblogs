What is a body? Veṅkaṭanātha on plants, rocks, and deities

In general, classical Indian philosophers tend to define *śarīra* ‘body’
as a tool for experience (*bhogasādhana*). Thus, most philosophers state
that plants only *seem* to have bodies because of our anthropomorphic
tendencies, which make us believe that they function like us, whereas in
fact plants cannot experience. By contrast,
[Veṅkaṭanātha](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/03/17/ve%E1%B9%85ka%E1%B9%ADanathas-contribution-to-visi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADadvaita-vedanta/)
in the *Nyāyasiddhāñjana* defines *śarīra* in the following way:

> Therefore, this *śarīra* is of two types: permanent and impermanent.
> Among them, permanent are God’s body —consisting of auspicious
> substrates, namely substances with the three qualities, time and
> \[individual\] souls— and the intrinsic form of Garuḍa, the snake
> (Ananta), etc. belonging to permanent \[deities\]. The impermanent
> \[body\] is of two types: not made of karman and made of karman. The
> first one has the form of the primordial *natura naturans* (the
> *prakṛti* of Sāṅkhya), etc.\* of God. In the same way, \[an
> impermanent body not made of *karman*\] assumes this or that form
> according to the wish of the liberated souls, such as Ananta and
> Garuḍa. Also the \[body\] made of *karman* is of two types: made out
> of one’s decision and *karman* and made out of *karman* alone. The
> first type belongs to great \[souls\] like the Muni Saubhari. The
> other one belongs to the other low \[souls\] (i.e., all normal human
> beings and the other conscious living beings). Moreover, the body in
> general is of two types, movable and unmovable. Wood (i.e., trees) and
> other \[plants\] and rocks and other \[minerals\] are unmovable. \[…\]
> That there are souls also in rock-bodies is established through
> stories such as that of Ahalyā.

Thus, the deities have an intrinsic form which is permanent and can
assume further impermanent ones at wish, not depending on *karman*.  
As for rocks and stones, the rationale of their inclusion is the story
of Ahalyā, who was transformed into a stone and then back into a woman,
a fact which proves that a soul was present also while she was a stone.
Her story is told, e.g., in the Rāmāyaṇa.

\*The first commentary explains this *ādi* as referring to God’s
emanations, the *vyūha*s, which are a typical mark of Pāñcarātra
theology throughout its history.

**Note the limitation in the precinct of application of *karman*, which
seem to only determine one’s body and not one’s entire life. Further,
why do you think Veṅkaṭanātha does not explain away Ahalyā’s story? What
is he aiming at through the inclusion of stones?**
