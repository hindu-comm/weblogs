Hermeneutic principles in Mīmāṃsā

The hermeneutic principles are the ones which regard only the Brāhmaṇa
texts and whose significance could not be automatically extended outside
them, e.g., to a different corpus of texts, or can be extended, but
regard characteristics of language. Mīmāṃsā authors had to develop them
first of all out of an epistemological concern, namely because they
considered the prescriptive portion of the Veda authoritative and thus
needed to distinguish the authoritative portion of the Veda.  
Consequently, in order to make sense of complex texts like the
Brāhmaṇas, in which it is not at all easy to distinguish what belongs to
a certain ritual and what to another, Mīmāṃsā authors needed to be able
to distinguish the boundaries of a given prescriptive passage.
Consequently, some basic hermeneutical rules regard the identification
of single prescriptions through syntax and through the unity and novelty
of the duty conveyed.

In the following list I tried to enumerate the cornerstones among the
hermeneutic principles.

1.  The prescriptive portion of the Veda is never meaningless.
2.  A prescriptive sentence is identified through the syntactical
    expectations among the words forming it and through the single
    purpose it conveys (PMS 2.1.46).
3.  Each prescription must be construed as prescribing a new element.
    Seeming repetitions must have a deeper, different meaning, e.g.,
    enhancing the value of the sacrifice to be performed.
4.  Each prescriptive text, which may entail several prescriptions is
    construed around a principal action to be done.
5.  Each prescription conveys (only) a single piece of deontic
    information (*anyāya ankekārthatva*, ŚBh ad PMS 2.1.12;
    *vākyabheda*, ŚBh ad 1.1.1).
6.  No prescription can be meaningless. If it appears to be meaningless,
    it is not a prescription (vidhiś cānarthakaḥ kvacit tasmāt stutiḥ
    pratīyeta, PMS 1.2.23).
7.  Each prescription should promote an action (*āmnāyasya kriyārthatvād
    ānarthakyam atadarthānāṃ tasmād anityam ucyate*, PMS 1.2.1).
8.  The most powerful instrument of knowledge for knowing the meaning of
    a prescription is what it directly states (śruti), which is most
    powerful than its implied sense, context, syntactical connection,
    etc. (*niṣādasthapatinyāya* PMS 6.1.51–52).
9.  A material may achieve a result resting on an already prescribed
    act, like a king’s officer can achieve a certain result only insofar
    as he relies on the king’s authority (Vṛttikāra within ŚBh ad PMS
    2.2.26).
10. Any prescribed action needs to have a result. If a prescribed action
    seems to have no result, postulate happiness as the general result
    (*viśvajinnyāya*).
11. Only what is intended (*vivakṣita*) is part of the prescription. For
    instance, in sentences such as ”Take your bag, we need to go”, the
    singular number in ”bag” is not intended. What is prescribed is to
    take one’s bag or bags, and not the fact that one must take one bag
    only. By contrast, the singular number is intended in ”You must take
    one pill per day”, meaning that one has to swallow exactly one pill
    per day. Whether something is intended or not is determined through
    its link with the sentence’s principal duty.
