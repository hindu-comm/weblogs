Why call it “history of philosophy” anyway?

[Stephen
Nadler](https://97f5e66c75134aeb73b69b85988728fb77e0f470.googledrive.com/host/0B141kHg-P9BNLTM0S1RyNWF6Tkk/Home.html)
has an interesting and provocative address, “History of Modern
Philosophy: What is it Good For?” in the recent *Proceedings and
Addresses of the APA.* Among other things, he argues that history of
philosophy is just, well, philosophy.

All philosophy, Nadler argues, is dialogical, even if one’s partner is
simply a particular reading of athinker, purely invented, or oneself in
another guise. Distinctively *philosophical* dialogue concernsanalysis
of arguments concerning a certain range of topics in metaphysics, value
theory, epistemology, etc. As such, thatone’s interlocutor is alive or
recently deceased isreally irrelevant to whether the work one does is
philosophy *simpliciter*.

Understood this way, Nadler distinguishes workin“history
ofphilosophy” from that of “intellectual historians,” whose concerns
are largely about social and personal influences, clarifying who said
what, and the development of ideas over time. Clearly, one can do both
tasks at the same time, and I have a hunch that perhaps one *must*, in
some way do both, but this is not our concern here. His point, and mine
here, is not to disparage intellectual history, but to at least bracket
it for the time being. One may, however, consider [other
posts](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/07/23/whither-indian-philosophy/)
which argue that such should be on the back burner when advancing Indian
Philosophy.

I found Nadler’sremarks pertinent to things I’ve been thinking about
lately re:what makes work in philosophy “historical.”

Last week, a friend and I were chatting about David Lewis’ modal realism
and whether the temporal counterparts found in four-dimensional theories
of time were more palatable philosophically than Lewis’ modal
counterparts. Now does the fact that Lewis died in 2001 make this chat
an exercise in history of philosophy? Clearly, no. So let’s cross
off“must involveliving dialogical partners”from the criteria of what
makes philosophical workhistorical.

Is it something more impressionistic, like having a significant emphasis
on linguistic, philological, and interpretive elements that makes such
work historical? Well, what about work that centrally engages
withFrege, Heidegger or Wittgenstein? And of course, what about people
who don’t have English as a first or second language, and yet work on
contemporary analytic thought through translation and reconstruction of
texts in a foreign tongue?

Maybe the interlocutors must be dead for a long time? But, to use but
one example, Ernest Sosa has centrally engaged withDescartes in his
worklately, and Sosa is, of course, no *mere* historian.

What if it is devoted to expounding and interpreting a certain thinker
in a way that is, with no disparagement intended, parasitical upon their
work? This would then make a dissertation on, e.g., Russell’s theory of
definite descriptions a work in history of philosophy? No, that won’t
work either then.

So, what makes something “history of philosophy’ such that it need be
distinguished from some other way of framing it (e.g., simply
epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, or the close study of this or that
thinker)? Is there a good set of criteria, or at least rough guidelines
that work? Or must we simply come to the same conclusion we do with many
labels or concepts: they are simply a shorthand that we use, knowing
full well that they are sloppy and problematic, but for which there
areno easy substitutes or fixes. Or, finally, is this distinction
between history of philosophy and philosophy proper pernicious and akin
to other sorts
of[problems](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/17/christian-coseru-on-philosophys-western-bias/)
that the [cosmopolitan
impulse](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/24/towards-an-institute-for-cosmopolitan-philosophy/)
seeks to shun?
