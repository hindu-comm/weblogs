Congratulations to David Buchta and Malcolm Keating

Two young luminaries in our field, [David
Buchta](http://brown.academia.edu/DavidBuchta) and [Malcolm
Keating,](http://www.malcolmkeating.com/) have successfully defended
their dissertations at Penn and Texas respectively. Let’s all
congratulate them! David and Malcolm are, among other things, both
Alaṅkārikas (broadly construed), with Malcolm’s dissertation on
Mukulabhaṭṭa and pragmatics (as seen
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/10/07/mukulabha%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADa-and-pragmatics-in-indian-philosophy-a-guest-post-by-malcolm-keating/)),
and David’s onRūpagosvāmin’s *Stavamālā.* I’d like to get David and our
own Andrew Ollett in the same room at some point.
