Hindu-Christian studies prize

Every two years, the Society for Hindu-Christian Studies grants an award
for the “Best Book in Hindu-Christian Studies.” The awards alternate
between two categories (Theology/Philosophy and History/ Ethnography),

and cover a four year period of publication. Books nominated for the
prize must be published between July 1st in the first year and July 1st
in the last year of the cycle. The award carries a $500 honorarium.

Nominations are now being accepted for the Best Book in Hindu-Christian
Studies—Theology/Philosophy (**2011-2015**). Please send nominations to
Michelle Voss Roberts (robertmv@wfu.edu), Wake Forest University, chair
of the Book Award Committee.

At the society’s annual meeting in November 2015, the Book Award
Committee will announce a shortlist of books under consideration for the
award. In February 2016, the committee will announce the winner, and the
award will be presented at the 2016 annual meeting. To celebrate this
award winner, the society will also sponsor a panel discussion of the
book, to which the author will be invited to respond.

Please consider bringing a deserving book to the Society’s attention by
nominating it for this prize.

(Thanks to Ram-Prasad for the pointer.)
