Conveying prescriptions: The Mīmāṃsā understanding of how prescriptive texts function

The Mīmāṃsā school of Indian philosophy has at its primary focus the
exegesis of Sacred Texts (called Vedas), and more specifically of their
prescriptive portions, the Brāhmaṇas. This means that the epistemic
content conveyed by the Vedas is, primarily, what has to be done. In
order words, the Veda is an epistemic authority only insofar as it
conveys a deontic content.  
In order to fulfil the hermeneutical task of Mīmāṃsā, Mīmāṃsā thinkers
developed interpretative rules which should guide a reader or listener
through a prescriptive text and enable his or her understanding of the
text. Such rules have the key purpose to enable the understanding of a
text without resorting to the intention of the speaker (either because
he or she is distant in time or space or because, as in the case of the
Vedas, the text has an autonomous epistemic value). This post will
elaborate on these basic principles and on the way they can make a text
into an epistemic instrument conveying information concerning what one
ought to do.

Little research has been done on the Mīmāṃsā hermeneutical rules. Apart
from a paper of mine (a draft of which is available
[here](https://www.academia.edu/5485380/Paribh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3%C4%81s_in_P%C5%ABrva_M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81)),
there is an alphabetic list, appended to Jhā 1964, of these rules, which
does not distinguish between their function and their hierarchical
relations.  
The present post has been prompted by the attempt to understand and as
far as possible re-construe the system of rules (Mīmāṃsā authors speak
in this connection of *nyaya*s) which was operating beyond the Mīmāṃsā
interpretative strategies. Although it is possible that Mīmāṃsā authors
used only an ad hoc approach and thought of specific rules at each
problem, the structure of the *Śābarabhāṣya* (the commentary on the root
text of the Mīmāṃsā school, adopted by all currents within it) suggests
a different interpretation. In fact, the SBh displays a clear five-fold
structure:

1.  enunciation of the topic (*viṣaya*)
2.  enunciation of the problem (*saṃśaya*)
3.  prima facie view about the problem
4.  antithesis to the prima facie view
5.  conclusive view

The steps 3–5 can be repeated several times if the problem is
particularly complex and needs a detailed discussion. More important,
from our point of view, is that the upholder of the prima facie view,
the upholder of the antithesis and the upholder of the conclusive view
(who can be identified with Śabara himself) all recur in their
discussion to the application of rules. In fact, the discussion is
mostly all about which rule should be applied and why or why not.  
The first problem for the identification of the basic principles, the
ones presupposed by the majority of the other rules, is the intersection
of two sets of principles. On the one hand there are the logical
principles, which regard the logical structure of the Mīmāṃsā deontic
logic, while on the other hand there are the hermeneutic principles
needed to recognise the boundaries of a given prescription and the way
it is formulated. The two sets of principles overlap only in part.

-   The hermeneutic principles are the ones which regard only the
    Brāhmaṇa texts and whose significance could not be automatically
    extended outside them, e.g., to a different corpus of texts.
-   As for the logical principles, it is highly improbable that Mīmāṃsā
    authors ever wanted to build a consistent deontic system of logic.
    Rather, they focused on a given set of texts and developed logical
    tools in connection with such texts. Nonetheless, some of the
    principles they formulated are liable to be extended beyond the
    Brāhmaṇa corpus.

**Does this distinction convince you? Do readers familiar with the
Grammatical *paribhāṣā*s think it can be applied there?**
