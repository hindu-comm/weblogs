If you have honey at home, why going to the mountains? The principle of parsimony in Mīmāṃsā

Beside their specific commitment to some
[hermeneutic](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/12/22/hermeneutic-principles-in-mima%e1%b9%83sa/ "Hermeneutic principles in Mīmāṃsā")
metarules regarding the linguistic and prescriptive nature of the Vedas,
Mīmāṃsā authors also strictly adhere to the principle of parsimony
(*lāghava*). This principle says that one should avoid unnecessary
effortsand it applies to different fields. For instance, if a ritual
prescription says that one should sacrifice “animals” (in plural), one
should sacrifice the lowest number of animals satisfying the
requiremenet of the prescription, namely three (two animals would be
expressed in Sanskrit with the dual number). Similarly, unnecessary
speculations should be avoided, if an easy explanation of a given
phenomenon is available, as with Ockham’s Razor.

The principle of *lāghava* is also differently expressed. In the
*Śābarabhāṣya* ad 1.2.4, this is expressed as in the title of this post,
with a further hemistich explaining that there is no point in making
further efforts once the result can be easily achieved, but the
principle is omnipresent in Mīmāṃsā. For instance, it rules the way
Mīmāṃsakas apply the instruments of knowledge to understand what is
connected with a given prescription (from *śruti* onwards, see PMS
3.3.14), with the general idea that unless there is a serious reason,
one goes for the easiest solution (e.g., what is directly enjoined
overrules what one could understand out of context). Careful readers
will have already noted that this is the same approach which is
detectable in Kumārila’s most well-known epistemological innovation,
namely his theory of the self-validity of cognition (*svataḥ prāmāṇya*).
There, once again, unless and until the opposite is proved, each
cognition should be accepted as valid, and there is no requirement to
always look for further confirmations.

What is the impact of the principle of parsimony on the overall Mīmāṃsā
philosophy? In my opinion, it hints at the fact that what runs the risk
of being seen as a direct realism is instead a system based on
truth-as-consistence more than on truth-as-correspondence.

I am grateful to Kiyotaka Yoshimizu for having discussed the topic of
*kalpanālāghava* with me (all mistakes in this post are only mine).
