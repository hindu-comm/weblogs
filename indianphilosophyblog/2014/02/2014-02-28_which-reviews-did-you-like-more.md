Which reviews did you like more?

If I leave aside the ones I liked primarily because I was interested in
the topic, the first ones which come to my mind are:

-   André Padoux’ review of *Hindu Tantrism* (by Sanjukta Gupta, Derk
    Jan Hoens, Teun Goudriaan), review published in
    [1981](http://www.scribd.com/doc/107024782/a-padoux-review-zu-hindu-tantrism)
-   John Taber’s review (called *Much ado about nothing*,
    [2001](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/606730?uid=3737528&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21103542048377))
    of B. Kellner’s *Nichts bleibt nichts* and his review of Franco’s
    *Dharmakīrti on Compassion and Rebirth*(called *Dharmakīrti against
    Physicalism*,
    [2003](http://www.scribd.com/doc/106621810/Dharmakirti-Against-Physicalism))
-   Simon Brodbeck’s review of Ch. Framarin’s *Desire and motivation in
    Indian philosophy*,
    [2010](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0160?uid=3737528&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21103542393407)
-   Robert Leach’s review of A.Nicholson’s Unifying Hinduism (also
    discussed on this blog,
    [here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/19/a-synthesis-beyond-orientalism/ "A synthesis beyond Orientalism")),
    [2011](http://litthe.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/474.extract)

The common feature in all these reviews is that they are critical in an
intelligent way. They do not impose on the reader useless lists of typos
or of similar minor points, rather, they engage with the text and see
its points of strength and, through them, its weaknesses. They are also
critical in a constructive, non demolishing way. They do not aim at the
demolition of the book or of its author, but at its enhancement. They, I
imagine, did good to the author and to his/her readers. (**What do Chris
and Andrew think, if they want to share it?**) Yet, critical reviews are
often feared. Some journals (e.g., the JAOS) especially warn reviewers
asking them to avoid critical reviews. The Dissertation Reviews
[website](http://dissertationreviews.org/) forbids them. I am all for a
ban of useless critical reviews, filled with [ad
hominem](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2012/07/reviews-and-personal-attacks.html)
[attacks](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2012/08/reviews-filled-with-venom.html)
or list of minor mistakes. But don’t we in this way run the risk to end
up with uniformly favorable reviews, ones which do not allow readers to
distinguish between good and bad works? Last, as an author myself, I
fear not being read much more than I fear critical reviews written by
people who engaged with my work.  
Do you agree? If so, why don’t we think of lunching a “**honest
reviews**” section on this blog? In my opinion, the featured reviews
would need to be

1.  critical (no discount here)
2.  dedicated to important works (it is neither fun nor useful to
    criticise books that are just worthless)

Hopefully, 2. should make authors happy to have their works dealt with
here, albeit in a critical way.  
**What do you think? Which reviews would you like to read or write here?
And which reviews did you like more?**
