What is involved in a religious identity? On the Introduction of Leach 2012

What are the Pāñcarātras? Is there anything like a uniform Pāñcarātra
Canon and/or Theology? Or are these texts only part of a constellation
which has been made consistent by its later interpreters?

The standards required for PhD theses vary a lot from country to country
and from system (e.g., in Italy you cannot exceed a given number of
years to finish your thesis) to system.  
Nonetheless, Robert Leach’s *Textual Traditions and Religious Identities
in the Pāñcarātra* (Edinburgh 2012) is a surprisingly mature work. It
deals with the Pāñcarātra “Canon” and with the definition of a
Pāñcarātra identity, also in relation to the Vedas.

The work starts as, I have argued
[elsewhere](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2009/07/in-praise-of-reading.html "In praise of reading"),
all good works should, i.e., with a critical and intelligent review of
the existing literature on the topic. Already in these first pages Leach
detects several open problems, namely

-   1\. **the anachronism involved in** our definition of the Pāñcarātra
    texts and their followers as **“Vaiṣṇavas”**. In fact, several texts
    are dedicated to Nārāyaṇa, Vāsudeva etc., which have been only later
    reinterpreted as avatāras of Viṣṇu (to the topic of the various gods
    hidden beyond Viṣṇu has been dedicated a workshop in Vienna, april
    2012, whose proceedings are currently being edited by Marcus
    Schmücker—of particular relevance in this connection was Katherine
    Young’s distinction between Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa).
-   2\. the **multifoldness** of the “Pāñcarātra tradition”, whose first
    witnesses are present in the *Mahābhārata*, in Śa’nkara and in a 7th
    c inscription, but whose texts have been composed in Kashmir and
    (later?) in South India possibly between the 9th and the 14th c.
-   3\. connected with the above, the problem of the **textuality** of
    religious traditions. Leach discusses the anthropological turn in
    religious studies, focussing on practices rather than on texts, but
    also G. Flood’s emphasis on the textual nature of Indian religions.
    In this connection, one is reminded of the textual reference of
    several Sanskrit terms used to define “religious traditions”, such
    as *tantra* and *śāstra*. On the other hand, exactly the case of the
    Pāñcarātra seems to hint at the case of a religion which pre-existed
    its main texts. Would Flood think that also in this case there were
    texts, although they are no longer extant?

The problem of the existence of a textual tradition of Pāñcarātra leads
us to the problem of the existence of a Pāñcarātra **identity**. Leach
collects interesting hints at the idea of a *darśana* in the earliest
Saṃhitās, as well as mentions of a *mahākula* ‘big/great lineage’ which
might be the homeland of all Bhāgavatas. Its boundaries are some ritual
practices (typically, the pañcakāla one? —Rastelli showed however how
this identification was at first used by non-Pāñcarātrins and not by
Pāñcarātrins while talking about themselves). Leach also discusses the
many references to a textual corpus (śāstrapīṭha) since the earliest
Saṃhitās, something which again brings us back to the relation with the
Vedic corpus.

In fact, the relation to the Veda presents several interesting
peculiarities:

1.  Like the śaiva tantras, the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās present themselves
    as describing a **higher** revelation, one which requires a specific
    initiation to be accessed on top of the upanayana ceremony.
2.  However, the Pāñcarātra should also be **based on the Ekāyana
    Veda**, a unitary Veda from which the four Vedic Saṃhitās later
    originated.
3.  Last, its interpreters (notably, Vedānta Deśika) have used different
    strategies to show that the Pāñcarātra were also Vedic (e.g.,
    insofar as they were **based on the Vedic Saṃhitas**, like the
    ritual *sūtra*s).

**What do you think about the textual basis of Indian religious
identities?**
