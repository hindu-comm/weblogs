On Vyāsa and the authorship of the Saṅkarṣakāṇḍa

(apologies in advance for the lack of diacritics, I am home, ill, with
no access to a unicode keyboard)

The *Sankarsakanda* (henceforth SK, about which see
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/02/04/how-many-texts-are-comprised-in-the-mimamsa-sastra-and-why-is-this-relevant/ "How many texts are comprised in the Mimamsa Sastra? And why is it relevant?"))
is an enigmatic text thought to complete the Mimamsa Sastra, after the
Purva Mimamsa Sutra (henceforth PMS) and before the Uttara Mimamsa Sutra
(or Vedanta Sutra, henceforth UMS).

As for its origin, several witnesses speak of the SK as having been
authored by Jaimini (e.g., the first commentator of the SK, Devasvamin;
the Vrttikara’s quote mentioned by Ramanuja, the *Prapancahrdaya*,
Madhusūdana Sarasvatī and Śambhubhaṭṭa), whereas the
*Sarvasiddhantasamgraha* attributes it to Vyasa, together with the UMS
(see Kanazawa, p. 41). The *Sarvamatasangraha* might depend on the
*Sarvasiddhantasangraha* when it also attributes both the SK and the UMS
to Vyasa, but it adds a new nuance, that is, it states that they both
deal with brahman, *saguna* and *nirguna* respectively. Vedanta Desika
refers to the SK’s author as Kasakrtsna, the name of an ancient
Mimamsaka of whom no other work has been preserved.  
In a learned and insightful study of 2012, Ashok Aklujkar has supported
this attribution, on the basis of the fact that:

1\. The name “Sankarsa” does not need to refer to the author and anyway
all evidences mentioning such a Sankarsa mention him as the commentator
of the SK, not as its author.

2\. The attestations (e.g. in the Vrttikara’s quote preserved in the
*SriBhAsya* and in the *Sesvara Mimamsa*) regarding the SK as
*jaiminiya* only mean “connected with Jaimini’s PMS” and not “authored
by Jaimini”.

3\. Kasakrtsna is a suitable candidate, being an ancient Mimamsaka, and
there is no other way to explain the attribution of the SK to him, given
that he was neither well-known nor influential (in other words,
attributing the SK to him does not resemble the attribution of the
*Yogabhasya* to Vyasa and similar cases).

A few elements may be added to Aklujar’s learned reconstruction (which,
by Aklujkar’s own assumption, limits itself to the extant SK and does
not take into account the
[SK-devatakanda](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/02/04/how-many-texts-are-comprised-in-the-mimamsa-sastra-and-why-is-it-relevant/ "How many texts are comprised in the Mimamsa Sastra? And why is it relevant?")).

1\. Venkatanatha clearly needed the SK–devatakanda in his attempt to
show the unity of the Mimamsa sastra and its theistic core.

2\. In this connection, the attribution of the SK to Vyasa, with the
underlying assumption that the same brahman was dealt with under two
different perspectives might have suited him best.

3\. However, his illustrious predecessor, the Vrttikara, had attributed
it to Jaimini.

Hence, the forceful interpretation of the Vrttikara’s quote and,
possibly, the resort to an “intermediate” position among the various
ones Venkatanatha may have been exposed to at his time.

**What do you think? Who was the author of the SK? And is there just one
SK?**
