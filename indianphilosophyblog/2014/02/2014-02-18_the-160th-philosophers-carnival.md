The 160th Philosophers’ Carnival

In case you never checked it, the Philosophers’ Carnival is a review of
the best philosophical blog posts of each month and it is hosted each
month on a different blog.  
The February
[one](http://blog.kennypearce.net/archives/the_web/blog_carnivals/philosophers_carnival_160.html "160 Philosophers' Carnival")
is a very interesting Carnival, which lists posts I either knew and
liked or discovered through it and liked even more. I am very grateful
for being mentioned (not because of my personal
[blog](http://elisafreschi.com "Elisa Freschi's blog"), though, but
because of
[this](http://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2014/02/can-there-be-free-will-in-heaven.html "Is there free will in heaven?")
post on Free Will in heaven) although I did not even submit my post.
Even more interesting is the mention of Matthew Dasti’s
[post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/03/indian-philosophy-in-one-paragraph/ "Indian Philosophy in One Paragraph")
on “Indian Philosophy in One Paragraph”. Thanks Kenny Pearce!

You can submit blog posts for the next Philosophers’ Carnival
[here](http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.co.at/ "Philosophers' Carnival")
(be sure you submit also posts about non-mainstream philosophy, be it
Indian or whatever else).

In this connection: I am thinking of proposing our blog as the host of a
future Carnival. It will sound strange, given that almost all Carnivals
neglect non-Western Philosophy, but it might be an interesting chance
for creating spaces for dialogue (or at least fissures in the wall of
neglect).
