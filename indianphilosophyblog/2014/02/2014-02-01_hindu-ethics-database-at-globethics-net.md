Hindu ethics database at Globethics.net

[Globethics.net](http://www.globethics.net/) is a website “to ensure
that people in all regions of the world are empowered to reflect and act
on ethical issues”, creating a global digital library in ethics. Of
particular interest to IPB readers, the site has a [browseable database
on Hindu ethics](http://www.globethics.net/web/cg-hindu-ethics) with an
extraordinarily detailed structure of categories. A similar portal on
Buddhist ethics is promised soon.
