Forging Indian philosophical texts

Did Indian authors forge their authorities? Did they need it, given the
freedom commentators enjoyed (so that Śaiva texts have been used by
Vaiṣṇava authors (see the *Spandakārikā*) and dualist texts by
non-dualist authors (see the *Paratriṃśikā*) as their authorities)?

In fact, it seems that forgery has been used, although this term and its
negative connotations might be completely out of place in classical
India. The first example one might think of is Madhva, who quoted
profusely from texts which have not been traced. If he really forged his
quoted, Madhva would seem to me a unique case in the Classical Indian
horizon —I still do not understand why he did not just interpret the
texts he had at his disposal in the way he wanted.

Now, one might object, Madhva’s case is not that exceptional, given that
many other authors founded their teachings on lost texts. Mīmāṃsā
authors justified the validity of Smṛtis and even of *sadācāra* ‘the
behaviour of right people’ exactly by postulating that they are founded
on lost Vedic texts, or on only-inferable ones (*nityānumeya*). But this
is not a suitable comparison.  
In fact, on the one hand we have Mīmāṃsā and Dharmaśāstra (and later
also Vedānta) authors trying to justify **existing** behaviours on the
basis of **inferred** texts, on the other we have Madhva trying to
ground **new** ideas on the basis of **untraced but existing** quotes.  
Thus, Madhva is more or less doing the opposite of what Kumārila and Co.
were doing.  
However, what about Madhva’s successors and supporters, both within and
without his school (e.g., in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism)? In this case, could
the fact that the idea of lost Vedas was already current have helped in
making the claim that Madhva had quoted from texts which were later lost
less preposterous?  
Perhaps. But I tend to doubt it, given that the claim of loss texts
seems to be always projected to a far-away antiquity, and more
specifically to the Vedas (including texts contemporary scholars would
not recognise as part of the Veda, but which were presented as such,
like the Pāñcarātra Ekāyanaveda). Also the terma-device of “finding”
back (allegedly) lost Buddhist texts had a different purpose (namely
legitimizing whole new texts).  
Madhva and his followers, as far as I know, never used the lost Veda
argument to support their claims. This might be a further indirect
evidence of the fact that they also thought of the two cases as quite
far apart.

**What do you think? Did you ever encounter “forged” texts in Classical
Indian Philosophy?**
