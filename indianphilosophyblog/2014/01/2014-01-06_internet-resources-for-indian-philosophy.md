Internet resources for Indian Philosophy

What are good internet resources for research in Indian philosophy? Here
are a few that come to my mind.

The GRETIL project of electronic Sanskrit
texts:<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/#Intro>

The Monier Williams Dictionary
online:<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/>

The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, whose Indian Philosophy section
is edited by our own Shyam
Ranganathan:<http://www.iep.utm.edu/category/traditions/indian/>

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, whose Indian and Tibetan
section is slowly being built up, edited by Jan Westerhoff, Jay
Garfield, and Jonardon
Ganeri:<http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=indian>

Karl Potter’s bibliography–updated regularly–to the Encyclopedia of
Indian Philosophies:<http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/>

Any others?
