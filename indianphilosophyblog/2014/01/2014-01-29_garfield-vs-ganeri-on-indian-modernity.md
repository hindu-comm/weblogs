Garfield vs. Ganeri on Indian Modernity

Apropos of some of the conversations we’ve been having here lately,
there is a discussion between Jay Garfield and Jonardon Ganeri in the
latest issue of*ThePhilosophical Quarterly,* on the question of
modernity and Indian philosophy. The context is Garfield’s review of
Ganeri’s newest book,*[The Lost Age of
Reason](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lost-Age-Reason-Philosophy/dp/0199218749).*
A few passages speak directly to our concerns:

> Ganeri takes*modernity*to consist not in a rejection of a classical
> tradition but ‘in a profound reorientation to it. The ancient texts
> are now not thought of as authorities to which one must defer, but
> regarded as the source of insight in the company of which one pursues
> the quest for truth’ (p. 1). He illustrates the explicit endorsement
> of such an attitude by at least some Indian philosophers of this
> period in this passage quoted from Raghunātha:
>
> *“The demonstration of these matters which I have carefully explained
> is contrary to the conclusions reached by all the other disciplines.
> These matters spoken of should not be cast aside without reflection
> just because they are contrary to accepted opinion; scholars should
> consider them carefully … (p. 4)”*
>
> Now there are different ways to develop the idea of modernity.
> Depending on how one chooses to characterise modernity, one will
> either see the thought of Indian philosophers in the period Ganeri
> investigates as of a piece with that of early modern Europe or not.
> Ganeri is aware of this and asks us to take the relevant intellectual
> kind to involve simply a commitment to a non-deferential stance with
> respect to the authority of the classics. We can take this as a
> stipulative definition for the purposes of this investigation. But to
> do so not only elides many important questions about the connections
> between the phenomena often associated with modernity. . . .
>
> If we were to attend not to this period but to philosophers of the
> nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we do see the very cluster
> of tropes often associated with European modernity co-present,
> suggesting that this later period might be more characteristically
> modern than that to which Ganeri directs our attention, and that the
> period he addresses is more properly conceived as one of a late
> scholasticism.

Ganeri’s response begins:

> My book defends the claim that there was a kind of early modernity in
> Sanskrit philosophical communities from the 16th and 17th centuries,
> the centuries before colonialism. Jay Garfield, one of the leading
> authorities in Tibetan Buddhism, is well known for his defence of an
> alternative hypothesis: that modernity arrived in India only with the
> colonial introduction of English as the new medium of philosophical
> exchange. It is unsurprising, therefore, that he wants to argue that I
> have not made my case.

And ends:

> In short, I believe that my claim that there was an early modernity in
> the philosophy of the Sanskrit intellectuals of 16th and 17th century
> India withstands Garfield’s criticism. I do not find an echo of that
> modernity in writings in English in the 19th and 20th centuries;
> indeed, on the contrary, I believe that colonialism was largely fatal
> to this incipient early modernity, forcing it underground where before
> it had been prominent and public, and that is why I called the
> book*The Lost Age of Reason*. There is certainly interesting
> philosophy written in English in colonial India, primarily of a
> neo-Kantian and neo-Vedāntic persuasion, but it is in no way an
> inheritance from the philosophical communities whose very existence my
> book sought to bring to light.
