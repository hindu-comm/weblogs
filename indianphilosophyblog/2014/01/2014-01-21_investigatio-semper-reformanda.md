Investigatio semper reformanda

Should we try to periodise Indian philosophy or shall we give up any
attempt, since each one will be criticised and is in some respect
flawed? Periodisation, as recently highlighted by Julius Lipner, is a
form of classification and as such also a form of controlling (Lipner
2013). It is hardly the case that a periodisation is just a neutral act
of recording what has happened (Lipner mentions the case of pre- and
post-Copernicus astronomy). Much more often, to periodise just means to
superimpose what we now deem to be a decisive criterion. If you studied
history in Europe, you probably learnt that the Middle Age “ends” either
at the fall of Byzantium, or in 1492 (discovery of America) or with
Luther’s theses in 1517. Apart from the Eurocentrism of all three, it is
interesting to note how the discovery of America had much less impact on
its contemporaries than one could expect. The fact that there were so
many human beings who could not have heard of Jesus’ message for more
than 1400 years, for instance, did not shake Christian theology from its
foundations (for more on this lack of change, see P. Armandi 1982). A
similar case is the relative small impact of the Islamic invasions on
Indian philosophy, which we discussed already in the comments to
[this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/03/indian-philosophy-in-one-paragraph/ "Indian philosophy in one paragraph")
blog post.

Thus, periodisation is a risky enterprise. However, it is hard to avoid
it, since one needs some structure while approaching the clumsy mass of
uninterpreted historical events.

A similar case is that of the interpretation of the history of a given
philosophical school. It is fascinating to look at Kumārila’s and
Prabhākara’s main philosophical innovations as replies to Dignāga (as
does McCrea 2013), and we as scholars need to have and to provide some
interpretative cues unless we want to end up in a Babel’s library, where
the critical edition of each 20th c. school’s paper counts as that of a
crucial manuscript for the history of Nyāya. However, great theses are
also dangerous, insofar as we tend to cling at them and to become blind
to other hypotheses (cf. on this point Andrew’s commentary on
[this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/03/indian-philosophy-in-one-paragraph/ "Indian Philosophy in One Paragraph")
post).

Remember that relative who would not listen to your revolutionary ideas
and would just say “You think like that because you are young, but you
will change your mind in ten years”? Do you remember hating his frame of
mind which did not allow for any other possible explanation? I, for one,
do not want to exercise the same kind of violence on the texts I read.
Nor do I want to read texts only in order to find confirmations of my
theory (and to have to disregard blatant counter examples).

Long story short: we need interpretative frames as orienteering tools
and because otherwise we would just fall prey of an [even more dangerous
implicit
methodology](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2012/06/again-against-implicit-methodologies.html "Against implicit methodologies").
***But***, if you ask me, I think that all such interpretative schemes
should be constantly revised. Let us attempt great theories, general
periodisations and classifications of authors and ideas, but *if and
only if* we are then not only willing, but also ready to question them.
The great interpretative frame is not a goal to be reached once and
forever. It is “always to be revised”.

**When did the Middle Ages (or Antiquity, or the Modern Age…) “end”
according to your school teachers? And according to your grown-up you?
And, did you ever radically change your interpretation of something?**
