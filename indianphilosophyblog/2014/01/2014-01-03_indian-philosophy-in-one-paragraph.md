Indian Philosophy in One Paragraph

Friends, as researchers and teachers of Indian thought, from time to
time we’ve been called upon to put Indian philosophy on the map, so to
speak, in a simple, accessible way, whether in classrooms, talks, or
papers directed to non-specialist readers. It’s a fun exercise to try to
think through what are to us the well-worn paths of Indian thought
through the eyes of a newcomer, yet I’ve always found it mildly
frustrating, as the communicator in me fears alienating my audience by
talking over them, while the scholar fears offending the nuanced
sensibility of my colleagues in the inevitable act of
oversimplification.

In discussing the classical period, what I’ve tended to use is something
like the following (I’ve basically adapted this this from things I’ve
written):

> For our purposes, “classical Indian philosophy” refers to the
> philosophical developments in and around India from roughly 100 to
> 1800 CE. This period is bracketed on one side by the earlier
> proto-philosophical period centered on the late Vedic culture and its
> discontents (in the form of the Buddhist and Jaina revolts and the
> other*śramaṇa* movements of first millennium BCE), and on the other
> side, the modern period, characterized by a self-conscious attempt to
> reconsider and rearticulate Indian tradition in response to Western
> culture and science, and the problems of modernity more generally.
> Classical philosophers inherit questions and a wide-range of precursor
> views from the proto-philosophical period, including reflections on
> the way in which human action tends to entangle us in a complicated
> sequence of consequence and conditioning, responses tothe problem of
> suffering,which include meditative praxis and liberating gnosis,and a
> general sensitivity to the relation between cognition and reality.
> Responses to these sorts of questionsbecome distinctly
> “philosophical” in the classical period as our thinkers become
> explicitly concerned with both system-building and defending their
> holdings through dialectical engagement with rivals.Features which
> distinguish classical Indian philosophy include the common (though not
> exclusive) use of Sanskrit as the philosophical *lingua franca*; the
> consolidation of various schools of systematic thought (typically
> called *darśanas*, “viewpoints”) with burgeoning commentarial
> traditions upon the ur-texts of each school; and a concern with the
> rational justification of one’s beliefs or the holdings of one’s
> school, which in turn hinges on examinations of legitimate sources of
> knowledge (*pramāṇas*).



As you can see, I have tried a historically-oriented approach rather
than a purely topical or conceptual introduction. I also know that we
can problematize the classical period, and as Ganeri has recently
argued, insert a distinctive “early modern” period (Phillips has simply
called this the “late classical period”, but that’s another discussion).
There are also those thinkers who are modern in chronology, yet still
deeply classical in their sensibility. But, in any case, you must carve
out the main contours before you can file away at the nuances, and this
is my small attempt.

So what would you add? What would you change? Even better, **what’s your
introductory paragraph?** The guidelines are (i) assume that the
audience consists in “intelligent/educated non-specialists” and (ii) you
get one paragraph.
