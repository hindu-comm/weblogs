New Book Series in Comparative Philosophy

On behalf of Alexus McLeod:

(Please note especially the call for proposals regarding volumes on
Indian philosophy.)

**Critical Overviews in Comparative Philosophy** (Rowman and Littlefield
International).

<http://www.rowmaninternational.com/news/critical-overviews-in-comparative-philosophy>

The Critical Overviews in Comparative Philosophy series aims to present
detailed and inclusive surveys of contemporary research in multiple
areas of Asian and Comparative Philosophy. Each volume will outline and
engage with the current research within comparative philosophy through
the lenses of traditional philosophical areas such as ethics,
metaphysics, epistemology, and language/logic, offering those outside
the fields in question (both scholars and students) an up-to-date
picture of the work being done in these areas. This series will cover
topics in East Asian and South Asian philosophy, primarily in a
comparative context.

Each volume will be a single-authored work presenting, synthesizing, and
analyzing recent developments in particular areas within a field of
comparative research, as well as offering promising directions for
future research, outlining possible objections and solutions, and
considering ways the area might be further developed.

These volumes will be arranged by comparative field and by area. The aim
is to both present the main lines of research in each area and also to
engage with the work in each area. One major aim of these volumes will
be to show how recent research in comparative philosophy can be relevant
to the broader study of the history of philosophy in general and to
contemporary “mainstream” philosophical research, through in part
suggesting new directions for contemporary research.

Much recent work in Asian and comparative philosophy offers unique and
interesting solutions to outstanding problems in traditional
philosophical areas. Philosophers working in these “mainstream” areas
tend to overlook work in Asian and comparative philosophy, not simply
due to lack of concern, but due to ignorance about where to look and
about the main features of Asian and comparative philosophy research.
This situation is mainly due to the fact that Asian and comparative
philosophy is not often taught in philosophy departments at graduate
institutions, and even where it is taught, it is hardly ever a
requirement. Many philosophers simply are unaware of what is going on in
Asian and comparative philosophy. One aim of this series is to help to
resolve this difficulty. Volumes will be constructed so as to give the
reader an adequate overview of the main positions and lines of research
in an area, as well as an understanding of where to look to keep abreast
of new developments in their areas of interest. This can be of great
help to scholars and students alike. Graduate students studying Asian
and comparative philosophy, for example, have had to rely on simply
compiling enormous lists of disparate secondary works and wading through
them to determine which are relevant to their particular areas of
interest. There have to this point been no works that offer overview and
analysis of the vast amount of secondary, interpretive, and comparative
work on Asian philosophy. This series aims to fill this gap.

I**f any contributors or others in the areas of Chinese, Indian, and
Comparative philosophy may be interested in proposing future volumes for
inclusion in the COCP series, please contact Alexus McLeod, at
alexusm@gmail.com.** Currently, we are especially seeking proposals from
those working in Indian philosophy and Chinese-Indian comparative
philosophy, though we welcome proposals from those in any area of
comparative philosophy.
