Before “Classical Indian Philosophy”: the influence of the Sāṅkhya logic UPDATED

We discussed already on
[this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/03/indian-philosophy-in-one-paragraph/ "Indian Philosophy in One Paragraph")
blog about how our conception of “classical Indian philosophy” is
contingent and historically determined. For instance, if you were to ask
me what “classical Indian philosophy” for me means, I would at first
answer with “debate between Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā and Buddhist Pramāṇavāda”.
However, as soon as one throws a closer look at the texts, one sees how
this balance was precarious and how the debate had different
protagonists at different times.  
  
Since it is Friday, and Friday is reading time for me, I will discuss in
this connection Toshikazu Watanabe’s *Dignāga on Āvīta and Prasaṅga*
(2013; about *āvīta* see also Franco 1999). The *āvīta* syllogism is
part of the Sāṅkhya terminology, where it denotes a sort of indirect
argument. A typical example is the Sāṅkhya argument about the existence
of a common primordial matter (called *prakṛti* or *pradhāna*):

> “It is impossible that evolutes do not arise from one single cause,
> because \[if this were not the case\] it would follow that they would
> differ \[from each other completely\]” (see Watanabe’s reconstruction
> of the argument at p. 1230: *na vyaktasyaikapūrvakatvābhāvaḥ,
> bhedaprasaṅgāt*).

It is distinguished from the *vīta* ‘direct’ argument, e.g.:

> “A primordial matter exists, because one sees homology\* among the
> various \[evolutes\]” (*asti pradhānam, bhedānām anvayadarśanāt*, see
> p. 1230).

Watanabe shows how Diṅnāga criticises the difference between the *vīta*
and the *āvīta* syllogism, claiming that in fact there is no difference
between the two reasons (i.e., *anvaya* and *bhedaprasaṅga* (*ko hy atra
viśeṣo bhedaprasaṅgānvayayoḥ*, PSV 3.16). Watanabe shows in logical
notation that the point is that for Sāṅkhya \~*anvaya* is tantamount to
*bheda*: thus the two arguments become identical.  
However, Dignāga does not just criticise the Sāṅkhya argument, he
re-interprets it by means of embedding the *prasaṅga* way of reasoning
(what we would call *reductio ad absurdum*) into his *trairūpya*
analysis of the syllogism. In this way, the *reductio ad absurdum*, that
was probably until that point a dialectical device used against one’s
adversaries in debates, became part of the logical structures of
legitimate syllogisms.

Accordingly, Watanabe can aptly show (p. 1232) that the structures of
Dharmakīrti’s *prasaṅga* and *prasaṅgaviparyaya* arguments (two types of
*reductio ad absurdum*) correspond to Dignāga’s analysis of the *vīta*
and *āvīta* arguments.

In other words, the substitution of *prasaṅga* instead of *āvīta* is one
of the instances in which one can observe how the previously dominant
epistemological school, the Sāṅkhya, has been replaced by the Buddhist
epistemological one.

[blog](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/01/17/before-classical-indian-philosophy-the-influence-of-the-sa%E1%B9%85khya-logic/ "Sankhya syllogism").)

\*I am indebted to Toshikazu Watanabe for a valuable comment on my
translation of *anvaya*. I had originally translated it as “continuity”
for etymological reason (*anu-i*– \`to recur’) and because of the
meaning it assumes in the later context of the syllogism. Watanabe
suggests that what is meant with anvaya is, instead, better rendered
with “homology”, which “ means, like in the context of biology, the
similarity or correspondence of nature between things that have a common
evolutionary origin”.
