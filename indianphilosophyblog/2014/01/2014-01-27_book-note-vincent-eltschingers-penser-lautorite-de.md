Book note: Vincent Eltschinger’s “Penser l’autorité des Écritures”

The starting point of every discussion on
[this](http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/3782-5 "Vincent Eltschinger's Penser l'Autorité des Écritures")
book is that it is an amazing achievement: more than 160 pp. of
translation of Dharmakīrti’s *Pramāṇavārttika* and *Svavṛtti* which will
enhance further studies on Buddhist and non-Buddhist epistemology and,
even more important if possible, enable non-Sanskritist readers to have
a glance of Dharmakīrti’s arguments on the epistemological foundation of
one’s beliefs and actions.

The first lot of my comments is directed on the long introductory study
which is, explains the author, only a methodological device to avoid an
over-loaded annotation. In fact, the introductory study is sometimes
(most of all in the first chapter: Contexte historique et idéologique
–V. Eltschinger is a passionate historian), a page-turner. Sometimes, on
the other hand, it resembles more a collection of arguments needed to
understand the following translation and hence runs the risk to be
either too long (to be a handy compendium for the translation) or too
short (if one –as in my case– looks for a philosophical insight into the
Buddhist-Mīmāṃsaka debate).

More in detail, my only genuine criticism is about §1.3.3, p. 45, where
the author describes the Mīmāṃsā’s understanding of the Veda as

> The Smṛti and the Purāṇas are an authorised source of knowledge of
> *dharma* only insofar as they confirm an uncreated revelation, which
> is *the only one to be inscribed in the order of things*. (emphasis
> original)
>
> (Les Smṛti et les Purāṇa ne sont source autorisées de connaissance du
> *dharma* que parce qu’ils corroborent une révélation incréée, *seule
> inscrite dans l’ordre même des choses*.)

This would hint at the idea that there is a natural order of things and
that the Veda is part of it. On the other hand, I have rather the
impression that the Veda is felt by Mīmāṃsakas to be of a complete
different nature as our common experience and to be the only possible
authority in its precinct. That is, as for dharma, there is no order of
things which enables the Veda to be the only authority, rather, the
realm of dharma is tantamount to Veda. Moreover, the Veda is an
instrument of knowledge (*pramāṇa*) only as far as its prescriptive part
is concerned. Hence, no descriptive knowledge of dharma can be driven
out of it, whereas V. Eltschinger’s passage and even more his hinting at
the order of things seems to imply that the Veda has an epistemological
validity in its descriptive rather then prescriptive passages.
