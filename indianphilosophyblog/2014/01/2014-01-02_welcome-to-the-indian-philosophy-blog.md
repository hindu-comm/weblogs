Welcome to the Indian Philosophy Blog!

The Indian Philosophy Blog is a venue for the discussion of Indian
(South Asian) philosophy, however defined. All periods of Indian thought
from the ancient to the modern, and all Indian philosophical schools,
can be discussed here. We expect the blog to consist above all of
substantive reflection on topics related to Indian philosophy, though we
will also post announcements such as calls for papers.

Our post contributors are scholars with academic training in the field.
Comments are welcome from anyone as long as they follow our simple
[rules](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/rules/).
