Indian Philosophers in One Paragraph

I like Matthew Dasti’s idea of describing “[Indian Philosophy in One
Paragraph](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/03/indian-philosophy-in-one-paragraph/),”
and clearly it has generated a lot of interest and fruitful debate. I
thought, however, of a different way of approaching the issue. Can we
list the top twenty or thirty Indian *philosophers*, the ones that would
be indispensable from, say, a general curriculum for the history of
Indian philosophy? Another way of framing this is, If you haven’t read
these philosophers, you don’t have general knowledge of Indian
philosophy. It is bit like saying, If you haven’t read something of
Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Wittgenstein, etc., you haven’t
really grappled with Western philosophy. I think the criteria ought to
be the enduring impact, novelty and sophistication of the philosopher.
I’ve listed a few people (Hindu, Buddhist and Jain, in no particular
order), but I am curious who else should be on the list, or who should
not. I admit that the list lacks any reference to contemporary
philosophers.
