Bloomsbury Research Handbooks in Asian Philosophy

[Bloomsbury
Philosophy](http://bloomsburyphilosophy.typepad.com/continuum_philosophy/),
the publisher previously known as Continuum, has a new series of books
possibly of interest to members: the [Bloomsbury Research Handbooks in
Asian
Philosophy](http://bloomsburyphilosophy.typepad.com/continuum_philosophy/2014/01/new-series-announcement-research-handbooks-in-asian-philosophy.html).
From their commissioning editor: “These are designed to be the first
reference works of their kind in the field. Rather than providing broad
surveys of traditions, these handbooks provide scholarly and focused
analysis of key subjects such as Indian Aesthetics and Philosophy of
Art, Indian Ethics and Chinese Philosophy and Gender.”
