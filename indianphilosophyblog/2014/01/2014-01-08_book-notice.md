Book Notice: Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy

Friends, please forgive the shameless self-promotion. The volume that
Edwin Bryant and I have edited, *Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in
Indian Philosophy,*has just been released by Oxford University Press.

The origin of the book lies in conversations that Edwin and I used to
have when I was an undergraduate at Rutgers. Weâ€™d puzzle over the
question of agency and free will for Indian thinkers, (esp. within
Samkhya and Vedanta) given their penchant for deconstructing the self
and assigning the functions of the empirical agent to various
sub-personal processes. When I became a professor in my own right, our
conversations continued, and we decided to put forth a volume on the
topic, with responses to the question of agency from various leading
schools. I am very pleased with it, having reread much of it recently.
It includes excellent contributions from many brilliant scholars,
including our own Elisa Freschi.
