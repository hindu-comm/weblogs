On justice and activism in Pali Buddhism

My discussion with [Justin
Whitaker](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/) continues
after my [last
post](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/09/trans-inclusiveness-as-an-innovation-to-buddhism/),
which was a response to [his original
post](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2014/08/transbuddhism-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-transbuddhists-org.html)
about trans\* inclusiveness in Buddhism.

There followed a
[discussion](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/14/trans-inclusiveness-as-an-innovation-to-buddhism/#comment-39588)
back and forth between Justin and myself. The discussion has moved away
from anything to do with trans\* issues, which is fine with me because
my point, and I think Justin’s too, was about something bigger: the role
of justice and activism in Buddhist tradition. I won’t try to recap the
discussion here because the link is available for those who haven’t seen
it. I’ll just refresh your memory by quoting Justin’s most recent
comment:

Here is the crux of the disagreement: is it a “modern projection” to say
that Buddhism is “about” awakening and not about justice? I continue to
reply: no, the opposite. It is a modern projection to say that Buddhism
is about justice. (This is a topic I developed in some length with
reference to Śāntideva in the later sections of my [Journal of Buddhist
Ethics
article](http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2013/11/14/santideva-on-gifts-altruism-and-poverty/).)
There *is* one important caveat to be introduced here: the idea that
“Buddhism is about” anything is in its way modern, since the term
“Buddhism”, [like
“Hinduism”](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/08/did-hinduism-exist/),
is a modern one.

However, unlike for “Hinduism”, there is a premodern (or at least
pre-medieval) referent close to the term “Buddhism”, which is
*buddhadhamma*, the teachings of the Buddha. (*Buddhadhamma* is a Pali
term; in Sanskrit it becomes *buddhadharma*, and any number of
permutations in other languages. I will limit this discussion to Pali
and Pali-derived tradition since Justin and I are both quite familiar
with it, and since that’s where the discussion has gone so far.)

The difference between “Buddhism” and *buddhadhamma*, though, is that
*buddhadhamma* refers specifically to the teachings attributed to the
Buddha, the *sutta*, *vinaya* and *abhidhamma* texts; it does *not* mean
“whatever the people we call ‘Buddhists’ happen to do.” If one wanted a
wider equivalent, one could point to the *tiratana* or *triratna*, the
“three jewels” of buddha, dhamma and saṅgha. Here the practices of
Buddhists – the saṅgha – matter. But the saṅgha, traditionally, is the
monkhood, not the householders. So no matter how “Buddhist” we consider
them, the fact that “Buddhist” householders did something is in a
premodern context not a reason to consider it “a part of Buddhism” or
“something Buddhism is about”; it is not part of the *buddhadhamma* or
*tiratana*.

That point may be somewhat tangential to the discussion, because much of
what we have come back to is the *sutta*s themselves (and related texts)
– but it’s worth clarifying our terms here, because it’s easy to get
misled once one starts using terms like “the conventional aspects of
Buddhism”.

Regarding the ultimate/conventional (*samutti/paramattha*) dichotomy,
too, I’ve been trying to say that in the Pali texts, at least, that’s
not even what that dichotomy *means*. I’m not sure that distinction
appears in the suttas at all; if it does, it’s rare. It’s more common in
the abhidhamma, and there it is largely metaphysical, referring to
truth, and usually specifically to the self (which exists at a
conventional level but not an ultimate). I’m not aware of any place in
any Pali text up to and including Buddhaghosa’s time where a distinction
is ever made between “ultimate suffering” and “conventional suffering”.
If we’re trying to get the ancient tradition right, it is likely to
mislead us to apply this vocabulary anachronistically to topics it was
never used to discuss. Talking about liberation vs. politics in terms of
ultimate vs. conventional is like talking about them in terms of
*samathā* vs. *vipassanā* – those terms exist in the tradition, but that
just isn’t what they mean or what they’re about.

In Pali, the distinction Justin is expressing is represented less by the
terms *samutti* and *paramattha*, and more by *lokiya* (Sanskrit
*laukika*) and *lokuttara* (*lokottara*) – worldly and other-worldly.
When *lokiya* action is discussed, it is frequently identified as a
second-best solution: the way to act for those who aren’t good enough
and developed enough to reach for the real *lokuttara* prize. Earning
good *kamma* for a better rebirth, because one is not yet ready to be
liberated from suffering.

Going more specifically to the texts, Justin’s points have tended to
refer back to the Sigālovāda Sutta. Here, indeed, Justin is right to say
that “dealing skillfully in society” matters within the buddhadhamma.
But two things are worth considering here. First, we should note that
the Sigālovāda is a rarity. It’s not the *only* sutta that deals with
conduct in mundane society, but it’s one of a very few, dwarfed by
suttas about awakening and liberation, and the role of monasticism and
metaphysics in leading one there.

But more importantly, and worth stressing again, the Sigālovāda itself
is not about justice, social or otherwise. There is no word in it, as
far as I am aware, that can be reasonably translated “justice” – I can’t
think of such a word in the Pali language in general. The concern is not
with justice but with harmonious relation (and self-cultivation, of
course). Still *less* is the sutta about activism. There is a subtle
form of social change in that some of the structures of existing society
(Vedic rituals) can be safely *ignored* – other things, like the family,
are more important, and one’s existing concern with Vedic ritual should
be reoriented to them. But one doesn’t actually work to change those
existing structures – beyond the fact that perhaps if one changes
people’s minds toward liberation they might ignore those structures too.
One doesn’t work towards social change; one works toward liberation, and
if society happens to change as a result, that’s a nice side benefit.

Does the buddhadhamma, as traditionally understood, include standards of
good conduct within lay society? Yes, but they’re not a major concern of
the texts, they don’t make reference to justice, and they’re not about
activism to change the structures of that society. I think it is fair,
then, to say that the Pali buddhadhamma is indeed “supposed to be about
things that are more important than justice”.
