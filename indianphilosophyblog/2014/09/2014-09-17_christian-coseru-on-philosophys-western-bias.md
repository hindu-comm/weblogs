Christian Coseru on “Philosophy’s Western Bias”

Our colleague Christian Coseru today posted a piece to the New APPS blog
entitled “Philosophy’s Western Bias and What Can Be Done About It.” I’m
curious to see what kind of reaction he receives. In my experience,
professional philosophers in North America tend to get defensive when
this issue comes up. (Fortunately for me, this has not been the case
among philosophers at my home university, SUNY Stony Brook, where we are
preparing to launch a new M.A. program called “History of Philosophies,
East and West.”) Christian’s piece is in part a response to a recent
blog post by Brian Leiter.

[Christian’s
post](http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/09/philosophys-western-bias-and-what-can-be-done-about-it.html#more)
is here:

And here’s the [original post by
Leiter](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/ignorance-of-philosophy-and-identity-politics.html):

It was Jonardon Ganeri who originally called the Leiter piece to
Christian’s and my attention, and suggested that it called for some kind
of response. So, what do you IPB readers think? Is Leiter correct to
decry “identity politics” in philosophy departments?
