Which conferences are on the horizon?

After the
[IABS](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/08/29/third-day-at-the-iabs-franco-on-the-datation-of-dharmakirti-and-some-further-thoughts-on-dharmakirti-dignaga-kumarila/ "(Third day at the IABS:) Franco on the datation of Dharmakīrti and some further thoughts on Dharmakīrti, Dignāga, Kumārila"),
I realised that there were several authors of this blog there, and
perhaps even more readers, and that we could have decided to have at
least a coffee together. Thus, I thought that we could start sharing
where we will be going next, so that others can come to know about what
interesting conferences there are and/or we can find out that we are in
the same place and decide to meet in person.

As for me, I tend to attend three conferences per year.  
I am leaving tomorrow for my last conference in 2014, namely the EAAA
(European Association of Asian Art) one in Olomouc, Czech Republic.
There, I will host a panel, together with Cristina Bignami and Julia
Hegewald, on reuse. You can read more about it
[here](http://elisafreschi.com/announcements/eaaa-on-reuse-in-visual-arts/).

In 2015, I will be in May (25th to 28th) in Athens, for the Atiner
conference, where I am organizing a panel with Malcolm Keating on
langauge as a tools for acquiring knowledge (see the Call for Papers
[here](http://elisafreschi.com/announcements/cfp-language-as-a-tools-for-acquiring-knowledge-atiner-conference/#more-989)).

In June-July (28th to 2nd) I will be in Bangkok for the World Sanskrit
Conference, where I am organising a panel with Marcus Schmücker on the
development of theology in Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta (see the Call for
Papers
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/08/15/one-god-one-sastra-a-panel-for-the-wsc-2015/ "One God, one Śāstra — A panel for the WSC 2015")).

In September (10th to 12th) I will be in Venice for the sixth Coffee
Break Conference on “Comparison and Comparative Methods”, where I am
organising, together with our Andrew Ollett and the CBC team, the whole
conference and in particular a panel on comparative theology (see the
Call for Papers for the whole conference
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/13/cfp-comparison-and-comparative-method-the-sixth-coffee-break-conference/ "CfP: Comparison and Comparative Method—The sixth Coffee Break Conference")).

**What about you?** What would you recommend to attend? Where can one
meet you?
