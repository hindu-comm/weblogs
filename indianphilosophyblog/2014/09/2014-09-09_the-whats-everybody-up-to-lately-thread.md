The “What’s everybody up to lately?” thread

We (Elisa, Amod and I) thought it might be nice to occasionally ask our
contributors and readers to share what they’ve been thinking about
lately, whether research-related, for conferences, teaching, blogging,
organizational or administrative projects, or merely musings on subjects
that interest you.

I’ll get the ball rolling myself, but first let me sneak in a happy
announcement. One blog member who has been a bit silent lately has a
good reason, and has some great recent news: Ethan Mills just accepted a
tenure-track job offer from the Department of Philosophy and Religion at
the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga! Aside from sharing our
recent work, let’s all give Ethan a virtual handshake (or high five)!!!

Let me also add that we’d love to hear fromreaders who aren’t official
contributors about what you’ve been up to or your interests. This would
be a nice way to let our community get to know you a bit.

Personally, I recently finished a paper on Vātsyāyana’s formative
influence on earlyNyāya for the forthcoming Oxford Handbook for Indian
Philosophy (ed. Jonardon Ganeri). In it, I try to illustrate the way in
which Vātsyāyana frames cognition as fundamentally important because of
its action-guiding role, and I try to use this theme to illustrate the
cohesion between a number of his philosophical commitments. I’ve also
just begun what is probably my busiest teaching semester so far. I’m
teaching a number of new courses, including a team-taught seminar,
Wisdom Literature (with a colleague in English) and an honors
colloquium on Comedy and Philosophy (this week’s topic: humor and bad
taste). Given my teaching workload and other pressing responsibilities,
I’ve given myself a self-imposed moratorium on new projects for a few
months. Hopefully, I can also chip away at the small mountain of
books-to-be-read that I’ve been building.

What is everybody else up to?
