Richard Hayes’ review of Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad’s *Eastern Philosophy*

As discussed in the comments on Andrew’s thread, here are some excerpts
from[Richard Hayes’](http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/) review of [Eastern
Philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/Eastern-Philosophy-Dr-Chakravarthi-Ram-Prasad/dp/0297847449)
by our esteemed friend of the blog, Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad. What is
most relevant is the way in which it discusses the challenges and nature
of cross-cultural philosophical exploration. Ram’s work has long been
exemplary in navigating this challenging space with dexterity.

> In 1935 the eminent German philosopher Edmund Husserl argued that
> philosophy is a distinctively European activity and that nothing quite
> like it ever existed in Asia until Asians were exposed to western
> culture. Husserl acknowledged that there were certain resemblances in
> the activities of western thinkers and certain Chinese and Indian
> writers. But he claimed that these similarities were superficial and
> served to mask profound differences that were far more important. The
> distinguishing feature of genuine philosophy, he said, is not simply
> the enterprise of discovering universal truths, living in accordance
> with them and forming social organisations dedicated to educating
> future generations. More than anything else, said Husserl, the
> enterprise of philosophy should be understood as a purely theoretical
> attitude, an exclusively intellectual practice, whose descendants are
> pure mathematics and pure theoretical science.
>
> Traditional Asian thinkers, he observed, never got away from the
> practical issues of serving humanity, ordering human life in the world
> and making the human as happy and free from disease and distress as
> possible. Since Husserl’s time, other European and American
> intellectuals have cautioned against applying western cultural
> terminology to what non-western cultures have done. Debates have been
> waged over whether Confucius, the Buddha and Zhuangzi – admirable and
> intriguing as they are – should be mentioned in the same breath (or
> taught in the same courses) as Socrates, Aristotle, Descartes and
> Husserl.
>
> Partly because these issues, like most that philosophers debate, are
> unlikely ever to be resolved, and partly because doing justice to the
> contours of two-and-a-half millennia of European, Indian and Chinese
> thought is a daunting task, books treating all three philosophical
> traditions are almost as scarce as unicorns.
>
> It is not only because Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad’s book has so little
> competition that it stands out as an achievement in the field of
> comparative philosophy. The intelligent arrangement of the book, and
> the clarity and charm of his writing, make Ram-Prasad’s work one that
> is likely to endure.

> Ram-Prasad has the wisdom not to try to do the impossible. Instead, he
> offers a tasteful blend of Asian philosophy on its own and on western
> terms.Ram-Prasad starts by laying the groundwork on which the the book
> is built. He observes that Indian thinkers were most concerned with
> what it means to say of something that it exists – that it is real as
> opposed to being merely an appearance or an illusion.
>
> Questions of what is real, and how real things interact and cause one
> another, and what is essential and what is accidental, belong to the
> domain of philosophy that has come to be called metaphysics. Indian
> philosophy is metaphysical through and through, says Ram- Prasad, in
> that these metaphysical questions are the foundation of everything
> else Indians discussed. All consideration of what is good, practical,
> ethical or beautiful ultimately take root in the soil of metaphysics.
>
> In China relatively little energy was expended on these metaphysical
> questions. The ultimate concern in ancient China, and in virtually all
> subsequent Chinese eras, was how people ought to live, what they must
> do to achieve inner and social harmony, what wise government is and
> what it means to be a responsible citizen. If other questions do
> arise, they relate to these ultimate meta- ethical questions.
>
> Ram-Prasad argues that because these orientations are so different,
> when Chinese intellectuals were exposed to Indian ways of thinking,
> mostly through the introduction of Buddhism into China, they were
> barely able to make sense of what the Indians were saying. As a
> result, Chinese Buddhism evolved into a system of doctrines and
> attitudes that Indians would barely have been recognised as Buddhism.
> The book then offers an insightful and subtle discussion of ways of
> looking at the self. Although the main focus is on Indian and Chinese
> thinking on the self, the treatment also brings in western notions of
> self, personhood and agency. Ram-Prasad endeavours to explain why some
> Indian Hindus argued that the basic stuff of the entire universe is
> one’s true self, whereas Indian Buddhists argued that there is no self
> except as a convenient social fiction.
>
> While Indians agonised over this problem for centuries, the Chinese
> barely addressed the issue. While metaphysical Indian Buddhists were
> busy denying that the socially conditioned self has ultimate being,
> the metaethical Chinese Buddhists were busy explaining why being
> selfish makes one socially unfit. Having discussed the self,
> Ram-Prasad devotes two chapters to what is good: the “Outward Good”
> and the “Inward Good”. He discusses how a variety of thinkers, Indian
> and Chinese, saw how the outward goods of social justice, harmony and
> stability are related to the personal virtues of wisdom, compassion,
> humanity and sincerity. Generally speaking, he argues, Indian
> philosophers emphasised the cultivation of personal virtue, of which
> social goods were a fortunate by-product, while Chinese philosophers
> focused on the importance of social goods, which personal virtues are
> deemed necessary to achieve.

> If you’re looking for a book that systematically lays out the thought
> of Confucius, Laozi, Zhuangzi and Mozi, or the schools of Indian or
> Chinese Buddhism, Ram-Prasad’s work is not the one.But if you want to
> see the kinds of questions that have arisen on just about every aspect
> of being human, and are prepared to encounter a thrilling array of
> possible answers, this book is sure to be stimulating. Ram-Prasad has
> a gift for laying out philosophical positions so they all seem
> reasonable and compelling, no matter how much they differ.And in this
> he shows himself to be a first-rate writer of philosophy – even by
> Husserl’s narrow definition.
