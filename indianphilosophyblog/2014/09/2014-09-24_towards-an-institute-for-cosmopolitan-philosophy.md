Towards an Institute for Cosmopolitan Philosophy

[Jonardon Ganeri](https://nyu.academia.edu/JonardonGaneri) has recently
posted an online
[blueprint](https://www.academia.edu/8434737/Blueprint_An_Institute_for_Cosmopolitan_Philosophy_in_a_Culturally_Polycentric_World)
for an “Institute for Cosmopolitan Philosophy in a Culturally
Polycentric World”. He suggests an institute with autonomy from the
traditional academy’s disciplinary and area-studies boundaries,
structured as a network spanning different cultural locations.

Ganeri is reflecting on what sort of institution would best encapsulate
the ambitions and promise of the cross-cultural approach in philosophy,
and is openly seeking discussion – whether privately (his email address
is on the
[blueprint](https://www.academia.edu/8434737/Blueprint_An_Institute_for_Cosmopolitan_Philosophy_in_a_Culturally_Polycentric_World)),
or publicly in a blog forum like this one. We’re posting it here to
spread the word, and would like to hear your thoughts.
