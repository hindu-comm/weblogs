Who invented the apoha theory? On Kunjunni Raja 1986

Who invented the apoha theory? If you, like me, are prone to answer
“Dignāga” and to add that Dignāga (as shown by Hattori) was inspired by
Bhartṛhari’s theory and that Dharmakīrti and Dharmottara later
fine-tuned Dignāga’s one, you are ready to have your view challenged by
K. Kunjunni Raja’s article in *Buddhist Logic and Epistemology* (ed. by
B.K. Matilal and R.D. Evans, 1986, I am grateful to Sudipta Munsi who
sent me a copy of it).

Kunjunni Raja argues that, in fact, the theory of exclusion can already
be found in the work by Vyāḍi, an ancient grammarian whose views are
referred to by Patañjali in the *Mahābhāṣya*. Until now, I had known of
Vyāḍi only because he is linked to the theory that words denote
individuals (*vyakti*) and, therefore, opposed to Vājapyāyana who
supported the opposite view that words mean universals (*jāti*). But,
Kunjunni Raja explains, what happens if this theory is applied to the
sentence-meaning? Words denoting individuals end up delimiting each
other by excluding whatever else. Kunjunni Raja refers to a passage
where Patañjali discussed *sāmarthya*, a condition given by Pāṇini for
compounds (Kunjunni Raja quotes a shorter version of the same passage):

> Indeed, the *sāmarthya* is the distinction (*bheda*), or the
> association \[of words in the compound\]. Someone else said: “The
> *sāmarthya* is the distinction and the association”. What is indeed
> the distinction and what is the association? In this \[compound,
> namely *rājapuruṣa*, which can be analysed as “the servant of the
> king” (*rajñaḥ puruṣaḥ*)\], the term “of the king” is automatically
> associated with everything which belongs to him, whereas “the servant”
> is automatically associated with all possible masters. Now, when one
> utters the sentence “Bring the servant of the king!” “the king”
> removes (*nivṛt*-) the servant from all other masters and also “the
> servant” \[removes\] the king from anything else which belongs to him.
> In this way, given that both are determined \[by each other\], if
> \[each word\] relinquishes its own meaning, let it be. It is not the
> case that one can bring a “servant” in general.  
> (*sāmarthyaṃ nāma bhedaḥ, saṃsargo vā. apara āha —bhedasaṃsargau vā
> sāmarthyam iti. kaḥ punar bhedaḥ saṃsargo vā? iha rājña ity ukte
> sarvaṃ svaṃ prasaktam, puruṣa ity ukte sarvaṃ svāmī prasaktaḥ.
> ihedānīṃ rājapuruṣam ānayety ukte rājā puruṣaṃ nivartayaty anyebhyaḥ
> svāmibhyaḥ, puruṣo ‘pi rājānam anyebhyaḥ svebhyaḥ. evam etasminn
> ubhayato svavacchinne yadi svārthaṃ jahāti kāma.˛jahātu na jātucit
> puruṣamātrasyānayanaṃ bhaviṣyati*, MBh ad A 2.1.1.5, p. 330, my
> translation)

In other words, in order to accomplish the order to fetch someone, one
needs a specification, and words, while connected, specify each other.
Does this amount to a proto-apoha theory? I would not say so, although
some key terms are there, most notably *bheda* and *nivṛt*-, since in
this theory each words delimits *another* word’s meaning. It is not the
case that no word has an own meaning. In other words, distinction steps
in for Vyāḍi only at the sentence level, and not as the meaning of each
single word (which is, as already mentioned, an individual).

By the way, I am by no means familiar with Patañjali, but I checked
Kaiyaṭa’s *Pradīpa* and Nāgeśa’s *Uddyota* on this passage and could not
find any indication of Vyāḍi’s name. Kunjunni Raja does not really
elaborate on this point, but refers in a footnote to Helārāja’s
commentary on VP 3.1.2:

> According to the opinion of Vyāḍi, the meaning of a sentence is the
> distinction (*bheda*), because \[the sentence-meaning\] is denoted
> through the fact of being the purpose of the exclusion (*nivṛtti*)
> \[operated\] by the individual substances expressed by words.  
> (*vyāḍimate bhedo vākyārthaḥ, padavācyānāṃ dravyāṇāṃ
> dravyāntaranivṛttitātparyeṇābhidheyatvāt*, my translation).

The interesting challenge now becomes to determin whether later authors
had in view Vyāḍi or already an apohavādin while discussing about bheda
as the sentence meaning. I will discuss Jayanta’s case next week, while
Kunjunni Raja mentions Kumārila (“*Tantravārttika*, p, 447″) and
Pārthasārathi (“*Ślokavārttika* (Benares ed.), p. 854″). I have not
checked them yet, but the first one is quoted by Kunjunni Raja as
follows:

> *bhedo nāma padārthānāṃ vyavacchedaḥ parasparam. \[…\]
> vyaktipadārthapakṣe sarvavyaktīnāṃ gavādipadenaivopāttatvāt
> viṣayaśabdaiḥ śuklādibhiḥ kṛṣṇādivyavacchedamātraṃ vaktavyam.*

I would imagine that a good criterion would be to focus on what is the
locus of exclusion (sentence meaning or each word meaning?). Kumārila
seems to fulfil it, also insofar as he mentions that the words
themselves mean individuals (*vyakti*) and not exclusions.
Pārthasārathi’s text is not reported, and I will need the library to
reopen after Easter to check it.

**Do you know the passages by Kumārila and Pārthasārathi? Do you agree
with Kunjunni Raja’s attribution? Can you think of other examples of
critiques against Vyāḍi (and not the apohavādins)? Last, how long and
how much “popular” was Vyāḍi?
