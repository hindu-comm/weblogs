Trusting our sources: manuscripts, archaeology, and what we “cannot know”

I am fresh back from the “[Buddhism and Social
Justice](http://www.buddhismandsocialjustice.com/basjconference.html)”
conference hosted by Leiden University, The Netherlands.

This will be the first in what I hope will be a number of posts in the
coming weeks about individual papers and ideas flowing from the
conference, posted both here and/or at my own blog, [American Buddhist
Perspective](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/)(s). This
post has to do with methodology and how we approach our sources, so I
think it is something everyone here can appreciate and, I hope, offer
feedback on. At the conference [Prof.Steven
Collins](http://salc.uchicago.edu//faculty/collins) made the very
interesting plea:

> Don’t touch early Buddhism. It doesn’t exist. We don’t know anything
> about it. Anything you say about it is a complete fantasy. But, if you
> start out a lecture course or a book with early Buddhism, necessarily,
> whatever your fantasy, the rest of the book is going to look like a
> degeneration, or an accommodation, or something else.
>
> So then we get this strange thing in Buddhist Studies, which you don’t
> get in Catholic Studies: theory vs practice. Nobody would think of
> giving a lecture course on Catholicism with: ‘here’s the theory, but
> here’s the practice.’
>
> And it seems so natural for us in Buddhism, because of the essentially
> 19th century Romantic ideas that both Buddhists and Western scholars
> had about ‘the early period’. So it is not only that it is*difficult*
> to fantasize about early Buddhism, it is positively harmful for your
> health.

[Prof. Jonathan Silk](http://hum.leiden.edu/lias/staff/silk.html), who
spoke earlier on the same day, made the similar observation that many of
our common assumptions about Buddhist ideologies and communities are
challenged by the reality of Buddhist history and of contemporary
Buddhist societies (e.g. records of slave ownership by Buddhist
institutions in various times and places – specific instances in Tibet,
China, Burma, and Korea were all discussed separately in the
conference).

After outlining some other instances of Buddhists behaving badly, Silk
asked the very important question: “Just what is the relation between
our expectations and the materials we study?”

And it is this question I hope we might ponder as a collection of
students and scholars of Indian Philosophy.

Silk went on to note that much work on Buddhism begins with an
examination of the ideas of the Buddha himself; notably Richard
Gombrich’s 2009 book “What the Buddha Thought.” He then said, “Speaking
for myself, I am entirely convinced that we have no idea, and
never*will* have any idea what the Buddha thought, or believed or did.
But I am equally convinced that, from the point of view of disinterested
scholarship, this of absolutely no importance whatsoever. What we do or
can know is what Buddhists, or at least*some* Buddhists, thought the
Buddha thought.”

This leads me to the natural question, “What are your thoughts on what
Silk thinks about Buddhists thinking about what the Buddha thought?”
(insert grimace)

Some of you, I hope, will have done some comparative work on thinkers
roughly contemporaneous to the Buddha such as Plato and Aristotle. I
didn’t get too far with either of these, but I do seem to remember that
Aristotle’s work disappeared from the Western (Latin) world for some
time and only survived through Arabic sources which then had to be
translated into Latin and eventually European vernaculars.\* Apparently,
at least some Greek sources also survived to be transmitted directly
into Latin, etc. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on
[Aristotle’s
Biology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/) reports:

> The surviving corpus of Aristotle derives from medieval manuscripts
> based on a 1stcentury BC edition. There were no commentaries on the
> biological works written until they were collectively translated into
> Arabic. The first appearance of Aristotle’s biological writings in the
> West are Latin translations of an Arabic edition by Michael Scot,
> which forms the basis of Albertus Magnus’*De animalibus*. In the
> 13thcentury William of Moerbeke produced a Latin translation directly

Our foundational edition dates to the 1st century B.C.E., some 200 to
300 years after Aristotle’s death. How can we have any faith that this
edition accurately maintain’s Aristotle’s ideas? [Prof. Martha
Nussbaum](http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/nussbaum.html), in her
work on*De Motu Animalium (MA)*, gives a compendium written by
[Nicolaus of
Damascus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_of_Damascus) (b. \~64
B.C.E.), paraphrases in the works of Themistius (317-390 C.E.) and
Simplicius (c. 490- c. 560 C.E.), and a reference by Philoponus (490 –
570 C.E.) as being the evidence that there is “as much early external
evidence for the authenticity of the*MA* as there is for any of the
major works with whose tradition it is associated” (p.5).

It is worth noting that, [according to wikipedia at
least](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_of_Damascus#Compendium_on_Aristotle),
our manuscript evidence of the first of these itself only goes back to
the 14th century C.E. It seems then, that hard evidence about*anything*
that Aristotle thought is completely lacking given the strict criteria
that Silk and Collins seem to espouse.

Perhaps we could attribute greater fidelity to them because the Greeks
used writing rather than oral tradition, but there is at least some
scholarship that shows that texts preserved in writing fair no better
than teachings that are orally preserved (I think here of various books
by Bart Ehrman on the evolution of the Bible, but suggestions closer to
our purposes, either pro or con, would be greatly welcomed).

That brings us to the next problem, the connection between those 1st
century B.C.E. foundations and what existed in the 9th century. We know
that the Bible was altered over the centuries as manuscripts were
copied, and for skeptically minded scholars, it will seem almost certain
that at least some elements of the Pāli Canon and Aristotle’s works were
as well.

So can we talk meaningfully about “Aristotle’s ideas” or is this merely
a projection of 19th century Romantics, as Collins suggests was the case
with the lingering interest in “early Buddhism”? How about other Indian
philosophers? How much of what we “know” about their ideas comes down
only through now-long-lost manuscripts and only very late extant
materials which may or may not accurately reflect their thought?

I must admit that when I studied ancient philosophy, there was no
skepticism of this sort in my professors. Certainly, when it came to the
Pre-Socratics for whom we have merely fragmentary evidence to begin
with, our understanding is also fragmentary, but we were never told
that, for instance “the fragments of Heraclitus tell us more about what
philosphers, orat least*some*philosophers, thought Heraclitus
thought.”

Those of you familiar with Gregory Schopen’s “Bones, Stones, and
Buddhist Monks” (1997) will know these arguments well enough. In the
first chapter of that book, entitled “Archaeology and Protestant
Presuppositions in the Study of Indian Buddhism” he writes:

> When Europeans first began to study Indian Buddhism systematically
> there were already two bodies of data available to them, and the same
> is true today. There was, and is, a large body of archaeological and
> epigraphical material, material that can be reasonably well located in
> time and space, and material that is largely unedited and much of
> which was never intended to be “read.” This material records or
> reflects at least a part of what Buddhists-both lay people and
> monks-actually practiced and believed. There was, and is, an equally
> large body of literary material that in most cases cannot actually be
> dated and that survives only in very recent manuscript traditions.) It
> has been heavily edited, it is considered canonical or sacred, and it
> was intended–at the very least–to inculcate an ideal. This material
> records what a small, atypical part of the Buddhist community wanted
> that community co believe or practice. Both bodies of material, it is
> important to note, became available to Western scholars more or less

The choice, of course, is the archaeological material, which turned out
to be the road not taken, by and large to this day.

To me this marks an at times rather sharp division between historical
and philosophical (sometimes called phenomenological) approaches to the
study of religion. I’d like to be charitable and say that both
approaches are valid and are capable of yielding new and complimentary
understanding of ancient thought and ways of life. We can debate the
thought of Aristotle based on quite late evidence, holding out that
perhaps a discovery will add to his body of works or, contrarily,
somehow show that some of what we have taken to be “his” work is in fact
an invention by later authors. However, this last week I was reminded
once again that for at least some, this charitable approach will not do,
and only one way of approaching philosophy – or intellectual history –
can produce results worth pursuing.

So, my questions for philosophers is: how do you work with historians,
especially those who are sceptical of the possibility of understanding
what early philosophers meant or thought? Is the analogy with Ancient
Greek thinkers fatally flawed for some reason? Or are we just decades
behind our counterparts in this area when it comes to carefully debating
the merits of the authenticity of texts?

\*[Aristotle’s *De Motu Animalium*: Text with Translation,
Commentary,and Interpretive
Essays](http://books.google.com/books/about/Aristotle_s_De_Motu_Animalium.html?id=ISD05P7TcOAC).
Princeton: Princeton University Press (1978)by Martha Nussbaum offers
insight into how a contemporary philosopher approaches these questions.

[*De
Anima*](http://books.google.com/books?id=vn4P6f0IuH8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)
by Nussbaum and Amelie Rorty presents much the same picture.
