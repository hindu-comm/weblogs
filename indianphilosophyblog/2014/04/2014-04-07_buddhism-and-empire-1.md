Buddhism and Empire (1)

A series of reflections and notes around the relationship between
Buddhism and the political category of the Empire.

\*

The most superficial survey on Buddhist political ideas through history
will immediately reveal that the favourite political system of Buddhism
is the Empire (let’s forget, here, about what other religions, Indian
and non-Indian, maintain).

The all-time favourite political leader in Buddhism is the
*cakravartin*, “world emperor”. Emperor Asoka, for instance, is
generally considered Buddhist because Buddhists have wanted him to be
so, but there is no proof that Asoka was a Buddhist emperor at all. In
any case, in Theravāda Buddhist countries it is given for granted that
Asoka is the model of a ruler-patron.

Now, a superficial survey of the most dominant political ideas in the
Buddhist world today (2014), East and West, will reveal that the
favourite political system for the followers of this religion is
democracy (and I would say that, if possible, liberal democracy).
Tibetan Buddhist leaders are asking for democracy, Burmese Buddhist
leaders are asking for democracy, etc.

Perhaps there is no contradiction in this, because democracy represents
the political ideology of the actual empire of our times: the USA (and
NATO partners). It is generally assumed that democracy is the best
political system, at least in theory (but of course, in theory all
systems are the best…). It is frequently assumed, also, that a “free”
country has to be a democratic country.

Present day political leaders of confessed Buddhist background make
efforts to justify why democracy is the most suitable political system
in Buddhism, even though the Buddha was, in theory, apolitical or
beyond-the-political, and even though historically the idea of democracy
is absent in Buddhist literature of all schools. But still, some claim
that we have to consider the spirit, and not in the letter, of Buddhist
literature, and thus we will discover democracy at the very heart of
Buddhist political thought.

One of these leaders cum theoreticians is the Nobel Prize laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi, a.k.a. “The Lady”. Thanks to Suu Kyi, the Pali Tipiṭaka has
made an unexpected appearance in the contemporary international
political arena. According to Suu Kyi, we have a proof, in the
*Aggaññasutta* of the *Dīgha Nikāya*, that, according to Buddhism,
Democracy is the best and the only legitimate system. She is referring,
of course, to the legend of the *Mahāsammata*, “the great elected”–a
legend that is found in that sutta. In her well-known book *Freedom From
Fear* (1991) Suu Kyi wrote:

> This \[i.e. Buddhist primaeval monarchy of the Great Elected\] has

In other words, because the primeval king was elected with the favour of
the people, even though he was a king, the political system was
democratic. This may sound appealing to those who are wish to find
modern ideas in Buddhism, or to those who want to see the Buddha as the
greatest precedent of 18^(th)-century Enlightenment in Europe.

If someone reads the *Aggaññasutta* in its entirety, however, he or she
will probably notice that there is nothing in there that reminds us of
democracy. Some could say: “It’s a matter of interpretation”. It may be,
but I really doubt we have much room for interpretation. Some scholars
(e.g. R. Gombrich, S. Collins) consider this discourse as a satire of
Brahmanical cosmologies, an example of the sublte irony of the Buddha,
who was able to reverse moral values of the oponents using their own
narrative strategies, symbols, myths, etc. If that is true, Suu Kyi’s
interpretation would look even stranger. But I will grant that the
Buddha is actually talking seriously.

The *Agaññasutta* begins with two brahmins (Vāseṭṭha and Bharaddāja)
visiting the Buddha. They have become Buddhist monks and are being
scolded by brahmin relatives and acquaintances, who keep telling them
that the brahmins are the best, the rest of the castes are degenerate,
and it is not fitting for a brahmin to mix with outcasts. The Buddha
then tells an ancient tale about the evolution of a universal era, from
beings made of light to normal, flesh and bone humans fighting for
possessions, food and territory (this “myth” is not exclusive of the
*Agaññasutta*, it is already referred to in the *Brahmajālasutta*, for
instance). In order to prevent chaos, a great king is elected by the
people, he is the *Mahāsammata* “the Great Elected”, the original king,
the one with the monopoly of violence, to put it in Weberian terms. A
very conspicuous interpretation of the sutta can be found at its end of
the discourse, when the Buddha says:

> Vāseṭṭha, it was Brahmā Sanankumāra who spoke this verse:
>
> *The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan;*
>
> *He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.*
>
> This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly,
> connected withprofit, not unconnected. I too say, Vāseṭṭha:
>
> *The Khattiya’s best among those who value clan;*
>
> *He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men.*

The main question in the *Agaññasutta* is to know which *varṇa* “caste”
(?) is the best one. The solution is offered in the quoted passage:
*kṣatriyas* (the army) are the most important *varṇa*, because they
guarantee social peace and stability (this reminds us more of the
Burmese military-junta discourse…).

Second conclusion of the sutta: Among religious (apolitical) people, the
“knowledgeable” are the best (understand: even if they are not
Brahmins). That is, I think, the whole point of the *Aggaññasutta*.

And if we move now to another important text, the *Mahāvaṃsa* (Book IV),
the classic Buddhist chronicle of the Theravādins in South and Southeast
Asia (i.e. the tradition Suu Kyi allegedly follows), we will see how,
indeed, the legacy of the Mahāsammata was everything but democratic. It
was, according to ancient Buddhists, a regular monarchy, a lineage of
blood, not of merit. Even the Buddha Gotama himself was a descendant of
this primaeval *kṣatriya* (“warrior”).

All that being said, we could ask wherefrom comes this fever of some
leaders to demonstrate that Democracy is not contradictory with Buddhist
political philosophy. Sometimes Democracy is used as a synonym of social
justice, but the spirit of Democracy is lost in favour of more
traditional ideas that tend to correspond with what I said in the
beginning, namely that the favourite political structure for Buddhists
has always been the Empire (a Dhamma Empire, of course). Let us only
consider the silence of Suu Kyi regarding the massacres of the Rohingya
muslims. Or, for instance, what a Burmese student leader, Min Ko Naing,
said back in 1988, when during the protests against the Burmese
dictatorship he was asked about the greatest obstacle to democracy:

> As you know, Min Ko Naing can only conquer a bad king. If the ruler
> is good, we carry him on our sholders.

Hans Bernd Zöllner, a German scholar who has devoted an entire volume to
the relationship between the military-junta and Suu Kyi, has synthesised
the problem in this line:

> “Democracy” was thus synonymous with everything other than the
> current government, which was not trusted.

I think this is a good starting point for the discussion.
