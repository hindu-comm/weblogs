Possible applications of Mīmāṃsā deontics: on Chaudhuri and Vardi

There are fields in which the contribution of applied ethics and
deontics are more than needed, such as that of the programming of
artificial intelligence connected to robots which might interact with
human beings. Chaudhuri and Vardi (their article can be downloaded
[here](http://popl-obt-2014.cs.brown.edu/papers/ethics.pdf)) quote the
following case:

> Once released on our streets, self-driving cars will almost certainly
> face circumstances where they just cannot avoid harming a human.  
> It is thus imperative that the new generations of intelligent machines
> be not just efﬁcient or functional but also *ethical*.

A case which might appear even closer to readers of this blog is that of
softwares needing to handle the allocation of resources. These need to
receive several bits of information, but to neglect some of them (e.g.,
“membership in a political party”), while taking into account others
(e.g. “academic ability”, which Chaudhuri and Vardi do not explain
further).  
Now, all these issues do not only need the help of ethicists who are
willing to engage in the elaboration of appropriate programs, but also
of deontic logicians. Consider the following example, again from the
same article:

> \[W\]hat if a drone in a battleﬁeld is obligated to ensure *p*, but it
> is impossible to ensure *p*? Is the drone still required to fulﬁll its
> other obligations? The answer should presumably be yes. However, note
> that this is a departure from classical \[deontic, EF\] logic, where
> the impossibility to meet *p* would amount to an inconsistency,
> rendering moot every other consideration.

This entails the need to elaborate a deontic logic which is no longer
bound to the limits of [Standard Deontic
Logic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-deontic/#2) and, for
instance, values differently different obligations, so that a failure to
accomplish a minor obligation does not make the system collapse. This
consideration would already be enough to make researchers curious about
deontic systems developed outside the Lutheran tradition (it might be
worth remembering that deontic logic started in the West in Scandinavia
and has until now been primarily developed in Northern Europe and the
US) and thus entailing, most probably, different biases, so that the
combination of various systems could pave the way for the creation of a
more comprehensive one, able to process different sorts of conflicts. It
is in this connection perhaps not surprising that the authors of this
article are both coming from outside the precincts of the majority of
scholars working on deontic logic (respectively, from India and
Israel).  
On top of that, there are specific reasons to want to come closer to the
Mīmāṃsā deontics, since it precisely entails a hierarchy of
prescriptions/obligations (see the comments to
[this](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/03/07/do-you-think-that-sanskrit-is-hard-have-a-look-at-what-our-fellow-logicians-are-doing-on-srinivasan-and-parthasarathi-2012/)
post).

Now, a different question: **On which side does it depend that
programmers and logicians interact so little with historians of
philosophy?**
