Karma: The Lecture

Here is a link to a lecture on *karma* that I give in my Introduction to
Asian Religions course at The University of Calgary.

This is also a topic that I’m writing some papers on, with the hope of
eventually writing a book. I start by presenting what I refer to as Karl
Potter’s interpretation of *karma*, according to which *karma* can be
analyzed in terms of *samskaras* – habits or dispositions to repeat
actions in the future. I contend that this kind of analysis is
widespread. I offer two objections to this account. At the end of the
lecture, I revise the account to handle the objections. I take this
revised account to *roughly* resemble the account that Roy Perrett
outlines in his *Hindu Ethics*. Needless to say, more objections await.
Any feedback is welcome.
