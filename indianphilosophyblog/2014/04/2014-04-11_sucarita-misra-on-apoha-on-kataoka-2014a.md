Sucarita Miśra on apoha —On Kataoka 2014a

Who is the most productive scholar on Indian Philosophy? Kei Kataoka is
surely in the top-10 (have a look at his publications
[here](http://www.k4.dion.ne.jp/~sanskrit/WorksJ.html)).

He has just published a critical edition of the *apoha* section of
Sucarita’s
[commentary](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2013/01/kumarilas-commentators.html)
on the *Ślokavārttika*. The text is available only in manuscripts, so
that this article is a precious addition to our knowledge of Sucarita.
On top of that, as usual, Kataoka’s work displays his knowledge of many
schools of Indian philosophy (Nyāya-Vedānta-Mīmāṃsā-Buddhist
Pramāṇavāda) and of their interactions in the second half of the first
millennium.

More in detail, he reconstructs how Vācaspati (probably, I would add,
since there is always the chance of a shared background of live
discussions, what I call “interlanguage”) derived some of his
anti-*apoha* arguments from Sucarita:

1.  First, both Sucarita and Vācaspati follow Kumārila in starting their
    rebuttal of apoha by questioning its locus (*āśraya*, “reference” in
    linguistics). If this is a *vikalpa* ‘unreal conceptual
    construction’, then how does it come that I keep on understanding
    the same thing when I hear the word “cow”? If the reference is as
    ephemorous as an erroneous concept, the meaning of the word should
    change without interruption. Kataoka’s argument is strengthened by
    the fact that Jayanta, the other early-but-post-Dharmottara opposer
    of apoha, uses a different strategy.
2.  both Sucarita and Vācaspati note that *apoha* cannot at the same
    time express something positive (*vidhirūpa*) while only being a
    conceptual construction (*kalpita*). Here Kataoka is on a less sure
    ground, given that the problem of the contrast between the negative
    nature of *apoha* and the fact that it seemingly expresses positive
    (*vidhirūpa*) entities had already been noted by Jayanta (NM,
    apohadūṣaṇa, sections 2 and 3.1 of Kataoka’s edition), but it is
    also true that Jayanta does not juxtapose *vidhirūpa* and *kalpita*.
3.  Last comes an interesting point. Sucarita and Vācaspati agree in
    describing Dharmottara’s position as descriving the word-meaning as
    something conceptually constructed and ultimately false (*alīka*).
    However, in a later passage Vācaspati uses a more complex term,
    namely *alīkabāhyatva*. This might be an evidence of the fact that
    Vācaspati was following Sucarita (and not the other way round), but
    incorporated a term which had just been introduced in the debate
    (possibly by Jñānaśrīmitra, who speaks of *āropitabāhyatva*).

This last point is convincing as for the relative chronology of Sucarita
and Vācaspati, but I must admit that I am not sure I understood what is
*conceptually* at stake in this terminological change. Does it mean that
Sucarita is just speaking of the *apoha* as false, whereas Jñānaśrīmitra
speaks of this falsity as appearing as if it were external? If so, then
this seems to be just another way to state Dharmottara’s
[position](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2012/04/apoha-in-dharmottara.html)
that *apoha* is neither internal nor external, but rather an internal
construction which appears as if it were external (*kaścid āropita
ākāraḥ*). Jñānaśrīmitra and Vācaspati may have introduced a
terminological novelty, but I am not sure whether there was also a
conceptual novelty beyond it.

**Do you identify a development in the *apoha* theory after
Dharmottara?**
