Philosophy and Poetry? (A call for comparanda)

(I have not forgotten that this is an “Indian Philosophy” blog, in case
you are only reading the first sentence of this post…)

The question of how we “do philosophy” is central to Plato’s
*Protagoras*, where two models are on offer. There is the “sophistic”
model, where a teacher gives lectures on a given topic to a paying
audience. The topic is usually (and in the case of the *Protagoras*) the
interpretation of a poem. This model has two centers of authority: the
poet, who is believed to have some wisdom and more importantly some
cultural currency, and the sophist, who uses his own wisdom to explain
and critique the poet before his students. The other model is the
“dialectical” one, which Socrates favors, and which I don’t need to
explain in depth here.

Plato’s Socrates always prefers to philosophize dialectically, and at
one point says that philosophy can only really happen among serious
guys—no women, no music, and none of the “extraneous voices” of poetry.
But he says this after playing along with his opponent by offering a
sensitive and careful reading of the poem that Protagoras had suggested
for discussion (an ode of Simonides). Clearly Plato is a little
ambivalent about the role of poetry in philosophy: Socrates’
interpretation is really *pro forma*, and he makes it clear that we
can’t confine ourselves to the “wisdom of the poets” if we’re interested
in philosophical questions, but at the same time, he ends up making a
compelling philosophical point about the difference between “being good”
and “becoming good” through his interpretation of Simonides.

There is a particular juncture between poetry and philosophy that the
*Protagoras* critically discusses: the notion that poetry contains a
kind of wisdom which we can systematically “open up” and expand when we
interpret poetry in a philosophical context. The context is
philosophical by virtue of its overarching goals—a sophist teaching his
students about virtue, for example, or Plato composing a dialogue about
how philosophy should be practiced. **Do we have similar junctures in
Indian philosophy?** Are there cases in philosophical texts where a work
of poetry is made to do some important philosophical work?

Nothing quite comes to mind—but there are many examples of *different*
types of junctures between philosophy and poetry in Sanskrit texts, and
I’ll list a few here, both to exclude them from my call for comparanda
and to roughly sketch a typology of interactions between philosophy and
poetry (which partly overlaps with older typologies of interactions
between *śāstra* and *kāvya*):

-   Philosophical texts that are organized around the interpretation of
    a *verse* text, which is nevertheless not *poetry*. People who
    aren’t familiar with Indian literature are liable to confuse “verse”
    and “poetry,” whereas no Indian author that I know of ever
    considered the *Sāṃkhyakārikā*s (for example) to be a work of poetry
    (*kāvya*).
-   Vedic citations, for instance those that appear in the
    *Paspaśāhnika* of Patañjali’s *Mahābhāṣya*. These definitely
    contribute toward making a (arguably philosophical) case for the
    study of grammar, but again, Patañjali wouldn’t have considered the
    Vedas to be poetry (*kāvya*). (I am willing to bend a little on this
    point.)
-   Poetic texts that are rich in philosophical content, which is
    however not systematically elaborated in a philosophical context.
    The commentaries to works of poetry sometimes elicit these
    philosophical meanings, but I am looking for a less “occasional”
    investigation, something more like Appayya Dīkṣita’s
    *Rāmāyaṇatātparyasārasaṅgrahastotra*.
-   I should also note, in connection with the last point, that I don’t
    consider works like the *Bhagavadgītā* or the*Bhāgavatapurāṇa* to
    be “poetry” for these purposes. They have certainly attracted lots
    of interpretive attention. But I am more interested in the
    philosophical exploitation of the “wisdom of poets” (to use David
    Shulman’s
    [phrase](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Poets-Studies-Sanskrit/dp/0195652371))
    than in the elaboration of what is already taken for granted to be
    god’s own truth.
-   Works of poetry that are straightforwardly meant to represent or
    inculcate already-systematized philosophical ideals. This excludes
    (perhaps invidiously: I am also willing to bend on this point) most
    of the “didactic” literature of Buddhists and Jains.
-   Poetry does play a major role in philosophical aesthetics: think of
    Abhinavagupta’s citation of the verse, from the beginning of the
    *Śākuntala*, where the deer cranes its neck in fear
    (*grīvābhaṅgābhirāmam*…). But this is exactly what we would expect,
    since such verses are what philosophical aesthetics is supposed to
    account for.

Needless to say, if this does turn out to be a gap in the literature—and
not just in my exposure to it—it is not a *censurable* gap, since there
are many ways of doing philosophy, and we shouldn’t expect the same
inventory of approaches in all traditions.
