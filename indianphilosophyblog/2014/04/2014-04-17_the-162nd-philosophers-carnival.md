The 162nd Philosophers’ Carnival

The most amusing version of the Philosophers’ Carnival I know of is
[here](http://www.aestheticsforbirds.com/2014/04/philosophers-carnival-162.html?m=1)!
With a reference to Jonathan Edelmann’s piece on Theology and Philosophy
in the Indian context which you can read [on our
blog](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/03/07/philosophy-and-theology-lets-be-clearer/).

The next edition of the Philosophers’ Carnival will be published on this
blog, don’t forget to submit your favourite posts (by you or by anyone
else in the blogosphere) written in April,
