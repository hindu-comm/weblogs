Mukulabhaṭṭa and pragmatics in Indian philosophy–a Guest Post by Malcolm Keating

Hello, everyone—Matthew asked me to write a guest post on some of my
work on Mukulabhaṭṭa and pragmatics in Indian philosophy. I’d be
interested in everyone’s thoughts!

Mukulabhaṭṭa was a ninth-century Kashmiri thinker who wrote a critical
response to Ānandavardhana’s important Dhvanyāloka. Mukula’s only extant
work, the Abhidhāvṛttamātṛkā (Fundamentals of the Communicative
Function) is a study of literal and non-literal meaning, but his work
straddles genre boundaries, including recognizably alaṃkāra-śāstra
themes within a broader epistemological and linguistic framework. His
work, though influential for Ālaṁkārikas who follow him, such as
Mammaṭa, has not been given significant attention by modern scholars
until relatively recently, most notably in Larry McCrea’s “The Teleology
of Poetics in Medieval Kashmir.”

**Lakṣaṇā as Removing Apparent Incompatibility**

\(1\) “*gaur vāhīka*.” (“The peasant is a bull.”)

\(2\) “*gaṅgāyam ghoṣaḥ*.” (“The village is on the Ganges.”)

\(3\) “*pīno devadatto divā* *na bhuṅkte*.” (“Fat Devadatt does not eat
during the day.”)

According to Mukulabhaṭṭa, all of these expressions have something in
common: their full meaning is understood through lakṣaṇā, often
translated as “indication.” In his *Abhidhāvṛttamātṛkā*, he argues
against Ānandavardhana’s view thatwe need suggestion (dhvani) in order
to account for these meanings.

In my current work, I am especially interested in the relationship
between *lakṣaṇā* and *arthāpatti*. Mukula claims that (3), which is a
standard instance of *śrutārthāpatti*, is also a case of *lakṣaṇā*.
Throughout his text, Mukula explains how lakṣaṇā removes apparent
incompatibilities as in (3). Unlike Ānandavardhana’s view of *lakṣaṇā*,
however, he thinks that the apparent incompatibilities need not only
exist between component words in a sentence. Rather, there are multiple
contextual facts: speaker, sentence, utterance, as well as the place,
time, and circumstance.

**Lakṣaṇā and IBE, arthāpatti, and Grice**

What is of interest to me is the way in which interpretation through
*lakṣaṇā* is analogous to the sort of inference to the best explanation
which drives Gricean pragmatics. In fact, looking at H.P. Grice’s
original definition of conversational implicature (which, of course, has
had many emendations and objections over since its first publication),
its structure is strikingly similar to *arthāpatti*

S conversationally implicates that q in saying that p iff S implicates q
when:



1.  S is presumed to be observing the conversational maxims (or the
    Cooperative Principle),
2.  The supposition that S thinks that q is required to make saying that
    p consistent with this presumption,
3.  S thinks, and expects H to think that S thinks, the hearer can work
    out or grasp intuitively, that the supposition that q is required.



Inference to the best explanation (which I distinguish from abduction)
can be defined as below (Mackonis 2013):



1.  The surprising fact, C, is observed;
2.  But if A were true, C would be a matter of course.
3.  No available competing hypothesis can explain C as well as A does.
4.  Hence, A is true.



Finally, arthāpatti as defined by Kumārilabhaṭṭa in the *Ślokavārttika*:

When an object is known through the six pramāṇa, which otherwise could
not be, another, unseen object is imagined—this is an example of
*arthāpatti*.

*pramāṇa-ṣaṭka-vijñāto yatra artho na anyathā bhavet;adṛṣṭaṃ kalpayed
anyam sa-arthāpattir udāhṛtā.*

Grice’s #2, (although he uses the unfortunate term “consistent” which
cannot be, strictly speaking what he means) points at the idea that the
role of a conversational implicature q is to explain p against a
background set of assumptions which includes #1, the CP. In the schema
of IBE, q is equivalent to A, and p is equivalent to C. In the schema of
*arthāpatti*, the *adṛṣṭam* is the conversational implicature which
removes the apparent incompatibility between, for instance, the
speaker’s utterance and background knowledge.

In the case of Devadatta, what is implicated is that Devadatta eats at
night. It is surprising that a fat man would be this way without eating
during the day, and so we conclude that he must eat at night. In the
case of the peasant, where it is surprising that a speaker would
identify a human being with an animal (Mukula points out that “peasant”
and “bull” cannot have the same qualifying substratum), we presume that
there is a metaphorical meaning. In the case of the village on the
Ganges, it is suprising that a speaker would use the locative case for
Ganges, since we know villages cannot be supported by rivers, so we
conclude that she must be speaking metonymically and by “on the Ganges”
she must mean “on the bank of the Ganges.”

**Some Questions**

If I am right that this general interpretive structure is characteristic
of lakṣaṇā, which involves arthāpatti, then Mukula has a highly flexible
and context-sensitive alternative to Ānandavardhana’s proposal of a new
*śakti*, in addition to denotation and indication. However, it also
raises several questions.

1.  In discussing frozen or conventional metaphors (the word ‘*rājan*’
    applied to non-*kṣatriya* rulers), Mukula notes that it’s possible
    to retrace the relationship between a literal meaning and a
    non-literal meaning through reflection (vicāraṇa) even if people do
    not actually go through a reflective process ordinarily. To what
    degree are interpreters expected to be able to calculate the
    relationship between literal and non-literal meanings? Or, related,
    to what degree, ought we be able to reconstruct such a relationship,
    and in what cases (note the Gricean distinction between conventional
    and conversational implicatures—does *lakṣaṇā* reject such a
    distinction, and why)?
2.  What makes a given interpretation the best one? Mukula says the
    interpretation for (3) that Devadatta drinks is blocked (*badhita*)
    because nighttime is mentioned. How strong is this defeater? Could
    there be two equally strong interpretations?
3.  Mukula often uses “*ādi*” to fill out the list of metaphorical
    content—the peasant and the bull both have dullness, laziness, and
    so on. If arthāpatti is the underlying pramāṇa by which hearers come
    to understand what is meant, should its deliverances be determinate?
    If so, what particular list of things counts as understanding the
    metaphor? If we do not come to understand a determinate proposition,
    then how should we understand lakṣaṇā in comparison to denotation
    and the other traditional śakti? Is this evidence that
    Ānandavardhana was right about suggestion in some way?
4.  Finally, a larger question is about the relationship between the
    pramāṇas of testimony, inference, and arthāpatti. If speakers
    sometimes utter non-literal sentences with the goal of conveying
    knowledge, how do their hearers come to have *niścaya*, or warrant,
    in what is communicated?
