General and specific rules in Mīmāṃsā?

What happens when commands clash? A standard devise to deal with the
topic is the idea of taking one as a general rule and the other as a
specific one. In Sanskrit, these are called, respectively, utsarga and
apavāda. Mīmāṃsā authors have, however, other devices.

For instance, Kumārila, discusses the prohibition to perform violence
and its seeming conflict with the ritual prescription to perform ritual
killing within a given sacrifice.  
See his Commentary in verses (*Ślokavārttika*), chapter on Injunction
(codanā), vv. 223—224:

तेन सामान्यतः प्राप्तो विधिना न निवारितः \|\|  
फलांशोपनिपातिन्या हिंसायाः प्रतिेषेधकः \|  
“Therefore the prohibition to killing, obtained in general applied and
not stopped by another injunction, prohibits the killing when it
pertains to the fruit-portion \|

Is this a case of a general rule overturned by a specific one (as
claimed in Kei Kataoka 2012, *Is Killing Bad?*)?

If it were so, we would have the general prohibition to perform violence
(F(violence)/T) being overruled by the more specific obligation to
perform ritual killing in a specific setting:  
F(violence)/T  
O(violence)/sacrifice for Agni and Soma

However, this is not the solution adopted by Kumārila. Rather,
Kumārila’s point is that the original prohibition to perform violence
should be reconfigured as a prohibition regarding only violence as the
result of the action, and not regarding instrumental violence.

That is, according to Kumārila, the Vedic prohibition to perform
violence should not be read as  
F(violence)/T  
but as  
F(violence as a result)/T  
which does not conflict with (instrumental violence)

Comments, as usual, welcome!
