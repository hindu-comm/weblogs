This volume is a systematic and comprehensive introduction to one of the
most read texts in South Asia, the*Bhagavad-gītā*.
The*Bhagavad-gītā*is at its core a religious text, a philosophical
treatise and a literary work, which has occupied an authoritative
position within Hinduism for the past millennium.

This book brings together themes central to the study of the Gītā, as it
is popularly known – such as the*Bhagavad-gītā*’s structure, the
history of its exegesis, its acceptance by different traditions within
Hinduism and its national and global relevance. It highlights the
richness of the Gītā’s interpretations, examines its great interpretive
flexibility and at the same time offers a conceptual structure based on
a traditional commentarial tradition.

With contributions from major scholars across the world, this book will
be indispensable for scholars and researchers of religious studies,
especially Hinduism, Indian philosophy, Asian philosophy, Indian
history, literature and South Asian studies.
