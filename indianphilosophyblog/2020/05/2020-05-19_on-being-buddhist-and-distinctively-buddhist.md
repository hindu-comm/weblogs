On being Buddhist and distinctively Buddhist

[At the start](http://loveofallwisdom.com/?p=4777) of my replies to
[Evan Thompson’s
response](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2020/04/25/clarifying-why-i-am-not-a-buddhist-a-response-to-amod-lele-guest-post-by-evan-thompson/),
I noted that there are two core ways in which my eudaimonist Buddhist
modernism differs from a great deal of premodern Buddhist tradition. I
will first address the one that I take to be a deeper modification to
the tradition, in admitting goals [beyond the removal of
suffering](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/).
Thompson doesn’t speak of this modification in quite these terms, but I
think many of his comments speak directly to it. Especially, Thompson
says:

> I submit that the driving engine—historically and philosophically—of
> Buddhist thought is the following set of propositions: All conditioned
> and compounded things are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self

> everything conditioned and compounded is impermanent; everything

> devoid of self; and nirvāṇa (unconditioned cessation of affliction) is
> peace.

I don’t agree that these propositions constitute *the* driving engine of
Buddhist thought; that would be a very strong claim, one which Thompson
does not argue for. I do, however, think that they are *among* the more
important parts of Buddhist thought historically. Indeed I think they
are *so* important that on this blog, eleven years ago, [I described
them](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/09/zest/), or something like
them, as the biggest reason I *wasn’t* a Buddhist –much as Thompson
does. At that point I stood with him on that question; I don’t anymore.

What changed? [I’ve told that
story](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/05/i-am-a-buddhist/):
sitting in the waiting room of a cancer clinic, I suddenly realized that
if I was to have a chaplain to help me face death, I would want that
chaplain to be Buddhist. That was for a number of reasons, but
significant among them the Buddha’s own recognition of the inevitability
of death (in the *sutta*s), with his last words, “strive with vigilance”
– strive to be better. That depended neither on a God I couldn’t believe
in, nor on an advocacy of social justice that can do nothing in the face
of death’s inevitability. All this was crucial to me because – as with a
therapist –for a chaplain to help a patient, the patient has to provide
the chaplain with trust, even *faith*. A good chaplain will challenge us
on exactly those views that are making it hard for us to live the last
parts of our lives well.

Now Thompson says in his response:

> I have no objection to anyone who feels more at home with Buddhist
> conceptions of virtue, and of wholesome versus harmful emotions, than
> with analogous conceptions in other traditions (Stoicism,
> Christianity, Confucianism, etc.), who accordingly wishes to
> articulate virtue ethics mainly from the evolving perspective of the
> Buddhist philosophical tradition, and who thus identifies as a
> Buddhist.

This indicates to me that Thompson would find relatively little to
object to in my adoption of Buddhism as I’ve described it so far. Where
I think his objections would lie is to the *next* part of my adoption of
Buddhism. That is: Nothing that happened in the hospital waiting room
changed my belief that rebirth is false, *or* that the things of this
world can be worthy of our pursuit. I had not then, and have not now,
seen any Buddhist arguments that dissuaded me from these views. I think
that then leaves me three options. First, I could exit Buddhism on the
grounds that I cannot believe propositions traditionally important to it
– an existentially unsatisfying option in the context, and one that
would likely exclude membership in nearly any tradition that exists
(including secular humanism and Unitarian Universalism). Second, I could
accept two mutually contradictory ideas at the same time –an approach
completely unacceptable for a philosopher, and [not great for ordinary
people either](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). Or,
I could attempt to adhere to a Buddhism that remained true to these
other philosophical convictions of mine – which would therefore not
include most of the propositions Thompson identifies. That is the option
I chose, and I continue to think it the best.

I also think that my resulting worldview remains distinctively Buddhist
in a variety of ways: rejecting righteous anger, believing (with the
Second Noble Truth) that the causes of suffering are primarily mental,
[seeing political action as
dangerous](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/the-political-path-vs-the-buddhist-path/),
and more. Thompson, however, doesn’t think that the rejection of
righteous anger counts as distinctively Buddhist (and this in a way that
would probably apply to other related propositions). He notes in
response that “ancient and modern Stoics also regard anger as a
destructive emotion that needs to be curbed and counteracted by positive
emotions and rational understanding.” That’s true. But to say that the
rejection of righteous anger is therefore not distinctively Buddhist
implies a standard for “distinctively Buddhist” that I don’t think is
fair. In saying that the rejection of righteous anger is “distinctively
Buddhist” I meant that it passes something like [David Chapman’s
standard](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/09/does-it-matter-what-we-call-buddhist/)
of something “not already understood by (say) a non-Buddhist
college-educated left-leaning Californian” (or Bostonian or
Vancouverite) – something that challenges the common sense that what
left-wing North Americans were already inclined to believe anyway, which
I think [Thompson and I agree](http://loveofallwisdom.com/?p=4777) is an
important thing for Buddhism to do. What is distinctively Buddhist in
this way is what is challenging rather than comfortable.

Thompson’s remarks, by contrast, appear to be setting a much higher
standard for an idea to be “distinctively Buddhist”: that there are or
have been *no other traditions that ever advocated it*. This, I submit,
is an impossibly high standard. I think that most of what Thompson takes
to be the “driving engine” of Buddhist thought would fail it. Augustine
would have wholeheartedly agreed that the things of this world
–conditioned and compounded things –are impermanent and
unsatisfactory, and that true well-being is found in an unconditioned
peace beyond it. The Hellenistic Skeptics, and even many contemporary
postmodernists, would agree that “all phenomena are devoid of self”.
Very few propositions are *unique* to any tradition, and I don’t see any
reason to expect them to be. I think a tradition’s distinctiveness is
important not for any sense of uniqueness, but for a way it offers
challenges to the common sense of the age (and so what is distinctive
about a tradition may change from era to era).

In the next post I’ll explore at more length why I reject the kind of
propositions Thompson notes above, and what that means.
