Because Time is not Self : On Ānandajñāna’s refutation of Kāla

**Abstract**

The conversation between Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika (NV) and Advaita Vedānta (AV)
philosophers attract intellects because it is somehow the ancient
version of the realist versus idealist debate which is currently
prevalent and relevant. Gauḍapāda in his Māṇḍūkyakārikā attempts to
refute the very basis of realism, i.e., time and the law of
causation[^(\[1\])](#_ftn1). Śaṅkara in his commentary on Brahmasūtras
attempts to refute other philosophies including Vaiśeṣika
(V)[^(\[2\])](#_ftn2). The method of refutation is Vitaṇḍā (Vi), where
one doesn’t put forward one’s own views, but only points out logical
faults in those of the opponent. Using this method, Śrīharṣa composed
his Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya and Citsukha his Tattvapradīpikā, where both of
them attempt to refute NV philosophies. A similar text, thought to be
later than both, Tarkasaṅgraha (TS) was composed by Ānandajñāna or
Ānandagiri, in 13th century CE[^(\[3\])](#_ftn3), where he attempts to
refute the complete V philosophy in detail. Instead of just refuting the
major categories like Dravya alone, he took up the task to refute
definitions of each and every Dravya. The concept of Kāla (K) being
fundamental to NV, any refutation of it is bound to affect the whole
system of it. A reply to his refutation has been given by
Śeṣaśārṅgadhara around 15th to 16th centuries CE[^(\[4\])](#_ftn4), in
his commentary titled Nyāyamuktāvalī (NM) on Udayana’s Lakṣaṇāvalī (LA).
The source of TS is the book ‘Tarkasaṅgraha of Ānandajñāna’, published
under Gaekwad’s Oriental Series in the year 1917, edited by T. M.
Tripathi. The source for NM is the book the ‘Lakṣaṇāvalī of
Udayanācārya’, edited by Surendralāla Gosvāmin, published in 1900.

**On Vitaṇḍā**

It is defined in the Nyāyasūtras (NS) as a style of debate where one
doesn’t establish one’s own thesis[^(\[5\])](#_ftn5). Vātsyāyana in his
commentary on the NS adds that a Vaitaṇḍika or practiser of Vi only
refutes the opponent’s thesis[^(\[6\])](#_ftn6). Hence, in Vi, the
debater has to only refute the thesis of his opponent without declaring
or establishing his own. However easy it may sound, Vi requires a
debater to be thoroughly acquainted with the opponent’s thesis. For
example, if Ānandajñāna has to refute V philosophy, he must first gain
adequate acquaintance with the V philosophy. In this manner, although
done for other purposes, the background preparation of Vi ensures the
preservation of a certain philosophy or śāstra which may be completely
refuted in the future and lose all authority. Texts like Nyāyalīlāvatī
(NL) of Vallabha and Khaṇḍanoddhāra of Vācaspatimiśra II show that after
being refuted, the philosophers of NV philosophies made attempts to
improve their thesis in order to protect it from further refutations. In
this way, the conversation between NV and AV philosophers indirectly
contributed in the gradual improvement of both philosophies.

**On the Vaiśeṣika concept of Kāla**

In his Vaiśeṣikasūtras (VS), Kaṇāda categorises K as a
Dravya[^(\[7\])](#_ftn7), which is inferable from the notions of
priority with regards to posteriority, of simultaneity, of delay and of
quickness[^(\[8\])](#_ftn8). Praśastapāda says in his
Padārthadharmasaṅgraha (PS) that K is inferable from the cognitions of
the aforesaid types[^(\[9\])](#_ftn9). Vallabha in his Nyāyalīlāvatī
(NL) defines K as that padārtha which is the auxiliary of the relation
of differences of solar movements and objects[^(\[10\])](#_ftn10).

**Ānandajñāna’s (Ā) refutation of Kāla and analysis**

His refutation can be divided into different stages. Stage 1 is based on
the cognitions of priority and posteriority etc., stage 2 is based on
the cognitions of simultaneity and non-simultaneity etc., stage 3 is
based on the inferability of K from such cognitions, stage 4 is based on
the solar movements, stage 5 is based on inferability from specified
farness etc., stage 6 is about upādhi, and stage 7 is based on some
conception of prakṛti and puruṣa.

Ā begins with a very simple definition of K and keeps adding components
and attempts to show the faults. The process is as follows –

Stage 1

-   Nimitta of cognitions of nearness etc. > Applies to Dik (D) also.
-   Nimitta of cognitions different from those of D > Applies to Dharma
    etc., because they’ve been accepted as nimitta
    causes[^(\[11\])](#_ftn11).
-   ‘Dravya’ as a specification of the nimitta > Applies to Īśvara
    (Ātman), which is a potent dravya.
-   ‘Uniqueness’ as a specification > Opposes the accepted idea of K
    being nimitta of the origination of all those which are born or
    utpattimat[^(\[12\])](#_ftn12). The word ‘all’ implies that
    everything which is an effect, has for its origin D and K as nimitta
    causes. This way both become a shared nimitta cause of all effects.
    It would imply that both would become nimitta causes of the
    cognitions of nearness etc. which are different from those of D. So
    being a shared cause, K couldn’t be called a unique cause for the
    production of such cognitions.

Stage 2

-   K as one out of many nimittas of cognitions of simultaneity,
    non-simultaneity, quickness and delay > Applies to Adṛṣṭa also,
    because it is one of many nimittas in every activity. The expression
    ‘one of many’ confirms that there are other nimittas also. And
    uniqueness not being compatible with the aforesaid V idea of D and K
    being shared nimittas for all effects, calling K as the unique
    nimitta for such cognitions would be impossible.
-   Q. Do those cognitions have one and the same object as basis (K)? If
    yes, it would lead to impossibility of difference between various
    definitions of kṣaṇa, lava, nimeṣa etc., and words like simultaneity
    would become synonymous. Kṣaṇa, lava, nimeṣa etc., all mean K, or
    point to K and not something different from K. So they’re not
    fundamentally different from K, and hence there own differences
    wouldn’t be fundamental in nature. If upādhis create differences, it
    has been dealt with in stage 4 refutation.
-   Q. Are those cognitions based on more than one entity or an entity
    different from K? Aforementioned definitions wouldn’t apply.

Stage 3

-   K is inferable from such cognitions.
-   Q. As a samavāyin cause? Not possible because K is not Ātman, and as
    cognition or buddhi is a guṇa of Ātman, so it has Ātman as its
    samavāyin cause[^(\[13\])](#_ftn13).
-   Q. As an asamavāyin cause? Not possible because K is taken to be a
    Dravya and something which is an asamavāyin cause cannot be a
    Dravya.
-   Q. As a nimitta cause? Q. As a viṣaya or non-viṣaya of our senses? K
    is nityānumeya or eternally inferable or that which cannot be
    directly perceived and hence always inferred. So it cannot be a
    viṣaya of our senses. Being a non-viṣaya, a K different from Adṛṣṭa
    etc. is unestablished. Because if it is a non-viṣaya, we cannot
    directly perceive it as being different from the other existing or
    inferred entities, specifically when it is neither a samavāyin cause
    or an asamavāyin cause. For example, we can directly perceive a pot
    as being different from a cloth. One could say that there are many
    entities like Īśvara which are eternally inferable, and so this
    fault is not reasonable. Īśvara and Adṛṣṭa being both eternally
    inferable are still being thought about as being two separate
    entities with two separate functions. But in the case being
    discussed, the V K has not been able to prove itself as any
    different from Adṛṣṭa etc. which are nimitta causes, and so if it
    too is the same, according to the parsimony principle or lāghava, we
    could simply explain the said cognitions by Adṛṣṭa etc. without
    invoking a separate entity, the separateness and uniqueness of which
    is not being able to be proved through the existing definitions and
    arguments.
-   If the specific cognition of simultaneity is being called the cause
    of specific cognition of ‘pots are simultaneously arising’, Ā says
    that this cognition of simultaneity is K alone, and although such
    cognition could cause such other cognition, it cannot cause the
    production of pots. If a cognition, which is internal or mental,
    could cause something external, it would lead to idealism, which is
    opposed to the realists of V philosophy.

Stage 4

-   K produced from the superiority and inferiority of solar movements,
    as it conforms to it, like a pot to its potter.
-   Solar movement itself has a unique cause, because it is an effect,
    like a pot.
-   Solar movement is a action, and V action does not have any attribute
    or quality[^(\[14\])](#_ftn14), while here superiority and
    inferiority (which are qualities) of solar movement are being talked
    about. So it goes against the V idea of attributelessness of action.
-   If they are defined as different from K, K being yet to be
    established, the definition has the fault of mutual dependence
    between the definer and the definable.
-   The idea of conformity does not apply to the example itself, where a
    pot and a potter can exist independently of each other after the
    creation of the pot.
-   There is no natural connection between the solar movements and
    old-young bodies.
-   No delimitorness (avacchedakatva) is present which is independent of
    such a connection, because it needs some connection as a
    prerequisite.

Stage 5

-   K being inferable from specified farness, etc.
-   Q. What is specified farness? If it is ‘not being a product of
    Deśa’[^(\[15\])](#_ftn15), it opposes the idea of D and K both being
    nimitta causes of the production of all that is born. This common
    attribute opposes the specification, and so both could be held
    responsible for cognitions of both D and K, also because cognitions
    are produced.
-   If it is ‘being a product of K’, it incurs the fault of mutual
    dependence as K itself is yet to be established.
-   K isn’t a unique cause of such cognitions, as has been said earlier.
-   Being only a connector of variations of solar movements with the
    bodies, K does not create cognitions of temporal farness etc.
-   Such a connection can be equally explained by the omnipresent
    Cetana, due to which the whole sequence of the effect (cognitions)
    can be explained, and so imagining another dravya named K, is
    unnecessary. Although Cetana (Ātman) possesses viśeṣa guṇa, it is
    omnipresent and because of being conscious it is different from
    dravyas ranging from pṛthivī to ākāśa and this difference could make
    it a unique cause of such cognitions.
-   K is also not the basis of the divisions of K from kṣaṇa to
    mahāpralaya, because the terms kṣaṇa etc. mean K, and hence there is
    the fault of self-dependence. If they mean something else, then the
    usage of them could not denote K.

Stage 6

-   The difference of past, present and future placed in
    K[^(\[16\])](#_ftn16).
-   Q. Why not take that difference as the cause of cognition of K?
-   Both NV and AV agree on the different movements of the sun, which
    could create upādhis from which usage of K could be explained, so
    imagining a separate K would go against the parsimony principle.
    Taking an already accepted existing entity to explain an existing
    phenomenon, is more economic than to imagine a separate entity for
    the same purpose.[^(\[17\])](#_ftn17)

Stage 7

-   K as a conjunction of Puruṣa and Prakṛti[^(\[18\])](#_ftn18).
-   Being a conjunction it cannot be a Dravya because conjunction is a
    quality.
-   If it is identical with either Puruṣa or Prakṛti, it can’t be
    conjunction.
-   If it is identical with Prakṛti, being of the form of illusory māyā,
    V K can’t be established.
-   If it is identical with Puruṣa, V K can’t be established as an
    independent entity. It could simply be either called Puruṣa or a
    quality or function of Puruṣa.
-   If another Prakṛti is accepted, same fault.

**Refutation of Ā’s refutation by Śeṣaśārṅgadhara (Ś)**

Stage 1

-   Against the vyabhicāra in Adṛṣṭa etc., he opines that K is the
    nimitta of not paratva and aparatva etc., but of ‘niyata’ paratva
    and aparatva etc.[^(\[19\])](#_ftn19)
-   This is due to K being a unique cause of those, and this uniqueness
    is that K connects (bodies with) the originator of such cognitions,
    which is solar movement[^(\[20\])](#_ftn20).
-   Against Ātman or Ākāśa being such a cause, he seems to repeat the
    words of Līlāvatīkāra Vallabha, that both would cause an attribute
    of one thing to be applied on another such thing which is far far
    away, just because Ātman and Ākāśa are
    omnipresent[^(\[21\])](#_ftn21).
-   Ā has already dealt with the point that even when one specifies the
    temporal farness etc. as different from directional farness etc.,
    and if K is defined as a nimitta of the cognition of the former,
    there is still vyabhicāra in dharma etc. Ś instead picks up on the
    fourth point of Ā where he refutes uniqueness of K as a cause
    towards those cognitions. So according to Ā, even calling K as the
    nimitta of cognitions of ‘niyata’ paratva and aparatva doesn’t
    separate K from all other categories. Also, such cognitions too are
    utpattimat or produced, and so both D and K would become their
    common nimitta causes, which would lead to the superfluity of the
    addition of the word ‘niyata’.
-   It has been well recognised by the likes of Udayana and Vallabha
    that there is no direct relation between the variations of solar
    movements and the bodies on earth. The minimum requirement for a
    viśiṣṭa usage is the perception of a delimitor and a delimited,
    which can only happen if there is a relation between two
    entities[^(\[22\])](#_ftn22). In stage 4, Ā deals with the issue of
    solar movements, and points out that the hetu of
    one[^(\[23\])](#_ftn23) of the anumānaprayogas is itself sādhya and
    so is causing the fault of sādhyāviśiṣṭatva, and that in the
    other[^(\[24\])](#_ftn24) prayoga, the hetu doesn’t apply to the
    dṛṣṭānta causing the fault of sādhanavikalatva. It is worth noting
    that Ś doesn’t quote and refute this passage of TS.
-   With regards to saying that Ātman cannot do what K can, both Udayana
    and Vallabha, and also Ś do not seem to consider that although Ākāśa
    and Ātman are both vibhu or omnipresent dravyas, Ātman unlike any
    other dravya is conscious. Being conscious, and having ‘cognitions’
    as an attribute given to it by the V philosophers themselves, it can
    produce the aforementioned cognitions by direct relation. In this
    way the principle of parsimony or lāghava too shall be adhered to.

Stage 2

Ś takes the same point of uniqueness to prove that there is no
vyabhicāra in Adṛṣṭa etc. To Ā’s argument that if the cognitions are
same as K, there individual different definitions wouldn’t apply, Ś says
that in vikalpas, anekārthatva or ‘having many objects as basis’ is
accepted[^(\[25\])](#_ftn25), but does not explain why it is accepted.
In case of K, the various divisions are imagined upon a singular K of
the V philosophy. Hence, it may be a workable solution to think of those
divisions as having their origins in something slightly different from
the singular K. Then Ś takes to the Ā’s point that if those cognitions
are different from K, their definitions again wouldn’t apply. To this Ś
says that even in that case, the senior V philosophers accept such
definitions[^(\[26\])](#_ftn26), but doesn’t explain as to why. To Ā’s
point that those cognitions are the same as K, Ś responds that a single
K has been accepted which according to different upādhis is taken to be
different[^(\[27\])](#_ftn27). The point of upādhis is connected with
the solar movements.

Stage 3

On the point of inferability of K through the cognitions of nearness
etc., Ś’s response can be judged from the
anumānaprayoga[^(\[28\])](#_ftn28) he gives; ‘nearness etc. are effects
of non-inherent cause, because of being bhāva-effects, like pot’. Here
the hetu ‘because of being bhāva-effects’ or ‘bhāvakāryatvāt’ could be
applied to everything other than ‘nimittakāraṇamātrajanya’ or ‘that
which is produced only by an instrumental cause’, because abhāva-effects
have been said to have only nimittakāraṇa[^(\[29\])](#_ftn29). So one
could also say, ‘nearness etc. are produced by water, because of being
bhāva-effects, like pot’[^(\[30\])](#_ftn30). Although the prayoga
adheres to the correct format, but does not prove anything. If it does
prove, then the prayoga of Ś and the latter should both be correct. The
further discussion by Ś being based on this prayoga, doesn’t seem to
stand on a valid ground. Also, calling K an asamavāyin cause goes
against the V definitions of K calling it a nimitta cause.

Ś refutes stage 1 of Ā by refuting one of Ā’s refutations on the basis
of an idea which has been refuted by Ā in stage 4. The stage 4
refutation has not been responded to by Ś. Ā’s stage 2 refutation has
been refuted by Ś not by arguments but by showing what is accepted by
the senior V philosophers. Ā’s stage 3 refutation has been refuted by Ś
through an anumānaprayoga which seems to be faulty.

**Additional remarks**

The stage 4 refutation of Ā seems to be based on the concept of K and
the arguments in its favour advanced by Udayana in his Kiraṇāvalī
(Ki)[^(\[31\])](#_ftn31). The stage 3 refutation seems to be based on a
possible refutation mentioned by Udayana in Ki[^(\[32\])](#_ftn32),
which has probably been elaborated by Ā[^(\[33\])](#_ftn33). The Ā’s
version of that refutation is mentioned by Vallabha in his Nyāyalīlāvatī
(NL)[^(\[34\])](#_ftn34). It cannot be said for sure who came up with
that idea first. But it is interesting to note that while the major
portion of Citsukha’s refutation of K in his Tattvapradīpikā (TP) is
based on the ideas mentioned in NL[^(\[35\])](#_ftn35), Ā’s refutation
of K is majorly based on Ki. In his commentary on Udayana’s LA titled
NM, Ś mentions both Citsukha[^(\[36\])](#_ftn36) and Ā, which somehow
shows their impact on the V system even way later than their times, that
is, around 15th to 16th centuries CE. Although Ā doesn’t directly
mention Udayana in his refutation in TS, he has mentioned his name in
his text Tattvāloka[^(\[37\])](#_ftn37) (TL) which he had composed
during his pre-saṃnyāsa life as Janārdana. In TL, the refutation of K is
very small keeping in view the definitions of K. But in TS it is very
detailed. Even then, the question arises, why did not Ā mention LA’s
definition of K[^(\[38\])](#_ftn38) in TS? It could also be that LA came
later than TS and specifically as a result of improving the NV
definitions and hence protecting them from further refutations. If
Udayana had already come up with the improved definition of K before TS,
or simply during his authoring of Ki, he could’ve mentioned it in Ki.
Like Śaṅkaramiśra mentions his definitions while commenting upon the
sūtras of Kaṇāda, so could’ve been done by Udayana also. If that is
true, Ā and Udayana[^(\[39\])](#_ftn39) (10th to 11th centuries CE)
would be contemporaries, unlike the latter being earlier than the
former. Or else, the Udayana of LA and that of Ki are two different
persons.
