Mīmāṃsā Ritual Theory Applied:  “Ricelihood: A Tale of Livingness and Rice Beings in Northern Thai Ricelihood”

This past Monday (November 23), I have had an opportunity to participate
in the performance titled, **“Ricelihood: A Tale of Livingness and Rice
Beings in NortherThai Ricelihood,”** which is a part of a dissertation
project of my colleague and friend, Sirithorn Siriwan. Siriwan is a
Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Asian Studies, Cornell University.
Her research is an ethnographic and creative research on rice rituals
along with their emotional, aesthetic, and ontological aspects.
According to Siriwan, rice rituals used to be an essential part of lives
in agricultural areas like***Mae Cham*, a district of Chiang Mai in
northern Thailand**, where she is conducting her research. People
and*rice beings or entities*were sustained through rituals and rites
of passage related to rice. However, the industrialization of rice
farming and rice fields has damaged both people and rice, leaving behind
only residuals in rice fields and rendering rice rituals useless and
irrelevant to the ways of rice and living.

Combining anthropology, ritual studies, and theater studies, she
produced a ritualized performance titled “Ricelihood” that narrates the
past and fading stories of rice rituals and ways of living, interwoven
with rice, for the people in the area.***Ricelihood*refers
to*livingness*or lives and ways of lives of both rice and people who
are engaged with rice cultivation, culture, and rituals.** She intends
to use the performance to regenerate the*livingness*by telling,
retelling, and enacting the residual experiences.

There are countless studies of rice and rice rituals in Thai academia
and elsewhere, but her project and performance are innovative and
uniquely engaged with human and non-human entities. Before the
performance, I and my friend had a spontaneous and long conversation on
the motivation and transformative mechanism of the performance. We were
thinking about how such a performance can actually change the situation
and bring back lives? And how can we explain it in a more concrete
manner? The conversation soon turned into a discussion on global
philosophy when my friend brought in*new materialism*, while I was
trying to rationalize her explanation and add to the depth of the
conversation with***Mīmāṃsā*ritual theory**, which was more familiar
to me. I want to share with you here the seedness of our conversation.

First of all, I understand that a ritualized dramatization gives rise to
two features of*ricelihood*. The first one consists of lives and ways
of living. On the other hand, “Ricelihood” is the performance, as
Siriwan named it. In other words, the performance presents both action
and a message for the audience to do something. **In this regard, I
understand that the performance has the same function as an imperative
statement or injunction gives rise to the desire to
restore*ricelihood*.** Following a Mīmāṃsā paradigmatic injunction,
“The one who desires heaven should sacrifice” (*svargakāmo yajeta*), in
this case, we might think of a statement, saying “The one who
desires*ricelihood*should perform” (something like*odanajīvanatvakāmo
yajeta*?).

**Then, what type of rituals one is enjoined to do with such an
injunction?**

To give some background, the Mīmāṃsakas divide rituals, especially
sacrificial rituals, into three types. The first type is obligatory
(*nitya*) rituals which one has to perform as long as one lives. The one
who fails to perform a ritual would accumulate sins and will not obtain
the desired results. The second type is occasional (*naimittika*)
sacrifices which are to be performed on a special occasion such as when
a son is born. The last one is desired-based (*kāmya*) sacrifices which
one performs according to one’s desire. Some rituals
like*agnihotra*can be categorized as obligatory or desired-based since
it is done for the first time due to the desire for heaven and then
turns into something obligatory.

**I interpret the performance as enjoining an obligatory ritual
since*ricelihood,*as Siriwan’s project claims, has to be continuously
sustained, and the failure to do so would entail damages.** One could
use the*agnihotra*ritual as a model in this scenario. The performance
is indeed intent on a particular desire when it is undertaken first.
However, once one desires*ricelihood*, one has to keep performing rice
rituals to generate*ricelihood*so that it lasts.

Mīmāṃsā ritual theory gives us a way to better understand how the
performance “Ricelihood” as a ritual aims at potentially planting the
seed in peoples’ minds and revitalizing rice cultures and communities in
Thailand, despite the difference in temporal and geographical contexts.

about “Ricelihood.”**
