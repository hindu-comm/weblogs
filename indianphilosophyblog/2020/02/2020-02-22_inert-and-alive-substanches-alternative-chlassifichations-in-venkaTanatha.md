Inert and alive substances: Alternative classifications in Veṅkaṭanātha

In the *Nyāyasiddhāñjana* and the *Nyāyapariśuddhi*, Veṅkaṭanātha
discusses some fundamental ontological topics in order to distinguish
his positions from the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika position.

The *Nyāyasūtra* proposes a fundamental division of realities into
*dravya* ‘substances’, *guṇa* ‘qualities’, and *karman*
‘actions’,[¹](#fn1) with the former as the substrate of the latter two.
This leads to two difficulties for Veṅkaṭanātha’s agenda. On the one
hand, the radical distinction between substance and attribute means that
Nyāya authors imagine liberation to be the end of the connection of the
*ātman* ‘self’ to *all* attributes, from sufferance to consciousness. By
contrast, Veṅkaṭanātha, would never accept consciousness to be separated
from the individual soul and even less from God. The other difficulty
regards the theology of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta. Since the beginnings of
Pañcarātra, one of its chief doctrines has been that of the
manifestations (*vibhūti*) of Viṣṇu, which are dependent on Him but
co-eternal with Him and in this sense are unexplainable according to the
division of substances into eternal and transient.

To that, Veṅkaṭanātha opposes more than one classification, so that it
is clear that Veṅkaṭanātha’s main point is addressing the
above-mentioned problems with the Nyāya ontology, rather than
establishing in full detail a distinct ontology.  
For an instance of alternative classifications see, e.g.,
Nyāyasiddhāñjana, jaḍadravyapariccheda:

> dvedhā jaḍājaḍatayā pratyak taditaratayāpi vā dravyam \| ṣoḍhā
> triguṇānehojīveśvarabhogabhūtimatibhedāt \|\|
> dhīkālabhogabhūtīravivakṣitvā guṇādirūpatvāt \|  
> jīvātmeśabhidārthaṃ tredhā tattvaṃ viviñcate kecit \|\|
> (Nyayasiddhanjana 1966, p. 33).
>
> “Substance is of two types, \[according to this classification:\]
> inert or alive, or \[according to this other classification:\] innerly
> \[luminous\] or what is its opposite. \[Furthermore,\] it is of six
> types, according to the division in \[natura naturans having\] three
> qualities, time (anehas) individual souls, God, the ground for
> \[God’s\] enjoyment (bhogabhūti) and \[His\] cognition. Some
> distinguish reality as of three types, in order to distinguish the
> Lord, the individual soul, and the self (as the material cause of the
> universe) because they do not want to include (lit. express)
> cognition, time and the ground for \[God’s\] enjoyment, since these
> have the nature of qualities”.

Bhogabhūti must mean, out of context, the same as vibhūti. My
interpretation of ātman in jīvātmeśabhidartham is also based on context.
**Alternative suggestions are, as usual, welcome!**

    There are in fact further categories, namely *sāmānya* ‘universal’,
    *viśeṣa* ‘individual’, and *samavāya* ‘inherence’. See for the fact
    that these latter categories have been added at a later stage of the
    evolution of the school. The Navya Nyāya school adds also *abhāva*
    to the categories. (see Eli Franco and Karin Preisendanz,
    “Nyāya-Vaiśeịṣika”, Routledge Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy)[↩︎](#fnref1)
