Post-Doc Fellowships in Global Philosophy of Religion

We received from Yujin Nagasawa (via Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad):

I am starting a new Templeton-funded project called the Global
Philosophy of Religion (https://www.global-philosophy.org/). The aim of
the project is to promote research involving philosophers of religion
from all religious traditions and geographical regions. As part of the
project, we are advertising three postdoctoral fellowships – in Hindu
philosophy of religion, Islamic philosophy of religion and Jewish
philosophy of religion – as well as a senior lectureship in philosophy
of religion (tradition unspecified).

The list of the positions are published here:
<https://www.global-philosophy.org/vacancies>

I would be most grateful if you could forward it to people who may be
interested in any of the positions.
