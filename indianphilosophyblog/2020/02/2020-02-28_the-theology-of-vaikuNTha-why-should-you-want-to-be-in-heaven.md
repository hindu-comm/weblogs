The theology of Vaikuṇṭha: Why should you want to be in heaven?

We all know so many clever jokes about how hell should be preferred
“because of the good company” and about how boring should heaven be. Let
me take the chance to focus on the Śrīvaiṣṇava heaven, i.e., Vaikuṇṭha,
and see whether they apply also to it.

First, some **history of the concept** (move to next paragraph if not
interested):  
The name Vaikuṇṭha is used for both a particular form of Viṣṇu (with
four faces) and for the Vaiṣṇava heaven. Please notice that we are not
talking of one among many heavens, but the only and upmost one, where
God’s bhaktas can live with Him. The first usage seemingly predates the
other (since it is attested in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and in the KauśUp
for Indra and in MBh and Harivaṃśa for Viṣṇu). Vaikuṇṭha for the place
is attested in the Bhāgavata and in the works of the Āḻvārs.  
Did the two usages influenced each other? Possibly, but I could not yet
reconstruct the missing links (**any help is appreciated**).

Vaikuṇṭha is mentioned just once in the early three Tiruvantātis of the
Divyaprabandha (or Tivyappirapantam), namely by the **Āḻvār** called
Pēyāḻvār. The text is translated as follows by Eva Wilden (with Marcus
Schmücker):

> “As in all earlier times Vēṅkaṭam, the milk ocean \[and\] Vaikuntam
> were the temples for him who took \[them and\] dwelled there, \[so now
> is\] Kaṭikai, with lush flowers in long groves where a wealth of bees
> rises, the heavenly city for the young prince.”

In Tamil (separation among words and breaking of some sandhis mine,
based on the book’s transcription):

> பண்டெல்லாம் வேங்கடம் பாற் கடல் வைகுந்தங்  
> கொண்டங்கு உறைவார்க்குக் கோயில் போல் —வண்டு  
> வளங் கிளரும் நீள் சோலை வண் பூங் கடிகை  
> யிளங் குமரன் தன் விண் நகர். (2342)

Conceptually it is interesting to notice that Vaikuṇṭha is mentioned as
the place in which Viṣṇu resided, like the milk-ocean and Vēṅkaṭam. Now,
unless I am wrong, there is no (Skt or Tamil) mention of the devotees of
God being able to reside in Vēṅkaṭam or in the milk ocean, so this first
mention of Vaikuṇṭha seems to list only places of Viṣṇu, with no hint of
the fact that one of them will become also the heavenly abode of His
devotees.

A possible alternative reading is suggested by Eva Wilden herself, who,
based on a linguistic problem, writes in a footnote:

> “Slightly disconcerting in this verse is that we have one designation
> for the lord in line 2 which makes use of the honorific form
> (uṟaivārkku), while line 4 refers to him as a prince in masculine
> singular (kumaraṉ). We might consider reading uṟaivārkku instead as a
> slightly elliptical reference to his devotees who take (perceive;
> koṇṭu) Vēṅkaṭam, the milk ocean and Vaikuntam as his abodes and dwell
> there to do worship, but that, while working nicely for Vēṅkaṭam, is
> somewhat more difficult to imagine for the latter two places.”

I am not completely sure I can follow Wilden’s argument here, since I
would imagine that the ideal place for the devotees to dwell and do
worship were Vaikuṇṭam, but anyway, the suggestion is interesting, since
it points to the possibility of reading the first part of the verse as
describing the places in which the devotees visualise Viṣṇu.

Later on, the **Āḻvārs** discuss of Vaikuṇṭha as if it were the only
place one might want to reach –no mention of liberation, either as an
alternative (and possibly lower) goal or as identical with Vaikuṇṭha.

**Why exactly is Vaikuṇṭha such a great place?** As pointed out already,
for the Āḻvārs the main reason seems to be that one is in the same world
with one’s beloved One. Veṅkaṭanātha adds some more theology to it,
speaking of the fact that one does not only share *sālokya* ‘being in
the same world \[with God\]’, but also paramasāmya ‘supreme identity
\[with God\]’. This last state seems to violate exactly the residual
dualism necessary in order to allow for love and service to God, and it
is possible that Veṅkaṭanātha only included it because of the Muṇḍaka
Upaniṣad passage about it (*nirañjanaḥ paramam sāmyam upaiti*, 3.1.3).
Therefore, Veṅkaṭanātha explains that this *paramasāmya* is not
*tādātmya* (as for the Advaitins), but rather *sādharmya* ‘having the
same characteristics’. Still, the person having attained *sādharmya* is
not equal to God in every respect. For instance, they cannot create the
world. So, the *sādharmya* regards other aspects, most notably
*bhogasāmya* ‘equality of enjoyment’. In other words, one enjoys all the
blessing experiences of God in Vaikuṇṭha, although one does not have the
same level of independent agency (but still a lot of freedom, according
to Tattvamuktākalāpa 2.63).

The idea of equal enjoyment with God raises the problem of embodiment,
since it seems difficult to imagine enjoyment without a body.
Veṅkaṭanātha in the TMK says that in fact the soul can at their own will
get a body, which is not determined by karman and is therefore not a
vehicle of bondage.

Within the *sādharmya* there is also the attainment of omniscience,
which in fact was the natural condition of the soul but was temporarily
blocked by karman. (So, in Vaikuṇṭha you will finally be able to
understand perfectly Tamil and Sanskrit and solve any philosophical
puzzle you wondered about!)

Why should it not get boring at a certain point? Veṅkaṭanātha does not
directly address this question, but his *Rahasyatrayasāra* seems to
point to the idea that one would be busy with a continuous flow of
beautiful experiences, all connected with the fact that one is with nice
people (the other liberated ones) and especially with the object of
one’s love, Viṣṇu.

**Does it sound convincing? Or would one still eventually get bored?**  
Eternity is long… Yes, but one might also speculate that during cosmic
dissolutions everything is reabsorbed in Viṣṇu, so that eternity is long
but always interrupted. I will get back to this in future posts.
