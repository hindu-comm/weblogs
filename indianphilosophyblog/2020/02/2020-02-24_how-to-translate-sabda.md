How to translate śabda?

When philosophers and translators approached Ferdinand de Saussure’s
theory of *langue* vs *parole*, they initially thought of translating
parole with ‘word’ or its various synonyms in many languages. The
problem is that parole can mean ‘word’, but that in French there is a
more specialised word for that, namely *mot*. *Parole* can mean ‘word’
only if we are non-technical, but it would be hard to claim that a
philosopher of language like Saussure was not technical in his
terminological choices!  
Now, I think that the same story, mutatis mutandis, applies to the case
of *śabda* in Sanskrit philosophy of language. *śabda* can mean ‘word’,
for instance as the second member of a compound in expressions like
*dharmaśabdaḥ prītyarthaḥ upayujyate* (the word dharma is used in the
sense of ‘happiness’). However, there is a more specialised term for
‘word’, namely *pada*, and *śabda* has a way wider field of application,
including:  
—*śabda* as an instrument of knowledge  
—*śabda* as any linguistic unit, ranging from phoneme to word to
sentences, according to context  
–*śabda* as sound, especially in Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika.  
In other words, ‘word’ is at best imprecise and at worst misleading.
What can one do instead? In some cases, one needs to add something, but
I think it is fair to keep a shared element in all translations. I, for
one, think that language/linguistic work best in this sense. I therefore
use “linguistic communication” or “linguistic communication as an
instrument of knowledge” for *śabda* in the sense of *śabdapramāṇa*.
What to do when *śabda* is used to cover any unit of language, be it a
phoneme, a word, a sentence, a textual passage? I used to use
“linguistic expression” or “linguistic unit”. What do you think?

**Alternative proposals**  
Recently, a colleague wrote me he could not understand what “linguistic
expression” means. **Do you?**  
I also read the comment of a colleague telling me that “linguistic
expression” is too technical. This is true. But, the point is, Sanskrit
philosophy of language *is* technical. It is not at all an easy reading
meant for relaxing times. Would you want to tell a phonetician they
should stop speaking of “fricatives” because it is too technical?

Alternative proposals count ”speech unit” and ”speech” for *śabda* in
some cases, then ”verbal cognition” in others and so on. But I am afraid
that ”speech unit” cannot cover sentences and other bigger chunks of
language and that in general it is too closely connected to the phonic
representation of language (whereas *śabda* could cover also unspoken
but thought linguistic expressions). As for ”verbal”, I like it, but the
corresponding noun (verb) has now a different meaning in English and
might therefore be misleading.

(I am grateful to Elliot M. Stern for disagreeing with me and forcing me
to spell out my reasons)
