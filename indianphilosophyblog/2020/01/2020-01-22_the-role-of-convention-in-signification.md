The role of convention in signification

In his Seśvaramīmāṃsā ad 1.1.12, Veṅkaṭanātha explains that the example
of proper names does not prove that language in general depends on
convention. He writes that the case of proper names is not a
dahanadṛṣṭānta, possibly ‘an example which sets on fire \[the whole
theory\]’.

Why so? Because

In other words, convention, as an auxiliary of intrinsic signification,
plays a role, but only in the case of proper names. And the distinction
is possible based on one’s experience of linguistic expressions, insofar
as linguistic expressions which are not proper names are immediately
grasped as significant by people who know the language. By contrast,
they might have doubts when they encounter proper names of unknown
places or people.

These are, as usual, my thoughts only. **Should you have a different
understanding, you are welcome to share it.** I would be happy and
grateful to read it.

\*(The editions add a च after प्रकृते, which makes the connection with
the previous sentence unclear. The manuscripts provide a better reading,
without the च).
