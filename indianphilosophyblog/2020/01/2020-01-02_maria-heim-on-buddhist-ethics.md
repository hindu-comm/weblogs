Maria Heim on Buddhist Ethics

Maria Heim just published a short book on Buddhist ethics, which starts
with the problem of the non-existence of ethics in South Asian
philosophy in general and in Buddhist philosophy in particular. She then
moves to moral reflections within the dimension of Buddhist practice.
The book includes a comparison of Buddhaghosa’s and Śāntideva’s
teachings and is freely available online until January the 7th. You can
download it
