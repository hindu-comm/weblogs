Reparations, expiations and prāyaścittas

Mīmāṃsā authors distinguish broadly between prescriptions (vidhi) and
prohibitions (niṣedha). The first ones are linked with a result, so that
if one has fulfilled them, they get a reward. The latter, if respected,
don’t lead to any result, whereas they lead to sanctions if
transgressed.

Prescriptions are further divided into three groups (fixed, occasional
and elective). The first two groups are configured as strong obligations
(leading to rewards if fulfilled, but omitted only at the risk of
sanctions), whereas the latter are configured as recommendations. As for
prohibitions, they are divided into prohibitions applying to the person
throughout their lives and prohibitions applying only to a specific
context.

Next comes the somehow controversial case of reparations or expiations
(prāyaścitta). These are in fact contrary-to-duty prescriptions. Such
prescriptions have as their addressee someone who did some- thing wrong
during the performance of a sacrifice; therefore, they can be taken to
be contrary-to- duty (ctd) prescriptions.

Expiations can be used to eliminate the negative consequences of a
transgressed prohibition. That is, after having performed the
corresponding expiation, a transgressed kratvartha prohibition does no
longer lead to a negative output on the sacrifice, and a transgressed
puruṣārtha prohibition does no longer lead to a sanction. In
Dharmaśāstra (jurisprudence) texts, for instance, authors discuss
expiations to be performed after having transgressed the duty to live in
Āryāvarta (the part of South Asia where nobles people live and where
liberation can be achieved).

There seems, however, to be a basic difference between the first and the
second type of expiations, since the first ones seem to be routinely
performed in case of contextual errors. By contrast, the second type of
expiations seems to be an undesired alternative. In other words, more
research is needed, but it is possible that puruṣārtha expiations are of
this form:

F (p) → ¬ p ∨ p ∧ Expiation

By contrast, puruṣārtha expiations seem to have this form:

F (p) → ¬ p ∨ p ∧ Sanction ∨ Expiation ∧ Lesser Sanction

Mīmāṃsā and/or Dharmaśāstra?
