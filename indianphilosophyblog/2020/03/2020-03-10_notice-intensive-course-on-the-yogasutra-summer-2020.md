Notice: Intensive course on the Yogas큰tra, Summer 2020

From ElizabethDe Michelis:

Dear Colleagues,

[AMRAY](http://www.amray-association.org/), of which I am one of the
managers, would like to advertise to suitable candidates an intensive
course on the Yogas큰tra that will take place in France this Summer
(mid-June to mid-August 2020). The course will be taught by Dr Michel
Angot and will be based on the Sanskrit text of the Yogas큰tra and its
main commentaries. The philological part of the course will consist of a
minimum of 6 hours of daytime lectures , with evening sessions dedicated
to recitation of Sanskrit texts.

The course is currently fully booked, but AMRAY has provisionally
reserved a couple of places specifically for allocation to philologists
who may be able to attend. Suitable candidates should (1) be keenly
interested in this text and (2) have the necessary linguistic skills,
i.e. medium to advanced knowledge of Sanskrit and fluency in French
and/or Russian, the course languages (please note no English).

AMRAY may be able to offer some level of sponsorship to suitable
candidates should that be needed. Interested parties should contact me
at <asso.amray@gmail.com> as soon as possible, and by 10 April at the
latest in order to discuss further details.

Please feel free to circulate this message to any suitable candidate who
may not be on this list.

With all good wishes,  
Elizabeth De Michelis
