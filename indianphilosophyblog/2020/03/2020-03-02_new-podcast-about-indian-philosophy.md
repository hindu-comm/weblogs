New podcast about Indian Philosophy

I’ve started a biweekly (in the sense of every other week) podcast about
Indian philosophy, called *sutras* *(and stuff)*, which is being hosted
at [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/malcolm-keating/) and has a website
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/sutras-and-stuff/). In the coming
week, it should be distributed to other podcast platforms like Spotify,
Apple, and so on.

Here’s the podcast description: “*Sutras (and stuff)* is a podcast that
gives you bite-size morsels of South Asian philosophy, paired with
contemporary topics. Its basic theme is that there are always
connections from the present to the past, even across cultures and
languages. You don’t need to know anything about Sanskrit or India to
listen, just to be curious about how what’s new might be connected to
what’s old.”

It’s intended for a general (not academic) audience, hence the omission
of the diacritical mark in *sūtra*. The first episode is about sūtra
literature and Twitter, and the next scheduled show focuses on
figurative language. I hope it’s interesting to some folks!

And if there are other podcasts people enjoy about Indian or South Asian
philosophy, perhaps add them in the comments? (I think we all know about
History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps, but here’s a link, anyway:
