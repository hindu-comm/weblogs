Why is Evan Thompson not a Buddhist? (1)

Recently [Evan Thompson](https://evanthompson.me/biography/) released a
book with the provocative title [Why I Am Not A
Buddhist](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300226553/why-i-am-not-buddhist).
The book is an interesting constructive exploration that draws heavily
on Thompson’s long background in the mind sciences as well as a deep
engagement with Buddhist studies and Indian philosophy and culture in
general. As such it is well worth a read. Perhaps not surprisingly
[given my own
identification](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/05/i-am-a-buddhist/),
however, I do not think its case against being a Buddhist is strong. In
a nutshell, Thompson makes at most a case against being one certain kind
of Buddhist, and there is a lot more of Buddhism to consider.

Why is Thompson not a Buddhist? He answers succinctly:

> Since I see no way for myself to be a Buddhist without being a
> Buddhist modernist, and Buddhist modernism is philosophically unsound,
> I see no way for myself to be a Buddhist without acting in bad faith.
> That is why I’m not a Buddhist. (19)

So Thompson identifies only two ways of being a Buddhist –and rejects
both. But I don’t think either rejection is sound. In both cases, he
provides reason to reject only a very small portion of what he actually
rejects. On the first: why can Thompson not be a non-modernist Buddhist?
A few pages before he dismisses the option in a sentence: “Since I
didn’t want to join a traditional Theravāda, Zen, or Tibetan Buddhist
monastery, the only way to be a Buddhist was to be a Buddhist
modernist.” (16) But such a claim would be startling to the millions and
millions of traditional Asian Buddhist laypeople who still constitute
the majority of professed Buddhists worldwide – and always have. They
are neither monks nor modernists. So not to join a monastery hardly
means that one cannot be a non-modernist Buddhist. (It also seems a
little question-begging to frame the decision in terms of not *wanting*
to join a monastery, since so much of the tradition identifies our
desires – our wants –as the heart of our problems.)

More could surely be said about that point, but the bulk of Thompson’s
critique is focused on Buddhist modernism, and I consider myself a
modernist Buddhist to at least some extent. So let us turn there. Notice
first that in Buddhist modernism as in other kinds of Buddhism, Thompson
explicitly ignores much of Asia:

> Although the context of my critique is Buddhism in the modern world,
> the scope of my critique is Buddhist modernism, or more precisely,
> Buddhist modernism in Europe and North America, since Asia is evolving
> its own unique forms of Buddhist modernism. My critical arguments
> apply to European and American Buddhist modernism, not to every form
> of Buddhism or Buddhism as a whole. (20-1)

But this will not do! If Thompson’s “critical arguments apply to
European and American Buddhist modernism”, then even if those arguments
are every bit as successful as he wants them to be, they will
necessarily still fail to show that “Buddhist modernism is
philosophically unsound”, since they will not have shown this about
Asian Buddhist modernism. Just as one can be a non-modernist Buddhist
without being a monk, one can *also* be a modernist Buddhist in a way
that –effectively by Thompson’s own admission –he has *not* shown to
be philosophically unsound.

Even within “European and American Buddhist modernism” (a curious
phrasing from someone who lives and teaches in Canada), the scope of
Thompson’s critique turns out to be quite limited. He defines Buddhist
modernism as “the modern and transnational form of Buddhism that
downplays the metaphysical and ritual elements of traditional Asian
Buddhism, while emphasizing personal meditative experience and
scientific rationality.” (15) But the actual critique he offers of
Buddhist modernism –what supposedly makes it philosophically unsound
–does not actually address a large portion of even the European and
American forms of Buddhist modernism thus defined (or the Canadian or
Australian).

Thompson says this of “Buddhist modernist discourse”:

> Its core tenets—that Buddhism is a “mind science”; that there is no
> self; that mindfulness is an inward awareness of one’s own private
> mental theater; that neuroscience establishes the value of mindfulness
> practice; that enlightenment is a nonconceptual experience outside
> language, culture, and tradition; and that enlightenment is or can be
> correlated with a brain state—are philosophically and scientifically
> indefensible. (188-9)

First of all, one of these tenets is not like the others. Most of these
tenets are framed in a modern Western vocabulary that classical Indian
Buddhists would not understand without significant translation work, and
distinguish modernist Buddhism – or rather a certain Western strain of
it –from the classical. But the tenet that there is no self, of course,
is nothing of the sort. That idea goes back thousands of years and
permeates the entire surviving Buddhist tradition, modernist and
otherwise. It has had countless philosophical defenders. It may well be
*wrong* –I go back and forth on it myself –but it is hardly
“indefensible”!

But leave that curious point aside. More importantly: the *other* tenets
on Thompson’s list are *not* the core tenets of “Buddhist modernist
discourse”, or even of “Western Buddhist modernist discourse” – even as
Thompson himself has defined it. They are core to just one strain of
Western Buddhist modernism, which Thompson calls “neural Buddhism” and
which he associates with writers like [Robert
Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Buddhism_Is_True) and [Alan
Wallace](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/buddhism-and-science/9780231123358).
Neural Buddhism takes the
[Wilberian](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2012/09/precis-of-beyond-enacted-experiences/)
position that the core of Buddhism is in the replicable experiences of
meditative practice, such that, as Wallace says, Buddhism’s “theories
have allegedly been tested and experimentally confirmed numerous times
over the past twenty-five hundred years, by means of duplicable
meditative techniques” –and, Wright and others claim, they are also
confirmed by modern neuroscience.

One sees why Thompson targets neural Buddhism, for it appears he once
believed it himself. Thompson says his earlier coauthored book [The
Embodied Mind](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/embodied-mind) had “argued
that cognitive science supports the Buddhist no-self view”, and now he
thinks things are more complex. (87) And Thompson’s critique lands most
strongly when directed at this view he once shared. He rightly claims:

> Contrary to neural Buddhism, the status of the self, the value of
> meditation, and the meaning of “enlightenment” aren’t matters that
> neuroscience can decide. They’re inherently philosophical matters that
> lie beyond the ken of neuroscience. (19)

I agree with Thompson on these points for the most part. But Buddhist
modernism, even within the West, goes well beyond neural Buddhism. That,
I think, is why Thompson’s critique of Western Buddhist modernism fails
to land. I will explain what I mean next time.
