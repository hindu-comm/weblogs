Notice: The Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation Subvention Program for First Books



From the website:

> 
>
> The Ludo and Rosane Rocher Foundation has created a program that
> provides subventions for the publication of “first books” by young
> scholars in the field of classical Indology. The scholars are expected
> to submit a CV, a book title, summary, and table of contents to the
> Foundation, with a list of potential publishers. These should be
> academic presses: either US university presses or the US offices of
> foreign academic presses, such as Oxford University Press. Upon
> preliminary approval, the author will send the full manuscript for
> review. The manuscript should be in publishable form, that is, one
> that the author sends to a publisher, in most cases a thoroughly
> revised dissertation. Once a book has been approved by the Foundation,
> it will provide a subvention of $ 5000 to the press that undertakes to
> publish it. It will be the responsibility of the author to find a
> suitable press. The published book must carry on the Copyright page
> the acknowledgment: “Published with the support of the Ludo and Rosane
> Rocher Foundation.” This program is intended to support young scholars
> in the early years of their postdoctoral academic life.
