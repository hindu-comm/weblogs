3AM interviews about Indian philosophy have moved

As [Patrick S. Oâ€™Donnell pointed
out](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2018/08/18/3am-interview-with-ramkrishna-bhattacharya/#comment-315628)
on a post about an interview with Ramakrishna Bhattacarya at [*3AM*
magazine](http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/), the interviews we linked to
a while ago are no no longer there. They have moved to *[3:16
am](https://www.3-16am.co.uk/)*.

In addition to the past
[interviews](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/category/interview/)
already mentioned on this blog, since the transition occurred to *3:16
am*, you will find new interviews with philosophers & scholars working
on Indian philosophy, such as [Maria
Heim](https://www.3-16am.co.uk/articles/buddhaghosa-immeasurable-words?c=end-times-archive)
and [Elisa
Freschi](https://www.3-16am.co.uk/articles/the-pr%C4%81bh%C4%81kara-m%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81-school?c=end-times-archive),
if you browse the
[index](https://www.3-16am.co.uk/articles/index-of-all-interviewees?c=index-of-interviewees).
I have not checked carefully, so there may be others I have missed.
