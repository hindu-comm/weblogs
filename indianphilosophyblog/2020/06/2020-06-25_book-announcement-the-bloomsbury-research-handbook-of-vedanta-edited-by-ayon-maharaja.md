Book announcement: The Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Vedānta, edited by Ayon Maharaj

![](https://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/f/9781350063235.jpg)

From the publisher:

“This handbook brings together a distinguished team of scholars from
philosophy, theology, and religious studies to provide the first
in-depth discussion of Vedānta and the many different systems of thought
that make up this tradition of Indian philosophy.  
  
Emphasizing the historical development of Vedāntic thought, it includes
chapters on numerous classical Vedāntic philosophies as well as the
modern Vedāntic views of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo, and Romain
Rolland. The volume offers careful hermeneutic analyses of how Vedāntic
texts have been interpreted, and it addresses key issues and debates in
Vedānta, including religious diversity, the nature of God, and the
possibility of embodied liberation. Venturing into cross-philosophical
and cross-cultural territory, it also brings Vedānta into dialogue with
Śaiva Nondualism as well as contemporary Western analytic philosophy.  
  
Highlighting current scholarly controversies and charting new paths of
inquiry, this is an indispensable research guide for anyone interested
in the past, present, and future of Vedānta and Indian philosophy.”

Contributors include Neil Dalal, Marcus Schmücker, Michael Williams,
Ravi M. Gupta, Jeffery D. Long, Stephen Phillips, Andrew J. Nicholson,
Ankur Barua, Klara Hedling, Francis X. Clooney, Daniel Raveh, Anand
Jayprakash Vaidya, Ethan Mills, Arindam Chakrabarti, and Ayon Maharaj.
