On delusions and their pragmatic efficacy

Continuing my [response to Seth
Segall](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/06/responses-on-humanity,-rebirth,-and-a-minimalist-model/),
my greatest disagreements are with his [second
point](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/endorsing-and-rejecting-the-views-of-the-modern-west/#comment-40961).
So I will begin by quoting that at length:

> As a hospital pastoral care provider I minister to patients of all
> faiths, and I have been impressed at how their faiths shape their own
> understanding of the virtues and contribute to making their lives
> admirable. So, if you are a person who finds a belief in rebirth
> compelling, and if you find that a belief in rebirth inspires you to
> practice being more compassionate to others, I have no quarrel with
> you. Please continue. The only statement I am willing to make without
> hesitation is that a belief in rebirth (let’s just use “rebirth” here
> as a stand-in for all the parts of Buddhism I happen to disagree with)
> doesn’t work for me, and I expect it won’t work for the majority of
> modern Westerners. I don’t want to be imperialistic about my beliefs.
> My attitude is, “this is what works for me,” and if you are feeling
> the same kind of dissonance with aspects of the Buddhist tradition,
> see if it works for you, too. On the other hand, I would never want to

I do recognize the importance of working with people as they are,
especially in a difficult field like pastoral care. Still I am nervous
about saying that false ideas – which I do take rebirth to be
–constitute “the best model for” any given person. Here I think it is
important to remember how classical Buddhist thinkers see our suffering
as rooted in ignorance, and the way out of it as requiring the clearing
out of delusion: seeing things as they are
([*yathābhūtam*](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/05/mere-convention-vs-seeing-correctly/)).
*Moha*, delusion, is as destructive a mental state as craving and anger.
So I think we must tread carefully when it comes to endorsing ideas that
are *false*. And I think Seth and I can agree that *some* ideas (that
the earth is flat, that vaccines cause autism) do fall into that
category.

There is indeed a longstanding Buddhist (and especially Mahāyāna)
tradition of *upāya-kauśalya*, “skill in means”, where one teaches ideas
that are false, or at least not strictly true, because they will be
spiritually beneficial to the recipient. The most famous example is the
[Lotus Sūtra’s story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya) of the man in
the burning house whose children aren’t persuaded to leave because of
the fire, so instead he tells them there are toys outside. But in the
end of the Lotus Sūtra story the man actually gives his children even
better toys, so what he said was barely even a lie at all. On the
question of whether one should actually tell falsehoods, or let others
live in falsehoods, for spiritually beneficial purposes, [the story is
something of a
cop-out](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/10/of-noble-lies-and-skill-in-means/).
It is still common in Mahāyāna tradition to say telling outright
falsehoods *is* acceptable in order to reach those of lesser spiritual
capacity – but even there, one needs to be clear to oneself that they
*are* falsehoods. Delusion is never a good thing; allowing people to
remain in delusion for their own benefit is, at best, a second-best
approach. Given the depths to which human delusion can reach, allowing
people to remain so is often important and even essential for their
well-being, and I do grant that. But we should still acknowledge it for
what it is.

I do not take the Dalai Lama to be infallible. If he believes things
that are false, that is a *problem.* Can certain delusions lead people
to better and more virtuous lives? Yes, under some conditions, and it
may often be the case that letting people live in those delusions is
more helpful than trying to cure them. But that remains a dangerous line
to walk. Virtue-generating delusions can easily turn to be
vice-generating. I could use as an example the fact that some Buddhists
have advocated against government antipoverty programs on the grounds
that poverty is karmically deserved. It is harder to argue against such
people if one has already granted that their false beliefs about rebirth
are fine because they “work for” them.

I must further admit a deep, and increasing, hostility to the use of
terms like “imperialism” to describe an advocacy of true beliefs against
the false. “Imperialist” is a pejorative (at least in the contemporary
context), and one that I find entirely unmerited in cases like the ones
under discussion. Seth’s comment here seems to suggest that merely to
advocate for truth over falsehood counts as “imperialism”. Is it
“imperialist” to deny the truth of the flat earth? How about the truth
of climate denial? Anti-vaxxing? If this is “imperialism”, then truth
requires imperialism, imperialism is an appropriate way to conduct
ourselves, and everyone should be an imperialist. Now since
misinterpretations on claims like these can easily get blown out of
proportion these days, let me be clear that I intend that previous
statement as a *reductio ad absurdum*: of course none of these latter
claims about imperialism are true. For that reason, advocating for truth
is *not* imperialism, and we must stop calling it that. If there is any
place where my disagreement with Seth is categorical and absolute, it is
on that point.

Truth matters; it matters that people see things as they are. I grant
that there are many cases where it is pragmatically effective for people
to remain in delusion, but we must at least be clear to ourselves that
it *is* delusion. Given [Stevenson’s kind of
evidence](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/06/responses-on-humanity,-rebirth,-and-a-minimalist-model/),
I could grant, for now at least, that perhaps – *perhaps* – rebirth as
such is not a delusion. But as far as I can tell, ethicized or karmic
rebirth – for which Stevenson &co. provide no such evidence – *is*. It
may be helpful and even necessary to others to allow others to remain in
delusion about it, but we must still be clear to ourselves that that is
what it is.
