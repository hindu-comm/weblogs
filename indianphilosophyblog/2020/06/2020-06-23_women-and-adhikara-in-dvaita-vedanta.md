Women and Adhikāra in Dvaita Vedānta

The term*adhikāra*has multiple connotations in Sanskrit intellectual
disciplines. It may be loosely translated as eligibility, but it
includes within its scope questions of whether a person has a) the
capacity to do something and b) the legitimate authority to do so.
Discussions on the eligibility of various categories of people to
perform Vedic sacrifices are found already in Jaimini’s*Mīmāṃsāsūtra*,
the root text of the Mīmāṃsā
school[^(\[1\])](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn1)*.*In
Vedānta, a significant part of the discussion on eligibility shifts from
a focus on undertaking sacrifices to undertaking Vedic study and
acquiring the knowledge necessary for liberation.

All Vedānta schools generally bar women from studying Vedic texts, but
dualist (Dvaita) Vedānta has a clearly marked exception to this rule.
Madhva, the thirteenth century founder of the system states in his
commentaries on both the*Brahmasūtra*(*BSB*) and
the*Mahābhārata*(*MBTN*) that superior women (*uttamastriyaḥ*) are
eligible for Vedic learning. However, this brings up questions on which
women belong in the category of superior. Is this category restricted to
divine beings, or does it remain open to human women as well? Answers to
this question are ambiguous, and I look at Madhva’s commentaries with
Jayatīrtha’s sub-commentaries to see whether and how this ambiguity is
clarified.

In the*Jijñāsādhikaraṇa*(1.1.1) of the*BSB*, Madhva cites from an
untraceable text called
the*Bhāgavatatantra*^(**[\[2\]](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn2)**)
to explain the categories of people eligible for Vedic study. In
Madhva’s discussion, the primary eligibility is clearly not for the
performance of sacrifices, but for the knowledge of various scriptural
texts: the Vedas, the Purāṇas, the tantras, etc. Madhva
explains[^(\[3\])](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn3):

Women,*śūdra*s, and fallen*brāhmaṇa*s are eligible for the knowledge
of the tantras, but only when they are in the same place where others
\[who are independently qualified\] are being instructed, and not
\[directly from\] the sacred text Members of the first three*varṇa*s
who are correctly devoted towards Viṣṇu are eligible for Vedic
instruction. They also say that superior women have eligibility for
Vedic \[knowledge\], such as Ūrvaśī, Yamī, Śacī, etc., and the rest.

All the women mentioned here as superior women are divine beings who
appear in Ṛgvedic hymns. This is likely why Madhva has to account for
their eligibility after his previous statement that women do not have
eligibility for Vedic study. However, it is still important that Madhva
leaves the category open-ended. The possibility for other non-divine
women being included is not foreclosed.

Madhva makes another important statement in the*MBTN*on
the issue of superior women. While explaining the knowledge to be
acquired for liberation,Madhva lists out texts that each category must
know or understand in order to be liberated. In this passage, Madhva
says that \[all\] women of the first three*varṇa*s must know the
scriptures other than the Vedas. He goes on to continue that superior
women, such as Draupadī, etc. \[the female protagonist of
the*Mahābhārata*\] should have the knowledge of the Vedas as well. He
then defines superior women in a statement that poses an interesting
conundrum:“Goddesses and wives of sages,**even when**born in human
or other families, are designated as
superior”^([\[4\]](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn4)).The
syntax of the statement \[a, b, even though (api) c\] seems to indicate
that goddesses and wives of sages are superior, even when they take
birth in human or other families. The example given, Draupadī, is
certainly regarded as a divine incarnation by Madhva. This also shows us
the importance of the*Mahābharāta*to Dvaita Vedānta, since it
repeatedly figures indiscussions on*śāstra*s.

However, Madhva’s most important commentator Jayatīrtha,
writing in the fourteenth century, seems to understand Madhva
differently. While commenting on Madhva’s*BSB*, Jayatīrtha explains
Madhva’s statement— “They also say that superior women have eligibility
for Vedic \[knowledge\], such as Ūrvaśī, Yamī, Śacī, etc., and the
rest.” In this section, Madhva has given instances of goddesses and left
the category open-ended. Jayatīrtha glosses the phrase ‘and the rest’
(*tathāparāḥ*) as “the wives of the sages and women born in human and
other families”[^(\[5\])](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn5).
Since this gloss by Jayatīrtha is a direct quotation of Madhva’s words
in the*MBTN*, and Madhva has already mentioned goddesses, it appears as
if Jayatīrtha understands the term ‘and the rest’ to refer to the other
two categories: the wives of sages, and women from human and other
families. This would mean that Jayatīrtha interprets Madhva’s statement
from the*MBTN*as,“Goddesses and wives of sages,**as well as
those**born in human or other families, are designated as superior.”

This clearly makes a huge difference, since it opens up the
possibility of eligibility for human women. However, some commentators
do not clarify the issue, and later commentators, such as
Rāghavendratīrtha, foreclose this possibility by commenting on
Jayatīrtha’s words in ways that again limit the category to divine or
semi-divine women.

Jayatīrtha’s reading is very surprising considering the
stance taken by other Vedāntins, and historical evidence for the loss in
the status of women in medieval India. What social or historical factors
could have prompted this concession, ambiguous as it is, towards women?
Robert Zydenbos has suggested that Madhva had to contend with the
egalitarian ideals espoused by the Vīraśaiva movement in Karnataka, and
that his doctrines are partly
reactionary[^(\[6\])](//EC3E2E3A-5FDF-45A1-AC45-2A9FCA11AE7A#_ftn6).Perhaps
early scholars of Dvaita Vedānta also had to accommodate doctrinal
concessions of this nature, which were revoked post the sixteenth
century, when the influence of Dvaita Vedānta expanded across South
India.

This issue opens about questions about*śāstra*and practice. Despite
the ambiguity in the doctrine, women have clearly not been engaged in
Vedic study within the Dvaita tradition, or indeed, in any of the
Vedānta traditions, for several centuries. Ganeri argues, “\[T\]here is
good evidence for the conjecture that the principal context in which the
Indian writers sought to make an “intervention” was a
literary/intellectual rather than a physical/socio-political
context”[^(\[7\])](//6AB57E78-EE74-4EA4-B53A-2B3C27E89D62#_ftn1).
Jayatīrtha’s could also be one of such intellectual interventions.
