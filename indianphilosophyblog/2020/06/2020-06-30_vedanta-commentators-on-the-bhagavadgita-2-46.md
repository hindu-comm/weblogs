Vedānta commentators on the Bhagavadgītā 2.46

The three main schools of Vedānta in South India—Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita,
and Dvaita all center themselves around a similar canon of sacred texts,
including the Vedas, Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, etc. Of such canonical
scriptures, the*Bhagavadgītā*(*BG*) is regarded as authoritative in
all three traditions and cited frequently in commentaries on other
sacred texts. Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja have each authored a commentary on
the*BG*, while Madhva has authored two.

Accepting the *BG* as authoritative poses to all these schools an
important problem of reconciling the*BG*’s statements on the Vedas,
since all three writers are committed to regarding the Vedas and*BG*as
sacred texts that are consistent with each other. In the*BG*, Kṛṣṇa
refers to the Vedas in ways that appear to undermine their authority,
often by comparing them unfavorably with the*BG*itself. In this post,
I look at*BG*2.45-6, which speak negatively about the Vedas**and see
how Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, and Madhva attempt to re-interpret the verses in
conformity with their own doctrinal commitments.The verses read as
follows:

*The Vedas have that which is related to the threeguṇas
\[sattva,rajas, andtamas\] as their subject. O Arjuna! You be one who
is without the threeguṇas…  
How much is the use of a well with/when there are waters flooded from
all directions? That much is the use of all the Vedas for abrāhmaṇawho
knows.*[^(\[1\])](//4DEC400A-6AC0-4F53-A37B-3FF495B0D0C0#_ftn1)

The*guṇa*s, which Kṛṣṇa explains in detail elsewhere in the*BG*, are
the three forces or modes of material nature. There are multiple
problems in the verses here, but I am interested in the conundrum for
the Vedānta commentators—Kṛṣṇa clearly states that the Vedas deal (only)
with the three*guṇa*s, instructing Arjuna to rise above them. The
Vedas, then, are distinguished from Kṛṣṇa’s own teachings in
the*BG*and have only a limited applicability, which is problematic for
all three commentators. The commentators use the metaphor in the verse
to create ambiguity and defend the Vedas or some part of the Vedas from
the charge of being superfluous.

Śaṅkara does this by narrowing the scope of the*BG*’s statement about
the Vedas to the specific sections of the Vedas that enjoin ritual
actions:

*In the world, all the purposes that can be served by a well, etc., that
has limited water, such as bathing and drinking, can also be served by
water flooded in all directions, i.e., all the uses of a well are
subsumed within the uses of a larger quantity of water. In the same way,
all the purposes served by all the Vedas, i.e., by the actions enjoined
in the Vedas, are subsumed within the purposes served by the knowledge
of the ultimate principle in the case of thebrāhmaṇa, i.e., celibate
monk who possesses such knowledge… Therefore, even actions that are
similar to the well, etc., must be performed by one who is eligible for
such action, before one obtains the eligibility for
knowledge.*[^(\[2\])](//4DEC400A-6AC0-4F53-A37B-3FF495B0D0C0#_ftn2)

In other words,Śaṅkara reads the metaphor as saying that a well is
useless when you have plenty of water.By limiting the statement to
certain sections of the Vedas, Śaṅkara uses this verse to argue for the
superiority of knowledge (*jñāna*) over ritual action (*karma*), but
still manages to defend the Vedic statements that enjoin rituals as
having a limited and preliminary value. While the metaphor tells us that
the Veda has very limited use to a knowledgeable*brāhmaṇa*,Śaṅkara
reads it as advocating for ritual until one has reached such a state of
knowledge.

Rāmānuja reads the metaphor very differently. To Rāmānuja, the primary
question that the verse answers is: “How can it be that the injunctions
of the Vedas must be
discarded?”[^(\[3\])](//4DEC400A-6AC0-4F53-A37B-3FF495B0D0C0#_ftn3)Rāmānuja
is then making an assumption that his ideal reader shares—that the Vedas
cannot be discarded, and consequently, the*BG*, which is an
authoritative text, cannot instruct one to discard them. He proceeds to
elaborate as follows: “Why would the Vedas, which are more affectionate
than thousands of mothers and fathers, which are engaged always in the
welfare of the self, instruct us to perform trivial actions which lead
to being born again and again?” This is the question that Rāmānuja sees
the verse of the*Gītā* as answering.

*All that is enjoined by the Vedas is not to be undertaken by everyone,
just as a thirsty person only obtains the water needed to drink from a
well filled with flooded waters from all directions. Similar is the case
of abrāhmaṇawho knows, with regard to all the Vedas. Avaidikawho
desires liberation must only undertake that \[those actions laid down in
the Vedas\] which is the means for achieving liberation, and not others
\[actions which are
not\].*[^(\[4\])](//4DEC400A-6AC0-4F53-A37B-3FF495B0D0C0#_ftn4)

As we can see, Rāmānuja understands the metaphor of the well and flooded
waters in a manner that conforms to his own philosophical commitment to
the primacy of the Vedas. The meaning of the metaphor, to Rāmānuja, is
not that the flooded waters cause the well to lose its utility in any
way. Rather, Kṛṣṇa is implying that one person cannot use all the water
of the flooded water in the well but must use only a limited amount of
water to fulfil their needs.

Madhva offers two different interpretations of the same two verses. Both
these interpretations assume that these verses as communicating
something other than their apparent meaning, since it is impossible that
the Vedas be unauthoritative or even inapplicable. I will look at
the*Gītābhāṣya*here, where Madhva draws elements fromŚaṅkara and
Rāmānuja, while disagreeing with both:

*All the purposes served by the well with limited water are indeed
subsumed within the purposes served by water flooded from all
directions. Similarly, the results of gained by the actions performed
out of desire (kāmyakarma) as enjoined by the Vedas are subsumed within
the results achieved by abrāhmaṇawho is knowledgeable. Here, the
wordbrāhmaṇais to be understood \[etymologically\] as the one who
reaches (aṇati) God (brahma) and therefore refers to one who has seen
God directly
(aparokṣajñānī).*[^(\[5\])](//4DEC400A-6AC0-4F53-A37B-3FF495B0D0C0#_ftn5)

Madhva’s reading does not oppose the two paths of action and knowledge
against each other as alternatives, since he believes that both must be
performed in tandem in order to achieve liberation, arguing against
Śaṅkara’s view that action can cease after acquiring knowledge. It would
go against Madhva’s doctrine to argue that all ritual actions are
unnecessary upon reaching a state of knowledge. Therefore, Madhva argues
that the reference to the Vedas must be construed narrowly, not to refer
to ritual actions within the Vedas, but to refer only to the optional
ritual actions (*kāmyakarma*s) enjoined therein. Such optional ritual
actions are performed when one has a desire to be fulfilled, and do not
result in any penalty when not performed. Madhva does not clarify in
what way the knowledgeable person obtains the results of such rituals
without performing them. Jayatīrtha, Madhva’s fourteenth century
commentator, understands this to mean that the results achieved by the
one with knowledge reduces the results of such optional rituals to
insignificance. This would be consistent with the general idea in all
three schools of Vedānta that true seekers would not want to gain
material results, since they would seek only liberation.

Another interesting point is that none of these three commentators
understand the word ‘*brāhmaṇa’*in the verse as referring to
the*jāti*or*varṇa*.Śaṅkara glosses the word as ‘monk’ (*sannyāsī*),
an even smaller subset of renunciates, Rāmānuja as ‘a*vaidika*who
desires liberation’, and Madhva as ‘one who has perceived God directly’
(*aparokṣajñānī*), thereby allowing it to refer to different groups of
people.
