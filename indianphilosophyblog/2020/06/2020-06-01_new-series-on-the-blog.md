New series on the blog

Dear readers,

I am sure you enjoyed the posts written by Douglas Berger last month, so
did we. Therefore, we prepared a new treat, namely a series of invited
speakers who will share the scene with the “usual” IPhbloggers for the
next months, for one month each. You will thus encounter new voices,
coming from promising PhD students, as well as read again established
professors who have already contributed to the blog in the past. As
usual, comments and discussion are welcome (and so are encouragement and
support).
