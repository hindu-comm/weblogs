Eudaimonist Buddhist modernism and the norm of authenticity

I now finish my present reply to [Evan Thompson’s
response](%5D(http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2020/04/25/clarifying-why-i-am-not-a-buddhist-a-response-to-amod-lele-guest-post-by-evan-thompson/)).
Let us return to Thompson’s general critique of Buddhist modernism. He
doesn’t “reject using Buddhist ideas in the project of ameliorating
suffering and promoting human flourishing.” On that, it seems, we are in
agreement. Rather, what he objects to is “the rhetoric and logic that
Buddhist modernists typically use in pursuing this project.” So let’s
revisit what he takes issue with in this rhetoric and logic:

> Buddhist modernists recast Buddhist concepts in a way that makes them
> incongruent with their traditional meanings and functions. They
> thereby miss (and miss out on) the radical and challenging aspects of
> the Buddhist tradition. They mistakenly project their revisions back
> onto the “historical Buddha” as a way to legitimate them. Finally,
> they claim that Buddhism is inherently more open to this kind of
> modernist recasting than other religions are. In other words, they
> promote what I call “Buddhist exceptionalism,” the mistaken belief
> that Buddhism is superior to other religions in being inherently
> rational and empirical.

I think that I have shown how, contra Thompson’s claim, my recasting of
karma
[is](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/is-karma-about-why-bad-things-happen-to-good-people/)
[*not*](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/the-workings-of-karma-naturalized-and-otherwise/)
[incongruent](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/bad-things-good-people-and-eudaimonism/)
with its traditional meanings and functions. I am aware of Buddhist
tradition’s
[radical](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/on-being-buddhist-and-distinctively-buddhist/)
[challenge](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/grappling-with-impermanence/)
to worldly existence, and I [take it
seriously](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/on-being-buddhist-and-distinctively-buddhist/),
but in the end I [do not accept
it](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/grappling-with-impermanence/).
I acknowledge these views of mine are an innovation and a recasting, not
one that Śāntideva or the *sutta* authors (let alone the mysterious
historical Buddha)would have accepted, even though there are
continuities with those thinkers’ ideas. [Nor am I a “Buddhist
exceptionalist”](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/naturalizing-buddhism-and-other-traditions)
in Thompson’s sense. So in the end, I do not think that Thompson’s
critique of Buddhist modernist rhetoric and logic applies to a
eudaimonist Buddhism like mine.

There is one more important point in Thompson’s response that I have not
yet addressed. He rejects many varieties of Buddhist modernism,
including eudaimonism, but does put forward an alternative, an
apparently preferred form of modern(ist?) Buddhism. Thompson says: “If
we’re going to recast the Buddhist idea of liberation in modern terms,
then I submit we should understand it as involving a profound
reconfiguration of our existence as governed by the norm of
authenticity, not simply as a change to our mental states and traits as
psychology conceives of them.”

What is this “norm of authenticity”? He explains it in the post as “how
we choose to lead our own lives given our lack of any fixed nature or
essence, and in the face of our inevitable death.” Such an ideal of
authenticity sounds existentialist, and Thompson says he sympathizes
with “those Buddhist modernists… who look to existential phenomenology…
to understand liberation.” But I don’t think an existentialist norm of
authenticity is any easier a fit with traditional Buddhism than is a
psychologically oriented notion of well-being. I take existentialism to
be basically [a form of qualitative
individualism](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/12/existentialism-is-a-qualitative-individualism/),
in that it urges one to be most authentically *oneself*. Indeed, to
refer to what I have called qualitative individualism, Charles Taylor
uses the phrase “[the ethics of
authenticity](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/)“.

But qualitative individualism [runs smack into the Buddhist doctrine of
non-self](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/02/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/).
Traditional Buddhist philosophy would tell us there is, and can be, no
such thing as an authentic self. So likewise it would view a Sartrean
emphasis on *choice* with suspicion: it is not the choice that is
determinative. Insofar as choice exists at all (rather than everything
being the product of determining causality), there is a right choice
–to seek liberation from suffering and the craving and clinging to self
that trap one in it –and a wrong one, to continue craving and clinging
to the self. To make the right choice leads one to *forego* one’s
selfhood, authentic or otherwise, and transcend it through monastic
self-discipline; to choose a norm of authenticity is to remain clinging
to self, and *avoid* a radical transformation.

Now, [if you’ve been following this series so
far](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/grappling-with-impermanence/),
you know I don’t endorse the rejection of worldly life any more than
Thompson does. Indeed I have [deep sympathies for qualitative
individualism](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/12/the-case-for-individual-teleology/)
and have looked for ways that [Buddhism and qualitative individualism
could be made
compatible](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/06/a-sellarsian-solution-for-the-self/).
So I am not making a deep constructive objection to Thompson’s approach
here. My point is just that I don’t think his preferred approach, of
following a norm of authenticity, gets us any closer to the kind of
radical transformation that traditional Buddhism advocates than does a
more psychologically oriented conception of well-being. The former is no
less comfortable and no more challenging than the latter.

This concludes my present reply to Thompson. Since our dialogue now
spans almost a dozen posts, my final post in this series will be an
index collecting the correspondence in one place.
