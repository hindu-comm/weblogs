History of Philosophies, East and West

This interdisciplinary joint MA program brings together expert faculty
in the history of philosophy in two of Stony Brook University’s
departments: Asian & Asian American Studies and Philosophy. It enables
students to broaden their knowledge of philosophy by treating it as a
world-wide, rather than an exclusively western, undertaking. The program
provides Humanities students with philosophically informed and
historically grounded perspectives on what is arguably the principal
cultural encounter of our time.

Curriculum

Coursework focuses on key aspects of the following philosophical
traditions: Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, Islamic, ancient Greek and
Roman, Christian medieval, and modern European. Teaching is based on
primary texts in English translation, with selective use of secondary
sources. Special emphasis is placed on understanding native terms and
concepts from the original languages of works studied. The historical
texts that you will study belong to these areas of inquiry: ethics,
metaphysics, theories of knowledge, social and political philosophy,
aesthetics, philosophical anthropology, and philosophical theology.

Program Requirements

This 30-credits MA degree can be earned in one year. But it is
recommended that full-time students complete the HPEW program as
follows: Year one: 24 credits (four 3-credit courses per semester) Year
two: 6 credits (two 3-credit in the semester of full-time enrollment) It
is also possible to enroll in HPEW on a part-time basis (i.e., by taking
fewer than 12 credit hours per semester)
