The duty to do philosophy interculturally

“Is the debate on global justice a global one?”—asks Anke
[Graness](http://anke-graness.de/) at the beginning of an article
(available OA
[here](https://w07ex2010hub1.arz.oeaw.ac.at/owa/redir.aspx?C=nrUa4Cwlqkqbt680X0vp6_xTop_f0NIIRQFs_US7s1qmhcUD6DB01dbdBiyYJqV-A12sqJCcNj8.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fdx.doi.org%2f10.1080%2f17449626.2015.1010014))
in which she analyses the more common positions on global justice held
in Western academia and confronts them with the perspective on justice
of two contemporary African philosophers (the Kenyan Henry Odera Oruka
and the Ethiopian Theodros Kiros) and with the reinterpretation of the
traditional African concept of *ubuntu* (yes, it is not only an IT
system!).

This cross-cultural comparison is generally neglected by Western
academics, who rather debate among their peers, who tend to be other
Western academics. This lack of inclusion is particularly ironic in the
case of the debate on global justice, since:

> Astonishingly, even though the goal of the debate is to find and
> justify universally valid principles of global justice, the concepts,
> norms, and values of regions of the world other than Europe and North
> America are rarely taken into account. While the possibility for
> discourse and exchange \[…\] was and is available \[…\] the lack of a
> truly intercultural exchange reveals the injustice of the academic
> discourse. (p. 127)

Apart from the interesting topic of global justice, Graness makes some
points which could be applied to potentially any philosophical
enterprise. First, she notes the risk of

> ‘othering’, namely the belief that every culture or region has to
> develop by default ideas essentially different from European theory to
> be worth consideration. (p. 131)

I have discussed this risk especially on the Indian Philosophy Blog
while speaking about possible strategies to make Western scholars aware
of Indian philosophy. Readers might remember that [I
expressed](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/08/03/the-matilal-strategy/#comments)
the
[concern](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/07/20/if-you-work-on-indian-philosophy-in-north-america-in-europein-japanin-india/#comments)
that a strategy like Matilal’s could have meant leading people to
consider that Indian philosophy is so similar, that it does not deserve
separate consideration. Now I know how to call this risk.

The risk of “othering” quickly leads to another risk, which I would call
of
“[exoticisation](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/05/24/a-reader-on-indian-philosophy/)“,
so that the West is considered the norm and other views are welcome as
exotic additions to the norm. Graness points it out when she writes:

> Here we are confronted with biased expectations which shape our
> perception of theories from different regions of the world, namely
> that ‘Western’ scholars formulate universal theories, whereas scholars
> from all other regions formulate regional theories. (p. 132)

This is what happens, I believe, when a book on topic X discusses
Western views of X for 23 out of 24 contributions and then adds a
chapter on “Non-Western views on X”.\* To put it plainly, a discussion
of X which welcomes challenges, answers and ideas from wherever they
come appears to me to be more likely to be fruitful of new stimuli.

Further, Graness discusses the causes of the lack of inclusion of
non-Western (and, I would add, non-mainstream) ideas in the mainstream
philosophical discourse:

1.  “Even though the academy claims to be free of politico-economical
    and ideological constraints, it cannot avoid being affected by the
    structural imbalance of power relations in our world” (p. 135)
2.  “The canon-forming power of the universities” (ibid.). This point
    reminds me of Eric Schwitzgebel’s acute formula: “Because the
    dominant academic culture in the U.S. traces back to Europe, the
    ancient Chinese philosophers were not taught to, and thus not read
    by, the succeeding generations. Ignorance thus apparently justifies
    ignorance: Because we don’t know their work, they have little impact
    on our philosophy. Because they have little impact on our
    philosophy, we believe we are justified in remaining ignorant about
    their work.” (for a fuller discussion with further links, see
    [here](http://elisafreschi.com/2015/09/21/studying-chinese-indian-africana-philosophy-as-part-of-the-regular-curriculum/#more-1954)).
3.  “An author’s ability to choose a publisher has an enormous influence
    on which audience a publication will reach” (p. 135.)
4.  Financial resources
5.  Language: “a lingua franca clearly gives native speakers an
    advantage over non-native speakers” and one risks to assume that
    “what is not translated into English is irrelevant” (p. 136)

The result of all these factors, concludes Graness, is that

> Euro-American-dominated philosophical discourse is in its majority
> unawre of concepts and arguments beyond its narrow discursive
> boundaries (p. 136).

Graness is however not content with the exposition of the problem and
tries to suggest solutions:

> First, philosophers have to be aware of their own contextuality and
> how it influences their thinking. (p. 137)

A point which could be enlarged as to encompass the scrutine of one’s
prejudices as the constant duty of a philosopher *qua* philosopher (see
[this](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/implicit-paradigms.html)
post).  
Further:

> Second, \[…\] this means undertaking the often-difficult,
> time-consuming search for voices and sources from other regions of the
> world to start a comprehensive discussion **This is not the easy way,
> but choosing the easy way keeps one at the navel-gazing stage**.
> (ibid., emphasis added)

Graness works on cross-cultural and on African philosophy. **Would we,
as scholars of different traditions within philosophy, share her views?
What would we say differently?**

\*Full disclosure: I have myself contributed a chapter on “Indian
Philosophers” to the *Blackwell Companion to the Philosophy of Action*
edited by Timothy O’Connor and Constantine Sandis. It is possibly the
most read thing I have ever written and I enjoyed writing and discussing
it, but I sense the risk of ghettisation that these enterprises carry
with them.
