The Gendered Conference Campaign and Panel Organizing

**Introduction**

Recently, we—Elisa Freschi and Malcolm Keating—set about organizing a
panel for the upcoming
[ATINER](http://www.atiner.gr/philosophy.htm "ATINER") panel. We
aimedfor a panel which would include significant numbers of women,
using suggestions from the[Gendered Conference
Campaign](https://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ "gendered conference campaign")(GCC)
published on the Feminist Philosophers website to achieve this goal. Not
only is the result an exciting combination of global philosophical
interests which can push back against stereotypes of philosophy as a
Western activity, its gender ratio can push back against stereotypes of
philosophy as a male activity. Ourhope is that the more panels and
conferences which work to include women, the more women’s names will
come to mind as experts in these topics. Further, hopefully younger
generations of women will find it easier to find a path in academic
philosophy. And finally, including more women who might otherwise be
ignored due to implicit bias means better philosophy will be done.

Below are reflections from both of usabout the reasoning for this
decision, the process of organizing, and the results.

**Elisa Freschi:**

For years, I have never thought about issues such as the ones raised by
the GCC, and have always looked at myself as a human being among whose
characteristics the fact of being a woman is neither the more important,
nor the more significant when it comes to my philosophical work.
However, I started changing my mind when confronted with the fact that
many men did not share the same view and were keen to impose on me all
sorts of judgements I tend to understand as prejudices (e.g., thinking
that I am a student (or even a secretary!) and not the organiser of a
given conference, thinking that I must have reached my position because
of being someone else’s wife or pupil, etc. etc.). This made me alert of
issues such as the implicit bias, and I started suggesting to my
colleagues to think at least*also*of inviting women at each chance.
This alertness, I thought, at least compensates for the implicit bias
which makes us think immediately at brilliant men and only as an
afterthought at women (perhaps also because they have been socialised in
a way which makes “brilliance” less desirable, e.g., by highlighting the
need of being gregarious and not aggressive).

Thus, I have been pleasantly surprised by Malcolm’s suggestion to try to
invite at first only women. Since the panel deals with an issue I have
been working on for years, it did not take me too long to write down a
list of women I would have wanted to attend —and they were all
outstanding scholars. Accordingly, I wrote repeatedly to fifteen women
colleagues before deciding to advertise the panel on my blog. The first
move was meant to ensure a strong participation by women, while the
second was dictated to me by the idea that conferences should be at
least theoretically open to all interested people.  
Interestingly, the final result is a panel with six women and four men,
including the organisers. I hope that explaining why this happened will
be of some value for future enterprises of this sort:

1.  Many women I contacted where thrilled by the topic of the panel, but
    could not participate due to several other commitments. Please note
    that some of them mentioned among the commitments family ones
    (having to take care of children or relatives) and academic ones
    (being among the few women in their department, they had to serve in
    many committees).
2.  Since the time they confirmed their participation, two women and no
    man had to withdraw it (because of academic commitments of the sort
    discussed at point 1). This might be entirely coincidental (but,
    similarly, two women and no men had to withdraw their participation
    from the panel I organised for the[World Sanskrit
    Conference](http://www.sanskrit-silpakorn.org/registration-form-wsc.php)),
    but it might also be the result of the many pressures women are
    exposed to?
3.  Only men contacted me or Malcolm after having seen the Call for
    Papers. This might be due to various reasons, but perhaps also to
    the fact that women tend as a rule to be less ready to propose
    themselves? If so, this would be a further reasons for actively
    inviting them.
4.  Long story short, if you think it advisable to have inclusive
    conferences, plan well ahead and personally contact women scholars.

**Malcolm Keating:**Inspired by the Gendered Conference Campaign
published on the Feminist Philosophers blog, in initial emails with
Elisa I suggested that we aim for a parity of men and women on the
panel, if not *more* women than men. The reasoning for this decision is
put succinctly at the GCC page I’ve linked to:

> All-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of
> philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias
> against women in philosophy, which very likely leads even those
> genuinely committed to gender equality to evaluate women’s
> contributions as less good than men’s.

The goal is not to give women a disproportionate number of
opportunities, but to compensate for the implicit biases and other
factors which limit their opportunities, and have done so for centuries.
This has resulted in undervaluing women as intellectuals and means that
it is much more likely that men will come to mind when considering
philosophers to invite to conferences. A simple thought experiment is
enough to see that the first names that come to one’s mind are indeed,
of men. Even more surprisingly, once one starts thinking also of women,
one notices that they are by no means less good than the men one
initially thought of—the men’s names are just more quickly accessible.

In early emails making this suggestion, I worried that, as a more junior
philosopher than Elisa, I had fewer connections to the women working in
Indian (and non-Western) philosophy. So, for our first round of
invitations, Elisa took the lead in contacting women philosophers. She
got in touch with people whose work she knew was excellent and whose
philosophical demeanor would contribute to our panel conversation. We
invited only women at this point and cast the net widely. We wanted a
compelling panel that would do excellent philosophical work, not
necessarily just “big names.” This goes to the second point in the
advice at the FP blog:

> less famous men.

Why invite only women? Well, since, for any conference panel invitation,
one is not going to get 100% responses from invitees, we knew it was
likely we would send out a second round of invitations. Men would get
their chance–and given implicit biases, we men are already getting more
than our fair share of chances as it is. Thus, points three and four:

> 3\. Don’t wait till the last minute to invite women.
>
> 4\. If there really are not that many women in your field, perhaps
> consult with them first about dates. You have to ask someone first, so
> why not them?

Even though we were organizing a panel for an established conference,
and thus consulting with women about setting dates wasn’t at issue, we
did invite women first, giving them an opportunity to consider their
availability with more advance time (for women who have families, they
frequently bear a significant aspect of child-care).

**Questions to the reader:**  
Can you suggest feasible ways to overcome these problems? For one, a
child care provided during the conference might help with (part of) No.
1, as well as perhaps an increased travel allowance for scholars with
babies?
