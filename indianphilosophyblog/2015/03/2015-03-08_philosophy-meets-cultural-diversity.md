Philosophy Meets Cultural Diversity

[Warp, Weft, and Way draws our attention to an upcoming
conference](http://warpweftandway.com/philosophy-meets-cultural-diversity/ "Philosophy Meets Cultural Diversity"),
called “Philosophy Meets Cultural Diversity,” at the University of
Pittsburgh.
[Here](http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/Events/All/Conferences/others/other_conf_2014-15/03-13-15_diversity/diversity_details.html "Pitt Conference details")is
a link to the program, which has as its goal “to bring together
anthropologists, psychologists, comparative philosophers, and
experimental philosophers in order to further our understanding of the
similarities and differences in the lay understanding of, on the one
hand, knowledge, and, on the other, agency and person across cultures.”
The conference runs March 13th and 14th.

Among the exciting lineup is my dissertation chair here at UT-Austin,
Stephen Phillips, who will be speaking, as well as our own Anand Vaidya,
who is an invited panelist. It’s also nice to see (in relation to my
[last
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/03/06/the-gendered-conference-campaign-and-panel-organizing/ "gendered conference campaign")
with Elisa Freschi) that the conference includes several women
philosophers (Miri Albahari,Winnie Sung,Amita Chatterjee, Kaori
Karasawa) as well as women from other fields.

I can’t tell whether the conference proceedings will be made available
in any form, but in the meantime, for those of us who cannot attend,
this is a good place to discuss the conference aims. Below is a
description in more detail and a few questions:

> Over the last decade, the newly emerging field of “experimental
> philosophy” has posed a challenge to the claim that professional
> philosophers’ judgments about philosophically important thought
> experiments are universal. Rather, in a growing number of studies, it
> has been shown that people in different cultural groups – Asians and
> Westerners, males and females, people of high and low socio-economic
> status, people with different personality types, people of different
> ages, people with different native languages, etc. – have different
> intuitions about cases designed to explore what people think about
> knowledge, morality, free will, consciousness and other important
> philosophical issues. However, the extent and sources of this
> variation remain by and large unknown. The goal of this conference is
> to bring together anthropologists, psychologists, comparative
> philosophers, and experimental philosophers in order to further our
> understanding of the similarities and differences in the lay
> understanding of, on the one hand, knowledge, and, on the other,
> agency and person across cultures. Furthermore, we hope to sketch new
> avenues of research for philosophically sophisticated cross-cultural
> studies of the concepts of knowledge, person, and agency.

Questions:

1.  Suppose it were to be empirically demonstrated that intuitions
    differ in a way that can be mapped to classifications such as those
    listed above. How would that (or would it) impact your philosophical
    work?
2.  To what degree, and in what ways, ought philosophers be seeking out
    anthropologists, psychologists, and so on, in order to understand
    “knowledge and agency across cultures”? Do comparative philosophers
    have an obligation to be up-to-date in current work in sociology,
    etc. in a way that, say, philosophers of science might with regard
    to current physics?
3.  Finally, do you think work in Indian philosophyought to engage with
    current work in experimental philosophy? How?
