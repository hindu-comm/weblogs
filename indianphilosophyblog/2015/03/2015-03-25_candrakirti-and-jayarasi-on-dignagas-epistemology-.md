Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi on Dignāga’s Epistemology (Part One)

In his*Pramāṇasamuccaya*, Dignāgaclaims that there are two means of
knowledge (*pramāṇas*): perception (*pratyakṣa*) and inference
(*anumāna*). Perception has as its object the particular (*svalakṣana*);
inference has as its object the universal (*sāmānyalakṣana*). The key
distinguishing feature between the two is that “perception is free
from*kalpanā*(imagination, conceptual construction)”
(*Pramāṇasamuccaya*, 1.3a). This is an exclusive dichotomy: any means of
knowledge must be either perception or inference, but not both.

The Madhyamaka
philosopher,[Candrakīrti](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/madhyamaka/#4),
offers the following argument against Dignāga: “… if it is said that
there are two means of knowledge (*pramāṇas*) through adherence to two
characteristics – particular and universal, then that characterized
thing, of which there are two characterizing marks (i.e., particular and
universal), does that exist, or on the other hand, does it not exist? If
it exists, then there is another third object of knowledge (*prameya*)
than those two, so how are there two means? On the other hand, if that
which is characterized does not exist, then the characterization is also
without a basis, so how could there be two means of knowledge?”
(*Prasannapāda*, p. 20, lines 20-23).

The Cārvāka
skeptic[Jayarāśi](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/)gives
what I call “The Impossibility of Considering Duality Argument.”
Jayarāśi begins with the notion that perception apprehends itself and
inference apprehends itself, but neither can apprehend the other
according to Dignāga. Jayarāśi concludes, “Thus, talking or thinking
about the number \[of means of knowledge\] being two is impossible”
(*Tattvopaplavasiṃha*, 3.3a). Eli Franco spells out the presupposition
that makes the argument work:

> In order to determine the number of means of valid cognition, one has
> to have them all as the object of one and the same cognition. However,
> according to the Buddhists, a cognition is not apprehended by another
> cognition, but only by itself. Nor is there an*ātman*which could
> coordinate the different cognitions. Thus, one may perceive perception
> by perception, and inference by inference, but never both at the same
> time. Consequently, whatever the number of means of valid cognition
> may be, there is no way of knowing it. (Franco 1994, 430 n. 184)

Thus, Jayarāśi’s argument rules out the possibility of even considering
the Buddhist thesis that there are two means of knowledge. He ends his
chapter on Buddhist epistemology with the following: “And when this
(i.e., there being two means of knowledge) is not possible, saying
‘There are only two means of knowledge’ is the gesticulation of a fool”
(*Tattvopaplavasiṃha*, 3.3a).

**Are Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi giving roughly the same argument against
Dignāga?**

In Part Two I will ask: Do Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi raise serious
problems for Dignāga’s epistemology?
