Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi on Dignāga’s Epistemology (Part Two)

In [Part
One](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/03/25/candrakirti-and-jayarasi-on-dignagas-epistemology-part-one/),
I explained the critiques of Dignāga’s epistemology offered by
Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi. In Part Two, I’ll consider whether these
arguments create serious problems for Dignāga’s epistemology.

I suspect that the two arguments are different in that Candrakīrti
focuses on the object of knowledge (*prameya*) while Jayarāśi’s focus is
on the means of knowledge (*pramāṇa*). Whether Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi
are giving the same argument, they are both exploiting what they see as
a self-referential problem in Dignāga’s epistemology: if the content of
Dignāga’s epistemological theory is correct, then that theory itself
could never be established. These arguments both fit what Graham Priest
calls an Inclosure Schema (see Priest 2002, which includes Priest’s and
Jay Garfield’s co-authored article applying this schema to some of
[Nāgārjuna](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nagarjun/)’s arguments). But does
Dignāga’s theory really have this problem?

Dignāga might claim that both means of knowledge could be the object of
an inferential cognition. Jayarāśi considers such an objection from a
Buddhist opponent:

> But then someone might object that the ascertainment of two
> \[pramāṇas\] is due to conceptualization. This is not correct. Even
> that conceptualization does not grasp two \[pramāṇas\], because it
> concludes in the cognition of itself. Or if it did grasp \[two
> pramāṇas\], then the \[Buddhist\] position would be abandoned.
> (Tattvopaplavasiṃha, 3.3a)

If an inferential cognition could have a perceptual cognition as its
object, Buddhists would abandon their position that perception is free
from conceptualization. Jayarāśi may also be alluding to the Buddhist
position of momentariness: since the conceptual cognition terminates in
a single moment, it cannot last into a second moment in order to
apprehend perception as well. Buddhists may reply that inferential
cognitions can be about perceptual cognitions without revoking the
non-conceptual status of the perceptual cognition, or maybe an appeal to
exclusion (*apoha*) might be used to show that inferential cognitions
can have some causal relation to perceptual cognitions of ultimately
real particulars.

However, even if inferential cognitions could somehow be about
perception, I think that Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi raise a serious
problem for Dignāga. Dan Arnold discusses a similar issue with help from
[Wilfrid Sellars’s Myth of the
Given](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/#4). The idea is that
non-conceptual states cannot justify anything insofar as justification
requires something conceptual that is capable of being entered into what
Sellars calls the “logical space of reasons.” If a cognition is
non-conceptual, it can’t be used to justify a belief such as the belief
that there are two means of knowledge. At best, it might cause such a
belief. Dignāga or
[Dharmakīrti](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/) might say
that a causal relation is good enough. However, as Arnold says,

> … if perception’s privileged status is a function of its having been
> caused by its object, and if discursive cognitions are defined by
> their adding something (insofar as their content involves, by
> definition, some object that is not immediately present), then how can
> one ever be sure that what one is thinking about, when entertaining
> some proposition, is in any sense the same thing that was perceived?
> (Arnold 2005, 38)

Arnold suggests that this leads to a self-referential problem:

> … one might ask what reasons could be given, in their own account, to
> support the correlated beliefs that only causally efficacious objects
> are ‘real’ and … that only directly caused cognitions are finally
> veridical. … The truth of their own statement of this claim is
> something that could be known only inferentially; but their whole
> epistemological set-up leads any inferential knowledge to be regarded
> as suspect. (Arnold 2005, 42)

In other words, Dignāga cannot claim that perception is both
epistemically fundamental and non-conceptual. We can’t be sure that our
inferences allegedly about perception are in fact caused by perception –
while inference might yield knowledge about inference, we can never be
sure that it yields knowledge about perception. Therefore, the problem
that Arnold identifies deepens objections like Jayarāśi’s and
Candrakīrti’s.

Furthermore, if Arnold is right that one of Dharmakīrti’s most important
commentators, Dharmottara, attempted to solve this problem by claiming
that even perceptual cognitions might have some sort of propositional,
conceptual content (Arnold 2005, 42-48), this would show that the kind
of problem Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi raise was an issue taken seriously
by philosophers in the tradition after Dignāga and Dharmakīrti. This
suggests that Candrakīrti’s and Jayarāśi’s considerations are problems
that Buddhist epistemologists ought to take seriously. In fact, some did
take these problems seriously.

**Do you think the sorts of self-referential issues raised by
Candrakīrti and Jayarāśi are serious problems for Dignāga’s
epistemology?**
