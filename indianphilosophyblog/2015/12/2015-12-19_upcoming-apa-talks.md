If I’ve missed a talk or panel having to do with Indian philosophy,
please let me know in the comments. Also, I imagine that gatherings of
those of us attending will happen naturally, but if folks would like to
share emails to be in contact during the meeting, you’re welcome touse
the comments for that.
