Correction: Free Springer texts available online

**Edited:** My apologies–the free books were for a very limitedperiod
and by the time I posted this announcement, the promotion was over! I’m
sorry for misleading readers. I’ll keep an eye out for future promotions
and make sure to announce them more quickly. In the meantime, here are a
few links where you can find free/cheap books (perhaps readers can add
suggestions in comments)?
