A Detailed Critique of the Philosophical Gourmet Report, care of the Daily Nous

In September of last year, Andrew Nicholson posted a thread on
[Philosophy’s Western
Bias](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/09/17/christian-coseru-on-philosophys-western-bias/),
centered on [Christian Coseru’s
reflections](http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/09/philosophys-western-bias-and-what-can-be-done-about-it.html#more)
on the systemic marginalization of non-Western thought in our
discipline. One important subtheme of the ensuing discussions was the
way that the [Philosophical Gourmet
Report](http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/) and its peculiar rankings
system feeds into this marginalization. Please see the link below for a
Daily Nous summary of the major points in [Brian Bruya’s new article in
Metaphilosophy](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12161/full),
which is a “data-driven critique” of the PGR and its methodology.

While we aren’t keen on the cancerous gossipy side of disciplinary
politics on this site, this issue is, imho, centrally important to those
of us who work in Indian philosophy for a variety of reasons. There are
a number of concerns we have, including how best to serve those who are
interested in Indian philosophy and who would like to learn about what’s
available. Of course, a prospective student should start

But further, there are ways that Leiter’s rankings, intentionally or
not, disincentivize philosophy departments from hiring non-Western
philosophers. In the robust comments on original discussion initiated by
Christian Coseru, my own thoughts were as follows.

Any thoughts on what we can do to improve the situation, esp. things
that are actually realistic?
