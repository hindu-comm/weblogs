End of the year balances

Dear readers and co-bloggers,

in the last months, I thought again and again about what we could do as
a “end of the year” blogpost. I wondered whether we should **list here
our publications** (you are welcome to do it in the comments, by the
way, I, for one, am always curious to know what other people are working
on) **or our major achievements** (same as above).

However, allow me to ask a more radical question: **What should count as
an achievement for us?** How should we evaluate the success-rate of a
given year? My first answer would be **doing good\* research and trying
to share my results so that they are available to interested readers**.
However, the problem becomes more complicated as soon as we try to get
objective measures for both goals —and objective measures would be
desirable, in order to achieve better clarity for our goals.  
Here are some candidates:

1.  You published an article in a top-10 journal
2.  You published N articles/books/reviews…
3.  You taught N (graduate/undergraduate) classes (and survived:-))
4.  You met new interesting colleagues
5.  You got N interviews/a job offer/a (TT or temporary) job/earned
    tenure/your project has been accepted
6.  You tutored or helped N students
7.  You organised N conferences/workshops/webinars…
8.  You have been invited to speak at X
9.  You have received N emails of people asking for your advice or
    telling you that they enjoy your work

(Am I missing something? Please let me know)

Now, the problem is: Which ones are pseudo-indicators of success and
what counts really? It is not easy to tell, especially since, e.g., less
innovative and ultimately useless articles may be fashionable and thus
get published on top-10 journals whereas books which might not be
influential now could become so in one hundred years. Thus, even if we
could agree on the general goal, it remains unclear how to identify how
we *should* be spending our time in order to achieve it.  
My solution is that I try

-   a\) to envision a 5- or 10-years plan (which includes concrete goals
    such as: editing and translating the published and unpublished
    portions of Veṅkaṭanātha’s *Seśvaramīmāṃsā*, publishing my
    translation of Rāmānujācārya’s *Tantrarahasya*, translating the
    *tarkapāda* of Prabhākara’s *Bṛhatī*).
-   b\) check how much progress I made in that direction in the last 12
    months.
-   c\) go to a) and be more realistic
-   d\) write down what should be (realistically) done in the next six
    to twelve months in order to progress in the direction of the goals
    set in a’)

Interestingly enough, as long as I can day-dream with 10 years at my
disposal, I tend to over-estimate what I will achieve. Step b) makes me,
instead, realise how short are the years. I can thus re-write my goals
for the step a) and consider more carefully what I can do in ten years
and what needs to be done in the next year.

**What are your strategies for planning a successful year? And how
successful has been this year for you?**

\*I don’t buy the idea that “good” means “low quality” and that our goal
should be nothing less than “outstanding”.
