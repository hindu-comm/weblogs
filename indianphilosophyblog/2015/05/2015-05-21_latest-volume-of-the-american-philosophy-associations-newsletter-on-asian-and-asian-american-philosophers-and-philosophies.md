Latest volume of the American Philosophy Association’s Newsletter on Asian and Asian American Philosophers and Philosophies

Friends, Volume 14.2 of the American Philosophy Association’s Newsletter
on Asian and Asian American Philosophers and Philosophies is out,
co-edited by Prasanta Bandyopadhyay and yours truly.

The contributors include established philosophers in our field like
Stephen Phillips and Graham Priest, as well as some younger philosophers
and cultural historians.

In the next month or so, I hope to make separate posts on some of the
issues discussed in the newsletter, probably starting with Phillips’
idea that Vācaspatimiśra is really not a mere scholastic or academic
whose work is limited by whatever school he is considering at the time
but rather a thinker who is developing his own theses in his work, which
range across the schools.
