Graham Priest on why study Asian philosophy

Graham Priest explains in a blog
[post](http://dailynous.com/2015/05/23/philosophie-sans-frontieres-guest-post-by-graham-priest/)
why one should study “Eastern” philosophy (his label, probably because
standard philosophy is in fact “Western” philosophy).  
His post points to two reasons:

1.  One better understands one’s own culture if one is confronted with
    another one
2.  There *is* progress in philosophy and new ideas can contribute to
    it, since progress does not arise ex nihilo.

It is difficult not to agree. I had discussed Priest’s first point
[here](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2010/04/why-do-we-study-sanskrit-and-other-dead.html)
and his second point
[here](http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2013/06/why-should-philosophers-study-indian.html),
while referring to an interview with Jay Garfield, and the posts have
raised interesting discussions in the comments.

Since, however, the first post is dated to 2010 and the second one to
2013 and both were posted on a different blog, it may be time to ask
you, dear readers: **What should be the reasons for engaging with Asian
philosophies?**
