Included, along with heavyweights of the Western phenomenological
tradition such as Nancy, Lyotard, Gadamer, Sartre, Warnock, Heidegger
and Husserl, is **J.N. Mohanty’s“Phenomenology and Indian Philosophy:
The Concept of Rationality”, Vol. 19, No. 3, 1988, pp.
269-281.**(direct link

In the paper Mohanty shows the struggles we facein understanding
non-Western philosophies. This was especially interesting following our
last post on[Graham
Priest’s](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/05/24/graham-priest-on-why-studying-asian-philosophy/)discussion
of studying Asian philosophy. In his section titled**Sketch of a Theory
to Overcome Relativism,**Mohanty writes:

Mohantycontinues that this approach leads to an epistemological
problem, namely: how can we know the worlds of the ‘other’ in this case?
His solution is that we must enter into that world or framework
ourselves:

> Could it be that there are *other* worlds, *other* modes of thinking,
> others in the genuine sense, which are yet accessible to us, not
> because we all are the same, but because (i) we can also transcend our
> own ‘worlds’, (ii) our ‘worlds’ however different nevertheless have
> overlapping contents, and (iii) a common identical world is in the
> process of being constituted by such overlapping contents and by the
> reflective process of trying to make senseof each other.

Drawing on Husserl, Mohanty suggests that yes, we can transcend our
limited world and peer into the world of another, discovering
“overlapping contents” while still “preserving the otherness of the
other.”

The paper continues with brief and rough outlines of ways that
Indianschools of thought, includingNaiyāyikas,Mīmāṃsākas, and
Buddhists, have reasoned about a variety of topics including a theory of
consciousness, temporality,*pramāna*, and so on. The range of topics
and schools covered opens Mohanty to the criticism commonly leveled at
general overviews, but the point that he makes in the article: that
Indians did think seriously and indeed*philosophically* about these
topics still stands. As he states in the conclusion:

> One point stands out clearly: the Indian philosophies are not
> philosophies in a sense that is *radically* different from the sense
> that was instituted for the Western world by Greek thought. If the
> idea of pure theory was denied by insisting on the bearing of

Prescient words as we continue to battle relativism in philosophy
departments, as well as a hit of that same insight that Pierre Hadot is
now famous for, seeing that early philosophy always “with an eye on
practice-at a certain level, on a possible transformation of life….”
