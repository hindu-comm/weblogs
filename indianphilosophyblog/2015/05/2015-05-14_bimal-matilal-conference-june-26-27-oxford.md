Bimal Matilal Conference, June 26-27, Oxford

Jonardon Ganeri has asked me to publicize an upcoming conference this
summer dedicated to the memory of his teacher, the great Bimal Krishna
Matilal. It will be held in Wolfson College, Oxford. Many leading
scholars will be giving talks that touch on Prof. Matilalâ€™s legacy in
the study of Indian philosophy.
