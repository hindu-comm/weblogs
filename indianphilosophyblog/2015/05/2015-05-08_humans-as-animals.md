Humans as animals

Humans are not animals according to Descartes’ distinction of *res
cogitans* and *res extensa*. They are also not animals according to many
Christian theologians (Jesus came to save humans, not animals). Perhaps
humans are not (only) animals also according to the Aristotelian
definition of human beings as “*rational* animals”, which attributes to
humans alone a distinctive character. Humans are also quite different
than animals when it comes to their respective rights. But here starts a
moot point:

1.  If, in fact, humans have more rights than animals because they are
    the dominant group, then this resembles very much racism or any
    other dominion of one group over the other.
2.  If, by contrast, humans have more rights than animals because they
    are *different* than animals, then what does this difference consist
    of? If it amounts to rationality, should psychically empaired human
    beings have no rights?

Since after the end of the Nazi experiments a (more or less) general
consensus has been achieved about the fact that psychically empaired
human beings deserve the same rights, one is led back either to No. 1 or
to a different basis of the human claim for rights. This could be Peter
Singer’s claim that one’s moral stand should be calculated not on the
basis of one’s ability to reach a soteriological goal or one’s rational
value but on the basis of **one’s ability of experiencing pain** (Singer
1975). This includes psychically empaired human beings. But it also
includes at least many animals (one might argue about the fact that many
invertebrates with no nerve ganglia cannot literally speaking
*experience* pain).

The discussion about the inclusion of animals within the realm of beings
to whom human rights can be ascribed, thus, seems to hit a nerve in
Western thought. It seems that no straight line can be legitimately
drawn to separate animals and humans and that there is more a net of
family resemblances than a straight opposition between the two groups (a
dolphin or a gorilla, just to take an obvious example, seem to me to
resemble a human being much more than they resemble an amoeba, although
all three can be used for the sake of medical research or kept in
zoo-like institutions).

The situation is slighly different in other traditions of thought. In
Classical Chinese Confucian philosophy, for instance, the idea that we
have stronger obligations towards the members of our extended family and
towards further “proximate” people is a viable option and one could
easily extend this model to animals, so that it would be legitimate to
attribute rights first to the members of our families, then to members
of our communities, then to further human beings, then to pet-animals,
then to further animals with whom we are somehow connected and only at
last to further animals. However, this option clashes with the Western
ambition of building a universal ethical system, does not it?

I wrote about Indian reflections on this topic in a forthcoming article
(a preliminary draft of which is available
[here](https://www.academia.edu/8544445/Systematizing_an_absent_category_discourses_on_nature_in_Pr%C4%81bh%C4%81kara_M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81)),
where I basically argue that most Indian thinkers seem to see non-human
and human animals along a hierarchical sequence with no brisk
interruption.  
Daya Krishna connects this with the utilitaristic approach to knowledge
which characterises most Indian explicit reflections about it:

> The usual Indian analysis is centered around the hedonistic view of
> human nature which sees it as naturally seeking pleasure and avoding
> pain and has a pragmatic view of knowledge which sees the \`truth’ of
> knowledge in terms of its ability to avoid pain and afford pleasure to
> the humanking. But on this view no distinction is possible between the
> human and the animal world as the latter also is supposed to seek
> pleasure or avoid pain and \`sees’ the \`truth’ of its knowledge in
> terms of the \`success’ achieved by it in this enterprise. In fact,
> the whole learning theory in modern psychology and the training of
> animals is based on this premiss (2004, p. 237)

Let me just add that Daya Krishna is thinking of the first aphorism in
the foundational text of the Nyāya school (NS 1.1.1), where knowledge is
linked to the achievement of one’s *summum bonum*. In another
philosophical school, the Mīmāṃsā, animals are also considered on the
same level as humans when it comes to the fact of desiring happiness
(PMS chapter 6).
