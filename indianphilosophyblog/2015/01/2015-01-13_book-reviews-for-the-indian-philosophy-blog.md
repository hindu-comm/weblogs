Book reviews for the Indian Philosophy Blog

I am happy to announce that I will be serving as the Book Review Editor
for the Indian Philosophy Blog. I’d like to invite everyone to check
out our new [Book Review
Guidelines](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/book-reviews/).

The distinctive thing about book reviews on our blog, as opposed to
reviews in traditional journals, is that we will invite authors of the
books being reviewed to read the review and everyone (authors,
reviewers, members of the blog community, and guests) will be encouraged
to take part in discussions concerning the books under review.

So if you are reading a book about Indian philosophy, why not write a
small review that might generate a discussion with interesting people?
It doesn’t have to be long (we’re aiming for 500-700 words, but it
could be shorter or longer as needed), and it need not be in-depth
(although it should include something beyond a mere summary of the
chapters of the book).

If you are interested, please see the [Book Review
Guidelines](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/book-reviews/).
