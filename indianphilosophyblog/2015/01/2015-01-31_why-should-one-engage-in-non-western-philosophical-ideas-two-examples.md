Why should one engage in non-Western philosophical ideas? Two examples

A few days back, I discussed
([here](http://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/why-testing-logic-or-philosophy-in-general-on-non-western-ideas.html)))
why one should test one’s logical hypotheses against something alien, be
it a Medieval paradox or a Sanskrit text (or anything in between).

Today, I came back to the same thought while reading Adriano Mannino’s
[post](http://crucialconsiderations.org/rationality/theism-and-expert-knowledge/#comment-72)
about the diffusion of theism among philosophers of religion. Adriano
discusses the worries of some philosophers who think that “philosophy of
religion” is in fact a disguised Christian apologetic and is, therefore,
not philosophical at all. Personally, I think that apologetics can be
(and often are) philosophically interesting, but should philosophers of
religion want to reply to this attack, they could try to engage in
religions and theologies different than their own or at least different
than the Christian one. (By the way, if you are looking for an excuse to
start doing it, have a look at
[this](https://asiaticacoffeebreak.wordpress.com/2015-2/) call for
papers).

**What are your favorite examples of the need of engaging with
non-Western, non-contemporary, non-mainstream philosophical ideas?**
