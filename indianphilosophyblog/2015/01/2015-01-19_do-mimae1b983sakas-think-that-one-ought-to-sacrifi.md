Do Mīmāṃsakas think that one “Ought to sacrifice”, or that one “Ought to sacrifice, given the condition x applies”?

I am currently working with some amazing colleagues at the Vienna
University of Technology on the formalisation of Mīmāṃsā deontic logic
(for further information, read
[this](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/10/20/a-non-funded-project-on-deontic-logic-and-some-general-notes-on-peer-reviewing-projects/)
post). One of the problems we are facing is that duties prescribed in
Vedic prescriptions appear to be interpreted as regarding only specific
eligible people, the *adhikārin*s. For instance, one needs to perform a
Kārīrī sacrifice *if one desires rain*, so that the duty to perform it
does not apply generally to all. Even in the case of a sacrifice one has
to perform throughout one’s life, such as the Agnihotra, the same
restriction applies, since Mīmāṃsā authors interpret it as meaning that
one has to perform it *if one desires happiness*, i.e., throughout one’s
life, since one always desires happiness.

This led us (in fact, Björn) to imagine a binary version of the “Ought”
operator, e.g.

> O (A/B)

which can be read as “One ought to do A, if one is in the situation B”.

Now, the problem is: How to interpret the “/B” part?  
As far as I can see, there are at least three possible solutions:

-   Read it as meaning “provided you desire that…”. This will in fact
    cover most cases. However, it will not cover instances such as the
    distinction between the application of, e.g., “Don’t tell lies”
    (*nānṛtaṃ vadet*) to the person of the sacrificer, or to the ritual
    context of the Darśapūrṇamāsa only (see ŚBh ad 3.4.12–13). One might
    try to construe also these cases as meaning, respectively, “provided
    any possible desire” and “provided that you desire *x*” (with x=the
    same desire prompting the Darśapūrṇamāsa). **But this forces a
    little bit the framework of desire, since desiring that x, does not
    immediately mean performing the corresponding sacrifice. Moreover,
    in this way the distinction between prescriptions applying to the
    person and to the action is blurred**.

-   Read it as meaning “provided the situation x”, with this situation
    being in the case of the Kārīrī “the desire of rain”, in the case of
    prescriptions regarding the sacrificer as person “T” (=any possible
    situation) and in yet the case of the prohibition to tell lies
    “during the DPM”. **A problem with this interpretation is that** it
    is difficult not to interpret  

    > O (not to tell lies/DPM)

    as a subset of

    > O (not to tell lies/T)

    which means that **we could never have a case in which something is
    prohibited (or prescribed) for T but there are particular
    prescriptions enjoining exceptions** (one can immediately recall the
    problem of violence and the fact that it is generally prohibited,
    but prescribed in the case of the Agnīṣomīya). A further problem is
    that the different applicability of the prohibition to tell lies
    (etc.) are not described by Śabara as referring to a more or less
    extended portion of the same range of applicability, but rather as
    referring to two different sets (in one case: the person of the
    sacrificer, in the other: the action itself).

-   Read it as meaning different things. In one case “/B” would be
    interpreted as meaning one’s desire, in others as referring to
    either a specific ritual context or the generality of one’s being a
    person. **But is such a different interpretation of the same
    operator justifiable?**

A slight change has occurred, however, insofar as Francesco
[Genco](http://www.logic.at/staff/) has joined the group, and we are not
working on linguistic issues for the time being.
