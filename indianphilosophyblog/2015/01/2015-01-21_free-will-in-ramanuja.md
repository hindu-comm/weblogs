Free will in Rāmānuja

As frequently observed, free will was not a main topic in Indian
philosophy, and discussions about it need rather to be looked for either
at partly unexpected places (e.g., within logical discussions about
agency) or in texts which are not primarily philosophical and in their
commentaries, most notably the *Mahābhārata* and especially the
*Bhagavadgītā*. Nonetheless, a precious exception is offered by a
passage in a 11th c. theologian and philosopher, namely in Rāmānuja’s
*Vedārthasaṅgraha*, which focuses on a constellation of topics quite
similar to the one Western readers are accustomed to.

In fact, an objector staged by Rāmānuja observes that if God is
omnipotent, then there can be no human being who is fully responsible of
his or her action.

What is specifical for the South Asian theological discourse is the fact
that this, in turn, leads to the conclusion that there can be no
*adhikārin*. The *adhikārin* is the person who is eligible to perform a
given ritual and that is consequently responsible for carrying it out.
In order for one to be an *adhikārin*, one should be able to actually
carry out the action (e.g., a physically disabled person cannot be an
*adhikārin*), but this is in fact something which lies beyond each
person’s possibilities, says Rāmānuja’s opponent, since one can only act
if God makes him or her act.

By contrast, common to Western speculations on free will is the appeal
to Sacred texts stating that there is no such thing as free will:

> He alone causes the person whom He wishes to lead out of these worlds,
> to perform a good deed. He alone causes the person whom He wishes to
> fall down to perform an evil deed
>
> (*eṣa eva sādhukarma kārayati taṃ yam ebhyo lokebhya unninīṣati, eṣa
> eva asādhukarma kārayati tam yam adho ninīṣati*, Kauśitaki Upaniṣad
> 3.8).

Even more striking is the conclusion driven by Rāmānuja’s opponent:

> Thus, since He is the one who causes \[people\] to perform good or
> evil deeds, He is cruel.(*sādhvasādhukarmakārayitṛtvāt nairghṛṇyaṃ
> ca.*)

Rāmānuja’s answer to this (powerful) objection is worth quoting in full:

> \[R:\] To this, we answer: The Supreme Self arranged for all conscious
> beings in a general way (i.e., he just gave each conscious being the
> presuppositions for acting, without interfering with one’s intentions)
> the whole multitude of undertakings and ceasings consisting of the
> connection with the power to think, the connection with the power to
> undertake and \[the connection with the power to cease\]. He then
> entered \[into each conscious being\] being their support in order to
> realise these \[powers\] and He rules as one who permits \[that each
> conscious being undertakes the action s/he wants to undertake\]. In
> this way, He remains the Entire to which all parts belong.
>
> Therefore, \[each conscious being\], having received the power \[to
> think, undertake or cease an action\], undertakes, ceases to act or
> \[thinks\] from himself/herself alone. The Supreme Self observes the
> one who does so without interfering (\\emph{udāsin}). Therefore,
> everything is logical.
>
> In contrast \[to what the opponent claimed\], the fact of causing to
> do good or evil acts is the content of a specific arrangement, it is
> not generally directed to all.

> ityādisarvaṃ pravṛttinivṛttiparikaraṃ sāmānyena saṃvidhāya,

Rāmānuja’s solution implies a double level of interpretation,
ontological and ethical. On the former, Rāmānuja is an upholder of
Viśiṣṭādvaita, i.e., a form of Vedānta according to which nothing exist
but God *and* His attributes. Included within the latter category are
the world and all individuals. Thus, God is present as the substrate of
each individual. Can an attribute of God develop any action
independently of Him? Surely not. What, however, an individual attribute
can develop independently is the thought, or the resolution to act or
cease to act. In other words, the individuals constitute God’s physical
body in their physicality, whereas their psychic component appears to be
independently able to conceive thoughts. Accordingly, **God performs
what humans have only desired or thought**.
