Virtual Sanskrit reading group:  Arthāpatti in the Mānameyodaya

The *Mānameyodaya* is the standard primer for Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā
epistemology. It is written in the clear style of other 17th c. primers
and it is smooth and agreeable to read. These are just some of the
reasons for choosing it for the first meeting of a virtual Sanskrit
reading group initated by Malcolm Keating (see
[this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/01/06/virtual-sanskrit-reading-group/http://)
post, **which is also an open invitation for anyone to join**). More in
detail, we started reading the section on *arthāpatti*, which is an
instrument of knowledge accepted by (Pūrva and Uttara) Mīmāṃsakas, but
considered as a subset of inference by Naiyāyikas and other schools.
*Arthāpatti* is the postulation of the only possible solution out of a
seeming contradiction, e.g. “Devadatta is alive” and “Devadatta is not
in the place where we usually see him” (this is expressed in Sanskrit
epistemology by “Devadatta is not at home”, in contemporary terms we
could think of something like “What happened of Jim? He is not in his
office!”). Different contemporary scholars have tried to discuss the
relation of *arthāpatti* with ‘presumption’ and ‘inference to the best
explanation’. The following is a translation of the beginning of the
*arthāpatti* section in the *Mānameyodaya*:

**1. DEFINITION OF *ARTHĀPATTI***

> “*Arthāpatti* is the postulation of \[something\] producing \[a
> solution\] when there is a logical impossibility”: this is the
> definition explained in the Śābara Bhāṣya \|\| 128 \|\|

As for this definition, the “logical impossibility” is said to be the
contradiction between two \[types\* of\] instruments of knowledge.
Therefore, the following definition \[of the *arthāpatti*\] should be
taught:

> *Arthāpatti* is defined as the cognition of something
> non-contradictory caused by the contradiction between instruments of
> knowledge about general topics, and ones about a specific topic \|\|
> 129 \|\| For instance, the postulation of being outside of home due to
> the contradiction, which is instrumental \[for the arousal of
> postulation\], between the knowledge of his not being at home and the
> knowledge of his being alive \|\| 130 \|\|

One understands in general that Devadatta is alive, either at home or
outside, due to an inference based on astrology (i.e., because out of
astrological calculations one knows that he will live a long life).
There being a contradiction with the fact that he is not at home, one
hypothesises —for the sake of the non-contradiction— that he must be
out. And this is an *arthāpatti*-cognition whose instrument is the
contradiction between the two \[types\] of instruments of knowledge.

**2. NAIYĀYIKA POSITION: THE *ARTHĀPATTI* IS A FORM OF *ANUMĀNA***

> However, the experts of logic (i.e., the Naiyāyikas), thinking that
> this (*arthapatti*) is a form of inference, say that \| “there is no
> contradiction between the two \[types of\] instruments of knowledge.
> And this (non-contradiction) is the same in the case of everything
> well-known” (NKu 3.11)\|\| 131 \|\|

\[Nai:\] To begin with, it is impossible that there is a contradiction
between instruments of knowledge, since there would be the undesirable
consequence that one of the two is not an instrument of knowledge, as in
the case of “this is silver, this is not silver” (where one of the two
ends up being recognised as not valid). \[Obj.\] But nonetheless, one
*does* see a contradiction between the two knowledges about which we
spoke before (in the case of Devadatta)! \[Naiyāyika:\] This is just a
wish! In fact, in the case at hand, the room for doubt\*\* regarding the
specific place, namely ‘is he at home or outside?’ is blocked by the
knowledge of his not being at home. \**dvaya* must refer to two *types*
of instrument of knowledge, and not just to two instruments of
knowledge, given that the next verse explains that the contradiction may
be between a specific knowledge and several general ones
(*sādharaṇapramāṇānām*). Thanks to Andrew Ollett for having discussed
this issue with me. \*\*The Naiyāyika is here speaking of doubt instead
of logical inconsistency, probably because the former, unlike the
latter, is among the *padārtha*s his school accepts.
