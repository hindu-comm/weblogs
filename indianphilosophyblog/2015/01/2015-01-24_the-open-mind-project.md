The Open Mind Project

Evan Thompson has kindly alerted us to a very interesting development,
the Open Mind project, which just went live:<http://open-mind.net>.
From the “About” page:

> This is an edited collection of 39 original papers and as many
> commentaries and replies. . . Besides offering a cross-section of
> ongoing, cutting-edge research in philosophy and cognitive science,
> this collection is also intended to be a free electronic resource for
> teaching. It therefore also contains a selection of online supporting
> materials, pointers to video and audio files and to additional free
> material supplied by the 92 authors represented in this volume. We
> will add more multimedia material, a searchable literature database,
> and tools to work with the online version in the future. All
> contributions to this collection are strictly open access. They can be
> downloaded, printed, and reproduced by anyone.

Of special interest to our own readers is Evan’s own paper, “[Dreamless
Sleep, the Embodied Mind, and Consciousness: The Relevance of a
Classical Indian Debate to Cognitive
Science](http://open-mind.net/papers/dreamless-sleep-the-embodied-mind-and-consciousness-the-relevance-of-a-classical-indian-debate-to-cognitive-science).”
Evan masterfully illustrates how to bring a very “classical” debate in
India into conversation with contemporary cognitive science. His
abstract:

> One of the major debates in classical Indian philosophy concerned
> whether consciousness is present or absent in dreamless sleep. The
> philosophical schools of Advaita Vedānta and Yoga maintained that
> consciousness is present in dreamless sleep, whereas the Nyāya school
> maintained that it is absent. Consideration of this debate, especially
> the reasoning used by Advaita Vedānta to rebut the Nyāya view, calls
> into question the standard neuroscientific way of operationally
> defining consciousness as “that which disappears in dreamless sleep
> and reappears when we wake up or dream.” The Indian debate also offers
> new resources for contemporary philosophy of mind. At the same time,
> findings from cognitive neuroscience have important implications for
> Indian debates about cognition during sleep, as well as for Indian and
> Western philosophical discussions of the self and its relationship to
> the body. Finally, considerations about sleep drawn from the Indian
> materials suggest that we need a more refined taxonomy of sleep states
> than that which sleep science currently employs, and that
> contemplative methods of mind training are relevant for advancing the
> neurophenomenology of sleep and consciousness.
