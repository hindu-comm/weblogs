Keywords: jnā– and vid–

In the last week, two students have asked me about the distinction
between *jñā-* and *vid-* and this made me think that it might be worth
adding a new section to Andrew’s collaborative enterprise (see
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/07/14/keywords-bhava%E1%B8%A5/)
and
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/02/23/tricky-words-prap/))
of mapping the technical vocabulary of Sanskrit. Since *jñā-* (and its
derivatives, such as *jñāna*) and *vid-* (and *vidyā*, etc.) have
different acceptations in various areas of Sanskrit, let me state, once
again, that I will only focus on śāstric, philosophical Sanskrit.  
To begin with, let me state that *jñā-* is the most common and most
generic way to refer to the semantic field of knowing. It is thus, like
*artha* in another field, a valuable place-holder for almost any other
verb, since all cognising activities, from the sense-perceptual grasping
to the illusory conceptualising, can be referred to as instances of
*jñā-*. However, more in detail:

-   *vid-* is etymologically linked with the act of seeing (as in
    Ancient Greek οἶδα, literally ‘I have seen’, but used in the sense
    of ‘I know’). It thus indicates what one has experienced and thus
    **knows** for sure. Moreover, *vid-* indicates a **lasting**
    knowledge, one which is valid and which one will be able to keep in
    one’s memory for at least a long time. Accordingly, the *vidyā*s are
    branches of learning, like the German *Wissenschaften*. Long story
    short, use verbs such as ‘to know’ to translate it.
-   *jñā-*, by contrast, indicates an *act of cognition* (as shown by
    B.K. Matilal). It is thus **not necessarily valid** and it is
    **instantaneous**. One performs an act of *jñā-* when one
    erroneously grasps water in the desert, or when one dreams. And the
    single *jñāna*s are just single ‘cognitions’ which one does not keep
    forever. *vijñāna* may add to that a nuance of ‘discriminative,
    dialectic cognition’, which makes it necessarily valid, but the
    distinction between *jñāna* and *vijñāna* is a moot issue, as proved
    by the commentaries on the one or the other. Long story short, use
    verbs such as ‘to cognize’ to translate *jñā-*.
