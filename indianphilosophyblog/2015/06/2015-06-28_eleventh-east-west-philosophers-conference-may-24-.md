Eleventh East-West Philosophers’ Conference: May 24-31, 2016

The Eleventh East-West Philosophers’ Conference will be held in
Honolulu, Hawai’i on May 24-31, 2016. The theme of the conference is
“Place.” **The deadline for panel and paper submissions is November 1,
2015.** Please see the [Call for Papers at Warp, Weft, and
Way](http://warpweftandway.com/west-philosophers-conference/) for more
information.

I attended the previous conference in 2011, which was a wonderful
experience (I may be biased, having done my MA at the University of
Hawai’i). Hopefully some members of our blog community will be present
at the next one in 2016!
