What is arthāpatti?

Compared to the pramāṇa of pratyakṣa (perception) oranumāna
(inferential reasoning), arthāpatti (postulation or presumption) has
received less attention in contemporary secondary literature. This is
unfortunate, since it is broadly recognized as a pramāṇa, whether as a
sui generis one, as by Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta, or as a type of anumāna, as
by Nyāya. As well, it is an important pramāṇa for the interpretation of
Vedic texts and its purported non-reducibility to anumāṇa raises
interesting questions about the relationship between epistemology and
logic.In this short post I want to raise the question of how we should
think about arthāpatti by laying out the interpretive territory through
secondary literature. Some
[earlier](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/04/28/arthapatti-and-the-kevalavyatirekin-anumana/)
[posts](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/02/27/why-are-postulation-arthapatti-and-inference-not-the-same-thing/)
have taken on the major primary texts, so I will leave that aside here.

Basically,arthāpatti is the kind of reasoning that allows us to reason
from

> \(1\) “Fat Devadatta does not eat during the day.”

to

> Fat Devadatta eats at night.

and

> \(2\) Caitra is alive; I see that Caitra is not at home.

to

> Caitra is living somewhere outside of his home.

The central idea is that there is some kind of tension which arises from
a new fact being cognized, against the background of another fact, which
cannot be resolved without the postulation of third fact. In example (1)
above, the tension is between Devadatta being fat and his not eating
during the day. In (2), it is between Caitra’s being alive and Caitra’s
not being at home. The tension is not strict logical inconsistency, (p &
\~p) but something else–just how to analyze this is something on which
Indian thinkers differ.

**Major Questions and Literature Overview  
**There are a few questionswhose answers will carve up the conceptual
territory.

1.  Is there one arthāpatti or many?
2.  If there are many arthāpatti-s, whatdistinctions are there?
3.  Is arthāpatti (or arthāpatti-s)apramāṇa? (If many, are all
    pramāṇa?)
4.  If it is a pramāṇa, is it sui generis or in virtue of reducing to
    another?
5.  If it is a pramāṇa, what is its “trigger”, doubt or conflict?
6.  Is arthāpatti deductive or non-deductive?

The most familiar distinction inarthāpattiis between śrūta- and
dṛṣṭa-, distinguished based on whether the bits of knowledge that
jump-start the processare testimonially-given orexperientially given.
However, one can also distinguish inśrūta-arthāpattibetween abhihita
and abhidhāna. The former is wherewhat isanupapatti (unintelligible or
inexplicable) is the facts expressed and the latter where it is the
expression itself.

Kanaujia 1992 rejects the distinction between śrūta and dṛṣta, and
insteadproposes three major kinds of arthāpattibased on (1) linguistic
unintelligibility, (2) factual unintelligibility, (3) unintelligibility
of contradiction, subdividing (2) into (a) explanatory unintelligibility
and (b) psychological unintelligibility, where there is only a partial
clash between two facts. These types do not entirely map onto
distinctions in the primary texts. Kanaujia’s aimis to demonstrate that
arthāpatti is a heterogeneous concept in the original sources which must
be more carefully analyzed.As a result of these distinctions, Kanaujia
argues that only some of the sub-types are pramāṇa-s, and some are
reducible to anumāṇa.

Bharadwaja 1988 and 1990 (Chapter 4) does not make such a distinction
among kinds of arthāpatti but thinks that it is simply a matter of
contextual interpretation–and thus not a pramāṇa at all.Chinchore and
Chinchore 1984 argue that arthāpatti is a pramāṇa, and in fact a sui
generis one (contra the Nyāya position). They, too, emphasize the
linguistic nature of arthāpatti, claiming that it is essentiallya
“semantic gap” which needs to be filled in.

Yoshimizu 2007 says something similar, that arthāpatti ispropositional
derivation, a kind of reasoning in which one sentence is deduced from
another sentence. He proposes a formalization of some of the most common
stock examples of arthāpatti, those found in Kumāila, to make his point.
Like Yoshimizu, Barlingay 1965 attempts some formalization of
arthāpatti,arguingthat postulation is a truth-functional deductive
argument. He analyzes it in terms of semantic implication, modus ponens,
and disjunctive syllogism.Rastogi 1983’s brief treatment (in an
appendix to the text) alsosays something similar, though without the
formalization, saying that arthāpatti is a semantic implication whose
conclusion is necessary.

One ofthe most commonly cited and earliest works on arthāpatti isDatta
1932. He defends its independence as a pramāna but unlike Yoshimizu and
Barlingay, he thinks that arthāpatti isequivalent to hypothesis and
transcendental argument. To the objection that this would strip
arthāpatti of its being a pramāṇa (since more than one hypothesis is
possible in any given situation), he responds that, just like anumāna
can be misapplied, so can arthāpatti. When arthāpatti arrives at the
truth, it is a pramāṇa. This is along the lines of Taber’s 2009 review
of Yoshimizu’s article, in which he says that arthāpatti is pointing in
the direction of non-deductive inference such as inference to the best
explanation (IBE). Maiti 1939 says something similar,that there is a
difference of degree, but not of kind, between hypothetical reasoning
and arthāpatti, due to the greater degree of certainty in the latter.
More recently,Kasturirangan et al 2011 have taken up this question,
arguing that arthāpatti is not IBE, since its conclusion necessarily
follows from the premises, although they agree that it is also not
reducible to anumāna.

**Moving Forward – Methodological Question  
**Given this (very brief survey), I want to raise methodological some
questions about how to move forward in understanding
arthāpatti.Kanaujia says the following (see image):[![Screen Shot

What should our approach be to understanding arthāpatti in light of its
various definitions and examples in the original literature? How should
we employ various formal apparatuses in our analysis? Do you have a
preferred analysis of arthāpatti that is not represented here?
