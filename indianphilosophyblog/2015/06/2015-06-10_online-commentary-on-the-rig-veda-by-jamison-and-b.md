Online commentary on the Rig Veda by Jamison and Brereton

From the INDOLOGY list-serv:

Dear colleagues,

As some of you know, Stephanie Jamison and I have been working on a more
detailed and technical commentary on the Jamison-Brereton RV
translation. The obvious place to put something like this is the web,
since it can be posted piecemeal and updated to incorporate suggestions
from the outside and second or third thoughts of the translators. Weâ€™ve
been working with the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities, and the first
installments (from Stephanie) are now up. Currently it includes comments
on hymns from Ma??ala I up to I.115 and on the Indra hymns in VII and
VIII; we expect the complete commentary to require some years. The site
is

<http://rigvedacommentary.alc.ucla.edu/>

Please feel free to share this with anyone who might be interested.

The site is not set up not to receive comments, but we would welcome
suggestions sent directly to either or both of us. If we incorporate
them in the commentary, we will do so with due attribution.

Best wishes,

Joel Brereton
