Are words an instrument of knowledge?

Are words an instrument of knowledge? And, if so, what sort of? Are they
an instance of inference insofar as one infers the meaning on the basis
of the words used? Or are they are an independent instrument of
knowledge, since the connection between words and meanings is not of
inferential nature?

Kumārila discusses the topic in the *Śabdapariccheda* ‘Chapter on Words’
(or ‘Chapter on Linguistic Communication’) of his *Ślokavārttika*
(henceforth ŚV). The chapter is the first one focusing specifically on
language of the ŚV and in this sense it needs to hint to various
arguments which will be elaborated upon in various successive chapters.
Accordingly, in the same chapter Kumārila addresses Sāṅkhya, Naiyāyika,
other Mīmāṃsaka, and Vaiśeṣika and Buddhist opponents.

I have dealt with the first group of opponents (of the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya
and Mīmāṃsā schools) in this
[post](http://elisafreschi.com/2015/03/09/a-pathway-through-kumarilas-slokavarttika-sabda-chapter-part-1/).
Against the Buddhist opponents, Kumārila’s strategy is to first show
that no inference (in the technical sense of the Sanskrit *anumāna*) can
be formalised in the case of word and meaning. Instead, words are
described as being an independent instrument of knowledge. Then,
however, two dramatic turns occur:

1.  Kumārila candidly admits that he has only provisionally accepted
    that the words are instruments of knowledge. Instead, words are in
    fact not an instrument of knowledge. Only sentences are. Words,
    rather, repeat what has been acquired through another instrument of
    knowledge or function as recollectors (*smāraka*).
2.  Next, Kumārila even more candidly admits that words can indeed be an
    instance of inference. This is nonetheless no problem for the
    advocates of Linguistic Communication as an instrument of knowledge
    since *sentences*, not words are the vehicles for knowledge.

This is not the first case in which Kumārila is ready to abandon a
thesis in order to save a more general point (see John Taber’s *Kumārila
On Perception* regarding perception and Erich Frauwallner’s *Bhāvanā und
Vidhiḥ bei Maṇḍanamiśra* regarding the role of root and verbal ending in
communicating the *bhāvanā*).

**Does it mean that Kumārila is often chiefly a polemist? Or that he
focuses more on other issues (in this case, more on the authority of the
Veda)?**
