Philosophy East and West, Volume 65, Issue 2

The latest issue of *Philosophy East and West* is out. The website isn’t
updated yet, but the hardcopy is in hand. It’s nice to see some of our
Blog members amongst the contributors. Ethan Mills has an article
“Jayarāśi’s Delightful Destruction of Epistemology.” Andrew Ollett has a
review of Elisa Freschi’s *Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā* and Doug Berger has a review of Chakravarthi
Ram-Prasad’s*Divine Self, Human Self.
