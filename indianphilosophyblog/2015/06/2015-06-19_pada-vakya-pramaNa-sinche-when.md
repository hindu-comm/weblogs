pada-vākya-pramāṇa… Since when? (with updated reference)

If you have read post-Classical śāstra, you will have certainly
encountered the formulation above, describing the three foundational
disciplines as focusing on  
**words** (*pada*), i.e., grammatical analysis in Vyākaraṇa  
**sentences** (*vākya*), i.e., textual linguistics in Mīmāṃsā  
**means of knowledge** (*pramāṇa*), i.e., epistemology in Nyāya

The tripartition is handy and catchy, but clearly post-classic, also
since the idea of distinguishing schools according to their “forte” and
studying each of them in a technical way is probably itself
post-classical. Thus, when did the tripartition originate, and by whom?
When and where did it become standard?  
As for the first question, until now, I have encountered it in Jayanta
(10th c. Kashmīr), in a non-standard form, so that it may be thought
that Jayanta lies just before its standardization.  
As for the last question, in the following quote by Veṅkaṭanātha (13th
c. Tamil Nadu) the standardisation seems complete:

> The knowers of the śāstra divide the śāstra into three, according to
> the division into words, sentences and means of knowledge.
>
> (*padavākyapramāṇabhedena hi tredhā vibhajanti śāstraṃ śāstravidaḥ*)

**When and wher did you encounter this tripartition first?**

UPDATE: You can read further references to the same compound in Mukula
Bhaṭṭa (Kashmir, 9th–10th c.), Śaṅkara and Bāṇa (7th c.)
