Unchaste literature and the “social aesthetic”

Satyanarayana asked a very interesting
[question](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/09/26/a-readers-query/)
a while back. Literature (*kāvya*) was widely believed to be a kind of
moral education, even if it “seduces us like a lover”
(*kāntasaṃmitatayā*); other types of texts, namely scripture (*śāstra*)
and sacred lore (*purāṇa*–*itihāsa*) are even more directly didactic.
But there is quite a lot of literature in Sanskrit and Prakrit that
could be thought to *undermine* basic social and ethical values.
Satyanarayana drew our attention to the *topos* of the *asatī*, the
“unfaithful woman,” who is often presented sympathetically—indeed, in
poems of devotion to Kṛṣṇa, the unfaithful women who cavort with Kṛṣṇa
are actually “divinized.” What gives? Are we reading the literature
wrong? Or do Bhoja and other theorists who assign literature an
ethico-didactic function have too puritanical a view of it?

Let’s assume that “being unfaithful” is bad. If literature is to
instruct us as moral subjects, then one of the messages we’re supposed
to get out of it is “one should not be unfaithful.” But as Satyanarayana
pointed out, the *Sattasaī*—which, incidentally, was one of Bhoja’s
favorite texts—very often depicts men and women arranging illicit
affairs. The *Sattasaī* very rarely censures or condones this kind of
behavior explicitly. This contrasts with the Rāma story, where the
virtuous Rāma is shown to prevail over the dissolute and lustful Rāvaṇa.
The single-verse vignettes of the *Sattasaī* thus don’t lead directly to
an moral judgment like “one should not be unfaithful.”

But then again, isn’t this precisely what separates literature from mere
sermonizing? I have been interested lately in the various “meanings”
that are found in literary texts, and above all in the *Sattasaī*, and
here is something that everyone agrees on: there’s a lot of these
meanings, even in a single verse, and sometimes they even contradict
each other. (The famous example is the verse *bhama dhammia*, which
contains both a positive and negative injunction.) One of the main
protocols for reading the verses of the *Sattasaī* was figuring out who
the speaker of the verse is, and who the verse is addressed to. The
verses are often ambivalent themselves, but imagining them to be spoken
by certain stock characters introduces whole new levels of meaning. And
we have a rich commentarial tradition that attests to this way of
reading the text. Let’s take one verse that clearly mentions the
*asatī*, 461 (using the numbering of Weber’s *editio princeps*):

> ua saṃbhamavikkhittaṃ ramiavvaalaṃpaḍāi asaīe  
> ṇavaraṃgaaṃ kuḍaṃge dhaaṃ va diṇṇaṃ aviṇaassa
>
> *Look at that—the unfaithful woman,  
> eager to make love,  
> has thrown her colorful sari over the hedges in a rush,  
> as if giving the banner of victory  
> to her own immodesty.*

The commentator Pītāmbara says that this is what one woman says to
another—and in that scenario, the moral judgment is clear. As an
alternative, however, Pītāmbara suggests that this is what a procuress
(*kuṭṭanī*) says to encourage the woman’s lover, who has just arrived on
the scene and is wondering whether he has missed his appointment.
Pītāmbara offers a few further reflections on this verse; in fact, for
every verse in the anthology, he tries to elicit a moral meaning
(*dharma*), a social meaning (*nīti*), and a spiritual meaning
(*yukti*). Here the moral meaning is that “immodesty” can only happen
when you stray from the right path, which you shouldn’t do anyway; the
social meaning is that when you rush through things you’ll end up
ruining them; and the spiritual meaning is that seekers of liberation
should abandon desire since it will lead them into immodesty. Obviously,
Pītāmbara is reading these verses from the perspective of conventional
morality, and it is debatable whether he’s drawing meanings out of the
text or putting them in.

But why should poetry about immodesty, unfaithfulness, and other morally
questionable things have held the interest of so many people for such a
long time? Is it really because (as Satyanarayana quotes Wendy Doniger
as saying) these poems were a “fantasy”of licentiousness for their staid
authors? I have nothing to say about that hypothesis, but there is at
least one alternative. Let’s look at 104:

> ṇippacchimāi asaī dukkhāloāi mahuaapupphāiṃ  
> cīe baṃdhussa va aṭṭhiāi ruirī samuccei
>
> *The faithless woman cries  
> as she gathers the final flowers of the* madhūka *tree,  
> painful to look upon,  
> as if they were the bones of a loved one  
> on the funeral pyre.*

The “point” of this verse, if I can be so blunt, is the realization that
the woman is grieving over the loss of her trysting place under the
cover of the *madhūka* tree. It is figuring out someone’s internal
state, their*bhāva* as this figure is known, from their actions. Is
there condemnation here? Only if you think that the word *asatī* is
automatically a condemnation. I think the *Sattasaī*‘s interest in the
*asatī* comes less from her moral dissolution than her desire to keep
her affairs, and her feelings, hidden from the world—and the challenges
of narration and representation that this kind of secrecy poses. What we
see in this verse are just what other people in the village see; it is
our job to figure out what’s going on. (I unfortunately don’t have
Pītāmbara’s commentary for this section of the text; it would be
interesting to see the dramatic situation that he invents.) The *asatī*
is a case-study in *vakratā*: not just moral “crookedness,” but the
indirection of gestures and speech that makes literature interesting.

The idea that the *Sattasaī* undermines conventional morality depends on
a conflation of the values of the text with the values of its
characters. My feeling is that there is a close relationship between
these sets of values—but the text’s values are *literary*, not ethical.
Indeed the anonymous characters depicted in the *Sattasaī*, mostly
farmers and villagers, would never be considered to be exemplary moral
subjects in the social world that the readers of Sanskrit and Prakrit
literature inhabited. This moral distance allows a kind of literary
magic to happen: the characters’ secrets become puzzles for us, as
readers, to solve; their strategies of dissimulation and indirection
come to represent a major part of the literary enterprise.

Catullus [wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_16):

> nam castum esse decet pium poetam  
> ipsum, versiculos nihil necessest

“Of course a pious poet himself should be moral, but that’s not at all
necessary for his verses.”
