Congratulations to Jonardon Ganeri

From
[dailynous](http://dailynous.com/2015/11/16/jonardon-ganeri-wins-infosys-prize/):

[Jonardon
Ganeri](http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/JonardonGaneri.html) (NYU)
is the winner of the 2015 [Infosys
Prize](http://www.infosys-science-foundation.com/prize/index.asp) in the
humanities category. It is the first time a philosopher has won this
prize.

*The jury panel, headed by Harvard professor and Nobel Laureate Amartya
Sen, awarded Ganeri for his outstanding scholarship and originality in
interpreting and scrutinizing analytical Indian Philosophy and shedding
light on shared ground as well as the dichotomy between Indian and Greek
traditions of philosophical reasoning.*

In a [press
release](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-york-university-professor-wins-prestigious-humanities-award-550423411.html),
Sen is quoted as saying:

*“It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Jonardan Ganeri for his
major contributions to Indian analytical philosophy, which stands
shoulder to shoulder with other analytical traditions like the Greek and
the Chinese. But they have often been neglected, partly because of an
excessive focus on the religious and mystical aspects of Indian
Philosophy. Jonardan Ganeri and his teacher Prof. Bimal Matilal have
done an enormous amount of work to bring that heritage to us to make it
fresh and a lively part of the Indian intellectual thinking today. I
congratulate him with the warmest possible words.”*
