Job Announcement: Acquisitions Editor at SUNY Press

I would like to call your attention to a job opening for an Acquisitions
Editor at SUNY Press in the disciplines of Asian Studies, Religious
Studies, and/or Comparative Philosophy. The Press is willing to hire and
train someone who has an appropriate academic background but who is
relatively new to the field of publishing. The SUNY Press offices are in
Albany, NY. This would be an excellent position for someone holding an
M.A. or Ph.D. in Asian Religions or Asian Philosophy who is interested
in an “alt-ac” job.

This opening comes after the sudden and premature passing away of Nancy
Ellegate, whom many of us will miss very much. Her contributions to our
field were extraordinary. I had been working with her until very
recently in my capacity as a SUNY Press editorial board member.

Please do feel free to share this job notice widely. The link to the
online job application system is
[here](https://systemrf.interviewexchange.com/jobofferdetails.jsp;jsessionid=F684AD8C422327C61DE0D9BE9265837E?JOBID=65355).

Inquiries about this position should not be sent to me, but rather to
SUNY Press Co-Director James Peltz (james.peltz\[at\]sunypress.edu).
