Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy 2015

As promised, this (a bit belated) post summarizes some talks from the
October 2015 Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy in Monterey,
CA. To keep the post brief, I’m choosing to discuss only those SACP
talks which I attended, have good notes on, and which bear on Indian
philosophy. If someone’s talk is omitted, and readers think it should be
discussed here, let us know in the comments. Finally, Ethan Mills will
be talking about the plenary panel he organized, so I will not include
those papers here.

The titles of the papers I will summarizefollow, in the order they were
presented at the SACP:

1.  Ana Laura Funes Madery, University of Hawaii: “Liṅga and Sūkṣma: A
    Feminist Phenomenological Analysis of the Subtle in Classical
    Sāṁkhya (Graduate student first prize paper)”
2.  Chris Chapple, Loyola Marymount University: “Prakṛti, Cudala,
    Pārvatā and the Construct of Feminine Power”
3.  Geoff Ashton, University of Colorado: “Ardhanārīśvara or the Lord of
    Dance who is Half-Woman: Performative Liberation and Divine
    Androgeny in Kashmir Śaivism”
4.  Veena Howard, California State University, Fresno, “Queen
    Gāndhārī’s Lament in the *Mahābhārata*: Philosophical and Literary
    Perspectives.”
5.  Gino Signoracci, University of New Mexico: “Liberation in Nyāya,
    Sāṁkhya, Vedānta
6.  Itsuki Hayashi, Kyoto University, “Can Flux Bring About Flux: The
    Inconclusiveness Objection against Radical Impermanence and a
    Buddhist Response.”
7.  Purushottama Bilimoria, University of Melbourne, “Frits Staal and
    Daya Krishna: A Tribute to their Counter-Intuitions for Indian and
    Comparative Philosophy.”

If you are one of the presenters and find my summary to be lacking,
please let me know in the comments!

1\. Madery on Liṅga and Sūkṣma

This talk explores the implications ofa phenomenological reading of the
subtle body (sūkṣma), in which “body incorporates its cosmic dimension
and reveals its emotional and dispositional aspects as primordial
constituents without falling into metaphysics.” Using Irigay’s work as a
methodological framework, she claims that the body’s awareness of the
other is inexplicable without pre-existent, immaterial awareness. Her
goal is to reimagine the self-aware body and understand prakṛti as
self-aware, and not unconscious, body.

2\. Chapple on Prakṛti

In this analysis of the roots of Kashmir Śaivism, Chapple discusses its
origins in Sāṁkhya, with the goddess Śrī Lalita being consciousness
itself. The goddess as hṛim-utterer in the *Upaniṣads* can be
understand, with Irigay, as a moment of intimacy, and not merely an
instrument of communication. Given that Pārvatī can be worshipped in
male or female form, there is a collapse of dualism, along with the
goddess’ form being a means of criticising male cultivation of
technologies and emphasis on possession/exchange of objects.

3\. Ashton on Ardhanārīśvara

Beginning witha traditional dichotomy—masculinity as free self vs
feminine as suffering field of action—he explains that it not
necessarily a firm one in indian thought. Understanding Śaivism as a
criticism of Sāṁkhya, it not only gives attitional tattvas in an attempt
to fillout the unexplained presupposition of separation between
puruṣa/prakṛti, but it embeds this metaphysics within a compelling
narrative. This narrative, according to David Lawrence, is “agental”, in
which Śiva as Kapālika is alienated from śakti in order to overcome
dualism and experience union. Ardhanārīśvara as androgynous experiences
the other as being their deepest desire.

4\. Howard on the *Mahābhārata*

Focusing on Queen Gāndhārī’s lament in the *Mahābhārata,* she argues
that itis fruitfully read through the lens of rasa theory,asa means
to prompt the reader into the rasa of karuṇa, which then leads to
śāntarasa. She leans on Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta to elucidate
this process, especially Abhinavagupta who, she notes, views the
experiencing of rasa as a transcendent religious experience, as for him,
śāntarasa is the organizing principle of the Mahābhārata.

5\. Signoracci on Liberation

Drawing on three of the traditional darśana-s, he argues that liberation
is presupposed as the aim of Indian philosophy. He focuses onNyāya,
Sāṁkhya, Advaita Vedānta in particular. In Nyāya, he notes the aim of
apavarga, in which the released ātman is insensate—jivanmūkti is not the
goal, as such living liberation is lesser. In Sāṁkhya, he discusses
kaivalya, observing that it is more soteriologically-focused than Nyāya,
and while jivanmūkti is possible, it is not emphasized. In Advaita
Vedānta, he observes an emphasis on māya and coming to be liberated
while living. His concluding question is what socioeconomic conditions
enabled the focus on liberation in these traditions and, given changing
conditions, what relevance remains?

6\. Hayashi on Flux

This talk gave aclose reading of *Kṣaṇabhaṅgasiddhi-anvayātmika* 5.3to
show that Ratnakīrti’s reply to the Naiyāyika criticism of momentariness
fails,. In reply to the Buddhist’s charge that non-momentary things
cannot be causally efficacious, the Naiyāyika (Bhadanta Yogasena in the
Tattvasaṃgraha) replies that momentariness is likewise problematic as it
is arbitrary when a seed (with or without accompanying upādhi) produces
a sprout. Hayashi examines whether Ratnakīrti’s attempt to index
properties to times, as we might for locations, can explain the causal
patterns which we observe, concluding that it does not.

7\. Billimoria on Krishna & Staal

Within the larger context of Daya Krishna’s understanding of
“comparative philosophy,” Bilimoria focuses on the debate between Staal
and Krishna on whether mantras are meaningless, and in what sense, as
well as Krishna’s discussion of the puruṣārtha-s, and their number. He
argues that Krishna’s response to Staal shows how the latter
misinterpreted Mīmāṃsā, as their concern was not the meaningfulness, but
their functional nature in the ritual context (for instance, as a coded
way of invoking gods by confusing demigods). As for the puruṣārtha-s,
drawing on “The Myth of Puruṣārthas”, he examines Krishna’s argument
that the rational life has been left out.

Rather than attempt to reproduce the question-and-answer periods here, I
encourage you to look to the published work of these philosophers, or
look out for forthcoming papers.
