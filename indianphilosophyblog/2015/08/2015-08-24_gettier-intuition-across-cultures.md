“Gettier” Intuition Across Cultures

No doubt many of you will have seen
[this](http://certaindoubts.com/new-study-no-difference-in-gettier-intuition-across-cultures/)
by now, but for those who have not:

> *Noûs* has just published a truly amazing study on this topic by a
> team of experimental philosophers (Machery, Stich, Rose, Chatterjee,
> Karasawa, Struchiner, Sirker, Usui & Hashimoto), and I think this new
> study gives us a much better understanding of the relevant empirical
> facts. The researchers presented two different Gettier cases to
> participants in the United States, Brazil, India and Japan, yielding a
> total sample size of 521 participants.

I post this because it is relevant to [earlier
conversation](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/03/16/philosophy-and-cultural-diversity-a-follow-up-on-keatings-questions/)
here on the relevance of experimental philosophy for comparative
philosophy and Indian philosophy. In particular, Anand Vaidya writes,
reflecting on the relationship between the three,

> Thus: If the question is: how should classical Indian philosophers
> modify their practice and research in light of these ideas and new
> ways of engaging things? I would say: don’t worry. Nothing here
> changes classical Indian philosophical practice. However, if the
> question is: Can classical Indian philosophers contribute to a new
> enterprise that will help present important ideas from the tradition
> to the public and to other parts of academia? I would say: absolutely.

And on experimental philosophy informing comparative/Indian philosophy,
Stephen Phillips notes in the comments:

> Similarly, what people say about Gettier problems in Delhi or Hong
> Kong does not seem to me to be nearly as relevant for a philosophic
> theory of knowledge as the pramANa theories of classical thinkers,
> which were ironed out over generations. Probably intuitions about
> perception or inference or testimony as possibly erroneous would
> emerge in the course of contemporary interviews, and indeed one can
> find non-factive usages in the epics and elsewhere in Sanskrit
> literature. But, to speak about NyAya, philosophers had their
> intuitions shaped by a theoretical inheritance upon which they then
> built, intuitions that came to restrict an understanding of genuine
> perception, inference, and testimony to that which is true. A
> contemporary theory of knowledge needs to heed such educated
> intuitions if it is not to be hopelessly ethnocentric but not the
> uneducated intuitions reported by anthropologists.

Perhaps readers who have read the article (I have not yet) might have
something to add to this discussion?
