Ashoka University – A Guest Post by Alex Watson



Hi Everyone. Elisa noted that in the Seminar article she recently
blogged about, my job title is given as ‘Professor of Indian Philosophy
at Ashoka University’, and asked me to write about Indian Philosophy
here at Ashoka.

It was not an entirely straightforward decision to leave Harvard, but
one of several factors weighing strongly in favour of Ashoka was that I
will not just be teaching Sanskrit, but also – in fact mainly – courses
on Indian Philosophy. [Ashoka University](http://www.ashoka.edu.in/)
has only recently come into existence; last academic year was the first
year. It’s India’s first exclusively liberal arts University, and it
promises ‘An Ivy League education, right here in India’. It has
attracted superb faculty and great students; every one of my colleagues
and last year’s visiting faculty who I have spoken to about this say
that they are the best students they have taught anywhere in the world.
It’s surprising that they managed to recruit such good students in their
first year, before any reputation could be established. Perhaps part of
the reason is that students were attracted to the international faculty;
and perhaps another factor was that the admissions team were picky.
1000 people applied last year and 133 were admitted. 2000 have applied
for this academic year and somewhere between 160 and 300 will be
admitted. The fees are high for India, but the admission process is
means-blind, and out of the 133 students in the first year, 88 are on
some level of scholarship.

Undergraduates have to take all 12 of the ‘Foundation courses’
regardless of their major. One of these is called ‘Indian
Civilizations’ which is sometimes taught by me and sometimes by people
in the History department. I’m in the Philosophy department and so am
responsible for the Indian Philosophy courses taken by those majoring in
Philosophy, in PPE, or in an unrelated subject who choose to take an
Indian Philosophy course as an elective. I’m offering six courses in
Indian Philosophy. Neither the number six, nor the titles and content
of these are in any way set in stone yet. I’ll be rolling them out at
the rate of one or two per term for the next two or three years. But
the titles (with course descriptions on the website) that I’ve come up
with so far are:

Introduction to Indian Philosophy  
Buddhist Philosophy  
Vedānta  
Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika  
Indian Philosophy of Religion  
Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Śaivism

As I say, I may decide to divide up the material differently, for
example having more courses centered round issues than darśanas. And I
want to make room for more Mīmāṃsā and Jainism, which look to be too
marginalized by that categorization.

Out of interest, does anyone know of other Philosophy departments where
undergraduates can take as many as six courses in Indian Philosophy?

A great feature of Ashoka is that it is new enough and small enough that
faculty have complete freedom in designing their courses and the paths
that undergraduates in their subject can take. I’ve been reading a lot
recently about the ‘destruction’ (yes I’ve seen that word used!) of the
academic profession in the UK as a result of takeover by management
consultants and business ethos. It feels a long way from that here.  
India is obviously a great place to study and work on Indian
Philosophy. I intermittently find myself pleasantly reminded of how
much expertise in Indian Philosophy exists here. One recent example was
the conference at IIAS, Shimla organized by Arindam Chakrabarti on ‘God,
No-God and the Argumentative Indian.’

One of the things I’d like to do at Ashoka is organize workshops,
seminars and conferences that bring together people working on
Sanskrit/Indian Philosophy in India with those working on it in
universities outside India. It’s easy to forget how much expertise
exists here, because of how rarely the two worlds overlap. To give just
one example, I wonder if there is anyone outside India who can read such
a wide range of Indian philosophical texts in Sanskrit as quickly and
accurately as Mani Dravida?

And Asia, incidentally, affords plenty of opportunity to interact with
people working on Western Philosophy as well. I enjoyed a great
workshop at NYU Abu Dhabi in April organized by Jonardon and Gabe Rabin
at which four members of the NYU Abu Dhabi philosophy department were
joined by people working on Analytic Philosophy and History of Western
Philosophy from Ashoka (Kranti Saran), Manipal (in Karnataka), Turkey
and the Lebanon. I was interested to read Malcolm’s post about Yale-NUS
and I look forward to some tie-ups between them and Ashoka.
