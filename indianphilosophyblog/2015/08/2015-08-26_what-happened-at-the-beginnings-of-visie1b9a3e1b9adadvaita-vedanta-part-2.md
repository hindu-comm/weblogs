What happened at the beginnings of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta?—Part 2

Several distinct component are constitutive of what we now know to be
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta and are not present at the time of Rāmānuja:

1.  1\. The inclusion of the Āḻvār’s theology in Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta
2.  2\. The Pāñcarātra orientation of both subschools of Viśiṣṭādvaita
    Vedānta
3.  3\. The two sub-schools
4.  4\. The Vedāntisation of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta
5.  5\. The impact of other schools

**The two sub-schools**  
The discussion on Pāñcarātra (which you can find in the first part of
this post, [here](http://wp.me/p3YaBu-u9)) suggests a more general
problem regarding the origin of the two “subschools” of Viśiṣṭādvaita
Vedānta. Western scholars initially described them by projecting
retrospectively the split into Vaṭakalai and Teṅkalai to more ancient
times (Lester attributes it already to ”less than 150 years after
Rāmānuja’s death”, 1976, p. 150) and even called the split a ”schism”
(*Kirchentrennung*, Otto 1917, p. 6), thus betraying a tendency to
re-read it through the lenses of the history of Christian theology.
Raman, among others, has shown how the split occurred only much later
(around the 17th c., see Raman 2007). Mumme (1988) suggested that the
two sub-schools have a distinct prehistory, linked to the two centers of
Śrīraṅgam (for the later Teṅkalai) and Kañcī (for the later Vaṭakalai),
both originating from Rāmānuja’s teaching. The hypothesis could be led
further until the consequence that there was never a unity which then
split into two and that the two distinct currents, rather, were brought
together by the converging efforts of some theologians (see this
[post](http://elisafreschi.com/2015/05/29/two-or-three-different-narratives-on-yoga-mima%e1%b9%83sa-visi%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%adadvaita-vedanta-etc/))
and by the fact of sharing a religious background.  
**  
The Vedāntisation of the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta**  
Who is responsible for the Vedāntisation of the school? Rāmānuja is a
clearly Vedāntic author, whereas Yāmuna is not, but was the turn
determined only by the former?

**The impact of other schools  
**  
Rāmānuja is first and foremost a Vedāntic author, but his position
towards Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is much more inclusive than Śaṅkara’s one,
something which could be due to his choice or to Śaṅkara’s peculiar
choice to exclude Pūrva Mīmāṃsā (a question which is difficult to solve,
given that no other early Vedāntic commentary is preserved).  
Apart from Vedānta, the most obvious candidate would be Nyāya, which in
fact did influence Nāthamuni (judging from the title of one of his lost
texts) and certainly Yāmuna’s first adherence to the idea of inferring
God’s existence and his life-long adherence to the idea of inferring the
validity of the Pāñcarātra Sacred Texts from the fact that they have a
reliable author, namely God. The confrontation with Nyāya changed by the
time of Veṅkaṭanātha, who authored a *Purification of Nyāya*
(*Nyāyapariśuddhi*).

**How and why did Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta develop the way it did?**
