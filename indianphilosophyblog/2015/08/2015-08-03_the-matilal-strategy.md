The Matilal Strategy

B. K. Matilal (1935-1991) was undoubtedly one of the most influential
scholars of Indian philosophy in the late 20^(th) century. His work has
greatly influenced many of us who work on Indian philosophy today,
especially if we do so in philosophy departments in the Anglophone
world(see [this
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/07/20/if-you-work-on-indian-philosophy-in-north-america-in-europein-japanin-india/)
from Elisa Freschi on geographical differences in the field). Consider
Matilal’s influence on well-known contemporary scholars such as Jonardon
Ganeri, Arindam Chakrabarti, Mark Siderits, Stephen Phillips, and many
others.

One could easily write about the Mohanty Strategy or the Karl Potter
Strategy. I in no way mean to diminish the contributions of Mohanty,
Potter, and others, but Matilal, who brought his considerable talents
and traditional Nyāya training to positions at the University of Toronto
and Oxford University, probably did more than anyone else to increase
the visibility of Indian philosophy on the philosophical scene of the
Anglophone world.

One of the clearest articulations of the Matilal Strategy can be found
in the introduction of Matilal’s *magnum opus*, *Perception: An Essay on
Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge*.

> “The concern of this book is not purely historical. The writer on
> classical Indian philosophy today is generally pulled in two different
> directions – toward the historical reconstruction of some classical
> views and towards the critical examination of similar modern views. I
> believe those two ‘forces’ are not diametrically opposed; with their
> combined impetus we might make some progress if only diagonally. This
> ‘diagonal’ approach represents a tension which is acknowledged here by
> the author with apologies.” (Matilal 1986, 2)

In his use of this diagonal approach, Matilal makes frequent comparisons
with contemporary analytic philosophy and admits that he has been
“strongly influenced by the analytical tradition of Anglo-American
philosophers” (Matilal 1986, “Acknowledgements”).

As for why *analytic* philosophy should be the tradition to which Indian
philosophy is compared, Matilal says, “Both contemporary analytical
philosophy and the classical Nyāya and Buddhist tradition of India seem
to be interested in the problems of knowledge and perception, the
varieties of meaning and reference, the theory of inference, and the
issue of psychologism” (Matilal 1985, 1). Perhaps we can glean another
answer from his comments on his motivations for engaging in such
comparisons:

> “… this gesture is needed to correct persisting misconceptions, and
> sometimes to remove ignorance. Too often the ‘soft-mindedness’ and
> tender nature of Indian ‘philosophy’ or Oriental wisdom have been
> emphasized. Too often the term ‘Indian philosophy’ is identified with
> a subject that is presented as mystical and non-argumentative, that is
> at best poetic and at worst dogmatic. A corrective to this view is
> long overdue.” (Matilal 1986, 4-5)

More specifically, Matilal meant to call into question what he called
the dogmas of Orientalism, according to which India has a tradition that
is monolith, atavistic, emotional, spiritual, intuitive, irrationalist,
and mystical; such features allegedly contrast with the opposing
features of the West (Matilal 2002, Ch. 25). According to Matilal, the
problem with these myths, aside from the fact that they are false, is
that, “The Oriental man is either subhuman or superhuman, never human. …
there cannot be any *horizontal relationship* between East and West”
(Matilal 2002, 373, italics in original). Matilal’s confidence in the
benefits of cross-cultural interaction and the existence of some
cross-cultural commonalities are also major parts of his pluralist
response to relativism (see Matilal 1991).

To summarize, the Matilal Strategy is a strategy of engaging in
comparisons between the contemporary analytic and classical Indian
philosophical traditions as a means to accomplish the following goals:

1.  To make the study of classical Indian philosophy more visible within
    the discipline of philosophy, and,
2.  To correct harmful misconceptions about classical Indian philosophy
    in particular and South Asia in general.

**What do you think about the Matilal Strategy? Is it still a good way
to increase the visibility of our field and to correct misconceptions?
Do you think there are alternatives that we ought to consider?**
