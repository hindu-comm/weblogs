Ethics in Classical Indian Philosophy

In light of [Stephen Harris’ review of Christopher Framarin’s book,
*Hinduism and Environmental
Ethics*](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/08/08/book-review-of-hinduism-and-environmental-ethics-by-christopher-g-framarin-reviewed-by-stephen-harris/)and
[Elisa Freschi’s discussion of Amod Lele’s article about Śāntideva’s
metaphysical and ethical
though](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/07/28/amod-lele-on-santideva-and-the-impact-of-metaphysics-on-ethics/)t,
I’d like to pose a question.This question has been posed here in the
context of*[political
philosophy](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/category/philosophical-topics/political-philosophy/)*but
not, as far as I can tell, for ethics. The question is, in two parts:

> \(1\) Is there Indian ethical philosophy (normative ethics and/or
> meta-ethics) and (2) which primary texts would you use to introduce it
> to students?

As most readers of this blog will know, the first part of the question
is answered in the negative by B.K. Matilal (among others).
Matilalargues that while Indian texts are concerned with moral issues
in a practical sense, “…morality as such was never discussed in these
texts.” (See his “[Moral Dilemmas: Insights from Indian
Ethics](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199460953.do).”) Now,
plenty of secondary literature like the aforementioned*Hinduism and
Environmental Ethics*has taken up the challenge to elucidate the
ethical arguments more or less implicit in Indian philosophy. However,
what primary texts (in good translation) does one set alongside of the
usual figures–Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill, Foot–in philosophy courses?
Does selecting texts like the*Mahābhārata*and*Bhagavad Gītā*send the
message that Indian philosophy has no systematic ethical reflection? Or
does it put pressure on the notion that ethical philosophy must look a
certain way? And how do you think about“ethics” in classical Indian
philosophy?

Finally, another solicitation for syllabi. If you are teaching a course
which addresses (even in part) ethical inquiry in Indian philosophy and
you’d like to share your syllabus, send it tomdasti (AT) bridgew (DOT)
edu so we can put it on the blog.
