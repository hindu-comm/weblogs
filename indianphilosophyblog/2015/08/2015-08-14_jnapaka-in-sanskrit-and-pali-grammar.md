Jñāpaka in Sanskrit and Pāli Grammar

What does *jñāpaka* mean? Literally it means ‘what causes to know’ and
if you have been working on Sanskrit *śāstra* you will most probably
immediately think of Sanskrit Grammar. Patañjali uses this term in this
sense of “an indirect or implicitly revealing statement” (Freschi and
Pontillo, section 2.7, p. 56) and analyses in this way Pāṇini’s
*Aṣṭādhyāyī*. For instance, Patañjali might say that Pāṇini does not
state X explicitely, but that he explicitly put a *jñāpaka* of X in the
*Aṣṭādhyāyī*, so that one can conclude that X. A fuller definition of
*jñāpaka* can be read in Abhyankar and Jośi’s *Dictionary of Sanskrit
Grammar*s. You can read some further example in Freschi and Pontillo,
sections 3.4.4.4 and 3.4.4.5.

Now, “our” Aleix Ruiz-Falqués recently wrote me about the usage of the
parallel *ñāpaka* in Pāli:

To me, it seems that these texts use the examples of *anvaya*
‘concomitant presence’ and *vyatireka* ‘concomitant absence’ to explain
the meaning of *jñāpaka*. *svabhāvajñāpaka* might be what Dharmakīrti
and his school call *svabhāvahetu* in inference, although I do not know
of uses of the example of heat and fire in this context.

**What do you think? Have you ever encountered *svabhāvajñāpaka*s? And
fire as an instance of it?**
