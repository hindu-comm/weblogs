Soliciting syllabi for courses on Indian philosophy

Recently, Malcolm Keating [brought up the idea for a thread on syllabi
for courses in Indian
philosophy](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/02/20/getting-started-in-indian-philosophy-query-for-readers/).
And [Elisa Freschi’s thread
yesterday](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/07/14/ultimate-reality-in-hinduism-buddhism-etc-some-suggestions-for-a-possible-syllabus/)
reinforced the importance of such a discussion. Here’s what I’d like you
all to do. Please send me PDFs of syllabi that you have for courses on
Indian Philosophy. Feel free to send prototypes for courses you haven’t
yet taught, or links to others’ online syllabi you think worthy of
inclusion. Send to mdasti (AT) bridgew (DOT) edu. I will then create a
new section on the [resources
page](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/resources/) with a list of syllabi
for perusal. If anybody would like to talk shop about basic approaches
to such courses, please do so in the comments section below. I will do a
follow up post once the syllabi have been integrated into the site.
