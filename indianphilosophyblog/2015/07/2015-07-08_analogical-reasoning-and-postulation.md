Analogical reasoning and postulation

Like postulation (*arthāpatti*), the*pramāṇa*orinstrument of
knowledge known as*upamāna,*often translated as “analogy,”**is both
fascinating and underdeveloped in contemporary analysis. There are few
stand-alone books focusing just on*upamāna*, although it is frequently
treated along with testimony and perception. I suspect this is because,
as with postulation,*upamāna*is often reduced to another more
well-accepted*pramāṇa*–usually verbal testimony, inference, or
perception.

Two books devoted only to *upamāna* are:

> Chattopadhyay, Uma.*Dishonoured by Philosophers: Upamana in Indian
> Epistemology*. New Delhi, D.K. Printworld, 2009.

> Kumar, Shiv.*Upamāna in Indian Philosophy*. Delhi: Eastern Book
> Linkers, 1994.

I have been reading just Kumar’s book, since I am waiting for an
inter-library loan of Chattopadhyay to arrive. In doing so, I came
across a debate about the relationship between postulation
and*upamāna*. By the way, I am not translating the latter term since I
am not sure whether “analogy” quite captures what is going on. The
question is whether we can explain*upamāna*as merely an instance of
postulation. The target of this discussion is frequently this famous
stock example (version updated a bit for color):

> Suppose I live in the city of Singapore and while I have seen cows, I
> have little experience with other animals. A rancher tells me that
> the*gavaya*is an animal that’s like the cow. I venture into the
> forests of Malaysia one day and happen upon an animal that looks like
> a cow, but isn’t a cow. I remember what this rancher told me and I
> realize that the animal in front of me is a*gavaya*. (Or I think,
> “That is the animal called ‘*gavaya.*‘)

It’s important to note that*upamāna*is implicated in
language-learning, although that is not its only role for Indian
thinkers. I learn what the denotation of ‘*gavaya*‘ is through
testimony, perception, and memory. While pretty much everyone agrees
that I have knowledge at the end of this stock example, not everyone
thinks that this knowledge is due to some*sui generis*source, like
(most of) the Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā. For instance, the Advaitan Ānandapūrṇa,
in his*Nyāyacandrikā*(who also agrees it is*sui generis*)argues
against an opponent who thinks*upamāna*is just postulation:

> नोपमानं मानान्तरम् अर्थापततितस्तत्सिद्धे: । यद्यनेन सदृशी सा न स्यात्
> ततस्तया सदृशो ऽयं नोपलभ्यत सदृशस्योभयनिष्ठत्वात् । उपलभ्यते चायं तया
> सदृशः ।

> Upamāna is not another means of knowledge because it is established
> that it is postulation. If it were not the case that (the cow) is
> similar (to the*gavaya*), then this similarity would not be
> acquiredsince the similarity is grounded in both (cow and*gavaya*).
> Since this similarity (to the*gavaya*),there is similarity (in the
> cow).

In reply, Ānandapūrṇa says:

> तदसत् असन्निहितसादृश्यधीः स्मृतिरिति प्रतिज्ञाविरोधात् ।

> That is not right, because this contradicts the (opponent’s own)
> assertion: the thought of similarity which is not present is memory.

In other words, the opponent has earlier said that when I encounter
the*gavaya*in the woods, I remember the earlier testimony that
the*gavaya*is similar to the cow. But here the claim is that I know
this similarity through postulation. Only one of these can be correct.
Further, Kumar notes that Ānandapūrṇa argues that since the similarity
which is remembered is not similarity that is currently present to my
senses (when I see the*gavaya*), it is not able to be established. For
most Indian philosophers, the Jaina excluded,*smṛti*or memory is not a
source of knowledge. It is implicated in inference and other*pramāṇa*,
but it is itself not a knowledge-source.

Who might argue that*upamāna*is postulation? We know at least that
Udayana argues for this position in his*Kiraṇāvali.*As a Naiyāyika, he
further thinks that postulation is reducible to inference (*anumāna*) of
a particular sub-variety (it seems that Ānandapūrṇa’s interlocutor does
as well, given what Kumar says about other counter-arguments involving a
discussion of invariable concommitance or*vyāpti*). This view is not
the standard view of Nyāya, however, as many them prefer to hold
that*upamāna*is*sui generis*(Jayantabhaṭṭa is another exception,
arguing againstthe Mīmāṃsā that*upamāna*is a matter of inference).

This discussion is interesting to me, since I find plausible
Mukulabhaṭṭa’s arguments that the cognition of (at least some varieties
of) figurative language are driven by postulation. When one thinks of
figurative language, analogy is central. Poetic thought is about
juxtapositions which point at similarities or contrasts, as well as
explicit statements of these connections, through similes and the like.
Analogical reasoning, too, is important in legal theory, scientific
thought, and so on.

In[Western philosophical
thought](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-analogy/), analogy
is often characterized something like this:

1.  S is similar to T in at least one respect.
2.  S has another feature, P.
3.  Therefore, T has the feature P, or a feature similar to P in some
    respect.

An important question, as in Indian philosophical thought, is how to
analyze the structure of this argument. Unlike Indian philosophical
thought, there is not necessarily a reference to a thinker who is having
a mental episode, moving from testimony to perception to memory of the
testimony and finally to knowledge of the similarity. Further, the
conception of analogy in Western philosophy is inductive: (3) is not a
necessary conclusion drawn from (1) and (2) but is probabilistic (or
some other model). In contrast, for Indian philosophers,
a*pramāna*results in secure knowledge, not belief to a degree or the
like.However, this knowledge need not be secure because it is
inferential. After all, *anumāna*or inference**requires a necessary
pervasion relationship (*vyāpti*) between a sign and what it
establishes. This relationship is difficult to characterize adequately
for*upamāna*. Here is how Jayantabhaṭṭa analyzes it in the
Nyāyamañjarī:

1.  *Sādhya*(what is to be established): the cow remembered is similar
    to the*gavaya.*
2.  *Hetu*(inferential sign): the cowhas the same kind of limbs as
    the*gavaya.*
3.  *Pakṣa*(location relating*sādhya*and*hetu*): the cow remembered
    in the forest.

Here, though, in contrast to the Western characterization, what is being
discovered is the initial similarity between source S and target T. At
least as Jayantabhaṭṭa wants to put it, what comes to be known is that
the cow and the*gavaya*are similar. This poses a problem since it
seems as if this was already known through testimony! Further, if the
paradigmatic example of a*hetu*is smoke which indicates fire’s
presence, (1) we need to have multiple instances of this in order to
make a universal generalization, and (2) for the*hetu*to be valid, we
also need its absence–smoke should not exist where there is not fire.
But in this example, I have only seen one instance of a*gavaya*and
there are other animals with limbs like a cow that are not*gavaya-*s.

There is much more to say about*upamāna*, postulation, inference,
testimony, and their interrelations, as well as the connections between
these topics and analogical thought. However, this should give a sense
of the topic in brief.

Edited for error: “Jayantabhaṭṭa is another exception, *agreeing
with*the Mīmāṃsā that upamāna is a matter of inference” should read
“Jayantabhaṭṭa is another exception, *arguing against* the Mīmāṃsā that
upamāna is a matter of inference.”
