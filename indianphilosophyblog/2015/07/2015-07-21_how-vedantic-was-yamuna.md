How Vedāntic was Yāmuna?

Was Rāmānuja the first author of the Vedāntisation of the current(s)
which later became well-known as Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta? Possibly yes.
But, one might suggest that there are many Upaniṣadic quotations also in
Yāmuna’s *Ātmasiddhi* and that Rāmānuja’s *Śrībhāṣya* seems to speak to
an already well-established audience, and I wonder how could this have
been the case if he were the first one attempting the Vedāntisation…  
Carman (2007, pp. 63–64) suggests a different solution, one in which the
Vedāntisation (my terminology) had already been undertaken by Yāmuna in
the case of Pāñcarātra (which is, instead, rather neglected in
Rāmānuja’s three theological works):

> Yāmuna’s efforts to incorporate Pāñcarātra doctrine into the Vedānta
> involve some recognition of the Bhedābheda view permeating Pāñcarātra.
> In order to avoid Śaṅkara’s criticism of the Bhedābheda, however,
> Yāmuna has to develp his own distinction between *brahman* in the pure
> state and *brahman* as the creative power behind and within the
> universe. For him, this distinction is between God as the possessor of
> qualities and the divine qualities thus possessed, out of which the
> universe evolves. He admits\* that his view can be described as
> “difference and non-difference”. \[…\] Rāmānuja appears to be more
> precise than Yāmuna and more consistent in avoiding expressions that
> sound either like Bhāskara’s Bhedābheda or Śaṅkara’s Advaita. Perhaps
> this was an additional reason for Rāmānuja \[…\] to avoid turning to
> Pāñcarātra texts.

To sum up, according to Carman (1974 and 2007) and Neevel (1977), Yāmuna
already initiated a Vedāntisation. The main differences between his
Vedāntisation and Rāmānuja’s one would be the fact that the former
focused on the Vedāntisation of Pāñcarātra and was closer to
Bhedābheda.  
Rāmānuja, I might further suggest, was *creating* a Vedāntic school much
more than he was vedāntising anything else. Furthermore, he appears to
have been the inventor of the Viśiṣṭādvaita ontology.

\*Unfortunately, Carman does not say where. Since he refers to Neevel
1977 in this paragraph, one might try to look there.
