NDPR Review of Evan Thompson’s Waking, Dreaming, Being

Miri Albahari has a nice review of*Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and
Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy*, by friend
and contributor to the IPB, Evan Thompson.

> This is a ground-breaking philosophical exploration of consciousness
> and the self as they occur across the states of waking, falling
> asleep, dreaming, lucid dreaming, deep dreamless sleep, out-of-body
> experiences and dying. Evan Thompson’s rich, beautifully written book
> interweaves lucid prose with relevant personal anecdotes, bringing the
> latest neuroscience together with ancient contemplative wisdom to
> offer valuable insight into the nature of consciousness and the self.
> The first-person methodologies of Indian and Asian contemplative
> traditions such as Yoga, Vedānta and Buddhism generate data that go
> beyond the reach of the standard scientific approach taken by Western
> neuroscience and psychology, for example on the possible presence of
> consciousness during deep dreamless sleep. At the same time, the
> Western scientific and philosophical approach serves to temper some of
> Indian metaphysical assertions, such as the claim that consciousness
> does not depend upon the brain. Thompson argues convincingly that the
> different approaches — combined to form ‘neurophenomenology’ — produce
> data that reinforce and complement each other, solidifying findings
> that, from just one perspective, would be more speculative (for
> example, that a minimal moment of reportable object-directed awareness
> is 10-20ms). One of main theses to emerge from the study is that the
> self is a fluid process, not a static thing, nor the illusion of a
> thing. Like clouds, the ‘I-making’ enacted self breaks up and re-forms
> with the different states of being, and like a sunlit sky, the
> luminous and pure background consciousness is able reveal the workings
> and contents of both, all the more so if cultivated as a
> meta-awareness through practices of meditation and mindfulness.
