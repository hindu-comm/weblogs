Petition regarding plagiarism

[Rajiv Malhotra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Malhotra), whose
criticisms of scholarship on India will be familiar to many on this
blog, has been accused by [Richard Fox
Young](http://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?id=1960&menu_id=72) of plagiarism
in his recent book [Indra’s
Net](http://www.harpercollins.com/9789351362449/indras-net). Examples of
the problematic passages are [publicly
available](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/3c8quf/confirmed_widespread_plagiarism_found_in_hindu/).
Many of them appear to be drawn, unacknowledged, from the work of
[Andrew Nicholson](https://sbsuny.academia.edu/AndrewNicholson), a
member of this blog. Malhotra has himself issued [public criticism of
plagiarism](https://mobile.twitter.com/rajivmessage/status/530108905989623808)
in the past. There is now a [petition
circulating](https://www.change.org/p/harper-collins-india-in-view-of-the-widespread-plagiarism-found-in-rajiv-malhotra-s-book-indra-s-net-published-by-harper-collins-india-we-call-on-the-publisher-to-make-a-formal-public-apology-and-to-withdraw-the-book-from-the-market?recruiter=5167386&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&utm_term=des-lg-no_src-custom_msg&fb_ref=Default)
to HarperCollins, the book’s publisher, to withdraw the book from
publication on these grounds.
