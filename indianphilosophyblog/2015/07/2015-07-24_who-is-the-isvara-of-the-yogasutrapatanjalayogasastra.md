Who is the Īśvara of the Yogasūtra/Pātañjalayogaśāstra?

Is Īśvara in the *Yogasūtra/Pātañjalayogaśāstra* just the model of a
*puruṣa* who has realised its being separated from nature? Or is He an
omnipotent (and perhaps compassionate) God?  

Some months ago, Andrew Nicholson posted
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/04/25/thinking-with-the-yoga-sutra-translation-interpretation/)
a link to the talks of a conference on the *Yogasūtra* held at the
Loyola University. The talk by Edwin Bryant (a video is available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LepXJuxdRTc&index=17&list=PLGYpcz3VnuwnJ_964HXKKmSyByWtH93uW))
made me for the first time aware of the possibility of interpreting the
Īśvara of the *Yogasūtra* as an omnipotent God. Bryant points in
particular to parallels in the *Bhagavadgītā* and in other religious
texts coeval with the *Yogasūtra*.

Possible questions here:

-   Is the *Yogasūtra* really a text predating the Yogabhāṣya? Or should
    not we rather speak of a unitary
    *[Pātañjalayogaśāstra](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/05/30/two-or-three-different-narratives-on-yoga-mima%e1%b9%83sa-visi%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%adadvaita-vedanta-etc/)*?
    If the latter, do the arguments above still apply?
-   Does it make sense to look for parallels in *religious* texts (I
    know,
    [Amod](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/01/on-body-ritual-among-the-nacirema/)
    has repeatedly shown how slippey this definition may be, let me then
    just say that I am speaking about epics and Purāṇas)?

I am by no means an expert, but until now I have thought of the YS/PYŚ’s
*īśvara* as a *puruṣaviśeṣa* ‘special *puruṣa*‘ and not as a creator
God. In this sense, I have been reading the YS/PYŚ as a *philosophical*
text, to be compared with the Classical Sāṅkhya (rather than with the
less philosophically developed trends of Sāṅkhya which can be detected
in, e.g., the Epics). This harmonises with my general
[observation](https://www.academia.edu/8544445/Systematizing_an_absent_category_discourses_on_nature_in_Pr%C4%81bh%C4%81kara_M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81)
that religious elements tend to be read in a rationalised way in
philosophical texts.  
However, Jonathan
[Dickstein](https://colorado.academia.edu/JonathanDickstein) recently
wrote to me soliciting me to rethink about it. His questions are:
