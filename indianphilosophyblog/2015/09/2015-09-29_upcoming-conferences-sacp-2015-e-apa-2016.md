Upcoming Conferences: SACP 2015, SAGP 2015, E-APA 2016

~~Two~~ three upcoming conferences of interest to our readers. First,
the [Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy(SACP)Annual
Meeting](http://www.sacpweb.org/conferences/sacp-2015/) is this weekend
in Monterey, CA, and there are quite a few sessions pertaining to Indian
philosophy, too many to list here, so I will encourage you to look to
[the posted
schedule](http://www.sacpweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sacp2015-conference-schedule-final.pdf)
for more information. I will be in attendance, as will some other
bloggers, so perhaps there will be some reports posted here in a week.

Second, as Matt Dasti reminds me, the [Society for Ancient Greek
Philosophy has its annual
meeting](http://www.societyancientgreekphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CFP2015.pdf)
along with The Society for the Study of Islamic Philosophy and Science
(SSIPS) at Fordham University, Manhattan on Oct 23-25. He notes, “As
usual, it has a broad offering of panels on ancient philosophy,
including Chinese, Indian and Tibetan.” I have had the chance to attend
in years past and it is indeed an excellent opportunity
tocultivatecross-cultural philosophical reflection. Details of some
panels at the link and in comments below. If you are in the New York
area, try tomake it.

Third, the Eastern American Philosophical Association (APA) has its 2016
[program draft
online](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/Eastern2016/E2016_Meeting_Program_web.pdf)
and theSociety for the Study of Indian and Tibetan Buddhist Philosophy
as well as theAPA Committee on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers
and Philosophies has sessions devoted to Indian philosophy. The SACP has
some sessions as well, which are broader-ranging than Indian philosophy.

Two SACP workshops at the APA which may be of interest, given
conversations here about
[teaching](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/category/pedagogy/), are“How
to Teach Asian Texts in an Ethics Course” chaired by Jeremy Henkel
(Wofford College) and “Practical Steps for Introducing Asian Concepts
into Standard Philosophy Courses” chaired by Douglas Berger (Southern
Illinois University) and jointly organized with the American Association
of Philosophy Teachers (AAPT).

Any other upcoming conferences readers should know about, please post
them in the comments!
