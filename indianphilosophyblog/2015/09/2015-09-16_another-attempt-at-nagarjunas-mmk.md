Another Attempt at Nāgārjuna’s MMK 24:18

I published an essay about five and a half years ago on an alternative
reading of Nāgārjuna’s MMK 24:18 (PEW 60:1) which was first disputed by
Jay Garfield and Jan Westerhoff a year later (PEW 61:1) and then by
Mattia Salvini (JIP 39:3). Though I certainly accept some of Salvini’s
grammatical correctives regarding my original rendering of the verse, I
would like to defend my foregoing interpretation and then suggest a
slightly different reading from my original one here.

In the original essay, I questioned the earlier renderings of MMK 24:18
that appeared prior to 2010, and I will add one below that has appeared
in a major rendition since.

“It is dependent arising that we term emptiness; this is a designation
overlaid (on emptiness); it alone is the middle path.” (Robinson, 1967,
40)

“We declare that whatever is relational origination is śūnyatā. It is a
provisional name (i.e. thought construction for the mutuality of being),
and indeed, it is the middle path.” (Inada, 1970, 148)

We interpret the dependent arising of all things as the absence of being
in them. Absence of being is a guiding, not a cognitive notion,
presupposing the everyday. it is itself the middle way.” (Sprung, 1979,
238)

“We state that, whatever is dependent arising, that is emptiness. That
is dependent upon convention. That itself is the middle path.”
(Kalupahana, 1986, 339)

“Whatever is dependently co-arisen, that is explained to be emptiness.
That, being a dependent designation, is itself the middle way.”
(Garfield, 1995, 304)

“Dependent origination we declare to be emptiness. It (emptiness) is a
dependent concept; just that is the middle path.” (Siderits and Katsura,
2013, 277)

These are closely, though variously interpreted, renderings of the
Sanskrit verse:

*yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ śūnyatāṃ tāṃ pracakṣmahe / sā prajṅaptir
upādyāya pratipat saiva madhamā //*

No difficulty is created by the first line of this stanza, which simply
equates the meaning of *śūnyatā* or “emptiness with that of *pratītya
samutpāda* or “casually conditioned co-arising.” The translators, in
rendering the second line into English, rather straightforwardly take it
to be saying that “emptiness” is further being called a “*prajṅapti
upādāya*,” a standard Buddhist technical term meaning a notion or label
*(prajṅapti*) that is “derived from” or “dependent on” (*upādāya*)
something else. Their understanding follows Candrakīrti’s explication
in *Prasanapadā*, where the exegete harkens back to the *Milindapaṅṅha*
and *Kathāvattu* in pointing out that the label (prajṅapti) “chariot” is
analytically reducible to the parts that make up the chariot, and so
does not denote an independent entity. Candrakīrti is then suggesting
that “emptiness” is, like “chariot,” just a “derived notion” that should
be understood in terms of its constituent parts rather than understood
as a term denoting some discrete metaphysical reality. As I have stated
previously, given the support of this reading in the commentarial
tradition and what seems at first blush to be an uproblematic chain of
reasoning, this is indeed a legitimately possible reading of the verse.
Indeed, it is the dominant interpretation found not only in
contemporary commentators, but also traditional Indian, Chinese and
Tibetan ones. Given the seeming plausibility of the Prasańgika
interpretation and the credentials of those who support it, why even
doubt it? I got in some hot water a few years ago not merely for making
some errors in my original alternative translation that I’m happy to
admit and correct, but even for questioning the Prasańgika reading to
begin with. I’m no sage, I’m just a scholar, so how I dare I? Why
dredge it all up again.

I dredge it all up again because a number of factors continue to make
this reading uncompelling for me. Some of these factors are exegetical
and some philosophical considerations. And they lead me to suggest a I
a possible alternative grammatical construal of MMK 24:18.

First of all, the term*prajńapti*is predominately used in the MMK,
either in nominal or verbal form (*prajńapyate*) is its most generic
senses of “notion” or “label,” as in 9:3, 18:6-7, 19:5 and 23:10-11. On
some occasions, such “notions” or “labels” are certainly false ones, but
they can also legitimately make something known or reveal something to
us. The one set of stanzas where*upādāyaprajṅapti* is invoked in a
technical Abhidharma sense as a“derived notion” is 22:1-11. But here,
it is argued that*tathāgata*, the Buddha after his final liberation
from rebirth, an “empty” being in this state, cannot be understood as
being dependent on the*skandha*s or “personality aggregates.” That is
to say, the empty Buddha should not be understood in terms of “derived
notions” (*upādānena sa kathaṃ prajṅapyate tathāgataḥ*). So, if an
empty Buddha cannot be reduced to the aggregates in the manner in which
other “derived notions” can, then how could Nāgārjuna consistently say
in 24:18 that the notion of “emptiness” itself is just such a “derived
notion?” Furthermore, the cluster of verses surrounding MMK 24:18, such
as verses 16-20, give no indication whatsoever that Abhidharma “derived
notions” are relevant to the discussion at all; they merely emphasize
that all empty phenomena are conditionally co-arisen phenomena. There
seems, within the entirety of the text of the*Kārikā*, to be very
little corroboration of the suggestion that Nāgārjuna considered
“emptiness,” a synonym for “causally conditioned co-arising,” to be a
“derived” notion reducible to its constituent parts, like a “chariot” is
reducible to its wheels and axles or a “person” is reducible to her
pyschophysical aggregates.

And yet, this is precisely Candrakīrti’s reading of the stanza. He
insists that “emptiness,” meaning “causally conditioned co-arising” is a
“derived notion” (*upādāyaprajṅapti*) in the same sense as the idea or
label “chariot” is. The idea and word “chariot” is “derived from the
wheels and the other parts of the chariot” (*cakrādinyupādāya rathāṅgāni
rathaḥ prajńapyate*). But if, like the notion of a “chariot,”
“emptiness” is reducible to “parts,” (*ańgāni*), what would these parts
be? Candrakīrti himself does not say. But we can probably safely
deduce that, if “emptiness” means the same thing as “conditioned
co-arising,” then the “twelve limbs” (*dvādaśāṅga*) of conditioned
co-arising, such as ignorance, craving, volitional habits, clinging,
birth-and-death and so on are the “parts” of emptiness. However, the
early Buddhist philosophers, merely because they identified the “limbs”
or processes of conditioned co-arising, did not classify “conditioned
co-arising” as a mere conceptual construction that did not point to the
way the world really is or that things come to be and cease. On the
contrary, for them, *pratītya samutpāda*was the “right view” of the
causal relations between both natural and mental phenomena–it was not
considered a fiction that needed to be analytically “deconstructed” lest
it mislead us. And yet, Candrakīrti posits that “emptiness” is indeed
merely just such a “derived notion.” The exegesis does bear the stamp
of Prasaṅgika thought. And yet, there is, I believe, something deeply
philosophically odd about this interpretation. After all, Candrakīrti
himself exerts a great deal of effort to show how the MMK dismantles the
Abhidharma ontological scheme to its core. That dismantling cuts
through even the most basic Abhidharma distinctions between
a*dravyasat*or an irreducible “elemental entity” and a
*saṃskṛtasat*or a “compound entity,” the latter of which the Abhidharma
would have us believe are “derived notions” to be analytically reduced
to their fundamental constituents. So why would a text that undermines
the very ontological dichotomy between irreducible and reducible
entities than invoke that very dichotomy to explain the relationship
between “emptiness” and its supposed parts? The reasons Candrakīrti
offers, therefore, for reading MMK 24:18 in this way are for me, on a
philosophical level, quite mysterious, to say the least.

But let us return to other textual considerations. Candrakırti claims
that MMK 24:18 equates the meanings of four “identifying terms”
(*viśeṣasaṃjṅā*), namely “conditioned co-arising,” “emptiness,” “the
middle path” and “derived notion.” That is to say, for Candrakīrti,
“emptiness” means “conditioned co-arising,” and the two together make up
the “middle path” of Buddhist understanding, but all of these terms are
nothing but “derived notions,” reducible to their ingredients. One does
not find a “four-term equation” of this sort in other works attributed
to Nāgārjuna, however. In the “auto-commentary” to
*Vigrahavyāvartani*70, Nāgārjuna proclaims that “conditioned
co-arising,” “emptiness” and “the middle path” are synonymous, but no
mention at all is made of “derived notions.” Likewise
in*Lokatitastava* 22 and*Acintyastava*40, crucial verses that
announce the equivalence in meaning of “conditioned co-arising” and
“emptiness,” “derived notion” is not invoked; the verses merely
underline that “conditioned co-arising” is the “true principle”
(*sadharma*) of the Buddha’s teachings. If we are to believe that a
bedrock of Nāgārjuna’s thought is found in the warning that “emptiness”
is only a “derived notion” to be analyzed away, should we not expect to
find that point emphasized in similar verses in other of his writings
identifying the equivalence of “conditioned co-arising” and “emptiness,”
not to mention in other verses inside the MMK itself?

However, philosophical inconsistencies and textual evidence aside, are
we not forced to grammatically read MMK 24:18 just as Candrakīrti has?
In view of all the foregoing difficulties with the standard Prasaṅga
interpretation, I suggest that there is a grammatical ambiguity in the
crucial second line of the text of MMK 24:18 which makes an alternative
reading possible. That ambiguity lies in the fact that the syntax of
the line may force us to read it as two separate sentences rather than
one compound sentence.

*sā prajńaptir upādāya pratipat saiva madhyamā /*

Were this a single compound sentence to be understood as saying
something like: “this (emptiness) is a derived notion and is itself the
middle path,” we should expect the two instances of “*sā*” in the
sentence to be connected by the conjunctive particle“*ca*.” Instead,
the second “*sa*” is accompanied by the emphatic particle “*eva,*” and
this clearly indicates that the second “*sa*” stands for a different
subject term than the on that begins the line. If then we do have two
separate sentences here, both possessing the often omitted indicative
verb “*asti*,” then we can parse the line like this.

*sā prajṅaptir (asti) / (tāṃ) upādāya pratipat saiva madhyamā (asti) /*

In this version, the line reads: “This (“emptiness”) is the idea
(*prajṅapti*). After apprehending (*upādāya*) that (“emptiness”), this
is truly the middle path to be walked upon.” Here the verse does
nothing more than underscore that “emptiness” means, not “non-existence”
(*abhāva*), but “causally conditioned co-arising,” and this accords with
the Buddha’s teaching and puts one on the “middle path.” This would
make the verse utterly consistent with the immediately surrounding
verses, with the larger framework of what Nāgārjuna asserts about
“emptiness” in the rest of the treatise, and with the stated relation
between “emptiness” and “conditioned co-arising” in other works
attributed to him.

I freely concede that the translation of 24:18 immediately above is
somewhat forced. After all, we could observe the two-sentence
formulation and still translate the second line of the stanza like this:
“*sā prajṅaptir upādāya (asti) / pratipatsaiva madhyamā (asti)*” and we
would still have Candrakīrti’s parsing. The grammatical ambiguity of
the second like of 24:18 hardly decides the interpretive question by
itself. But I believe this fact reinforces my argument rather than
undercutting it. Given all the problems I have found with the standard
Prasańga reading explained above, I think an alternative way to
understand MMK 24:18 is at least justified and plausible. And for me,
it’s a philosophically preferable reading of Nāgārjuna. After all, if
“conditioned co-arising” is a conceptual fiction just as much as, and
just as dangerous as, the fiction of an eternal, fixed “self,” than
recommending Buddhist “derived notions” over those of other traditions
will always lack a vindicating explanation. And if we must, as
Nāgārjuna says in MMK 24:10, rely on conventions to attain our highest
aim, then good grounds for distinguishing between reliable and
unreliable conventions will always be needed. If we eliminate all
grounds for making such distinctions, then “right view” as the first
step on the eightfold path is deprived of its importance, and all the
work Nāgārjuna has put into refuting false theoretical constructions is
rendered unnecessary.
