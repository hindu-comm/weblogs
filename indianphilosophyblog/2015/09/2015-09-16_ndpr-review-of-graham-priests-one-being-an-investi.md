NDPR Review of Graham Priest’s One: Being an Investigation into the Unity of Reality and of its Parts, including the Singular Object which is Nothingness

While Priest’s book is not officially a work on “Indian Philosophy,”
it’s worth noting the way he significantly engages with Buddhist themes
in his latest work.

> Graham Priest is perhaps best known for arguing that contradictions
> can be true and almost as well-known for arguing that some things
> don’t exist. In his newest book, he puts these views to work in the
> service of unapologetic metaphysics in the high old style. The book
> gives us a novel (dialethic) solution to the problem of unity, or the
> puzzle about how many things can come together and manage to be
> a*single thing*despite being many; a theory of that Heideggerian
> object,*nothing*; a structuralist theory of the nature (or
> ‘quiddity’, in Priest’s terms) of objects; and more. It ends drawing
> important socio-ethical conclusions from the metaphysical picture
> developed: the interconnectedness of all things means that the
> suffering of one is detrimental to all, and our own well-being
> requires reducing the suffering of each. The broad range of Priest’s
> metaphysics is matched by the broad range of philosophical traditions
> and sources he draws on, ranging from Plato to Heidegger to Bradley to
> Sartre to Nagarjuna.

Among other things, the reviewer notes that:

> One of the book’s most praiseworthy features is its wide engagement
> with many different traditions and thinkers in those traditions — not
> just those well-respected by mainstream analytic philosophy, such as
> Plato and his friends, but also those analytic philosophy tends to
> ridicule (Heidegger) or ignore altogether (Buddhist thought and
> eastern philosophy more generally). A full third of the book is
> devoted to \`Buddhist themes’, and although I am unfortunately
> unqualified to comment on its exegetical and interpretative quality, I
> can report that I found the discussion fascinating and enlightening.
> Priest gives us clear, precise, technical, and philosophically
> sophisticated theorizing based around these thinkers, giving the lie
> to the not-uncommon trope among analytic philosophers that so-called
> \`continental’ and Eastern thought are inherently wooly, without
> rigor.
