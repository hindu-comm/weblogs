The Moon Points Back: Review at NDPR

Over at NDPR,[Mark Siderits reviews *The Moon Points
Back*](http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/60956-the-moon-points-back/),an edited
volume by the Cowherds (Koji Tanaka, Yasuo Deguchi, Jay Garfield and
Graham Priest).

From the review:

> The papers illustrate the relative maturity and fruitfulness of a
> project that Garfield characterizes as ‘the attempt to address serious
> philosophical problems, of interest in their own right, some arising
> from the Buddhist tradition itself, some from the West, in
> conversation with the Buddhist tradition’ (246).

Siderits focuses on three relative newcomers to the field in
thecritical portion of his essay:Ricki Bliss (Lehigh
University),Amber D. Carpenter (University of York/Yale-NUS College),
and Laura Guerrero (Utah Valley State University), who take up,
respectively, Madhyamaka critiques of causation, Buddhist debates about
persons, and Madhyamaka semantics.
