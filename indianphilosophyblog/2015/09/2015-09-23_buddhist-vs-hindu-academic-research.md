Buddhist vs. “Hindu” academic research

With this post, I’m asking for reflections, speculations, and even bare
conjectures about an apparent asymmetry. As illustrated by some posts
here recently, It seems like there has been something of an explosion of
quality philosophical work on Buddhism and Buddhist traditions in recent
times. While there has been a lot of really good work on the so called
“Hindu” or Vaidika traditions as well it at least appears to lag behind
a bit. So, I’m wondering:

1\. Do you think this appearance tracks reality? Is it true?

2\. If so, what are the reasons or causes for this situation?

Just to make sure: I’m not at all insinuating that if such asymmetry is
there, it must be due to injustice or inherent failing of systems or
individuals. But if it exists, it would be nice to understand why.
