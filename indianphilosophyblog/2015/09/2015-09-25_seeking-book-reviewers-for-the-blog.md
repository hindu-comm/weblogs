Seeking Book Reviewers for the Blog

As the Book Review Editor for the Indian Philosophy Blog I thought it
might be helpful to occasionally make a note of books that may be good
subjects for future reviews. If you’re not sure what our reviews look
like, see some recent
examples[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/09/02/book-review-of-engaging-buddhism-why-it-matters-to-philosophy-by-jay-l-garfield-reviewed-by-mark-siderits/)
and
