Why Daya Krishna?

I just noticed that the
[one](http://elisafreschi.com/2015/04/09/what-is-the-nyaysutra-about/) I
published a few days back here and on my personal blog was my tenth post
on Daya Krishna. Since I usually dedicate that many posts only to
Classical Indian philosophers, this might demand some explanations. Why
engaging with contemporary Indian philosophers? And why Daya Krishna in
particular?

I am generally interested in thinking people, who often happen to be
philosophers, but might as well be
[anthropologists](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/01/31/anthropology-means-critical-scrutiny-an-interview-with-stephan-kloos/ "Anthropology means critical scrutiny—an interview with Stephan Kloos"),
[linguists](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/02/28/it-is-fun-to-reconstruct-the-central-asian-puzzle-an-interview-with-chiara-barbati-part-1/ "It is fun to reconstruct the (Central Asian) puzzle—An interview with Chiara Barbati —Part 1"),
[scientists](http://elisafreschi.com/2014/10/20/a-non-funded-project-on-deontic-logic-and-some-general-notes-on-peer-reviewing-projects/ "A non-funded project on deontic logic —And some general notes on peer-reviewing projects")
and so on, and in this sense I will not start by explaining why on earth
I read philosophical texts. However, I have to admit that I started
reading contemporary Indian philosophers (back in 2002) because I hoped
to better understand classical Indian philosophy through their eyes.
Even before that time, I had read B.K. Matilal’s works or J.N. Mohanty’s
ones (not to speak of J. Ganeri’s ones) not for Matilal’s or Mohanty’s
sake, but as a way of approaching Nyāya, Navya Nyāya or phenomenology.
Reading K.C. Bhattacharya seemed to me like a continuation of that line
of thought (following the steps of great forerunners). However, K.C.
Bhattacharya proved to be too difficult to work as a doorway to
something else and too interesting not to be read for his own sake.

Long story short: I read Daya Krishna (and further contemporary Indian
philosophers) for their own sake, as I would read Kripke or Austin. No
matter what he engages in, he offers an ever-fresh vision of things,
relentlessly looking for what a text or an idea mean and not just for
what one is used to think that they should mean. Daya Krishna’s work
blossoms with openness to the “other” point of view hiding in texts,
ideas or concepts: He is not content with the usual or the conventional
and is clearly annoyed by whoever is. He constantly seeks for a
counter-perspective, and should his ideas have become mainstream in one
or the other field, he would have probably challenged his audience to
question them again, always looking for prairies of thinking which could
have allowed room for creative and yet rigorous enquires.

On top of that, Daya Krishna has for me the additional appeal of being
interested in things I myself find interesting, such as Nyāya’s
epistemology or Mīmāṃsā’s difficult relation with ritualists —something
very rare in other philosophers who, especially in the West, are often
rather pray to the fascination of the “new” and would not spend too much
energy in the exegesis of an obscure school of Indian philosophy. By
contrast, Daya Krishna does not seem to be ready to close a topic unless
he has fully understood what is at stake, no matter if this has become
outdated by new researches in the meantime (think of his invitations to
Kashmir Sufis who were and are for opposite reasons —being too much or
too little “Islamic”— often neglected both in Pakistani and Indian
philosophical and theological discourses).
