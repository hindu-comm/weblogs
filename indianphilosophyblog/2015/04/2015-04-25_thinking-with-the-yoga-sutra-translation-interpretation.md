“Thinking with the Yoga Sūtra: Translation, Interpretation”

Readers may be interested to know that Loyola Marymount University in
Los Angeles recently hosted a conference on Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras. A
video playlist including all of the talks is now available on YouTube.

Among the many fine scholars to present there were Philipp Maas,
Sthaneshwar Timalsina, Yohanan Grinshpon, Ian Whicher, Daniel Raveh,
Edwin Bryant, and Stephen Phillips. At the conference I gave a talk
entitled “Patañjali in the Eyes of His Opponents.” [(Click here to
