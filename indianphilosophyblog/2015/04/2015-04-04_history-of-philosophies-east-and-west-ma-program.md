“History of Philosophies, East and West” MA Program

I am pleased to announce that a new joint Master of Arts Program by the
Asian & Asian American Studies Department and Philosophy Department at
Stony Brook University has just been approved: “History of Philosophies,
East and West.”

To see the program’s brochure, with basic information about themes,
course offerings and teaching faculty, click here:

Please feel free to share this information with your recent graduates
and with others who may be interested. The program has been very
recently approved by the SUNY administration and we are hoping to bring
the first entering class of MA students to Stony Brook in the fall 2015
semester.

Note that the Stony Brook University graduate tuition for New York state
residents is at this time $5,900 for a 12 credit semester load; for
non-residents, it is $10,810.50 for a 12 credit semester load.

I will gladly answer any questions about the program, including giving
more detailed information about applying. You may contact me at
andrew.nicholson@stonybrook.edu.
