What is the Nyāyasūtra about?

I will be not the first one who notes that the list of *padārtha*
‘categories’ at the beginning of the *Nyāyasūtra* is somehow strange.

Let me, therefore, repeat it here (the *padārtha*s have been
emphasised):

> **pramāṇaprameyasaṃśayaprayojanadṛṣṭāntasiddhāntāvayavatarka-nirṇayavādajalpavitaṇḍāhetvābhāsacchalajātinigrahasthānānāṃ**
> tattvajñānān niḥśreyasādhigamaḥ
>
> (the translation is purely indicative:)
>
> The summum bonum is achieved through the knowledge of the reality of
> **means of knowledge, objects of knowledge, doubt, purpose \[of one’s
> investigation\], example, conclusive view, parts \[of the syllogism\],
> reasoning, ascertainment, discussion \[aiming at the establishment of
> truth\], agonistic debate, sophistry, pseudo logical reasons, deceit,
> futile answer and points of defeat**.

A first problem regards the fact that the first two items seem to
already include the rest of the list, so that one does not really
understand why others are separately listed. [My usual
attitude](http://warpweftandway.com/interpreting-philosophy-works/) is
to give credit to a text and try to make sense of it, but in this case,
let us look at it through the eyes of a thought-provoking Indian
philosopher, Daya Krishna, who wrote:

> We have two different types of topics which have been discussed and
> enumerated as *pramāṇa, prameya, saṃśaya, prayojana, dṛṣṭānta,
> siddhānta, avayava, tarka, nirṇaya* on the one hand and *vāda, jalpa,
> vitaṇḍā, hetvābhāsa, chala, jāti* and *nigrahasthāna* on the other.
> The latter obviously relate to discussion and argument between persons
> while the former seem to be more internatl to the nature of the
> argument itself. The latter therefore have psychological elements
> intermixed with other things while the former seem to be more logical
> in character. (2004, p. 61)
>
> The ‘extensional’ enumeration of the subject-matter of the
> Nyāya-sūtras, thus, is an amalgamation of two different discourses,
> the one relating to the forms of argumentation between different
> persons debating a point and winning or losing in the argument, and
> the other relating to the theory of proof of justification. The mixing
> of these different discourses in the first sūtra is a sign of a basic
> confusion in the mind of Gautama, the supposed author of the
> Nyāya-sūtra. (pp. 48–49).

Now, Daya Krishna is a philosopher and his words about the *Nyāyasūtra*
should tell us more about his own philosophical position than about
Nyāya itself. Nonetheless, the point seems to me, in this case, worth
further reflection.
