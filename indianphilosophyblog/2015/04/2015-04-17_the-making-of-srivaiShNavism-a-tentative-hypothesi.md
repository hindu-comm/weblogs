The making of Śrīvaiṣṇavism: A tentative hypothesis about its reconstruction

It is difficult to disentangle the different roots of what is now known
as Śrīvaiṣṇavism, since this term is usually the label attributed to the
religious counterpart of the philosophical-theological school of
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta. However, Vaiṣṇavism was apparently an important
presence in South India well before the beginning of the philosophical
enterprise of what later became its philosophical counterpart, namely
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta.

Accordingly, each study on the making of Śrīvaiṣṇavism needs to take
into account several distinct moments in the development of
Śrīvaiṣṇavism: on the one hand its pre-Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta Tamil
existence and on the other its theological evolution within Sanskrit (or
Sanskritised) philosophy and as Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta. The main
referents for the first phase need to be the Āḻvārs, the poet-saints
whose work has been preserved in the *Divyaprabandham*.

For the second phase, one needs to deal with the formation of a
philosophical school in the work of the predecessors of the first
teachers of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta, namely Nāthamuni and Yāmuna and then
with Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta as found in the work of Rāmānuja, Śrī
Sudarśana Sūri and Veṅkaṭanātha (and other scholars).

The necessary connection of these two phases has been stressed again and
again by the authors of the second phase, who —from a certain moment of
time onwards (possibly from the time of Veṅkaṭanātha)— enumerated the
Āḻvārs among their teachers and forerunners and even tried to connect
their tradition directly with that of the Āḻvārs. Neevel (Neevel 1977,
p. 11) has for instance convincingly argued that the life-spans of the
most important authors of the philosophical formation of a Viśiṣṭādvaita
school have been prolonged in order to connect them to each other and to
link the first of them, Nāthamuni, to the Āḻvārs, although this led to
the attribution of a lifespan of 330 to 340 years to him.

To sum up, Śrīvaiṣṇavism became what is known to us as Śrīvaiṣṇavism
through the heritage of the **Āḻvārs**, the ritual contribution of the
**Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās** and the **philosophical contribution of
Nāthamuni and Yāmuna** first and of the **Vedāntic reshaping by
Rāmānuja** thereafter. **Veṅkaṭanātha** might have been the attraction
pole completing the puzzle of all these loose elements.
