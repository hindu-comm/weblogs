Soliciting reviews for Philosophy East and West

Friends, following the practice of Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, I try to
make a point to personally contact qualified reviewers for work on
Indian philosophy for *Philosophy East and West*, while avoiding open
calls for reviews. That said, I am in possession of some books that are
indeed worthy of review but for whatever reason, I’ve had bad luck
finding reviewers. I am worried that they will just languish on my
office shelf until they become part of the scenery. I will list some of
them below. If you are interested in writing a review, please contact me
at <mdasti@bridgew.edu>.

Eviatar Shulman, *Rethinking the Buddha: Early Buddhist Philosophy as
Meditative Perception* (Cambridge University Press 2014)

Leah Kalmanson and James Mark Shields, *Buddhist Responses to
Globalization* (Lexington Books 2014)

B. Alan Wallace, *Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science,Buddhism,
and Christianity* (Columbia Series in Science and Religion 2009)

If I don’t know you personally, please include a CV and academic
credentials or a link to your academic web page. Thank you.
