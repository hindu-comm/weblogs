Deontic rules at work: A case of conflict

Let us take the abstract form of a Vedic prescription:

> (A.) Whoever desires to achieve something should sacrifice

It is easy for an objector to go on and argue as follows:

> A Śūdra (i.e., a member of the lowest class) desires to achieve
> something  
> A Śūdra should sacrifice (PMS 6.1.25)

Mīmāṃsā authors, however, reply:

> No, because sacrifice presupposes knowledge of the Vedic prescriptions
> enjoining it, such as (A.), and a Śūdra is not entitled to hear the
> Veda. In fact, there is the following prohibition:
>
> > (B.) A Śūdra should not engage with the Veda (*Śābarabhāṣya* ad PMS
> > 6.1.37)
>
> Now, why is the prohibition (B.) stronger than the prescription (A.)?
> I can think of two or three possibilities:
>
> 1.  Because (B.) is more specific than (A.). That specific rules
>     overrule more generic ones is known as the *upasaṃhāranyāya*.
> 2.  Because prohibitions have a bigger deontic value than
>     prescriptions.
> 3.  (Because of sociological reasons: Śūdra could not be allowed to
>     sacrifice because there was a social consensus about the fact that
>     they were not allowed to perform sacrifices)
>
> The last explanation is easy, but I am afraid it might be too easy.

> are entitled to sacrifice. No. 1 is fine and probably applies here,
> although one needs to be aware that multiple rules may act
> simultaneously, so that, e.g., in the case of the Śyena sacrifice the
> same rule is not enough to overrule the generic prohibition to perform
> violence in case of the malefic sacrifice Śyena.
