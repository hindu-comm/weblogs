“Is there Philosophy in India?” and what this question tells us, an essay by Ankur Barua

After many years, I am sort of fed up with having to answer the question
above, and this is also why I had not read the essay by Barua (bearing
the title *Is there ‘Philosophy’ in India? An Exercise in
Meta-Philosophy* and available
[here](https://www.academia.edu/9183609/Is_there_Philosophy_in_India))
until he recommended it to me. In fact, the article tells more about
what it means to ask the question, than about the answer (which is a
straightforward “yes”).

First, the question bears on the distinction between faith and reason
and theology and philosophy (and the consequent dismissal of Indian
philosophy as a quest for liberation, mystical etc.):

> \[There is an\] often-heard criticism that classical Indian thought
> cannot be characterised as an intellctually acceptable branch of
> ‘academic philosophy’ becayse it is entangled with ‘religion’ (p. 14).

And already on the first page, Barua speaks of the parallel condemnation
of the medieval Scholasticism and of thinkers like Thomas Aquinas:

> The Schoolmen are not ‘philosophers’ because they are Churchmen whose
> point of departure is a specific Christian world-view, and hence thier
> learned treatises are to be cognised, as David Hume famously put it,
> to the withering flames of logical analysis.

Thus,

> Anglophone philosophy’s rejection of its internal other, medieval
> Scholasticism, is paralleled by its suspicion of its external other,
> Indian *darśana* —both are supposed to be fatally implicated in
> Metaphysics, Authority and Tradition (pp. 14–15).

This conclusion supports the more general point that “philosophy is not
a natural kind” (p. 6) and that, thus,

> Any definition is controversial and already embodies a philosophic
> attitude (Russell 1975:7, quoted at p. 7).

In this sense, the question at the title of this post opens an exercise
in meta-philosophy (“What do we expect ‘philosophy’ to mean?”). As for
the possiblity of detecting “philosophy” in India,

> as it often happens with the translation of terms which are richly
> woven into one specific cultural universe into those of another
> cultural universe, we may argue that terms such as *darśana* and
> *ānvīkṣikī* are ‘not the same, and yet not another’ from *philosophia*
> (p. 27).

But this by no means means that one should refrain from using the word
“philosophy” while speaking of Indian schools and discussions. On the
one hand, as shown by Barua, the soteriological commitment of several
Indian schools does not mean that they did not engage in philosophical
arguments about the issues deriving from such a commitment (e.g., the
nature of reality and of the self). On the other (at last, in the
present writer opinion),

> As for western philosophers themselves, in the wake of Kuhn and other
> thinkers who have developed various froms of social epistemology, they
> have become less shy of speaking of authoritative testimony (pp.
> 27–28).

As for the sociality of the scientific enterprise,
[this](https://www.academia.edu/10710644/Whom_Do_We_Trust_Authority_Authenticity_and_the_History_of_Science)
article focusing on the Western scenario by Dominik Wujastyk is also
worth mentioning, together with a
[post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/10/12/sabda-and-the-sciences/)
by our Amod Lele.

Beside the above, Barua’s essay also deals with several instances of
debates both in India and in the West. Barua refers to J. Ganeri’s point
that we have to “rescu\[e\] a story suppressed by Orientalism — the
story of reason in a land too often defined as reason’s Other” (Ganeri
2001: 4, quoted at p. 26). Nonetheless, whereas Ganeri and Matilal dealt
with the accusation that Indian thought is just mysticism by showing its
rigour, Barua recurs to Hadot and shows that also in the West philosophy
does not need to be disinterested and pure theoresis. Section “C” is in
fact a long discussion of Augustine’s conception of time and of how his
philosophical reflections are not “an exercise in idle speculation but
are closely related to his exegetical struggles with the Biblical text”
(p. 12).

A further, personal comment: Some time ago, a friend has been
interviewed for a leader position in an institute for Asian thought. She
said she would like the institute to have a “philosophical focus” and
one of the people in the committee (who does not work on philosophy)
rebutted that using the word “philosophy” could be suspected of a
“colonialist attitude”, since “philosophy” is a Western concept. I am
sure this objection was well-meant, but I am suspicious of its
consequences, namely the implicit statement that only Westerners are
able to think philosophically. **While thinking we are fair and
diversity-aware, we are in fact delegitimizing centuries of
philosophical elaborations by refusing to call them “philosophy” just
because they happened to take place East of Suez.**

CAVEAT LECTOR: These are only *my* personal reflections on this topic
and my reading of Barua’s article. Don’t read in the article [anything
but](http://elisafreschi.com/about-this-blog/) what is explicitly said
in it.
