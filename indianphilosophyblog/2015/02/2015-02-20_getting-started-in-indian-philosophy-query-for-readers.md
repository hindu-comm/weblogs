Getting Started in Indian Philosophy: Query for Readers

This is somewhat related to Matt Dasti’s last [call-for-papers
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/02/19/call-for-papers-and-panel-proposals-including-for-a-special-workshop-on-how-to-incorporate-asian-texts-into-traditional-philosophy-courses/),
but more geared towards philosophy colleagues, not philosophy courses.
If you’re like me, you occasionally have peers saying that they’re
interested in Indian philosophy but overwhelmed, and don’t know where to
start. What advice do you give them? I’m curious what people recommend
as entryways into Indian philosophies, and why. Do you suggest they
start with a primary text in translation? With a secondary text that’s a
historical overview? With a favorite syllabus you’ve come across online
or developed yourself?
