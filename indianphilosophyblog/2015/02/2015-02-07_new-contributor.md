New Contributor

We have a new contributor in the IPhB! Malcolm
[Keating](http://malcolmkeating.com) just completed his PhD at the
philosophy department of the University of Texas, Austin. His thesis is
entitled *Speaking Indirectly: Non-Literal Meaning in Indian Philosophy*
and deals with lakṣaṇā from the perspective of Indian philosophy of
language, but also with a wider philosophical perspective.  
As for his on-line presence, Malcolm has a
[blog](http://malcolmkeating.blogspot.co.at/), is the promoter of the
[Virtual
Sanskrit](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/01/06/virtual-sanskrit-reading-group/ "Virtual Sanskrit reading group")
Reading Group and has already contributed a guest post to this blog,

We can thus look forward for many interesting posts!
