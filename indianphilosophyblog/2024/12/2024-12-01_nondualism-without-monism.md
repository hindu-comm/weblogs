Job Ad: Associate or Full Professor in Classical Indian Philosophy at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa

Monism is the idea that everything is, or is ultimately reducible to, one. This is not quite the same as *nondualism*, a term increasingly common in mystical circles. Nondualism is the idea that everything is not two or more – not *more* than one. Nondualism and monism are very similar concepts, but they’re not *exactly* the same.

I’m speaking here of each term’s deepest metaphysical meaning, where it refers to the ultimate nature of the universe (each term can be used in other ways as well). The general core idea of nondualism is [quite widespread](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/08/perennial-nondualism/): that is, that the most ultimate reality should not be identified with the many plural distinct things we typically observe and the distinctions between them. The ultimate is not dual or plural, and especially, at the ultimate level there is no distinction between subject and object. Yet all of that still doesn’t *necessarily* mean that the ultimate is *one.*

The English word *nondual* (and thus nondual*ism*) is a translation of the Sanskrit *advaita*, “not two”. The English word *monism* began as the German coinage of [Christian Wolff](https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy/philosophy-terms-and-concepts/monism#4), from the Greek word *monos* (“single”, which gives us all of our various mono- prefixes, like monotheism and monopoly). What Wolff had in mind applies to many Sanskrit versions of *advaita*, but not all of them.

The most famous Indian schools of philosophical nondualism are indeed monist. They are in the [Vedānta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta) tradition of the [Upaniṣads](https://iep.utm.edu/upanisad/), those ancient texts that proclaim *ekam evādvitīyaṃ brahma*: the ultimate is just one, without a second. That can [mean different things](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2023/05/experiencing-different-ultimate-unities/): [Śaṅkara](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/), the leader of the Advaita – literally nondual – school, proclaimed that that ultimate one is the only thing real, and all the difference we perceive is mere illusion (*māyā*). His opponent Rāmānuja, who led the Viśiṣṭādvaita (“differentiated nondual”) school, said that the differences we perceive are indeed real; they are *part* of that one ultimate reality. Nevertheless, the two nondualists agreed on that basic claim of the Upaniṣads: everything is *one*.

But not every nondualist did.

If things are not two (or more), that doesn’t mean that they are one. They could instead be *zero*. And that is what [Madhyamaka Buddhism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/madhyamaka/) insists: the ultimate reality of things, to the extent that it can be spoken of in words at all, is best characterized as *śūnyatā*. *Śūnyatā* is usually translated “emptiness”, but that’s not an entirely ideal translation, because “emptiness” has the obvious opposite of “*fullness*“, and *śūnyatā* by its nature [must have no opposite](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/03/no-opposite-for-the-ultimate/). But when Indians first invented the mathematical concept of zero, the Sanskrit word they used was… *śūnya*. In most modern Indian languages, the word for zero remains *śūnyā*. Śūnyatā, then, is literally *zero*-ness – and that is a more precise translation, because zero, mathematically, indeed has no opposite.

Like Śaṅkara, Madhyamaka Buddhists believe that the differentiated world we see around us is ultimately illusion. Śaṅkara got the idea from them, and for that reason Rāmānuja pejoratively called him a *pracchanna bauddha* – a crypto-Buddhist. For both Śaṅkara and the Mādhyamikas, concepts themselves are part of the illusion and therefore words do not do justice to what lies behind it: what’s underneath is something ineffable, perhaps most effectively characterized by what it’s *not*. The Upaniṣads characterize it as *neti, neti*: “‘not’, ‘not'”. The Buddha in the Śūraṅgama Sūtra says of the words we use to describe: “This is like a man pointing a finger at the moon to show it to others who should follow the direction of the finger to look at the moon. If they look at the finger and mistake it for the moon, they lose (sight of) both the moon and the finger.”

But point the way toward the moon we must, if anyone is actually going to be able to follow the direction. So which way is the moon? In what direction is the finger pointing? That is where Śaṅkara and the Mādhyamikas differ from each other. For him, the ultimate behind the illusion is best described as one; for them, it is best described as zero.

[Meister Eckhart](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/11/it-is-gods-will-that-i-should-have-sinned/), for his part, seems to straddle the difference. As I understand him, at some level all things are God, and he describes God as [fundamentally one](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/01/mystics-marx-and-negating-the-negation/); yet he *also* describes God as a “pure nothingness”, *ein bloß nicht*. [Negating the negation](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/01/mystics-marx-and-negating-the-negation/) may be his complex attempt to have it both ways.

What difference does that difference make? In the Indian context, quite a lot. Śaṅkara is trying to establish the truth of the Upaniṣads, and those texts say that everything is one. The Mādhyamikas are arguing for the [Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajnaparamita), which claim that everything is zero. Those sacred texts in turn contain a lot of other things besides: the Upaniṣads, for example, affirm an existing social order with the hierarchy of caste, while Buddhist sūtras urge leaving that order to join a non-caste-based order of monks.

But we now are not bound by that context. I have enough [Buddhist faith](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/06/why-i-am-a-buddhist/) that I am much more predisposed to the Madhyamaka view myself. But faith or not, what, if anything, does the difference between ultimate oneness or zero-ness mean philosophically? The answers to that are complicated enough that I don’t feel I’ve yet fully worked them out myself. Here, I’m just pointing to the difference itself, as a start.
