The scientific self is not reductionist

How can we reconcile [Buddhism with expressive individualism](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/02/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/) (“be yourself”) and with natural science? When I had [previously turned to Wilfrid Sellars](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/06/a-sellarsian-solution-for-the-self/) for help on this question, I had compared Sellars’s view to *two* Buddhist metaphysical positions on ultimate truth, which are quite different from each other. One of these was Buddhaghosa’s view that ultimate truth is reductionist, and I [no longer find that comparison helpful](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/12/the-scientific-self-is-not-reductionist). But I *also* turned to Śāntideva’s view that the ultimate is normatively inert, with no good or bad involved. Śāntideva’s view rejects Buddhaghosa’s in some very important ways – and I think that philosophically his metaphysics is considerably more powerful.

That’s a big deal for me because, having [come to my Buddhism in Thailand](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/07/my-story-finding-buddhism/), I have generally viewed myself as a [Theravādin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) like Buddhaghosa. I’ve been skeptical of the most famous piece of Śāntideva’s metaphysics, his [ethical deconstruction of self and other](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2011/03/of-anatman-and-altruism/) in chapter VIII of the Bodhicaryāvatāra. I’m not convinced by his or [any other argument](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/01/of-drowning-children-near-and-far-ii/) for a universal impartial altruism – a key Mahāyāna doctrine. Yet I *do* now find myself moving closer to a Mahāyāna or at least [Madhyamaka](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/madhyamaka/) view, because of a different aspect of Śāntideva’s metaphysics: the metaphysics of emptiness in chapter IX, which I think are considerably deeper.

In that chapter, like Buddhaghosa or a modern physicist, Śāntideva breaks reality up into the smallest possible parts, called *aṇu*s in Sanskrit. Most people translate *aṇu* as “atom”, based on the literal meaning of “atom” (Greek *a-tomos*, indivisible) – but the irony of modern physics is that what we today call “atoms” *are* divisible. For that reason I translate *aṇu* as “quark”, since quarks are (as far as I know) the smallest part we recognize in our modern cosmology. But it’s the *next* step Śāntideva takes, after dividing things into quarks, that gets really interesting. He claims that “that quark too can be divided into directional parts” (IX.86) – that is, you can still approach a quark from the left or the right, the bottom or the top, which means it must have *sides*, and those effectively constitute further parts. But then, he says: “The directional parts, because they have no component parts, are just empty space. Therefore the quark does not exist” (IX.87). If you take the next step *after* reductionism, you get to *śūnyatā*, [emptiness or zero-ness](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/12/nondualism-without-monism/).

This is all important to Śāntideva because we get *attached* to things, and seeing things’ ultimate emptiness helps break that attachment:

> When all things are empty in this way, what can be received, what
> taken away? Who can be honoured or humiliated by whom? From what can
> there be happiness and misery, what can be liked and what loathed?
> What craving can there be? For what is that craving, when examined as
> to its true nature? (BCA IX.151-2)

Now [Buddhaghosa’s reductionist view](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/12/the-scientific-self-is-not-reductionist) had previously drawn me because I had seen it, a little clumsily, as close to natural science. But if anything Śāntideva’s view is at least as close. Sellars’s idea of the scientific image draws heavily on physicist Arthur Eddington’s idea of [“two tables”](https://wiki.c2.com/?EddingtonsTwoTables), from Eddington’s *The Nature of the Physical World*: the table he is writing on is at once a commonsense and familiar object that appears before our eyes (“It has extension; it is comparatively permanent; it is coloured; above all it is substantial”) *and* a “scientific table”. The latter is not a part of “that world which spontaneously appears around me when I open my eyes”, but rather “part of a world which in more devious ways has forced itself on my attention”, one which makes for a more satisfying explanation in a wider range of circumstances. But here is Eddington’s own description of the scientific table:

> My scientific table is mostly emptiness. Sparsely scattered in that
> emptiness are numerous electric charges rushing about with great
> speed; but their combined bulk amounts to less than a billionth of the
> bulk of the table itself.

Mostly *emptiness!* Exactly that English word most commonly used to translate the Buddhist Sanskrit *śūnyatā* (even if that’s [not the *ideal* translation](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/12/nondualism-without-monism/)). On this great physicist’s account, what distinguishes the scientific table from the manifest, observable one is not merely that the table is made of atoms, but also that the table is *mostly empty space.* In a purely physical sense, we are all *mostly empty* – though of course the “mostly” does a lot of work!

Physically, it would seem, everything is mostly empty space. Mentally, consciousness – mind – [had a beginning](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/10/the-world-before-and-after-us/) and it will [have an end](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2024/08/eventual-human-extinction-and-why-it-matters/). There’s a reason people ask the question “why is there something *rather than nothing?*” Nothing is the natural baseline. It turns out that even something mostly *is* nothing. The question is why this *qualified* nothing arose – why we are, why everything is, *mostly nothing rather than all nothing*, [as *The Princess Bride* might put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbE8E1ez97M). Everything we care about is in that “mostly nothing”, that fragile substratum like sea foam. In that way we are like dust in the wind. And yathābhūtadassana as I understand it requires acknowledging this, embracing it.

That is not to repeat the mistake of homogenizing the two: on Śāntideva’s view the ultimate reality is *ineffable*. For him it is not that the truer reality is *mostly* empty space, but it is in some sense *all* empty space, which is not what Eddington’s physics implies. Still, it is very significant that if we *keep going* from *either* of the reductions I proposed in the past – the natural-scientific reduction *or* the Buddhist abhidhammic reduction – we get a further reduction that lands us in *some* form of emptiness. And so, I think, if we are trying to harmonize Buddhism and natural science, we likely do it better with emptiness than with atomistic reductionism.
