The Philosophical Rasika Report: Listings of Ph.D. Programs in Indian Philosophy (2024 Edition; Part II: Europe)

We are extremely sad to report that [Anand Jayprakash Vaidya](https://anandvaidya.weebly.com) passed away on Oct. 11, 2024. He was Professor of Philosophy at San Jose State University, champion for integrating Indian philosophy into the larger discipline, and a contributor to this blog.

You can find [more details about him in this obituary on Daily Nous](https://dailynous.com/2024/10/12/anand-vaidya-2024/) and on [his website.](https://anandvaidya.weebly.com)

We decided the best way to honor Anand on the Indian Philosophy Blog would be to create a post here where his many friends, colleagues, and collaborators could share their memories and thoughts about Anandâ€™s life, work, and legacy.

Please feel free to leave a comment on this post if you would like to share anything about Anand, whether you were a friend, colleague, or simply an admirer of his work.
