Finding mysticism in unexpected places

*This guest post is by Satyan Sharma (PhD, Panjab University, Chandigarh).*

In his chapter titled ‘Habit and Karmic result in Yogaśāstra’, published in the *Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy*, Christopher G. Framarin has many a time stated that *Yogaśāstra* does not explicitly state that actions lead to habits. For example, he states:

It is worth noting, however, that the *Yogaśāstra* never explicitly says that the relationship between actions and habits parallels the relationship between mental states and habits. – Framarin (2017, p. 136)

Based on Philipp A. Maas’ work, Framarin takes both the *sūtras* and the commentary (attributed to Vyāsa) to be composed by a single author, and for this reason the entire text including the commentary, is referred to by him as the *Yogaśāstra* (Framarin, 2017, p. 133).[^(\[1\])](#_ftn1) Hence, in this response, I have used the term *Yogaśāstra* in the same sense. He has taken the term ‘*saṃskāra*‘ to mean habit. If we take ‘*saṃskāra*‘ to be habit, then it seems that *Yogaśāstra* does state that actions lead to habits.

*Karma* or action is said to produce *karmāśaya* or action deposit. As per the commentary on *sūtra* 1.24, *āśaya* means *vāsanā* which is in accordance with the fruits of actions.[^(\[2\])](#_ftn2) Similarly, on *sūtra* 4.6, *āśaya* has been defined as the tendency of desire, aversion, et cetera.[^(\[3\])](#_ftn3) In this way, the term *karmāśaya* means *karmavāsanā*, and it is to be noted that the commentator has himself used the latter term in the sense of the former term in the commentary on *sūtra* 4.9.[^(\[4\])](#_ftn4)

In the commentary on *sūtra* 2.15, it has been stated that *karmāśaya* is of the form of merit (*dharma*) and demerit (*adharma*).[^(\[5\])](#_ftn5) In the commentary on *sūtra* 3.18, it has been said that habits (*saṃskāras*) are of two kinds; first, those which cause memory and affliction (*kleśa*), and second, those which cause fruits of actions and are of the form of merit and demerit.[^(\[6\])](#_ftn6) *Vāsanā* is also a form of *saṃskāra*, and so is that which causes fruits of actions. What leads to or causes the fruits of actions? In the commentary of *sūtra* 2.13, it has been said that if afflictions remain, the *karmāśaya* becomes the cause of fruits of actions.[^(\[7\])](#_ftn7) So if *karma* leads to *karmāśaya*, and if *karmāśaya* is a kind of *saṃskāra*, *saṃskāra* being habit as per Framarin’s translation, it could imply that actions lead to habits as per *Yogaśāstra*.
