Guest post: A response to Christopher G. Framarin’s “Habit and Karmic result in Yogaśāstra”, by Dr. Satyan Sharma

My thanks to Dr. Satyan Sharma for carefully considering my paper and for reaching out to discuss the analysis of *saṃskāras*, *vāsanās*, and *karmāśayas* in the *Yogaśāstra* (YŚ).[\[1\]](#_ftn1) I find this discussion especially important, because it challenges the widespread assumption that the theory of karma in Hindu (and Buddhist) traditions can be analyzed in terms of moral character, action habits, dispositions, and so on. The influence of this contemporary account of karma can hardly be overstated. And yet, I count it as a dogma badly in need of revaluation – and rejection.

Dr. Sharma’s comments are a welcome contribution to this project. They have led me to see other possible implications of the text, and better appreciate the textual evidence for the competing view. I remain very skeptical about the plausibility of the standard reading, but I’ve come to accept that the most convincing objections against it are philosophical rather than exegetical. (While Sharma’s comments were just posted Saturday, I received them earlier and spent about a week writing my response.)

The claim from my [original paper](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/27982/chapter-abstract/211661495?redirectedFrom=fulltext) that Dr. Sharma disputes is my claim that the *Yogaśāstra* does not state that actions produce *saṃskāras*. I make this claim, however, in the context of reviewing the analysis of *saṃskāras* at YŚ 1.5. This passage states that *saṃskāras* arise from *vṛtti* – mental states – and dispose the agent to similar *vṛtti* in the future. A desire for chocolate ice cream, for example, might produce (or strengthen) the disposition to desire chocolate ice cream in the future. This disposition to desire chocolate ice cream would be a *saṃskāra*.

mental state ⇒ *saṃskāra* ⇒ mental state

Contemporary scholars tend to assume that something similar happens with action. I cite a number of authors who assert this view in the original paper (134-135). *Saṃskāras* arise from actions and dispose the agent to repeat similar actions in the future. A person tells a lie, for example, and becomes disposed to lie in the future. Another diagram:

action ⇒ *saṃskāra* ⇒ action

The standard contemporary view says that a cycle of bad behavior explains the “bad karma” that the agent eventually suffers – karmic “fruits” like loss of friendships, loneliness, and so on. A parallel cycle of good behavior, in contrast, might explain the good karma that the agent finally enjoys. The person who tells the truth becomes habituated to do so. They are eventually rewarded for their honesty, by winning the trust of others, being promoted, and so on:

\(3\)

action ⇒ *saṃskāra* ⇒ action ⇒ karmic result

My central thesis in the paper is that YŚ does not assert (3). More specifically, YŚ does not explain the production of karmic results in terms of habits of action.

Initially, I note that YŚ does not explicitly state that actions produce *saṃskāras* (136). I allow, however, that proponents of (2) might analyze the notion of *karmāśayas* in YŚ as dispositions (*āśayas*) to action (*karma*). The argument that I outline cites YŚ 2.13, which counts *vāsanās* as a type of *saṃskāra* and equates *karmāśayas* with *vāsanās* (138). If *vāsanās* are *saṃskāras*, and *karmāśayas* are *vāsanās*, then presumably *karmāśayas* are *saṃskāras*! For the rest of the paper, I reason under the assumption that *karmāśayas* are indeed *saṃskāras*, and hence, that actions do indeed produce *saṃskāras* (in the form of *karmāśayas*).

Sharma argues that YŚ claims that actions produce *saṃskāras*. Much of Sharma’s argument parallels my own preliminary argument for analyzing *karmāśayas* in terms of *saṃskāras*. Sharma’s analysis, however, is more comprehensive. In addition to reviewing YŚ 2.13-15, Sharma cites a number of passages that I had not considered. I review those citations here with some elaboration. (For someone who has just read Sharma’s post, feel free to skip the next four paragraphs!)

First, Sharma takes the first lines of the commentary to YŚ 1.24 to equate *vāsanās* with *āśayas*. He translates this as “*āśaya* means *vāsanā* which is in accordance \[*anuguṇā*\] with the fruits of action.”[\[2\]](#_ftn2) This suggests that *karmāśayas* are *karmavāsanās*. Sharma also notes that YŚ 4.9 uses the term *karmavāsanās* explicitly. Again, this claim, when combined with the claim that *vāsanās* are essentially the same as *saṃskāras* (YŚ 2.13), entails that *karmāśayas* are a type of *saṃskāra*.

Sharma takes a related quotation at 4.6 to define *āśaya* as “the tendency of desire, aversion, et cetera.”[\[3\]](#_ftn3) This might imply that *karmāśaya*, too, is a disposition to produce desire, aversion, etc. Alternatively, it might imply that *karmāśaya* is the tendency or disposition to act rather than desire, and so on.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

The commentary to YŚ 3.18, in turn, begins: “habits \[*saṃskāras*\] are of two kinds: first, those which cause memory and affliction (*kleśa*), and second, those which cause fruits of actions and are the form of merit and demerit” (Sharma translation). I point out in my original paper that YŚ repeatedly analyzes *karmāśayas* as merit and demerit (139, YŚ 2.12-13, 2.15). If *karmāśayas* are merit and demerit, and if the second type of *saṃskāras* “are the form of merit and demerit,” then presumably *karmāśayas* are a type of *saṃskāra* after all – they are just this second type of *saṃskāra*. 

All of this suggests that actions might produce *saṃskāras* after all. This seems to be the sense of the last lines of Sharma’s piece. Sharma says, “\[s\]o if *karma* leads to *karmāśaya*, and if *karmāśaya* is a kind of *saṃskāra*, *saṃskāra* being habit as per \[Framarin’s\] translation, it could imply that actions lead to habits as per *Yogaśāstra*.”

At first, I was not sure that Sharma and I disagreed. As I mentioned, my paper grants the point that actions might be taken to produce *saṃskāras* in the form of *karmāśayas*. So Sharma’s citations might be taken to simply bolster the assumption under which I argue throughout the paper. Sharma says, “actions produce *saṃskāras*,” and I might respond, “sure, let’s assume they do.” Indeed, I’m more confident that actions produce *saṃskāras* now, having read Sharma’s piece, than I was before. In light of this, I see little reason to doubt the first part of (3) above:

(3a)

action ⇒ *saṃskāra*

At the same time, I argue in the second half of my paper that a plausible explanation of how agents become conditioned to repeat actions does not require *saṃskāras*/*karmāśayas* that result directly from actions. Instead, the desires that motivate action produce *saṃskāras* that dispose the agent to *desire*, and these subsequent desires motivate repeated action. I won’t take the time to summarize the details of those arguments here. They are in [the original paper](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/27982/chapter-abstract/211661495?redirectedFrom=fulltext). But the outcome is this (with the second desire leading back to a repetition of action):

\(3\)

action ⇒ directresult ⇒ desire(for result) ⇒ *saṃskāra* ⇒desire (for result)

 ⇐====================================

On this account, the repetition of action is a result of the *saṃskāras* that dispose an agent to desire the results of past actions. They are not a result of any *saṃskāra* that disposes an agent to act directly – although the desires that arise from the *saṃskāras* do dispose the agent to act *indirectly*.

Near the end of the paper, I reconsider the role of the *saṃskāras* that arise directly from actions. If the *saṃskāras* produced by actions are *karmāśayas*, and if *karmāśayas* are analyzed in terms of merit and demerit (as YŚ repeatedly says), then these *saṃskāras* function to produce karmic consequences, whatever they might be. YŚ mentions three types of merit and demerit (*trivipāka*) that arise from *karmāśayas*: attributes and abilities in a subsequent birth (strength, intelligence, species, etc.), lifespan, and experience (of pleasure and pain) (*janmāyur bhoga*) (2.13). These *saṃskāras* are indeed dispositions – *āśayas* – and they are the result of past actions. The dispositions are not obviously dispositions to act, however. Instead, they might simply be understood as dispositions to experience various karmic consequences. My analysis of *karmāśaya*s, then, is this:

\(4\)

action⇒*saṃskāra*/*karmāśaya*⇒ karmic result (attributes/experience/lifespan)

These karmic results, in turn, are not obviously the result of repeated actions in the past. This seems most obvious in the case of lifespan. A person dying at a young age is not generally linked in any common sense, straightforward way to the repetition of wrong action. The most common causes of death – cancer, heart disease, freak accidents, and so on – are not simple, direct results of those vices that garner the most attention – lying, stealing, and so on. Such outcomes are more plausibly the result of some other disposition in the agent – like a disposition to disease – or facts entirely unrelated to the agent – like the fact that some stranger has chosen to drive a car while impaired.

It might be argued that a disposition to disease is a result of past actions, but this would not be a simple matter of actions being repeated. There would have to be some additional mechanism that allowed past actions – like stealing – to produce a disposition to cancer. And most proponents of what I call the standard view do not attempt to argue for this kind of view, preferring, instead, a more “common sense” view, according to which karma is simply the cultivation of dispositions and character that then play out in their ordinary way to give the agent what they deserve. (The liar loses friends, etc.)

As I said at the outset, I think many of the most convincing objections to analyzing karma in terms of action habits are philosophical rather than exegetical. The standard view cannot easily explain how merit and demerit are exhausted, how merit and demerit are related to harming others, and so on (143-146). When *karmāśayas* are analyzed simply as dispositions to experience karmic results, however, these problems do not arise.

At the same time, this alternative account leaves much of the mystery of how karma functions intact. This is unwelcome to those who would prefer a demystified, naturalist, “common sense” – and I would say *apologist* – account of karma. (Although I’ve already suggested with the example of cancer that such proponents might owe a non-naturalist explanation nonetheless!) If the most popular contemporary account is implausible, however, then it is best to continue the search for a more plausible alternative.

Finally, given the strength of the textual evidence that Sharma outlines, there might be more reason to think that actions produce *saṃskāras* that dispose the agent to repeat actions after all. This account, again, would resemble (2) above. If actions do this, then more thought should be given to how this works in the context of actions being motivated by desires for the expected outcomes of action (some of which dispose the agent to never repeat past actions again!). Put another way, we might combine the account diagrammed in (2) above with (3), as follows (where, again the second desire leads back to a repetition of action):

\(5\)

 *saṃskāra* ⇒action

⇗

action 

⇘

directresult⇒desire(for result) ⇒*saṃskāra*⇒desire (for result)

 ⇐ ============================= ==============

We might then wonder how – and whether – these processes might operate in tandem to deliver the agent those consequences that they morally deserve. I don’t believe other scholars have appreciated this complexity. But it is certainly time to stop simply asserting something like (3) above as if it unproblematically explains the mystery of karma.

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) The *Handbook of Indian Philosophy* is generally devoid of Sanskrit terms, for the sake of accessibility. In this post, I revert to the Sanskrit terms, so a simple glossary might help to align the original paper with this post and with Dr. Sharma’s comments.

*saṃskāra*: habit (My preferred translation would be simply ‘dispositions’. I chose ‘habit’ for dramatic effect.)

*vāsanā*: deep dispositions

*karmāśaya*: action deposits

[\[2\]](#_ftnref2) Sharma transliterates the Devanāgari as follows: “*kuśalākuśalāni karmāṇi. tatphalaṃ vipākaḥ. tadanuguṇā vāsanā āśayāḥ*.”

[\[3\]](#_ftnref3) *tatra yad eva dhyānajaṃ cittaṃ* (of these, only that mind which is born from meditation) *tad evānāśayaṃ tasyaiva nāsty āśayo* *rāgādipravṛttir* (that alone does not have *āśaya* having the activity/manifestation of *rāga*, and so on) *nātaḥ puṇyapāpāpbhisambandhaḥ*… (thus, it is not connected with merit and demerit).

[\[4\]](#_ftnref4) I speculate here on what Sharma takes to be the important implication of this verse. I assume he means to assert the latter rather than the former.
