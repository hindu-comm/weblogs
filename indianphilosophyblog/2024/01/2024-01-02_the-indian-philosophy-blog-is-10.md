Sudden and gradual together

The Indian Philosophy Blog began on 2 January 2014; we have now been up for a full ten years â€“ with over 800 posts up by now, exploring Indian philosophy from many different angles, and nearly a thousand current subscribers.

From the start, the IPB has always been a group effort. Thank you to all the contributors who have posted here and left comments. Thank you to Elisa Freschi and Ethan Mills for being co-managers of the blog now, and to Matthew Dasti and Malcolm Keating for playing that role in the past. Thanks also to John Leen for creating a robust backup plan for the site (in case something happens to me!) If you are reading this, thank you as well, for being a part of the community of readers that keeps this blog alive.

Stay tuned, as we have some celebration plans in mind in the year to come. We would like to take this anniversary as an opportunity to think about scholarly networking and collaboration in the field of Indian philosophy in the future. We hope to host a panel at the APA or other conference on the subject, and have some commemorative posts, in the year to come. Thank you again for being part of this journey with us.
