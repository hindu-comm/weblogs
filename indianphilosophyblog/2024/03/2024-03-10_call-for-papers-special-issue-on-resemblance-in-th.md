Further notes on Mīmāṃsā permission

A message from Malcolm Keating (Smith College): Blog readers might be interested in this call for papers on resemblance, which is open to all philosophical traditions. Papers on sādṛśya, upamāna, etc. are welcome.

Call for papers: special issue on resemblance in the Asian Journal of Philosophy

Guest editors:  
Ben Blumson (NUS, Singapore), Malcolm Keating (Smith College, USA)

The nature of similarity (or resemblance) and our epistemic access to it have been important topics in both contemporary philosophy and historical traditions, including, for example, Indian and Medieval European philosophical traditions. This collection of papers in the Asian Journal of Philosophy brings together philosophers across these traditions working on related questions. Topics might include:

Whether similarity facts are fundamental or not

The relationship between universals and resemblance

Whether similarity is objective, subjective, or some combination

How similarity facts are known, if they can be

What the nature of similarity entails for analogical reasoning and/or metaphor

The relationship between representation and resemblance
