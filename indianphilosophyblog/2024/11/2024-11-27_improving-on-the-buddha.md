Remembering Anand Vaidya

Pema Chödrön’s [*When Things Fall Apart*](https://pemachodronfoundation.org/product/when-things-fall-apart-book/) is a beautiful and valuable work on dealing with difficult circumstances. What strikes me in it is how Chödrön – despite being a monk herself – takes a position so deeply at odds with traditional Indian Buddhism.

Chödrön refers to the traditional Buddhist “three marks” (*tilakkhaṇa* or *trilakṣaṇa*) of existence: everything is impermanent, suffering, and non-self. This idea goes back to very early texts. But Chödrön does with it is something quite different from the earlier idea:

> Even though they accurately describe the rock-bottom qualities of our
> existence, these words sound threatening. It’s easy to get the idea
> that there is something wrong with impermanence, suffering, and
> egolessness, which is like thinking that there is something wrong with
> our fundamental situation. But there’s nothing wrong with
> impermanence, suffering, and egolessness; they can be celebrated. Our
> fundamental situation is joyful. (59)

Here’s the problem with this passage: the classical Indian Buddhist texts are quite clear that in fact *there is* something wrong with our fundamental situation. She is disagreeing with them, whether or not she acknowledges it.

Aśvaghoṣa’s Buddha refuses to take joy in our fundamental situation: “I do not despise objects. I know them to be at the heart of human affairs. / But seeing the world to be impermanent, my mind does not delight in them.” (Buddhacarita IV.85) This is very typical of early Indian Buddhist texts. The [Kathāvatthu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kath%C4%81vatthu) says “all conditioned things are, without distinction, cinderheaps” (II.8). The [Theragāthā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theragatha) says: “the body is oozing foulness — always. Bound together with sixty sinews, plastered with a stucco of muscle, wrapped in a jacket of skin, this foul body is of no worth at all.” The goal, in the Pali texts, is to get *out* of “our fundamental situation” – to escape saṃsāra, the wheel of rebirth, into a nirvāṇa that is beyond it.

Nor does this world-rejecting attitude change with Indian Mahāyāna. Śāntideva – on whom Chödrön has written an [entire commentary](https://www.shambhala.com/no-time-to-lose-1966.html) – tells us to reject romantic relationships on the grounds of their impermanence: “For what person is it appropriate to be attached to impermanent beings, when that person is impermanent, when a loved one may not be seen again for thousands of lives?” ([BCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattvacary%C4%81vat%C4%81ra) VIII.5) He regularly criticizes sexual pleasure on the grounds that the body is disgusting and foul. His criticism is not just of attachment to things, but of the things themselves. That is why the bodhisattva must renounce the world in every birth ([ŚS](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-training-anthology-of-santideva-9780199391356) 14).

Thus Chödrön is doing something far removed from the Buddha when she speaks of impermanence in this way: “in the process of trying to deny that things are always changing, we lose our sense of the sacredness of life. We tend to forget that we are a part of the natural scheme of things.” (60) Classically, the natural scheme of things is *bad*, and we’re trying to get *out* of it! Thus [interdependence is not something to be embraced](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/03/buddhists-against-interdependence/); quite the opposite. Interdependence (*pratītya samutpāda*), in Indian Buddhist texts, is a bit like alcoholism: it is absolutely essential that we be aware of its existence, *in order to escape it*. I’ve highlighted points like these [several](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/09/reading-the-deconstruction-of-the-body/) [times](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2022/05/does-the-sigalovada-sutta-prohibit-attending-the-theatre/) [before](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/11/wealth-is-not-neutral/) on Love of All Wisdom: classical Indian Buddhists see the world’s impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness as reasons to reject it.

Now here’s the thing, though: I don’t think that that classical Indian view is *correct!* I stress aspects of Buddhism that I find unappealing because [I think we can learn a lot from them](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2013/06/the-appeal-of-the-unappealing/); [I have done so myself](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/looking-for-coherent-authorship/). But on the question of rejecting the world, I have effectively already sided with Chödrön: [I *don’t* think](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/05/grappling-with-impermanence/) that the impermanence of things is a reason to reject them. I don’t think that the classical Buddhists have made the case for the view that it is – and furthermore, if the [evidence doesn’t support rebirth](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/09/in-defence-of-buddhism-without-rebirth/), as I don’t think it does, then world-rejection may well lead us to suicide or even murder. [Far better to embrace](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/) [the goods of worldly life](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2022/02/the-goods-of-lay-life/).

And yet, like Chödrön, I say all of that [as a faithful Buddhist](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/06/why-i-am-a-buddhist/). Which, finally, leads me to *embrace* Chödrön’s words as the wise advice they are, coming from someone in the Buddha’s lineage who has devoted her life to its path. Śāntideva would never say any of the following, and I don’t care:

> Who ever got the idea that we could have pleasure without pain? It’s
> promoted rather widely in this world, and we buy it. But pain and
> pleasure go together, they are inseparable. They can be celebrated.
> Birth is painful and delightful. Death is painful and delightful. (60)

I had [described another work of Chödrön’s](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/06/my-buddhist-practices/) as Buddhism watered down – but watered down in a good way, like opening up a cask-strength Scotch. And I think the same is true here. This isn’t the Buddha’s Buddhism, but it doesn’t *need* to be.

I don’t know Tibetan tradition all that well, and I don’t know how traditional Chödrön’s views are in Tibet (as opposed to India). I don’t see anything like Chödrön’s approach in, say, [Künzang Sönam’s commentary](https://www.amazon.com/Profound-Reality-Interdependence-Overview-Bodhisattva/dp/0190911913) on Śāntideva. But they could be. I think here of the “nondual mindfulness” that [John Dunne finds](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/06/classical-and-nondual-mindfulness/) in the sixteenth-century work of Wangchuk Dorje: there, a popular modernized Buddhist view not found in classical India (in this case [present-moment mindfulness](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2023/11/in-praise-of-the-present-moment/)) does turn out to have historical antecedent in Tibet.

Even if this view is new to Chödrön and other modern Buddhists, though, I don’t think that’s sufficient reason to reject it. When we take refuge in the Buddha, we want, at some level, to stay faithful to him and his wisdom – but that faith doesn’t need to be blind. I do not believe that the Buddha was omniscient. He [said some wrong and awful things about women](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2022/05/eliminating-and-interpreting-as-buddhists/), after all. Śāntideva’s views were quite different from the Buddha’s own, and probably in some respects an improvement on them. He wouldn’t have admitted that, but *we* can and should. We can potentially improve on his views too – and I think Chödrön does! I’d just like us to [acknowledge that that’s what we’re doing](https://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/03/acknowledging-newness/).
