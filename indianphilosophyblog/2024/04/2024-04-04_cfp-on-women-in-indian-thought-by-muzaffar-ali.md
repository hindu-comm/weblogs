Call for papers: special issue on resemblance in the Asian Journal of Philosophy

As part of an international collaboration, three of us (Muzaffar Ali, Savitribai phule Pune University: Richa Shukla, IIT Bhubaneswar; Mansi Rathour, OP Jindal Global University) will be co-editing a volume, Women in Indian Thought: Ancient, Modern and Contemporary. The main idea behind co-editing this volume is to discuss and bring to the fore previously neglected voices of Indian women thinkers and philosophers.  
We invite interested scholars and academicians to contribute an intellectual biography of any neglected or lesser-known Indian women thinkers/philosophers for the volume. However, you are welcome to submit an essay on other themes provided in the call for papers as well.  
The details for the submission process are provided in the attached link

Kindly contribute and share it with interested candidates, who wish to contribute. The deadline for contributions is 31st May 2024.
