You don’t have to drop philosophy for activism

[Céline Leboeuf](http://www.ccleboeuf.com/) just [interviewed me](https://celineleboeuf.substack.com/p/why-philosophy-amod-sandhya-lele) about philosophy for her “Why Philosophy?” newsletter. I discuss the role that Buddhism and Śāntideva have played in my philosophical formation and conception of philosophy, so I thought the interview might be of interest to readers here.
