Vasubandhu’s Twenty Verses and Comparative Philosophy, Part Two

Readers of the Indian Philosophy Blog may be interested to learn about a new article in the latest issue of the*[Journal of World Philosophies](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/index)*: “*Pramāṇavāda*and the Crisis of Skepticism in the Modern Public Sphere” by Amy Donahue (Kennesaw State University). The journal is open-access, and you can [download the article here.](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/article/view/5879)

Here’s the abstract:

> There is widespread and warranted skepticism about the usefulness of > inclusive and epistemically rigorous public debate in societies that > are modeled on the Habermasian public sphere, and this skepticism > challenges the democratic form of government worldwide. To address > structural weaknesses of Habermasian public spheres, such as > susceptibility to mass manipulation through “ready-to-think” messages > and tendencies to privilege and subordinate perspectives arbitrarily, > interdisciplinary scholars should attend to traditions of knowledge > and public debate that are not rooted in western colonial/modern > genealogies, such as the Sanskritic traditions > of*pramāṇavāda*and*vāda*. Attention to*vāda*,*pramāṇavāda*, and > other traditions like them can inspire new forms of social discussion, media, and digital humanities, which, in turn, can help to place trust in democracy on foundations that are more stable than mere (anxious) optimism.

I enjoyed reading the article, and I found it extremely thought-provoking. I hope readers of this blog will check it out. Also, be sure to look for the forthcoming online debate platform that Donahue mentions on p. 5! Maybe we’ll make an announcement on the blog when it’s ready. Or [reach out to Dr. Donahue](https://radow.kennesaw.edu/historyphilosophy/about/faculty-staff.php) if you’re interested in collaborating.

Here are a few of my questions for further discussion:

1.  Since*pramāṇavāda*was an elite discourse in historical South Asian
    societies and it requires some educational training (as Donahue
    notes on p. 4 and p. 5), can it do the work Donahue asks it to do? 2.  Are*jalpa*and*vitaṇḍā*so bad? While most Naiyāyikas have
    denigrated them as illegitimate as Donahue notes (p. 6), a few have
    distinguished “tricky” and “honest” forms of*vitaṇḍā*(Matilal
    1998, 3). And then there’s Śrī Harṣa’s debate at the beginning of
    the*Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍakhādya*with a Naiyāyika opponent about whether
    one must accept the means of knowledge (*pramāṇas*) in order to
    enter into a debate about the*pramāṇas*(he mentions that one
    understands the discourse of the Madhyamakas and Cārvākas, perhaps
    thinking of Nāgārjuna and Jayarāśi; I will have more to say about
    the Cārvākas in an upcoming conference presentation—see information
    below). Matilal has also argued that*vitaṇḍā*can make sense as
    resulting in a “commitmentless denial” similar to an “illocutionary
    negation” (Matilal 1998, 50-56). In terms of a modern public sphere,
    could*vitaṇḍā*be a useful tactic for, say, pointing out the
    inherent contradictions of various harmful dogmatisms? Or maybe the
    deepest benefit of the*vāda-jalpa-vitaṇḍā*framework is a bit of
    self-awareness about which form of debate one is using? 3.  Is*vāda*necessarily more prone to discrediting false beliefs than
    a Habermasian public sphere or the type of marketplace of ideas in
    John Stuart Mill’s*On Liberty*? (p. 11) My point is most
    definitely*not*that we have nothing to learn from Indian logic and
    debate. Far from it! But I wonder how effective*vāda*can be. After
    all, you don’t find much philosophical agreement in the classical
    Indian tradition, which is precisely why I find it so interesting! 4.  Is the archive (p. 12) essentially part of*vāda,*or is it a
    cultural artifact of the Indian and Tibetan tradition of
    commentaries? Was there something similar in Hellenistic, Roman,
    Islamic, and Byzantine traditions, which were also heavily
    commentarial?

My questions here are meant to be taken in the spirit of*vāda*to keep the conversation going. I hope others will read Donahue’s thought-provoking article and join this worthwhile conversation.

Also, if you will be attending the upcoming Central APA Conference in Denver, Colorado, USA on Feb. 22, 2023, you will have the chance to discuss these and other issues in person!
