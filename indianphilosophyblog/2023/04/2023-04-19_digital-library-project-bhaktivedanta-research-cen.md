Some Memories of My Teacher, J.N. Mohanty

I recently received a note from Prof. Nirmalya Chakraborty (Rabindra Bharati University) about an exciting new digital library. It includes three categories: Navya-Nyāya Scholarship in Nabadwip, Philosophers of Modern India, and Twentieth Century Paṇḍitas of Kolkata. You can find the site here: [https://darshanmanisha.org](https://darshanmanisha.org)

You can learn more about the project from the following announcement.

> Right before the introduction of English education in India, a new > style of philosophising emerged, especially in Bengal, known as > Navya-Nyāya. Since Nabadwip was one of the main centres of Navya-Nyāya > scholarship in Bengal during 15^(th)– 17^(th) Century, many important > works on Navya-Nyāya were written during this period by Nabadwip > scholars. Some of these were published later, but many of these > published works are not available now. The few copies which are > available are also not in good condition. These are the works where Bengal’s intellectual contribution shines forth. We have digitized some of these materials and have uploaded these in the present digital platform. 
> > As a lineage of this Nabadwip tradition, many pandits (traditional > scholars) produced many important philosophical works, some in > Sanskrit and most in Bengali, who were residents of Kolkata during > early nineteenth and twentieth century. Most of these works were > published in early 1900 from Kolkata and some from neighbouring > cities. These works brought in a kind of Renaissance in reviving classical Indian philosophical deliberations in Bengal. Attempts have been made to upload these books and articles in the present digital platform. >
> With the introduction of colonial education, a group of philosophers > got trained in European philosophy and tried to interpret insights > from Classical Indian Philosophy in new light. Kolkata was one of the > main centres of this cosmopolitan philosophical scholarship. The works > of many of these philosophers from Kolkata were published in early/middle of twentieth century. These philosophers are the true representatives of twentieth century Indian philosophy. Efforts have been made to upload these works in the present digital platform. >
> The purpose of constructing the present digital platform is to enable > the researchers to have access to these philosophical works with the hope that the philosophical contributions of these philosophers will be studied and critically assessed resulting in the enrichment of philosophical repertoire. >
> We take this opportunity to appeal to fellow scholars to enrich this digital library by lending us their personal collection related to these areas for digitization. >
> The website address of the Digital Library is: [www.darshanmanisha.org](http://www.darshanmanisha.org) >
