In praise of the present moment

I started thinking about rights while working on permissions, because some deontic logicians think that permissions need to be also independent of prohibitions, in order to ground rights. Now, as I argued elsewhere, Mīmāṃsā permissions are always exceptions to previous negative obligations or prohibitions, so what happens to rights?

  
There is not a directly correspondent concept (how could there be one, given how historically loaded ‘right’ is?), but an interesting parallel is *adhikāra*. How does this work?

  
Let me look, to begin with, at the discussion in the *apaśūdrādhikaraṇa* by Rāmānuja. There, he explains that śūdras (humans belonging to the lowest class) do not have the adhikāra to perform worship (*upāsana*), because they are unable (*asamartha*), even though they desire the result of the action. Why are they unable? Because the do not have the *adhikāra* to perform a part of it, namely *vedādhyayana*.

  
So, as a preliminary understanding:  

*adhikāra* to do x (e.g., *upāsana*) presupposes:

1.  desire to obtain the result of action x 2.  ability to perform action x, which, in turn, presupposes the ability
    to perform each of its parts 3.  \[not yet determined, but see below\]

The interesting part is that according to “as much as possible” principle, one does not need to perform each part of x in order to perform x, if x is a compulsory action (e.g., if you have the duty to each single day, you might leave out polishing each slide every single time). However, you still need to be “able” (*samartha*) to perform each part, even the ones you might have left out.

*asāmarthya* ‘inability’ can be due to physical or economical inability, but could also be the result of the lack of a predecing *adhikāra*. Thus, *adhikāra* has a double relation to *sāmarthya*: a) Lack of *sāmarthya* precludes the possibility *adhikāra* (*adhikāra* presupposes can); b) Lack of *adhikāra* to do x means that one will not get to do x and will therefore be *asamartha* with regard to y, if x is a part of y.

This leads to the *adhikāra* for *vedādhyayana*. This presupposes:

1.  desire to obtain the result of the action 2.  ability to perform the action (see PMS, book 6.1 on animals not
    being able to perform sacrifices) 3.  sanction by an authoritative text

Which kind of sanction? In the case of *vedādhyayana*, it seems to be a positive obligation (or *vidhi*). What would be the distinction between *adhikāra* and any other enjoined action, then? That the *vidhi* which lies at the basis of *adhikāra* establishes one’s general *entitlement* to do x, and not just one’s duty to perform x in a given case.
