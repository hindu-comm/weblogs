Vasubandhu’s Twenty Verses and Comparative Philosophy, Part One

##  CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

***Deadline: 1 February 2023***

We invite proposals for papers to be given at an online conference on varieties of ineffability in ancient philosophy (spanning ancient Chinese, Graeco-Roman and Indian thought), on**18th-21st September 2023**. The conference is expected to take place in the afternoon (British Summer Time) over the course of the four days.

**Confirmed participants:

**Lea Cantor**(Oxford)  
**Amber Carpenter**(Yale-NUS)  
**Ursula Coope**(Oxford)  
**Nilanjan Das**(Toronto)  
**Chris Fraser**(Toronto)

**Adrian Moore**(Oxford)

**Shaul Tor**(KCL)

This conference will examine notions of philosophical ineffability in ancient Chinese, Graeco-Roman and Indian texts, dating up to the 9thcentury CE. By philosophical ineffability we mean the idea that the object of one’s philosophical inquiry, or some aspects of that inquiry itself, are wholly or to some extent beyond the reach of articulation through words. The conference will seek to explore the variety of reasons (sometimes congruent) that might lead a philosopher to adopt some version of an ineffability attitude (e.g. a particular conception of the limits of one’s capacities for knowledge, thought or linguistic expression; a particular ontological stance; secrecy in relation to the uninitiated; a conception of silence as somehow spiritually formative; reverential inhibitions, etc.) as well as the variety of reactions a philosopher might then have in the light of their ineffability attitude (e.g. a qualified or non-committal approach towards the status of one’s own speech; an appeal to metaphors, analogies or periphrasis; some version of the via negativa; silence, etc.). We are interested in how these sorts of motivations and reactions might relate to one another, as well as to wider cultural models on which they sometimes draw. Our aim is not to attempt or approximate comprehensive coverage, nor to offer a survey. Instead, the conference will seek to explore case-studies stemming from the three traditions that, in conjunction, will show something of the variety and richness of the phenomenon of ineffability in ancient philosophy. We welcome both papers that take a fresh look at famous examples and papers that examine cases that are less often discussed. It is hoped that the consideration of a diverse range of ineffability attitudes, as well as the adoption of a comparative, cross-cultural perspective, will throw into sharp relief different patterns of philosophical preoccupations and strategies, and indeed will offer one particular and productive angle from which to think about the scope and orientation of some central aspects of ancient philosophy.

**CfA Eligibility & submission guidelines**

We invite abstracts of**300-500 words**from researchers at all levels (abstracts from graduate students and ECRs are particularly welcome),**suitable for 30- to 35-minute presentations**.
