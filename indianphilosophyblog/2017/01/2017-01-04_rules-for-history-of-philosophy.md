Rules for History of Philosophy

In the comments to Shyam’s [recent post on interpretation vs
explication](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/12/29/interpretation-vs-explication-ii-choosing-between-a-truth-and-objectivity/#comment-181656),
I left a link to Peter Adamson’s recent post,”[Rules for History of
Philosophy.](http://historyofphilosophy.net/rules-history-philosophy)”
While I imagine many readers will have already seen it (it’s been posted
elsewhere), perhaps some of you have thoughts about these rules in light
of Shyam’s post, or in light of their applicability to Indian philosophy
more specifically?

In particular, I appreciate his Rule 15: Be broadminded about what
counts as “philosophy”, since we have already discussed a few times the
philosophical importance of *śāstra*s like
*[nīti](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/10/12/niti-and-the-two-ways-of-using-texts/),
[vyākaraṇa](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/08/14/jnapaka-in-sanskrit-and-pali-grammar/)*
and
[*alaṁkāra*](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/01/16/da%e1%b9%87%e1%b8%8din-and-the-philosophy-of-poetics/).
Are there other ways in which we should be more broadminded, and how
should this impact our doing philosophy?
