New issue of Philosophy East and West (67.1, January 2017)

This issue is pretty light on Indian philosophy, as its theme is “Joseph
Chan’s Confucian Perfectionism.” But it does feature Chris Framarin’s
article “Renunciation, Pleasure, and the Good Life in the Saṃnyāsa
Upaniṣads” and David Nowakowski’s review of*Rethinking the Buddha:
Early Buddhist Philosophy as Meditative Perception,*by Eviatar Shulman.
