**CALL FOR PAPERS**

**South Asian Studies: Pedagogy and Community Building**

19th – 21st April, 2017

Annual Symposium

Center for South Asian Studies,University of Hawaii at Manoa

**Deadline for abstracts – February 15, 2017**

**Notification of acceptance – February 20, 2017**

This conference aims to self-reflexively understand the connections
between academia andcommunity building. As scholars and pedagogues, we
cultivate critical thinking in ourselves andour students as our central
learning objective. We recognize that it is indeed one crucial part
ofour role in the world, but that an equally critical approach to
action and community engagementis imperative to our collective life.
How do we bridge critical thinking with critical caring andcritical
action? How do our scholarly pursuits and teaching practices in South
Asian Studiesextend to community building? How do we and our pedagogy
foster communities of compassionand kindness, of resilience and
resistance, of creativity and performing arts, political and
socialactivism, heritage and diversity, identity and empowerment,
linguistic revitalization, health andhealing, environment and
sustainability, and of many other aspects. In that process, how do
weunderstand our own identities as academics, scholars, teachers,
artists, activists, communityleaders, and peacebuilders? Conversely,
how do communities, whether inclusive or exclusionary,employ certain
pedagogical approaches to accomplish their set goals? How do state,
nongovernmental,religious, or other institutions, play roles in
expanding or drawing boundariesaround communities? How have the
intersections of pedagogy and community played outhistorically,
geographically, ideologically, economically, cross-culturally etc.? What
have beenthe challenges and rewards, complexities and clarities,
frustrations and joys?

For our Spring Symposium 2017 we invite abstracts for papers or creative
presentations thataddress these and related themes with regard to South
Asia. We invite proposals thatproblematize the central terms: pedagogy,
community, peace, critical caring, and action, etc. Weinvite papers
