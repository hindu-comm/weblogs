Special issue of the Journal of Indian Philosophy: Mahābhārata

A [new special issue](https://link.springer.com/journal/10781/45/4) of
the *Journal of Indian Philosophy* is dedicated to “Locating Philosophy
in the *Mahābhārata*.” James L. Fitzgerald introduces the articles in a
[paper available online without institutional
access](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10781-017-9324-4.pdf).

We’ve talked on the blog before (examples
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/10/12/niti-and-the-two-ways-of-using-texts/)
and [here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/01/19/hindu-ethics/))
about locating Indian ethics and political thought in genres not
traditionally identified as “philosophical.” Much work remains to be
done on this topic, and Fitzgerald concludes his introductory essay
reflecting on the next steps in the study of epic philosophy:

> 
>
> First, we all need to pay close attention to the narrative medium
> which the authorial agents of the MBh used for their philosophizing
> and in and against which they set and framed the philosophizing of
> others. Secondly, with much less sparkle on its surface, we need to
> add to the basic research of earlier generations of scholars on the
> contents of the text: systematic and methodical surveys of words and
> ideas and careful study of each textual construction for itself. The
> digital resources we have at our disposal today make this basic
> research and study much more convenient than it was in the past, but
> the fundamental requirement is still the meeting of human minds that
> must occur ‘in real time’ as sentence after sentence is read and
> argument upon argument is slowly pondered.
>
> 

I would add to Fitzgerald’s last remarks that collaborative work seems
especially important here, since to think about literature as philosophy
involves a broad skillset: thinking philosophically, but also
narratively, historically, text-critically, philologically.
