The Deontic Nature of Language

According to the Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā approach to language, the sentence
meaning is “something to be done” (kārya). In other words, unlike for
Nyāya authors, sentences do not convey the existence of something, but
rather that something should be done. Sentences which look as if they
were conveying a descriptive statements should be interpreted as
supplementing a (at times implicit) prescriptive one. For instance
`It is hot here" is a supplement of`Please, open the window” and
`Vāyu is the swiftest deity" is a supplement of`One should sacrifice to
Vāyu”.

Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā authors do not agree with this analysis if applied to
ordinary language which, they state, can also convey the description of
states of affairs, but they agree that Vedic sentences only convey
prescriptive contents.

This thesis has important epistemological and logical outputs.
Epistemologically, it implies that the Veda is an instrument of
knowledge only in relation to duties. By contrast, sense perception,
inference, etc. only convey knowledge about what exists. Therefore, the
knowledge of duties conveyed by Vedic sentences cannot be falsified by
sense-perception, inference, etc., which convey a completely different
set of contents. Therefore, since duties cannot be known through any
other instrument of knowledge but the Veda, the Veda remains
unfalsifiable.

From the point of view of deontic logic, the Mīmāṃsā analysis
differentiates between prescriptions (vidhi) and prohibitions (niṣedha).
These are distinguished on the basis of their leading or not to fruits
and not on the basis of their linguistic form.

Mīmāṃsā authors developed the above theory also in opposition to Vedānta
authors, who claimed that the Veda conveys descriptive contents about
the brahman and the ātman.
