The Indian theory of taste

I am an amateur at Indian aesthetic theory. I have not studied it much;
I can read its Sanskrit source texts, but with some difficulty given how
much they allude to literary and dramatic works I don’t know. As with
Confucianism and Islamic Aristotelianism, it is a field where I cannot
claim significant expertise. Yet I continue to [find myself drawn to
it](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/03/an-aesthetic-of-extremes/),
finding ideas that strike me as valuable and relevant – most recently
reading [Sheldon Pollock’s wonderful Rasa
Reader](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/a-rasa-reader/9780231173902),
right from the first excerpt .

The earliest known extant text of Indian aesthetic theory is [Bharata’s
Nāṭya Śāstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra). This text,
circa 300 CE, sets out the concept of *rasa*, central to nearly all
later Indian aesthetic thought. *Rasa*, roughly, refers to the emotion
involved in a dramatic or literary work. The tradition often disagrees
on where this *rasa* exists: the actor, the audience, the character, the
author or even the work itself. But they all know that the Sanskrit word
*rasa* literally means “taste”; it continues to refer to the sense of
taste long after it has developed this more dramatic sense. And this
meaning matters. Reading Pollock’s excerpt from Bharata, I am struck by
the passage in Bharata’s chapter 6 where he defines *rasa*:

> Here one might ask: What does ‘rasa’ actually mean? Our answer is that
> rasa is so called because it is something savored. And how can rasa be
> said to be ‘savored’? Just as discerning people relish tastes when
> eating food prepared with various condiments \[*vyañjana*\] and in
> doing so find pleasure, so discerning viewers relish the stable
> emotions when they are manifested by the acting out of various
> transitory emotions and reactions and accompanied by the other acting
> registers (the verbal, physical, and psychophysical), and they find
> pleasure in doing so. This explains why we call them ‘dramatic rasas,’
> or tastes. On this matter there are two traditional verses:
>
> (6.32-33) Just as connoisseurs eat and savor their fare when prepared
> with many condiments and substances, so the learned fully savor in
> their heart the stable emotions when conjoined with the factors,
> transitory emotions, and reactions. That is why they are called
> dramatic rasas, or ‘tastes.’ (Pollock 51, pp 282-3 in the
> Krishnamoorthy Sanskrit edition)

I am excited here by the way the enjoyment of food serves as the root
explanation for aesthetics. We might first note the key role that
*pleasure*, relishing, plays in the arts Bharata describes here – in
contrast to the grim 20th-century “continental” aesthetic theorists,
like Milan Kundera and [Theodor
Adorno](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/), who disdain the
pleasurable works that they condemn as
[kitsch](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2013/12/kitsch/). But more
specifically, I think Bharata’s theory serves as a powerful contrast to
the problematic understanding of food expressed by [Leon Kass and
Michael
Pollan](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/08/whats-eating-michael-pollan/).
Sanskritic thinkers always attached great significance to etymology; the
derivation of dramatic *rasa* from gustatory *rasa* here is no mere
metaphor. It *matters* to Bharata that the relishing of dramatic emotion
is analogous to the pleasure of eating. We can explain the pleasures of
the transitory art object that is a dramatic performance with reference
to the transitory art object that is well-spiced food. Kass takes the
fact that food’s pleasures are ephemeral as a reason to consider them
lesser – a criticism, again, would seem to apply to drama (or music) in
a way that Kass never notices. Bharata has no such compunctions: food
and drama are real arts worth savouring.

We are similarly far away from Pollan and his austere, depressing advice
to “avoid food products containing ingredients that are more than five
in number”. Here, unlike in Pollan, the pleasure in a delicious dish
does *not* come from the substance of the dish proper – the obsession
with a small and simple set of fresh ingredients that so bedevils
currently fashionable North American food. No, it comes from the
*vyañjana*s – what Pollock translates as “condiment”, and often means
“spices”. It is the *spicing* of food that is fundamental to its good
flavour, enough to make the proper analogy to drama. And it is never
just one spice, but various spices conjoined together, just as dramatic
*rasa* conjoins various forms of emotion.
[Bhoja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoja)‘s Śṛṅgāra Prakāśa, a later
aesthetic treatise, goes further: he compares poetic *rasa*‘s
combination of literary elements to “the case of prepared food, where we
have the combination of sweet, sour, salty, and the ‘six-spice
substance’…” (ŚP 617, quoted on Pollock 127) Bhoja further adds later in
the text:

> There must be a “continuous presence” or multiplicity of \[\_rasa_s\]
> to be savored – with rasas producing emotions, emotions rasas, and
> rasas rasas – so that the literary work does not become devoid of
> rasa, or insipid, like a meal that has only a single taste.

While it is always a dangerous game to make a leap from classical
philosophy to contemporary culture, it’s hard not to notice how much
better Bharata’s approach would describe the foods we know of South and
Southeast Asia – so heavily spiced, their flavour coming from the likes
of pepper and ginger and onions and garlic and mustard. And, of course,
chile peppers – a much later innovation, imported by the Portuguese, but
one which South Asians took up with far greater gusto than the
Portuguese themselves ever did! We might note as well that Bhoja’s
description of the combination of four tastes – sour, sweet, salt, spice
– has achieved almost cliché status as a description of Thai food. (Thai
culture is as Indian as northern European culture is Greek – the Thais
get not only Buddhism and literature like the Rāmāyana, but aesthetic
concepts like
[*saksit*](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/03/the-power-of-a-beautiful-temple/),
from the Indians.)

Pollock in his introduction seems somewhat puzzled by the way Indian
thinkers use the sense of taste as the key concept – as English-speakers
do with the significantly different concept of “good taste”. What I
think he might be missing is the idea of *food as art*. We do have such
a concept in the West, but it is peripheral to our understanding of art
and beauty, as Kass demonstrates in his brief and easy dismissal of the
pleasures of eating. There *are* Westerners who have a deeper
understanding of the pleasures of food – most notably [Jean Anthelme
Brillat-Savarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Anthelme_Brillat-Savarin),
who said, among other things, that “the discovery of a new dish does
more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star” – but few
would give him centre stage in their theory of aesthetics.

Relatedly: In Bharata’s theory in particular, *rasa* is something
inherent in the actor – because it derives from the combination of the
*actor’s* own emotions. This idea is familiar to me from the works of
[Konstantin
Stanislavski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Stanislavski),
who urges actors to draw the emotions they display from personal
experiences where they have felt similar emotion. I’ve already noted the
way Stanislavski’s theories help us understand *rasa* theory in a
[devotional
context](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/to-play-a-flawed-role/).
It appears the resemblance goes deeper than that. But Stanislavski, like
Brillat-Savarin, stands far on the periphery of Western aesthetic theory
as I understand it, whether “continental” or analytic. I am tempted to
say we should learn from Bharata and give Brillat-Savarin and
Stanislavski a more central place.
