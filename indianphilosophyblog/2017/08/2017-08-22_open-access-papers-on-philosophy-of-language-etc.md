Open access papers on philosophy of language etc.

For a lucky coincidence, two long term projects of mine reached
completion almost at the same time.

You can therefore read on the 2017 issue of the [Journal of World
Philosophies](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/issue/view/32)
the (Open Access) papers on philosophy of language which are the result
of a project led by Malcolm Keating and myself (see
[here](http://elisafreschi.com/2015/06/12/linguistic-communication-as-an-instrument-of-knowledge-a-panel/)).
I am grateful to the journal’s editor, Monika Kirloskar-Steinbach for
her help and support throughout the process.

On the 2017 issue
[Kervan](http://www.ojs.unito.it/index.php/kervan/issue/view/207) you
can read the lead papers on epistemology of testimony, printed cultures
and conceptualisation of sexuality which are the result of the 2013
Coffee Break Conference held in Turin and edited by Daniele Cuneo,
Camillo Formigatti and myself. I am grateful to the journal’s editor,
Mauro Tosco for his help and support throughout the process.

Enjoy and please let me know your comments and criticisms!
