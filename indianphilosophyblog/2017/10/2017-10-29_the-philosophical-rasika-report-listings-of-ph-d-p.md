The Philosophical Rasika Report: Listings of Ph.D. Programs in Indian Philosophy (2017 Edition; Part I: North America)

**Preface to the 2017 Edition**

Since the original guide to Ph.D. programs in North America was first
compiled in 2014, some scholars have been newly hired, have moved, or
have retired, necessitating revisions to the list. Among these moves
are:

Michael S. Allen (Hampden-Sydney College) moved to University of
Virginia  
Douglas Berger (Southern Illinois University) moved to Leiden
University  
Purushottama Bilimoria (Deakin University) moved to Graduate Theological
Union  
Nicholas Bommarito hired by University at Buffalo, SUNY  
Arindam Chakrabarti (University of Hawaii at Manoa) will move in 2018 to
Stony Brook University, SUNY  
John D. Dunne (Emory University) moved to University of Wisconsin at
Madison  
Jonathan Edelmann (Mississippi State University) moved to University of
Florida  
Pierre-Julien Harter hired by University of New Mexico  
Sonam Kachru hired by University of Virginia  
Rita D. Sherma hired by Graduate Theological Union

The larger points made in the introduction, however, remain as true in
2017 as they were in 2014.

**Introduction**

When I was an undergraduate I was lucky to have a mentor who had
recently received her Ph.D. in a field related to my interests, and who
gave me good, up-to-date advice on the most prominent scholars and
programs in my field. Now that I find myself advising my own
undergraduate students, I have been struck by just how confusing the
situation for the academic study of Indian philosophy will seem to an
outsider. First of all, most scholars in Europe and North America who
work on Indian philosophy did not earn their doctoral degrees from
Philosophy Ph.D. programs. Furthermore, most Philosophy Departments in
North America and Europe will not even consider an applicant for
doctoral training whose main research interest is Indian philosophy. I
found this out the hard way over two decades ago when I went against my
mentor’s advice and applied to a prominent philosophy graduate program.
I later found out that my application had been immediately set aside by
the admission committee because I had stated in my personal essay that I
intended to pursue research in both classical Indian and 19th century
European philosophy. The committee eventually lost my application and
never even gave me the courtesy of a rejection letter.

Making up for such Eurocentric biases of philosophy departments,
nowadays Indian philosophy is often taught in two other places:
Religious Studies departments and Asian Studies departments. The three
different types of programs tend to have different foci. Departments of
Asian Studies, also sometimes labeled as Oriental Studies or Indology,
often have a philological focus. This is especially the case in Europe.
Religious Studies departments tend to provide their students with
training in philosophy of religion, comparative religions, and theology,
tools that can often be useful in approaching texts and thinkers from
South Asia. Finally, there are a few Philosophy Departments that have
successfully incorporated Asian philosophy into their curricula, and
where it might finally be possible to research Pyrrho, Nāgārjuna, and
Zhuangzi side-by-side. In the lists we have compiled for the Indian
Philosophy Blog we have included all three types of programs. In
choosing programs to apply to, students would be well advised to track
down representative publications by one or two of the scholars of Indian
philosophy in each of the programs they are considering. This will give
them a sense of the kind of training they would receive and the kind of
writing they would be expected to produce for their Ph.D. dissertations
in each program.

The lists compiled here are specifically for Ph.D. programs.
Undergraduate students should be aware that in most cases they will be
expected to earn an M.A. in a relevant field before they can be admitted
to a Ph.D. program. Most departments that offer the Ph.D. also offer the
M.A., with some exceptions. Students applying to an M.A. program will
typically be expected to have one or two years of background in a
relevant language
([Sanskrit](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/01/19/the-languages-of-indian-philosophy/),
Pali,
[Prakrit](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/10/11/language-of-the-snakes-available-for-download-or-purchase/),
Tibetan, etc.). Admission into a Ph.D. program often requires the
equivalent of two or more years of language study. Undergraduate
students of Indian philosophy whose universities do not offer
instruction in Asian languages would be wise to pursue [summer
study](http://sasli.wisc.edu/) elsewhere. University funding is not
always available for the M.A. For the Ph.D., however, students studying
in North America should insist on full funding: a complete tuition
waiver plus a substantial stipend. With the exception of the Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México, the language of instruction of the Ph.D.
programs on this North America list is English.

Students are, naturally, most concerned with getting into an M.A. or
Ph.D. program. However, they should also give a great deal of thought to
how long it will take to get out, how much debt will accrue during their
studies, and what kind of job they should expect to find after they
graduate. Because of the extensive language training required for
original research in Indian philosophy and the expectation that many
students will spend time doing research abroad, completion of a program
of study in Indian philosophy often takes longer than a comparable
program in European philosophy. After they are admitted, students should
grill the graduate program director on the program’s job placement rate
and on what kinds of jobs its recent graduates have received. (2-year
research fellowships? 3-year Visiting Assistant Professorships?
Tenure-Track Professorships?)

A very serious factor students must take into account is the amount of
debt they will amass and whether they will ever make enough money as a
professor in a humanities department to pay off those debts. This is a
[particularly large problem in the United
States.](http://theprofessorisin.com/ph-d-debt-survey/) Because of the
high cost of graduate studies and the daunting odds of landing a
tenure-track job, some prominent voices have [warned against anyone
pursuing a humanities doctoral degree in the United
States](http://www.chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the/44846).
Though the situations in Indian philosophy, South Asian Studies, and
Religious Studies are better than in some other humanities disciplines,
students should arrive in graduate school with their eyes wide open.
B.A.-, M.A.-, and Ph.D.-holders should also keep in mind that it is
possible to have a fulfilling, intellectually rewarding career [beyond
the ivory tower.](http://fromphdtolife.com/resources/)

In my opinion, it would be folly to try to give an overall ranking of
Ph.D. programs in Indian philosophy. The types of disciplinary
approaches and topics covered are too diverse. However, it is useful to
ask questions about the top programs for the study of specific topics in
Indian philosophy, such as Kashmir Śaivism or Yogācāra Buddhism. Perhaps
the comments section would be a good place to begin such a conversation.

The lists of Ph.D programs in Indian philosophy, Part One for North
America and Part Two for Europe were originally compiled by Andrew J.
Nicholson (me) and Elisa Freschi, respectively, in 2014. (The original
lists can be found
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/03/17/the-philosophical-rasika-report-listings-of-ph-d-programs-in-indian-philosophy-part-i-north-america/)
and
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2014/03/26/phd-programs-in-indian-philosophy-part-2-europe/).)
We plan to continue to revise these lists approximately once every three
years. [Elisa Freschi’s revised list for
Europe](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/11/02/phd-programs-in-indian-philosophy-in-europe-2017-edition/)
will appear in November 2017. Additionally, in December 2017 we plan to
add a Part Three, a guide to Ph.D. programs for Indian Philosophy in
India. I wish to thank Amod Lele, Shyam Ranganathan, Borayin Larios, and
Elsa Cross for helping me with the North America list. Any errors or
omissions are my own fault.
