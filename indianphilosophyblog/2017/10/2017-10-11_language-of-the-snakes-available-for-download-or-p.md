the book:

> *Language of the Snakes* traces the history of the Prakrit language as
> a literary phenomenon, starting from its cultivation in courts of the
> Deccan in the first centuries of the common era. Although little
> studied today, Prakrit was an important vector of the *kāvya* movement
> and once joined Sanskrit at the apex of classical Indian literary
> culture. The opposition between Prakrit and Sanskrit was at the center
> of an enduring “language order” in India, a set of ways of thinking
> about, naming, classifying, representing, and ultimately using
> languages. As a language of classical literature that nevertheless
> retained its associations with more demotic language practices,
> Prakrit both embodies major cultural tensions—between high and low,
> transregional and regional, cosmopolitan and vernacular—and provides a
> unique perspective onto the history of literature and culture in South
> Asia.
