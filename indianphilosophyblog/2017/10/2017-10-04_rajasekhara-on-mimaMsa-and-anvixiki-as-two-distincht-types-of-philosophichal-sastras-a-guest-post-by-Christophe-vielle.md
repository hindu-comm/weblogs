Rājaśekhara on mīmāṃsā and ānvīkṣikī as two distinct types of philosophical śāstras—a guest post by Christophe Vielle

(I am grateful for the following learned and thought-provoking guest
post I received from Christophe Vielle, dealing with an emic way to
define “Philosophy” in the Indian context. EF)

Rājaśekhara’s classification of śāstras in the Kāvyamīmāṃsā, adhyāya 2
(śāstra-nirdeśa)\*, is the following:  
1. apauruṣeya = śruti (mantra-brāhmaṇa) + upavedas + vedāṅgas  
2. pauruṣeya = purāṇa, ānvīkṣikī, mīmāṃsā, smṛti-tantra  
2.1. purāṇa (+ itihāsa)  
2.2. ānvīkṣikī  
2.2.1. pūrvapakṣa : arhat, bhadanta, lokāyata  
2.2.2. uttararapakṣa : sāṅkhya, nyāya, vaiśeṣika :  
(ta ime ṣaṭ tarkāḥ \| tatra ca tisraḥ kathā bhavanti vādo jalpo vitaṇḍā
ca \|  
madhyasthayos tattvāvabodhāya vastutattvaparāmarśo vādaḥ \|  
vijigīṣoḥ svapakṣasiddhaye chalajātinigrahādiparigraho jalpaḥ \|  
svapakṣasyāparigrahitrī parapakṣasya dūṣayitrī vitaṇḍā \|)  
2.3. mīmāṃsā : (nigamavākyānāṃ nyāyaiḥ sahasreṇa vivektrī mīmāṃsā \| sā
ca dvividhā vidhivivecanī brahmanidarśanī ca \|)  
2.4. smṛtayaḥ

The matter is in fact a bit more complicated, with a discussion on the
number of vidyāsthānas occuring between 2.4. and 2.2.1-2 (these
vidyāsthānas are numbered 14 if 4 vedas + 6 vedāṅgas + 4 \[types of
pauruṣeya\] śāstras are counted; different views are quoted), and the
special place given here and there to the art of poetry. At the end of
the chapter, there are interesting definitions of formal types of works:
sūtra, in which the śāstras were originally composed, vṛtti, paddhati,
bhāṣya, samīkṣā, ṭīkā, pañjikā, kārikā, vārtika and prakaraṇa.

Rājaśekhara’s distinction between mīmāṃsā and ānvīkṣikī as two different
types of śāstras is noteworthy. For him (dated to the early 10th
century) the former is of two kinds, corresponding to karma- (‘pūrva”)
and brahma- (“uttara”) mīmāṃsā, the aim of both being to discriminate
among/to interpret the Vedic vākyas by means of/on the basis of thousand
of nyāyas. The latter corresponds to six tarkas “logics” (tarka can also
be here equated to darśana), three belonging to the pūrvapakṣa: the
Jaina (arhat), Bauddha (bhadanta) and materialistic ones; three to the
uttarapakṣa: the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika ones. These 6 tarkas use 3
types of kathās “\[argumentative\] talks”: vāda (the sound argument for
convincing mediators in disputes), jalpa (the attempt to defeat one’s
rival by means of unsound arguments) and vitaṇḍā (destructive criticism,
without substantiating one’s own point of view).(\*\*)  
I would be interested by textual parallels to, or scholarly comments on,
such a classification.

(\*\*) On these three kinds of kathā “debate“ (vāda “discussion“, jalpa
“disputation”, vitaṇḍā “wrangling”) according to the NS (1.2.1-3) and
their commentaries, see Esther A. Solomon, Indian Dialectics I, pp.
