APA Newsletter on B. K. Matilal Now Available!

Regular blog readers may remember [my earlier
posts](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/05/24/submissions-for-apa-newsletter-issue-on-matilal-due-june-1/)
that I was co-editing, along with Prasanta Bandyopadhyay, the Fall 2017
edition of the*[APA Newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers
and Philosophies](http://www.apaonline.org/?asian_newsletter). *The
theme of the issue is “B. K. Matilal: The Past and Future of the Study
of Indian Philosophy.” I am happy to announce that the issue is [now
available!](http://www.apaonline.org/page/asian_newsletter)

The issue contains the following articles.

-   “An Exemplary Indian Intellectual: Bimal Krishna Matilal,” Jonardon
    Ganeri
-   “Philosophy, Indian and Western: Some Thoughts from Bimal Matilal,”
    Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad
-   “Bimal Krishna Matilal’s Style of Doing Philosophy,” Richard Hayes
-   “Three Dogmas of Matilal: Direct Realism, Lingophilia, and Dharma
    Ethics,” Purushottama Bilimoria
-   “A Cautionary Note on Matilal’s Way of Doing Indian Philosophy,”
    Nirmalya Narayan Chakraborty
-   “Whither the Matilal Strategy?,” Ethan Mills
-   “Nyāya Ethical Theory,” Kisor K. Chakrabarti
-   “Bimal Krishna Matilal and the EnduringSignificance of the
    Constructive Engagement Between Contemporary Analytic and Classical
    Indian Philosophy,” Anand Jayprakash Vaidya
-   “Expanding Matilal’s Project through First-Person Research,” Neil
    Sims

I am extremely thankful to my co-editor and the contributors. I think
it turned out really well (although I may be biased, of course).
