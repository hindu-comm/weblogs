Nyāyasūtra translation is now available

Friends, Elisa kindly asked me to note when Stephen and my Nyāyasūtra
volume was available for purchase (and not just preorder). It is now.
Thanks, Elisa. If anyone is interested, you can find it
here:<https://www.hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/the-nyaya-sutra>

Hackett has $4.00 examination copies available for those who want to
glance at it in consideration of using it for teaching.
