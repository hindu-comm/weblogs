The challenge of postcolonial philosophy in India. Too alien for contemporary philosophers, too modern for Sanskritists?

A conference on the topic announced in the title will take place in
Vienna, 28–29.9.2017. The purpose of the conference is to break the
boundaries between “classical” and “contemporary” Indian philosophy and
between “Indian” and “philosophy”, so as to make it possible for Indian
philosophy and philosophers to become part of the ongoing discussion on
topics such as ethics, logics and epistemology. You can announce your
participation to elisa dot freschi at oeaw dot ac dot at
