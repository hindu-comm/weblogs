Walking down the footsteps of the Buddha—An invitation by Debajyoti Gangopadhyay

Nalanda Dialog Mission, Hazaribag, in collaboration with INTACH,
Hazaribag chapter, is going to conduct a Walk (Padyatra) down the River
Mohani from Itkhori Chatra (Jharkhand) to Bodhgaya (Bihar) during
13th–15th of January 2018. A discussion Seminar will be held on the 2nd
day.

This Padyatra is intended to commemorate Prince Siddhartha’s journey
down this river as the local myths claim. Local myths corroborate the
Sakya Prince Siddhartha’s extensive journey through the today’s
Jharkhand before he was enlightened in Urubela village near Gaya.

5th Century B. C. is famously known as the embryonic phases of
developments of Indian Philosophy as well as many of our cultural
hallmarks – a vibrant period incubating different belief systems of
diverse metaphysical origins geographically located mostly in today’s
Bihar. The entire region, extending all the way from the southern bank
of the river Ganga to present Chotanagpur plateau, was actually a hub of
parallel cultures of so called non-Vedic origins.

The nomadic people here of different diasporic as well as ethnic origins
including the tribal like Santhal, Munda, Oraon, Asura were something
like bulk of floating masses with belief and practices incompatible with
those prevalent in North Bihar.  
Though Buddha and Mahavīra’s fundamental teaching were outgrowth, in one
way or other, of these all incompatibilities, our later mainstream
history of philosophy is mostly depleted off these early pre-enlightment
accounts of mutual rejection and assimilation took place specifically in
South Bihar. However, sporadic remains of these early conflicts are
still visible in Hazaribag and surroundings though masked in many
different ways by mist of time.

Please treat this post as intimation as well as invitation to take part
in this Padyatra. Detailed Program as well as the Registration procedure
soon follows with further relevant information.
