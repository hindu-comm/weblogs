Pain and freedom in K.C. Bhattacharya: A question

A colleague from the Savitribai Phule Pune University, Prof. [Muzaffar
Ali](http://unipune.academia.edu/MuzaffarAli), sent us this question
concerning K.C. Bhattacharya. Can readers help?

> “To reflect on the feeling of pain is necessarily to wish to be free
> from it. To wish anything is to think that it may be attained. To
> necessarily wish something is to believe that it not only may but can
> be attained, that it cannot be unattainable. The necessary wish for
> freedom from pain is then the unquestionable belief that it can be
> attained. The necessity of the wish further implies that it is
> constitutive of the feeling of pain which yet is distinct from it. The
> wish presupposes the belief in the facthood of pain and yet if the
> wish were absent, there would be no feeling of pain, for what is not
> wished to be terminated is not felt pain. The wish for freedom is the
> reflective self or reason itself which thus has to be regarded as
> conditioning the facthood of pain and as therefore, acting suicidally.
> Reflection on pain, though implying the possibility of freedom from
> it, is in this sense an evil, the potentiality of pain. Reflection
> thus develops into reflection on itself as evil, freedom from which
> too is necessarily wished. The wish for freedom from the reflective
> wish to be free from pain is spiritual wish, the latter wish being
> secular. It is the necessary wish for absolute freedom, freedom not

> realisability of the actuality.”

K. C. Bhattacharya (hereafter KCB) starts the chapter “Pain as Evil”
from his Studies in Sāṅkhya Philosophy with this paragraph after
offering a brief definition of what *mukti* stands for. I have been
trying hard to grasp the meaning of this dense paragraph and after
numerous readings, I am still at doubt.

According to my naïve understanding KCB argues that within our
consciousness there is a parallel and simultaneous movement of two
strains: One of the feeling of pain and the other (in the form of a
wish) of the reflection to get rid of it. The simultaneous presence of
these two opposing strains forms the core of contradictory character of
pain, as one strain constantly tries to oppose the other. Yet both
exist. Later on he attempts to divide the wish for freedom or *mukti*
into a) secular wish and b) spiritual wish.

It seems to me that according to KCB secular wish is the “reflective
wish” (one which accompanies the feeling of pain) to get rid of pain as
a fact i.e. pain as being felt by consciousness. Spiritual wish on the
other hand is something more complex. It attempts to get rid of not only
pain but of the secular wish as well. Only the spiritual wish can lead
to absolute freedom or *mukti*. Is this interpretation right? Is
spiritual wish more holistic than the secular one? What is the rationale
behind dividing the wish for *mukti* into two?

Apart from a brief mention of KCB in *Classical Sāṃkhya: An
Interpretation of Its History and Meaning* by Gerald James Larson, I
have not been able to find any secondary source which can of help in
grasping the nuances of KCB’s creative understanding of pain and
*mukti*. At the end I decided to post it on the blog to get help from
scholars of Indian philosophy across the globe.
