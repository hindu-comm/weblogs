Arindam Chakrabarti to SUNY Stony Brook

From Andrew Nicholson:

I have some exciting news to report: Arindam Chakrabarti of U Hawaii has
accepted a position at Stony Brook as the inaugural Nirmal and Augustina
Mattoo Chair of Classical Indic Humanities. His principal appointment
will be in the Philosophy Department, with an affiliate appointment in
the Department of Asian and Asian American Studies. He will begin
teaching here in the fall semester of 2018.

I hope that his arrival here will make Stony Brookâ€™s Ph.D. program in
philosophy a destination for students interested in studying not only
continental European traditions, but also ancient and modern Indian
philosophies.

Below is a link to the ad announcing his hire from the Sep. 1 edition of
the Chronicle of Higher Education.
