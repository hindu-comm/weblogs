In defence of Buddhism without rebirth

A few years ago I wondered how a [naturalized
Buddhism](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2012/04/good-karma-as-eudaimonia/)
could avoid [advocating
suicide](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/01/without-rebirth-suicide/).
If our goal is the cessation of suffering, *and* death is not the
beginning of a new birth but a simple ending, shouldn’t death itself be
our goal? I didn’t go very far with this argument, in part because I
didn’t identify as a Buddhist at the time – there was a certain way in
which not being a Buddhist made it not *my* problem. But now [I am a
Buddhist](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/05/i-am-a-buddhist/). And
an excellent recent chapter by Jan Westerhoff, in [Jake Davis’s fine new
edited volume on Buddhist
ethics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-mirror-is-for-reflection-9780190499761?lang=en&cc=us),
brings the point back into uncomfortable focus.

Westerhoff argues that a Buddhism without rebirth is simply incoherent –
unless, that is, it is willing to bite the bullet and accept that
committing suicide is the best response to life. (Which he presumes,
probably rightly, that it isn’t.) He spells out the problem:

> The central goal of the Buddhist path is the complete and permanent
> eradication of suffering (duḥkha). If there is no continuity of mind
> after the decay of this physical body, and if the existence of our
> mind depends on the existence of our body, the third Noble Truth, the
> truth of the cessation of suffering, would be to put an end to the
> existence of this body, and the fourth Noble Truth, the way to this
> cessation, would be suicide. This would lead to the permanent
> destruction of the complex of the five skandhas, the
> physico-psychological elements that make up the person, thereby
> leading to the complete elimination of suffering. In this case none of
> the three trainings of ethics, meditation, and wisdom would be
> necessary for the cessation of suffering, but the simple act of
> destroying the body would be sufficient. (149)

The logic here is hard to dispute. A very large number of the Pali
Buddhist texts are phrased in negative terms: ethical injunctions are
injunctions to *not* do things, in order to get out of suffering. But
Mahāyāna does not necessarily fare any better – if the goal is to end
the suffering of other sentient beings, then the logical course of
action moves from suicide to murder.

Westerhoff’s position is that Buddhism logically *requires* rebirth;
coherence requires that one give up either Buddhism or that form of
naturalism that rejects rebirth. Strikingly, he does not take the first
option as one might expect – to declare that science has simply refuted
Buddhism. Rather, he urges Buddhists to follow a path very similar to
Christian “creation scientists”, and hunt for scientific avenues that
would allow Buddhist conceptions of rebirth to be coherent:

> This approach would begin with a careful analysis of the Buddhist
> doctrinal position on mental continuity, rebirth, and karma and would
> subsequently try to determine which of the positions in contemporary
> cognitive science and the philosophy of mind might be compatible with
> it, and which would be most suited to explaining the view of the mind
> the Buddhist thinkers developed. (159)

I commend Westerhoff for the boldness of that proposal. I have seen few
others willing to take such a step. Still, I reject it. The history of
creation science, as I understand it, is a sad and pathetic one – full
of ever more desperate attempts at special pleading to show the biblical
understanding of creation as compatible with an ever-increasing body of
observations that show no support for it. It seems to me the perfect
example of what [Imre
Lakatos](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lakatos/) calls a
degenerating research program: one that does not progress because it
does not anticipate novel facts, and becomes littered with an ever
larger pile of anomalies. The future for Buddhists who emulate creation
science does not look bright. And it seems to me that to cling to
whatever flimsy theoretical and empirical support might be offered for
rebirth, is exactly to emulate creation science.

I do note here the work of [Ian
Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stevenson), who has managed
to provide *some* small evidence that is, in his words, “suggestive of
reincarnation”. But there are two problems with taking Stevenson’s work
as a foundation for living as a Buddhist. First, as far as I am aware,
even Stevenson – who provides the best observational evidence for
rebirth I am aware of – does not provide any evidence that this rebirth
is, in [Gananath Obeyesekere’s
terms](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520232433), *ethicized*.
That is to say, even if were to take the generous view that humans *can*
be reborn, we would have no particular reason – aside from Buddhist
texts telling us so – to believe that that rebirth has anything to do
with karma\_ There is no connection established between the ethical
quality of our actions in this life and the well-being of our future
lives.

True, even such a non-ethicized rebirth might go some way to answering
the suicide objection, making suicide appear futile at best. But that
brings us to the second problem, which is that work like Stevenson’s is
an awfully thin thread to hang our worldview on. It is not just that his
work is disputed ([though it
is](https://www.amazon.com/Reincarnation-Critical-Examination-Paul-Edwards/dp/1573929212));
even Stevenson himself merely identifies his cases as *suggestive* of
reincarnation. It would hardly be a surprise if attempts to confirm it
amounted to nothing. It is not difficult at all to imagine a
rebirth-based research program degenerating as far and as quickly as has
[intelligent
design](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/06/wilber-and-aurobindo-on-intelligent-design/).
And what then? If Westerhoff were right that Buddhism and a rebirth-free
naturalism were incompatible, a commitment to truth would *require* that
we reject Buddhism out of hand. I find it a more promising strategy to
preserve a Buddhism that does not require rebirth. But that does indeed
require finding an answer to the suicide objection. How may we do that?
More next time.
