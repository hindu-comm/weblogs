Bhakti in Rāmānuja: Continuities and changes of perspective

(The following is my attempt to make sense of Rāmānuja’s conceptions of
bhakti. Comments and criticisms are welcome!)

To Rāmānuja (traditional dates 1017–1137) are attributed, with more or
less certainty, a series of Vedāntic works, namely the Śrī Bhāṣya
(henceforth ŚrīBh) commentary on the Brahma Sūtra (henceforth UMS),
which is his philosophical opus magnum, both in length and philosophical
depth, the Gītabhāṣya on the Bhagavadgītā (henceforth BhG), a compendium
of his philosophy, the Vedārthasaṅgraha, and two shorter commentaries on
the UMS, namely the Vedāntadīpa and the Vedāntasāra.  
Beside these works, the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta school, at least since the
time of Sudarśana Sūri and Veṅkaṭanātha (also called Vedānta Deśika,
traditional dates 1269–1370), recognised Rāmānuja as the author of also
three extremely short works (about 3–4 pages each), namely the
Śaraṇāgatigadya, the Śrīraṅgagadya and the Vaikuṇṭhagadya, and of a
manual of daily worship called Nityagrantha.

The terms bhakti `devotional love' and bhakta`devotee’ are not very
frequent in the ŚrīBh, where they are mentioned slightly more than ten
times, a portion of which in quotes (some of which from the BhG). By
contrast, the Śaraṇāgatigadya mentions bhakti 19 times in its only 23
sentences, and adds further elements to it (such as Nārāyaṇa instead of
Kṛṣṇa as the object of devotion, and the role of prapatti
‘self-surrender’, see immediately below). Does this mean that the
Śaraṇāgatigadya is not by Rāmānuja and represents a further stage in the
theological thought of Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta? Alternatively, one might
suggest that Rāmānuja addressed different audiences in his philosophical
and in his religious works. In other words, the difference between the
position of the ŚrīBh and that of the Śaraṇāgatigadya could be only due
to the fact that the first develops a philosophical discourse about God,
whereas the latter enacts the author’s relationship with Him.

In the ŚrīBh, bhakti is the (only) way to make sense of the previous
obligations taught in the karma- and in the jñānamārga, which it
therefore subsumes. For instance, the next two passages show how bhakti
leads to the cessation of nescience and results in the attainment of
brahman/God.

> hṛdayaguhāyām upāsanaprakāram, upāsanasya ca parabhaktirūpatvam,
> upāsīnasya avidyā-vimokapūrvakaṃ brahmasamaṃ brahmānubhavaphalaṃ ca
> upadiśya upasaṃhṛtam \| (ad 1.2.23)
>
> I have taught and now sum up the modality of contemplation in the cave
> of one’s heart, the fact that veneration has the form of supreme
> bhakti, and the result, being the experience of brahman, which is
> tantamount to the brahman and is caused by the cessation of nescience
> in the one who venerates.

The word upāsana is even more clearly connected with the jñānamārga,
insofar as Rāmānuja shows how the salvific knowledge which can defeat
nescience must consist of upāsana, since a sheer cognition would not be
enough (see Marlewicz 2010):

> atrocyate – yad uktam – avidyānivṛttir eva mokṣaḥ, sā ca
> brahmavijñānād eva bhavati iti, tad abhyupagamyate. avidyānivṛttaye
> vedāntavākyair vidhitsitaṃ jñānaṃ kiṃrūpam iti vivecanīyam – kiṃ
> vākyād vākyārthajñānamātram, uta tanmūlam upāsanātmakaṃ jñānam iti. na
> tāvat vākyajanyaṃ jñānam \[…\] ato vākyārthajñānād anyad eva
> dhyānopāsanādiśabdavācyaṃ jñānaṃ vedāntavākyair vidhitsatam (ŚrīBh ad
> 1.1.1)
>
> In this regard we need to answer \[to the Advaitins\]: We accept what

> nescience and that this occurs due to the cognition of the brahman.  
> It is to be discussed what this knowledge intended to be enjoined by

> the nescience is like? Is it only the knowledge of the

> which has the nature of the devout contemplation (upāsana), based on
> this (sentence-meaning)? Regarding the first alternative — this
> knowledge is not originating \[merely\] from the sentence \[\\dots\]
> Therefore, the Upaniṣadic sentences enjoin something different than

> words such as meditation and devout contemplation.

In the Gītābhāṣya, prapatti is introduced as a preliminary step before
bhakti, but so powerful that it can substitute karma- and jñānamārga
completely. This move could be due at least also to the second person
perspective of the Arjuna-Kṛṣṇa dialogue, which could have oriented
Rāmānuja’s understanding of bhakti and prapatti as soteriological means:
Arjuna’s desperation makes Kṛṣṇa soothe him by suggesting him an
immediate path.

The role of bhakti in the Śaraṇāgatigadya is in harmony with its role in
the Gītābhāṣya, namely a preliminary step before undertaking bhaktiyoga.
However, the Śaraṇāgatigadya has been traditionally interpreted as a
narrative about Rāmānuja’s own act of śaraṇāgati and as enjoining
primarily śaraṇāgati. Why?

In fact, the Śaraṇāgatigadya presents an interesting conundrum: It
contains most of the themes which will later become standard in the
later treatments of bhakti and prapatti, but in a poetic form.  
The elements which are deemed to influence for a long time the
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta school, in particular, are:

-   The presence of different ways of addressing God, as attested by the
    endless series of attributes in vv. 1, 5 etc. and explicitly
    thematised in v. 7 (as against the Northern Indian way to venerate
    God under one aspect, e.g., as child or as spouse)
-   The role of Śrī as mediator: the author does not address directly
    Nārāyaṇa, but first her and only once her intermediation has taken
    place does he address Nārāyaṇa.
-   The localisation of God, in this case in Śrīraṅga (see v. 19).
-   The connection of kaiṅkarya \`servitude’ and rati \`love’ as opposed
    to a pure ritualistic servitude or to a differently flavoured love
    (vātsalya \`tender love towards one’s child’, etc.).
-   The reuse (non literal in the case of the Śaraṇāgatigadya, literal
    in later texts) of BhG 18.66 (later known as the caramaśloka \`the
    final verse’) in the context of taking refuge.
-   The reuse of other verses of the BhG (see vv. 13–15).
-   Prapatti that appears to be performed as a speech act (performed in
    vv. 1–2 in regard to Śrī and then in v. 5 in regard to Nārāyaṇa)
    which is not repeatable (v. 6 in fact speaks of it in the past
    and v. 16 displays what was wished for in v. 1 as already
    accomplished).
-   The author’s feeling the need to ask God to be forgiven for his
    endless shortcomings (in a way which reminds one of Yāmuna’s
    Stotraratna and of the Āḻvārs.
-   The seeming predominance of prapatti over bhakti (partly against
    Rāmānuja’s other works, see above and below).
-   The fact that nothing is needed to perform prapatti apart from the
    awareness of not having any other way left. One must feel desperate
    and derelict, with no other possible way left. In the terminology of
    the Śaraṇāgatigadya one needs to be ananyaśaraṇa \`with no other
    refuge’.

The last element, namely the awareness of one’s wreckedness, was already
present in the Āḻvārs’ poems and, more interestingly, also in Yāmuna’s
Stotraratna. This brings one back to the complex relation between
Rāmānuja and Yāmuna. The latter is addressed with respect twice (once in
the maṅgala) in the former’s Vedārthasaṅgraha, but is not mentioned at
all in Rāmānuja’s opus magnum, his ŚrīBh, which seems to focus only on
inner-Vedānta issues (more on the “isolation” of the ŚrīBh below).

The most significant element to be discussed in regard to the role of
the Śaraṇāgatigadya within Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta is the second to last
one. Prapatti is clearly omnipresent in the Śaraṇāgatigadya, but nowhere
is it said that it is a different path as bhakti (in fact, the sequence
from v. 6 to vv. 13 to 15 appears to imply that bhakti must be
accomplished once one has done prapatti). Thus, prapatti remains a
preliminary element providing an easy entrance into bhakti, which
remains the only salvific path. The later and typically Viśiṣṭādvaita
Vedānta idea of prapatti as an independent path and as the only feasible
one, alternative to the unrealistic path of bhakti, appears not to be
there yet.

**The first person perspective in the Śaraṇāgatigadya**  
Yāmuna’s Stotraratna is a hymn to God written from the first-person
perspective and including the literary persona of its author as a deeply
troubled devout, who needs help from God. Probably elaborating on this
motif, the Śaraṇāgatigadya presents itself as an invocation to God by a
similar kind of believer. The interesting innovation in this case is the
fact that the author speaks first to Śrī and then to Nārāyaṇa and, more
importantly, that both answer him. Śrī is addressed with many
attributes, elaborating on her various aspects (v. 1). The author asks
her to let him take refuge (v.2). Śrī accords that with only a few words
(vv. 3–4). Next come long invocations (vv. 5–17, especially v. 5) to
Nārāyaṇa, containing the request to take refuge in God and then to
become a bhakta. In v. 5, God is addressed with a seemingly endless
series of attributes, covering approximately 20 lines of Sanskrit,
before the crisp request of taking refuge. Similarly, the author
describes at length his inadequateness (v. 16). Are all these words just
ornamental? Probably not. The long process of uttering God’s attributes
and one’s shortcomings might be itself part of the salvific process of
becoming aware of His greatness and of one’s inadequacy. In other words,
by painfully listing one’s shortcomings the author (and, perhaps, his
ideal audience) becomes aware of their all-pervasive nature, and of the
fact that they are not emendable. The author says, in fact, that he will
continue performing evil acts even in the future (v. 10) and that he
therefore absolutely needs God’s help. Nārāyaṇa, unlike Śrī, answers at
length (vv. 17–24). The answer is ultimately positive: the author’s
desire will be fulfilled (v. 21). He should not doubt it (v. 22–23).
Still, Nārāyaṇa comes to this positive result after having Himself
enumerated the author’s shortcomings (in a list longer than the author’s
one). That is, the wish is ultimately fulfilled, but not automatically
and as the result of a compassion that Nārāyaṇa shows to be even more
necessary than the author had thought. The narrative and dialogical
structure of the text appear, therefore, to have a profound impact on
the doctrine propounded, namely, prapatti. Without this structure, the
text would occupy only a few lines, stating that once one has obtained
prapatti through God’s mercy, one can become a bhakta. Within the
structure, however, the same content gets a different connotation,
insofar as both the request(s) and the response are delayed enough to
show the difficulty of what has just been requested and the wondrous
nature of God’s compassion.

**Conclusions**  
Bhakti plays in the ŚrīBh an exclusive role and śaraṇāgati is not even
mentioned. Apart from this fundamental difference, many elements in the
Śaraṇāgatigadya are altogether absent in the ŚrīBh. These differences
have been until now interpreted (see Lester and, for a different and
more cautious opinion, Raman) as evidences against Rāmānuja’s authorship
of the Śaraṇāgatigadya. At the same time, the Śaraṇāgatigadya is
perfectly integrated in the Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta thought, both insofar
as it summarises the key elements in its doctrine of prapatti and
insofar as it contains several elements already evoked in the Āḻvārs’
hymns and even in Yāmuna’s ones. It is, in this sense, not surprising
that Sudarśana Sūri and even more Veṅkaṭanātha saw in the
Śaraṇāgatigadya a key text within their tradition (Veṅkaṭanātha’s
commentary on the Śaraṇāgatigadya covers 50 pages, whereas the ones on
the other gadyas only a few pages each). The case of the
Śaraṇāgatigadya, in the sense, rather shows the relative isolation of
the ŚrīBh from Śrī Vaiṣṇavism. This text lays the metaphysical
foundations of the Viśiṣṭādvaita school, but remained distant from its
devotional aspects (for instance, unlike the Gītābhāṣya and the
Vedārthasaṅgraha, it does not salute Yāmuna in the initial maṅgala and
rather evokes previous Vedānta teachers). Bhakti is discussed within the
ŚrīBh as the only way to reach God, but from a detached, third-person
perspective. The existential dimension of the difficulties hidden in
this ideal picture start coming to the foreground in the Gītabhāṣya
(still written from a third person perspective, but incorporating also
the second-person perspective of Arjuna’s and Kṛṣṇa’s dialogue) and then
more incisively so in the first person perspective of the
Śaraṇāgatigadya.
