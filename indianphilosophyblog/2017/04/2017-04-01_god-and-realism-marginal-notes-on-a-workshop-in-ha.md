God and realism. Marginal notes on a workshop in Hawai’i, part 2

Can God as the perfect omniscient knower guarantee the possibility of a
reality disidentified from all local perspectives and thus independent
of them, though remaining inherently intelligible (by God Himself)? It
depends on how one understands God.

As discussed already
[here](http://elisafreschi.com/2016/11/23/analytical-philosophy-of-religion-with-indian-categories/),
Indian authors can mean at least four different things when they speak
about “God”, namely:

1.  —the *devatā*s of mythology, like Indra and Zeus (during this
    workshop in Hawai’s, Andrew Nicholson has shown several examples of
    how philosophers make fun of this naive conception of Gods)
2.  —the *īśvara* of rational theology. He is usually omniscient and
    omnipotent and mostly also benevolent. In Indian thought, He can be
    proven to exist and to be such through rational arguments (e.g.,
    through an inference from the fact that mountains, being an effect,
    need a creator, like pots).
3.  —the *brahman* of Advaita Vedānta is an impersonal Deity. In some
    forms of Vedānta it is interpreted pantheistically as tantamount to
    the universe.
4.  —the *bhagavat* kind of God is the one one is linked to through a
    personal relationship. His or Her devotees might consider Him
    omniscient or omnipotent, but in fact their reasons for loving Him
    of Her are different and regard their being in relation with Him or
    Her.

Which God can help guaranteeing the world’s reality? The *devatā* kind
of Gods are clearly irrelevant for this purpose, since they are not even
omniscient and surely do not represent an impartial perspective. The
*brahman* kind of God is omniscient only in a sense akin to the Buddha’s
being omniscient, namely insofar as it does not lack any relevant
information, but it does not at all guarantee the reality of the world
of direct realism. In fact, the world is for Advaita Vedāntins an
illusion.

The *īśvara* kind of God seems the best candidate. But which kind of
*īśvara*? Matthew [Dasti](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewdasti/)‘s
talk elaborated on the early history of *īśvara* in Nyāya, showing how
the system’s basic premisses at least facilitated the elaboration of an
*īśvara* concept. This evolution culminates in a full-fledged rational
theology by Udayana. For Udayana, the *īśvara* he tries to prove
rationally is not just any intelligent maker that can be inferred as the
cause from the premise that the earth, mountains and plants sprouting
from it are effects. That intelligent maker had to be:\*

-   A super-soul with eternal knowledge of everything, and especially of
    the past and future good and bad actions of all human beings that
    ever lived.
-   One who has natural control or lordship over the material universe
    and other individual souls whose bodies he creates according to
    their beginninglessly earned merits and demerits.
-   One who joins the eternal atoms in the beginning of each cosmic
    cycle according to a remembered blue-print giving rise to the
    two-ness in a dyad by his primordial act of counting.
-   One who makes the otherwise unconscious “destiny” (unseen karmic
    traces, *adṛṣṭa*)) or law of moral retribution work.
-   One who acts directly through his eternal will and agency without
    the mediation of a body, although all the “intelligent makers” one
    has ever encountered produce effects with a body of their own.
-   One who composes the Vedas which tell human beings how to live a
    good life, through “do”s and “don’t”s, which would otherwise be
    devoid of the imperative force that they command.
-   One who establishes the conventional connection between primitive
    words and their meant entities.
-   One who, after creating the world, also sustains and in the fullness
    of time destroys it.
-   Showers grace on humans and other creatures so that each soul can
    eventually attain their summum bonum—final liberation from all
    ensnaring karma and suffering.
-   One who remains constantly and uniformly blissful through all these
    actions which do not touch his changeless essence and for which he
    has no “need”.

Such an *īśvara* has been discussed by Arindam Chakrabarti in his final
talk on Vācaspati, insofar as He seems to be the only kind of God who
can be said to be omniscient in the “hard” sense of possessing a
complete knowledge of all states of affairs. However, He is vulnerable
to objections to omniscience raised both in European and Indian
philosophy. E.g.: How to delimit the range of “all” in
“[omniscience](http://elisafreschi.com/2017/03/22/omniscience-and-realism/)“?
Can He really know also future events? If so, this seems to contradict
our free will and even the possibility of non-necessary, contingent
events. More in general, how can God know past and future events as
such, though being Himself atemporal (this topic has been dealt with by
Shinya Moriyama in his talk as well as in his 2014
[book](http://www.indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/3324))? Not to speak of
the pragmatic problems caused by omniscience, namely that it is
altogether different from the way we usually experience knowledge to
happen, i.e. in a processual way, and that one could never be sure that
anyone (even God) is omniscient, since we are not omniscient and,
therefore, could not test Him. Last, as outlined by Arindam (and by
Patrick Grimm’s Cantorian argument against omniscience), God’s
omniscience seems deemed to fail, since it cannot be proven to be
logically conceivable.

The general problem appears to me to be that the *īśvara* is at the same
time the knower of all and *part* of the system which He should know
completely, so that He cannot escape the restrictions which apply to
this world (in which knowledge is experienced to be processual, entities
are not at the same time temporal and non-temporal, and one element
cannot know the whole).

\*The following points are all discussed by Udayana. For further
details, see Chemparathy 1972. The present formulation of the list is
largely indebted to Arindam Chakrabarti.

Shinya Moriyama also wrote a report about the same workshop,
unfortunately (for me) in Japanese. Google translate was enough to
understand that it is quite interesting and gives one a perceptive
insight in the Philosophy Department in Hawai’i. You can read it
[here](http://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/faculty/arts/prof/moriyama_1/2017/03/101544.html).
