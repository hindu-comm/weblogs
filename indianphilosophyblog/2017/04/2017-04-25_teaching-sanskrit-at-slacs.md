Teaching Sanskrit at SLACs

Recently I tried to gather, on my own, information about which small
liberal arts colleges(SLACs) in the United States teach Sanskrit. I was
unable to find any centralized place where such a list is kept. Through
some Googling, I was able to identify a few colleges and email with some
instructors. I thought that maybe others would be interested in this
information, and perhaps sharing their own college’s experience? Or
perhaps someone knows of a website with this information?

The reason for my interest in this question is because we have students
at Yale-NUS College who want to learn Sanskrit, but it’s
administratively challenging to set up and support such a program for
small numbers of students. Currently, we have students doing some
distance learning with Yale University, some students who go to
[Rangjung Yeshe Institute](http://www.ryi.org/) over the summer, and
I’ve done both formal independent studies and informal reading groups
with the students. All of our students read the *Rāmāyaṇa* and the
*Bhagavad Gītā* in translation during their first year along with some
Nyāya, Vedānta, and Buddhist philosophy. I think this has spurred a lot
of their interest in learning Sanskrit, along with having Amber
Carpenter and Gavin Flood on faculty.

So, based on cursory initial research, I found the following four SLACs
that teach Sanskrit, and was able to talk to the instructors at many of
them:

-   [Bard College](http://classicalstudies.bard.edu/languages/)
-   [Elizabethtown
    College](http://catalog.etown.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=6617)
-   [Lebanon Valley
    College](http://www.lvc.edu/academics/programs-of-study/religion/world-classics-minor/)
-   [Skidmore
    College](http://catalog.skidmore.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=15&coid=29907)

The [Five College Consortium](https://www.fivecolleges.edu/) (Amherst
College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, UMass
Amherst) also offers Sanskrit, but through UMass Amherst, which isn’t an
SLAC. I’m sure I’ve missed other schools. Please add yours in the
comment, whether small liberal arts or any other kind (US and
elsewhere!). I think we all know which major research universities teach
Sanskrit, but it might be useful to know who else is teaching in other
contexts.
