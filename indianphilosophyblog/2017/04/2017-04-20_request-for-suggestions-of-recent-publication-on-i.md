Request for Suggestions of Recent Publication on Indian or Hindu Philosophy

Hello all

I’m tasked with updating two online (OBO) bibliographies: one on Indian
philosophy (in general 2011) and the other on Hindu philosophy (2016).

To this end, I would appreciate suggestions regarding stand out
publications from the last seven years (in Indian philosophy) or the
last two years (on Hindu philosophy)

No worries about self promotion: I’d be happy to hear about everyone’s
work and for everyone to toot their own horn! I will be constrained in
part by the format of the bibliography in deciding what I can include,
but I am hoping that all such suggestions will make the light of day if
they are included as a response to this blog post. Of course, you can
also send me your requests privately (if you can*’t* find my email
address, you can send me an note [here:

Thanks,

Shyam
