Notice of forthcoming publication

Friends, for those of you who teach Indian philosophy regularly and may
be teaching in the fall, I wanted to give notice that Stephen Phillips
and my translation of the Nyāyasūtra with early commentaries will be out
in September. Hackett has an early webpage up now, and it will be
fleshed out in coming
months:<https://www.hackettpublishing.com/new-forthcoming/new-2017-titles/the-nyaya-sutra>

We’ve done our best to make this as accessible as possible for
undergraduate teaching without sacrificing accuracy. It is also select:
we have included the portions thought most relevant to direct
philosophical engagement with the school in the least cumbersome way.

I thought I’d mention it now since some people may be looking for Nyāya
materials they can use in the classroom, and we sometimes have to do our
course prep fairly early in the summer in anticipation of the fall
semester.
