Sanskrit philosophical tandem?

Dear readers and co-bloggers, a colleague of mine, who is professor of
philosophy in the US and works on German and English philosophy, started
studying Sanskrit about one year ago. He is now at the point where he
would just need to read texts, but there are no Sanskritists in his
area. Do you happen to know of someone who could be interested in
reading with him some easy śāstra text? In exchange, he could read with
her/him German or English philosophical texts. You can also answer me
with a private email (my name dot my surname at gmail dot com).
