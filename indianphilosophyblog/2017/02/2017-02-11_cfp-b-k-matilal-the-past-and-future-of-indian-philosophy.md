CFP: B. K. Matilal: The Past and Future of Indian Philosophy

I have agreed to guest edit, along with Prasanta Bandyopadhyay, the Fall
2017 edition of the *[APA Newsletter on Asian and Asian-American
Philosophers and
Philosophies.](http://www.apaonline.org/?asian_newsletter)*The theme
of the issue will be “B. K. Matilal: The Past and Future of Indian
Philosophy.” Please see the Call for Papers below. Submissions are due
June 1, 2017.

A recent issue of the journal*Sophia* has a similar theme (see [our
post on that
issue](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/01/30/latest-issue-of-sophia/)).
I’m hoping this issue of the newsletter might compliment
the*Sophia*issue. Additionally, we will consider submissions that are
not directly responding to Matilal’s work. Papers on issues with which
Matilal was concerned such as philosophical methodology or specific
topics in Indian philosophy will be considered.

**Call for Papers**

**B. K. Matilal: The Past and Future of Indian Philosophy**

B. K. Matilal (1935-1991) had an extraordinary influence on the
direction of the study of Indian philosophy during his lifetime and this
influence has grown in the 25 years since his untimely death. *The APA
Newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies*
seeks short papers (1000-3000 words) on the legacy of B. K. Matilal and
his influence, both direct and indirect, on the study of Indian
philosophy today and into the future. Topics might include, but are not
limited to:

-   Matilal is known for his efforts at comparing classical Indian and
    contemporary analytic philosophy. Is this a promising strategy for
    scholars of Indian philosophy today, or are there other
    methodological approaches that might be just as fruitful? Might
    Matilal’s approach be combined with other approaches? For
    instance,Matilal himself became more interested in continental
    philosophy toward the end of his life, and healways considered his
    work to be a kind of history of philosophy as well.

-   What were Matilal’s reasons for engaging in analytic-Indian
    comparative projects? Are his reasons still relevant going forward
    into the future of the study of Indian philosophy?

-   How have Matial’s contributions in areas such as logic,
    epistemology, ethics, the philosophical relevance of literature,
    etc. added to contemporary understandings of these topics? What are
    some avenues for new research in these areas that might be inspired
    by Matilal, either directly or indirectly?

-   How has the story of Matilal’s legacy been told in the last 25
    years? How is he likely to be remembered into the future?

*Please submit your paper of roughly 1000-3000 words to Ethan Mills
(Ethan-Mills@utc.edu) by June 1, 2017. Papers chosen for publication
will appear in the Fall 2017 issue of the newsletter.*
