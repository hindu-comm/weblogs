Summary paper on Ganeri’s The Self

[Philosophical Studies](https://link.springer.com/journal/11098) has
recently published a short summary by Jonardon Ganeri of the project he
has undertaken his ground breaking book, [The Self: Naturalism,
Consciousness, and the First-Person
Stance.](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-self-9780199652365?cc=us&lang=en&)For
those who don’t have the time to engage at length with the book, it is
an excellent way to understand his (multi-work) investigations into the
self and the way he integrates both contemporary philosophy of
mind/cog-sci, and the classical Indian thinkers.
