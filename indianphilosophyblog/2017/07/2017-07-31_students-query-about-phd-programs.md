Student’s query about PhD programs

A student contacted me with the following query:

> I recently finished an MA in philosophy at the University of New
> mexico, USA. \[…\] I’m writing you because it has been difficult to
> find a place where I can pursue the project I’m most interested in. I
> would like to develop scientific and philosophical methods for
> evaluating the experiential claims made in the meditative traditions
> of India, and apply whatever data emerges to philosophy of
> mind/consciousness studies. Do you have any suggestions about where
> such a project might be done?

When I asked for further details, he added:

> I studied Vedānta, Mīmāṃsā, and the Indian debates about consciousness
> and self, with John Taber, and I studied Nāgārjuna with Richard Hayes.
> My MA research was on representationalist theories of consciousness
> and how they do not seem to be able to account for purportedly
> contentless experiences such asamprajñāta samādhi. I have already
> started on several facets of the project I suggested in my first
> message. For instance, I have a paper briefly sketching the project
> coming out in the Fall APA Newsletter on Asian and Asian American
> Philosophy, a co-authored paper in the revise and resubmit phase with
> the Journal of Consciousness Studies, using phenomenological reports
> of specific meditative experiences to illuminate a poorly understood
> aspect of Kurt Gödel’s proof of his Incompleteness Theorem(s), a
> co-authored paper in development on third-person scientific approaches
> to meditation research for The Oxford Handbook on Meditation, and a
> co-edited book on objectless experience under contract with the
> publisher Imprint Academic.
>
> Financial support would be a must, although moving to some areas would
> be easier than others.

Do readers have useful suggestions? As I see it, the student would need
both financial and research support (it would not make much sense to
work on his own on such a challenging project).
