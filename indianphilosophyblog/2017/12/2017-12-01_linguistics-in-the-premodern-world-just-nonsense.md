“Linguistics in the premodern world? Just nonsense!”

Patrick [O’Donnell](https://independent.academia.edu/PatrickSODonnell),
who also contributed to this blog, recently published an interesting
[response](http://www.religiousleftlaw.com/2017/09/the-indic-or-indian-contribution-to-grammar-linguistics-and-the-philosophy-of-language.html)
to the above argument, as found in
[this](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-linguistics-such-a-magnet-for-dilettantes-and-crackpots)
article by Gaston Dorren. Dorren’s main claim is:

> While all disciplines attract the occasional eccentric, it seems that
> two fields exert a particularly strong pull: historiography and
> linguistics.

Now, it would be fine to say that many excentric thoughts have been
uttered about languages wihout any basis. I would add that many
excentric thoughts have been uttered also about many other topics, say
ways to salvation, but less us live it aside.  
The main point is that Dorren does not say that *the topic of language*,
but that *linguistics* itself is “a magnet for dilettantes and
crackpots”. You would think that Sanskrit authors working on language do
not belong to either category, but here is all what Dorren has to say
about them:

> Other cultures were equally self-complacent. In the last centuries
> BCE, the people of North India felt that their Sanskrit was nothing
> less than divine, and 1,000 years later the Arabs would feel likewise
> about the language of the Quran. For the Chinese, civilising the
> neighbouring peoples was practically tantamount to familiarising them
> with the only great language. The French of the Enlightenment, not to
> be outdone, deemed their language better than divine – it was logical.
> \[…\]  
> Speakers of big languages are not the only ones to get carried away by
> love for their lingo. Quite a few people in Tamil Nadu in South India
> used quite literally to consider the Tamil language a goddess, and
> some still do.

Look, I enjoyed Dorren’s discussion about how many people described
their own language as the oldest or the best and I can see that in some
cases these theories where the only ones about language in a given
context. But it is hard to conclude from these wishful thinkings about
Sanskrit to the conclusion that one can close the chapter of Indian
linguistics (as a scholarly field) in this way.
