International Seminar at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute, Kolkata

Next week I’m very pleased to be participating in a seminar at the
Ramakrishna Mission Institute, Kolkata, along with co-blogger Anand
Vaidya and a range of esteemed scholars (see program
[here](http://sriramakrishna.org/news/509)). Jaysankar Lal Shaw, whose
work was recently collected in a book [discussed on the blog (review by
Purushottama Billmoria, who also will be
there)](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/11/10/ndpr-review-of-the-collected-writings-of-jaysankar-lal-shaw-indian-analytic-and-anglophone-philosophy/),
will be giving the keynote. If I have time, I’ll write a blog post after
the seminar with some thoughts.

[Description from site](http://sriramakrishna.org/news/509): “To
commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sister Nivedita the Institute
is organizing an International Seminar from 2nd January to 4th January
2018 highlighting Sister Nivedita’s interpretation of Swami Vivekananda
and her Cross-Cultural-Multidisciplinary philosophy.”
