Naturalizing Śāntideva’s eudaimonism

My [disagreements with Charles
Goodman](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/11/santideva-vs-singer/)
continue with his contribution to Jake Davis’s thought-provoking volume
[A Mirror Is For
Reflection](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-mirror-is-for-reflection-9780190499761?lang=en&cc=us).
(I’ve [previously
written](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/09/in-defence-of-buddhism-without-rebirth/)
about Jan Westerhoff’s chapter in the same book.) Just like Westerhoff,
Charles is exploring the important question of [naturalizing
karma](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/06/naturalizing-karma/). He
does so with particular reference to Śāntideva. He opens with a
beautiful reading of Śikṣā Samuccaya chapter 4’s graphic descriptions of
the punishments a wrongdoer will face in the hells, reading them in
terms of the actions’ psychological effects on the wrongdoer.

The problem with this reading is that it doesn’t go far enough. Charles
acknowledges that in many cases a wrongdoer will indeed suffer for
wrongdoing. But, he claims, not all:

> It seems very hard to resist the claim that there will be at least
> certain rare cases of spectacularly profitable wrongdoing that will
> supply the perpetrator with plentiful material resources for life,
> with relatively little chance of failure or of being caught. In these
> cases, a credible understanding of the nature and scope of the
> psychological ill effects of wrongdoing is unlikely to imply that the
> perpetrator’s well-being will be reduced by carrying out such an act.
> (139)

Charles, of course, knows that Śāntideva does not remotely believe this
claim. For Śāntideva, in the case at issue, a perpetrator’s well-being
will indeed be decidedly reduced by this profitable wrongdoing. But in
Charles’s interpretation, the *only* thing that would reduce the
perpetrator’s well-being would be the supernatural form of karmic
fruition, where the perpetrator has bad rebirths:

> So if there is nothing more to karma than the workings of our
> psychology, as the modern view claims, then morality and self-interest
> will sometimes fail to coincide. The cases in which they diverge are
> likely to be rare; unfortunately, potential criminals will probably
> perceive them as diverging far more often than they actually do. But
> the theoretical point remains: Absent some heroic defense that has yet
> to be provided, on the modern understanding of karma, eudaemonism is
> false. (139)

But for Śāntideva, I would argue, this too is not the case. For him, the
kind of external goods that the perpetrator could secure (especially
material goods and social status) are irrelevant at best to the
perpetrator’s well-being; their effect may well be negative. It is
important here that, [as Barbra Clayton
notes](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Theory-Santidevas-Siksasamuccaya-Cultivating/dp/0415599350)
and as we already saw [last
time](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/11/santideva-vs-singer/),
Śāntideva at times uses the term *śubha* (well-being) interchangeably
with *puṇya* (good karma) – which he also uses interchangeably with
*śīla* (good conduct). When he uses a term translatable as “well-being”,
moreover, *śubha* comes up more often than *hita* (the term that Charles
treats as equivalent to “well-being” on page lii of his translation).
Śāntideva’s choices of terms suggest that for him virtue and well-being
are indeed equivalent.

Now what does this equivalence imply? Charles and I agree that the Greek
and Roman Stoics regarded “only virtue as valuable” (137). I have argued
at length in my
[dissertation](http://loveofallwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/lele-dissertation.pdf)
that Śāntideva takes the same position, treating what the Stoics call
“external goods” as neutral or even negative for our well-being. Charles
casually dismisses the Stoic view on Martha Nussbaum’s grounds that it

> seems to undermine the content of any plausible account of the virtues
> themselves. If physical injury, degradation, and misery are not bad
> for people, then why should it be any part of virtue to refrain from
> inflicting them on others? And if those who suffer these alterations
> of fortune at the hands of others have not been harmed, then what can
> justify setting up elaborate social institutions to prevent them, or
> participating in the functioning of those institutions? The view that
> assigns value to nothing but virtue seems to drain all content out of
> both our ethical and our political theories, leaving nothing but a
> sterile form behind. (138-9)

The problem for Charles’s view is that this so-called “sterile form” is
*exactly what Śāntideva advocates*. In this respect I humbly request
that Charles reread my
[dissertation](http://loveofallwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/lele-dissertation.pdf),
especially chapter 7, where I explain at considerable length how
Śāntideva would respond to these exact objections in the exact form that
Nussbaum makes them. The short version: Śāntideva, to put it bluntly,
does not give a crap about social institutions – except for the
monkhood, whose point is to teach virtue rather than to do anything
about alterations of fortune. One *does* still individually prevent
others’ wrongdoing, *for the wrongdoer’s own sake* (see chapter 5 of the
dissertation); and similarly one gives generously, to poor and rich
alike, in order to prepare them to listen to one’s own teaching (see my
[2013 JBE article](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/18054)). But physical
injury and degradation are not problems in themselves; if we understand
them properly, they are opportunities for us to practice our own patient
endurance. Śāntideva claims the developed bodhisattva can even enjoy
being tortured (ŚS 181) – a claim given some empirical plausibility by
the case of [Thich Quang
Duc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c).
Non-bodhisattvas, to be sure, are not at that level *yet* – but getting
them there is our goal, and likely our *only* goal. We might protect
them from injury or degradation in the short run, to make sure they are
well prepared to listen to our teaching –but those injuries and
degradations are not bads in themselves.

What all this means for Charles’s argument is that a naturalized
understanding of karma does *not* render Śāntideva’s eudaemonism false.
(It also means that Śāntideva indeed *is* a eudaimonist, in the sense
Charles describes on p137: that he will “assert a very tight connection
between virtuous action, on the one hand, and the well-being of the
agent, on the other.”) For Śāntideva, as for the Stoics, virtue and
well-being coincide when properly understood – and *not* primarily
because that virtue comes to ripen karmically as external goods. Indeed
Śāntideva spends considerable time advising us to get *rid* of the
karmic fruits of our good actions, because enjoying them is likely to
*interfere* with our genuine well-being.

There *is* a place where naturalized karma can become genuinely
problematic for a view like Śāntideva’s – and that is [the suicide
objection](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/09/in-defence-of-buddhism-without-rebirth/),
which Jan Westerhoff makes in the same volume. If we are not reborn,
then suicide – or even murder – can mark the end of our *duḥkha*.
Śāntideva’s view is uncompromising enough that he could not accept [my
response](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/),
which *does* allow some value to goods other than virtue or liberation.
So if we could establish that humans are not reborn at death, would that
then destroy the bodhisattva path? I do see one other, more Śāntidevan
path (taken by Jim Wilton in [his comment on the suicide
discussion](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/comment-page-1/#comment-40360)),
which is to argue that the bodhisattva’s life is so joyful that it is
*better* than simple extinction. Śāntideva has various characterizations
of the highly advanced bodhisattva – some suggest a painful compassion,
some suggest no emotions or thoughts at all – but there are enough
passages describing the bodhisattva’s happiness, even through
excruciating external conditions, to suggest that he thinks that state
considerably better for the agent than simple extinction.
