Nalanda dialogue: dates rescheduled

Readers will remember the “Walking down the footsteps of the Buddha”,
for which we published an invitation by Debajyoti Gangopadhyay
[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/09/20/walking-down-the-footsteps-of-the-buddha-an-invitation-by-debajyoti-gangopadhyay/).
Now Debajyoti informed me that due to circumstances beyond his control
the dates have been shifted to **16th to 18th of February 2018**.
