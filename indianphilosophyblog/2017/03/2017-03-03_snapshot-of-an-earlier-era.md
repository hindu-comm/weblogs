Snapshot of an earlier era

A couple of years ago, I was walking through a library when I noticed a
Festschrift for Eliot Deutsch called *[The Aesthetic
Turn](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Aesthetic_Turn.html?id=d8Bqk-a_k-wC)*,
edited by Roger Ames. Amesâ€™ short introduction tells the history of the
early East West conferences at Hawaii and some of the pioneering
comparative philosophers that paved the way for us. I procured the book
and made a PDF of the introduction, and attached it here for those who
are curious. While we all know about the Matilals, Potters, and
Mohantys, this takes us back a further generation to the work of other
pioneers.

EDIT: I just noticed that a page is out of order. Please swap the 3rd
and 4th pages of the PDF for it to make sense. Apologies.
