Wolfson College, a postgraduate college of the University of Oxford,
proposes to appoint a stipendiary Research Fellow in Comparative
Philosophy.

Wolfson College is a postgraduate college of the University of Oxford,
with members from over 80 nationalities. The Berggruen Institute has
created a Philosophy and Culture Centre involving comparative and
interdisciplinary study of philosophy and culture with a particular
focus on Eastern and Western traditions. At Wolfson it must draw on
Indian Philosophy, including Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina, or Muslim
Philosophy. It provides Fellowships, one already at Wolfson, intended to
facilitate insights to inform and influence dialogue on matters of
contemporary importance by drawing on Eastern and Western philosophical
traditions. The College’s first Berggruen Research Fellow joined us in
October 2016 and we now propose to appoint a second Research Fellow.

The Berggruen Research Fellow at Wolfson must be an innovative thinker
engaged in work in Wolfson across cultures and disciplines. They should
be working in one of the areas designated in the Berggruen Institute’s
description of its Fellowship Theme.

Current Research Theme: Great Transformations  
Please see the Further Particulars for details of the Great
Transformations theme. In brief summary, for 2017-18, projects are
sought especially on:

1.  The ways artificial intelligence, bioengineering and other
    technologies can potentially transform society and human life
    itself.
2.  Crises of legitimacy in politics and social institutions.
3.  Transformation of capitalism and geopolitics.
4.  Cultural innovation and attempts to resist it.

Main tasks of the post:  
• Fellows will pursue individual and collaborative projects that can
advance Berggruen’s Great Transformations agenda.  
• They will have time for their personal work, but also opportunities to
form collegial relations at their host institutions and with other
Berggruen Fellows.  
• Fellows will be encouraged to publish work based on their own research
in book or article form (or where appropriate in other media).  
• They will also be asked to write occasionally for broader readership
(and/or to appear in video interviews or podcasts).  
• All Berggruen Fellows globally will come together for a conference in
late 2017.

Qualifications and experience required:  
• Must be an innovative thinker.  
• Must hold a doctorate in philosophy and have sufficient postdoctoral
experience for substantial research on the project.  
• Must be engaged in work across cultures and disciplines.  
• Must have the languages and the philosophy needed for their subject.

The Fellowship will be for two years, to commence on 1 October 2017. The
person elected will be based in Oxford and will carry out research and
publish in the above field (and others if desired).

The annual stipend will be £33,000, plus any general percentage increase
in salaries that may come into effect. These Fellowships carry Common
Table rights (currently up to £43 a week for own meals in Hall). Fellows
are entitled to apply for College accommodation at the College rates.  
The full job description and selection criteria should be consulted
before submitting an application.
