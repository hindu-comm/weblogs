Contemporary Indian philosophy and its fortunes and misfortunes in European and Angloamerican journals UPDATED!

A colleague alertedus to a series of posts by (or about) the
philosophers and historian of philosophy Joel Katzav on various aspects
of the intersection of politics and philosophy and its impact on the
fortunes of (especially contemporary) Indian philosophy.

The first one
([here](http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2017/01/the-disappearance-of-modern-indian-philosophy-from-mind-and-the-philosophical-review.html))
starts with a summary of Sharad Deshpande’s distinction between a first
and a second generation of contemporary Indian philosophers and notes
that —contrary to what one might think— contemporary Indian philosophers
managed to publish on the prominent European and Anglo-American
philosophy journals much more often in the past (roughly upto WW2) than
now (!).

The second
[article](http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2017/02/modern-indian-philosophy-in-the-journal-of-philosophy-appearance-and-disappearance-guest-post-by-joe.html)
argues that this disappearance might be due to the fact that these
journals (i.e., *Mind*, *The Philosophical Review* and *The Journal of
Philosophy*) have been taken over by Analytic philosophers. The
conclusion is worth quoting in full:

> Thus, in addition to being characterized by its use of marginalization
> as a way of gaining advantage over other approaches to philosophy,
> 1950s and 1960s analytic philosophy was characterized by its
> persistent silence about how it went about its business.

The third
[article](http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2017/02/modern-indian-philosophy-institutions-and-western-ties-guest-post-by-joel-katzav.html)
starts by reassessing the parallel absence of Indian philosophy and of
all non-Analytic philosophy in the same journals. It then discusses the
institutional ties through which Indian philosophy could nonetheless
thrive in the 1950s to 1970s.

The fourth
[post](http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2017/02/katzav-and-the-indians-guest-post-by-mohan-matthen.html)
is the only one not by but about Joel Katzav, and it is written by Mohan
Matthen. It offers a counter-narrative about the absence of Indian
philosophy from the top European and Anglo-American journals. Let me
quote its main thesis:

> Indians didn’t generally feel intellectually equal to white people,
> and they didn’t have the resources to compete. Some isolated figures
> had the confidence and courage to produce work that could be
> internationally published \[EF: these are the ones who manages to
> publish on top journals prior to WW2\]. But they and their successors
> did not have the connections to the mid-century ferment to enable them
> to continue to sneak into these venues.

Joel Katzav answers to Matthen in the comment section to the post (which
contains, by the way, further interesting comments).

**What do readers, especially those more well-versed in contemporary
Indian philosophy, think?**

UPDATE: I could fix two inaccuracies thanks to Joel Katzav.
