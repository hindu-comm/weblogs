Query on online courses of Sanskrit

A reader asks:

> I am learning Sanskrit and would appreciate any suggestions for an
> English-language, classroom-style “online” or “distance learning”
> intermediate class.  
> I have begun with Nikhil Gandhi (Maurer’s book) and plan to continue
> with an online class at the Australian National University; but am
> looking for a backup plan.  
> “Samskrtam Bharati” is not of interest nor any of the workshop-based
> trainings in the USA.

After a rapid consultation among members of the blog, Matthew Dasti
suggested the Online course on “Introductory Sanskrit” by Antonia Ruppel
(author of the recent *The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit*), but as
far as I can tell this is more of a self-help group insofar as one reads
a chapter of the book each week, gets a key for the exercises and can
ask questions on a facebook
[group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/CambridgeIntroToSanskrit/) and
gets answers from the other members of the group or from the instructor.
Again, unless I misunderstood, there is no frontal teaching. Moreover,
it is certainly for beginners only.

Personally, I usually suggest to interested people who cannot attend a
university course to learn Sanskrit through skype meetings with a
private instructor (they are not very expensive and I can provide you
with some names if you want me to).

**Do readers know of further online courses of Sanskrit?**
