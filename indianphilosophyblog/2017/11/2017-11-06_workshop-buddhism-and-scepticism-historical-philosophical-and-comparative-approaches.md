Workshop: Buddhism and Scepticism: Historical, Philosophical, and Comparative Approaches

I am excited to be taking part in the following workshop next week in
Hamburg. If I have time, maybe I’ll write a blog post about how it
goes, so stay tuned for that. In the meantime, here is the information.

**Buddhism and Scepticism: Historical, Philosophical, and Comparative
Approaches**

Date  
November 14-16, 2017

Convenor  
Oren Hanner (MCAS), in cooperation with the Numata Center for Buddhist
Studies, Universität Hamburg

Abstract  
From their earliest stages, Buddhist traditions have displayed a
sceptical attitude towards various types of accepted knowledge. Buddhist
thinkers, beginning from the historical Buddha, questioned metaphysical
assumptions, the realistic view of the world, and the reliability of our
sources of knowledge, and expressed doubt about common social norms and
religious views. In this way, philosophical scepticism played a pivotal
role in the way Buddhist thought evolved. It served both as a method for
arriving at a reliable and liberating understanding of reality and, as
some argue, as an aspect of spiritual practice.  
The conference on Buddhism and Scepticism investigates the place of
scepticism in the development of classical Buddhist thought from
historical and philosophical perspectives. From a historical standpoint,
the conference explores the development of sceptical strategies in
Buddhism and their relation to non-Buddhist systems of thought in Europe
and Asia. From a philosophical point of view, it explores the ways in
which sceptical arguments are used in Buddhist philosophical works, and
how they resemble, and differ from, sceptical methods in other,
non-Buddhist philosophies.
