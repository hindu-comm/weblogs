Announcement: The Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy

Exciting news: the Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy, edited by
Jonardon Ganeri, has been published by OUP.From the publisher:

> The*Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy*tells the story of
> philosophy in India through a series of exceptional individual acts of
> philosophical virtuosity. It brings together forty leading
> international scholars to record the diverse figures, movements, and
> approaches that constitute philosophy in the geographical region of
> the Indian subcontinent, a region sometimes nowadays designated South
> Asia. The volume aims to be ecumenical, drawing from different
> locales, languages, and literary cultures, inclusive of dissenters,
> heretics and sceptics, of philosophical ideas in thinkers not
> themselves primarily philosophers, and reflecting Indiaâ€™s
> north-western borders with the Persianate and Arabic worlds, its
> north-eastern boundaries with Tibet, Nepal, Ladakh and China, as well
> as the southern and eastern shores that afford maritime links with the
> lands of Theravda Buddhism. Indian Philosophy has been written in many
> languages, including Pali, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Malayalam, Urdu,
> Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Persian, Kannada, Punjabi,
> Hindi, Tibetan, Arabic and Assamese. From the time of the British
> colonial occupation, it has also been written in English. It spans
> philosophy of law, logic, politics, environment and society, but is
> most strongly associated with wide-ranging discussions in the
> philosophy of mind and language, epistemology and metaphysics (how we
> know and what is there to be known), ethics, metaethics and
> aesthetics, and metaphilosophy. The reach of Indian ideas has been
> vast, both historically and geographically, and it has been and
> continues to be a major influence in world philosophy. In the breadth
> as well as the depth of its philosophical investigation, in the sheer
> bulk of surviving texts and in the diffusion of its ideas, the
> philosophical heritage of India easily stands comparison with that of
> China, Greece, the Latin west, or the Islamic world.

A number of the Indian Philosohy Blog contributors have been a part of
this project, as well.
