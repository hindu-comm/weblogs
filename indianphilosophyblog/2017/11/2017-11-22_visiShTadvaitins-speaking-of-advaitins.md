Viśiṣṭādvaitins speaking of Advaitins

The following passage is from Yāmuna’s Ātmasiddhi and it is a
description of the Advaita position about the brahman as being
tantamount to consciousness:

> ato ‘syā na meyaḥ kaścid api dharmo ‘sti. ato
> nirdhūtanikhilabhedavikalpanirdharmaprakāśamātraikarasā kūṭasthanityā
> saṃvid evātmā paramātmā ca. yathāha yānubhūtir ajāmeyānantātmā iti.
> saiva ca vedāntavākyatātparyabhūmir iti (ĀS, pp. 29–30 of the 1942
> edition)
>
> Therefore this (consciousness) has no characteristic as its knowable
> content. Therefore, this very consciousness is eternal, uniform and it
> consists of light-only, without characteristics, in which all
> conceptualisations of difference have been dissolved. This
> consciousness alone is the self (ultimately identical with the single
> brahman, but illusory identified as one’s own self) and the supreme
> self (i.e., the brahman). As it has been said: ”That experience (i.e.,
> consciousness) is unborn, cannot become a knowledge content, it is
> endless, it is the self”\*. And this alone is the ultimate meaning
> (tātparya) of the Upaniṣads’ sentences.

The quote within the passage (yānubhūtir ajāmeyānantātmā) could be an
Upaniṣadic quote, but I could not locate it. **Do readers know it?**
And, more importantly: Yāmuna’s description seems fair to me. **Do
readers more expert in Advaita agree?**
