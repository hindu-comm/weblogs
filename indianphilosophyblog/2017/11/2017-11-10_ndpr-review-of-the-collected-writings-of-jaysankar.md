NDPR review of The Collected Writings of Jaysankar Lal Shaw: Indian Analytic and Anglophone Philosophy

[J. L. Shaw](https://vimeo.com/103757970) is an important figure in the
contemporarymovement to understand India’s*śāstric*traditions through
analytic philosophy. Unfortunately (like other figures, including Kishor
Chakrabarti), his influence issometimes underappreciated given the
preeminence of Matilal, Mohanty, Potter, and their followers. It is
refreshing to see that NDPR recognizedthe worthiness of this volume.
