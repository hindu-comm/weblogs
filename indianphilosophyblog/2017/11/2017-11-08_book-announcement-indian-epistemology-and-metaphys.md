Book Announcement–Indian Epistemology and Metaphysics (Bloomsbury), ed. Joerg Tuske



From the publisher (Bloomsbury):

> 
>
> *Indian Epistemology and Metaphysics*introduces the reader to new
> perspectives on Indian philosophy based on philological research
> within the last twenty years.Concentrating on topics such as
> perception, inference, skepticism, consciousness, self, mind, and
> universals, some of the most notable scholars working in classical
> Indian philosophy today examine core epistemological and metaphysical
> issues. Philosophical theories and arguments from a comprehensive
> range of Indian philosophical traditions (including the Nyaya,
> Mimamsa, Saiva, Vedanta, Samkhya, Jain, Buddhist, materialist and
> skeptical traditions, as well as some 20th century thought) are
> covered. The contributors to this volume approach the topics from both
> a philosophical and a philological perspective. They demonstrate the
> importance of the subject matter for an understanding of Indian
> thought in general and they highlight its wider philosophical
> significance.By developing an appreciation of classical Indian
> philosophy in its own terms, set against the background of its unique
> assumptions and historical and cultural development,*Indian
> Epistemology and Metaphysics*is an invaluable guide to the current
> state of scholarship on Indian philosophy. It is a timely and
> much-needed reference resource, the first of its kind.

For those concerned with the price, in conversation, Joerg has noted
that a paperback edition should be in the works.
