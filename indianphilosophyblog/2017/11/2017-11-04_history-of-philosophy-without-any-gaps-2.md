History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps

Peter Adamason’s podcast series, [History of Philosophy Without Any
Gaps](https://historyofphilosophy.net/)has been developing a subsection
on [Indian philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/india) for the
last year and a half or so. It is worth looking at. Consider, for
example,[this
episode](https://historyofphilosophy.net/mimamsa-freschi), where our own
Elisa Freschi talks aboutMīmāṃsā. If one looks at recent episodes on
the website, the Indian subsection seems to be a major emphasis of late.
