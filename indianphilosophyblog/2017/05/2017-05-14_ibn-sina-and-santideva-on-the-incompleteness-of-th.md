ibn Sīnā and Śāntideva on the incompleteness of the world

[Cross-posted at Love of All Wisdom.](http://wp.me/pxfBj-11L)

I’ve been thinking lately about [MacIntyre’s explanation of the Muslim
philosopher ibn
Sīnā](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2014/11/intermediate-ascents/) and
the ways in which ibn Sīnā’s concept of God requires us to rethink the
entire world around us if we accept it:

> From \[atheists’\] standpoint a theist is someone who believes in just
> one more being than they do and who therefore has the responsibility
> for justifying her or his belief in this extra entity. But from the
> standpoint of the theist this is already to have misconceived both God
> and theistic belief in God. To believe in God is not to believe that
> in addition to nature, about which atheists and theists can agree,
> there is something else, about which they disagree. It is rather that
> theists and atheists disagree about nature as well as about God. For
> theists believe that nature presents itself as radically incomplete,
> as requiring a ground beyond itself, if it is to be intelligible, and
> so their disagreement with atheists involves *everything.* (*God,
> Philosophy, Universities* p. 47)

What’s drawing my attention is that you could write a very similar
passage to characterize *Buddhism*. Specifically, something like this
could well be said about the non-self (anattā/anātman) doctrine, which
Buddhist logicians like
[Dharmakīrti](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dharmakiirti/) took to
be the central doctrine they needed to justify. A Buddhist version of
the passage, which took non-self as the primary Buddhist metaphysical
doctrine, would be almost a mirror image of the original:

> From non-Buddhists’ standpoint a Buddhist is someone who believes in
> just one fewer class of being than they do and who therefore may have
> the responsibility for justifying her or his lack of belief in this
> class of being. But from the standpoint of the Buddhist this is
> already to have misconceived both the nonexistence of self and
> Buddhist lack of belief in the self. To believe in non-self is not to
> believe that in addition to the rest of nature, about which Buddhists
> and non-Buddhists can agree, there is one further class of entity, the
> self, about which they disagree. It is rather that Buddhists and
> non-Buddhists disagree about all of nature. For Buddhists believe that
> nature presents itself as radically incomplete if it is to be
> intelligible, and so their disagreement with non-Buddhists involves
> *everything.*

Such a paragraph, I think, fairly describes both [Śāntideva’s
metaphysical and ethical
views](http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2015/07/16/the-metaphysical-basis-of-santidevas-ethics/)
and those of other (non-Mahāyāna) Buddhist writers, like Aśvaghoṣa in
his [Buddhacarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhacarita). The main
inaccuracy in it would be the presentation of “nature”, for Buddhists
rarely identify one unified singular entity that could be referred to
collectively as “nature”. In this they are quite unlike their [Sāṃkhya
and Yoga](http://www.iep.utm.edu/sankhya/) opponents, who identify
everything other than the self (*puruṣa*) as a singular entity called
*prakṛti*. By contrast, in mainstream and Madhyamaka Buddhist thought,
worldly phenomena are typically plural, with no unity – referred to as
“compounded things” (*saṃskṛta dharma*s) or “aggregates” (*skandha*s).
But – this is key – all of those things are indeed taken to be radically
incomplete, lacking. They are fundamentally characterized by their
impermanence (*anitya*), their status as suffering or unsatisfactoriness
(*duḥkha*) – and their being *anātman*. For human beings to be *anātman*
means they have no self – but for other phenomena, it may be best
understood that they have no essence, no nature. As
[Nāgārjuna](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nagarjun/) would put it, they have no
*svabhāva*, no “own-being”.

Buddhists and Muslims then share a view that there is something
radically incomplete about the manifold things around us as they present
themselves to us, and to understand those things we need to understand
that incompleteness. The difference is that for Muslims like ibn Sīnā,
they can be completed by the ultimate referent and essence that
underlies them, which is God. For Buddhists, however, there is no such
ultimate referent, no ultimate completeness. Rather, it is the
incompleteness itself that is ultimate; to reach a satisfactory state
beyond suffering or disappointment, we must transcend all of those
things (including our own selves) that have impermanence and
disappointment as their nature. [Aśvaghoṣa’s
Buddhacarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhacarita) is a powerful
exposition of this view, showing in lyrical and evocative Sanskrit
poetry how the Buddha-to-be came to his vision by seeing how the
phenomena of the world are always impermanent and subject to decay, and
that no form of life dependent on them could be ultimately satisfactory.

I find this point gives me a firmer grasp on the four ethically
significant metaphysical claims in [my previous
article]((http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2015/07/16/the-metaphysical-basis-of-santidevas-ethics/)).
I had identified four metaphysical claims of Śāntideva’s that each
underlie an ethical claim, but hadn’t adequately described the
connections *between* those metaphysical claims. They are all claims
about the essencelessness, the incompleteness, of various kinds of
phenomena. If you see things as truly having no “self”, you will see the
idea of a [decision-making
agent](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/01/on-the-very-idea-of-buddhist-ethics/)
as reducible to causal conditions, and therefore avoid blaming others;
you will [see sexually attractive
bodies](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/09/reading-the-deconstruction-of-the-body/)
not as whole bodies but as the fluids that make them up; you will see
yourself not as a person to be prioritized but as a collection of
[free-floating
dukkha](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2011/03/of-anatman-and-altruism/);
and you will see all things as without essence and therefore unworthy of
attachment. Or so Śāntideva claims.

And so Śāntideva’s non-self, like ibn Sīnā’s God, goes very deep down.
It is not merely one entity subtracted or added to the other entities in
the world; it requires us to understand all those others differently,
and indeed to act differently if we see correctly. So metaphysical
debates about God and the self are not merely the frivolous quibblings
of pedantic
[Aspergians](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/aspergers-syndrome-in-the-history-of-philosophy/);
their results have fundamental consequences for the way we understand
the entire world.
