New Resource: The Deviant Philosopher

Thereâ€™s a new resource for philosophy teachers called[*The Deviant
Philosopher*.](http://thedeviantphilosopher.org) The site is developed
by a team from the University of Oklahoma, which includes Amy Olberding,
Wayne Riggs, Kelly Epley, and Seth Robertson. From the site:

> *The Deviant Philosopher*is a teaching resource created by a group of
> scholars who believe that there is value in deviating from the
> traditional Anglo-American philosophical canon. Both we and our
> students benefit from thinking about diverse philosophical traditions
> and perspectives, and there are many non-canonical philosophical ideas
> that are rich with philosophical interest and can enhance our
> understanding of a variety of philosophical issues and topics.

This is a great resource for blog readers looking to branch out from
Indian philosophy or looking for ideas for ways to incorporate Indian
philosophy into general topics courses.

I would also recommend that blog readers with experience teaching Indian
philosophy think about submitting a lesson, primer, or exercise to the
site. Read [the Submission Guidelines
here.](http://thedeviantphilosopher.org/submissions/SubmissionGuidelines)

I submitted [a unit on theism and atheism in classical Indian
philosophy](http://thedeviantphilosopher.org/Units/TheismAndAtheismInClassicalIndianPhilosophy)
that would be suitable for inclusion in a general philosophy of religion
course. In fact, I have included just such a unit in my philosophy of
religion course with great success.

I can report that the writing and submission process went smoothly for
me, so I wholeheartedly recommend submitting something.
