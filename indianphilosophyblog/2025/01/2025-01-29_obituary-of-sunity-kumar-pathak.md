APA panel on the IPh blog

*Guest post submitted by Debajyoti Gangopadhyay*

Classical Indian Buddhism scholar Suniti Kumar Pathak passed away recently in his Santiniketan house, Bengal. For the whole Indian Buddhist fraternity as well as Indo-Tibetan academia this loss is irreparable. He was 101 years old, which was really a number for him as he was mentally alert till his last day and continued writing through dictation! His life was truly an instance of worship of *Prajnaparamita*.

Apart from our personal loss, Nalanda Dialogue mission lost its mentor – the transdisciplinary mission which started nearly two decades back under his active patronage centering Navanalanda Mahavihara, Nalanda.

Though he was an ardent follower of the Buddha’s teachings, he can’t be described as a Buddhist in any parochial sense of the word. As a polyglot he extended his interest to almost all traditional Indian Vidyas written in classical languages like Pali, Prakrit, and Sanskrit as well as those translated in Tibetan and Chinese. He wrote extensively on Buddhist Tantra and Dharmashastra. He has completed the unfinished work of Pundit Rahul Sankrityayan, *Tibetan-Hindi Lexicon*, published in two volumes.

He took the parental initiative to start Nalanda Dialogue Mission nearly 20 years back with a few of us which later flourished literally as the only platform in this country for promoting *Science Philosophy Dialogue* in its modern form.

In fact, the questions we all in this subcontinent were subjected to address long back during the beginning of the colonial period here was about the question of working out the modes of our proper responsive engagement to the Western knowledge system we started receiving that time! It was the biggest issue which is well known to have shaped further our subsequent academic as well as social fate. But Indian academia is still very much in the process of response to this question which still awaits a proper integrative settlement of the *best of* East and West!

Acharya Pathak was truly and prophetically a seeker of answer to this colonial question from his own Buddhist perspective, and in that way he inspired a generation to seek the same. His primal initiative in establishing a new *Buddhism-Science dialogue* in Nalanda was a consequence of this attempt.

A true tribute to him would be to shape our future academia relentlessly on the basis of transdisciplinary dialogue with a spirit nurtured once in Nalanda.
