Job opening at Ghent on Comparative Philosophy

Celebrating [ten years of the IPB](https://indianphilosophyblog.org/2024/01/02/the-indian-philosophy-blog-is-10/), we are going to be hosting a panel at the [Eastern Division Meeting of the American Philosophical Association](https://www.apaonline.org/BlankCustom.asp?page=2025eastern) in New York City on Thursday, 9 January 2025, entitled **Building a Network of Scholars in Indian Philosophy: The Indian Philosophy Blog and Beyond**. All three editors of the IPB (Ethan Mills, Elisa Freschi and myself) will be participating, with Ethan moderating the discussion. We’ll have a first session from 11am-12:50pm and continue from 2pm-3:50pm after a lunch break. The intent is for the panelists’ presentations to stimulate an open discussion about building community among scholars of Indian philosophy. The panelists and their presentations will be:

-   **Ethan Mills** (University of Tennessee – Chattanooga): Chair
-   **Elisa Freschi** (University of Toronto): “Can and Should We Build
    a Community of Scholars Working on Sanskrit Philosophy?”
-   **Monika Kirloskar-Steinbach** (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam):
    “Indian Philosophy Today”
-   **Amod Lele** (Northeastern University): “Reflections on Ten Years
    of the Indian Philosophy Blog”
-   **Parimal Patil** (Harvard University): “Philosophers, Sanskritists,
    and Sanskrit Philosophy”
-   **Chris Rahlwes** (Smith College): “Elucidating Indian Philosophy
    through Jain Studies”

If you’re going to be at the Eastern APA, we’d love to see you there!
