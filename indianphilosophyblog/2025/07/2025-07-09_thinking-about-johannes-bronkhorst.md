On sacrificial violence

On May 15, Harry Falk announced on the Indology mailing list that Johannes Bronkhorst had “left this world”. In the following weeks the mailing list (and, I am sure, other online forums) has been virtually monopolised by people remembering the man and his endless contributions to Sanskrit studies and connected fields. In fact, Johannes has been extremely prolific (*Greater Magadha* was written in just one semester!) and his contributions have been impactful with almost no comparison.

He had studied first mathematics and physics and then moved to studying Sanskrit in India, Pune. In a recent interview with Vincent Eltschinger (on April 21 2025) he commented the choice to travel to India as due to his desire not to serve as a soldier —a choice which was deeply important to him. But, whatever the initial motivation, his years-long stay in India was meaningful and influential for his life and he never grew out of his fascination for Indian thought.

The fact that he started studying Sanskrit while in India is key to understand the role of Vyākaraṇa in his first many decades of work, given that Vyākaraṇa (or Sanskrit linguistics) is still studied and lively engaged with in contemporary India in general and in Pune in particular. Vyākaraṇa demands deep and almost complete dedication because of its technical character. One needs to know by heart or at least to be able to navigate all the 4000 aphorisms of Pāṇini’s seminal work for the school, together with their punctual glosses by Kātyāyana and the commentary by Patañjali, and this before even being able to open one’s mouth in a symposium of Vaiyākaraṇas. Bronkhorst has been able to contribute to this very technical field, especially to its perhaps most original thinker, Bhartṛhari, but without being swallowed up by the labyrinth of Vyākaraṇa. In contrast, he learnt from its method and contents, but retained his untameable intellectual curiosity.

For scholars of Bhartṛhari, Bronkhorst’s articles are indispensable. But even the ones among of us who never specialised on Bhartṛhari have probably been influenced by Bronkhorst and by his unique blend of thought-provoking ideas and thorough knowledge of the sources. In fact, Bronkhorst was an avid and fast reader, who read hundreds of pages of both Sanskrit scholarship and contemporary, mainly scientific, papers. His ideas looked at first sight almost too thought-provoking, almost like balons d’essay (trial balloons). However, when one tried to refute them, one was forced to see that Bronkhorst knew the Sanskrit sources of the relevant period thoroughly and that his bold ideas were in fact also well-grounded. (Apologies for not discussing here whether they were also ultimately right and completely so. I want to focus more on what we can learn from him than on correcting the occasional typos or on disagreeing with specific points.)

For instance, in May 2021 Dominik Wujastyk organised a (virtual) conference on the topic of Johannes Bronkhorst’s *Greater Magadha* (2007), which possibly remains his most influential book. Bronkhorst himself had been invited as a respondent for talks which all engaged with his hypothesis. I was only in the audience, but was astonished to see how, almost twenty years after the book’s composition, Bronkhorst was still able to discuss each of its aspects and to respond (again, I will let to others to assess whether successfully) to each criticism raised by the speakers, through precise references to the epics and/or to Vedic texts.

Let me know enter into some details about a few of Johannes Bronkhorst’s contributions. Again, let me emphasise that there are too many to discuss even a significant percentage of them and that therefore the choice will be partly whimsical. I will focus on

-   a\) The sceptical Johannes Bronkhorst looking at the development of
    Sanskrit philosophy: The *Greater Magadha* hypothesis, the
    “discovery of dialogue” and its significance for the history of
    Sanskrit philosophy
-   b\) The sceptical Johannes Bronkhorst looking at the role of authors
    in Sanskrit philosophy: his hypothesis about a unitary Yogaśāstra
    and dis-unitary Mīmāṃsāsūtra and its importance for how we assess
    Sanskrit aphoristic texts
-   c\) His hypothesis about a radical difference between Sanskrit
    thought and European thought
-   d\) His general sceptical-scientific methodology

&nbsp;

-   a\) *Greater Magadha* is one of those books about which we remember
    a moment before and a moment after. Before the book, scholars and
    lay people alike took it for granted that there was a single line of
    development within Indian though and that since the Buddha and his
    thought postdated early Vedic texts by centuries, these needed to
    contain the seeds which would have later led to the development of
    Buddhist thought. The texts which were conceptually closer to
    ancient Buddhism, namely the Upaniṣads were therefore dated to
    before the Buddha.

    The *Greater Magadha* takes the opposite point of view and looks at
    the evidence available with fresh eyes and notices that they are
    less uniform than we might think. They thus point to a different
    line of development, one in which there were different roots for
    Indian culture, which developed in parallel and not just a single
    line. On the West, the brāhmaṇic culture produced the Vedic texts.
    On the East of the Indian subcontinent, around Magadha, the culture
    he provisionally called “śramaṇic” produced Jainism and Buddhism, as
    well as key ideas that were later absorbed in the Brahmanic fold,
    such as karman and rebirth. By the way, the presence of an Eastern
    border for the Brahmanical culture is also attested by Patañjali’s
    definition of Āryavarta, which has an Eastern boundary (unlike
    Manu’s description of the same, only a few centuries later).

    The *Greater Magadha* can explain why karman and rebirth make a
    sudden entry in the Upaniṣads although they are virtually absent
    from the preceding Vedic texts. They enter the Brahmanical culture
    so well-developed and all at once because they had been elaborated
    for centuries outside of the Brahmanical culture. If Bronkhorst is
    right, one can stop looking for faint traces of possible forerunners
    of karman and rebirth in the Vedic Saṃhitās and start focusing on
    how the theory was already developed in Buddhist texts and then
    imported into the Upaniṣads. One can also invert the chronology of
    the Upaniṣads, which post-date the encounter with śramaṇic culture
    (this does not mean that they need to postdate the life of
    Siddhartha Gautama, since he was only one exponent of that culture,
    as is clear through the parallel of Jainism). The same applies to
    the claim that “Yoga” was practiced by the Buddha. In contrast, the
    similarities between the PYŚ and the Buddha’s teachings should be.
    according to Bronkhorst, interpreted as an influence of Buddhism
    into Yoga.

    Although I am here mainly focusing on philosophical issues, let me
    emphasise again that Bronkhorst’s reconstruction is extremely
    detailed and covers also aspects like the different funerary
    practices (round stūpas in the East vs. quadrilateral moulds in the
    West), the approach to medicine and the conception of a cyclical
    time, as well as the opposition between a urban (Magadha) and rural
    (brahmanical) culture. Last, it has the advantage of providing a
    methodology to identify what is original in the teaching of the
    Buddha and to explain why asceticism is both endorsed in the Pāli
    canon and criticised by the Buddha (it was part of his cultural
    milieu).

-   a2) Distinguishing communities and not looking for historical links
    when they are virtually absent was at the basis of another of
    Bronkhorst’s contributions, namely the idea that the roots of Indian
    dialectics should be placed in the Buddhist communities in the
    northwest of the Indian subcontinent (which might have been
    influenced by the Greek tradition of public debate in the
    Indo-Bactrian kingdoms) and that it was useless to consider
    Upaniṣadic dialogues as the forerunners of the dialectical
    engagements which became standard in Sanskrit philosophy. Upaniṣadic
    dialogues are just something different (closer to the instruction by
    a wise person).

-   b\) Bronkhorst was (to my knowledge, as always) the first one to
    propose the idea of a unitary composition for what is known as the
    *Yogasūtra* and the *Yogabhāṣya* He spoke accordingly of a unitary
    Yogaśāstra. Like in the previous case, the idea is mind-blowing. Up
    to that point, many scholars had tried to reconstruct the worldview
    of the *Yogasūtra* as divided from the *Yogabhāṣya* and the Sāṅkhya
    intervention of the latter. If Bronkhorst’s hypothesis is correct,
    by contrast, the division into sūtra ‘aphorism’ and bhāṣya
    ‘commentary’ is only a polarity within a single text. This explains
    what could have otherwise been considered an anomaly, like the
    complete absence of an autonomous transmission of the *Yogasūtra*.
    Like in the Greater Magadha case, one could find alternative
    explanations, but Bronkhorst’s hypothesis has the advantage of
    showing a possibility for streamlining explanations and avoiding
    unnecessary additional steps (in Sanskrit, one would call that
    *kalpanāgaurava*). I should add in this connection that Bronkhorst’s
    hypothesis was presented in just an article (1985), but has
    thereafter been embraced by Philipp Maas (see especially Maas 2006
    and Maas 2013) who found many evidences corroborating it, from
    manuscripts to the syntax of the sūtra-bhāṣya connecting links.

-   b2) A similar case is that of the relation between the so-called
    Pūrva and Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sūtra, also known as Mīmāṃsā Sūtra and
    Brahma Sūtra. Authors before Bronkhorst had discussed their relation
    and chronology, Bronkhorst (2007) suggested that the latter imitates
    the style of the former, though not emerging from the same
    exegetical milieu.

-   c\) In the occasion of Ernst Steinkellner’s retirement, a symposium
    on the topic “Denkt Asien anders?” (*Does Asia think differently?*)
    was organised. Bronkhorst’s intervention led to a later book chapter
    and finally a book on the topic of what is different in Sanskrit
    thought. Bronkhorst proposed, as usual, a thought-provoking thesis,
    namely that there is indeed a radical difference, namely the
    reliance on language by Sanskrit philosophers.  
    He explained how the various causation theories within Sanskrit
    philosophy (from Vaiśeṣika to Vedānta etc.) and the puzzled they
    involved (such as how could it be possible to bring into existence
    something that previously did not exist) are all due to thinking
    about the problem in linguistic terms. Their answers, in other
    words, were oriented by the Sanskrit form of basic sentences such as
    “the potter makes a pot”. In fact, how can the pot figure as the
    object of a sentence, given that it does not exist yet? Bronkhorst
    thought that this was a linguistic problem, namely one occasioned by
    the structure of language and not an ontological one. Westerners,
    according to Bronkhorst, would have immediately labeled the pot as
    non-existing until it is realised by the potter and would not have
    paused on its ontological status, whereas Indians never
    distinguished between linguistic and external reality.  
      
    This is an interesting insight, and in fact there are several
    elements suggesting (as Karl Potter maintained) that the “linguistic
    turn” occurred in India much earlier than in Europe (note that I am
    saying the same thing Bronkhorst said, but looking at it from a more
    favourable perspective), such as the insistence on the analysis of
    linguistic data in order to solve epistemological or ontological
    issues (cf. the insistence on the linguistic use *śabdaṃ kṛ-* within
    the debate about the ontological status of *śabda*).

-   d\) Bronkhorst was a convinced asserter of the scientific approach.
    This does not mean that he was an a-priori believer in natural
    sciences. Rather, he thought that the scientific method is based on
    a healthy form of scepticism and thus can never lead to fanatical
    beliefs nor to any form of “scientific traditionalism” (if correctly
    applied). For this very reason, he also thought that the scientific
    method was not “Western”, it had proven to work because of its
    ability to ask questions and thus to be universal. He took seriously
    Yoga and meditation techniques and thought that they could be
    analysed with the scientific method and possibly lead to new
    discoveries.

-   d2) Similarly, Bronkhorst clearly looked down on blind believers and
    thus praised Sanskrit philosophers for their ability to distinguish
    myths from arguments. In “What did Indian philosophers
    believe?” (2010) he noted that Sanskrit philosophers did not attack
    each other based on myths (although, one may add, some Buddhist
    philosophers did have fun at criticising some passages of the Veda
    and Kumārila made fun of the walls-speaking argument), but rather
    their arguments (“These philosophers, while criticising each others’
    views, never attacked each others’ myths. Yet these myths would have
    been easy targets, if they had been seriously believed in”). In
    short, the reliance on the scientific method meant a radical
    openness to defeasibility of one’s beliefs and to a data-based
    approach.

Let me add a few words about Johannes Bronkhorst as a human being. The Indology list was full of “Bronkhorst stories” and therefore I will not need to take too much of your time with them (you can read them on the Indology archives). Let me just point out how Bronkhorst was generous and supportive with younger scholars and even students, but in a very unique way. I still remember our first meeting. I was an undergraduate student and he immediately asked me which were my key interests (I was unable to give a specific answer, at that point I was just busy learning Sanskrit and reading as much as possible of any text my professors read). I read or hear similar stories from others, all pointing to how Bronkhorst took people seriously, even young people. He was supportive, but not patronising. He was interested in one’s opinion, but would not refrain from saying that it was wrong if he thought so, according to the scientific method discussed above. He would not mince words to attack a view, but not so when coming to the person holding it, and I have seen him greeting warmly people with whom he had had violent disagreements on specific issues.
