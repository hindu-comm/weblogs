Obituary of Suniti Kumar Pathak

Veṅkaṭanātha has to adapt the Mīmāṃsā approach to free will to his Vaiṣṇava commitment to the role of God’s grace.  
He thus concludes that humans are free in their intentions, although they need God’s consent to convert them into action. Interestingly enough, here he reuses again a Mīmāṃsā technical term, namely *anumati* ‘permission’ to indicate God’s allowing humans to act according to their wishes. This limited range of freedom is still enough for humans to surrender, since surrender (*prapatti*) is primarily an act of will.  
The situation becomes slightly more complicated insofar as in order to surrender one needs to be in the correct state of mind, which includes one’s desperation about one’s ability to ever be able to perform any activity in a correct manner, including making progress in the ritual and the salvific knowledge paths. Thus, one is free to surrender, but genuine surrender can only happen once one is deeply desperate about one’s abilities, so that it seems that the freedom to surrender appears as to one as their last freedom available, their last resort.  
This divide between one’s phenomenological state (and one’s conviction to be utterly unable to undertake anything) and the undeniable reality of one’s freedom to surrender is captured in Veṅkaṭanātha’s commentary on Rāmānuja’s *Śaraṇāgatigadya*. There, Veṅkaṭanātha has to defend the author’s first turning to Lakṣmī before surrendering to God directly.

In other words, in order to surrender, one must be desperate, up to the point of despairing about their possibility to successfully surrender. If one said “I surrender”, while still thinking to be in control one one’s situation, one would not in fact be really surrendering, since surrendering involves giving up the responsibility for one’s salvation (this is technically called *bharanyāsa* ‘giving up the burden’). Thus, surrendering *in order to* reach salvation would be an internal contradiction. Still, one’s ability to independently surrender shows that one was indeed free to surrender.
