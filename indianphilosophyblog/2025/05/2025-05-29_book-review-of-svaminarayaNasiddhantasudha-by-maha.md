The landscape of Indian philosophy continues to evolve with the arrival of a new *vādagrantha*—a philosophical treatise that introduces the positions of a *darśana* and engages it with others that share its domain. As a seminal, contemporary Sanskrit literary work, Mahāmahopādhyāya Bhadreshdas Swami’s *Svāminārāyaṇasiddhāntasudhā* (*Sudhā*) brings a new voice to a timeless discussion. It was recently recognized as the awardee of the prestigious “Saraswati Samman” (2025) for its contribution to Indian literature.

Authored as a systematic exposition of the Akṣara-Puruṣottama Darśana, the distinct philosophical school revealed by Bhagavān Svāminārāyaṇa (1781-1830), the *Sudhā* anchors the Darśana’s principles within the textual authority of the Vedic canon. It is a companion work that elaborates upon the philosophical foundations laid in the author’s monumental *Svāminārāyaṇabhāṣya*—a comprehensive, five-volume Sanskrit commentary on the *Prasthānatrayī*. The text is organized into nine *dhārās* (streams), each exploring facets of the Darśana’s epistemology (*pramāṇa*), metaphysics (*tattvajñāna*), and soteriology (spiritual endeavour (*sādhana*) and the nature of liberation (*phala*)). This review will thematically explore the *Sudhā’s* core philosophical substance, focusing on some of its most significant contributions to Indian thought.

**Foundations of Knowledge**

In epistemology, the *Sudhā* takes a distinct approach to traditional discussions on the nature of knowledge and its sources. Rather than debating the number of sources of knowledge (*pramāṇas*), it embraces an inclusive paradigm and elaborates on the necessary conditions of each source. This allows for the *darśana* to accept perception (*pratyakṣa*), inference (*anumāna*), testimony (*śabda*), analogy (*upamāna*), postulation (*arthāpatti*), and non-apprehension (*anupalabdhi*) as legitimate sources of valid cognition while also accommodating additional sources, including forms of unmediated cognition. Additionally, verbal testimony (*śabda*), covering *śruti*, *smṛti*, and tradition-specific sacred texts like the *Vacanāmṛta* (an anthology of Svāminārāyaṇa’s discourses), receives emphasis as indispensable for trans-empirical knowledge, stressing the crucial role of a qualified teacher (guru) in unlocking scriptural import.

The *Sudhā* also presents its unique position on error (*khyātivāda*), termed *cid-acit-khyāti*. Drawing from Svāminārāyaṇa’s teachings, this account describes errors pertaining to insentient entities (e.g., the misapprehension of nacre for silver) and those relating to the nature and being of conscious ones. The latter includes misperceptions regarding identifying the individual self (*ātman*) with the material world (viz., the body or mind) or imposing human limitations upon divine realities. *Cid-acit-khyāti* aims to provide a comprehensive account of the nature of cognitive error consistent with the Darśana’s core ontological identities while simultaneously refining elements from other traditional theories of error.

**The Structure of Reality: Five Eternal Entities**

Complementing its epistemology is the Darśana’s distinct metaphysical framework. Setting it apart from other Vedānta *darśanas*, the Akṣara-Puruṣottama Darśana advocates five eternally distinct ontological realities: the *jīvas* (the individual self), the *īśvaras* (a class of beings involved in cosmic governance), *māyā* (primordial substance of the cosmos and the cause of ignorance), Akṣarabrahman (also referred to as Akṣara or Brahman), and Parabrahman (the supreme Being, also known as Puruṣottama). By presenting readings from the Prasthānatrayī—the three canonical texts of Vedānta, including the *Upaniṣads*, *Bhagavad Gītā*, and the *Brahmasūtras*—the *Sudhā* argues for the irreducible, eternal difference between these five categories and the nature and form of each.

Among these discussions, the identity of Akṣarabrahman holds a unique and central position. Distinct from the other four entities, Akṣarabrahman is described as ontologically superior to *jīvas*, *īśvaras*, and *māyā*, yet subordinate to Parabrahman. The *Sudhā* draws on readings of seminal scriptural passages, including the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad’s “*akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ*” (2.1.2), conveying Parabrahman as superior to, and hence, distinct from, the superior Akṣara\[brahman\], the *Gītā’s* identification of Puruṣottama as different (“*uttamaḥ puruṣastvanyaḥ*”) from Akṣara, and the *Brahmasūtra’s* first aphorism: “*athāto brahmajijñāsā*” as intending an inquiry into two Brahmans (“*brahmaṇoḥ jijñāsā*”)—Akṣarabrahman and Parabrahman.

The text also presents readings from the Prasthānatrayī to describe Akṣarabrahman as having four forms: (1) the divine, eternal abode (Akṣaradhāman); (2) the ideal, eternal devotee serving Parabrahman within that abode; (3) the all-pervading, conscious reality (*cidākāśa*) supporting creation; and (4) critically, the eternally manifest Akṣarabrahman guru on earth. While detailing Parabrahman’s transcendent and immanent nature, it places particular emphasis on the doctrine of his direct, manifest presence through this lineage of Akṣarabrahman gurus, making the living guru the locus of Parabrahman’s salvific accessibility.

**The Path and Goal: Becoming Brahmarūpa for Offering Parā-Bhakti**

The Darśana’s metaphysical positions shape its vision of spiritual endeavour (*sādhana*) and liberation (*mokṣa*). The path toward the liberated state is termed “Ekāntika Dharma,” an integrated discipline comprising *dharma* (righteous conduct), *jñāna* (spiritual knowledge, centred on realizing the self and understanding the five entities), *vairāgya* (detachment from materiality and its relations), and *bhakti* (devotion to Parabrahman and his manifest form). This approach positions the *darśana* as unique among the other Vedānta *darśanas* while presenting an unprecedented rendering of ‘dharma’.

The *Sudhā* conveys the supreme state as achieving *brahmabhāva* or the *brahmarūpa* state, which it uniquely characterizes as realizing one’s identity as an *ātman* distinct from the mind/body and attaining qualities akin (*guṇasādharmya*) to Akṣarabrahman. Liberation is described as attainable both while living (*jīvanamukti*) and after bodily death (*videhamukti*), involving the *brahmarūpa* self reaching Akṣaradhāman. By correlating readings such as *Gītā’s* “*brahmabhūtaḥ… madbhaktiṃ labhate parām‌*” (18.54), the work presents this attainment as the essential prerequisite for offering supreme, loving devotion (*parābhakti*) to Parabrahman even in the liberated state.

**A Living Voice in Vedānta**

A notable feature assisting the study and transmission of these positions is the *Sudhā’s* inclusion of 539 concise Sanskrit verses (*kārikās*) summarizing its core arguments. These *kārikās* exhibit a sophisticated literary and scriptural dimension, showcasing the author’s poetic prowess alongside their philosophical depth, distinguishing them within the genre. The verses exhibit noteworthy intertextual density, often subtly echoing canonical passages to firmly embed the Darśana’s teachings within the larger Vedic textual tradition.

As a formidable work of contemporary Sanskrit philosophy, the *Sudhā* provides a comprehensive, rigorous, and systematic articulation of the Akṣara-Puruṣottama Darśana, firmly rooting it in Vedāntic discourse while delineating its unique contributions.
