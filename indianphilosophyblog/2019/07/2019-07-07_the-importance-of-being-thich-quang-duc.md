The importance of being Thich Quang Duc

In the [Śikṣā
Samuccaya](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-training-anthology-of-santideva-9780199391356?cc=us&lang=en&)‘s
chapter on patient endurance, Śāntideva urges aspiring bodhisattvas to
attain a meditative state (*samādhi*) called the Sarvadharmasukhākrānta,
which Charles Goodman translates as “Everything is Covered with
Happiness.” Śāntideva makes truly extraordinary claims about what is
possible for a bodhisattva who has attained this state. In Goodman’s
translation:

> Bodhisattvas who attain this feel only happy feelings toward all
> objects they are aware of, with no feelings of suffering or
> unhappiness. Even while feeling the pains of the torments of hell,
> they think only happy thoughts. Even while suffering all the harms of
> the human condition, such as having their hands, feet, or noses cut
> off, they think only happy thoughts. Even while being beaten with
> canes, half-canes, or whips, they have only happy thoughts. Even when
> thrown into prison… or while being cooked in oil, or pounded like
> sugarcane, or flattened like reeds, or set on fire like an oil lamp, a
> butter lamp, or a yogurt lamp, they think only happy thoughts. (ŚS
> 181-2)

The passage is surprising, and modern readers often approach it with
deep skepticism. We cannot imagine someone feeling this way; we think it
must be impossible. Surely these are exaggerations? Surely it is
psychologically unrealistic for anyone to attain such a state?

I think there is at least one significant empirical reason to believe
that these claims are not exaggerated, and his name is Thich Quang Duc.

Thich Quang Duc was a senior Vietnamese monk who attained fame during
the early escalation of the Vietnam War in 1963. It is sometimes claimed
that he was protesting against the war, but that is not true. Rather, he
was protesting the discrimination against Buddhists by the Vietnamese
government of the time, under the Catholic leader Ngo Dinh Diem. What
earned Quang Duc his fame, though, was not the cause he supported but
the act with which he supported it.

In front of eyewitnesses and journalists, Quang Duc sat himself down at
a busy Saigon road intersection in a meditative position. A colleague
poured gallons of gasoline on Quang Duc’s head, at which point Quang Duc
pulled out a match and lit himself on fire. Before this act, he had left
a letter outlining the Buddhists’ demands. The act made enough of a
media impact to destroy support for the Diem régime, which was
overthrown in a coup within the year.

Journalist David Halberstam, an eyewitness, said of Quang Duc: “As he
burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward
composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him.” That
composure is captured in Malcolm Browne’s famous photo of the act,
attached here. To all outward appearances, at least, Quang Duc was not
mentally affected by literally being on fire. Perhaps it was not the
case that Quang Duc thought only *happy* thoughts, but his negative
thoughts and feelings were weak enough to make him appear completely
serene while being “set on fire like an oil lamp”, just as Śāntideva
describes.

This practice of burning oneself alive in protest has become
increasingly common in modern Buddhism: [more than a hundred Tibetans
are said to have done
this](https://www.foxnews.com/world/tibetan-dies-after-self-immolation-reports-say)
in the name of independence from China. For whatever reason, though,
reports in Tibet rarely mention what to me is most striking about Quang
Duc’s case, over fifty years after his death, which is the self-burner’s
mental state. Quang Duc gives us very strong reason to believe that, for
some people at least, the kind of radical equanimity described by
Śāntideva is actually achievable. A related case is that of [Matthieu
Ricard](https://www.wired.com/2003/09/scientists-meditate-on-happiness/?currentPage=all),
the Tibetan monk who showed record, off-the-charts levels of activity in
the centres of the brain associated with happiness.

The point relates to larger questions about the Buddhist path. My
students this year wondered whether nirvana could really be possible in
this life, as is claimed for the Buddha – for surely, if a rock hit the
Buddha on his head, he would experience pain? I brought up Thich Quang
Duc in that context, and noted that it may well depend on what we mean
by “pain”. Quang Duc was surely experiencing the physical sensations
(*vedanā*) of having his flesh burn. Yet it seems that, as Śāntideva
would claim, these sensations did not translate into significant mental
discomfort. He had trained himself out of that.

The next important question one should ask is: *how* could one train
oneself so? I have no reason to believe that an ordinary worldling like
myself would have anything like Quang Duc’s composure in his situation.
And I don’t know what Quang Duc’s own practice was. But I *do* know
Śāntideva’s answer to the questions of why bodhisattvas are still happy
when tortured:

> Such bodhisattva great beings have practiced this way of life for a
> long time, after making this aspiration prayer: “All those who may
> devour me, may they attain the happiness of peace and tranquility. All
> those who may protect me, treat me with respect, take me as their
> spiritual teacher, honor me, or make offerings to me, may they attain
> the happiness of tranquility. And also, all those who curse me, treat
> me badly, beat me, cut me with knives, or in any way deprive me of
> life – may all of them attain the happiness of full Awakening. (ŚS
> 182, Goodman’s translation)

For Śāntideva this is not quite the same as [karmic
redirection](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/06/wishing-george-w-bush-well/),
but it is extremely similar. Such practices of [wishing one’s enemies
well](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2009/06/wishing-george-w-bush-well/)
are unquestionably difficult. And one should be [careful about what they
do and don’t
imply](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2011/05/on-celebrating-the-death-of-an-enemy/).
But I have found them deeply valuable and helpful, on [multiple
occasions](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/10/the-rejection-of-righteous-anger/).
Such a practice hasn’t got me anywhere near the place where I could
think only happy thoughts while being set on fire like an oil lamp. But
it would appear that, at least for some people who practise something
like it rigorously enough, it can.
