Princeton Lecture Video, “Infinite Paths to Infinite Reality: Sri Ramakrishna’s Vijñāna-Based Doctrine of the Harmony of All Religions”

As part of my responsibilities as Visiting Professor at Princeton
University for 2018-9, I am inviting guest speakers for a lecture series
entitled “New Directions in Indian and Comparative Philosophy.” We are
recording each of these lectures to share with interested students and
scholars around the world. The first of our speakers was Ayon Maharaj,
whose talk on Nov. 27 was entitled “Infinite Paths to Infinite Reality:
Sri Ramakrishna’s Vijñāna-Based Doctrine of the Harmony of All
Religions.” Click on [this

to hear his lecture, followed by a formal response by Vineet Chander and
an audience Q-and-A.

Stay tuned for videos of upcoming lectures in 2019 by guest speakers
such as Arindam Chakrabarti (Stony Brook University) and Isabelle Ratié
(Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle).
