Writing on South Asian Philosophy? A few tips for younger colleagues

If you write on Plato, you should start in medias res. If you write on
Thomas Aquinas, you can do the same (unless you are writing for a
journal specialising on something completely different, say, business
ethics). If you write on a slightly less known author, I would suggest
adding at least the dates of birth and death and perhaps a short
description of their main work (say “the epistemologist XW
(1200–1250)”). What about writing on a niche topic, say, South Asian
philosophy? If you are writing for a non-specialist journal, you will
need to explain a lot, since no one will know even the main authors,
ideas and schools you will name. Nonetheless, this does not mean that
each new piece on that niche topic should resemble a pale summary of
scholarhip on it. Even if you need to tell, say, who Jayanta was and
what *nyāyā* means, this does not mean that you cannot make an original
contribution to the debate.

1.  Just start with what you discovered. Did Jayanta think that
    justification is not needed in the case of the “ought” domain? Are
    you the first one who noticed this move? Be sure that this is your
    departing point.
2.  You can *then* move to the background needed to appreciate the depth
    of your discovery. Do not just start with the background, otherwise
    your reader will think there is nothing new and close your article
    before reaching its core.
3.  Be sure that theme and rheme are well distinguished in your article.
    The reader should not be confused about what is just a short summary
    of the background and what is your new and original contribution.
4.  Please remember that an article is not a book. You can only convey
    *one* point. Don’t try to overdo or you will not manage to convey
    anything at all.

**What do other readers working on niche topics do? What do you
recommend to your students?**
