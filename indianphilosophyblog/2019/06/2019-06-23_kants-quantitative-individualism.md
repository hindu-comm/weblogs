In response to my discussion a while ago of the [problems between
Buddhism and qualitative
individualism](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2019/02/10/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/),
[Patrick O’Donnell](https://independent.academia.edu/PatrickSODonnell)
[suggested](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2019/02/10/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/#comment-261540)
that J. David Velleman’s *Self to Self* offered a possibility of
bridging the gap between the two. My reaction was skeptical, since
Velleman [explicitly situates himself as a
Kantian](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/233898?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),
and I have taken Kant as exactly the opposite kind of individualist, a
[quantitative
individualist](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/).
I [said as
much](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2019/02/10/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/#comment-262789)
in response, claiming that for Kant “ethically most significant about
human beings are those characteristics we all share, not our differences
– the right way for one person to act in a given context is broadly the
right way for any other person to act in the same context.”

Patrick’s response was where the discussion got really interesting. For
this is the first time I’ve seen someone question the very distinction
between qualitative and quantitative individualism. In his words: “I’m
not at all drawn to the putative merits of this distinction between
‘quantitative’ and ‘qualitative’ individualism if only because I don’t
understand Kantian autonomy, human dignity, and practical rationality
associated with the individual person in the manner you have sketched
it.” Since my current thought relies pretty heavily on this distinction
(a relatively obscure distinction [from the works of Georg
Simmel](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/)),
I think it’s on me to say more.

I do think it’s essential to distinguish qualitative from quantitative
individualism. If anything, one of my problems with Simmel’s way of
putting the distinction might be that it makes the two ideologies sound
*too much* alike, by treating the two of them as species of a singular
genus called individualism. [Other terms
used](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/)
to name qualitative individualism –“Romanticism”, “expressivism”, “the
ethics of authenticity” –do not share this feature, and they might make
it a bit clearer how little qualitative individualism has in common with
Kant.

Regarding Kant, my own understanding of Kant’s ethics – derived
primarily from reading and teaching the
[Grounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysic_of_Morals)
many times – ties closely to his own first formulation of the
categorical imperative: “Act only in accordance with that maxim through
which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.” We
should only act in ways that can be *universalized*. And this is so
because universality is characteristic of *reason* –and it is reason
that makes us truly autonomous. Kant says:

> What else, then, can freedom of the will be but autonomy, i.e., the
> property that the will has of being a law to itself? The proposition
> that the will is in every action a law to itself expresses, however,
> nothing but the principle of acting according to no other maxim than
> that which can at the same time have itself as a universal law for its
> object. (Grounding 447, Ellington translation)

The opposite of this autonomy is “the heteronomy of nature”, which Kant
identifies with “the natural law of desires and inclinations” (453). Our
desires and inclinations of course vary from individual to individual;
universal law, *qua* universal law, does not. It is not that we must
always act against our particular inclinations, but rather that they are
unimportant in determining autonomous right action; that action conforms
to a universal moral law.

All of this, I think, stands in sharp contrast to the views of the
qualitative individualists. The qualitative individualist treats “be
yourself” as an ideal, the actualization of one’s difference and
specificity as distinct from others: in Nietzsche’s phrasing, one
becomes what one is. Where Nietzsche or Emerson say to be more
individual, Kant tells us to be more universal –to act according to the
same moral law that everyone else should act under.

Patrick’s response quotes heavily from the work of Onora O’Neill, but I
don’t think O’Neill’s work falsifies any of this. I think this passage
from Patrick’s response is instructive:

> O’Neill clarifies how Kantian ethics is “far from being empty or
> formalistic,” nor does it lead to “rigidly insensitive rules.” Rather,
> it is able to “take account of differences between cases.” How so? “ …
> \[U\]niversal principles need not mandate uniform treatment; indeed,
> they may mandate differentiated treatment. Principles such as
> ‘taxation should be proportionate to ability to pay’ or ‘the
> punishment must fit the crime’ are universal in scope but demand
> differentiated treatment. Even principles that do not specifically
> mandate differentiated treatment will be indeterminate, so leave room
> for differentiated application.”

I agree with all of this. Kantian quantitative individualism is quite
able to handle differentiated *treatment*. But Kant’s differentiated
treatment – as it is described in O’Neill’s examples – has entirely to
do with different *cases* or *situations*, and not with different people
and their different *natures*, their personalities or cares or desires
or inclinations. So I stand by my original claim that for Kant “the
right way for one person to act *in a given context* is broadly the
right way for any other person to act *in the same context*.” Different
contexts and situations demand different actions; of course Kant
understands that. But does he think different *people* should act
differently, based on their different natures *as* different people,
when placed in the same situation? Not as far as I can tell.

To return to the Buddhist context of the [original
post](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/02/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/),
I think a Kantian understanding of the self is in important ways *less*
compatible with a Buddhist understanding than is a qualitative
individualist one of the sort I have been articulating elsewhere. (My
putting my claim in this way is probably tantamount to daring [Justin
Whitaker](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/07/the-dhamma-is-not-a-transcendent-law/)
to jump in with objections, and I look forward to these.) Specifically,
I
[claimed](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/02/how-can-you-be-yourself-if-there-is-no-self/)
that the qualitative individualist self is divisible, mutable and not
autonomous, all of which bring it closer to Buddhist views of the self.
And I don’t think the Kantian self is any of these. In my understanding
of it, it is identified with a will constituted by a single capacity for
rational decision-making, which needs to be understood as divisible and
mutable. I suppose that’s somewhat arguable, but the last one hardly
seems so: if a good Kantian self is anything, it’s autonomous. So, as
far as trying to bridge between Buddhism and qualitative individualism
goes, I see no reason to pursue Velleman’s work – because as far as I
can tell it is neither of the two.
