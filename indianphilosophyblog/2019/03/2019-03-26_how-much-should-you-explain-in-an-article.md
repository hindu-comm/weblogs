How much should you explain in an article?

Suppose you spent a long time (weeks, months, perhaps even years)
understanding a complicated topic. You then write an article or a book
about it. Where should you start from? Should you explain all or just
assume to have readers who more or less share your expertise?

The question is certainly relevant for all philosophers, but perhaps
even more for people working on niches, such as the history of Mīmāṃsā
deontic thought or the early developments of the Maṇipravāḷa soteriology
in South India and so on. Sure, it would be nice to speak with people
who shared out interest and to whom we did not need to explain all, but
these people are very few.

**Who is your ideal reader?** Are they the colleagues next door, who
know all about philosophy, but nothing about Sanskrit? Are they
Sanskritists who do not know about your field? Do you envision your
first-year students reading you?

I, for one, feel a moral obligation to at least try to be understandable
by fellow Sanskritists (who would need to check some philosophical
terms) and philosophers (who will find in the footnotes some technical
explanations about the one or the other Sanskrit term). I may fail and I
often end up addressing the more limited community of philosophers who
know some Sanskrit or Sanskritists who are also interested in
philosophy. However, I try not to restrict it further. Now, you may
object that I cannot re-establish the history of Mīmāṃsā again in each
article. Right, but I can use a small space for some basic elements and
then point to further accessible sources.

Still, I think that we have a moral obligation to at least try to be
accessible. Why?

1.  First of all, I am paid by taxpayers. I want to be able to give back
    to as many of them as possible what I learnt thanks to their taxes.
2.  Second, I think it is somehow intellectually dishonest to struggle
    for weeks on the translation of a technical term and then just put
    the final solution in an article without further comments, as if one
    had known it since the beginning. I want my readers to be able to
    benefit of my efforts by knowing, e.g., what helped me in
    understanding X, so that they can use the same method or the same
    resource when confronted with something resembling X.
3.  Last, it is more often than not the case that by explaining to lay
    readers, I myself become aware of small points I would have
    otherwise overseen.

Thus, explaining is often a win-win business!

**What is your rule of thumb?**
