INDIAN PHILOSOPHY IN NEW YORK: Mind, World, and Attention: Themes from Indian and Buddhist Philosophical Theory

Please see the announcement below for what looks like an exceptional
conference happening in late April in New York City. Submitted by
Jonardon Ganeri.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY IN NEW YORK

Mind, World, and Attention:  
Themes from Indian and Buddhist Philosophical Theory

When: 25th and 26th April, 2019. 9am to 5pm  
Where: NYU New York, USA. 19 Washington Square North

The philosophical traditions of India offer contemporary researchers an
unparalleled and mostly untapped resource for fresh thinking about
attention, its relations to mind and world. From Nyāya manas-theory to
the extensive Buddhist theories about attention’s relationship with
consciousness, and from precise taxonomies of the varieties of attention
to discussions about the norms governing attention, epistemic, moral,
and practical, the wealth and sophistication of Indian analysis is
astounding. Our workshop will look at the ways in which Indian,
including Buddhist, philosophical theory can enrich contemporary
discussion, and there will be presentations by a world-class panel of
speakers.

We hope too that this workshop will serve as a catalyst to Indian
philosophical studies in the New York area. The workshop is open to
everyone, and the program is
