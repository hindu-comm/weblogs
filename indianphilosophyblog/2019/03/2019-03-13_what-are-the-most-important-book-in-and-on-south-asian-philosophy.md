What are the most important books in and on South Asian philosophy?

Just imagine you are asked about the three most important texts in South
Asian philosophy and take a minute to imagine your answer. You are also
allowed to include texts on South Asian philosophy, if you think they
are relevant.

Next, you can compare your answers with [those of scholars like Jonardon
Ganeri, Maria Heim, Chakravarti Ram-Prasad and Evan
Thompson](https://www.thereadinglists.com/most-important-indian-philosophy-books/).
The guest, Phil Treagus, is a bibliophile and already hosted posts on
the most important books on several topics in philosophy, including
Chinese philosophy. A praiseworthy addition is that he also invited a
young PhD student, Jack Beaulieu.

You are also welcome to add your lists in the comments.
