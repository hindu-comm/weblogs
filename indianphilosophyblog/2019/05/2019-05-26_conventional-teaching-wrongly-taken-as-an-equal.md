Conventional teaching wrongly taken as an equal

I demonstrated [last
time](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/05/mere-convention-vs-seeing-correctly)
why Buddhaghosa believes the ultimate (*paramattha*) to be higher and
truer than the conventional (*vohāra* or *sammuti*). But this is not to
say that he finds the conventional *unnecessary*. Charles Hallisey
rightly points out its value in his important “[In defense of rather
fragile and local
achievement](http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1988-religion-and-practical-reason.aspx)“.
Hallisey notes that the conventional is essential for pedagogical
purposes, and those purposes *matter*. The conventional is at least as
*important* as the ultimate – but the ultimate, as I noted last time,
remains *truer*. If it were not truer, there would be no need for it;
the conventional would simply be superior, since it is more effective at
teaching and persuading people.

In [*The Forerunner of All
Things*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-forerunner-of-all-things-9780199331048?cc=us&lang=en&)
– a generally strong book of which I stand by my [previous
praise](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2016/01/on-the-very-idea-of-buddhist-ethics/)
– Maria Heim claims that in that same article Hallisey argues “the
Theravādins do not see ultimate (*paramattha*) teachings as truer than
conventional (*sammuti*) teachings”, following this up with her own
comment that “They have different purposes but are equally truthful ways
of describing the world, and the Theravāda sources do not place them in
a hierarchy.” (*Forerunner* 90)

But that is not quite what Hallisey says in the chapter at issue. He
does observe Buddhaghosa’s commentary on the
[Kathāvatthu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathavatthu) as “a use of
these labels which considers the conventional and absolute not as
hierarchically ranked, but only as separate and contrasted.” (128) The
Kathāvatthu commentary (in the Puggalakathā section) says “whether
\[Buddhas\] use conventional speech or absolute speech, they speak what
is true, what is factual, not false.” (Hallisey 129) But two things need
to be said about Hallisey’s observation in this passage.

First, both Hallisey’s translation and the original Pali cast strong
doubt on Ram-Prasad and Heim’s claim that “Unlike some Indian Buddhist
traditions that take these to refer to truths or ‘levels’ of truth,
Buddhaghosa takes sammuti and paramattha to refer to two modes of
teachings (*kathā*) or language (*bhāsā*); he does not rank them in
their descriptive accuracy.” (1106) Hallisey translates the relevant
passage for this claim as:

> The Perfectly Enlightened One, the best of teachers, spoke two truths
> \[*duve saccāni*\], that is, the customary and the absolute – one does
> not come across a third; a customary statement is true because of
> convention and an absolute statement is true since it is about the
> real characteristics of things \[*dhammānaṃ tathalakkhaṇa*\].
> (Kathāvatthu Aṭṭhakathā 34)

Here, note, Buddhaghosa indeed uses *sammuti* and *paramattha* to
describe two *sacca*s, two truths, not merely different modes of
teachings or language – though they are both indeed true. And the truth
of *paramattha* is because it is *dhammānaṃ tathalakkhaṇa*, which
Hallisey renders “about the real characteristics of things” (*dhamma*s).

Second, on the next page Hallisey notes that the “contrastive treatment
of conventional and absolute truth” in the Kathāvatthu commentary “does
not, however, preclude a hierarchical ordering. It leaves open the
possibility that conventional and absolute teaching could be integrated
in a hierarchy.” (130) And Hallisey then proceeds to quote another
passage, this time from the commentary to the Aṅguttara Nikāya, in which
Buddhaghosa proceeds to do exactly that. The passage maps *sammuti* and
*paramattha* onto the hermeneutical distinction between texts with a
direct meaning (*nītattha*) and those which need further specification
(*neyyattha*). It argues that when in a *sutta* the Buddha is said to
speak of a person,

> its sense has to be inferred since there is no individual in the
> absolute sense (*paramattho*). But a person because of his folly may
> take this as a sutta of direct meaning and would argue that the
> Tathagata would not have said “there is one individual, O monks” etc.
> unless a person existed in the absolute sense. (translated in Hallisey
> 130)

And so, Hallisey argues:

> Although Buddhaghosa accepts both indirect and direct teaching as
> valid, he emphasizes here the danger of taking indirect teaching
> independently from direct teaching. This could result in a confusion
> of the two, with conventional teaching *wrongly* taken as an equal to
> absolute teaching. With this as a possibility, it is inadequate only
> to separate and contrast the conventional and the absolute. Once they
> are connected, absolute teaching may serve as a constraint, and if
> necessary a corrective, against the confusion which the conventional
> itself is unable to check. Thus knowledge of absolute teaching
> contributes to knowledge and mastery of the conventional, but not vice
> versa. (131, emphasis added)

The ultimate can correct the conventional; the reverse is not true. It
is *wrong* to take conventional as equal to the ultimate. Hallisey’s
interpretation seems to me on the whole to be harmonious with the
passages quoted from the Visuddhimagga in this and previous discussions.
Conventional truth is indeed mere (*matta*), and it is that because its
truth is of a sort that is merely pedagogically helpful; it needs to be
corrected by a further, absolute, ultimate truth which is about the real
characteristics (*tatthalakkhana*) of *dhamma*s. That ultimate truth in
turn does not need to be corrected by the conventional, and it is in
this sense that the conventional remains mere, lesser.

It matters that Hallisey is referring to Buddhaghosa’s *aṭṭhakathā*s –
his commentaries on *sutta* and *abhidhamma* texts – rather than to his
magnum opus the Visuddhimagga, which is the subject of Heim and
Ram-Prasad’s article. One could plausibly find text-critical grounds to
object that these texts had different authors. But Heim, at least,
explicitly rejects such a move in *Forerunner*, seeking to treat the
works attributed to Buddhaghosa as a unity. I approve of her approach
there, and so I stand by the claim that Buddhaghosa views *sammuti* as
lesser than *paramattha*.
