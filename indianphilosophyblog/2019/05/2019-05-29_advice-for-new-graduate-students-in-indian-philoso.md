Advice for new graduate students in Indian philosophy

Recently I was asked for advice by an incoming graduate student who was
interested in research in Indian philosophy. As I’ve given a lot of the
same advice to my own students during the past few years, and had others
get in touch with me, I thought I’d put down my thoughts and see if
others have thoughts to add.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Language skills.** If you want to work on Indian or South Asian
    philosophy more generally as main area of research, you need
    language skills. You should start on this as early as possible (if
    you haven’t before the PhD) and find as many opportunities to read
    in those languages as you can.
    -   Don’t neglect reading beyond *śāstra* texts. Not only does
        reading *kāvya* and other genres improve your language skills,
        you are entering into the world of these thinkers by doing so.
        They aren’t writing in a vacuum.
    -   Summer programs, both for language-learning and reading
        workshops, are an excellent opportunity to immerse yourself in
        these efforts.
    -   If you do not acquire proficiency in the languages of the texts
        you are reading (Pāli, Sanskrit, Tibetan, etc.) you will be
        limited to engaging with secondary material and texts in
        translation, which essentially limits you to doing an AOC rather
        than an AOS. \[Edited to add: “AOC” or “area of concentration”
        here means having some combination of undergraduate/early
        graduate teaching ability, some coursework, and perhaps some
        minor publications in an area, whereas an “AOS” or “area of
        specialization” means having advanced teaching ability, the
        majority of your coursework and research, and focus of your
        publications. It is my view that having an AOS in (premodern)
        Indian philosophy, as with any philosophy written in languages
        other than your own and in time-periods/cultures relatively
        distant from your own, almost always requires the ability to
        engage with original texts and not only secondary material.\]
-   **Mentors.** Unlike Anglo-European philosophy, which is represented
    broadly in philosophy programs in the English-speaking world (and,
    frankly, beyond), at most graduate programs, you will be lucky to
    find more than one person working in Indian philosophy. It is
    essential that you find mentors beyond them, not only pragmatically
    (for recommendation letters) but also philosophically.
    -   Example: suppose you want to work on philosophy of mind in
        Buddhism. Even if you are at a program where this is someone’s
        main area of research, it is important to understand the broader
        context of, say, Dharmakīrti. This would mean understanding
        Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā contributions, at the least.
    -   Even the most well-rounded philosopher has limitations and their
        own perspective. You want to ensure you are entering into the
        broader conversation in the field, and not only taking on your
        advisor’s perspective (even if you ultimately agree with them!).
-   **Community.** Studying in a program where the tradition is mainly
    Anglo-European can be lonely. As well, if your approach is
    historical rather than analytic (or the reverse), this can add to
    the sense of disconnect with other people’s projects. It’s important
    to find people that support your work, and to support them, too.
    -   Not all professors in your program may find Indian philosophy
        valuable. You can expect responses to your work to range from
        benign indifference to ignorance to active hostility (the latter
        is, I hope, increasingly rare). The same is true for other
        graduate students.
    -   Being a good contributor to philosophy more broadly in your
        department can help–actively supporting your fellow graduate
        students and attending talks can demonstrate you’re not “only”
        an “Indian philosopher” but a philosopher more generally.
    -   If there is a South Asian Studies or Religion program at your
        university, you may find fellow travelers there, who are
        philosophically-minded, or who are interested in your work from
        different angles.
-   **Research skills and norms.** Lastly, depending on your program and
    advisor (and your own background), you may have to work hard to
    learn scholarly norms governing Indian philosophy. You will need to
    learn where to find texts (SARIT, GRETIL, and various online
    repositories, unofficial and official) and how to engage with the
    wide range of sources (philological, historical, philosophical) that
    you need do Indian philosophy.
    -   The [Indology](http://indology.info/) website is a good starting
        point for learning some of this. Look as well at online blogs
        for exemplars and discussions of good research.
    -   Look at publications in well-regarded journals for their use of
        sources, transliteration styles, bibliographies, and so on. Try
        reading not just for content (arguments, claims) but for
        structure and method.
    -   Ask your advisor and other mentors to describe their research
        process to you–they may assume you already know how to compare
        printed editions, how to find and evaluate secondary material,
        and so on. However, this process is not always explicitly
        taught, despite its being important to historically-grounded
        work (whether your methodology is “history of philosophy,”
        “fusion philosophy,” “comparative philosophy,” and so on).
-   **Balance.** Finally, unlike the comic strip at the top, I think
    it’s important to find a balance of academic and non-academic focus.
    You may thinkthat, with having to learn new languages, keep up to
    date in multiple areas of research, teaching classes, attending
    talks, etc., you don’t have time for hobbies or rest (or your
    family, if you have one!). The pressure in graduate school is
    immense. But in my opinion, it’s important to find time to do things
    which are not related to your work. Read some fiction. Take some
    hikes. Play with your dog or cat. Meet people outside of academia.
    Your mental health (and your work) will benefit from it.
