Bright on Eurocentrism

A recent post [“On
Eurocentrism”](https://sootyempiric.blogspot.com/2019/04/on-eurocentrism.html)
from Liam Bright on [his blog *The Sooty
Empiric*](https://sootyempiric.blogspot.com/)raises some interesting
questions about the role of Eurocentrism in the study of non-Western
philosophy. While Bright is not writing specifically about the study of
Indian/South Asian philosophy, I thought it might be worthwhile to start
a conversation about these issues on this blog.

Bright, who is a “consumer” rather than “producer” of work on
non-Western philosophy, begins with a phenomenon he has noticed.

> … so here is a thing I see a lot of in articles introducing English

Bright goes on to attribute this tendency to two types of Eurocentrism.

> The second thing I think is behind this is a filter somewhat

> Condorcet and Carnap. …

Rather than respond in detail myself, I thought I’d leave readers with a
few questions to consider and (hopefully) to discuss.

1.  Do you think Bright is identifying a feature that is present in much
    work on non-Western philosophy today? If so, is it problematic? It
    this a type of Eurocentrism, “benevolent” or otherwise?
2.  Is the situation different when it comes to work on Indian/South
    Asian philosophy?
3.  What would non-Eurocentric work in non-Western philosophy look like
    (if it does not exist already)? Are comparative projects that do
    not take Western philosophy as one of its subjects of comparison,
    more pure history of philosophy projects, or more historical-textual
    studies the answer? Or do we need to imagine an entirely new
    approach?

Let me say a bit on question two. My sense is that our sub-field
(especially work in English and other European languages) is shaped by
its opposition to “mainstream” Western philosophy, but that the precise
ways in which it is shaped are somewhat different than the ways Bright
has identified.

Part of this may be that there is a great deal of diversity within the
Indian tradition when it comes to mind-body dualism, embodied knowledge,
communalism, and so forth. Perhaps another factor has to do with the
specific forms of Eurocentrism (especially Orientalism) that form the
historical context in which our sub-field developed. Consider, for
instance, two major trends: the tendency to focus on “religious” or
“soteriological” aspects of South Asian thought and the tendency to be
especially concerned to compare South Asian philosophy with contemporary
Anglo-American analytic philosophy.

What do you, dear readers, think about all this?
