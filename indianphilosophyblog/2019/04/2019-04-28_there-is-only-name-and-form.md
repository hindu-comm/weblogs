There is only name and form

I now begin my [responses to Chakravarthi
Ram-Prasad](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/04/the-importance-of-reading-buddhaghosa-closely)
on the thought of Buddhaghosa. Let me first reiterate a point I made
[early
on](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/04/buddhaghosa-on-seeing-things-as-they-are-1/):
what I refuse is the interpretation that Buddhaghosa’s understanding of
ultimate, conventional and the aggregates are *merely* phenomenological
and *not* ontological. That is, I reject Heim and Ram-Prasad’s claim
that “Buddhaghosa does *not* use abhidhamma as a reductive ontological
division of the human being into mind and body, *but* as the
contemplative structuring of that human’s phenomenology.” Emphasis
added. I am not, and never was, denying a phenomenological *element* to
Buddhaghosa’s ideas; I would have no objection to the claim that
Buddhaghosa uses
[abhidhamma](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abhidharma/) categories
as *both* an ontological division of a human being *and* as a
structuring of that human’s experience (contemplative or otherwise). As
far as I can tell, the ontology/phenomenology distinction is not one
that Buddhaghosa employs; in Heim and Ram-Prasad’s article I do not see
any evidence that Buddhaghosa makes such a separation.

Indeed that very distinction of phenomenology from ontology seems to me
to depend on a distinction between subject (the topic of phenomenology)
and object (the topic of ontology). Such a split seems to me one that
Buddhaghosa is unlikely to want to make, given his commitment to
deconstruct the self/subject. And I think the refusal of such a split
may be lent support by Heim and Ram-Prasad’s article itself, on points
which I did not refer to because I suspect I am in agreement with them:
namely, that Buddhaghosa makes no significant split between mind and
matter.

There are times where Heim and Ram-Prasad seem to attempt to deconstruct
a subject-object split and yet reinforce it in the same passage.
Consider Buddhaghosa’s description of the elements (*bhūta*s):

> He should advert to the four elements in this way: “What are the
> characteristic, function, manifestation of the earth elemental?” The
> earth elemental has the characteristic of hardness. Its function is to
> act as a foundation. It is manifested as receptivity. The water
> elemental has the characteristic of flowing. Its function is to
> spread. It is manifested as accumulating. The fire elemental has the
> characteristic of heat. Its function is to bring to maturity. It is
> manifested as a regulation of softness. The air elemental has the
> characteristic of distending. Its function is to cause motion. It is
> manifested as acting outward. (XI.93)

Now here is Heim and Ram-Prasad’s exegesis of the passage:

> What brings out Buddhaghosa’s phenomenological orientation is his
> standard utilization of not only description by function, but also by
> characteristic and manifestation. We should resist the temptation to
> think that this is one side of a subjective-objective divide, because
> when we turn to how he deals with the characteristic of each
> elemental, we note in fact that he details the quality of their feel:
> hardness and the like. So we can be sure that Buddhaghosa is not
> treating this crucial type of a crucial category of abhidhamma – one
> which, if anywhere, we might find a robust ontology – as a
> metaphysical postulate. (1097)

They are quite right to note that subjective feel is one part of
Buddhaghosa’s description, which does indeed bring out his
phenomenological orientation. This is indeed not one side of a
subjective-objective divide. But the last sentence does not follow! The
fact that the characteristics (*lakkhana*) of elements (*bhūta*) have to
do with their subjective feel, does *not* imply that the elements cannot
therefore be objective and metaphysical. They could be, and I think that
for Buddhaghosa they are, both. But here Heim and Ram-Prasad appear to
infer, without any textual evidence that I can discern, that because
they are one they *cannot* be the the other. For that inference to work,
I think we would have to assume exactly that subjective-objective divide
that Heim and Ram-Prasad have elsewhere so ably shown that Buddhaghosa
does not subscribe to.

One can turn around the first sentence here: Buddhaghosa describes the
elements not only by characteristic and manifestation, but also by
function. (The term for function is *rasa*; Heim, in her [excellent
first book on
Buddhaghosa](https://www.amazon.com/Forerunner-All-Things-Buddhaghosa-Intention/dp/0199331049),
points out that Pali commentary uses this term in a sense very different
from [the more familiar Sanskrit aesthetic
one](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/08/the-indian-theory-of-taste/),
with Buddhaghosa defining it in terms of duty or function, *kicca*, or
attainment, *sampatti*.) And when Buddhaghosa specifies the element’s
function, he specifies it in terms of what the element does in physical
space – spreading, acting as a foundation – with no reference made to
subjective feel. Unless we are seeking to superimpose our own purely
phenomenological view onto the texts, I do not see any reason to view
this function or attainment as something merely phenomenological – a way
the element appears to function – and exclude ontology, the way the
element actually *does* function. To do so seems to do exactly what Heim
and Ram-Prasad have warned us against, and treat Buddhaghosa’s
descriptions as one side of a subjective-objective divide – in this case
the subjective.

When Buddhaghosa illustrates the key term *rūpa*, he does so with an
analogy that goes beyond subjective feel and even manifestation. He
quotes a passage from the Majjhima Nikāya which says (in the Ñāṇamoli
translation): “Just as when a space is enclosed with timber and creepers
and grass and clay, there comes to be the term ‘house,’ so too, when a
space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, there comes
to be the term *rūpa*.” (Vism XVIII.26) Here he is saying that *rupa*
includes those inner elements that we would *not* normally perceive or
feel subjectively, the things that are typically invisible to us: the
bones in the body, the timbers of a house.

This point brings us to *nāmarūpa*, that compound at the heart of their
article’s concernes. I agree with what I took to be their most basic
point about *nāmarūpa*. That is: *Nāmarūpa* is most commonly translated,
somewhat opaquely, as “name and form”. Some translators have tried to
render it in a more English idiom as “mind and matter” or “mentality and
materiality”. I think Heim and Ram-Prasad are quite right to resist that
latter interpretation, pointing out that *rūpa* includes mental elements
of subjective feel. I am in agreement with the “more careful scholars”
they name, like Steven Collins and Sue Hamilton, who keep the “name and
form” translation within “a metaphysical account of the human being
where the disaggregative project of analyses for dismantling selfhood
produces an account of smaller constituent parts, which are then
affirmed as reals.”

Buddhaghosa asserts the paramount importance of *nāmarūpa* in
Visuddhimagga XVIII.24-28, the key passage from which Heim and
Ram-Prasad draw their title; we have [discussed this passage
before](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2018/05/13/buddhaghosa-on-seeing-things-as-they-are-3/)
and will discuss it again. In this central passage Buddhaghosa says –in
Heim and Ram-Prasad’s translation – “One concludes that there is only
name and form and nothing beyond them such as a being, person, deity, or
Brahmā.” (*Nāmarūpamattato uddhaṃ añño satto vā puggalo vā devo vā
brahmā vā natthīti niṭṭhaṃ gacchati*, Vism XVIII.24) So too, he says
*paramatthato pana nāmarūpamattameva atthīti. Evaṃ passato hi dassanaṃ
yathābhūtadassanaṃ nāma hoti* (Vism XVIII.28), which they render:
“seeing correctly is the seeing of one who sees in this way, that from
the standpoint of further sense \[*paramatthatas*\], there is only name
and form.” (34) Note the use of *atthi*/*hoti* and *natthi*, “there is”
and “there is not”, in both these quotations – and in the translations.
Not “there appears”, “there arises to consciousness”, but *there is*.
Buddhaghosa is making claims about what *exists* – which is, by
definition, exactly the subject matter of ontology.

Ram-Prasad claims in [his reply to
me](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2018/05/13/buddhaghosa-on-seeing-things-as-they-are-3/#comment-221579)
that

> to disaggregate the notion of ‘person’ is to come to ‘see correctly’
> that our experience of ourselves is not of irreducibly single
> subjects. To then take this exercise to be an assertion that there is
> an ultimate reality of disaggregated entities is a further step, and
> not one that Buddhaghosa argues for epistemologically.

But there is no reference in this key passage, or in any other passage
that Heim and Ram-Prasad quote, to any notion translatable as
“experience”. Vism XVIII.28 explains *seeing* correctly, and it explains
seeing correctly as “seeing that” –expressing what one sees within a
dependent clause, using the *iti* particle. One could perhaps take this
“seeing” in a very figurative sense and render it as “experience”. But
Ram-Prasad’s comment goes further: he claims that *what* we come to see
correctly, the *object* of our seeing, is “our experience of ourselves”.
And there is no support at all for that claim in this passage.
Buddhaghosa makes no claim that we see “our experience of ourselves” is
not of subjects. Rather, what we see is that *there are* no subjects
(but rather only name and form). There is no word here that can be
translated “experience”. A “further step”, a step that Buddhaghosa does
not argue for, is taken when we add *that* concept, the concept of
experience – and *not* by adding the concept of existence, which is
right there in the passage. For Buddhaghosa’s sentence simply does not
say that one who sees correctly sees that his *experience* is only of
nāmarūpa. Rather, he sees that *there is* only nāmarūpa. When we are
seeing correctly, what we see is not that we do not *experience* single
subjects – something Buddhaghosa does not say in these passages about
correct seeing –but rather that *there are* no single subjects but only
name-and-form. When Buddhaghosa says “there is”, I would prefer to
interpret him as meaning not “there appears” or “we experience” but
“there is”, unless he gives have explicit reason to believe the
contrary.

As for whether this disaggregated existence of *nāmarūpa* is “ultimate”:
well, in this passage Buddhaghosa explicitly qualifies the claim that
“there is only nāmarūpa” with *paramatthatas*, an adverbial form of
*paramattha* – and the word *paramattha* is most commonly translated
“ultimate”. Indeed, in describing the same passage on page 1094, Heim
and Ram-Prasad themselves use the word “ultimately” to explicate
*paramatthatas*. There is more to say about *paramattha*, but that is
for the next post.
