Edith Hall on Aristotle, public-facing philosophy, and blogs

While notfocused onIndian philosophy, the short article by Edith Hall
notes that public-facing philosophy goes back to the roots of the
Western tradition. She connects this with philosophy blogs nowadays,
which is relevant for us.

> Most people do not realise that Aristotle wrote works designed for the
> general public. If they did, then perhaps more philosophers would
> automatically assume that they needed to follow his example. In an
> ideal society, all research conducted at universities would routinely
> be made available to the public, enabling more people to join
> conversations about politics, society, culture and science in informed
> and instrumental ways. This would require wholesale reform of the
> economic infrastructure of academia – for example, wresting control of
> the dissemination of research from commercial publishers, and reducing
> the inflated cost of journal subscriptions. But the internet means
> that we now have an exciting opportunity to revive Aristotle’s
> commitment to public philosophy.
