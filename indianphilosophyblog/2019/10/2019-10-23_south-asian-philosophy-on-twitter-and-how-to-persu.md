South Asian philosophy on twitter — and how to persuade your colleagues that there is philosophy in South Asia

You might have noticed it already (since I am well-known for being a
late adapter), but there are now several scholars of South Asian
philosophy on twitter, such as “our” Malcolm Keating, Amod Lele and
Ethan Mills, as well as Jonathan Duquette, Marco Ferrante, Marzenna
Jakubczak, Birgit Kellner, Cat Prueitt, Evan Thompson… Please **feel
free to mention the many I am missing in the comments.**

I am, as already said, a late adapter, but twitter made me get in touch
with interesting people coming from outside my direct field and I
enjoyed several insightful conversations. One such conversation is
directly relevant for many readers and I would be glad to read your
opinion about it.

Short premiss: Someone (teaching in another institute) writes me
explaining that their university would like to open a position on
“Indian philosophy”, but that some colleagues are against it, claiming
that “it is all religion”. Now, it might at times be disheartening to
hear such opinions coming from colleague philosophers, but how would you
react after a few deep breaths?

Here below comes my first reaction:

> There will always be people who think they know what there is even in
> places they never visited, and I guess it must be hard for you to be
> patient and try to explain your reasons without getting angry.
> Usually, books like Matilal’s and Ganeri’s ones are really helpful
> here. Perhaps, you might also point them to the podcast by Ganeri and
> Peter Adamson on the history of Indian Philosophy? \[…\] Many
> philosophers (especially historians of philosophy) know and trust P.
> Adamson and might be convinced by his opinion.
>
> Also, perhaps you might try to understand where these people come
> from. Are they historians of philosophy? Analytic philosophers?
> Phenomenologists? Using Matilal and Mohanty for the latter two groups
> respectively might really help… Ch. Ram-Prasad’s books are also great
> to reach people working in the so-called “continental philosophy”.
>
> Last resort: Give them a book which looks “religious”, like Parimal
> Patil’s *Against a Hindu God* and ask them what they think of the
> Buddhist syllogisms and their refutations of the Brahmanical ones.
>
> P.S. I know that your colleagues meant “religion” in a derogatory way,
> but South Asian philosophy that engages with religion is
> intellectually extremely stimulating, too (and would they really want
> to cancel Thomas Aquinas or Augustinus from their philosophical
> syllabi?)

How do you react in such cases? I have strong hopes in young colleagues
(like many of the ones I mentioned above) and in the positive effect
their contribution will have, especially once added to the tasks which
have already been accomplished by their forerunners. Till that moment
comes, however, we will have to think of convincing and polite answers.
**What will your answer be?**

This is a collective endeavour and we’ll need each other’s help. Please
check also the interesting answers I got on my
