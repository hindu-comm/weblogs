In defence of McMindfulness

The [mainstreaming of mindfulness
meditation](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/09/on-mindfulness/)
continues at a rapid clip. According to the Center for Disease Control,
in the years 2012 to 2017 the percentage of adults meditating in the
United States [more than
tripled](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db325-h.pdf), to 17%.
The American market for provision of meditation-related services is now
[worth $1 billion and
growing](https://www.marketdataenterprises.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Meditation-Mkt-2017-Press-Release.pdf).

With any phenomenon this mainstream, one expects a backlash. Sure
enough, there have been a number of pieces appearing recently that
chastise [programs like
BU’s](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/09/on-mindfulness/) under the
name “corporate mindfulness”, or more pithily, “McMindfulness”. [Ron
Purser](https://cob.sfsu.edu/directory/ronald-purser), a management
professor whose understanding of mindfulness [already informed
mine](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/09/on-mindfulness/), has now
written a very interesting [book with that
title](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600158/mcmindfulness-by-ronald-purser/).

There is a great deal in Purser’s book, most of which I cannot discuss
here. Purser is certainly right to raise questions about the mindfulness
movement –most notably the [continual
tension](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/09/is-mindfulness-meditation-a-problem-for-christians/)
between its Buddhist roots and supposed secularity, to which I don’t
think there are easy answers. But there is one theme running through
nearly every chapter where – [I might say “as a
Buddhist”](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/05/i-am-a-buddhist/) – I
found Purser’s approach quite troubling. For while Purser often takes
himself to be chiding modern mindfulness for being insufficiently
Buddhist, I think overall he is unwittingly criticizing it for being
*too* Buddhist.

[![g9510.20_mindful.indd](http://loveofallwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/time-cover-225x300.jpg)](http://loveofallwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/time-cover.jpg)Purser’s
critique begins with the 2014 *Time* cover proclaiming “the mindful
revolution”. Purser retorts:

> I am skeptical. Anything that offers success in our unjust society
> without trying to change it is not revolutionary — it just helps
> people cope. However, it could also be making things worse. Instead of
> encouraging radical action, it says the causes of suffering are
> disproportionately inside us, not in the political and economic
> frameworks that shape how we live. (7-8)

Purser is entirely right that the rhetoric of *revolution*, applied to
modern mindfulness practices, is overblown, perhaps even a little
ridiculous. So are many other claims made for the rise of mindfulness
practice, like Jon Kabat-Zinn’s claim that it constitutes

> a tremendous opportunity for addressing… the Orwellian distortions of
> truth we are now seeing on a daily basis in the news, and the
> perpetuation of dystopian “governance” by seemingly elevating greed,
> hatred, and delusion to new heights, with all its attendant
> consequences for the fragility of democratic institutions. (quoted on
> Purser 238)

All this is hype that is scarcely believable, and Purser is right to
call it out. But I am not ready to follow Purser’s further step that it
is “making things worse” to say “the causes of suffering are
disproportionately inside us”. I agree with Purser that the “fundamental
message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause of
dissatisfaction and distress is in our heads.” (9) But are we so sure
that that message is a bad thing?

That message, after all, isimpeccably and fundamentally Buddhist. It is
right there in the Second Noble Truth, which states the cause of
*dukkha* (which I’ve seen translated as dissatisfaction and distress, as
well as the more usual “suffering”) is craving. Śāntideva, too, tells us
that all fears and immeasurable sufferings come from the mind alone.
Neither Śāntideva nor the Pali *sutta*s have any interest whatsoever in
“radical action”; if anything, [they discourage
it](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2019/11/17/disengaged-buddhism/).

Purser laments that modern mindfulness’s emphasis on results “prevents
it being offered as a tool of resistance, restricting it instead to a
technique for ‘selfcare.'” (20) But why would we have ever thought it
*was* a “tool of resistance”? To think that it would or could be that,
seems like exactly the kind of hype that Kabat-Zinn engages in: making
mindfulness something it is not. It was not such a tool, after all, in
the hands of the Buddha of the suttas. His monks did in important
respects *opt out* of the prevailing social order, and indeed
occasionally criticized it – but they did not *fight* it, they did not
try to *change* it. Rather, they created a separate (monastic) social
order within the existing one –an order that one could even call
“privatized”.

Through the book Purser seems to keep pursuing the hope that mindfulness
could actually *be* a revolution, even in the face of people who rightly
agree that it isn’t. New York Times reporter David Gelles notes, rightly
I think, that ““We live in a capitalist economy, and mindfulness can’t
change that.” Purser replies: “Well, it certainly won’t if sold in those
terms.” (26) In which case I await the explanation of how a proper
mindfulness, tied to a Buddhism as engaged as possible, *will* change
the fact that we live in a capitalist economy – given that nothing else
ever has, with the possible but highly questionable exception of a
murderous set of barbarous régimes that killed more people than Hitler
did. Purser was doing well to critique the overblown portrayal of
mindfulness *as* revolutionary –why does he then still seem to hold up
such faith that it could or should be revolutionary?

After rightfully critiquing the overblown rhetoric of revolution
attached to modern mindfulness, Purser says “There is no radical
blueprint in paying attention. If the aim is to effect social change,
then methods of pursuing it need to be taught.” (246) And that’s true.
But I think Purser is too ready to take up rhetoric that makes
mindfulness into something it isn’t. In classical Buddhism the aim
*isn’t* to effect social change, and maybe that shouldn’t be the aim of
modern mindfulness either.

Purser notes that Buddhist mindfulness seeks to eradicate the three
poisons of *rāga*, *dveṣa/dosa* and *moha*, which he translates “greed,
ill will and delusion” (20). I could dispute a couple of these
translations, but the basic point is correct. The thing to notice about
it is: Purser objects to “a fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness,
that the source of people’s problems is found in their heads.” (38) But
“in our heads” is *exactly* where we find rāga, dveṣa and moha! If you
are telling us that the source of our problems is *not* in our heads,
then you are telling us that that source does not consist of any of
these problems. But that does seem to be exactly what Purser is saying.
If he accepts the Buddhist critique of dveṣa, it is grudgingly at best:

> According to mindfulness science, certain emotions — such as anger,
> disgust, sadness, contempt, frustration and aggression — are
> “destructive,” negative affects requiring emotional self-regulation.
> But what if one is angry, even enraged, about injustice? Just let it
> go. Focus on your breath. Bring your attention back to the present
> moment. Of course, mindfulness practitioners still have thoughts
> outside of practice, but they are conditioned to see these as problems
> if strong emotions get involved. This has a disempowering impact on
> political thinking. Even if it helps not to act with anger, we still
> need to act if we want things to change outside our heads. (42)

Many do follow such a project, which prioritizes fighting injustice and
pays incidental attention at best to fighting our own anger. But it
seems to me that such a project is quite far from traditional Buddhism –
in a way that “neoliberal mindfulness” might not be. Which then raises
the question: should we *be* far from traditional Buddhism? I’d like to
explore that question a bit more next time.
