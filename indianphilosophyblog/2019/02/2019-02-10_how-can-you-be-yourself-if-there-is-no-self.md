The rise of [qualitative
individualism](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/naming-the-be-yourself-ideal/)
in the West coincides relatively closely with Western interest in
Buddhism. Nietzsche and Emerson, two of the most influential qualitative
individualist thinkers, both had an interest in Buddhism stronger than
was usual for philosophers of their time. And the greatest flowering of
Western interest in Buddhism occured in the 1960s, the same time when
qualitative individualism itself became fully mainstream.

Qualitative individualism can be put in many ways, but one of its most
characteristic injunctions is “be yourself”. The injunction is often
phrased further in terms of one’s *true* self. Such ideas are of central
importance to the LGBT movement. A recent [news
profile](http://www.bu.edu/today/2018/what-transgender-means-to-me/)
asking Boston University students about the meaning of being transgender
finds many of them echoing a common refrain: “discovering your truest
self”, “finding one’s true identity”, “being their true selves”, “being
truly, completely, unapologetically me”.

None of this seems like a great fit, on the face of it at least, with a
tradition that has proclaimed for 2000 years that there *is* no self.

The philosophical difficulties are pretty profound here. I’ll admit that
the non-self teaching (*anattā/anātman*) has never been my favourite
part of Buddhism, and thinking through qualitative individualism has
helped me figure out why. I am a grandchild of the ’60s – [my
mother](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2012/09/my-mothers-meditations/)
was born in 1949 and came of age in that decade, and I grew up infused
with its ideals, believing in finding oneself and following one’s own
path. Now, though, [I have become a
Buddhist](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2015/05/i-am-a-buddhist/) –
[as, I think, has
she](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2012/09/my-mothers-meditations/).
And to take that Buddhism seriously requires taking non-self seriously.

It is important to point out here that for the first millennium of
Buddhism there not only *were* Buddhists who acknowledged something like
a self, but by some accounts they were among the most prevalent schools.
These Buddhists are now most commonly known by the name
[Pudgalavāda](https://www.iep.utm.edu/pudgalav/), “way of the person”, a
name given to them by their opponents – they typically called themselves
Vātsipūtrīya or Sāmmitīya. The problem with the Pudgalavāda is that they
have been extinct for millennia. One *could* call oneself a Pudgalavādin
today, but this would be much like adhering to an [Arian
Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) that rejects the
divinity of Jesus –one is not *outside* the tradition exactly, but one
has in some sense rejected the entire continuous living tradition. It is
worth at least looking for an approach more in harmony with the Buddhism
that still exists.

In that respect there are at least a few commonalities between
traditional Buddhism and qualitative individualism as I see them. One
can see these commonalities in what they both (explicitly or implicitly)
reject –the Christian soul and its successor the Cartesian I. Against a
Christian or Cartesian conception, Buddhists and qualitative
individualists can agree that what we call self is *divisible*: the
unity that it has is narrative, a story we tell. Because it is
narrative, it is *mutable*, at least until the point of death – we do
not have a fixed and unchanging essence, and that mutability is what
allows us to escape our bad habits and therefore suffering. And, perhaps
both most controversially and most importantly, as I understand both
traditions the self is *not autonomous*. This is the point where I [part
with
existentialism](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/12/existentialism-is-a-qualitative-individualism/)
and its Augustinian emphasis on choices, will and responsibility. I
think these concepts tend to mislead us, make us think too much in terms
of [decisions rather than
dispositions](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/02/ethics-of-disposition-not-decision/).
Rather, as I think Nietzsche and the Pali Buddhist texts would agree, we
are the product of what has come before us; to the extent we can
understand ourselves to be free, it is because we are able to free
ourselves of the bad influences that plague us for most of our lives,
bad influences that are not only social.

If Buddhism and qualitative individualism can be harmonized, I think
that that harmonizing would do well to start from these commonalities.
But problems remain. Buddhist texts go much further than merely denying
that there is an indivisible, immutable or autonomous self. The suttas
tell us that nothing physical or mental can be regarded as self at all.
They *do* also seem to speak of individual people in a way treated as
unproblematic, but from at least the time of the
[Milindapañhā](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2013/07/the-atomized-buddhist-individual/),
Buddhist texts have told us that this is a merely conventional way of
speaking, not the ultimate truth or reality – at that highest, truest
(*paramattha*) level of reality, selves are *not* real. And this is
treated as important because belief in an ultimate self, a true self, is
viewed as a key source of our craving and therefore our suffering: when
there’s a self, we want more *for it*. If we are to get out of
suffering, we need to divide the apparently true self into its component
pieces, in order to be able to separate the good pieces leading to
nirvana from the bad pieces that continue to entrap us – a separation
that the
[abhidhamma](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/abhi/index.html)
texts theorize and meditators can observe in practice.

So is qualitative individualism then a trap that will merely serve to
mire us in suffering? I think many wise Buddhists throughout the ages
would have said so without hesitation. But I don’t think I agree with
them. At a minimum, I think there is [more to life than the removal of
suffering](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/),
and to say even that much is to make room for extra-Buddhist elements in
a Buddhist worldview, as many Buddhists have done throughout history.
Qualitative individualism is among the elements I find it most important
to bring in. But none of that solves the puzzles discussed above; it
merely articulates what is at stake in bringing them up.
