3:AM interviews on South Asian philosophy UPDATED

Most readers will already be familiar with the deep and entertaining
interviews of the 3:AM Magazine. Here I would like to express my kudos
to Richard Marshall and the 3:AM project for their inclusion of scholars
working on South Asian philosophy within their interviews.  
Unless I missed someone, here is a list of the interviews relevant for
South Asian philosophy (broadly conceived):  

Ramkrishna **Bhattacharya**, speaking of Materialism in India,
[here](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/indian-materialist-philosophy/).  
Nicolas **Bommarito**, speaking of Buddhist ethics and how to appraoch
it, [here](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/buddhist-ethics/).  
William **Endelglass**, speaking of Buddhism, intercultural philosophy
and Levinas,
[here](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/buddhism-and-levinas/).  
Elisa **Freschi**, speaking of epistemology, atheism and deontic logic
in Mīmāṃsā,
