New 3am interview: Elisa Freschi

As I imagine Elisa is unlikely to post about this herself, I draw your
attention to an excellent [interview with her at
3am](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-prabhakara-mima%E1%B9%83sa-school/).
As you might expect, it is scholarly and philosophically sensitive. She
discusses a/theisms, philosophy of language and action, the challenges
of doing philosophy with Sanskrit texts, and more. An excerpt in which
she explains the *apauruṣeya* nature of the Vedas in Mīmāṃsā:

> Their presence is a brute fact, just like the existence of language is
> a brute fact and theories about their origin are much more cumbersome
> than the acceptance of the fact that they exist and that one could not
> imagine a scenario without them. One cannot imagine a scenario without
> language because it is impossible to create a language unless you
> already have linguistic resources (how else would you communicate with
> others about the conventions you want to stipulate?). One cannot
> imagine a scenario without the Vedas because there is no way to invent
> a teaching about our duties out of direct experience, since there is
> no fundamental link between what there is and what ought to be. Human
> beings could not achieve any deontic idea out of the sheer observation
> of the world as it is. The Veda is, therefore, our only access to the
> ought. Either one follows it, or there is no way to know about one’s
> duties.
