Does Śāntideva think bodhisattvas are happy?

A while ago [William
Edelglass](http://brattleborowords.org/staff/william-edelglass-ph-d/)
put up a paper for discussion on academia.edu about Śāntideva and
happiness. I made some suggestions for changes in a way that turned out
to be unhelpful, since William informed me that the paper was already on
its way to publication and he had only put it up by accident! Now,
though, the paper has been published, as a chapter in David McMahan and
Erik Braun’s valuable and readable volume on [meditation, Buddhism and
science](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/meditation-buddhism-and-science-9780190495800?cc=us&lang=en&).
So perhaps now is the time to take my old suggestions and reframe them
here as part of an ongoing public discussion.

William’s purpose in the chapter is to critique what he calls the
“happiness turn” in Western Buddhism, in which Buddhist advocates cite
Buddhism’s ability to make its practitioners happy. The most prominent
such case is [Matthieu
Ricard](https://www.wired.com/2003/09/scientists-meditate-on-happiness/?currentPage=all),
the Tibetan monk whose fMRI scans showed record levels of activity in
the parts of the brain associated with happiness. William thinks this
emphasis on happiness misrepresents significant elements of Buddhism,
and cites Śāntideva at length to prove his case.

Overall, I do not find myself convinced. Perhaps the most problematic
passage in William’s chapter is this one:

> according to Śāntideva, cultivating attention to the experience of
> others, especially attending to their suffering and desires, is far
> more important, and far harder, than cultivating positive affects.
> Interpreting Śāntideva in a contemporary context, we might say that we
> need to cultivate capacities for attending to the other with all her
> differences. We need to cultivate the capacity to attend to those who
> may suffer from deprivation, violence, illness, racism, and
> environmental degradation and to feel the “negative” feelings such
> evils arouse in us. (75-6)

First notice the quick elision of “their suffering and desires” as what
one attends to. A reader unfamiliar with Śāntideva might come to think
that satisfying others’ desires is as important to him from alleviating
their suffering – especially in light of the final sentence. But this is
quite far from Śāntideva’s position. I don’t think Śāntideva identifies
deprivation, violence, illness or caste prejudice (a close premodern
Indian analogue to racism) as primary causes of the other’s suffering –
let alone environmental degradation, a problem he would have had
considerably less reason to thinkabout. Suffering is caused by mental
factors, and material deprivations can actually *help* one address those
factors. (I have developed this point at length in chapters 3-5 of my
[dissertation](http://loveofallwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/lele-dissertation.pdf).)
Śāntideva’s bodhisattva *does* try to satisfy others’ desires – but
solely so that he can [more effectively teach
them](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/18054) how to see those desires
either don’t matter or lead to deeper suffering. And so he is
[anti-political](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/08/on-santidevas-anti-politics/),
a [disengaged
Buddhist](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/04/disengaged-buddhism-in-the-era-of-trump/)
– not least because the “negative feelings” these social ills may arouse
in us include *anger*, the deepest source of suffering.

I think that passage is largely wrong. But there are other passages in
the chapter that, while I also find them potentially misleading, are
considerably more interesting. Most notably there is this one:

> In some circumstances, pleasure, or a positive affect, may indicate a
> lack of compassion or wisdom. Consider Śāntideva’s comment in chapter
> VI: “Just as there is no mental pleasure in all sensual gratification
> whatsoever when one’s body is on fire, likewise there is no way for
> the compassionate ones to be happy when sentient beings are in pain”
> (VI.123). Śāntideva argues that happiness in the face of pain is the
> mark of someone who suffers from mental defilements. (73-4)

The reason I find this misleading is that Śāntideva also says many
things that are quite opposite to it. Śāntideva might have some
objection to being happy in the face of others’ pain, but he identifies
happiness in the face of one’s own pain as the mark of a bodhisattva.
Just a few verses later Śāntideva tells us that one who has *kṣānti* –
the patient endurance that the chapter is advocating – attains the
happiness of an emperor. (VI.134) In chapter XI of the Śikṣā Samuccaya,
he goes considerably further to say how the bodhisattva is happy even
while undergoing gruesome tortures. More generally, when Śāntideva is
more explicitly advocating altruism, in Bodhicaryāvatāra VIII.129, he
tells us that “all who are happy in this world are happy because of
desire for others’ happiness.” William gives that last sentence just a
“see also” in a footnote, but I think it needs more than that in the
face of his other claims. One imagines the bodhisattva is always aware
of others’ pain, yet we still have several passages insisting she is
indeed happy.

From my studies of Śāntideva’s texts, I think remarks like that – that
the bodhisattva is happy – are actually much more frequent than are the
remarks about not being happy when beings are in pain. BCA VI.123, the
verse where others’ pain makes one unhappy, is a more isolated passage
than the others.

And yet – and this is why I think this passage of William’s really is
interesting – verse VI.123 is still *there* in the Bodhicaryāvatāra. It
stands in manifest tension to all the other passages just discussed.
What is it doing there?

At a recent conference – it might have been the 2017 AAR in Boston
–Stephen Harris presented on the Bodhicaryāvatāra’s passages about the
bodhisattva’s happiness, and in the question period I pointed verse
VI.123 out to him. Stephen’s first response was to say that Śāntideva
isn’t as concerned about contradictions as we are. I’m not sure that
that is true, though it perhaps depends on who the “we” is who is
concerned about contradictions and just how concerned it is. Many people
treat Madhyamaka Buddhism as a school that is comfortable with
contradiction, but that really isn’t the case. Candrakīrti, Śāntideva’s
fellow Prāsaṅgika, says:

> Now if, even with the injunction that there is a contradiction
> (*virodha*) with what he has admitted himself, the opponent does not
> back down, then because of his extreme shamelessness, he would still
> not withdraw even with \[a further\] reason or example. And we do not
> debate with a madman (*unmattaka*). (Prasannapadā 15-3-16.2)

I am convinced that it is a poor reading strategy to shrug one’s
shoulders and say “meh, he contradicts himself.” If one is trying to
learn from a great thinker like Śāntideva, I think it’s essential to
follow [Thomas Kuhn’s
advice](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/looking-for-coherent-authorship/)
and view contradictions in the text as a problem. That was the approach
I took in my dissertation: I noted Śāntideva both says material goods
are harmful and urges one to give them to others for their own benefit,
and asked how he could say both of these things *without* contradicting
himself. The answer led me to what I think is the dissertation’s most
important new insight, summarized in my [2013 JBE
article](http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2013/11/14/santideva-on-gifts-altruism-and-poverty/):
that the gift-giving is intended for teaching purposes, not for material
benefit. As I understand it, Kuhn developed his own great insights by
reading Aristotle’s Physics in this way.

And what I see in the passages mentioned in this blog is an *apparent*
contradiction, what [Kuhn would
call](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2010/09/looking-for-coherent-authorship/)
the “apparent absurdities” in the text. I think Śāntideva had reasons
for what *appears* like both denying and affirming the bodhisattva’s
happiness. I don’t yet know what they are, but I bet they would make a
great topic for someone else’s dissertation.
