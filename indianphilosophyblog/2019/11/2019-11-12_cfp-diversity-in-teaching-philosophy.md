CfP: Diversity in teaching philosophy

I received the following call for papers from Monika
Kirloskar-Steinbach. Since I guess we all have direct experience with
the topic, please consider applying.

The American Association of Philosophy Teachers is a community of
faculty, teachers, and grad students who are passionate about teaching
and learning in philosophy, and every two years we have a conference
with sessions focused entirely on that. Sessions are interactive and
hands on, and a great way to connect with colleagues who enjoy talking
and sharing ideas about teaching.

We are inviting proposals for our 2020 workshop/conference, to be held
at Otterbein University (Ohio, USA) July 22-25, 2020. Please see the
CfP. Proposals due January 17, 2020.

We are interested in proposals in all areas of teaching and learning in
philosophy, though are particularly interested in (among other things):

    Teaching in non-traditional settings
    Professional issues connected to teaching
    Diversity and Inclusion in our classrooms and discipline
    “High-impact diversity practices” in teaching philosophy courses

Questions can be sent to Christina Hendricks
(christina.hendricks@ubc.ca) or to the Program Chair, Jane Drexler
(jane.drexler@slcc.edu).
