Update: Yale-NUS Hiring

An update on the endowed chair position in “Non-Western philosophy” at
Yale-NUS, mentioned in this [previous
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2019/10/04/endowed-chair-in-philosophy-yale-nus-college/).
The position is for senior faculty, but I understand that associate
professors (or equivalent) who could be promoted to full professor
should apply. I would also note that the position is for “continuing or
permanent,” so applicants who may not wish to commit to staying on
permanently in Singapore also should consider applying. I’m happy to
answer those questions I can in comments or by email.

The initial deadline for submission of materials is 25 November 2019.
