The role of the prescription to teach the Veda according to Prabhākara

If you are a Prābhākara, you think that students don’t have to learn the
Veda and that they actually do it because of the teachers’ duty to teach
it. This certainly solves the problem of having a young boy (younger
than 8) deciding to study the Veda based on an analysis of the benefits
he will get out of this study. Does this also solve the problem of
whether one should study also Mīmāṃsā?

In other words, assuming that one learns the Veda due to the
prescription to teach it, does this prescription include the duty to
teach the meaning? No, says Veṅkaṭanātha in his refutation of the
Prābhākara position. Just like the knowledge of the meaning of the Veda
is no included in the prescription to learn it by heart, so it is not
included in the prescription to teach it. Both stop their function at
the Vedic phonemes.

So far so good, but then Veṅkaṭanātha adds an additional reason why the
prescription to teach does not reach until the meaning of the Veda,
namely:

> अबाधितप्रत्ययोत्पत्तावनपेक्षत्वलक्षणप्रामाण्यस्य वक्ष्यमाणत्वाच्च
>
> And because in the case of the coming into being of a cognition which
> has not been invalidated, we will say that its validity (prāmāṇya)
> consists in its being independent. (SM ad 1.1.1, 1971 p. 27)

The reference is clearly to PMS 1.1.5, where the Veda is said to be a
pramāṇa because it is independent from any other source. That is, once a
cognition has indeed come into being and is not sublated, the only thing
which could make one doubt about it is its having the wrong source, but
if it is independent on any source, no such worry can arise. Why is this
said here? Perhaps because a cognition of the meaning does indeed take
place upon learning the Veda by heart and unless one can prove that it
is wrong, one needs to consider it valid. Hence, the need to study
Mīmāṃsā cannot be justified on the basis of the need to understand the
meaning of the Veda.
