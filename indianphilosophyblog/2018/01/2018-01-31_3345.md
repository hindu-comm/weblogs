Words are arrows

[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8c-P7TmRHwc/Wm_hInYXweI/AAAAAAAAFSg/UhZ6BmoxmA8o8Blf2W-c5KAu-vSOXK9WACLcBGAs/s1600/arrow.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8c-P7TmRHwc/Wm_hInYXweI/AAAAAAAAFSg/UhZ6BmoxmA8o8Blf2W-c5KAu-vSOXK9WACLcBGAs/s1600/arrow.jpg)One
image I’ve encountered in Sanskrit texts on language is that of the
arrow standing in for the capacity of words. I think the first time (in
secondary literature) I saw this was in K.K. Raja’s *Indian Theories of
Meaning,* when he refers to Abhinavagupta’s characterization of the
Prābhākara theory of sentence meaning (*anvitābhidhāna*). Raja says:

> Abhinavagupta refers to this theory as the *dīrgha-vyāpāravāda*, since
> according to the *anvitābhidhāna* theory there is no limit to the
> extent of the meaning that an expression can convey. Just as the range
> of an arrow is not limited, but varies with the difference in the
> power with which it is discharged, so also the range of *abhidhā* or
> the expressive power can be extended farther and farther (Raja 1969,
> 199-200).

The section in Abhinavagupta’s *Locana* says:

> यो ऽप्यन्विताभिधानवादी यत्परः शब्दः स शब्दार्थः इति हृदये ग्रहीत्वा
> शरवदभिधाव्यापारमेव दीर्घदीर्घभिच्छति तस्य यदि दीर्घो व्यापारस्तदेको
> ऽसाविति कुतः । (Śāstrī 1940, 64, lines 2-3)

> Now the school of *anvitābhidhāna* holds dearly to the doctrine that
> “the word’s meaning is that to which the word \[finally\] leads,” and
> would have it that the denotative operation continues longer and
> longer, like the course of an arrow (*śara*). We ask them: if the
> operation continues so long, how can it be one, for its objects will
> be various? (Ingalls et al 1990, 89)

Here Abhinavagupta, in defending the existence of *dhvani* from the
reductionist threat of Prābhākara thinkers, argues that unlike an arrow,
which has one object (the target), the denotative operation
(*abhidhāvyāpara*) has multiple. So this is not a fair analogy.

This way of characterizing the Prābhākara view, as an arrow with a
“longer and longer operation” (*dīrghadhīrgavyāpara*) is also found
earlier in Jayanta Bhaṭṭa’s *Nyāyamañjarī*:

> वाक्यस्य
> दूराविदूरव्यवस्थितगुणागुणक्रियाद्यनेककारककलकापोपरक्तकार्यात्मकवाक्यार्थप्रतीतौ
> इषोरिव दीर्घदीर्घो व्यापारः । (Vidvan 1969, 124, lines 4-6)

> As an arrow (*iṣu*) has a short or long process, i.e., it hits a near
> or remote object or it pierces and passes through a thin or thick
> object quickly or slowly, so a sentence quickly or slowly conveys its
> meaning since the knowledge of the complete meaning depends upon a
> group of factors, viz, the knowledge of the meanings of words denoting
> qualities, substances, action, etc. (Bhattacarya 1978, 93-94)

Jayanta is presenting a Prābhākara retort to the putative *pramāṇa* of
*śrutārthāpatti*, postulation of what is heard. The idea is that there
is no need to postulate anything to complete incomplete sentences, but
the words in an otherwise incomplete expression continue to function
until he entire meaning is understood. Jayanta will argue that, in fact,
some unheard words are responsible for conveying meaning, not just those
words that are heard (here he appeals to *lopa* in grammatical contexts
which still have semantic efficacy). This use of the arrow image relies
not just on the length of its range, but also its speed, which implies
the phenomenological experience of understanding words.

V. K. Chari says that *dīrghadīrghavyāpāra* is found in the *Mahābhāṣya*
(Chari 262, fn 33) but while roots of the idea may be found there, I
could not find the analogy of the arrow in connection with it (perhaps I
am just missing it, though).

We can also see Vācaspati in his *Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā* discussing
the comprehension of words in terms of an arrow, although his point
seems to be different–in fact, the opposite!

> प्रयोगप्राचुर्याद अत्यन्ताभ्यासेनातिशीघ्रतया सन्न् अपि प्रत्ययक्रमो न
> लक्ष्यते शीघ्रतरबाणहेतुकशतपत्रशतव्यतिभेदवद् इति चेत । न । … (Thakur
> 1996, 435, lines 9-10)

> Suppose you say: due to the profuse number of such uses, since they
> are very common and occur so fast, \[secondary meaning understood from
> the primary meaning\], although it is a sequential awareness, it is
> not recognized as such–just like the explosive appearance of hundreds
> of feathers caused by hundreds of the fastest arrows (*bāṇa*). (We
> reply) no…

Here, Vācaspati is discussing the speed with which we understand the
secondary meaning from the primary meaning, such as when someone says
“The village is on the Ganges” and we immediately understand them to
mean it is on the *bank* of the Ganges. This illustration is meant to be
a counterexample to his claim that the primary meaning of a word is (as
Gautama says) the individual, the shape, and the universal altogether.
The objector claims that, as with the move from primary to secondary
meaning, so in the case of the primary meaning of a word (a universal)
which is then understood as its context-specific sense (say, a
particular individual), these distinct stages that are just too rapid
for us to disambiguate.

Of course, comparing arrows to speech is not just a philosophical
occurrence–it’s a trope in poetry, as in the *Mahābhārata* (and
elsewhere)

> वाकसायका वदनान निष्पतन्ति; यैर आहतः शॊचति रार्त्य अहानि
>
> परस्य वा मर्मसु ये पतन्ति; तान पण्डितॊ नावसृजेत परेषु *(online edition
> at [sacred-texts.com
> link](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs01082.htm))*

> The man hurt by the arrows (*sāyaka*) of cruel speech hurled from
> one’s lips, weepeth day and night. Indeed, these strike at the core of
> the body. Therefore the wise never fling these arrows at others.
> ([Ganguli translation
> online](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01088.htm))

Here, though, the image emphasizes the result of the arrows–their
painful effect, in contrast to the earlier analogies focusing on the
arrow’s changeable range (in the Prābhākara case discussed by
Abhinavagupta and Jayanta Bhaṭṭa) or its rapidity (in Vācaspati’s use).
I am not sure, but I wonder if Vācaspati is talking about a very large
bow from which many arrows could be shot at a single time (rather than a
flurry from a group of archers)–though one hundred may be too many for
that!

I’m trying to collect these instances as they occur as examples of
philosophical methodology that involves “figurative language” (where
it’s an open question how precisely to characterize what’s going on).
What’s interesting, too, is that they all use different words for
“arrow,” so it suggests that the image–and maybe not an original
maxim–is what unites the uses (though this is very tentative). Are there
others you would add to the list? Further, has someone already written
on this theme (arrows as words in philosophy) and I’ve just missed it?
(Somewhat relatedly, there is a recent [paper in *Dao* by Rina Marie
Camus](https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjf4-6WvYHZAhUFp48KHewkAU8QFggnMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11712-017-9545-y&usg=AOvVaw23oYUfmT6qwMYVp4I4YukY)
with r[esponse by Edward
Slingerland](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11712-017-9565-7)
that takes up the theme of archery as metaphor in Confucius and
Aristotle.)
