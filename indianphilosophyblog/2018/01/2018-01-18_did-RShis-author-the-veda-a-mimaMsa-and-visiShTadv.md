Did ṛṣis author the Veda? A Mīmāṃsā and Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta view about it

In his *Seśvaramīmāṃsā* (ad 1.1.29), Veṅkaṭanātha discusses the problem
of the authorship of the Veda while being a Mīmāṃsaka, but also trying
to condede something to theism.

For instance, he is less straightforward than Mīmāṃsā authors in ruling
out the role of the ṛṣis. Mīmāṃsā authors spoke of the ṛṣis mentioned in
connection with some Vedic parts as having just recited (and not
authored) those parts in an excellent way. Veṅkaṭanātha does not deny
his opponent’s claim that ṛṣis could see parts of the Veda they did not
learn with a teacher. Nonetheless, they only see what they are eligible
to see, through powers given to them by Prajāpati. They also don’t see
anything new:

> For this very reason, also the fact that the ṛṣis have done the
> sūtras, the \[Vedic\] parts (*kāṇḍa*) (Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣads) and the
> mantras (i.e., the Vedic saṃhitās), conforms to previous acts (i.e.,
> they have uttered them as they were in the previous kalpa), \[and\]
> the immediate perception (*sākṣatkaraṇa*) of a part of the Veda which
> has not been studied \[by them\] by ṛṣis who had specific powers given
> \[to them\] by Prajāpati conforms with their various eligibilities.

> anadhītavedabhāgasākṣātkaraṇam eva. tad evaṃ na vedakarteti sarvadā
> paratantrapuruṣaparamparādhītā eva vedāḥ.

In other words, ṛṣis are an exception to the normal transmission of the
Veda, they are not at its origin. And they don’t see anything more than
what people learn through their teachers.

Now a question to you, dear readers: **I am not sure about my
interpretation of the compound *sūtrakāṇḍamantrakṛttvam*.** This is
found in the same context also in Veṅkaṭanātha’s *Nyāyapariśuddhi*, but
I could not find it in any other text. I am not sure about its meaning,
since the Vedic kāṇḍas (karmakāṇḍa and jñānakāṇḍa) do include mantras.
Nor did Veṅkaṭanātha mention here mantras of altogether different
origin… Moreover, sūtras are generally accepted to have an author, so
that they don’t really belong to the same group. **What could be meant
here?**
