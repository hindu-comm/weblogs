Eastern APA Submissions in Asian Philosophy

From [Warp, Weft, and
Way](http://warpweftandway.com/appeal-for-eastern-apa-submissions/)â€“I
imagine that the same remarks would apply to philosophers here reading
the Indian Philosophy Blog, so I quote in full. Note that the deadline
for submission is 15 February 2018.

> Hello, fellow philosophers! This is my second year on the Program
> Committee for the Eastern Division APA, and I want to **strongly**
> encourage philosophers working on Asian traditions to [submit
> 3000-5000 word papers for the 2019 Eastern
> APA](http://www.apaonline.org/page/papersubmission), which will be
> held in New York City. I was surprised last year by the low number of
> Asian papers that I saw while serving on the Program Committee and I
> am sure more submissions would be warmly welcomed by everyone
> involved.
>
> I am only speaking for myself, and not the APA or the rest of the
> people involved in the process, but I believe publishing philosophers
> working on Asian traditions and figures will have a very solid chance
> of acceptance if they submit a paper, especially one that contributes
> to an on-going debate. Like many of you, I would be excited to see
> more papers of this sort on the main program so that philosophers who
> do not work on Asian philosophy can come to appreciate the complexity
> of the ideas and debates in the field. Please consider working up a
> short paper to submit [to the on-line
> system](http://www.apaonline.org/general/custom.asp?page=submit_instruct),
> which is now open!
