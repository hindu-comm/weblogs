Sanskrit Reading Room at Soas (London)

I received the following announcement from Karen O’Brien-Kop and I am
glad to advertise it, also because several readings will be conducted by
long-term colleagues and friends of mine, including also “our” Alex
Watson. You can read Karen’s very interesting posts about the reading
sessions on her [blog](https://sanskritreadingroom.wordpress.com/).

The Sanskrit Reading Room at SOAS is a graduate initiative that holds
fortnightly readings of Sanskrit texts with leading scholars. This year
we are looking at a number of texts from the Indian philosophical
traditions. The reading seminars are open to all, although knowledge of
Sanskrit is recommended. Participants can book their place in advance
and will receive the reading in order to familiarize themselves with the
text. Selected sessions will be live-streamed via our Facebook page and
all sessions will be recorded for an audio archive on our
[blog](https://sanskritreadingroom.wordpress.com/).

Facebook group: Sanskrit Reading Room. Contact:
