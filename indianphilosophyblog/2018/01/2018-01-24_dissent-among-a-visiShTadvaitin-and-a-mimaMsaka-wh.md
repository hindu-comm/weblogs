Dissent among a Viśiṣṭādvaitin and a Mīmāṃsaka: What do Vedic words mean?

Within his Mīmāṃsā commentary, the *Seśvaramīmāṃsā*, Veṅkaṭanātha
explicitly dissents from Śabara (also) in his commentary on Pūrva
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra (henceforth PMS) 1.1.31 on Vedic words seemingly
expressing proper names, e.g., Prāvāhaṇi and Babara (which are used by
opponents as an evidence of the impermanent nature of the Vedas).

Śabara suggested that such seeming names in fact only express something
else and offered alternative etymological explanations. Veṅkaṭanātha
replies that out of context it is clear that specific people must be
referred to, but that these people’s roles are recurrently covered at
each new era.

The relevant passage by Śabara on PMS 1.1.31 reads:

> \[The name\] ”Prāvāhaṇi” derives from \`flowing forth’ (*pravah*-).
> \[The name\] ”Babara” imitates a sound. Therefore, these two
> \[linguistic expressions\] express only a permanent referent (artha).
> Therefore it is said \\textbf{The other \[ephemeral things mentioned
> in the Vedas\], by contrast, are merely similar in the way they sound.
>
> pravāhayati, sa prāvāhaṇiḥ. babara iti śabdānukṛtiḥ. tena yo
> nityārthas tam evaitau śabdau vadiṣyataḥ. ata uktam – paraṃ tu
> śrutisāmānyamātram iti

Veṅkaṭanātha’s rejection of this view reads as follows:

> Only Half-Materialists (ardhacārvāka) like this construction (yojanā)
> \[of the sūtra\]. Otherwise, how could \[such meanings\] be connected
> (anvaya) with \[linguistic expressions such as\] ”he desired”? (How
> could ”Babara” be connected with ”he desired” if it is only an
> onomatopoeia?)
>
> \[Obj./in favour of Śabara:\] Also in regard to that (”he desired”)
> one postulates a different meaning.
>
> \[R.:\] Why should not \[a different menaning\] be postulated in this
> way in every case?

All four manuscripts of the *Seśvaramīmāṃsā* reproduce Śabara’s passage
in a slightly different way, including a reference to vāyu as a referent
of Prāvāhaṇi:

> \[The name\] ”Prāvāhaṇi” derives from \`flowing forth’ (*pravah*-).
> \[The name\] ”Babara” imitates a sound. Therefore, these two
> linguistic expressions express only a permanent referent (artha),
> \[i.e.\], the wind (which flows forth).
>
> pravāhayati iti prāvāhaṇiḥ. babara iti śabdānukṛtiḥ. tena yo nityo
> ‘rthas tam imau śabdau vadiṣyataḥ *vāyum*. ata uktam – paraṃ tu
> śrutisāmānyamātram iti

The mention of vāyu is not present in the published version of the
*Śābarabhāṣya*. Nonetheless, the reference to the wind is well-attested
in the Mīmāṃsā subcommentaries on this *adhikaraṇa*, thus Veṅkaṭanātha
could easily be aware of it.
