12th Nalanda dialogue on Perception

The dates of the next Nalanda dialogue are: February the 22nd ton 24th.

I recently received the following announcement about it (unedited):

We are happy to announce that the 12th Dialog on Perception is going to
be held from 22nd to 24th of February’ 2018 in Navanalanda Mahavihara ‘
Nalanda . As we had been trying during the past Dialogs ( please visit
the Past Dialog section of www.nalandadialogmission.wordpress.com), this
meeting is also intended to open Dialog between Science and Philosophy.
This time we will concentrate on different aspects of perception – about
different epistemological and logical issues involved in the passage
from perception to knowledge formation. Particular interest will be paid
on the way theoretical concepts are formed within the framework of
mathematical language on the basis of observed/ perceived data.  
However, one of the most pressing impressions left during the past
Dialogs is about an acute difficulty – we often fail to address point
blank the question that what precisely constitute the problem area which
really calls for multiple inputs from different disciplines! In fact
scientific disciplines, though presuppose a philosophy, in one way or
another, are internally autonomous to a great extent. Practical bread
and butter problems in science are strongly believed to be taken
adequate care from within the framework of their own technical Languages
so far developed, or which is possible to be developed , in principle ,
on the basis of the existing language itself – modifying or extending
accordingly.  
What then is exactly the reference area in the existing body of
scientific knowledge to seek help from domains outside, which belong
technically and pedagogically to other disciplines ! What specifically
are the epistemological difficulties involved in the process of
scientific knowledge formation which can be made more sense by
‘philosophical’ solicitation?  
As we know that there are a stable body of Answers (though differs over
a wide spectrum of opinions!) to this question in context of Western
knowledge dynamics.  
But this question is far more difficult to answer if asked in context of
Indian knowledge dynamics for obvious reasons internal to the different
cultural dynamics. We have hardly any good reason to single out any
given slot of period out of the huge time span through which Indian
knowledge dynamics developed which can be of better help to answer this
question compared to others. Apart from pointing out some surface
analogies, we are hardly better yet in assessing this question even from
rigorous historical point of view of knowledge dynamics in Indian
context.  
In fact this is the question we are trying to make sense during the last
few Dialogs. However, one of the significant lessons of History of Ideas
in general and science in particular is that , a large portion of
philosopher’s typical concerns , which has been usually debated so far
inconclusively can be formulated further to figure out Answers .  
Of course Humanity is faced with a vast number of problems which can’t
be solved quickly enough in terms of definite Answers to guide our
actions and decisions. But still an impressive variety of problem areas
of traditional philosophical concerns are there which can be further
translated in modern terms to expect Answers ( at least better empirical
justification )of large varieties instead of inconclusive debate .  
During the past 2/3 years we have been able to figure out areas of
mutual concerns which really offers further formulation which are even
at the disposal of experimental verification . Many problems of
traditional philosophical concerns are now at the disposal of empirical
verification leading to a subject area described sometimes as
experimental metaphysics .  
However, experimental metaphysics is still an aim which is largely
envisaged in context of the Realism issue pertaining to quantum
mechanics.  
Nalanda mission in its present stage hopes to extend the scope of the
experimental metaphysics to include traditional Indian philosophical
concerns.  
An impressive variety if of issues had already been singled out which
can be further translated tro look for better interdisciplinary norms of
comparison within empirical framework . Some of the issues are –  
1. Identity and Individuation
2. Free Will
3. Metaphysics of Relation
..  
12th Nalanda Dialog hopes to add more to this list or at least to add
variation to the existing list.
