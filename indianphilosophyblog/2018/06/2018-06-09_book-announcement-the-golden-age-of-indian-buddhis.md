Book announcement: The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy by Jan Westerhoff

Jan Westerhoff: The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy (The Oxford
History of Philosophy), Oxford University Press, 352 pages,
978-0198732662

From the publisher: Jan Westerhoff unfolds the story of one of the
richest episodes in the history of Indian thought, the development of
Buddhist philosophy in the first millennium CE. He starts from the
composition of the Abhidharma works before the beginning of the common
era and continues up to the time of Dharmakirti in the sixth century.
This period was characterized by the development of a variety of
philosophical schools and approaches that have shaped Buddhist thought
up to the present day: the scholasticism of the Abhidharma, the
Madhyamakaâ€™s theory of emptiness, Yogacara idealism, and the logical and
epistemological works of Dinnaga and Dharmakirti. The book attempts to
describe the historical development of these schools in their
intellectual and cultural context, with particular emphasis on three
factors that shaped the development of Buddhist philosophical thought:
the need to spell out the contents of canonical texts, the discourses of
the historical Buddha and the Mahayana sutras; the desire to defend
their positions by sophisticated arguments against criticisms from
fellow Buddhists and from non-Buddhist thinkers of classical Indian
philosophy; and the need to account for insights gained through the
application of specific meditative techniques. While the main focus is
the period up to the sixth century CE, Westerhoff also discusses some
important thinkers who influenced Buddhist thought between this time and
the decline of Buddhist scholastic philosophy in India at the beginning
of the thirteenth century. His aim is that the historical presentation
will also allow the reader to get a better systematic grasp of key
Buddhist concepts such as non-self, suffering, reincarnation, karma, and
nirvana.
