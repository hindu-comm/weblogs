Job Opening at San Jose State University

Dear Friends

San Jose State University is hiring a TT assistant professor with an AOS
in the History of Philosophy. The position is open to any period and any
culture or tradition. So, if you are interested in coming to San Jose
State and working with the Center for Comparative Philosophy please
apply. We have a really pluralistic department that ranges from
philosophy of science to feminism and Chinese, Indian, and Mexican
Philosophy. And we celebrate both continental and analytic approaches in
western philosophy.
