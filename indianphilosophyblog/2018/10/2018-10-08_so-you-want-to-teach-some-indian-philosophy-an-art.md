So You Want to Teach Some Indian Philosophy? An article on the APA blog by Jonardon Ganeri

From the APA’s blog:

> In a previous post,[Peter
> Adamson](https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/09/03/so-you-want-to-teach-some-islamic-philosophy/)predicted
> that non-European philosophies are destined to enter the mainstream of
> the philosophical profession. He highlighted three avenues of
> progress. One is that departments will hire more experts, people who
> know the relevant languages, have studied the histories and cultural
> contexts, and can offer high-level graduate training in the subject.
> Another is that non-experts will, thanks to the availability of ever
> better texts in translation, begin to offer courses in non-European
> philosophies, such courses serving perfectly adequately in introducing
> students to a wide range of profoundly inspiring and fascinating
> ideas. The third avenue, and the one that his post and this one are
> intended to encourage, is that materials from non-European
> philosophies will find a place within the curricula of thematically
> organised courses. A person offering a course on scepticism, for
> example, might find themselves wanting to bring in ideas from a range
> of non-European epistemologists, rather than represent the subject as
> being something only European. If the case can be made even for
> allegedly “core” subjects like epistemology, metaphysics, logic, and
> philosophy of language, it’s even more persuasive to make it for moral
> philosophy, aesthetics, and political philosophy. What we offer, in
> Peter’s earlier post about Islamic philosophy and in my post about
> Indian philosophy, are suggestions of primary and secondary
> literature, accessible to any tutor who wants to bring a greater range
> of voices to the table than is currently typical.
