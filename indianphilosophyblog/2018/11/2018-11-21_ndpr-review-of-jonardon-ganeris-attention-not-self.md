NDPR review of Jonardon Ganeri’s Attention, Not Self

Review bySebastian Watzl, University of Oslo

> Why should we study the philosophical ideas of someone who lived many
> centuries ago, in a far-away part of the world, and in a highly
> different cultural context? One reason is to expand one’s
> philosophical horizon: to move beyond the narrow confinements of one’s
> own little neighborhood of the vast philosophical city (Priest 2011),
> and thus to approach the contemporary philosophical scene with newly
> gained humility on account of its limitations.
>
> One educated in contemporary cognitive science and philosophy may have
> expected in Jonardon Ganeri’s book a confrontation with such a
> marvelously strange new neighborhood. It is, after all, a book largely
> on the philosophical ideas of the 6^(th)century Indian philosopher
> Buddhaghosa, writing in the Pāli language in the Theravāda Buddhist
> tradition. As read by Ganeri, Buddhaghosa’s account of the mind, by
> contrast, is often strikingly familiar. Buddhaghosa comes across as
> stunningly modern, with a picture of the mind that meshes closely with
> the latest empirical studies in cognitive science and the latest
> discussions in the philosophy of mind. Ganeri’s book thus practices
> the “philosophy without borders” he advocates in the book’s
> postscript: it aims “to discover a fundamental theory true of the
> human mind as such” by considering “theories from a plurality of
> cultural locations.” (341)
>
> Ganeri provides a substantial and novel account of the human mind by
> drawing on the “rich theoretical vocabulary” in the Pāli tradition,
> that is then “transformed . . . with the assistance of tools,
> techniques, and empirical findings from the cognitive sciences.” (347)
> The book is both an independent theory of the mind and an
> interpretation and textual analysis of Buddhaghosa’s writings. While
> some parts of Ganeri’s book mostly show that Buddhaghosa’s view fits
> the picture we get from cognitive science, the last part links some of
> that detailed investigation of mental processes in novel ways to
> broader questions about what it means to be human. The resulting
> picture is rich and interesting, and Ganeri’s writing is fluent and
> engaging.
