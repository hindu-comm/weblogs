British Journal of History of Philosophy and “Non-Western” Philosophy

Via [Warp, Weft, and
Way](http://warpweftandway.com/bjhp-welcomes-non-western-philosophy/),
from the editor of [*British Journal of History of
Philosophy*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09608788.2018.1423735)
on its 25th anniversary (bolding is mine):

> As we move forward, what we would like to promote, above all, is more
> work on non-Western philosophy, **especially where it seeks to deepen
> dialogue between the various traditions through critical engagement
> and fruitful comparison**. So here, in particular, we would like to
> underline that we welcome submissions that discuss non-Western
> philosophy even if our record to date might suggest otherwise.

Granted, not everyone’s work, as we have discussed numerous times here,
easily fits into “history of philosophy,” but given that BJHP is
explicitly focusing on critical engagement and fruitful comparison, this
announcement could be helpful for a wide range of methodologies.
