Is there a Sanskrit word for “intelligence” (or any other word)?

The problem with such questions (I do not know about you, but I often
receive them), is that they are based on an atomic concept of sentences,
as if there were a 1:1 correspondence among concepts and words and among
language 1 and language 2. This theory has long been superseded both in
linguistics (see Saussure’s discussion of how not even “tree” can be
easily translated) and in translation theories. Moreover, as a scholar
of Mīmāṃsā, I tend to imagine that the contribution of each word in a
sentence is at least also a result of the contributions of the other
words in the same sentence.

Thus, at least in case of philosophical concepts, one cannot focus on a
single term, i.e., on a “dictionary approach”, but rather on what
Umberto Eco calls the encyclopedic approach, i.e., offering a broader
definition instead of a 1:1 translation. Moreover, each discussion of a
(European) philosophical term needs to be preceded by an analysis of the
term itself. Ideally, one should reconstruct it, too, through an
encyclopedic approach (what does “X” entail? in which contexts is it
used?).

In the case of “intelligence”, *prajñā* (not *prajñāna*) is often used,
even more so in Mahāyāna texts, for “wisdom”, it can mean also
“discrimination” and can therefore be compared to “intelligence”. I
would, however, rather suggest *buddhi*, which stands for one’s ability
to engage intellectually, especially because it does not have the
sapiential aspect of *prajñā* and because *buddhimat* \`having *buddhi*‘
can often be used in contexts in which in English one would speak of
“intelligent” people. Another possibility would be *prekṣā*, again
because of the use of *prekṣāvat* in order to define people who are able
to consider things before deliberating.

**What do readers think? How do you conceive “intelligence” in
Sanskrit?**
