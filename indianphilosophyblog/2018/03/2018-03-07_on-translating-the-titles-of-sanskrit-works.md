On translating the titles of Sanskrit works

I gave some more thoughts to the topic of whether we should translate
the titles of Sanskrit works.  
As you might remember, braodly speaking, many of our US colleagues
started translating them and most of our Japanese, Indian and European
colleagues just leave the Sanskrit titles as they are.

I basically have two problems with the translations:

1.  the English titles might be too vague (“Commentary”) or misleading
    (“Maxims”, suggesting the enunciation of a moral truth, not to speak
    of “Mirrors”, “Amulets”, “Rising Moons” and the like)
2.  there is no standardised translation (I know that here some
    colleagues might suggest to just follow Sheldon Pollock’s one, but
    even they will have to agree that *sūtra* is more often translated
    as “Aphorisms” than as “Maxims”), so that readers of article a, b
    and c might think that their authors are talking about different
    texts.

Thus, I see **no point** in translating titles in case of articles of
books targeted at Sanskritists. For a Sanskritist like me, a title like
“Versed Commentary” just forces me to wonder what is meant, whether
*Ślokavārttika* immediately rings a bell. Nor do we want to have our PhD
students learn English titles instead of Sanskrit ones, I believe, since
if they did so they would have more troubles reading actual Sanskrit
texts.

However, I also understand the advantage of translating Sanskrit titles
in English **in articles or books aiming at non-Sanskritists**, which at
least give some idea (though vague or misleading) and might be more
easily memorised by lay readers. Hence, what about the following:

-   we use a translation which is slightly more specific, e.g. (Pūrva)
    Mīmāṃsā Sūtra = “Maxims (or Aphorisms) on Vedic Exegesis” or
    “Exegetic Maxims (or Aphorisms)”.
-   we explain in the first footnote about the texts whose titles should
    be translated, e.g., PMS and ŚBh, something like “The title
    *Mīmāṃsāsūtra* has been differently translated. In general, it
    states that the text is about Mīmāṃsā, i.e., about an investigation
    on Vedic texts, and that it is composed in short, syntetic and terse
    sentences, called *sūtra*s. These are often hardly understandable
    without an extended commentary, and *bhāṣya* means indeed ‘extended
    commentary’. For pragmatic reasons, in the following we will refer
    to these texts with an English translation, i.e., as “Exegetic
    Maxims” and “Commentary on the Exegetic Maxims” respectively.”
