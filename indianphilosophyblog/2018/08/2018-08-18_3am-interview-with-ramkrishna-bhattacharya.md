[3](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/hindu-syllogisms-and-dark-necessities-go-fusion/))
of interviews of philosophers working in Indian thought, in an interview
with [Ramkrishna
Bhattacharya](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/indian-materialist-philosophy/)
(at the [Pavlov Institute,
Kolkata](http://www.pavlovinstitutekolkata.org/contact.php)) about his
work on Cārvāka. In this interview, Bhattacharya discusses the history
of Cārvāka/Lokāyata and his understanding of their philosophy and its
reception. For instance, he explains why Udbhaṭabhaṭṭa represents
Cārvāka as a dualist system, and not a materialistic monism:

> Of all the commentators so far known to us, Udbhaṭabhaṭṭa alone takes
> such a ‘revisionist’ stand. Other commentators apparently followed the
> *Cārvākasūtra* itself as redacted most probably by Purandara and
> remained staunchly monistic. So we can safely ignore Udbhaṭa’s
> somewhat strange reinterpretations of the aphorisms, particularly on
> that of matter and consciousness. Udbhaṭa exhibits his propensity
> towards dualism which is contradicted by the aphorism, ‘Earth, water,
> fire and air are the principles, nothing else’(I.2). The dissident
> voice of Udbhaṭa should not mislead us, given the fact that he often
> misinterprets words in the aphorism itself.

He also addresses why he thinks that Buddhism, unlike Cārvāka, has
gained the attention of contemporary materialists:

> Buddhism after all is a religion, although it has no God or gods, no
> sacred book like the Veda to be accepted as an inerrant guide, no
> caste system and yet it does not deny the Other World and rebirth. On
> the contrary, the Cārvāka/Lokāyata is uncompromisingly anti-religion
> and denier of the Other World and rebirth. Unless and until one is
> firmly convinced as an uncompromising materialist, the
> Cārvāka/Lokāyata cannot appeal to him or her.
>
> Secondly, Buddhism offers a hope of liberation, *nirvāṇa*, getting out
> of the cycle of birth and rebirth, with suffering accompanying every
> birth. On the other hand, materialism has nothing to offer but the
> naked truth that consciousness dies as soon as the body is dead;
> therefore, there is no question of either liberation or rebirth. The
> hope for living forever in heaven is not there. Buddhism in this
> respect offers a middle way between traditional Hinduism and the
> Cārvāka/Lokāyata.
