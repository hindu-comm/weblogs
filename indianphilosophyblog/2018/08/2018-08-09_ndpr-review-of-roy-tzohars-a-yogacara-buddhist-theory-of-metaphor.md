NDPR Review of Roy Tzohar’s A Yogācāra Buddhist Theory of Metaphor

Review by our own contributor Malcolm Keating.

> Indian philosophy has a history of sophisticated linguistic analysis
> (Pāṇini’s grammar being the usual example), which includes theories of
> reference, polysemy, ellipsis, sentential unity, figurative language,
> and more. Roy Tzohar’s*A Yogācāra Buddhist Theory of Metaphor*is a
> sustained argument for attending both to the intertextual nature of
> Indian philosophy and to the philosophical importance of topics such
> as metaphor and figurative language. Tzohar’s central thesis is that
> Sthiramati, a second- or third-century CE Indian Buddhist thinker, has
> a theory of metaphor (“metaphor” being Tzohar’s preferred translation
> of the Sanskrit*upacāra*) which can be understood more broadly as a
> theory of meaning.
