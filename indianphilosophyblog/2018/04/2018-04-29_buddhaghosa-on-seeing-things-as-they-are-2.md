Buddhaghosa on seeing things as they are (2)

I continue my [argument from last
time](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/04/buddhaghosa-on-seeing-things-as-they-are-1)
dissenting from Maria Heim and Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad’s interpretation
of Buddhaghosa. I turn to a second passage that Heim and Ram-Prasad use
– incorrectly, in my view – to claim Buddhaghosa is not trying to take a
position on the way things actually are. They note correctly that
Buddhaghosa contrasts those who see correctly, one one hand, with those
who “resort to views” (the *diṭṭhigata*) on the other. But what does
this distinction mean, exactly?

Buddhaghosa quotes the Buddha as follows:

> Here the Bhagavan said: “some gods and humans are obsessed by two ways
> of resorting to views: some hold back, some overreach, and only those
> with eyes see. And how, monks, do some hold back? Monks, gods and
> humans delight in being (or becoming), are intent on being, take
> pleasure in being. When the Dhamma is taught to them for the sake of
> the cessation of being, their awareness does not take to it, or become
> calm, settled, or inclined to it. These are those, monks, who hold
> back. And how, monks, do some overreach? Some are anxious,
> disaffected, and disgusted by that same being, and they take pleasure
> in cutting off being, saying “at the breakup of the body, the self is
> destroyed and perishes, and is nothing further after death – this is
> peace, this is fulfillment, this is truth.” These are those, monks,
> who overreach. And how, monks, do those with eyes see? Here, monks, a
> monk sees what has become as become (*bhikkhu bhūtaṃ bhūtato passa*).
> Having seen what has become as become (*bhūtaṃ bhūtato disvā*), he
> reaches disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation for what has become.
> In this way, monks, those with eyes see.” (Visuddhimagga XVIII.30; the
> translation is Heim’s and Ram-Prasad’s but I have added the Pali in
> key passages. The original quote is from the Itivuttaka, a short text
> within the Khuddhaka Nikāya of the Pali canon.)

Heim and Ram-Prasad read this passage as invoking a difference between
*diṭṭhi*, “view”, and *dassana*, “viewing” or “seeing”: “we are drawn
into seeing that ‘view’ – i.e., a view-point – is not the same as
‘viewing’ – i.e., the continual act of purified seeing.” (17) They want
this to mean that Buddhaghosa is refusing any sort of ontological
*diṭṭhi*, any “view” of how things are. But what the passage invokes is
not merely a difference between *diṭṭhi* and *dassana*, these two
similar nouns derived from the same root, but between those who are
*diṭṭhigata* – resorting to or stuck on a view – and “those with eyes”
who see (*cakkhumanto passanti*). It is relevant here that in the
closely related language of Sanskrit, the widely used term for a
metaphysical “view” is *darśana*, the exact equivalent of *dassana*,
which already makes me a little suspicious of a claim that a *diṭṭhi* is
a “view” and a *dassana* is not. Conversely it would be quite strange
for Buddhaghosa to reject all *diṭṭhi* when he accepts the [Noble
Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path),
whose first element is *sammādiṭṭhi*, right view.

And indeed, Buddhaghosa does not reject *diṭṭhi* as such in any of the
Visuddhimagga passages they analyze. Quite the contrary. Heim and
Ram-Prasad refer approvingly to “purified seeing”, but a few pages
earlier they have already noted the term Buddhaghosa regularly uses for
the purification of seeing, and it is not *dassanavisuddhi* but
*diṭṭhivisuddhi*. That is, one’s “view”, *diṭṭhi*, is itself purified.
Having a *diṭṭhi* is not the problem, being *diṭṭhigata* is. For those
who are *diṭṭhigata* either find “their awareness does not take to” the
Dhamma, or they make a materialist claim that directly contradicts the
claims Buddhaghosa makes elsewhere in the text. That prevents them, in
turn, from seeing what exists (*bhūta*) as it is. That is what makes
their seeing – whether one calls it *diṭṭhi* or *dassana* – impure, as
distinguished from those whose *diṭṭhi* has indeed been purified.

I split these hairs in order to counter what I think is Heim’s and
Ram-Prasad’s own hair-splitting: the important distinction Buddhaghosa
is making is *not* between these two forms of the word for “see”, as
they claim it is. The important distinction is not whether the “see”
word in question is *diṭṭhi*, *dassana* or *passanti* (the odd present
form of the same root). Rather, the important distinction is between
seeing correctly and seeing incorrectly. And Buddhaghosa, like many
other Buddhists, identifies seeing correctly in terms of [*seeing
as*](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/02/unconscious-illusions/):
here, seeing the *bhūta* (what exists, what has become) as the *bhūta*.
One must see entities as they actually are. The term that Heim and
Ram-Prasad typically render as “seeing correctly” is
*yathābhūtadassana*: literally, seeing according to the existent. This
is a correspondence theory of right view: things are a certain way, and
one who sees correctly sees things in that way that they are.

All of which is to disagree completely with Heim and Ram-Prasad’s next
paragraph:

> This framing of his inquiry into *nāmarūpa* as being about seeing is
> significant because it implies that what is said about this topic is
> not for the purpose of achieving a viewpoint or position about
> reality. The distinction above serves as a propaedeutic to his
> phenomenological practice – the structured attending to experience. We
> should remember that the practice is not only not for the purpose of
> arriving at conclusions about how things ultimately are, it is in fact
> directed towards developing the capacity to not seek such conclusions.
> (17)

This is not at all what Buddhaghosa is saying. Assuming that
“conclusion” is their rendering of *diṭṭhi*, Buddhaghosa’s point then is
*not* to avoid “conclusions”, but rather to *conclude correctly*. The
“conclusion” one needs to attain is a way of seeing, a *diṭṭhi* or
*dassana*, which may not be reducible to a proposition or set of
propositions. But that way of seeing *is* a way of seeing things as they
ultimately are.

That word “ultimately” itself needs more discussion – and that will be
the topic of my final post in this series.
