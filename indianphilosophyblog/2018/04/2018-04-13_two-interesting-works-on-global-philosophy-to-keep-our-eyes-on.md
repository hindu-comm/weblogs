Two interesting works on global philosophy to keep our eyes on

[What makes a philosopher
great?](https://www.routledge.com/What-Makes-a-Philosopher-Great-Thirteen-Arguments-for-Twelve-Philosophers/Hetherington/p/book/9781138936164)Edited
by Stephen Hetherington. While this has far more western thinkers than
non-Western on the list, it does have an essay by Jonardon Ganeri on
Buddhaghoṣa.

[Epistemology for the rest of the
world](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/epistemology-for-the-rest-of-the-world-9780190865085?cc=us&lang=en&).
Editedby Stephen Stich, Masaharu Mizumoto, and Eric McCready. While it
has an X-phil flavor, this textleads with Jonardon’s essay
“Epistemology from a Sanskritic Point of View”. (Related: see [this

gettier intuitions across cultures, [this

on cultural diversity in philosophy, and [this
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/03/16/philosophy-and-cultural-diversity-a-follow-up-on-keatings-questions/)
for reflections here that scholarly engagement with Indian philosophers
may speak better to philosophical questions than folk investigations of
contemporary Indian nationals.)
