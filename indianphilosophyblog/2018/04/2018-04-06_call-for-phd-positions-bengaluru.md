Call for PhD positions, Bengaluru

Sangeetha Menon from Bangalore, NIAS, and Marzenna Jakubczak have asked
me to promote a call for PhD students positions. All young scholars who
are interested in Kashmir Saivism or Indigenous Healing Practices are
welcome to apply. The application, as can be seen in the document below,
is quite informal (one basically only needs to email a 2,000 words
project, along with cv and copies of oneâ€™s degrees at
niasphd@gmail.com). **Deadline: 30.4.2018**
