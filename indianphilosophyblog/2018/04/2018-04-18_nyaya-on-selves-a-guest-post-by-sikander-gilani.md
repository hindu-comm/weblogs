Nyāya on selves (A guest post by Sikander Gilani)

(I received the following post from Sikander Gilani, who is a Philosophy
PhD student at Austin. They will surely be happy to read your questions
or feedback below.)

Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika holds that there are self substances that bear
psychological properties and initiate movements in the bodies they are
associated with, which can be animal (including human) or plant bodies.
Selves are eternal and immaterial, and incarnate in various bodies over
the course of a cycle of rebirths. The *Nyāya-sūtra* affirms this
substantialist position on the self in more than one sūtra, the earliest
and most important being *sūtra* 1.1.10:

> *icchādveṣaprayatnasukhaduḥkhajñānāni ātmano liṅgam iti* \|  
> Desire, aversion, effort, pleasure, pain, and knowledge are the marks
> of the self. (Vidyābhuṣana, 1913, p. 5)

In classical Indian logic, a mark (*liṅga*) is a property to which one
has epistemic access through any means of knowledge (*pramāṇa*).\* The
presence of the mark justifies an inference to the presence of some
other property, namely, the property to be proved (*sādhya*) (Phillips,
2012, pp. 50-71). In this argument the sādhana is a set of psychological
qualities (desire, aversion, etc.), and the *sādhya* is an enduring
substantial self. A natural next question to ask is how one can infer
from the *sādhana* to the *sādhya*. Later philosophers, including Nyāya
and Vaiśeṣika commentators, attempt to answer that question.

**Argument from diachronic unity**  
Vātsyāyana is one such commentator. He elaborates upon *Nyāya-sūtra*
1.1.10 in the form of an argument from diachronic unity, that is, from
the fact that there is mental unity over time, to the conclusion that
there is a substantial self that persists over time and serves as the
locus of such unity. I have reconstructed his argument as follows:

1.  Desire, aversion, etc. require memory and recognition.
2.  Desire, aversion, etc. exist.
3.  So, memory and recognition exist.
4.  If there were no continuing selves having desires, aversions, etc.,
    then at any one moment the content of a cognition would be no more
    connected with prior cognitions in the same person than with those
    in other persons.
5.  Memory and recognition amount to a connection between present and
    past cognitions in the same person that does not exist between
    cognitions in distinct persons.
6.  Therefore, there are continuing selves having desires, aversions,
    etc.\*\*

Premise 1 in the argument is supported by the observation that desire,
aversion, and effort require memory and recognition so that they can fix
on the appropriate objects: for example, we feel aversion to what has
caused pain in the past, but in order to do so there must be recognition
that it is the same type of object. Pain and pleasure do not require
memory – though knowledge of what is painful and pleasurable of course
do – which means that this argument, at least as currently stated, does
not establish all six qualities as marks of the soul, but only desire,
aversion, effort, and knowledge.  
Premise 2 is supported by introspection, and is uncontroversial.  
Premise 3 is a sub-conclusion that follows deductively from the first
two premises.  
Premise 4 is partly supported by the observation that we do not remember
what happens to others as we remember what happens to us, and we are not
averse to or desirous of things on the basis of others’ experiences of
pleasure and pain in the way that we are of our own.  
In its current form premise 4 is not defensible, as clearly there is no
logical necessity of an enduring self for diachronic mental unity. There
is also no reason to think – and Vātsyāyana does not provide us with any
– that there is some other kind of necessity either, such as necessity
due to the laws of nature.  
Alternative explanations of memory and recognition are at least
logically consistent and are, to the extent of our knowledge, at least
as consistent with the laws of nature as substantialist theses. These
alternatives are explanations of memory and recognition in terms of a
transmission of the relevant information from one entity to another,
where the entities are not substantial selves. For example, a
contemporary scientific materialist may try to explain memory and
recognition in terms of the storage of information in the brain, and the
later retrieval of that information through material processes that at
no point involve substantial selves.\*\*\* The Buddhists explain it in
terms of the transmission of information from one fundamental entity
(*dharma*), which exists for a moment (*kṣaṇa*), to the next *dharma*.
As long as such explanations are possible, the mere fact that diachronic
unity exists in individual minds in the form of memory and recognition
does not conclusively prove that substantial selves exists.  
Can there still be reasons to prefer the substantialist thesis, however,
even if the existence of one does not follow from the existence of
memory and recognition in the way that Vātsyāyana claims? In my opinion,
yes. It is not memory or recognition, but identity, or the sense of
self, that should be taken as at least one *liṅga* of the *ātman*. In
fact, identification may be involved in other types of synchronic and
diachronic cognitive unity, but that is not a position I will explicate
or defend here. Identification encompasses everything from our sense of
ownership over our body and body-parts, to our sense of certain
ancestries, personality traits, or situational properties belonging to
us. Identification is by its very nature ‘selfal’, that is, selfness
infuses the identification experience, and when there is identification
with some property or object, there is a representation of the target of
identification bearing a certain unique relationship with the self. I
would go so far as to say that it is impossible for the self not to
exist in some form, given that identification exists. But even if we do
not accept this, a presumption of non-skepticism, which is independently
plausible or required for any fruitful philosophical practice, can help
us here and give us *prima facie* reason to accept the self exists based
on the identification experience. The self cannot be the same as
identification, as identification represents that some entity bears a
certain relationship with the self. This means that the self exists and
is something other than the identification experience.  
From here making the case that the self is an individual substance or an
object is not difficult. Reflection on experience as well as on the
nature of self-talk suggests that selves are particulars and concrete,
and that they are not properties, events, states, or processes. For
example, selves are not predicated to objects, rather, properties are
predicated to selves. We do not talk about selves happening the way that
we do with events or processes, rather we talk about selves existing.
And we do not talk about selves obtaining in the way that we do about
states or facts. Even granting for now the possibility of being
systematically deluded in our self-talk, the principle of non-skepticism
allows these facts about our experience and everyday speech to be *prima
facie* evidence in favour of the claim that selves are objects.

**Notes**  
\* The Naiyāyikas consider perception (*pratyakṣa*), testimony
(*śabda*), inference (*anumāna*), and analogy (*upamāna*) to be the four
*pramāṇa*s.  
\*\* This reconstruction is partly based on the exposition of Vātsyāyana
provided by Dasti and Phillips in their *The Nyāya-sūtra* (2017, pp.
75-77).  
\*\*\* This point has also been made by Parfit (1984, pp. 223-24) and
Siderits (2003, p. 23).
