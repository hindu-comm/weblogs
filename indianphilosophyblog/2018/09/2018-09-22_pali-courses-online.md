Pāli courses online

For those of you who are interested in learning Pāli, the Middle
Indo-Aryan language used by Theravāda Buddhists, you may want to have a
look at the new on-demand course from the Oxford Centre for Buddhist
Studies. I know one of the teachers there (Alexander Wrona) and can only
speak in favour of him and of his enthusiasm for Pāli. You can learn
know about the classes at
[this](https://ocbs.org/online-pali-course-levels-1-3/) link or through
this
[OCBS-Pali1-Flyer](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/OCBS-Pali1-Flyer.pdf)
(CAUTION: it contains a special voucher!).

Have fun with Pāli!
