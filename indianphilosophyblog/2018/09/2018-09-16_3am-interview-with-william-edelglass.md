3AM interview with William Edelglass

[Another

with philosophers working in Indian thought, this time with [William
Edelglass](https://www.marlboro.edu/community/stories/undergraduate/william_edelglass)
at Marlboro College, Vermont. The interview covers a lot of
ground–including his arguments that Buddhist thinkers are best
understood as moral pluralists, his thoughts on the Anthropocene,
especially with regard to Levinas and Engaged Buddhism, and
methodological reflections on the relationship between so-called
“Western” and “non-Western” philosophy. While Edelglass doesn’t
explicitly connect Levinas and Buddhism, as he has done elsewhere (such
as “[Ethics and the Subversion of Reification in Levinas and
Śāntideva](https://www.academia.edu/7128729/Ethics_and_the_Subversion_of_Reification_in_Levinas_and_Santideva)“)
setting his remarks side-by-side, we can sense how he might understand
them as resonating together:

> …grounded in the doctrine of dependent origination, Śāntideva provides
> rich descriptions of the moral significance of intention and
> consequence, character and action, without seeking to circumscribe all
> moral activity under one principle…
>
> 

> Levinas’s ethics is grounded in a phenomenological method; he
> approaches ethics through a description of the relation with the
> Other, rather than focusing on moral principles that have been
> abstracted from this relation…
>
> 
>
> Levinas’s interpretive phenomenological ethics, in contrast to most
> Western moral philosophies, offers no universal moral principles or
> prescriptions.

The interview concludes with some remarks about the limitations of our
current vocabulary around philosophical traditions, and Edelglass’
experience teaching “Western” philosophy to Tibetan monks at Dharamsala.
