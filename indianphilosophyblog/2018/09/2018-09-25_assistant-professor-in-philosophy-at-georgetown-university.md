Bryce Huebner shared this [new posting for Georgetown
University](https://philjobs.org/job/show/11058):

> The Department of Philosophy at Georgetown University is searching for
> a tenure-track assistant professor, beginning August 2019. The
> teaching load will be two courses per semester, with teaching

> We are looking for candidates who take a philosophical approach to
> race, or whose work is substantively engaged with a disadvantaged or
> marginalized racial, ethnic, or regional group; candidates who are
> working on questions in metaphysics, epistemology, or philosophy of
> science that intersect with the study of race, broadly construed, are
> encouraged to apply.

The AOS categories listed are African/Africana Philosophy, Arabic and
Islamic Philosophy, Asian Philosophy, Latin American Philosophy, Native
American Philosophy, Philosophy of Race.
