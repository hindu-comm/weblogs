Freschi on Alternative Theisms in The Philosopher’s Magazine

In my department, we pass around The Philosopher’s Magazine when the
physical issue comes in the mail. Much to my delight, in an issuewith
special focus on Comparative Philosophy, I found that our own Elisa
Freschi has an excellent article on learning from alternative (that is
Indian) theisms. Also in the issue is a delightful correspondence
between Sir Richard Sorabji and Michael Puett on Chinese Philosophy and
Stoicism. More information
