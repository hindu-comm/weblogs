Philosophy of action

In case you missed it, I would like to recommend a [website on
philosophy of action](https://www.philosophyofaction.com) which is a
great single go-to page for almost anything related to the topic. It
offers links, biographies, encyclopedic entries, essays, videos and
learning materials on various facets of philosophy of action. It has
also a section on [job
vacancies](https://www.philosophyofaction.com/careers-with-philosophy-and-uses-of-the-field)
and one with short
[interviews](https://www.philosophyofaction.com/in-conversation-with)
with scholars working on philosophy of action. It is learned and
enjoyable and the same time, a great achievement.

Credits: The website was founded by Andrei Buckareff and Constantine
Sandis. I do not know Buckareff, but Sandis is not only an acute scholar
with broad interests, but also a great organiser, as the website shows.
It is now edited by István Zárdai. Based on my interactions with him, I
can only add my kudos for his work!
