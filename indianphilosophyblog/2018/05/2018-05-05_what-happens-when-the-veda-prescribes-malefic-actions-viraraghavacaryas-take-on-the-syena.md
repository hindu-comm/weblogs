What happens when the Veda prescribes malefic actions? Vīrarāghavācārya’s take on the Śyena

To my knowledge, Veṅkaṭanātha’s Seśvaramīmāṃsā (henceforth SM) has been
commented upon only once in Sanskrit, namely in the 20th c. by Abhinava
Deśika Vīrarāghavācārya.  
Vīrarāghavācārya continues Veṅkaṭanātha’s agenda in reinterpreting
Mīmāṃsā tenets in a Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta way.

On the meaning of dharma and on the polemics between a *sādhya* and
*siddha* interpretation of the Veda, he writes:

> Deities need to be pleased (ārādhya), what needs to be realised is the
> result.
>
> (ārādhyā devatāḥ, sādhyaṃ phalam, ad SM ad PMS 1.1.1, 1971 edition of
> the SM, p.10)

Similarly, within the commentary on SM ad PMS 1.1.2, Vīrarāghavācārya
interprets a quote by Parāśara Bhaṭṭa according to Maṇḍana’s distinction
among various deontic concepts and then adds a further level:

> The instruction which has necessarily to be performed is the command.
> The permission is the instruction which presupposes a desire for the
> experience of a result which is not forbidden. It has as content
> something desirable. An instruction having as content a forbidden
> purpose (as in the case of the Śyena) is a permission which has
> occurred automatically \[but will be later subdued\] (āpātānujñā).

The added level is labelled *āpātānujñā*. This is, as far as I know, a
neologism. It indicates the fact that prescriptions about malefic
sacrifices are not the Veda’s final words on the topic. They look like
prescriptions, but in fact:

1.  like all other textual passages presupposing human desires, they are
    only instructions about how to reach something, they do not state
    that one should desire it.
2.  on top of that will then be sublated insofar as they presuppose a
    purpose which is prohibited in another part of the Veda.

Point 1 is a standard Mīmāṃsā devise to justify Vedic passages about
malefic sacrifices. Vīrarāghavācārya adds point 2 to the landscape, thus
highlighting that the textual passages about malefic sacrifices are
ultimately sublated insofar as the purpose they presuppose is
prohibited.

Vīrarāghavācārya probably formed the term *āpātānujñā* on the basis of
*āpātadhī*. This is a term introduced by Rāmānuja and discussed at
length by Veṅkaṭanātha. It means \`automatic understanding’ of the Veda,
the one one gathers while learning the Veda by heart without caring for
investigating into its meaning. Such an automatic understanding will be
later revised while one investigates the meaning of the Veda.
Vīrarāghavācārya implicitly suggests that it can even be completely
reversed.

**Have readers ever encountered the term *āpātānujñā*?**
