Translations of the Gita that aren’t too frustrating

Friends, I’ve been teaching the Bhagavad Gītāin Indian philosophy and
World philosophy courses for over a decade, as well as incorporating
selections of the Gītāinto other course offerings. I’ve yet to use a
version that isn’t frustrating. Even those that are philologically
credible are often clunky or make interpretative choices that I find at
odds with easy classroom use. This year I found myself translating
relevant verses on the fly while lecturing, out of dissatisfaction with
the texts.

Of course, I haven’t read every translation or even most (and thus no
offense to those of you who have penned translations yourselves; assume
I haven’t tried yours!).

I am asking veteran teachers for suggestions on what works.In my case,
I’m teaching philosophy students and humanities students for the most
part, not aspiring Sanskritists.

I’m not fishing for criticisms of existing translations. And I’m not
going to mention the ones I’ve found frustrating, because my point isn’t
to complain but rather locate useful directions.
