Call for Submissions in Hindu & Cross-Cultural Philosophy of Religion: International Journal of Hindu Studies

Submitted to the blog by Ayon Maharaj

Call for Submissions in Hindu & Cross-Cultural Philosophy of Religion:
International Journal of Hindu Studies

I am Section Editor of the [International Journal of Hindu
Studies](https://www.springer.com/religious+studies/journal/11407),
overseeing submissions in Hindu and Cross-Cultural Philosophy of
Religion. I would like to encourage all of you to consider submitting
manuscripts in this area.

To give you a sense of the range of topics falling within this area, I
include below a brief description of this section of IJHS:

> The “Hindu and Cross-Cultural Philosophy of Religion” Section of the
> International Journal of Hindu Studies serves as a forum for critical
> investigations of Hindu contributions to the field of cross-cultural
> philosophy of religion. Various methodological approaches are welcome,
> including in-depth studies of Hindu philosophical themes, comparative
> examinations of Hindu and non-Hindu figures and paradigms, as well as
> cross-cultural discussions of key topics in the philosophy of
> religion. Topics include, but are not limited to, arguments for and
> against the existence of God, the nature and epistemology of religious
> faith, the problem of evil, theories of religious diversity, the
> relationship between religion and science, and the phenomenology and
> epistemology of mystical experience.

If you’ve written or plan to write an essay on any topic falling broadly
within the field of Hindu and Cross-Cultural Philosophy of Religion, I
hope you will consider submitting it to IJHS. Please don’t hesitate to
email me if you have any questions or need any further clarification.

On a different but related note, I wanted to give you a heads up about a
Special Issue I am editing on “Hindu Theodicies,” which is slated to be
published in a 2020 issue of IJHS. The Special Issue will highlight the
variety of theodicies in Hindu philosophical traditions, emphasizing
those that have received less attention in the scholarly literature. The
contributors and topics are as follows:

David Peter Lawrence: Kaśmīri Śaiva theodicy  
Elisa Freschi: Viśiṣṭādvaita theodicy  
Michael Williams: Mādhva theodicy  
David Buchta: Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava theodicy  
Ayon Maharaj: Sri Aurobindo’s theodicy  
Ankur Barua: Comparative Hindu-Christian theodicy
