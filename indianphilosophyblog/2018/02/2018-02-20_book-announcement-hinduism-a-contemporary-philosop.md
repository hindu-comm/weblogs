Book Announcement — Hinduism: A Contemporary Philosophical Investigation

Dear Indian Philosophy Bloggers and Readers

I would like to share with you news of my in-press book. It is scheduled
to be out in July, which is late to be considered for September teaching
and research, so I thought I would announce it now, in case it is
relevant to your fall research or teaching work.

The book is called *[Hinduism: A Contemporary Philosophical
Investigation](https://www.routledge.com/Hinduism-A-Contemporary-Philosophical-Investigation/Ranganathan/p/book/9781138909106)*
(Routledge 2019).

Its part of a larger series, titled *Investigating Philosophy of
Religion*. Each peer reviewed volume is dedicated to a single religion.
So far the volumes for Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism are
in-press or released.

Here is the publisher’s back of book blurb:

*Hinduism: A Contemporary Philosophical Investigation*explores Hinduism
and the distinction between the secular and religious on a global scale.
According to Ranganathan, a careful philosophical study of Hinduism
reveals it as the microcosm of philosophical disagreements with Indian
resources, across a variety of topics, including: ethics, logic, the
philosophy of thought, epistemology, moral standing, metaphysics, and
politics. This analysis offers an original and fresh diagnosis of
studying Hinduism, colonialism and a global rise of hyper-nationalism,
as well as the frequent acrimony between scholars and practitioners of
Hindu traditions.

This text is appropriate for use in undergraduate and graduate courses
on Hinduism, and Indian philosophy, and can be used as an advanced
introduction to the problems of philosophy with South Asian resources.

Here is the TOC:

*Index*

Just to clarify: the book is not primarily about Hindu philosophy. It’s
an account of Hinduism, the religion. Hence, to get to this point, I
provide a general account of how something comes to be identified as a
religion in our world (it is political and has to do with the tradition
I call the *W*est—italicized upper case “W”) and note that Hinduism is
the odd member of this club: whereas most religions are identifiable
with some minimal comprehensive view, figure, text, or doctrine,
Hinduism is simply the microcosm of philosophical disagreements, with a
South Asian twist. So in the end, I do review and explore Hindu
philosophies but as a means of representing Hinduism in terms of its
disagreements. The other topic of this book is the *W*est, a tradition
that identifies its cultural contingencies with the very content of
thought itself, disappearing alien moral and political theorizing and in
its place identifying religions to be studied social scientifically and
not as a contribution to philosophy. The methodological distinction
between interpretation (the method of the *W*est) and explication (the
method of philosophy) plays an important part in this argument too.

Theproject, while philosophical (focused on an analysis of Hinduism,
the concept), is largely informed by scholars of Hinduism (who
frequently take opposing views) whose contribution to the field informed
my thinking about that massive religion called Hinduism. Just when I
thought I had some idea about what Hinduism is, a scholar would share
their work and I would have to revise my conception of Hinduism,
eventually leading me to the idea that it’s just more accurate to talk
about Hinduism in terms of its disagreements than some common platform.
