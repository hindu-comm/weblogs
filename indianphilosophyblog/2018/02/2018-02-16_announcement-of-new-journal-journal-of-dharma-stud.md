Announcement of new journal: Journal of Dharma Studies

Posted at large by Laura M. Dunn, GTU Berkley

Dear friends,

We are proud to announce the formal launch of the Journal of Dharma
Studies (previously, the International Journal of Dharma Studies)
through Springer Publications, under the editorship of Purushottama
Bilimoria and Rita D. Sherma. We welcome submissions to our submissions
page. To submit, please register for an author login on our site and
follow the instructions. If you have any questions, please contact the
editorial manager, Laura Dunn, at ldunn@ses.gtu.edu. We look forward to
your submissions.

The mission of the Journal of Dharma Studies: Philosophy, Theology,
Ethics, and Practice is to employ theoretical and empirical
methodologies for the intersubjective understanding of, and real-world
applications of the conceptual resources, textual sources, and
experiential practices—including ritual, social, ethical, liturgical,
contemplative, or communitarian—to foster critical-constructive
reflections on Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions (what is now
referred to as Dharma Studies). The journal seeks to contextualize these
traditions in reference to the contemporary global era, with large
diasporic populations that affiliate with these religions to be found
across the globe. The journal seeks to cultivate scholarship that
simultaneously uncovers both the interconnected histories of these
traditions and, simultaneously highlight the significant differences and
rich diversity of philosophy and practice found within these Dharma
Traditions. The scope of the journal lies beyond purely descriptive,
journalistic, methodologies and moves towards an expansion of Dharma
Studies to intersect with emerging areas and disciplines with the aim of
a robust and rigorous interdisciplinary discourse on Hindu, Jain, and
Buddhist Philosophy, Theology, Ethics, and Practice in engagement with
areas including but not limited to:

§ Sustainability Studies and Religions  
Ø Ecological Economics  
Ø Environmental Ethics  
Ø Social Equitability  
Ø Peace and Conflict Studies  
§ Medicine and Religion  
§ Contemplative Studies  
§ Aesthetics and Semiotics  
§ Consciousness Studies  
§ Philosophy of Ritual  
§ Theology and the Natural Sciences  
§ Religion and Bioscience  
§ Cross-Cultural and Diaspora Studies in Religion

Investigates, presents, interprets, and envisions the shared and
distinct categories of the life-worlds of the Indic Religions globally
in a multidisciplinary format with articles from religious studies,
philosophy, ethics, cultural studies, musicology, film, contemporary
issues, sociology, anthropology, and the arts within a structure that
maintains the rigor of conventional academic discourse, but adds
methodological contextualization and investigative, epistemic,
hermeneutical and evaluative perspectives from these religious and
cultural traditions in conversation with the world’s religions and the
concerns of our time  
This journal has been conceived as an interdisciplinary forum for
evaluating the contemporary contributions of Indic religions and Dharma
traditions within the context of a new and dynamic setting that
acknowledges globalization and global flows of thought. The purpose is
to create an intellectual space for the revitalization of discourses and
conceptual categories specific to Dharma traditions, examining the
re-emergence, reformulations, and engagement of these traditions within
the Western cultural and theoretical context. In addition, the journal
encourages the formation of a new literary and artistic space through
the publication of poetry, works of fiction and art commentary.
