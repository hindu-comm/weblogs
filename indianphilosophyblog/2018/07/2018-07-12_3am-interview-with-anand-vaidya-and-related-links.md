3am interview with Anand Vaidya (and related links)

The online magazine [3AM](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/) just
published [an interview with Anand Jayprakash
Vaidya](https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/hindu-syllogisms-and-dark-necessities-go-fusion/),
which ranges from discussion of his personal journey through philosophy
to the so-called “Hindu Syllogism” to seeing absences to “cross-cultural
and multi-disciplinary philosophy” and more. Vaidya does a nice job of
pointing readers to a wide range of philosophers working in Indian
philosophy and adjacent fields, so that philosophers interested in
expanding their repertoire beyond “Western” philosophy have significant
resources to do so from the piece. An excerpt:

> One lesson I take from looking at classical Indian philosophical
> discussions of the perception of absence is that discussion of the
> *perception of absence* comes along with discussion of the *ontology
> of absence*. Some schools hold that the world contains absences in
> addition to presences. And discussions of the perception of absence
> are linked to ontological views. This is *absent* in contemporary
> analytic discussions…
>
> …More importantly, though, we have an opportunity here. It seems as if
> the debate in analytic philosophy on the perception of absence is just
> starting, at least in the recent literature. Why not take a look at
> the rich, long, and extensive debate over the perception of absence in
> Indian philosophy as a way of just getting up to speed on the issues?
> Don’t we already do that when we study other topics in Western
> philosophy. If I am writing on ethics, I would and should consult the
> history of ethics when developing my view. Similarily, it seems that
> we have a rich history of the discussion of absence that can help
> inform the current debate. And believe me, regardless of whether the
> views are the best on offer, those that like to think about
> alternative philosophical moves one can make in a debate will have
> plenty to be impressed with.

In another corner of the philosophical Internet, [Daily
Nous](http://dailynous.com/2018/07/10/end-philosophical-protectionism/)
links to the interview and, inspired by it, constructs a metaphor of
“philosophical protectionism”, in which “Unfamiliarity with and disdain
for non-Western philosophy function as tariffs on it, making its entry
into philosophy’s main marketplace of ideas more difficult, and
discouraging its production by making it professionally riskier.” In the
comments section, much discussion then revolves around whether and how
“non-Western” philosophy is legitimate, interesting, valuable, and so
on.

Inspired by these comments, Ethan Mills, at his personal blog, posted a
“[Pre-prolegomena to Future Discussions of Including Non-Western
Philosophy in the
Curriculum](http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/2018/07/pre-prolegomena-to-future-discussions.html),”
which raises some questions he finds useful prior to entry into such
conversations, like “Is the concept of being “philosophically
interesting” something other than a fancy way of re-stating one’s
personal intellectual tastes? If so, can this concept be articulated
with anything resembling the rigor some people expect from
philosophers?”

Readers here may find all three of these posts interesting, though the
typical online advice probably does hold for the second: Don’t read the
comments. (Or if you want to, Amy Olberding’s [now-classic
post](http://dailynous.com/2016/05/13/when-someone-suggests-expanding-the-canon/)
is a good-enough substitute.)
