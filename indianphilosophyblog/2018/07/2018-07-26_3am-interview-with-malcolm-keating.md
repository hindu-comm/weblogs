3AM Interview with Malcolm Keating

Malcolm haskindlyalerted the Blog about the spate of recent 3AM
Magazine interviews with philosophers who focus on India. But humility
has likely prevented him from noting his own. So I am happy to do
so.Please find the interview
here:<https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/indian-philosophy-of-language/>

There is much to enjoy and learn from here, including reflections on the
overlap between linguistics and philosophy of language, literal and
non-literal meaning in India, the nature of reference in general, poetic
language, and much more.
