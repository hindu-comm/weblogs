Summer Sanskrit at Harvard

This message was sent out by Michael Witzel. It is a great way for
students of Indian philosophy to develop a strong grounding in Sanskrit
through an intensive course.

> Just as for the past 25 years, we will offer a course “Beginning
> Sanskrit” in the Harvard Summer School:
>
> Seven-week session: June 18–August 6, 2016 (exam on August 12).
