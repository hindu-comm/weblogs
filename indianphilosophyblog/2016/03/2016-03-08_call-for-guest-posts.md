Call for guest-posts

The administrators and editors of the Indian Philosophy Blog (  
[Amod](mailto:amod.lele@gmail.com),
[Elisa](mailto:elisa.freschi@oeaw.ac.at),
[Ethan](mailto:ethan-mills@utc.edu), and
[Matthew](mailto:matthewdasti@gmail.com)) have been considering ways
that we can widen the pool of contributors while maintaining the quality
of our current contributions. To this end, we are here issuing a
standing call for guest-posts. We would like to invite contributions
consisting in academic investigations into Indian philosophy that meet
the standard set already by existing blog posts. We hope that this is a
way that scholars may share their work or interests with the wider
community and that the blog may continue to foster collegiality between
the members of our field.  
In particular, we welcome:

1.  guest posts by graduate students presenting their research,
2.  guest posts by PhD holders or PhD students presenting a paper (by
    them or by other people) which has recently been published on a peer
    review journal (or book) or accepted for a conference,
3.  guest posts by PhD holders or PhD students surveying the literature
    on a given topic.

If you are interested, proposals may be send to any of the admins noted
above. Please include a CV or link to your academic webpage. If the
admins agree that the proposal fits our content guidelines, it will be
published.

If you would like to know more about the possibility of posting, please
write any of our admins noted above, and we can explain the process.
