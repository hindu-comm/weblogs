Translating Commentaries

Translated commentaries can sound very clunky. While I work often with
Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava texts, I’ve read enough Yoga, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, etc. to
know that there are some basic techniques that commentators use when
commenting on root texts (sūtra, śruti, smṛti, etc.), and that these
techniques don’t always facilitate translation into English, German,
etc. (for more discussion, see Tubb and Bose’s *Scholastic Sanskrit).*
In commentating, commentators often do:

1.  the glossing of words in the root text (e.g. providing definitions
    and various meanings of a Sanskrit word with other Sanskrit words),
2.  the elaboration or expansion on a passage by inserting entire
    paragraphs, sentences or phrases in between words, verses, sūtras,
    etc. from a root text,
3.  the quotation of other relevant verses, sūtras, etc. within the
    commentary on a particular passage to show to illuminate meaning,
    continuity, etc.,
4.  the quotation of a previous commentator, either to agree or disagree
    with him.

In a few of my
[publications](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.135.1.49?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
I’ve started to develop a technique for making translations less clunky,
and my best shot at it is this. When translating, you change the
typeface to reflect what the commentator is doing with a particular
word/phrase/sentence:

***Bold-italics –***quotes from *śruti*, *smṛti, sūtra, mūla, etc.*

*Italics –*quotes from commentary or independent texts

**Bold –**words that are glossed from *śruti, smṛti, sūtra, mūla*, etc.

**Italics-underline* –*comments on commentary

I’ve tried to use these various forms of typeface to indicate to the
reader of a translation what a commentators is doing. It allows the
reader to see when a commentator is elaborating on the meaning of the
root text, on a scriptural passage, a previous commentators, and it does
so simply by changing the typeface.

What do you think of this technique?
