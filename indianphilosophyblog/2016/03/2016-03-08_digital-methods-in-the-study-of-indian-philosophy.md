Digital Methods in the Study of Indian Philosophy

I’ve just returned from a conference dedicated to [“Digital Textualities
in South Asia”](https://dtsa.ubcsanskrit.ca/) at UBC. One of the main
goals of the conference was to gauge what kinds of digital tools and
resources are being developed in South Asian studies, and I noticed that
many of the projects were basically concerned with textual criticism.
One model that at least three presenters used was (1) transcribing large
numbers of manuscripts of a given text; (2) semi-automatically collating
these manuscripts using programs like CollateX; and (3) developing a
stemma using phylogenetic software. I [talked
about](https://prezi.com/-mde_4yynp_d/treasury-department-anthologies-in-the-digital-age/)
something more general—strategies and standards in the production of
digital texts, using literary anthologies as a test-case.

What about Indian Philosophy? How, if at all, has the transition to
digitial media transformed our research? Most of the projects that I am
aware with are concerned with making digital texts available. There is,
first of all, the [SARIT project](http://sarit.indology.info/), which
has excellent coverage of Buddhist philosophical texts thanks to the
direction of Birgit Kellner. (I can promise that more Mīmāṃsā texts are
coming soon!) SARIT provides downloadable e-texts as well as a search
interface for those texts. Then there is the [digital
Prasthānatrayam](http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/) provided by the
Advaita Śāradā at Sringeri, which provides a completely hyperlinked text
of all of Śaṅkarācārya’s commentaries. Besides these general resources,
there is an in-progress database of [Fragments of Indian
Philosophy](http://www.ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Fragments_of_Indian_Philosophy)
run by Ernst Prets at the IKGA. This project is particularly exciting,
first because it is a million times easier to keep track of fragments
using digital tools than print resources, and second because the
inherently linked and relational nature of fragments makes it very
natural to treat them as “linked open data,” which has a number of
exciting applications. (See the [Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts
Series](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/) and [Sharing Ancient
Wisdoms](http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/).) Finally, there are teaching
applications, such as the annotation software that Malcolm mentioned in
a [recent
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/02/28/teaching-the-tarkasa%E1%B9%83graha-to-first-year-students/).

That said, my impression is that philosophy and South Asian studies are
among the least “digitized” academic fields/disciplines, and Indian
Philosophy falls in the middle of this Venn Diagram of analog
scholarship. I think there is still a lot we can do, and a lot of
interesting projects to be designed. With this post I wanted to pose a
couple of questions.

-   What am I missing? What exciting digital projects are out there that
    have some relevance to the study of Indian philosophy?
-   How, if at all, do digital tools and resources (like GRETIL, SARIT,
    etc.) change the way that we do our research on a practical level?
-   How, if at all, do digital tools and resources change the
    *questions* that our research begins with?
-   How can we use digital projects to change the “user base” of Indian
    philosophy? (i.e., can we get more people involved, either as
    readers, collaborators, annotators, etc.?)
-   What would you like to see happen in this area? What kinds of
    projects would be useful or interesting to you?

**ADDENDUM:**  
Here is a running list of digital tools and projects that might
conceivably be used to study Indian philosophy:

-   [SARIT](http://sarit.indology.info/) (texts)
-   [EAST](http://east.uni-hd.de/) (bio-bibliographical database)
-   [SAT Daizōkyō Text
    Database](http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/index_en.html) (Buddhist
    canonical texts)
-   [Digital Pali Reader](http://pali.sirimangalo.org/)
-   [Śāstravid](http://sastravid.theology.ox.ac.uk/) (concepts in Indian
    philosophy, with a focus on Madhyamaka)
-   [Digital Dictionary of Buddhism](http://www.buddhism-dict.net/ddb/)
    (strongest on East Asian Buddhism)
