Inclusion on the APA Blog

Our very own [Anand Vaidya](http://anandvaidya.weebly.com) has two
recent blog posts on the new [Blog of the American Philosophical
Association](http://blog.apaonline.org). The first post, [“The
Inclusion Problem in the Philosophy of Mind: The Case of
Dualism,”](http://blog.apaonline.org/2016/01/07/the-inclusion-problem-in-the-philosophy-of-mind-the-case-of-dualism/)
looks at ways to include non-Western philosophy(specifically
Dharmakīrti and Ibn Sina) in a philosophy of mind course. The second,
[“The Inclusion Problem in the Philosophy of Mind: Questions and
Response,”](http://blog.apaonline.org/2016/01/08/the-inclusion-problem-in-the-philosophy-of-mind-questions-and-responses/)addresses
a number of typical worries about cross-cultural inclusion in philosophy
courses.

Even if you don’t teach philosophy of mind courses, you might find
Anand’s posts insightful and worth sharing with colleagues. I also
imagine many of us will be glad to see Indian philosophy featured so
prominently on the official blog of a major philosophy organization like
the APA. Thanks, Anand!
