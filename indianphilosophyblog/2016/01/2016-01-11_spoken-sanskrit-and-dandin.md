Spoken Sanskrit and Daṇḍin

Over at the [Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu), Victor
Mair has a [post about spoken
Sanskrit](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412) at the recent
international workshop, “A Lasting Vision: Daṇḍin’s Mirror in the World
of Asian Letters”. The workshop itself may be of interest to readers of
this blog, since Alaṁkāraśāstra is (I would argue) a significant
*philosophical tradition* (despite its lack of representation in places
such as [Potter’s Encyclopedia of Indian
Philosophies](http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/). The lectures have
been [uploaded on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsTdYxkp6R3lhrG_pu_CUn8V).

The focus of Mair’s post, however, is not philosophical, but his
observations about the Sanskrit spoken by scholars at the conference,
and his surprise at its being used in this way (he says, “I had always
thought of it as long-dead, classical language and because, from having
studied it for several years, I was intimately familiar with the
extraordinary complexity of its grammar, which made me think that it was
not suited for quotidian purposes”). The post includes discussion of
spoken Sanskrit by David Shulman, Whitney Cox, Frederick Smith, Shenghai
Li, and Devin Patel.

That Sanskrit would be *spoken* at a conference on Daṇḍin, is of course,
appropriate, given his attitude towards speech–and in what follows I
quote from Pollock’s *The Language of the Gods in the Worlds of
Men*–“This entire triple world would become pitch darkness if ever to
the end of days the light called speech should cease to shine” (p.82).
Pollock’s remarks on Daṇḍin and Bhartṛhari , orality and writing, are
useful, too:

> The Daṇḍin and Bhartṛhari who celebrated the spoken lived in a world
> where the written had permeated both *kāvya* and *śāstra* for
> centuries. Many of the foundational texts of the Sanskrit intellectual
> tradition were composed in a literate environment even as they bear
> the shadow of the oral…There is thus no little irony in the fact that
> Sanskrit culture, in the form in which it became *Sanskrit*, and not
> just *vaidika*–culture, was centrally based on writing, given the
> *ídee reçu* long dominant in Indology of the culture’s allegiance to
> orality. What made *kāvya* historically possible as a cultural
> practice at all was writing itself; indeed, one could say that *kāvya*
> was the name given to an expressive text that was written down–and the
> text was the kind it was precisely because it was written down (p.83).

A final note, in the comments section, someone posted a link to the
[Australian Spoken Sanskrit Summer
School](https://sites.google.com/site/spokensanskrit16/), which takes
place this (Australian) summer, from February 7 to 19, 2016.

Did any readers attend the conference? If so, did you notice the
phenomenon of spoken Sanskrit, and do you have any thoughts to add (such
as the relationship between the spoken and written word)?
