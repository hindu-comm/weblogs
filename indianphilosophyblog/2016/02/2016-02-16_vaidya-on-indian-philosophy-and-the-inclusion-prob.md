Vaidya on Indian Philosophy and the Inclusion Problem in Critical Thinking Education

Blog contributor Anand Vaidya has written before on what he calls the
inclusion problem in philosophy (see links to his previous
discussions[here](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/01/13/inclusion-on-the-apa-blog/)).
In [a new post on the Blog of the
APA](http://blog.apaonline.org/2016/02/15/the-inclusion-problem-in-critical-thinking-the-case-of-indian-philosophy/)
he’s considering what Indian philosophy might contribute to the ways
philosophers currently teach critical thinking.

Anand begins by noting the importance of critical thinking education for
many philosophy departments today. However, few of the standard
critical thinking textbooks mention any non-Western material. Anand
says,

> This could leave a student with the impression that while Socrates,
> Aristotle, John Venn, and George Boole all contributed to the
> development of logic and critical thinking, no non-western thinker had
> anything to say about these matters.
>
> This would not be a problem if it were true that non-western
> philosophers had nothing to say about matters pertaining to logic and
> critical thinking. And it would not be such a problem even if they did
> have something to say, if it were also true that logic and critical
> thinking were not important parts of an education in philosophy and
> the humanities in general.*But it is a problem, becausethere are
> many contributions from non-western traditions, such as Arabic
> philosophy, Chinese philosophy, and Indian philosophy*, and*often we
> sell the importance of philosophy by pointing to critical
> thinking.*In this post, I will try to briefly characterize one
> location where one can find an important kind of contribution to
> critical thinking that is relevant to contemporary issues concerning
> critical-thinking education and its future direction.

Anand goes on to discuss the character view of critical thinking
education and how two Indian texts, the*Carakasaṃhitā*and
the*Milinda-Pañhā,*might contribute to critical thinking education
within in this framework.
