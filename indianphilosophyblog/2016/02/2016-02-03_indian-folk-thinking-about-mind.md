Indian “folk thinking” about mind

A query for the blog members and community from Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad:
“Is there any research that people are aware of on folk thinking about
mind in India? It is quite striking, I suppose, that we are all so
familiar with and embedded in the philosophical thinking of that
question with regard to Indian traditions, but not on this.”

Does anyone have any suggestions?
