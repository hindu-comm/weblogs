News from Manipal University (a guest post by Mrinal Kaul)

Dear readers of the Indian Philosophy Blog,

I am delighted to share with all of you that we have been able to
establish a Centre for Religious Studies (CRS) in Manipal University. As
the coordinator of this centre I look forward receiving your advice and
collaborating with many of you.

I invite scholars to visit our centre when in India, interact with us
and deliver lectures etc. To begin with we will soon be conducting a
national workshop on the Ālaṅkārika Rasa Theory and an international
conference/workshop on Tantric studies. Announcements should follow
sometime sooner. The Centre has very limited funding and we look forward
collaborating with other organizations or universities in conducting
events of mutual interest.

This Centre will only function as an administrative node under Manipal
Centre for Philosophy and Humanities (MCPH) for conducting academic
events. The Centre proposes to develop a comparative, multidisciplinary
perspective to study the constant changes in the expressions and
significance of religious practices in the past and in the present. We
want to bring together expertise in specific religions with a
comparative approach that draws on a variety of humanistic and social
scientific disciplines. The Centre will promote interdisciplinary
research, interchange and collaboration focused on religious studies
among faculty members in Manipal and in the wider community through
seminars, conferences and presentation of scholarly papers and lectures.

**Aims and Objectives:**

To establish a first-of-its-kind department in India to facilitate
scholarship, both academic engagement as well as general outreach, on
different religious traditions of India.

To encourage and study interfaith dialogue between different
intellectual, cultural, and literary formulations, both ancient and
modern.

To build Manipal University’s reputation as a platform for innovative
pedagogy in Religious Studies.

To facilitate critical conversations and engagements with the
development of religious thought over different historical periods and
contexts, as well as showcasing the changing relevance of these insights
in contemporary society.

**Projects:**

A resource centre to build collaborations, and develop pedagogy for a
robust model for religious studies in India.

Organize public events including talks, conferences, workshops, and
seminars, on subjects relating to different religious traditions –
Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity and Jainism among others.

Organize lectures by leading national and international scholars.

Introducing short-term certificate courses and courses for extra credits
on relevant topics including advanced and interdisciplinary research
methodology and concerned language courses.

Introducing special courses for scholars training them in exhaustive
academic study of religious traditions in their sources by focusing on
original manuscript materials.

I look forward for your support and cooperation.
