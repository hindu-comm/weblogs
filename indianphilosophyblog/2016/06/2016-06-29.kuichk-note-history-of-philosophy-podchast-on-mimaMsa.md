Quick Note – History of Philosophy Podcast on Mīmāṃsā

Over at *[History of Philosophy without any
Gaps](http://historyofphilosophy.net/)*, Peter Adamson, with Jonardon
Ganeri, has been running a series on [Indian
Philosophy](http://historyofphilosophy.net/india). The last few weeks
have focused on Mīmāṃsā, and the IPB’s Elisa Freschi has been assisting
with the episodes. Next week, episode 22, will feature a conversation
with her, so keep an eye out for that one!
