Book Reviews for the Blog

As the [Indian Philosophy Blog Book Review
Editor](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/book-reviews/), I would like to
invite scholars in the field to write book reviews for the blog. I’ve
listed a few possible books for review here, but please [contact
me](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/book-reviews/) if you have an idea
for a book to review or if you are an author, editor, or publisher with
a book you’d like to see reviewed here.

Other than the first book on this list, I am currently unable to provide
complimentary copies for reviewers. If there is a book that you’d like
to review I can contact the publisher on your behalf.
