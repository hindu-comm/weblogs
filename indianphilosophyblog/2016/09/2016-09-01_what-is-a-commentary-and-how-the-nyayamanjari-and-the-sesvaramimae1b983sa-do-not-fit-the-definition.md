What is a commentary? And how the Nyāyamañjarī and the Seśvaramīmāṃsā do (not) fit the definition UPDATED

**What makes a text a “commentary”?** The question is naif enough to
allow for a complicated answer. First of all, let me note the obvious:
There is not a single word for “commentary” in Sanskrit, where one needs
to distinguish between *bhāṣya*s, *vārttika*s, *ṭippanī*s, etc., often
bearing poetical names, evoking Moons, mirrors and the like.

Sanskrit authors, thus, had in mind a widely different set of texts
which we all bring back to the seemingly single category of
“commentary”. Some of them are chiefly line-by-line or word-by-word
explanations (an illustrious example is Manorathanandin’s commentary on
Dharmakīrti’s PV). Others entail elaborate philosophical disquisitions
(such as Vācaspati’s *Nyāyakaṇikā* on Maṇḍana’s Vidhiviveka). Still
others just comment on a few words or sentences every 10 pages or so
(such as Cakradhara’s *Granthibhaṅga* on Jayanta’s *Nyāyamañjarī*).  
Some of them are part of a longer history, that they fully embrace. This
is especially true in the case of the philosophical *sūtra*s and of
their first *Bhāṣya*-commentary, which tends to be fused in a single
text. This last sentence could also be interpreted as saying that a
sūtra-part was only later extracted out of the respective *Bhāṣya*.  
Vācaspati’s commentary of the *Nyāyasūtra*, for instance, embeds
comments also on its *Bhāṣya* by Vātsyāyana, but typically also on the
*Vārttika* thereon. Others focus only on one text and neglect the
successive history. Śrīprapāduka’s commentary on the same *Nyāyasūtra*,
for instance, explicitly focuses only on it.  
What is constant in all these cases is that a commentary is in close
dialogue with a root text (with or without its commentaries), which
remain(s) its main interlocutor(s).  
This makes the definition wide enough to encompass texts such as the
*Nyāyamañjarī* itself, which comments extensively on some selected
*Nyāyasūtra*s
([Graheli](http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/History-and-Transmission-of-the-Ny%C4%81yama%C3%B1jar%C4%AB-)
2016 contains an appendix with the sūtra numbers and the impressive
amount of pages dedicated to each of them). Similarly, Veṅkaṭanātha’s
*Seśvaramīmāṃsā* comments anew the *Mīmāṃsāsūtra*, programmatically
neglecting the commentary by Śabara.  
Thus, we could sum up the relation “A is a commentary of B” as “B is the
main interlocutor of A”.  
**UPDATE: The relation of “being the main interlocutor” can be more
loosely understood if A and B belong to the same śāstric tradition,
whereas it needs to entail a very close (e.g., page-by-page or
line-by-line) dialogue in order to consider A, which is polemical about
B, a commentary of it.**  
However, the picture may become still more complicated, because a text A
apparently commenting on B may have in fact in view most of all B’s
other commentary, C, so that C, though never mentioned, is A’s main
interlocutor.  
Coming back to the example mentioned above, the *Seśvaramīmāṃsā*
comments on the *Mīmāṃsāsūtra*, but while having constantly in view the
Śabara’s *Bhāṣya* thereon and, more strikingly, Rāmānuja’s *Bhāṣya* on a
different *sūtra*, namely the *Brahmasūtra*. One ends up with a net of
main interlocutors rather than a single one.
