Where is Philosophy?: A Response to Nicholas Tampio

Last week there was a call from political science professor Nicholas
Tampio to narrowly define philosophy as a discipline responding either
directly to Plato’s*Republic*or at least part of a self-consciously
Socratic-Platonic tradition of inquiry. I recommend reading Tampio’s
essay, “Not All Things Wise and Good Are Philosophy,” for
yourself[here](https://aeon.co/ideas/not-all-things-wise-and-good-are-philosophy).
Tampio was responding in large part to a piece from Jay Garfield and
Bryan Van Norden called[“If Philosophy Won’t Diversify, Let’s Call It
What It Really
Is](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/opinion/if-philosophy-wont-diversify-lets-call-it-what-it-really-is.html).”

I find much of Tampio’s essay to be either plain wrong or downright odd.
While Tampio mentions Candrakīrti, he doesn’t discuss Indian
philosophy, which is a shame, I think, because Indian philosophy may
provide several important counter-examples to his claims.

There have already been some excellent responses to Tampio’s article.
See[this collection of tweets from Bryan Van
Norden](http://www.exquisitetweets.com/collection/BryanVanNorden/3486)(one
of the authors of the piece to which Tampio is responding) that offers
some education about Chinese philosophy. See also[this post on
the*Feminist
Philosophers*blog](https://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/2016/09/17/philosophical-vanities/)by
Amy Olberding as well as[her almost sentence-by-sentence response to
Tampio on her personal
blog](http://departmentofdeviance.blogspot.com/2016/09/dod-named-wise-and-interesting.html).
Our very own Malcolm Keating has also written [a post on the
topic.](http://malcolmkeating.blogspot.com/2016/09/whats-in-name.html)

I personally found Tampio’s article so filled with oddity and plain
errors that I could easily write a paragraph or two responding to each
sentence. Olberding has already done something like that, so I will
merely respond to a few of the more confusing and/or erroneous aspects
of the article. I should add that what follows is in the style
of*vitaṇḍā*or pure criticism. I am criticizing Tampio’s thesis, but I
am not attempting to present a counter-thesis about what philosophy is.

Tampio starts by telling the reader that he has published on Islamic
political thought. This is a nice way to inform us that he’s not a
cultural chauvinist, which makes the rest of the piece all the more
bizarre. He inconsistently refers to the Islamic intellectual tradition
either as “thought” or “philosophy” throughout the piece. This would
seem to undermine his thesis unless there’s some subtlety there I didn’t
understand (perhaps ibn Sina and al-Farabi are “philosophers” while
al-Ghazali is a “thinker,” but then there are at least two philosophers
in the Islamic tradition…). The rest of the introduction paragraph
nicely sets out his thesis, strange as it may be.

Then we’re presented with perhaps the strangest and most obviously
erroneous claim:

> “Philosophy originates in Plato’s*Republic*.”

Nobody believes this (except maybe Tampio himself). Even Aristotle said
that philosophy began with Thales in the 6th century BCE (Thales was
apparently[lambasted for being
useless](http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/2015/08/three-uses-of-philosophy.html),
which might be a reason to think he was a philosopher!). Even if you
were to discount the Presocratics and Socrates himself,
the*Republic*is usually classified as one of Plato’s middle dialogues.
Does Tampio mean that*Euthyphro*and*Apology*aren’t really
philosophy? Also, while the*Republic*is justly praised as a great
work of philosophy today, as Plato scholar Julia Annas has pointed out,
it wasn’t really until the 19th century that most people came to see it
as Plato’s*magnum opus*. There are some more odd claims about Plato,
such as the claim that anyone who uses the word “idea” is evincing their
Platonic heritage. Let’s move on to a strange paragraph.

> “I am wary of the argument, however, that all serious reflection upon
> fundamental questions ought to be called philosophy. Philosophy is one
> among many ways to think about questions such as the origin of the
> Universe, the nature of justice, or the limits of knowledge.
> Philosophy, at its best, aims to be a dialogue between people of
> different viewpoints, but, again, it is a love of wisdom, rather than
> the possession of wisdom. This restless character has often made it
> the enemy of religion and tradition.”

I suppose that’s a good thing to be wary of, especially since I doubt
there’s a non-circular way to define philosophy as reflection on
fundamental questions (i.e., “fundamental” = “philosophical”). I also
think philosophy can be humorous, but I take it “serious” here means
something like rigorous or sustained (Zhuangzi and Jayarāśi show us that
philosophy can occasionally be both humorous and rigorous).

It’s odd that philosophy is “a dialogue between people of different
viewpoints” when the whole point of this article is that many of those
people shouldn’t be considered philosophers, a point that[Olberding
makes better than
I.](http://departmentofdeviance.blogspot.com/2016/09/dod-named-wise-and-interesting.html)I
wholeheartedly endorse the idea that, at least etymologically speaking,
philosophy could be seen as the love of wisdom rather than possession of
it. One would hope this would result in some intellectual humility when
it comes to what the love of wisdom might be and where one might find
it.

I’m a bit dubious about the idea that philosophy has “often” been the
enemy of “religion and tradition,” at least in the eurocentric way
Tampio seems to intend. I love teaching Plato’s Socratic dialogues.
Every time I do, I become more confused that so many contemporary
irreligious champions of reason take as their hero a man who heard
voices and repeatedly claimed to be on a mission from a god.

I don’t think it’s particularly wise to discount possible sources of
philosophical illumination just because they’re tainted by whatever one
thinks of as “religion.” If you did so, you’d have to throw out almost
all of Western philosophy before the 19th century. Even the Greek and
Roman Skeptics said you should follow local religious customs, and the
Stoics had theological beliefs. Descartes and Kant talk about God more
than most classical Indian philosophers, even those few, like the
Naiyāyikas, who do endorse belief in a creator deity. It’s interesting
to imagine what the[irreligious and materialist
Cārvākas](http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/)would have said about Plato’s
metaphysical dualism, mysticism, and belief in reincarnation–it would
make for a challenge to religion and tradition!

All of this makes me suspect that people with eurocentric conceptions of
philosophy sometimes don’t understand the history of Western philosophy
as well as they claim to. And most fare much worse when it comes to
understanding the traditions they disparage as non-philosophy.

As critical as I’m being of Tampio, I am glad that he’s familiar with
Islamic philosophy (or thought as the case may be). On that point, I
see no reason to say that al-Ghazali isn’t a philosopher in*some*sense
even if he denies being one in a very particular sense, maybe the same
way that Sextus Empricus, Nāgārjuna, or Zhuangzi could be philosophers
even as they’re deeply critical of almost everything their fellow
philosophers have to offer.

When it comes to Chinese philosophy, Van Norden and Olberding, who are
experts, have already done more than I could to correct Tampio’s errors.
I will add that cherry-picking one quote from Confucius to disparage an
entire 2,500-year-old tradition would be much like this: imagine someone
read[Heraclitus’s](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/)fragment
in which he says that donkeys prefer garbage to gold (DK B9) and said,

> “Well, these Western people don’t really do philosophy… as we all
> know, philosophy is defined in terms ofKauṭilya’s ā*nvikṣikī …*
> Heraclitus, from whom we can generalize to the entire Western
> tradition, is merely offering sagely pronouncements of wisdom, which
> can’t be taken seriously as philosophy because he doesn’t justify
> anything with a *pramāṇa.*“

Tampio ends with

> “But demanding that philosophers treat al-Ghazali or Confucius as one
> of their own is unreasonable, and provides ammunition to people who
> are ready to banish philosophers from their midst.”

His idea is that articles like Garfield and Van Norden’s are giving
ammunition to short-sighted university administrators and politicians
like Marco Rubio (who[fallaciously argued thatwe need “less
philosophers”](http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/2015/11/harmful-fallacies-rubio-and-refugees.html)).
Whether such people are looking at the philosophy series of*TheNew
York Times*websitefor reasons to reduce or eliminate philosophy
departments I can’t say. What’s odd about Tampio’s claim, though, is
that he seems more concerned about the fact that people might point out
the eurocentrism of academic philosophy than whether this might be true
or worth changing or, more importantly, if making
philosophy*less*eurocentric might actually help it survive.
