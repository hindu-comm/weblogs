Philosophical commentaries in ancient India

Commentaries can be manifold in ancient India. They have different
purposes and form, but they all share some characters:

-   they have a given text as their main interlocutor/they are mainly
    about a given text
-   like with Origene’s commentaries, they are a genre in its own right,
    not a minor specialisation for authors at their beginnings ([Sakai
    2015](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10781-014-9235-6),
    section 4, suggests that authors in fact needed to have already
    become acknowledged authorities before being entrusted with the
    honour of composing a commentary on an influential text.)
-   they are characterised by a varied but strong degree of textual
    reuse
-   they allow for significant degrees of innovation (This is evident in
    the case of the Navya Nyāya commentaries on the NS. Outside the
    precinct of philosophy, juridical commentaries often reflect the
    recent juridical developments much more than the original text they
    are commenting upon.)

As for reuse, one might object that reuse is much more present in later
commentaries such as the *Seśvaramīmāṃsā* than in earlier ones, such as
the *Śābarabhāṣya*. However, the ŚBh does indeed quote extensively from
a previous commentator and the fact that contemporary readers do not
recognise many other reuses does not rule out the possibility that
Śabara did in fact extensively reuse but, as it is often the case
throughout Indian philosophy, without marking his reuses, as he could
assume that his audience would have recognised what was happening. In
other words: the seeming increase in the amount of textual reuse from,
e.g., the 2nd c. to the 14th. could be due more to the increase of *our
awareness* of reuse. In this connection, it is worth remembering that:

-   commentaries are also an important source for the retrieval of
    (written or oral) texts which would otherwise be lost

Commentaries bring us back within a close analysis of a text, often even
in an advanced classroom milieu. Thus, they need to evoke important
textual authorities, including the ones which happen to be fashionable
at their time and might have been lost or never recorded in script.

By contrast, commentaries diverge sharply as for other characters. So
much, that even the first item listed above might need to be
re-conceived in a plural form, with texts entangling at the same time
various others, as it can comment on various different texts and discuss
with various others, named and unnamed ones. The landscape of Indian
philosophy (perhaps of all philosophical traditions?) is complex and
invariably entangled.

**What is your experience with the genre of commentaries? Do you have
counter-examples or would you rather agree with my preliminary
assessment?**
