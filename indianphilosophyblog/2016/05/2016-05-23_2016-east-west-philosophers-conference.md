2016 East-West Philosopher’s Conference

In a few days, the [2016 East-West Philosopher’s
Conference](http://hawaii.edu/phil/2016-east-west-philosophers-conference-update/)
will begin in Honolulu, Hawaii. The theme is “place”, but the range of
interpretations of the theme varies from literal to metaphorical.I’ll
be chairing a panel which takes “place” in a more abstract manner. The
speakers include our own Ethan Mills, along with Marzenna Jakubczak and
Amy Donahue:

> The Place of Logic in Classical Indian Philosophy  
> Ethan MILLS (University of Tennessee Chattanooga)
>
> Locating the Self: Between Memory, Attention and Discrimination  
> Marzenna JAKUBCZAK (Pedagogical University of Cracow, Poland)
>
> Putting Words in their Place: Elliptical Completion through

> Malcolm KEATING (Yale-NUS College, Singapore)

> Cannot Mean If It is Global  
> Amy DONAHUE (Kennesaw State University)

Plenty of other good philosophy will be going on–too many talks to list
here. I’ll aim to put up a conference summary here after, and a thread
for people to add their thoughts. In the meantime, I put up a small
anticipatory blog post on my [personal
blog](http://malcolmkeating.blogspot.com/2016/05/quick-note-tantrarahasya-on-ellipsis.html)
regarding my talk, focusing on ellipsis, postulation, and
the*Tantrarahasya*.
