Garfield and Van Norden in the NYT

> . . . we ask those who sincerely believe that it does make sense to
> organize our discipline entirely around European and American figures
> and texts to pursue this agenda with honesty and openness. We
> therefore suggest that any department that regularly offers courses
> only on Western philosophy should rename itself “Department of
> European and American Philosophy.” This simple change would make the
> domain and mission of these departments clear, and would signal their
> true intellectual commitments to students and colleagues. We see no
> justification for resisting this minor rebranding (though we welcome
> opposing views in the comments section to this article), particularly
> for those who endorse, implicitly or explicitly, this Eurocentric
> orientation.
