Online Philosophy Education Including Indian Philosophy

Dear Friends and Colleagues

I’d like to bring your attention to an online resource for teaching
philosophy, including Indian philosophy.

This is the [EPG Pathshala](http://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/) initiative, by
the Government of India’s University Grants Commission. The goal of this
project is to make materials for graduate courses across discipline
freely available to professors and students. Philosophy is one of the
disciplines covered by this project. Philosophy itself is divided into
12 sub disciplines.

Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology and Logic have two levels: a first and
second year level. Each course has a maximum of 40 units. It calls the
courses “Papers” and the lessons “modules.”

I am in charge of the first year course in Ethics ([Ethics
1](http://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/ahl.php?csrno=27)). The scope of Ethics 1
is historical: moral philosophy from ancient times up until the end of
the modern era.

The goal was to provide roughly equal billing to Western and Indian
philosophy.

The site is still a bit buggy, and it is not complete, but I hope it
will be of some use to our community of scholars.

The link to the full site is: <http://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/>

The link specifically to a page with drop down menus for the philosophy
course is: <http://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/ahl.php?csrno=27>

Best wishes,  
Shyam
