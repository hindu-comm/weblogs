Workshop on Rasa Theory: February 2017

A bit of a last-minute announcement (which readers may have already seen
elsewhere). A few months ago, [Mrinal Kaul
mentioned](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/06/14/news-from-manipal-university-a-guest-post-by-mrinal-kaul/)
that Manipal University has established a new Center for Religious
Studies and would be hosting a workshop on rasa theory. This workshop is
now set to convene 13th to 17th of February at Manipal University.
Applications for participation are being accepted until 30th November
2016. [Details here, at Mrinal Kaul’s
blog.](https://kashuradab.wordpress.com/workshop-on-the-rasa-theory/)

Some excerpts from the workshop description:

> This workshop will principally include a close textual reading of
> selections from the *Rasādhyāya* (chapter 6) of the *Nāṭyaśāstra* of
> Bharatamuni—the celebrated work on Indian aesthetics—together with the
> *Abhinavabhāratī* commentary of Abhinavagupta. The discussion in the
> *Abhinavabhāratī* includes a critical overview of the history of
> Indian aesthetics up to Abhinavagupta himself in the tenth century,
> including such thinkers as Śrī Śaṅkuka, Bhaṭṭa Lollaṭa, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka,
> etc. The aim of the workshop is not only to familiarize the
> participants with the principal questions and debates in Indian
> aesthetics, but also to discuss the philological challenges posed by
> these texts with experts in the field. We will therefore work with
> parallel texts and manuscripts in our readings of the
> *Abhinavabhāratī.*
>
> [Professor C. Rajendran](http://crajendran.org/), University of
> Calicut, Calicut will be the principal instructor. We are also
> expecting a few other experts of Indian aesthetics to join us. The
> morning and afternoon sessions will include the readings of the text
> in Sanskrit followed by special lectures in the afternoon. The seminar
> will be held in English and readings will be circulated in advance.
> Special events like Yakṣagāna performance which is a native folk
> theatre form of Malenāḍu region in Karnataka, will be organized
> besides an afternoon excursion to the local Jaina temples in Karkala.
> There also will be opportunities for exploring the incredible richness
> and diversity of the Udupi region.
