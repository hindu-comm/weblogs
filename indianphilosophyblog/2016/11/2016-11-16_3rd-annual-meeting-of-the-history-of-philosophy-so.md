3rd annual meeting of the History of Philosophy Society (HOPS)

A call for papers for the 3rd annual meeting of the History of
Philosophy Society (HOPS) has been released. The topic of the meeting is
*pleasure*. The organizers have specifically mentioned that they are
looking for a wide variety of approaches and historical/geographical
foci. It may be a good place for some of us to share our work with the
broader History of Philosophy community.
