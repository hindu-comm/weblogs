Interview with a “free range” Indian philosopher

Over at [Daily
Nous](http://dailynous.com/2016/07/11/free-range-philosophers-new-site/),
Justin Weinberg points to a
[website](https://freerangephilosophers.com), created by Derek Bowman,
that is hosting a series of interviews with “free range” philosophers,
people who are academically trained as philosophers but have chosen to
do something else with their careers. An interview there with [Bharath
Vallabha](http://theroughground.blogspot) caught my eye as being of
interest to our readers. A description:

> Bharath Vallabha received his PhD in philosophy from Harvard
> University, and he held a tenure-track position in philosophy at Bryn
> Mawr College before leaving academic employment. In this wide-ranging
> interview, we talk about the experience and challenge of integrating
> his familial introduction to Indian philosophy with his academic
> training in Western philosophy, the philosophical necessity of
> pluralism, his reasons for leaving a tenure-track position, and his
> take on the challenge and promise of being a philosopher outside of
> the academy.

Here’s one part of the interview:

> DEREK: Would it have been helpful for you as a student if there were
> classes in Indian philosophy, or generally non-western philosophy,
> alongside classes on Aristotle and Kant?
>
> 
>
> BHARATH: Yes, absolutely. In fact, more than helpful: it was a
> necessity for me as a student which my education failed to provide.
>
> 
>
> Pluralism is sometimes criticized as “identity politics”. The idea is
> that if someone like me wants classes in Indian philosophy, it must be
> because I care more about affirming the Indian part of my identity
> than pursuing truth. This is nonsense. My desire to have classes in
> Indian philosophy wasn’t so that I can mindlessly affirm Indian
> culture, but so that I could think critically about my background.
>
> 
>
> I grew up with concepts key to Indian culture and philosophy such as
> dharma, moksha, atman, reincarnation and so on. As a student at
> Cornell and Harvard I wanted to think critically about these concepts,
> so as to make up my mind about what I think about them, and to reject
> them if necessary. I was happy to learn Plato and Kant. But when I
> tried to apply the western philosophy I learnt to the concepts I grew
> up with, I hit upon questions such as: Is the concept of reincarnation
> the same in Plato and the Gita? How does dharma relate to the
> categorical imperative? Is atman the same as a Cartesian soul? The
> questions didn’t seem like only translation issues, but philosophical
> questions in their own right. And yet there was no one to turn to for
> help. It was impossible to tell how to connect western philosophy to
> Indian philosophy when the latter was not even taught.
>
> 
>
> Sometimes it is said, “But Indian philosophy is taught in Indian
> studies departments, or the Divinity school, etc. Stop complaining
> about philosophy departments: go study it where it can be found.” Of
> course there are wonderful philosophers in these departments. But the
> issue is not where experts in Indian philosophy are located. It is how
> to foster systematic dialogue between traditions such that it is
> evident to students what it means to connect Indian philosophy with
> western philosophy, and vice versa. It is not a matter of taking some
> classes “over there”, but of seeing that a cosmopolitan education
> requires a dialogue between the world’s traditions.
>
> 
>
> As long as it is treated as normal that Indian philosophy is taught
> only in Indian studies departments and not in philosophy departments,
> it will be natural to think that Indian philosophy is local and not
> universal. People who equate pluralism with identity politics naively
> assume that the current institutional set up is tracking some essence
> of Indian philosophy; that while western philosophy can be separated
> from its culture (“it has its own department!”), Indian philosophy
> cannot be (“it is part of Indian studies!”). It is really time to get
> past this simple minded adherence to the status quo, and think
> critically about fostering greater dialogue.
