Recent conference on Yoga at Munich

On behalf of Karl-Stephan Bouthillette, main conference organizer:

On Friday 22 July, LMU (Munich) welcomed Prof. Ujjwala Jha and Prof.
V.N. Jha, two well known Indian Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā scholars, to discuss
the Yoga Sūtras. It is a rare event to have these two established
scholars discuss issues of the Yoga Sutras from their own disciplinary
and philosophical perspectives, a dialogical and hermeneutic approach
that has never been undertaken so far within a Western academic context,
and not even in India, where their previous attempt to do so did not
unfold so far.

At a conference day on Saturday the 23rd, general issues on Yoga were
broadly discussed by 7 speakers coming from various fields of
Indological and Religious Studies research. On the 25th, they began an
intensive week-long reading of the Yoga Sūtras with the Jhas:
interpreting the Yoga Sūtras through a traditional style of Sanskrit
commentary following the lines of Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā exegesis.
