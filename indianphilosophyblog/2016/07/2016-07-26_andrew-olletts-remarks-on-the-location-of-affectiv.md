Andrew Ollett’s remarks on the location of affective responses

An important historical shift in Indian aesthetics is from concern with
the *character* as the locus of emotional responses (*anubhāva*s) to the
*spectator* or “audience” as the locus. Andrew Ollett provides a concise
reflection on that shift.

> In his *Ten Forms* (*Daśarūpa*), the tenth-century scholar Dhanañjaya
> takes the rather counterintuitive position that the “responses”
> (*anubhāva*s) of traditional aesthetic theory—typically the outward
> physical signs of an emotion, such as trembling, crying, and so
> on—belong to the *reader* or *spectator*, and not to the character who
> is represented (the *anukārya*). This position follows the revolution
> in aesthetic theory, as Sheldon Pollock
> has[recently](https://www.amazon.com/Rasa-Reader-Aesthetics-Historical-Sourcebooks/dp/0231173903)
> described it, introduced by Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka, the ninth-century theorist
> who sought to understand how aesthetic response is produced in us.
> Dhanañjaya’s commentator Dhanika makes it very clear that the standard
> “affective responses” are actually to be understood as *our* responses
> to reading a work of literature, or watching a play: it is we who tear
> up, gasp, and so on. But this was a relatively new idea, and according
> to the older theory, it is the character—or even the actor who
> represents her—who is thought to have these “affective responses.”
