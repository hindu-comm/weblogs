Jonardon Ganeri, “Why philosophy must go global”

Jonardon Ganeri of NYU gave a lecture at Stony Brook University on March
2, 2016 entitled “Why Philosophy Must Go Global.” You can click on the
video below to watch.

In this lecture Prof. Ganeri draws from Jain *nayavāda*and Madhyamaka
Buddhism to argue for “a pluralism of epistemic stances” (not to be
confused with epistemicrelativism). He maintainsthat philosophy
graduate programs must do a better job of presenting multiple
approaches, including the teachings of non-western philosophical
traditions.

This might be seen as a kind of mission statement for Stony Brook’s new
MA program, “History of Philosophies, East and West.” It is a joint MA
program sponsored by our Department of Philosophy and Department of
Asian & Asian American Studies. We are still accepting applications for
our inaugural class of fall 2016. More information [is
