Journals for Indian Philosophy

If you are working on a paper related to Indian philosophy, which
journal(s) do you approach for publication? How do you decide which is a
good venue for your work?

There are a few philosophy journal rankings around (for example, the
[Brooks
Blog](http://the-brooks-blog.blogspot.sg/2011/09/journal-rankings-for-philosophy_29.html),
dating back to 2011–there is some
[discussion](http://dailynous.com/2015/08/03/journal-rankings-useful-guest-post-by-thom-brooks/)
about whether to update it).These rankings, though, tend not to reflect
the major journals for Indian philosophy. Nor do they reflect the often
interdisciplinary nature of our work (one might wish to publish in more
philological/Indological journalsfor part of one’s research
project).Andrew Cullison has an[ongoing
survey](http://www.andrewcullison.com/journal-surveys/)which tracks
journals, including*Journal of Indian Philosophy, Comparative
Philosophy,Philosophy East & West,* and some others. The data gives a
sense of turnaround time and acceptance rates. However, they don’t tell
us which journals are open to Indian philosophy.[Warp, Weft, and Way
has a list on its main page](http://warpweftandway.com), though not all
of these may be relevant for Indian philosophy.

Matt Dasti and I thought it might be a good idea to compile a list (not
a ranking) of journals which are open to work in Indian philosophy,
broadly construed. While many journals indicate openness to multiple
philosophical traditions (for instance, [*Mind* has recently made such
an
announcement](http://dailynous.com/2016/04/19/prominent-philosophy-journal-broadens-scope/)),
it would be useful to know which ones genuinely practice it.In the
comments, would you mind helping us out by posting:

-   **Journal titles:** where you have published work related to Indian
    philosophy;
-   **Referee process:**whether the process was anonymous,
    double-anonymity, etc.;
-   **Kind of work:**how you would characterize the work, as succinctly
    and specifically as possible (history of Buddhist philosophy,
    philological notes on the Nyāyasūtra, comparative philosophy
    focusing on Continental and Vedānta, etc.)
-   **Date:**when the work was published.
-   **Initial response rate:**how long from submission to acceptance
    (or R&R)?

Note that the relationship to Indian philosophyshould be construed
broadly. While simply including a footnote on Buddhism in an analytic
paper on the mind-body problem wouldn’t count, if your work engages with
Indian philosophy (classical or contemporary) in a robust sense, include
it.
