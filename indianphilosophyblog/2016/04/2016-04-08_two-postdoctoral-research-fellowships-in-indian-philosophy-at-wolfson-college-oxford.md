Two postdoctoral research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford



See the following mail from Richard Sorabji about two PostDoc research
fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford. The advert
and further particulars are attached. Application deadline is May 13th.

Yours Alex

Dear Friends,  
I am attaching an advertisement and further particulars for two 2-year
postdoctoral research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson
College Oxford, applications and references due by 13 May to start in
Wolfson this October, 2016. The required part of the research concerns
the application of Indian Philosophy to certain socio-political issues
listed here by the Berggruen Institute, some more and some less closely
connected with Indian Philosophy, because the philosophies of other
cultures are also being accommodated on other sites.  
The reason why some postdoctoral experience is required is that these
posts are more generously funded than Wolfson Junior Research
fellowships, so as to guarantee substantial research in the area.
Wolfson was envisaging typically between 3 and 10 years from the
relevant PhD. But if equivalent experience can be claimed, candidates
should not hesitate to make a special case. Provided the substantial
research in this area is produced, postholders are free to publish on
their other interests as well. Other schools of Indian Philosophy can be
researched besides the ones I have listed as examples.

Do let me know if you know of good candidates.  
All good wishes  
Yours

Richard
