Introduction to Philosophy and/or Philosophy of Mind

I am considering to co-teach a course with a philosopher at the
University of Florida, one in which we’d look at Indian and Western
writings on the same topics, e.g. mind, self, epistemology, etc. These
interdisciplinary courses are given special funding by the university.

Have any of you taught a course like this? Would you be willing to
describe how you organized it?

Right now I am thinking I would assign books like Perception by Matilal,
or Chakravarthi’s Non-Realism, or Ganeri’s Concealed Art of the Soul,
and he (my co-conspirator) would assign texts from a well-known
contemporary thinker dealing with similar topics (AJ Ayer, Searle, and a
few others came up). The point in doing so would be to not only see what
the views were in Indian/West, but to see how the arguments are made by
contemporary thinkers. What do you think? We are in a formative stage
any suggestions would be of great help and greatly appreciated.
