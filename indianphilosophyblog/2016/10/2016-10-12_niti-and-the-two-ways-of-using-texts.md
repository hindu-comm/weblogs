Nīti and the two ways of “using” texts

On Sunday I was reading Sundarapāṇḍya’s *Nītidviṣaṣṭika*, an interesting
collection of *āryā* verses on the subject of *nīti* (something like:
how to act in the world), and later on caught up (very belatedly) on
part of the
[debate](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/09/20/where-is-philosophy-a-response-to-nicholas-tampio/)
occasioned by Garfield and Van Norden’s
[piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/opinion/if-philosophy-wont-diversify-lets-call-it-what-it-really-is.html?_r=0)
in the New York Times. This experience triggered two thoughts.

1.  Surely the *Nītidviṣaṣṭika*, and the whole ocean of *nīti*-oriented
    verses that it floats in, is precisely what the defenders of the
    Eurocentric *status quo* in academic philosophy want to keep out,
    for a whole host of reasons. It is, first of all, in the wrong
    **tradition**, since it’s not a “footnote to Plato.” (I’m referring
    not to Whitehead but to Nicholas Tampio.) It’s in the wrong
    **genre**, since it’s not an essay or a dialogue but a collection of
    epigrammatic *subhāṣita*s. It’s not **argumentative**, in the sense
    of debating positions, but presents its advice as settled
    conclusions. It is **conceptually light**, in the sense that it
    never fully articulates what is meant by the key concepts it
    invokes—*guṇa*s, *doṣa*s, *sajjana*, *durjana*, and so on. So maybe
    all of the defenders of the Eurocentric status quo, like Anthony
    Flew, Nicholas Tampio, and some of the others who chimed in in
    response to Garfield and Van Norden’s piece, are accidentally right
    when it comes to the exclusion of a vast domain of Indian ethical
    thought. Accidentally, of course, because most of them have never
    read a word of Indian *nīti* literature.

2.  Then I thought: Wait a minute. There is plenty of thoughtful
    scholarship (see two examples below) that looks at Indian *nīti*
    literature as representing a vibrant tradition of thought about
    fundamental ethical questions, rather than as a pile of
    unphilosophical banalities. One direction that this rehabilitation
    has taken (in van den Bossche and Mortier) is reading it as “virtue
    ethics,” an approach that has been associated mostly with
    neo-Aristotelians like Alasdair MacIntyre. Another direction
    (represented by Daud Ali) reads it in broadly Foucauldian terms, as
    concerned with the formation of ethical subjects. Now I don’t really
    know whether either of these directions are taken seriously by
    philosophers *stricto sensu*; I would guess that the people arguing
    most strongly for restricting the definition of philosophy to what
    philosophy professors in Europe and America currently do might see
    these directions as passing (or past) fads. But I think that Daud
    Ali makes a very important point in emphasizing the *use* of
    *nīti*-type verses. These verses were written to be recited at the
    right moment (*avasare*), in situationally-appropriate contexts, and
    discussed with others. They were “diacritics” of ethical life.
    Rather than seeing them as unsystematic or insufficiently theorized,
    we can see them as one part of a comprehensive and coherent ethical
    system.

A few months ago, Amod Lele
[outlined](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2016/01/17/on-the-very-idea-of-buddhist-ethics/)
a very pertinent distinction between (I paraphrase slightly)
“decision-oriented” and “capacity-oriented” approaches to ethics. The
former is concerned with formulating explicit criteria and procedures
for ethical action, and hence anyone, regardless of his or her
background, could make an ethically-appropriate decision if they formed
the correct judgements and they followed the right procedures.
Utilitarian calculi and Kantian maxims, so often opposed to each other,
are similar in this respect. Amod rightly points out that ethical
traditions that are not “decision-oriented” in this way are usually
classified as “miscellaneous” or “other,” or even as “anti-theoretical,”
but at least some of them are implicitly or explicitly
“capacity-oriented.” Virtue Ethics and Foucault’s conception of ethics
are explicitly so. They deny that there is an “anyone” in ethics (they
might even say that the idea of a neutral subject is a bourgeois myth).
They maintain that ethical decision-making and action always presuppose
being formed as a subject with particular capacities, dispositions,
habits, and so on.

The distinction between decision- and capacity-oriented approaches to
ethics is obviously a theoretical one. But I think it probably maps onto
disciplinary and methodological differences, or perhaps better,
differences of outlook. The notion that ethical problems admit of
solutions that can be demonstrated in the way of a logical proof, and
the allied notion that “ethics” is a domain in which universal
principles can be discovered and applied, very naturally leads to what I
will call a “philosophical” use of texts. That is, we read texts because
they might have something to say about these universal principles. The
questions we ask of them are questions like: What is the argument here?
Does the argument work? In contrast, the notion that ethical action
arises from dispositions that can only be acquired through cultivation
and education leads to a “historical” use of texts. Of course, we can
read texts for their arguments, but we can also read texts for the
visions of social and ethical life that they represent. We can ask
questions like: Who are the subjects addressed here? What are they
supposed to actually do? How do the social, the ethical, and the
aesthetic relate to each other? How would these texts have been used?
Although these different uses of texts pertain to very different sets of
questions, I’m not convinced that the “historical” use of texts is
unphilosophical—which is a mild way of saying that attention to the ways
in which ethical systems are constructed and lived in history is exactly
what philosophy needs.

I would be remiss not to give an example of the kind of literature that
occasioned these thoughts. Here is a verse collected by Sundarapāṇḍya,
which is probably not without relevance to this discussion:

*bahv api tattvaṃ jñātvā nṛṣu bahumāne pravartamānena  
balavattareṇa viduṣā lokajñāne prayatitavyam*

It‘s not enough to know a lot.  
If he wants to have influence,  
and find respect among his colleagues,  
a scholar needs to cultivate worldly wisdom.
