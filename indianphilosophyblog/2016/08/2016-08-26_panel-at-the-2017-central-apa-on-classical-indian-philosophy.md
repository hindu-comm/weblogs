Panel at the 2017 Central APA on Classical Indian Philosophy

Prasanta Bandyopadhyay is putting together a panel on classical Indian
philosophyfor the central meeting of the American Philosophical
Association this March. He is eager to populate it with qualified
speakers. Time is of the essence here, however. If anyone is interested,
kindly let him know, sooner than later. Prasanta has given me the
impression thathe is casting a fairly wide net in terms of what sort of
topics would fit.His email is: psb@montana.edu . He can provide more
details as required.
