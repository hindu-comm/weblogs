dravya and avayavin in Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika

As a result of a recent conversation with Roy Perrett, I had a
question.  
(Incidentally, many of you will know, but some may not, that Roy
Perrett’s ‘Introduction to Indian Philosophy’, Cambridge University
Press, has beenout since the beginning of the year. It will be a very
important book for students and teachers of Indian Philosophy classes,
for people working in other areas of Philosophy, and for people doing
research on Indian Philosophy.)

The question — about Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika ontology:  
When we speak of a pot, say (no surprises there as to my choice of
example!), can we characterize it just as a substance possessing
qualities, i.e. by appeal to two things: substance and qualities (and a
relation of inherence between them), or are we dealing with three
things? By ‘three things’ I mean the substance, the qualities and the
‘whole’ (avayavin). I.e. is the pot-avayavin firmly distinguished from
the pot-dravya or can we equate them? (Roy suggested that we have to
distinguish them since the whole is composite and divisible, but the
substance is neither.)
