“But is Indian thought really philosophy?”

What to do, then? Doctrinally, one can try to explain that it *is*
indeed philosophy (use of syllogistic arguments, argumentative style,
dialogues, interest in logic…). This will probably not be enough, so
that one might want to go for the sociological approach:

In this sense, public figures like Ganeri are probably very influential
through their sociological impact (“he appears to be a philosopher, so
what he does must be philosophy”) beside through their written work.  
As for this blog’s mission, should we focus on acquiring the
sociological status of “philosophers”, beside continuing to focus on
understanding Indian philosophy and trying to convey how interesting it
is?
