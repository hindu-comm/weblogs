Again on the non-sentience of herbs in Indian Philosophy

I have already
[argued](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2015/10/27/book-review-of-hinduism-and-environmental-ethics-by-christopher-g-framarin-reviewed-by-elisa-freschi/)
[elsewhere](https://www.academia.edu/8544445/Systematizing_an_absent_category_discourses_on_nature_in_Pr%C4%81bh%C4%81kara_M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81)
that I am firmly convinced that South Asian philosophers upheld that
plants are non-sentient, possibly against a common belief in their
sentience.  
  
A further evidence had escaped my attention until now, namely
\\emph{Pūrva Mīmāṃsā Sūtra} 1.2.35, where an opponent says that Vedic
mantras are meaningless, since they address *acetana* ‘insentient’
beings. The example that follows in the commentaries departing from
Śabara’s one is that of a mantra addressing herbs, *oṣadhi*s. The
*siddhāntin* replies in *sūtra* 46, and defends the meaningfulness of
mantras, but still agrees with the assumption that herbs are not
sentient. The same point is repeated throughout Mīmāṃsā and also in the
Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta commentary by Veṅkaṭanātha on the same sūtra. This
adds other examples of mantras addressing insentient beings, such as
“Hear, o stones!”, further clarifying that the opponent really groups
together herbs and stones or other inorganic elements.

The sentience of plants is one of the topics I keep on thinking of. You
can read my last post about it
