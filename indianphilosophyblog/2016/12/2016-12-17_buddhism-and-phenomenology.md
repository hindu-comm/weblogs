Buddhism and Phenomenology

Victoria Lysenko has been so nice as to alert me about a recent workshop
on Buddhism Phenomenology, to which very interesting authorities on both
topics (ranging from Dan Zahavi to “our” Christian Coseru) contributed.
They realised an interactive poster through which you can access texts
and audios of all speakers. I failed to reproduce it here, but you can
access it directly from the website of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
[here](http://eng.iph.ras.ru/7_8_11_2016.htm). Let us know what you
think of this interesting attempt by leaving a comment below.
