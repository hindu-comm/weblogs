Puzzles in Sanskrit Philosophy

To paraphrase a contemporary philosopher: ‘examples stick around in
philosophy in a way they don’t in other fields such as linguistics.’
There is some truth to this. I cannot imagine a philosopher today who
doesn’t know Frege’s famous problem: ‘the morning star is the evening
star’ or Russell’s: ‘The King of France is bald.’

In this blog post, I want to talk about a puzzle (or, more accurately: a
set of problem-data) that played a crucial role in a debate on
philosophy of language in premodern South Asia for nearly a millennium.
This specific set of data was first attested in Maṇḍanamiśra’s
*Bhāvanāviveka* (composed c. 680-690 CE?) and remained a key puzzle for
Sanskrit intellectuals thinking about the semantics of verbs and
theories of action for a millennium.  
  
If we think about events expressed by verbs, such as: ‘one makes a pot’
(*ghaṭaṃ karoti*) or: ‘Theodore cooks’ (*devadattaḥ pacati*), we can
identify two elements as candidates for the verbal suffix’s
referent(s):  
i) physical movement (*parispanda*)  
ii) mental exertion (*yatna*), i.e., making a conscious effort  
  
On the one hand, the very fact of these two potential candidates
presents a challenge for a unified theory of the verbal suffix’s
semantics. However, what about events where only one of these two
candidates is present? How do we develop a unified theory of the
semantics of verbs if there is no one consistent element across *all*
verbs?

We first find this puzzle in Maṇḍana’s *Bhāvanāviveka* via the set of
problem-data:  
  
1. Verbs which express conscious effort, but not physical movement:  
i) One sits \[in place\] (*āste*)  
ii) One sacrifices (*yajat*e) \*For Mīmāṃsakas, the verbal root *yaj-*
directly signifies the mental commitment/decision on the part of the
sacrifice’s patron (*yajamāna*) to perform a sacrifice, not the
performance thereof.  
iii) One cognizes (*jānāti*)  
  
2. Verbs which express physical movement, but not conscious effort:  
i) The riverbank falls (*kūlam patati*)  
ii) The chariot goes (*ratho gacchati*)  
iii) The fire burns (*agnir jvalati*)  
  
This puzzle/data set is presented early in the *Bhāvanāviveka* (vss.
4-5), but clearly informs the position of a real interlocutor, against
whose position Maṇḍana articulates his own conclusion at the tail-end of
his essay (vs. 47 ff.), as the interlocutor’s position addresses
precisely this puzzle. I translate the interlocutor’s position:

*On that, some say:  
  
\[Śabara\] understood mental exertion (*prayatna*) when he said: ‘one
should strive’ (*yateta*) in his commentary \[on 2.1.1\].  
Due to the frequent usage of verbs to \[describe\] insentient things,
there is no understanding of the linguistic usage as figurative. 47.*

*\[Śabara\] has shown that the verb’s referent is mental effort
conducive to the occurrence of the result \[when he said\]: ‘one should
strive (*yateta*) so that something comes into being.’ The usage,
however, of a verb \[to describe\] an insentient thing is based on
figurative usage. \[But\] we don’t understand it as figurative due to
its frequent usage \[in this way\].*

The interlocutor’s attempt at a unified theory of the semantics of the
verb’s suffix is that it only directly signifies mental exertion
(*prayatna*), and the interlocutor accounts for cases where we only
understand physical movement (*parispanda*) is to treat these as
indirect signification/figurative usage (such as in: ‘the chariot
goes’). However, says the interlocutor, we don’t overtly cognize these
cases as figurative, due to our high frequency usage of verbs in this
way (think like a dead metaphor –> even though it’s not the literal
meaning, we treat it as such).  
  
To this account, Maṇḍana’s answer is:

*However, this answer hinges upon the establishment of \[mental exertion
and not physical movement as the directly signified sense\], and there
is no proof of that when our cognition \[of both\] is the same and when
we lack another reason, because it isn’t possible to preclude that we
could take it the other way.*

*Therefore, \[we\] believe the meaning of the verb: ‘one makes’
(*karoti*) has as its nature the commonality of a cessation of inertia,
and the arising of an awareness of that occurs in both cases. 48.*

*For the meaning of ‘one makes’ (*karoti*) is a cessation of inertia,
due to the absence of an awareness of action in something that is inert.
And an awareness of falling from inertia is twofold: due to conscious
effort in the self (*ātman*) and due to physical movement in something
other \[than the self\].  
  
*Maṇḍana’s solution to articulate a unified theory of the verbal
suffix’s semantics is to find a commonality between mental exertion and
physical movement, and present *that* as the suffix’s directly signified
sense. This commonality is the cessation of inertia. Whether the chariot
begins to physically move or I begin to mentally think about something,
this constitutes a cessation of inertia. The only difference is the form
that cessation of inertia takes, physical or mental. Thus, on Maṇḍana’s
account, both mental exertion and physical movement can be treated as
directly signified (these are the two ways inertia ceases), even though
we’re only admitting the verbal suffix to have one directly signified
sense (the cessation of inertia).  
  
Although Maṇḍana’s specific position here doesn’t gain a huge following,
Maṇḍana sets the stage here for many subsequent intellectuals to carve
out their own positions against his (more on this in relation to the
Naiyāyikas in my dissertation, I suppose).  
  
This puzzle remains relevant for a millennium. Sanskrit intellectuals
nearly one thousand years later such as Raghunātha Śiromaṇi and the
Grammarian revivalist Koṇḍabhaṭṭa thought about this very puzzle in
articulating their own new theories — although perhaps through
second-hand sources.

Turning away from this specific case, the use of philosophical puzzles
in premodern South Asia raises further intellectual-historical
questions, such as: how are philosophical puzzles approached
methodologically by these Sanskrit intellectuals? What is the role and
status of these puzzles in relation to the positions that these Sanskrit
intellectuals develop?  
  
A good answer is probably nuanced and context-dependent. In the
case-study explored above, Maṇḍana develops his own new position as a
unitary theory of the semantics of verbs in relation to the problematic
data set. However, Maṇḍana’s solution is still carved out within the
fold of certain Bhāṭṭa commitments (e.g., the archetypal Vedic
injunction: *svargakāmo yajeta* has the semantic structure: *yāgena
svargam bhāvayet* ‘one should bring heaven into being via sacrifice’).
Likewise, Maṇḍana’s *Bhāvanāviveka* is the first extant hostile
engagement with Prabhākara’s theory of the command (*niyoga*): Maṇḍana
is not simply developing his theory of the semantics of verbs in a
vacuum, but within a very specific context while navigating many other
goals and agendas that I didn’t touch upon in this post.  
  
However, some centuries after Maṇḍana, in the context of the Prābhākara
and Naiyāyika debate on philosophy of language, the game is not one of
developing a new position in relation to puzzles, but rather of
deploying puzzles and problematic data against the opponent to undercut
their positions and to show the superiority of one’s tradition’s
established doctrine by squaring it with the data.  
  
This shift in how puzzles are used appears to be tied to the nature of
the debate: we’re now in a context where Prābhākaras and Naiyāyikas are
refining established doctrines, not developing radically new theories.  
  
Anyways, these latter thoughts probably need some further refinement …
don’t quote me on this …  
  
If anyone has any thoughts about this or other philosophical puzzles
they’ve encountered and thought about, do let me know 🙂
