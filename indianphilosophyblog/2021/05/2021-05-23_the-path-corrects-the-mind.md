The path corrects the mind

This week I continue [my
response](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/sufferings-mental-causes-are-not-merely-conventional)
to Patrick O’Donnell’s
[comments](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-326401)
disputing [my
claim](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)
that in classical Indian Buddhism “the causes of suffering are primarily
mental”. The discussion [last
time](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/sufferings-mental-causes-are-not-merely-conventional)
was abstract and theoretical, but it has practical consequences – which
bring us back to Engaged and Disengaged Buddhism. Patrick has an
interesting discussion here which I think is unfortunately confused by
terminological problems. He says:

> If the problem is in our heads, what about the story of the poisoned
> arrow? One removes the arrow without inquiring into who shot it, why,
> etc. Of course we may inquire into such things later, after the fact
> (the metaphysics and psychology if you will).

The thing is, the Shorter Māluṅkya Sutta’s [story of the poisoned
arrow](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2012/08/in-praise-of-questions-which-tend-not-to-edification/)
is not a warning against seeking an understanding of “metaphysics”, let
alone of psychology. The “questions that tend not to edification” in
that sutta are largely *cosmological* questions: about the eternality or
finitude of the cosmos, whether a Tathagata exists after death. The
unedifying questions are described as “positions that are undeclared,
set aside, discarded by the Blessed One” – which psychological questions
pretty clearly are not. The craving and ignorance in our heads *are* the
poisoned arrow that we have to get out first, before we can worry about
the cosmological questions of who shot it.

Patrick continues:

Here I think we may have some translation difficulties. *Paññā*/*prajñā*
is most commonly rendered “wisdom”, but it is not *phronēsis*, wisdom
about how one acts in the world. Discussions of *paññā* have to do with
the nature of reality (including *paṭicca samuppāda*) and with seeing
that nature correctly (*yathābhūtadassana*). It is not merely assent to
propositions, for it affects the mind in other ways:one who sees things
correctly is not attached to them. But neither is it about finding the
right thing to do in a situation; it is not about *acting* wisely
(though that might follow from it). In [my
dissertation](http://loveofallwisdom.com/other-writings/) I rendered
Śāntideva’s *prajñā* as “metaphysical insight” because that is what he
is talking about when he talks about *prajñā*, and as far as I can tell
the same is true for Buddhaghosa and other Pali authors. The proper
perception that constitutes *paññā* is something that is indeed in our
heads, and therefore it is at least *two*-thirds of the path that are
mental.

I also don’t think “ethics” or “acting ethically” is a good translation
of *sīla*. I view ethics as concerned with how human beings should live
as a whole, not merely how we should act, such that mental cultivation
falls under its purview as well (I sometimes describe my work as “ethics
of emotion”). But even if we take the analytical view that “ethics” is
about how we should act, *sīla* in the Pali texts is not about “acting
ethically” in the sense that modern Westerners understand that term,
where it has to do with active benefit to others. It is nearly always
phrased in terms of abstention: what one should *not* do. (The Five
Precepts are the most famous formulation of the content of *sīla*, but
other longer formulations are similarly concerned with abstention.) In a
sense it is not about action at all, but about *in*action, refraining
from action. In the fifth chapter of Śāntideva’s Bodhicaryāvatāra, this
restraint of one’s action is practised primarily with the intent of
controlling the mind, and I have not seen anything different in the Pali
texts: the primary purpose of *sīla* throughout these texts is indeed to
alleviate the mental causes of suffering.

Finally, Patrick continues:

I know of nowhere in Pali literature where any advice to this effect is
to be found, and there’s a reason for that. It is the sort of view that
is often associated with altruistic Mahāyāna texts, but strikingly, it
is often not even found there. The view that Patrick describes here is
basically the one Stephen Jenkins attributes to Śāntideva in his [“Do
bodhisattvas relieve
poverty?”](http://kusala.online-dhamma.net/%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99/%E5%8D%97%E5%82%B3%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%9C%96%E6%9B%B8%E9%A4%A8%20Theravada%20Buddhism%20E-Library/054%20%E9%9B%9C%E8%AA%8C%20Magazine/Journal%20of%20Buddhist%20Ethics/JBE/www.jbe.gold.ac.uk/7/jenkins001.html),
in which “material goods have priority as a prerequisite for moral
well-being”. For, Jenkins correctly notes, Śāntideva’s bodhisattva does
give gifts to the poor.

But in response to Jenkins I showed, in my [“The compassionate gift of
vice”](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2013/11/14/santideva-on-gifts-altruism-and-poverty/),
that that is not how Śāntideva *understands* those acts of giving. The
material gifts do not have priority; they are not a necessary condition
for relieving suffering. Rather, they are a way of getting the recipient
to listen to the bodhisattva’s teaching, compared to bait on a fish hook
– and analogous to the way Śāntideva says bodhisattvas intentionally
become prostitutes to draw men to them. For that reason, while
Śāntideva’s bodhisattva indeed gives to the poor, he also gives to the
rich! Even Śāntideva’s altruism is about getting other people to improve
their minds – because, as he says, “all fears and immeasurable
sufferings come from the mind alone.”

I’ll close by noting that I have recently come to feel more persuaded by
Jenkins’s view *constructively*: it probably *is* the case that some
suffering is genuinely caused by material deprivation, and that it is
harder to be virtuous on an empty stomach. I just don’t think that
that’s the view found even in the altruistic Śāntideva, let alone
anywhere in the Pali Canon. There, the causes of suffering are, indeed,
mental.
