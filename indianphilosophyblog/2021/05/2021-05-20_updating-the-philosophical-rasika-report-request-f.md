Updating the Philosophical “Rasika” Report: Request for Assistance

The Indian Philosophy Blog is planning to update the Philosophical
Rasika Report, last compiled in 2017, for [North
America](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/10/29/the-philosophical-rasika-report-listings-of-ph-d-programs-in-indian-philosophy-2017-edition-part-i-north-america/)
and
[Europe](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2017/11/02/phd-programs-in-indian-philosophy-in-europe-2017-edition/).
We are also hoping to add a South Asia list, as well as other
international programs.

If you work in Indian Philosophy and have been hired at a *PhD-granting*
program since 2017 or are part of a PhD-granting program who has hired
someone working in Indian Philosophy, I invite you to help us with this
project by emailing the point person below. (You may also email to let
us know about retirements and other changes.)

**North America, Andrew Nicholson**, andrew.nicholson@stonybrook.edu  
**Europe, Elisa Freschi**, elisa.freschi@gmail.com  
**South Asia & beyond**, Malcolm Keating, c.malcolm.keating@gmail.com

Thanks in advance for your assistance in keeping this resource up to
date.
