Sāṅkhya on śyena

The Sāṅkhya reached its acme before Mīmāṃsā and its position is
therefore attacked as a useful departure point for deontic discussions,
especially around the case of the śyena in Mīmāṃsā texts (in the
following, I will refer to its representation in Veṅkaṭanātha’s TMK).

Interestingly, although the school accepted the authority of the Vedas,
Sāṅkhya authors did not insist on their being necessarily consistent and
instead highlighted that the prohibition to perform violence should not
be overturned, not even in case of sacrificial violence. Accordingly,
they understand the sequence:

-   1\. One should not perform violence on any living being
-   2\. If one desires to harm one’s enemy, they should sacrifice
    bewitching with the śyena

as implying that 1. invalidates 2. Interestingly, Sāṅkhya authors are
ready to go as far as stating that this applies also to the following
sequence:

-   1\. One should not perform violence on any living being
-   3\. One should sacrifice an animal within the agnīṣomīya sacrifice

Whereas all Mīmāṃsā authors agree that 2. should not be fulfilled (but
out of different reasons than the one put forward by Sāṅkhya authors),
no one among them would agree in extending this position to 3.

Sāṅkhya authors are therefore presupposing that Vedic commands do not
necessarily form a consistent whole and, more importantly, that
prohibitions are \\emph{unrestricted in their application} (see TMK
5.78). This is connected to a point we will see developed by Maṇḍana,
namely the incommensurability of the bad. Transgressing a prohibition
involves accumulating *pāpa*, i.e., bad karman, and this bad output
cannot be compensated by any good result one might gather. Prescriptions
contrasting with prohibitions are automatically suspended, since
prohibitions are unrestricted and always prevail. Only prescriptions not
contrasting with prohibitions are valid.
