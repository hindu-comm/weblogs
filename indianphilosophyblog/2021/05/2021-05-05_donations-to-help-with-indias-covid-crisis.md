Donations to Help with India’s COVID Crisis

Readers of this blog are most likely aware of the [huge COVID crisis
unfolding in India at the
moment.](https://apnews.com/article/india-coronavirus-health-41a6a064b0d22b0ed4d2d1753e4ff31c)

I recently discovered [this crowdsourced list of organizations working
in India that are seeking donations from those of us outside
India.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ca5YH5YUtp7Qe63sVNX1SlepQcvzc4RCwLhMBvTJyE/edit?fbclid=IwAR3WHuo_gKQbsQPfwm4-vp050qYX0FYmzTHEdbF7X5W-zlVgAZdJrrSd_tY)
Please consider donating if you can.

Readers in India, I hope you will remain safe during this difficult
time.
