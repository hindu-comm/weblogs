Suffering’s mental causes are not merely conventional

disputing [my
claim](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)
that for most classical Indian Buddhists “the causes of suffering are
primarily mental.” I think they’re worth responding to at length, so
I’ll take two posts to do so: this week on the theoretical (metaphysical
and psychological) claims about the causation of suffering, next week on
their practical implications.

In the original post I say the idea is from “the Disengaged Buddhists”,
but will refrain from that phrasing in this particular post because it
probably begs the question currently at issue. I do think that the idea
is subscribed to by the Buddhists whom I refer to in [my
article](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2019/11/17/disengaged-buddhism/)
as disengaged, and that it is a key reason for their disengagement.
These include Śāntideva, Aśvaghoṣa, and – perhaps most importantly for
the present discussion – the authors of most if not all of the Pali
Canon.

Let me first make a methodological point: for now, at least, I will be
speaking exegetically and not constructively. That is, I am aiming to
clarify the viewpoint of these classical Buddhist thinkers on the
question of suffering’s causes, not to state my own position, since I do
disagree with them on a number of questions (including in the [original
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-327392)).
In this post (and most of next) I am concerned with what they think
about suffering (*dukkha*), not with what I think.

Patrick
[begins](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-326401)
by saying “I have always understood the so-called roots of suffering in
Buddhism two be twofold: inordinate desire (hence craving) and
ignorance.” It seems to me that that is already just to say that the
causes of suffering are mental right there: as I [pointed
out](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-327392)
and I don’t think Patrick disputed, inordinate desire and ignorance are
both mental. This point is in line with the Second Noble Truth, which
identifies the origin (*samudaya*) of *dukkha* in *taṇhā*, craving (or
inordinate desire if you wish), and makes no mention of any other
origin. It is also in line with the opening verse of the Dhammapāda,
which proclaims from the beginning that

> phenomena (*dhamma*s) are preceded by mind (*manas*), led by mind,
> made of mind. If one speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering
> follows them as the wheel follows the ox’s foot.

In case one didn’t get the point, the second verse repeats:

> phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, made of mind. If one
> speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness follows them like a shadow
> that does not leave.

Patrick clearly knows the Pali texts well enough to be aware of all
this. How then can he claim, as he does, that it is “egregiously
mistaken to prioritize, stress, or focus on ‘the mental'”? [He
notes](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-326401),
and I grant, that “changes in our material conditions and experiences
can have effects on our mental and emotional outlook and dispositions…”
But in response to that [I
argue](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-327392):
“One could then specify that the mental causes of suffering in turn have
their own non-mental causes, and that seems plausible to me – but it
wouldn’t change the fact that the causes of suffering themselves are
mental, whatever might cause those causes.”

It is in [Patrick’s response to
this](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-327487)
where I think the argument gets particularly interesting. Here his
comment is worth quoting at length:

> Dependent origination is about the causes of suffering: they are
> variable, multiple, and interdependent, that is why it is misleading

The “conventionally” usage is interesting in its allusion to the [two
truths or ways of
speaking](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/05/mere-convention-vs-seeing-correctly/),
conventional (*sammuti/vohāra*) and ultimate (*paramattha*). Just as
speaking of a person is merely a convenient designation to refer to what
is more accurately a set of aggregates, I think Patrick is saying, so
likewise, saying that suffering is caused by craving is merely a
convenient designation to refer to a more complex set of causes
identified by the scheme of dependent origination (*paṭicca samuppāda*).

The problem with that approach, I think, is this: nowhere in any Pali
text that I am aware of is there any indication that the Four Noble
Truths – including the Second – are merely conventional. The Four Truths
are not in the personal language that usually characterizes the
conventional (“*my* suffering comes from craving”); they are in the same
impersonal phrasing as the abhidhamma. As far as I can tell, the Truths
are always considered *nītattha*, of clear meaning, rather than
*neyyattha*, requiring interpretation. That the origin of suffering is
in craving is no mere simplification; it is no more of a conventional or
provisional statement than is any statement of dependent origination. So
the fact that every causal element is connected does not supersede the
fact that suffering is caused by the mental factor of craving (and
perhaps ignorance along with it). If Patrick can find me anything in the
first millennium of Pali Buddhism that really says the Four Truths are a
mere shorthand or convenient designation, or less fundamental than
dependent origination, then I’ll be both impressed and startled, for
that would indeed overturn a great deal of my understanding of the
tradition. As far as I know, nobody seriously claims the Truths are
merely conventional until Nāgārjuna comes along – but he says that
dependent origination is merely conventional too!

So I don’t think it is misleading to assert that, according to the
suttas and other Pali texts, the causes of suffering are mental. They
are, and that’s one of the most important ideas in the canon. The truth
that suffering’s origin is craving does not invalidate the truth of
dependent origination – but just as much, the truth of dependent
origination does not invalidate the truth that suffering’s origin is
craving. A reading of dependent origination that says “suffering’s
origin isn’t *really* craving, that’s just a shorthand for more complex
causes” is a misreading.
