Night school in Indian philosophy

If you know anyone who’s looking for an introduction to Indian
philosophy, David Nowakowski of the [Merlin](https://merlinccc.org/)
philosophy community is starting a series of Zoom-based classes tonight,
and over coming Wednesdays. Classes are at 6:15-8:15pm MST (8:15-10:15
pm EST, 6:45am-8:45am Indian time – I’d list GMT but this is not likely
to be a convenient time for our European readers!) The classes are
introductory, not intended for specialists, but they come at a very
modest price (U$15-50 per session sliding scale) for anyone who might be
interested in the field and doesn’t know where to begin. [Click for
