Further thoughts on Sanskrit philosophical commentaries

The main thing about Sanskrit philosophical commentaries is that they
are the standard way of doing philosophy. For centuries, they were
almost the only way of doing philosophy. After Maṇḍana, one starts
seeing monographs dedicated to a specific topic. Still, even those take
often the form of verses+autocommentary and do not become the mainstream
form of philosophy. Until today, Sanskrit philosophers think and write
in the form of commentaries. This has several implications:

1.  They do not value originality per se. I am probably preaching to the
    converted if I say that one can make incredible innovations while
    writing a commentary (and in fact, this routinely happened, with
    sources of knowledge being removed from the list, new accounts being
    added, completely different explanations being offered etc.).
    However, the genre “commentary” involves the habitus of intellectual
    humbleness. One does not praise one’s innovations and rather locates
    them in a tradition of exegesis of truths that were already
    available for everyone, if only one had paused long enough to see
    them.

2.  Lower level explanations about word-meanings, sentence-syntax etc.
    are mixed with high level elaborations. This means that even the
    most self-confident intellectual will not disdain intellectual
    labour, because the two are contiguous.

3.  Philosophy is constantly seen as a dialogue with one’s intellectual
    predecessors. In fact, and unlike in other philosophical traditions,
    Sanskrit commentaries typically take the form of dialogues among
    possible interpretations.

4.  The constraints of the commentary open the way for the never-ending
    play of possible interpretations. Abhinavagupta lists 18 (if I
    remember correctly) interpretations for the word anuttara in his
    Paratriṃśikāvivaraṇa and everyone is aware of the amplifying
    potential of commenting on words and texts.

In later times, I would add two further features of philosophical
commentaries:

1.  Commentaries tend to take into account more and more networks of
    texts rather than single texts

2.  Consequently, one comments not only on the texts of one’s schools,
    but also on influential texts one wants to appropriate (think of
    Śaṅkara’s inaugurating the use of commenting on the BhG and the
    Upaniṣads, as well as Abhinavagupta’s commentary on the Triṃśikā).
    Still later, one comments on the texts on one’s adversaries as a way
    to refute them, like Madhusādana Sarasvatī did in the case of
    Vyāsatīrtha.
