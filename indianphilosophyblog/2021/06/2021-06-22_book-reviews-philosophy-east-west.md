Book reviews: Philosophy East & West

As I was [answering a
question](http://dailynous.com/2021/06/21/philosophy-journals-book-review-policies-and-practices/#comment-424649)
at the *Daily Nous* blog about book reviews, it struck me that a quick
announcement here encouraging potential reviewers (and authors) to be in
touch with me might be a good idea.

I’ve taken over the South Asian Philosophy book review editor position
from Matt Dasti (since last year), and I am always looking for
reviewers. Below is a summary of our book review process, as well as a
list of books for which I’m currently seeking reviewers. If you are
interested in reviewing, please email me at c.malcolm.keating@gmail.com,
along with a CV and brief explanation as to why you’re a suitable
reviewer. If you have a new/forthcoming book, email me after confirming
it [fits the journal’s scope.](https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/pew/)

**Book Reviews in Philosophy East & West**

*PEW* publishes book reviews as an online supplement with the print
edition. They are typically 2,000 words long, though, depending on the
book, this can be flexible, in consultation with the book review editor.
For important books which merit a roundtable, in consultation with the
book review editor and journal editor, we can extend the review length
and invite replies. Below is a summary of the book review process, from
initial commission to publication.

**Initial Commission**

The book review editor solicits a reviewer for the book based on
appropriate areas of expertise. In consultation with the reviewer, they
set a submission deadline and target length.

**Book Copies**

The publisher will, at the book review editor’s request, send review
copies to the reviewer. These may be print or e-book copies, depending
on reviewer preference and publisher availability. Increasingly,
publishers prefer to send e-book versions rather than hard copies.

**Review Writing**

The structure of the review itself is at the discretion of the reviewer.
However, excellent book reviews typically include a synopsis for the
reader, brief discussion of the philosophical and scholarly conversation
that the book is intervening in, along with evaluative comments. Unless
a longer, thesis-driven review has been agreed-upon with the editors,
book reviews should not present the reviewer’s own position about a
topic, but limit themselves to evaluating the book’s merits and demerits
with respect to the aims that it sets out.

1.  *A chastening* administers discipline over anything from flaws in
    book structure to diacritical errors.
2.  *A review-splaining* solely demonstrates the reviewer’s own
    intellectual superiority and above-average intelligence.
3.  *A revised proposal* describes in overwhelming detail the book on
    the subject which the reviewer would have written, if they were
    given the chance.
4.  *An homage* skips over discussion of the book; it just gushes over
    the enjoyment of reading it.
5.  ***A good review*** succinctly represents the book, independent of
    evaluation. It also offers a point of view to engage with the book
    critically.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

**Manuscript Guidelines**

All articles and features are printed in English. If a contribution is
written in another language, the original and an English translation are
requested.If a contribution is submitted by an author for which English
is not a native language, the manuscript must be edited by a native
speaker before submission.

The system of transliteration of foreign terms and names should be
consistent within each article and should conform to generally accepted
practice.

Manuscripts should be prepared according to the specifications of
the*Chicago Manual of Style,*16th edition (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 2010). Authors are responsible for the accuracy of all
quotations and for supplying complete references. All copy, including
block quotations, end notes, and reference lists, must be double-spaced,
and in Times New Roman font. All footnotes must be converted to
endnotes.

**Submission to Book Review Editor and Revisions**

Once the review is complete, it should be sent to your book review
editor as a Word document for editing and review, accompanied by a PDF
(to ensure no diacritical or Asian language errors are introduced). The
editor will review the submission for content and style. They will
return it to you with suggested changes. At any point in the process,
the editor may reject the review for not meeting *PEW* standards.

After incorporating revisions, send the revised document to the editor,
who will vet it again. Once editor and reviewer are satisfied, the
review will then go to Editorial for preparation.

**Submission to Editorial**

When the book review is in final form, the reviewer should send it,
along with a headshot of the author in high resolution, in a \*.jpg
format, to [pew@hawaii.edu](mailto:), cc-ing the book review editor.
Send the review in PDF and Word format to ensure no errors are
introduced in diacritics or Asian languages.
