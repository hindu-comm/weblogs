Frustration where mind meets world

I find myself repeatedly returning to the question I asked earlier this
year: “[Is the problem in our
heads?](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)”
That is: for Buddhists, especially classical ones, is the fundamental
human problem located in our minds, or in the world? I have found that
my thinking on this question has already changed even just since my
posts on the topic
[last](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/sufferings-mental-causes-are-not-merely-conventional/)
[month](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/the-path-corrects-the-mind/).

In those posts, I defended [to Patrick
O’Donnell](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/04/18/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/#comment-326401)
my claim that in classical Buddhist texts the causes of suffering are
primarily mental. As I’ve thought on the question a bit further, I have
come to realize that that is not quite right –though even so, the
revision does not lead to the [ethical
consequences](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/the-path-corrects-the-mind/)
that Patrick [or Ron
Purser](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)
would hope for.

For [my book
project](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2020/08/resolving-cliffhangers-in-a-book/)
I’ve been exploring Śāntideva’s key concept of *daurmanasya* –
etymologically “bad-mindedness”, probably best translated “frustration”.
Śāntideva warns us that this frustration is the root cause of *dveṣa*
(hostility or anger), which is in many respects the most serious problem
of all and leads to untold suffering. About it, he asks the memorable
question:

> If there is a remedy, then what’s the point of frustration?
>
> But if there’s no remedy, then what’s the point of frustration?
>
> BCA VI.10

But Śāntideva doesn’t stop there. He also tells us where frustration
itself comes from. It is born from the causing of what is undesired and
the destruction of what is desired (*aniṣṭakaraṇāj jātam iṣṭasya ca
vighātanāt*, BCA VI.7). What we’re seeing there is an interaction
between two phenomena: an external (worldly) event and our mental
desires. And he spells out the connection more clearly in the Śikṣā
Samuccaya:

> The destruction of what is desired, and intense attachment
> (*abhiṣvaṅga*) to happiness: from these two comes frustration. From
> it, anger and faint-heartedness.
>
> ŚS 179

In these passages the problem is in *two* places, or perhaps more
accurately at the *intersection* of two places: where mind *meets*
world. There is the worldly event, and there are the desires that it
goes against – and our intense attachment, our
[craving](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/sufferings-mental-causes-are-not-merely-conventional/).
The frustration comes when the world bumps up against our desires.

That is to say that Patrick O’Donnell was right in a sense: it is not
*just* mind that is causing us to suffer, it is also world. (And thus
[Sallie King is not quite
right](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)
to say “the problem is in our minds, not in the world.”) If the world
never destroyed what we desire and never caused what we do not desire,
then we could avoid suffering without changing our minds.

The problem, of course, is that the world doesn’t work that way and
never will. This is Aśvaghoṣa’s point when he dramatizes the
bodhisattva, the Buddha-to-be, leaving his father’s palace. King
Śuddhodana has promised his son every pleasure, has done everything in
his power to grant his son’s desires. The king also tells his son that
it is his dharma, his duty, to rule. But the young Siddhārtha replies:

> I will not enter the penance grove, O King, if you will be the surety
> for me in four things. My life shall not be subject to death. Sickness
> shall not rob me of my health. Old age shall not strike down my youth.
> And misfortune shall never plunder my wealth.
>
> Buddhacarita V.34-5 (Olivelle translation)

The request is hardly made in good faith. The bodhisattva knows the king
cannot promise him any of these. And that is the point. The world
ultimately frustrates our deepest desires through sickness, old age and
death, in a way that neither an absolute king nor a social democracy can
stop. Any alleviation of suffering that comes from fixing the world is
minor at best. The world and the mind do meet to cause suffering
together. But the difference between the two is that the world *cannot
be fixed*, no matter how much power one has at one’s disposal. *The mind
can.*

It is at *that* point that I think [Sallie King remains
right](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/is-the-problem-in-our-heads/)
about the classical texts and Purser and O’Donnell wrong. Mind and world
interact to cause our suffering, but according to the classical texts,
fixing the world does not fix the suffering. Only fixing the mind does
that. And so Śāntideva’s next line in the Śikṣā, after the one quoted,
proposes the solution: “Nonattachment (*anabhiṣvaṅga*) toward happiness;
non-resistance (*avaimukhya*) toward suffering.” (ŚS 179) So Aśvaghoṣa’s
Buddha is not moved by the multiple entreaties, and rejects kingship for
the monkhood. There is little to be gained by changing the world to
bring it more in line with our desires. On this point, I think King is
right and I stand by my [previous
claim](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/05/the-path-corrects-the-mind/):
the *solution*, according to the classical Buddhist texts, is in our
minds.
