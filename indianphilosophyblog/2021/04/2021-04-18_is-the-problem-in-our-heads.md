Is the problem in our heads?

A key idea that I’ve stressed from the [Disengaged
Buddhists](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/11/disengaged-buddhism-article-is-published/)
is that the causes of suffering are primarily mental – especially the
“three poisons” or “unwholesome roots” of craving (*rāga*), aversion or
hostility (*dveṣa*/*dosa*) and delusion (*moha*) – and that therefore
changes in material conditions of life will do relatively little to
solve them. Engaged Buddhists reject this latter idea, since they take
changing the material conditions as essential. What has struck me
recently, though, is that they reject the idea in ways that are
different, and sometimes even opposite – each of which still,
surprisingly to me in some ways, seems to accept that *rāga*, *dveṣa*
and *moha* are indeed where the key problems of human existence lie. I
see this point especially in comparing the different views expressed by
Ron Purser and Sallie King.

Recall from [my discussion of Purser’s
book:](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2019/12/in-defence-of-mcmindfulness/)
Purser agrees that Buddhist mindfulness seeks to eradicate “greed, ill
will and delusion” (*McMindfulness* 20), but then objects to “a
fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness, that the source of people’s
problems is found in their heads”, as opposed to the “systemic,
institutional and structural causes” of suffering and stress. (38)
Purser advocates that people instead turn their focus outwards, beyond
their heads, to the “the conditions that cause us to suffer… from a
political point of view.” (249)

King, meanwhile, responds to apparently disengaged texts like the
Ādittapariyāya Sutta (Fire Sermon), which claims that ” the instructed
noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms…
towards the ear… towards the mind….” and notes in response that it still
focuses its critique on the three poisons, which she agrees are mental.
I quoted this passage of King’s [last
time](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2021/04/rejecting-santidevas-ethical-revaluation/)
in a different context:

> If these three poisons are indeed the root of the problem, then *the
> problem is in our minds, not in the world.* We can free ourselves of
> duḥkha by practicing Buddhism in such a way that we rid ourselves of
> this craving, hatred, and delusion. This has nothing whatsoever to do
> with leaving the world and everything to do with transforming
> ourselves, here and now. (*Socially Engaged Buddhism* 43; emphasis in
> original)

Notice the contrast and disagreement between the two about where the
problem lies! Is the problem in our minds, or not? I think there’s a
really interesting comparison to be made between Purser’s and King’s
approaches here. We can elucidate it by spelling out a deductive
compound syllogism that I think underlies much of the Disengaged
Buddhist view:

1.  The fundamental problem that we need to solve consists roughly of
    rāga, dveṣa and moha (however we might translate these terms).
2.  If the fundamental problem is rāga, dveṣa and moha, then the
    fundamental problem is in our minds, not in the world.
3.  Therefore the fundamental problem is in our minds, not in the world.
4.  If the fundamental problem is in our minds and not in the world,
    then solving the fundamental problem requires fixing our minds
    rather than fixing the world.
5.  Therefore we should fix our minds rather than fix the world.

Now notice: Purser and King both appear to accept premise 1, that these
three poisons – however one translates them –are the key problem in
Buddhism, and they appear to accept this premise as their own
constructive view. Neither of them accept the conclusion, 5; they both
want an engaged Buddhist view that does focus on fixing the world. But
they reject *different parts* of the intervening premises. King accepts
2 and 3 – “the problem is in our minds, not in the world”; it appears
that she must therefore reject 4, in order to continue rejecting 5. But
*Purser* specifically rejects 3, the claim that accepts, “that the
source of people’s problems is found in their heads”, as a tenet of
“neoliberal mindfulness”. This appears to be because he *accepts*
premise 4, as King does not: he realizes that if the problem *is* with
our minds, then the minds are what really need fixing, and this ancient
Buddhist idea is too “neoliberal” for him. So it would appear that he
must also reject premise 2, the premise that King accepts. It is an odd
rejection to me, because I’m not sure how one could get to the idea that
*rāga*, *dveṣa* and *moha* are *not* primarily “in our heads”, but it
does seem implicit in what Purser has written.

My point here ties to a broader point underlying the [Disengaged
Buddhism
article](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2019/11/17/disengaged-buddhism/).
The point of that article was not to reject Engaged Buddhism but to be
clearer about our innovations, what it is in traditional Buddhism that
we accept and do not accept. Here, neither Purser nor King spell out
their rejections of the middle premises in the syllogism, and as a
result, they do not explain their reasons for rejecting those premises.
I think that such explanations would be just the sort of thing that an
intellectually sophisticated Engaged Buddhism needs.

And where do I stand on the question at hand myself? Well, unlike Purser
and King I do accept *both* premise 2 and premise 4: if the fundamental
human problem is the three mental poisons, then the problem is in our
minds, and if the problem is in our minds, then solving the problem
requires fixing our minds. I also think that premise 1 is impeccably
Buddhist and pervades most classical Buddhist thought, at least in South
Asia from Thailand to Tibet. But I don’t fully accept premise 1 myself –
and therefore I don’t fully accept 3 or 5, though I’d accept them all
*partially*. Unlike many classical Buddhists, I accept worthy goals in
life [beyond the removal of
suffering](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/beyond-the-removal-of-suffering/),
and for that reason I don’t think the three poisons are *the*
fundamental human problem. We have a lot of other problems – isolation
from love and community, [finding our authentic
selves](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2018/10/an-invisible-ideal-that-we-cherish/),
and, yes, taking care of basic needs like food and medicine, without
which we cannot even *get* to solving our mental problems. To the extent
that activism is a good human activity, I think it is so above all in
dealing with those *other* problems; it is much less helpful in dealing
with the classically Buddhist problems of craving, hostility and
delusion, each of which I suspect political engagement may [tend to
exacerbate](http://loveofallwisdom.com/blog/2017/10/the-political-path-vs-the-buddhist-path/).
