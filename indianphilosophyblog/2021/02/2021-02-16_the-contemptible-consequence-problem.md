The contemptible consequence problem

Hello again, this is [Szymon](https://szymonbogacz.com), a PhD student
researching the Dharmakīrtian approach to liar paradox. According to
this approach—you can find more about it in [my previous
post](http://indianphilosophyblog.org/2021/02/08/dharmakirti-and-liar-paradox/)—the
liar sentence is ambiguous, unbelievable, and cannot express a warranted
belief.

There’s a logical problem with the Dharmakīrtian approach I want to
discuss today. In the next post, the last in the series, I will sketch
some answers to this problem and share some general observations on the
relationship between Dharmakīrtian epistemology and logic.

The logical problem comes from Tom Tillemans and I call it the
contemptible consequence problem. What is it? In classical logic,
there’s a rule, the so-called contemptible consequence rule. It says
that if a sentence implies its own negation, then this sentence has to
be false: (*A*→¬*A*)→¬*A*. The problem is that we could seemingly
know that the liar sentence is actually false if we were to reason
according to this rule.

How this reasoning goes? Consider this argument:

1.  Suppose that we cannot know whether ‘this sentence is false’ is true
    or false. (This is the Dharmakīrtian thesis.)
2.  ‘This sentence is false’ implies that it’s not the case that ‘this
    sentence is false.’
3.  Say that*P*abbreviates ‘this sentence is false.’ By the means of
    classical logic, we can reason as follow:
    1.  *P*→ \~*P*formal
        representation of 2,
    2.  (*P*→ \~*P*) → \~*P*the contemptible
        consequence rule,
    3.  \~*Pmodus
        ponens*from A. and B.
4.  We know that it’s not the case that ‘this sentence is false’ because
    it follows from (3). So, we know that ‘this sentence is false’ is
    false. Contradiction between 1. and 4.; so, 1. must be false.

Before we look into this argument in more details, let me explain some
logic lurking in its background.

The guiding idea behind the contemptible consequence problem is that the
inference from a contradiction with own words—a sentence implying two
impeding beliefs—to the truth of its negation is guaranteed by the
contemptible consequence rule. Let me show you that, for any
proposition*A*, (*A*→ not-*A*) → not-*A*has to be true no matter
whether*A*is actually false or true.Importantly, ‘→’ is material
implication. It means that *A*→*B*expressions are false if and only
is*A*is true and*B*is false, and they are true otherwise. Not-*A*is
true if and only if*A*is false.

Let’s look at the contemptible consequence rule again. If*A*is true,
then not-*A*is false. If so, then*A*→ not-*A*is false. Consequently,
because not-*A*is false, (*A*→ not-*A*) → not-*A*is true.
Alternatively, if*A*is false, then not-*A*is true. If so, then*A*→
not-*A*is true and because not-*A*is also true, (*A*→ not-*A*) →
not-*A*is true as well. Consequently, (*A*→ not-*A*) → not-*A*is true
no matter whether*A*is false or true.

Now we see how the logic in the background of the problem works.
However, that doesn’t answer the epistemological question how deferring
to the contemptible consequence rule justifies the belief that the liar
sentence is actually false. Let’s unpack the 1.-4. argument step-by-step
how it answers this epistemological question.

The first step assumes the central thesis of the Dharmakīrtian approach
to liar paradox. Given that the liar sentence is a contradiction with
own words, we cannot know that it is true or that it is false.
Generally, the whole argument is a*reductio*. It assumes something to
be true, derives a contradiction from the assumption, and concludes that
that the assumption has to be false.

The second step introduces a fact about the liar sentence’s meaning. For
a Dharmakīrtian, the liar sentence*implies*two contradictory sentences
just like ‘my mother is barren’ implies two sentences. The sentence ‘my
mother is barren’ implies that ‘this person has a child’ and ‘this
person cannot have children’. The liar sentence implies that ‘the liar
sentence is true’ and that ‘the liar sentence is false’. This is indeed
what Dharmakīrtian account says about the liar sentence’s meaning.

The third step is a logical argument. It starts with a formal
representation of the fact about the liar sentence’s meaning described
in the second step. It represents it as a material implication. Then,
using the contemptible consequence rule and *modus ponens*, it derives
the liar sentence’s falsity.

The fourth steps concludes that, given the logical argument in the steep
three, we can*know*that the liar sentence is false, contrary to what
the Dharmakīrtian approach says. We know it because any proposition that
implies its negation has to be false no matter whether it’s actually
true or false. Consequently, assuming the Dharmakīrtian approach to liar
paradox leads to a contradiction and so the Dharmakīrtian approach is
false.

You might not be bought into the contemptible consequence problem
immediately, so let me motivate it a bit now.

Standardly, the liar sentence is a focal point of study of logic. As
I’ve mentioned in my previous post, the liar paradox tells us something
important about truth and logical rules. In contrast, for
Dharmakīrtians, the liar sentence is primarily an epistemological
phenomenon inviting a question what we can justifiably believe about it.
If you are interested in how logic and epistemology interact, as I am,
solving the contemptible consequence problem is a good way to illuminate
this interaction.

I have several answers to the contemptible consequence problem. Do you
have yours? Are you convinced by the 1.-4. argument? Let me know in the
comments!

In my next post, I will sketch some of my answers to the problem and
briefly discuss the general relationship between logic and Dharmakīrtian
epistemology.
