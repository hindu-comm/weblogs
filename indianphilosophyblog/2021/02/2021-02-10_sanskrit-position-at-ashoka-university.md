Sanskrit position at Ashoka University

Ashoka University is seeking to appoint a Sanskritist, at either the
Assistant Professor or Associate Professor level. The application
deadline is March 15th.

Application details are given here:  
https://facultypositions.ashoka.edu.in/JD/Sanskrit_JD_20-21.pdf

Note that this is a different position from the one in Indian Philosophy
that I posted about on January 3rd.
