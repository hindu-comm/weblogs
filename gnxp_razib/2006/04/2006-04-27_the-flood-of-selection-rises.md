The flood of selection rises

Over at John Hawks, [Has the dam broken on mtDNA selection?](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/bazin_2006_mtdna_selection_diversity.html). I donâ€™t know if this matters that much scientifically since non-human [phylogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography) tends to be more cautious than the field of historical human population genetics, but it matters *a lot* for the public which has been habituated to a steady stream of mitochondrial data being interpreted by popularizers and the press since [African Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Eve).
