Who da man?!?!

Via [grrlscientist](http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/) here is my [EgoSurf](http://www.egosurf.org/search.php?search=razib&resource=gnxp.com&savesearch=1&e-g=1&c-g=.com&c-y=.com&c-m=.com&ds=1) result: 5715.  
You can check me: [![](https://i0.wp.com/www.egosurf.org/images/link1.gif?w=640)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.egosurf.org/images/link1.gif?w=640)](http://www.egosurf.org/search.php?search=razib&resource=gnxp.com&e-g=1&c-g=.com&c-y=.com&c-m=.com&ds=1 "Look at ME!").  
Since this uses google I think that explains the [high showing of grrlscientist](http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/04/know_your_place_1.php) and the low rank of Glenn Reynolds. I have noticed that some blogs are high driven by referrals from other blogs and others by by search engine traffic. My non-*Seed* [weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/) has always been driven by a large percentage of search engine traffic, and links come in from diverse sources (online class syllabii for example). More political blogs might be deriving their traffic from a tighter circle of sites and so don’t come up as high as they should. Additionally, commentary on political topics doesn’t tend to be highly relevant to google searchers in the long run, so an old post on a science blog might be far more interesting than an old post on a political blog.
