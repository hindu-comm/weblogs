Where are the living Neandertals?

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/neandertalbaby-753208.jpg)

The post that dealt with [the aliens who landed on Flores](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/04/whatwho-are-hobbits.php) has shifted toward [discussing](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/114393822812838459/) where living Neandertals (or post-Neandertals?) might reside (or what people they are). Please place your “nominations” here (I have no idea myself)….

On a related note, Anthropology.net [has a post](http://anthropology.net/forums/anthropology/physical_anthropology/neanderthal_culture) on Neandertal culture, with special reference to the Chatelperronian complex.

Also, [Diana](https://letterfromgotham.blogspot.com/) suggested to me once that [Eva Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Green) kind of has the Neandertal look going, so which side is sim, Swede or French?

**Update:** I misquoted Diana. I looked at the email, and she just pointed to [this page](http://hollywood.weblog.com.pt/arquivo/2004/07/) (not totally work safe) and noted that some of the women, especially Julia Stiles, looked kind of “primitive.” Eva Green was on that page as well.
