What/who are the "Hobbits"

[Steve](http://www.isteve.com/) says that Greg has a new theory about the hobbits of Flores. Anyone have a guess? I’m a lot less likely to believe they are what the Australian team says they are after the principal [floated the idea they were from Australia](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/hobbits-down-under.php). Call it conditional probability based on credibility.

You might want to check out [Kate Wong’s recent post](http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=hobbit_news_part_2&more=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c=1&tb=1&pb=1) over at Scientific American. My idea is that the hobbits were alien humanoids of some form who crash landed. This explains how they could be microcephalic and still produce twins: non-Terran cognitive packing is different. Ultimately their technology which reprocessed Terran food stuffs to be compatible with their own biochemistry broke down beyond repair and so they died off naturally. The next question is: where were they from?

Update: Suomalaiset ovat Neandertals (ja [Conan O’Brien](http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-14-obrien-finland_x.htm) myÃ¶skin).

Update II: Cari lettori meridionali–come mai non bollite il manzo?

Update III: Thomar putki boro!

Update IV: Je m’appelle Robert. En garde!!! Animaux!

Addendum: Jaakkeli? Or neandertalinihminen?
