Shout out for a good textual smackdown on the molecules

On my [other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/) someone is [asking](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/raldanash/114431020506461399/#973022) about genetics & evolution texts. Specifically they were wondering about the order in which to read [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933069/geneexpressio-20), [Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20) and [Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20/). *That* was actually the order I suggested, the first book is more basic and broader, while the two latter texts are more specific. In fact the last book is to some extent an elaboration of just one chapter in [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933069/geneexpressio-20). Additionally, I recommended [Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/041212971X/102-3545529-1501708?n=283155) if you want to take the “next step” in specialization (the author is a G-matrix fiend).  
But, we’re only exploring one dimension of biospace here. Does anyone have a good recommendation for a text on molecular genetics with a slant toward evolution? I have [Molecular Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934634/geneexpressio-20/), but that’s getting a bit out of date now. I’ve started to check out [Human Molecular Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0815341822/geneexpressio-20/), but the focus is obviously a bit narrow.  
Also, I do think it is worthwhile for people to be familiar with the “classics,” from R.A. Fisher’s [Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/) to Sewall Wright’s [Evolution and the Genetics of Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226910385/geneexpressio-20/). Although I guess you could just read [Robert Skipper](http://drrob.typepad.com/hpb_etc/)….  
**Addendum:** For the *Homo* obsessed [Evolutionary Human Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0815341857/geneexpressio-20/) is the way to go, but I think the reading experience will be a *lot richer* if you have a less specialized and more basic work under your belt.
