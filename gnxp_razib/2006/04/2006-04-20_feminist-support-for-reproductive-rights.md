Feminist != Support for Reproductive Rights

I suppose I shouldn’t be too surprised to read that the blogger who runs [Pandagon](http://pandagon.net/2006/04/20/patriarchal-imperialism-on-crack/) has [come out](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2006/04/19/wombs-for-rent-cheap/#comment-41638) against surrogacy which, in effect, means she’s against gay men being able to have children together because in doing so they would have to involve a woman’s uterus and her argument is that “Surrogacy is the wet dream of the patriarchy” which leads her to conclude that “I’m opposed to surrogacy outright.”

It’s very interesting to watch the ideological inconsistencies of feminist principles batter against each other. It’s no surprise to me that I’m a stronger supporter of reproductive rights than feminists who obsessively filter the issue in terms of how it relates to “THE PATRIARCHY.” It should be interesting to watch their responses to the growing mindshare of [Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis) and the choices that will present with the onset of genetic modification technologies.

This is what happens when you keep your eye fixed unwaveringly on what “THE PATRIARCHY” is up to, you kind of forget about other groups’ interests. I just can’t see how gay men will have children without the use of a surrogate, that is, not until we develop the [artificial uterus](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000867.html), which of course will open up a whole can of worms for feminists – should they support the right to fetal extraction or fetal extinction. If they can’t point a finger at “THE PATRIARCHY” where, of where, will they ever find the principles to guide their feminist dialogue?

**UPDATE:** [Ilkka Kokkarinen](https://sixteenvolts.blogspot.com/2006/04/honey-i-picked-up-our-new-baby-today.html#links) takes on the Leftist objections to outsourcing surrogacy.
