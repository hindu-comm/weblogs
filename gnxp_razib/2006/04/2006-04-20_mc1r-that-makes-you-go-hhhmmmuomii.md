MC1R that makes you go hhhmmmuomii….

Now, we know that Europeans seem to be [light in skin color](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/race-is-skin-deep.php) because of fixation of a derived allele at a locus other than MC1R. In contrast, East Asians are “ancestral” at the locus where Europeans are “derived,” but they show evidence of strong positive selection for the Arg67Gln haplotype on MC1R. Here are Arg67Gln frequencies by population ([source](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v66n4/991391/991391.tb1.html)):

Inuit 92.5%  
Japan 76.7%  
\*\*\*Finland 30.0%\*\*\*  
Papua New Guinea 12.5%  
Saami 11.5%  
Sweden 7.7%  
Ireland 6.5%  
UK Asian Indians 4.5%  
England 3.1%  
Italy 2.9%  
Southern India 2.3%  
Ivory Coast 0.0%  
The Gambia 0.0%  
UK Africans 0.0%  
Sardinia 0.0%

Along with data from [TAT C](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pubmed) it makes you wonder. They used to say you scratch a Russian and you find a Tatar, well, [if you scratch a Finn](http://www.alwaysdream.org/specialevents/passage2paradise2003/images/11.jpg)….
