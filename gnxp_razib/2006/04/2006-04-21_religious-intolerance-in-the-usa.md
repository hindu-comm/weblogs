Religious intolerance in the USA

How deep do the seams of tolerance run in this country? Sometimes you wonder…ultimately, I’m pessimistic about the human love of liberty. I tend to agree with Matt McIntosh that to some extent American defense of individual freedoms is based on custom & tradition rather than reasoned acceptance of core principles. In any case I had a book on my shelf which I just had some spare time to open today, [America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691119767/geneexpressio-20/), and I saw this table:

|                                                                    |                        |                           |                           |                     | |--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------| |                                                                   | Spiritual Shoppers (%) | Christian Inclusivists(%) | Christian Exclusivists(%) | All Respondents (%) | | Percentage who said they favored:                                  |                        |                           |                           |                     | | Making it illegal for Muslim groups to meet in the United States   | 15                     | 27                        | 27                        | 23                  | | Making it illegal for Hindu groups to meet in the United States    | 12                     | 25                        | 24                        | 20                  | | Making it illegal for Buddhist groups to meet in the United States | 12                     | 24                        | 23                        | 20                  | | *N*                                                                | \(897\)                | \(677\)                   | (1,006)                   | (2,910)             |

Of course, the standard caveat applies that many respondents are probably too dumb to understand the questions.
