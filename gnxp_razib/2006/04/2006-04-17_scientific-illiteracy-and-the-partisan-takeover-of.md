Scientific Illiteracy and the Partisan Takeover of Biology

Liza Gross has an essay in PLoS Biology, [“Scientific Illiteracy and the Partisan Takeover of Biology”](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040167), about Jon D. Miller’s work on scientific literacy.

The good news:  
Only 17% of adults in the U.S. are “scientifically literate,” but that’s higher than in Canada, Japan, and Europe.

The bad news:

> in a 2005 survey measuring the proportion of adults who accept > evolution in 34 European countries and Japan, the United States ranked > 33rd, just above Turkey. No other country has so many people who are > absolutely committed to rejecting the concept of evolution, Miller > says. “We are truly out on a limb by ourselves.”

Interesting conclusions:

> Miller sees opportunities for learning everywhere and may be one of > the few people in the scientific community to see an upside to Big > Pharma’s ubiquitous direct-to-consumer TV drug ads. **By saying that > cholesterol levels derive from two sources-diet and family > history-commercials for Lipitor and other cholesterol-reducing statins > introduce the notion that genetics is probabilistic rather than > deterministic in a very basic way that people can understand**, he > explains. “But if you say that genetic predisposition is > ‘probabilistic,’ you’ve just lost 90% of the people.” >
> The limiting step in enhancing scientific literacy is not people’s > capacity for learning, Miller says, as much as it is interest. When > Americans are diagnosed with cancer or some other life-threatening > disease, “the vast number of these people go online and learn more > science in the next 12 months than a typical undergraduate will ever > learn. It is impressive how much people can learn with the proper > motivation. We need to get people to be savvy about how to find the > information and make sense of it.” >
> Miller urges scientists to take comfort in the fact that the majority > of Americans are not anti-science, but simply don’t know how exciting > scientific discovery can be. “We must be cautious and not presume that > our society feels strongly about what scientists do one way or > another. There’s a lot of work to be done for us to tell people what > we do, why we do it, and why it’s important,” he advises. Given the > pace of biomedical discoveries in the 21st century, he adds, it’s > likely that more and more scientific issues will reach the public > agenda. “We’re going to be revisiting various versions of these > questions again and again. But there’s a large segment of Americans > who still haven’t made up their mind on these issues. We in the > scientific community have to treat them seriously, talk to them, and > make our arguments. This is a great opportunity for us.”
