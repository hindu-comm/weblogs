Jugs & Jargon

A [comment on another weblog](http://snippy.livejournal.com/263651.html):

> This blog is often over my head, full of jargon I don’t know, > references I don’t get, and an academic style of writing that is > impenetrable to my non-college-educated (yet) perception. But when > they do get through to me, it’s invaribly interesting.

On the first point, well, not really. On the second point, what jargon is confusing??? I’ll be away from the computer this weekend, but I’m curious as to what comments about confusing jargon are offered in the discussion thread….
