Hawks on Noise

John Hawks added his [two cents about noise](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/expression/gene_expression_noise_2006.html) including an interesting discussion on the [source of circadian rhythms](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/expression/lemos_circadian_expression_2006.html). Note that the real author of the noise post was not me (Coffee Mug), but a friend of mine who goes by deadsmith, when he goes by internet names..
