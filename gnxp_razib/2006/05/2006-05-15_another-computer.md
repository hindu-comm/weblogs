Another computer ?

So, [my computer is having issues again](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/05/question-for-hardware-geeks.php). It was working fine for 4 days without a battery, but then all of a sudden it shut down, and now when I try to boot it up again it blinks the red battery light in the front as if it needs a battery. Put the battery back in, and it mysteriously has 26% power, and I managed to get into the computer by ignoring the “incompatible AC adapter” warning by hitting F1. In any case, I am thinking of just getting a new battery to get this computer to work as a stop gap until I get a new one (I’ve got a back up lap top, which is small and old, but usable). Any idea what’s going on?
