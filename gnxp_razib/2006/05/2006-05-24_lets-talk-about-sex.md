Let‚Äôs talk about sex‚Ä¶.

PLOS [has a new paper](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040187) out which fleshes out how [SRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRY) might play a critical role in sex determination in mammals. Here is the [press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/dumc-gto052306.php). Below the fold I‚Äôve taken [figure 7](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=slideshow&type=figure&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040187&id=53084) from their paper and cropped and reedited it a bit for ease of viewing, as well as adding minor parenthetical remarks (e.g., I assume most readers know the common symbol for repression in molecular genetic models, but some might not). Molecular genetics really isn‚Äôt my thing, but it is good to know if we are interested in the **phenotypic** impact of a particular locus (e.g., SRY) the particular genotypic dynamics that underlay it.¬π Also, I‚Äôve reviewd the sex determination literature in mammals recently (which was smaller than I‚Äôd expected), and it did surprise me that females were not just the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù pathways as I‚Äôd expected, there is active suppression of the development of the [Mullerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullerian_duct) in male embryos.  
1 ‚Äì The reason it isn‚Äôt my thing is that *some* molecular genetics people seem to only give a perfunctory nod to evolutionary thought in their fixation on specific processes. That‚Äôs fine, but it seems tome that Theodosius Dobzhanksy‚Äôs assertion that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution could be modified to biology is more fun if you add an evolutionary angle to your thinking. See [Genes in Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674017137/geneexpressio-20/102-8227911-5927302). I mean that‚Äôs what science is supposed to be about, right? Having fun on the NSF and NIH‚Äôs dime üôÇ
