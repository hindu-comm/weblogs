One “deafness” allele = better healing?

[Weird finding](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/esoh-mid050406.php):

I guess they are [positing heterozygote advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage). The only thing is one assumes that selection for heterozygosity would be a) strong b) recent, because being deaf is really maladaptive, and modifier genes would have evolved to mask that trait given enough time. If this is a standard Mendelian trait, than the frequency of the homozygotes (deaf) in the population would be q², where p = wild type, and q = mutant. If a pq combination is more fit than either pp or qq, its increase in frequency would be buffered by the fact that as q increases (ergo, the % who are pq increases) the number who are qq also increases. In a situation where you want to maximize pq, the heterozygote, and the homozygotes have equal fitness, you’d have p = .5 and q=.5, so that the frequency of the heterozygotes would be 2pq, or 50%. But, you’d have 25% who are qq, which is *not good*, since we know they are maladptive….  
Anyway, [JP](https://contingencytable.blogspot.com/) is at the conference where this was presented, so perhaps he’ll have more details soon.  
**Update:** For overdominance/heterozygote advantage….

  
pq (heterozygote) = 1  
pp (homozygote = 1 – s₁  
qq (homozygote) = 1- s₂  
Where s = selection coefficient  
Equilibrium frequency of p is = s₂ / ( s₁ + s₂)  
Assume that pp (wild type) has a fitness of 0.95 (ergo, s₁ = -0.05) and qq (deafness) has a fitness of 0.5 (ergo, s₂ = -0.5). You get a frequency of p as 91%, so that heterozygotes are 16.5% of the population.  
So, this paper is of interest, [High carrier frequency of the 35delG deafness mutation in European populations. Genetic Analysis Consortium of GJB2 35delG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10713883&query_hl=5&itool=pubmed_docsum):

I doubt it is at equilibrium….
