Roaring out of Africa

This [lion research](http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/(4ojx5t55ucmlzo45veo2xb55)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,11,84;journal,1,223;linkingpublicationresults,1:102024,1) is just cool. Hey, I’m human, I’m a sucker for cats, and the bigger the better:

> Understanding the phylogeographic processes affecting endangered > species is crucial both to interpreting their evolutionary history and > to the establishment of conservation strategies. Lions provide a key > opportunity to explore such processes; however, a lack of genetic > diversity and shortage of suitable samples has until now hindered such > investigation. We used mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) > sequences to investigate the phylogeographic history of modern lions, > using samples from across their entire range. We find the sub-Saharan > African lions are basal among modern lions, supporting a single > African origin model of modern lion evolution, equivalent to the > ‘recent African origin’ model of modern human evolution. We also find > the greatest variety of mtDNA haplotypes in the centre of Africa, > which may be due to the distribution of physical barriers and > continental-scale habitat changes caused by Pleistocene glacial > oscillations. Our results suggest that the modern lion may currently > consist of three geographic populations on the basis of their recent > evolutionary history: North African-Asian, southern African and middle > African. Future conservation strategies should take these evolutionary > subdivisions into consideration.

I’ve put two images of interest from the article below the fold.
