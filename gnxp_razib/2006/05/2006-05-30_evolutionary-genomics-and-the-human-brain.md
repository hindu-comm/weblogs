Evolutionary genomics and the human brain

*PLOS Genetics* has a [nice review](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020080) titled [The Jewels of Our Genome: The Search for the Genomic Changes Underlying the Evolutionarily Unique Capacities of the Human Brain](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020080). It is short and pithy and hits the major points (e.g., SNPs vs. duplications vs. gene expression), so I see no reason to offer any commentary or review of an an already satisfactory commentary and review. If you want original research articles in this area, [go here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=16631324). Some of the material is even open access now.  
**Update:** John Hawks [has more](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/2006/05/30#sikela_2006_genomics_cognition_brain).
