Making Sense of Heritability

[Neven Sesardic](http://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/) is a philosopher of science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. In an earlier thread I recommended his new book [Making Sense of Heritability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052182818X/sr=8-1/qid=1147763523/ref=sr_1_1/002-4555416-1182417?%5Fencoding=UTF8). From the dusk jacket:

> In this book, Neven Sesardic defends the view that it is both possible > and useful to measure the separate contributions of heredity and > environment to the explanation of human psychological differences. He > critically examines the view – very widely accepted by scientists, > social scientists and philosophers of science – that heritability > estimates have no causal implications and are devoid of any interest. > In a series of clearly written chapters he introduces the reader to > the problems and subjects the arguments to close philosophical > scrutiny. His conclusion is that anti-heritability arguments are based > on conceptual confusions and misunderstandings of behavioural > genetics. His book is a fresh, original and compelling intervention in > a very contentious debate.

There is actually nothing new here of substantive scientific interest to devoted GNXPers. Read it instead for the pleasure of watching the numbing anti-hereditarian catechism of “heritability-estimates-are-meaningless” skillfully and methodically dismantled by a sharp and incisive mind.

This is an expensive academic book. You can find free copies of Sesardic’s journal papers on these matters [here](http://www.ln.edu.hk/philoso/staff/sesardic/publications.html).
