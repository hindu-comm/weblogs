Reading the Dumb Vinci Code

Conservative Christian Pollster George Barna has an [interesting report out](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=238) on those who have read the book, *The Da Vinci Code*. Some results:

  
\* Catholics more likely to have read it than Protestants  
\* “Upscale” individuals are four times as likely to have read it than “downscale” ones (household income greater than \$60 K & college degree vs. vs. less than \$30 K & no college degree)  
\* The novel shifted the religious thinking of Hispanics, liberals, women (vs. men) and the upscale to a greater extent than other groups  
I haven’t read the book and to a great extent have checked out of “pop culture,” so I don’t get the fuss. But, a friend who was a graduate student at MIT while he was on the singles scene said that reading the book was essential to having conversations with many of the women he was trying to date. In any case, my objection to the movie & the book are mostly based on the fact that it is **bad history**.
