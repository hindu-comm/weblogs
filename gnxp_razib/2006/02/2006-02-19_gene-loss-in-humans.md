Gene loss in humans

[Tim](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2006/02/19/gene_losses_in_human_evolution) [posts](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2006/02/19/gene_losses_in_human_evolution) on the recent *PLOS* paper [Gene Losses during Human Origins](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040052) published by the Wang et al. If that gets you all excited, check out [The Origin of Subfunctions and Modular Gene Regulation](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/170/1/433) and [Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/151/4/1531). I might lionize the contributions of R.A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J.B.S. Haldane to evolutionary biology, but as I posted before, tools need tasks, and the mass of data being unveiled by genomics is uncovering many surprises. Science isnâ€™t about *a priori* inference, it is about venturing into the wilds, and by the grace of god we live in an Age of Discovery (the [post-genomic era](http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw43/lenggauer.html)).
