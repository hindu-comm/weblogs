January – National Have Sex With Your Teacher Month

For all of the readers who were kept in the dark about this commemorative event, [Interested Participant](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/) has dilgently collected reports about those who rang in the New Year in the spirit of celebration. From his January archive, here are the highlights (see if you notice a pattern emerging):

[28-year-old](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113872618654968729) teacher Traci J. Tapp was arrested on charges of official misconduct and sexual crimes involving three male students. Tapp pleaded guilty yesterday to harassment by offensive touching in accordance with a plea agreement and was fined \$100. The prosecutors asked for a probationary period but Judge James Isman declined. Tapp actually comments at *Interested Participant’s* blog and this looks like she was falsely accused.

[Substitute teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113866102225092302) Jacquelyn Faith Garrison, 19, allegedly made significant overtures, some sexual, through telephone calls and text messages toward a 15-year-old student, making him uncomfortable.

[A 41-year-old English teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113856902702317195) at Scott Memorial Middle School, Karen Susan Patton, was arrested for allegedly engaging in sex with a 13-year-old student.

[A 40-year-old teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113849420980257519) at Rothwell-Osnabruck Public School in Ingleside, Jennifer Dorland, was charged Wednesday with sexual assault of a 13-year-old male student. Police confirmed that the sexual incidents occurred at the school.

[Earlier this month](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113839131345474244), 25-year-old Jessica Bowring pleaded guilty to one count of gross sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy. Yesterday, Bowring was sentenced in Somerset County Superior Court to five years in prison, with all but 9 months suspended. She’ll also serve three years probation and have to register as a lifetime sex offender.

[With the prevalence of teacher-student sex episodes](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113838126119622005) in American schools, one would imagine that the last thing needed is a “Win A Date With Teacher” contest. Strangely, that’s exactly what was offered by 36-year-old Strongsville High School teacher Christine Scarlett and the winner, 17-year-old Steven Bradigan, won not only the date but also regular sharpenings of his pencil.

[Last August, a 27-year-old teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113834843257159775) at Ecole Pere Edgar T. LeBlanc, Renee Florence Gaudet, was charged with sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a 13-year-old male student. In November, Gaudet pleaded guilty to sexual assault. Yesterday, Gaudet was sentenced to two years house arrest and told to go to a mental health clinic for assessment and necessary treatment.

[A 46-year-old special education teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113829437569130524) at Ferguson Middle School, Cathy Heminghaus, has been charged with nineteen (19) felony counts of statutory sodomy resulting from allegedly engaging in oral sex with some of her students. Heminghaus apparently told her friends that she had performed oral sex on students since October. Her friends told school officials. The incidents occurred at the school and at one outside location.

[Former English teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113809817675975870) at South Central High School, Katherine B. Tew, 31, was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a student and given a prison term of six to eight months, suspended, and two years probation. After her sex-toy student boyfriend, 17, spilled the beans last February, an investigation was launched which resulted in finding that Tew, known as “Katy” Tew, was engaging in an extended-term, passing-love-notes relationship with the boy. The nature of their relationship explained behavior that included late-night prancing in pajamas while pulling plugs from a bottle of tequila. Tew was arrested and released on \$10,000 bail. Tew denied the charges, however, she was unable to explain why her cell phone records indicated that she had talked to the boy 129 times in a two-month period when she had only talked to her husband 67 times during the same period.

[A 29-year-old substitute teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113801538239342979) at Tooele High School, Cameo Patch, was arrested Friday and booked on suspicion of unlawful sexual conduct, a third-degree felony, and lewdness, a class A misdemeanor. It’s alleged that Patch met with a 16- or 17-year-old student one evening and had sex. Subsequently, the boy talked about it at school and, after a resource officer learned of the incident, police were alerted.

[A 33-year-old married teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113800012758190829) at Warren Alternative School, Amy Bramhall, was arrested last Wednesday and charged with sexual abuse of a minor for allegedly engaging in sexual relations with a 15-year-old student. According to court documents, teacher and student would party together with Bramhall bringing the booze and the boy providing marijuana. On one occasion, Bramhall’s cuckolded husband caught the pair doing the horizontal mambo in the couple’s home.

[A former Fresno County](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113792508722325356) probation officer has surrendered to police on charges of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old ward whom she met while working at Elkhorn boot camp.

[36-year-old teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113778668151335660) and coach at Lecanto High School, Amy Gail Lilley, was arrested last November for engaging in a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old female student. Subsequently, Lilley resigned her teaching position.

[30-year-old female English teacher](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113777973266081660) at Central York High School, Robin Winkis, resigned her position as an employee of the school district, effective December 21. The school board voted to accept her resignation on Monday.

[Despite the prosecution’s recommendation](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113766612231160711) and the desires of the victim’s parents, Judge Suzanne V. Delvecchio ruled that former teacher and child rapist, 26-year-old Gregory Pathiakis, hadn’t been naughty enough to warrant any jail time.

[A 33-year-old youth counselor](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113750147925008039), Naomi Morton, was arraigned Friday before Judge Richard Rambo in Klamath Count  
y Circuit Court for alleged sexual abuse of a 17-year-old boy.

[A 38-year-old unidentified woman](https://interested-participant.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_interested-participant_archive.html#113749899987351861) was arrested last Wednesday for allegedly raping and sodomizing a 15-year-old high school student from Ragland.
