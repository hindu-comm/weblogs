Ear wax table

I’ve been getting queries about the ear wax paper…below the fold I’ve copied [table 1](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ng1733_T1.html), which shows the frequencies of the haplotypes in various populations.

- First, note the sample sizes. - Keep these sample sizes in mind as you try to get an understanding of
  the clines the authors were talking about. - Greg Cochran points out that since dry ear wax is a recessive trait it
  seems plausible that the phenotype being selected is different. It
  might be dominant or additive so that a total approach toward fixation
  of the allele would not be necessary for the fitness to be maximized.
  Consider the earwax trait, if allele frequences are 0.5 for both A and
  G in a population, you have 0.25 = AA, 0.5 = AG and 0.25 = GG. So Only
  1/4 benefit from the fitness increasing trait. If it is a dominant
  feature somewhere else, you flip it, and with a 0.5 A frequency 3/4 of
  the population would maximize their fitness. - On the bit about randon genetic drift vs. selection, [look at the
  map](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ng1733_F4.html),
  if this allele was approaching fixation via stochastic processes it
  seems peculiar that it would exhibit a continental cline. Fragmented
  populations can fix at alternative alleles, but the distribution would
  be patchy and intercalated, not suggestive of a broad trend around an
  East Asian mode.
