J.B.S. Haldane and Soviet Zombie Dogs

WFMU blog [points me](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2006/02/a_brief_history.html) to the infamous *Experiments in the Revival of Organisms* (1940) propaganda video at the always fascinating [Prelinger archive](http://www.archive.org/details/Experime1940), featuring Soviet stooge/scientific genius J.B.S. Haldane as narrator to Stalinist Russia Frankenstein experiments in reanimation. Gasp as a life-supported severed dog’s head licks its chops and dodges various irritants. Marvel as other lucky dogs are drained of all their blood and brought back to life 10 minutes later. And don’t feel bad if you’re a little more skeptical than Haldane, after all he pimped Lysenko too!

Anyway [here](http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/2006/01/soviet_dog_experiment.mp4) is a direct link to the film. Should take about a minute or two to load. WFMU also has an [entertaining](http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2006/02/a_brief_history.html) little history of disembodied heads, including Robert White’s [monkey head switching shenanigans](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1263758.stm).
