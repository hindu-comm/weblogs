Book review in Science and Spirit

I have a review of Nick Wade’s [Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200793/geneexpressio-20/) coming out in the May/June issue of [Science & Spirit](http://www.science-spirit.org/) magazine. Wade’s book covered the intersection of genetics and human evolution, so it was a quick and interesting read.
