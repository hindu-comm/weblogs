Multiculturalism

**Update:** [Link](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/multiculturalism.php) fixed.  
I have a [long post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/multiculturalism.php) on my other website commenting on Amartya Sen’s [new piece](http://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20060227&s=sen022706) in *The New Republic*, [Chili and Liberty](http://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20060227&s=sen022706). First paragraph below:

> Amartya Sen has an interesting piece in *The New Republic* titled > Chili and liberty: the uses and abuses of multiculturalism. Sen’s > piece addresses the paradox in the interpretation of > “multiculturalism” in some quarters where it implies separation of > distinct cultures into a “plural monoculturalism.” That is, a nation > where separate ethnic and religious groups live apart within the same > polity. A pre-modern form of this system would be the millets of the > Ottoman Empire, where religious leaders would be responsible for and > command their own particular community. A contrasting dynamic is the > admixture of various particular traditions and forms into a new > cultural complex, in Sen’s case he points to the emergence of curry > powder, a British colonial invention that has become synonomous with > South Asian culture and now is a common part of the British culinary > scene. Going back to the Ottoman example, the fez which Kemal Attaturk > famously banned as an example of retrograde practice was originally > introduced only one century prior and had little sectarian > implication.
