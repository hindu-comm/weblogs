Derb, not posted

I noticed that John Derbyshire’s latest column was [not posted](http://olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/HesperophobiaContinued.htm) at *NRO*. But, you can find it [at his website](http://olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/HesperophobiaContinued.htm). Also, here are his other two web pieces not posted, [You can’t talk about that](http://olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/YouCantTalkAboutThat.htm) and the innocuously titled [March Diary](http://olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/Diary%202005-03.htm).
