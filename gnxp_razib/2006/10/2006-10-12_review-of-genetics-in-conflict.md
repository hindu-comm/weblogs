[The Dark Side of DNA](http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/54050) is a review of [Genes in Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674017137/geneexpressio-20/), Austin Burt and Robert Triver’s magisterial survey of the extant literature of ‘selfish genetic elements.’ Do you know what the killer ‘[t-haplotype](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1207879)‘ is? You should, it is pretty bizarre.
