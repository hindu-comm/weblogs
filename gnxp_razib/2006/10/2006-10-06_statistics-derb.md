Statistics & Derb

[Chris of Mixing Memory](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/) points me to two new statistics weblogs, [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/mlm/) and [Science Science Statistics Blog](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/). Also, Chris tells me he will soon post a review of some papers on visual perception of race, so check his blog in a few days. Meanwhile, Derb has a [new article](http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=4210&sec_id=4210) in [The New English review](http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=4210&sec_id=4210). He is in classic Derb form, as he states:

Ten percent is alarming. Frankly, one percent is alarming. My own personal estimation is considerably lower, but what do I know? But, I do have a suspicion that if expectation of the probability of a nuclear attack on a U.S. city within the next 10 years is *x*, the likelihood that such an attack will occur in the Middle East is considerably higher, perhaps an order of magnitude greater than *x*.
