Thoughts from Kansas on The God Delusion

Josh Rosenau has a [review](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2006/10/the_god_confusion_dawkins_on_t.php) of *The God Delusion* which is, I think, a little bit harder on Richard Dawkins than I. The [comments](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2006/10/the_god_confusion_dawkins_on_t.php#comments) are hopping, so you should check it out!  
Let me reiterate my general position re: Dawkins & *The God Delusion*:

- My own personal assessment of the universe as it is resembles that of
  Dawkins - My own assessment of the nature of religious belief is similar to that
  of Dawkins, insofar as I believe it is a byproduct of proximate
  cognitive features which have their ultimate origins in our
  evolutionary history - My own attitude is one of general hostility toward religious
  fundamentalisms, particularly of the monotheistic stripe - But, I differ with Dawkins in that I tend to put more weight on the
  reality that religion is here to stay in some form, and as a matter of
  tactics am not willing to endorse a wholesale attack on religion *qua*
  religion as anything but a quixotic quest - Though I agree that religion is the necessary precondition for
  extremist religion, I see the difference between moderate and
  fundamentalist religion as less a difference of the magnitude of an
  essential religiosity as a modulation of underlying parameters which
  characterize the distribution of a religion. To use an analogy, I do
  not believe that democratic socialism is any less socialist that
  revolutionary socialism, it simply has a different attitude toward
  violence and democratic institutions as a means or barrier to social
  justice - Though I agree that individuals like Dawkins are essential in the
  marketplace of ideas, **I do not see any remote possibility that
  humans will ever exhibit a Dawkinsian attitude toward the world around
  us** - Unlike Dawkins I do not hold to the universal importance of truth for
  all humans. Unlike Christians I do not believe that all must know the
  Good News of scientific materialism, and I am not inclined toward
  giving a drowning man a life jacket - I tend to think that the good and evil in the name of religion is not
  ascribable to religion per se. I get the sentiment from Dawkins that
  he wants to decouple the good from religion, and yet still pin the
  evil on religion. I donâ€™t think this is plausible, if religion
  increases the magnitude of negative behavior it seems as if it should
  also increase the magnitude of positive behavior (unless one
  tautologically defines religion as evil behavior axiomatically)
