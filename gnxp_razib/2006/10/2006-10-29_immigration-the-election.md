Immigration & the election

Steve’s newest column [tackles](http://www.vdare.com/sailer/061029_election.htm) the next election (and the likely shift toward the Democrats) and its relevance to [immigration](http://www.vdare.com/sailer/061029_election.htm). Meanwhile, Derb has been talking up [Lou Dobbs Democrats](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGUxYTBiZTU4MzlmODIzYzI5OTBjNmU5Y2JjYjM2NjE). I don’t know what to think about this. I haven’t talked about immigration much because I’ve been rather pessimistic of late…but now I’m not sure sure. Perhaps I won’t have to make sure that I’m part of the 21st century oligarchy.
