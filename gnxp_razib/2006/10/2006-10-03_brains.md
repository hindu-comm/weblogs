Brains

Narrowing down genes that play a role in cognition, bit by bit…

1\. Way back when, in 2004, Bruce Lahn’s group published [a paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSN-4F493RP-G&_coverDate=12%2F29%2F2004&_alid=460632588&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=7051&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=12a24b425807c1579e253ec7c73f32b6) arguing that nervous system genes, particularly neurodevelopmental genes, showed accelerated evolution in primates as compared to rodents. A [new paper](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/20/3034?etoc) restricts the analysis to genes in a certain pathway– one involved in programmed cell death– and finds the same thing– accelerated evolution in primates. A number of interesting genes worth study are in the pathway.

2\. In April, a group [reported](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/04/update-on-recent-iq-research.php) on a (weak) association between intelligence and variants in a gene encoding for dysbindin-1. A [new study](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/20/3041?etoc) sheds a little light on what this protein does and where it does it. A first step towards understand if and how it plays a role in higher cognitive function.
