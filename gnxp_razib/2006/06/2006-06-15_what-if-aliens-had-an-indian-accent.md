What if aliens had an Indian accent?

Manish has a post up on this YouTube [video](http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/the-elvis-puff) of a South Indian movie where the male lead has an out of control bouffant. The weird thing is that whenever I hear South Indian languages I always get a weird feeling like I’m listening to aliens chattering in an Indian accent. Myself, I can speak Bengali with about an 8 year old level of fluency, and so Hindi (an Indo-European language like Bengali) doesn’t sound too weird and I can make out many of the words…but when I hear people going off in Tamil or something it is really strange (the languages of South India are Dravidian, not Indo-European). Imagine people speaking Japanese with a strong French accent, and you get what I’m talking about.  
**Samples:** This [shit is Bengali](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YgZ7zuztS1M&search=bengali). This is [Hindi](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4ThWU67PeWI&search=hindi%20song). And here is [Malayalam](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZCcx5fW1ljw&search=malayalam%20song) (ignore the midgets). And you thought Britney Spears was a freak show.
