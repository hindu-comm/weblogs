Darwinian conservatism

[Steve](http://www.isteve.com) pointed me to [Larry Arnhart’s blog](https://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/), [Darwinian Conservatism](https://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/). I haven’t checked out Arnhart’s recent manifesto, [Darwinian Conservatism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0907845991/geneexpressio-20/002-0772936-8483204), because I am generally not too interested in such explicit derivations of political philosophy from nature. Nevertheless, the blog has made me reconsider my decision. Arnhart has some very interesting arguments and entertaining rhetoric to offer. The American Right has made an alliance with Christian evangelicals over the past generation (Frank Meyer’s “fusionism” being the early precursor), and to a great extent they have remade conservatism in their own image, at least its public face. But, I have always found the aversion to evolution rather peculiar in a movement which in its intellectual circles appeals to society as “organic” and “evolved.” In any case, as I said, more later on this topic, but I agree with [John Derbyshire](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200505100802.asp), there is nothing fundamentally “conservative” about a group of individuals who take succor from the radical Reformation.
