Gay Muslims seeking marriages of convenience

[Manish](http://ultrabrown.com/) points me to this bizarre [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/23/AR2006062301417.html) about a successful young American who happens to be gay, and, is seeking a “marriage of convenience” with a suitably inclined lesbian. Oh, and guess what, he is a practicing Muslim to boot! A few months ago rik asked me if I thought science and religion were fundamentally compatible. My somewhat lame answer was that they must be, as there are individuals who are great scientists who seem sincerely religious. Now, is a homosexual orientation which is active and unabashed compatible with Islam? Most of the scholars and clerics interviewed in the article disavow any hint of such a possibility, and yet people ***live this ideal***. Is it possible to be a vegan for ethical reasons all the while being a promiscuous [zoophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophile)?¹ Hell if I know. The illusion of an integrated and rational mind is really getting to be a problem for me. The power of ideas is overrated, the persuasiveness of preference is neglected.  
1 – I do not believe animals can give consent, so zoophilia is rape in my eyes.
