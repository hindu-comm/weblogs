Religious people are less intelligent

At my [other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/fun-with-gss-ghosts-and-iq.php) [Jason Malloy](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/fun-with-gss-ghosts-and-iq.php) points me to [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/06/religious_peopl.html) who [crunches the data](http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/06/religious_peopl.html) from the GSS and finds that yes, religiosity is a predictor of lower intelligence. One of the most googled postings of mine from years back is where I showed that there is a [positive](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001523.html) [trend](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001527.html) for mean national IQ to predict mean national religiosity. Of course, by the numbers, most high IQ people are still religious, they are simply less religious than those of lower IQ. Anyway, here is a [follow up rant](http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/06/religion_and_in.html) from [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/2006/06/religion_and_in.html).  
Of course, another fact is that the non-religious also probably like confirmation of the fact that they are brighter!
