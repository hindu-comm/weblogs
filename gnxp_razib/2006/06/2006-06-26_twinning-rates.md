Twinning rates

[Gary Steinman](http://www.aecom.yu.edu/home/faculty/profile.asp?id=7539) is the [researcher](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/twins_blood_milk_and_society.php) who published the findings that diet may modify fraternal twinning rates. I just listened to him giving an interview on the radio, and he made the following points:

- Fraternal twinning rate seems to track basal levels of
  [IGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor) - Basal levels of IGF vary across populations, Sub-Saharan Africans have
  the highest rates, Asians the least, and twinning rates follow this
  trend - When Yoruba move from the countryside to the city their twinning rates
  drop to the European level, while Japanese American twinning rates
  converge with white American twinning rates as opposed to Japanese
  twinning rates
