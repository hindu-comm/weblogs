Nation Building

I will be contributing to the new blog [Nation Building](https://dean2004.blogspot.com/), which *was* the weblog “Dean Nation.” Though I am generally of the opinion that the 4-year-election-cycle is generally characterized by transient epiphenomena on a substantive level (though there’s a lot of tribalism and “my team won!” going around), I do think the long-term health of the republic (long term as in 20-40 years) is important. My opinions will be more philosophical and historical, but they will have some political relevance. I’ll be offering my idiosyncratic perspective as a libertarian/Burkean/transhumanist/evolutionist (not necessarily in that order!).
