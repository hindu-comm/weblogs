Electric sympatry

There has been a long standing debate in evolution of the possibility of sympatric speciation, that is, speciation between two coterminous populations. Well, here is [evidence from some fish](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June06/electric.fish.sb.html) of it happening, at least in the first stages, so that genetic differentiation is minimal to non-existent. I don’t know how common sympatry is, but I’ve been to other talks pointing to similar phenomena in other taxa, so I think there has been a detection bias toward allopatry.  
But anyway, species concepts are a bugger. The main point is that population differentiation need not always be preconditioned on geographic separation.
