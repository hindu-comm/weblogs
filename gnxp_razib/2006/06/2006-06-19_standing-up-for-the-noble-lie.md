Standing up for the noble lie

John Derbyshire, the firestarter extraordinaire of National Review is at it again. This time, it’s a pretty conventional rerun of the good ol’ genetics vs. environment parenting cagematch. What is less conventional is the candidness of the Derb’s opponent: Jonah Goldberg.

[Derbyshire states:](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTI3OTc5ODc2MTQxYjczNjQ4ZDk2YTIxOWE2NTVhZTc=)

Sorry, no sale.

Pretty conventional “truth always comes first” boilerplate. Meh. Now, Goldberg on the other hand [dares to be different:](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTQxNDM5OTk2OTI1MjYzM2IyM2EwYjIxMDIxNmM5ZTg=)

**Update from Razib:** Keep an eye on [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/), it be buzzing….

**Update from Rikurzhen:** Informative comments from the Haloscan thread for the sake of Google:

From that link, here’s the data for income and adoption:
