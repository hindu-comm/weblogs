Graham Hancock, expert in bulls*it

[EurekAlert](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-06/bri-ghi061906.php) obviously doesn’t have quality control, as of right now their top press release in the [Biology](http://www.eurekalert.org/bysubject/biology.php) category is [Graham Hancock, international expert on lost civilizations](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-06/bri-ghi061906.php). If you don’t know, [Hancock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hancock) is a [pseudoarcheologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoarchaeology). Basically he is just [Robert E. Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Howard) with a little more world-creation talent and more literary panache. Hancock reminds us of an important point: **quackish beliefs are not the monopoly of religous fundamentalists**. In fact, I would argue that religious fundamentalism, for whatever reason, reinforces quackish beliefs, but those beliefs are somewhat innate in most human beings (ergo, Creationist appeals to “common sense”).
