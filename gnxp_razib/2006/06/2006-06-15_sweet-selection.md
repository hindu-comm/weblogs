Sweet selection!!!

On the heels of the [asinine review](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/before-dawn-slammed-in-nature.php) of [Before the Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200793/geneexpressio-20/102-9529791-1661752) in *Nature*, I see [Carl](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/06/15/human_as_natural_selections_gu.php) is linking to some recent papers that are coming out in regards to positive selection in our own storied lineage. I must say that the [new one](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5780/1614) in *Science* is quite phat in its broad sweep. Pictures below the fold….

Show me the money honey, you can sneer about incomplete evidence for selection on human lactase persistence, but saying it just ain’t gonna make it so.
