I care about social justice!

I was hungry yesterday, and everywhere I went the lines were long, so I decided to visit a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù restaurant. While I was waiting for my order a 7 year old child was adding more ice to the soda fountain machine. The child had to use a chair to climb up, and he was having a very difficult time with the task. I assumed this was the owner‚Äôs child helping out, but he was wearing a fanchise uniform. I couldn‚Äôt help it, I was outraged, so I blurted out ‚ÄúThey let you work here?!‚Äù I mean, I was thinking, *what is this, Pakistan?* The child looked at me, and was like, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù And suddenly I realized that it wasn‚Äôt a young preadolescent male, **it was a *very short woman* with a haircut that could only be termed ‚Äòboyish.‚Äô** Secondary sexual characteristics were not in evidence, so I would not be surprised if this was a Turner‚Äôs Syndrome individual or someone with a hormonal pathology. Anyway, I was pretty embarrassed, but I saved myself, I was like, ‚ÄúOh, I thought you were someone else.‚Äù But at least I found out that my egoistic self is moved by the possibility of child labor in fast food joints to express reflexive protest!  
With that said, a few good causes‚Ä¶let‚Äôs do it people! (if you‚Äôve donated somewhere, sometime, good for you, and ignore my nagging)

Of course I don‚Äôt want to be a pest about this, but I‚Äôm not forcing you to read the blog üôÇ
