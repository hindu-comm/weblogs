More papers

Too many to describe each of them:

[“Genome-wide genetic association of complex traits in heterogeneous stock mice”](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng1840) Nature Genetics 38, 879 – 887 (2006) — [News and Views](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n8/abs/ng0806-861.html) — Interesting technique to handle correlation structure in the QTLs. They were able to account for \~75% of the additive variance while most QTLs found were in the 1-5% range.

[“Dissecting the complex genetic basis of mate choice”](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n9/abs/nrg1924.html) in model organisms — Nature Reviews Genetics

> - Genes expressed in the testes have experienced positive selection >   both with respect to their expression and to their sequences among >   primates. > - Gene expression in the brain has diverged less than that of other >   tissues analysed to date, but a tendency for acceleration of changes >   on the human lineage relative to the chimpanzee lineage could >   indicate positive selection.

[Molecular analysis of flies selected for aggressive behavior.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng1864) — Nature Genetics – “Selective breeding was used to create a population of fighting fruitflies”[\*](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n9/full/nrg1959.html#Behavioural-genetics)
