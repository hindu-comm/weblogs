I’m an “upbeat”?

I noticed some blogs were talking about a new [Pew Political Typology](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=949#upbeats), and I decided to take their survey to see where I fit in. It said I was an [Upbeat](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=949#upbeats), which seemed wrong to me as I’m not that partisan (I voted for Kerry though my registration is Republican). So I took the [Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) test, and I got my usual result:  
Economic Left/Right: 2.13 (I’m fiscally conservative)  
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -3.38 (I’m socially liberal)  
I’m a [moderate libertarian](http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=2.13&soc=-3.38) who leans toward the slightly more liberal side. My political intensity has been decreasing over the years, and I’ve probably gotten a bit more liberal, so the non-trivially partisan “Upbeat” result took me by surprise. Anyone else have a weird result from the Pew Survey? The questions seemed a bit too black & white for me. Not a big deal, but people talk about it as if the categories are meaningful.
