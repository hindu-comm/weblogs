Voltron & evo psych

![voltron.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/08/voltron.jpg?resize=347%2C370)![voltron.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/08/voltron.jpg?resize=347%2C370)As a child it seemed that everyone preferred [Lion Voltron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron#Lion_Voltron_.28Voltron_of_the_Far_Universe.29) to [Car Voltron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron#Vehicle_Voltron_.28Voltron_of_the_Near_Universe.29). I was a contrarian and asserted that I preferred Car Voltron, and yet in my heart of hearts I knew Lion Voltron was the true bomb. Is there an evolutionary psychological reason why Lion Voltron would be more popular than Car Voltron? I mean, there are lions on national flags, but cars? Lions play a role in mythology, and C.S. Lewis even selected a lion as a Christ analogue. Could it be cognitively lions give us more “free information” and inferential power? Could it be that Lion Voltron simply fit into a more relatable mental slot than Car Voltron? After all, Lion Voltron was set on a quasi-medieval planet. Quasi in that there was a monarch, witch and a castle, but they also had lasers and space ships. In contrast, Car Voltron (vehicle Voltron) was “lost in space,” and so the whole creation of a humanoid mega-bot seemed a little canned.  
**Addendum:** Typing [Voltron](https://images.google.com/images?q=voltron&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images) into google images just brings back Lion Voltron. You have to type Vehicle Voltron to find any of the other morph, and even then the iamges aren’t very good. Just goes to show, Lion Voltron does roar, even today.
