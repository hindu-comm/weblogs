Gene therapy starting to get useful?

Some [encouraging gene therapy news in Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1129003v1):

> Cancer Regression in Patients After Transfer of Genetically Engineered > Lymphocytes >
> Using a retrovirus encoding a T cell receptor, we report here the > ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous > lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Adoptive transfer of these > transduced cells in fifteen patients resulted in durable engraftment > at levels exceeding ten percent of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at > least two months post infusion. We observed high sustained levels of > circulating, engineered cells at one year post-infusion in two > patients, that both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic > melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of > genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer.

According to reports in Swedish media (i.e. [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=597&a=569420&previousRenderType=6)) two late-stage terminal patients out of 17 trial subjects were cancer free after 18 months.
