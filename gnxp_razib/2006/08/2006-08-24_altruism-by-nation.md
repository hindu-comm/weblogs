“Altruism” (by nation)

Some of you know that I have been in a discussion with [Right Reason](http://rightreason.ektopos.com/) about the relationship between Christianity and altruism. I will address in full this weekend when I have time many of Steve’s arguments. Suffice it to say that I think he places more emphasis on the emergence and crystallization of ideas in texts than I do. But, I noted this [this post](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/believe-it-or-not-among-wealthy.html) over at [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/believe-it-or-not-among-wealthy.html) which reports data from the *World Values Survey*:

  
**Percent saying serving others is very important to them:**  
*Top 10:*  
Puerto Rico 78.8  
Morocco 67.8  
Venezuela 67.7  
Jordan 67.0  
Mexico 63.6  
Iran 62.1  
Nigeria 62.0  
Egypt 61.8  
Tanzania 58.6  
Philippines 57.5  
*Bottom 10:*  
Kyrgyzstan 25.4  
Albania 19.9  
Bosnia and Herzegovina 17.6  
Vietnam 16.2  
Singapore 15.9  
China 15.6  
Macedonia 14.5  
Montenegro 13.3  
Korea 10.8  
Japan 8.6  
Be careful at taking survey data at face value of course, but interesting nonetheless. [Full list](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/believe-it-or-not-among-wealthy.html) at [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/believe-it-or-not-among-wealthy.html).
