Archaic-modern hybridization

Over at my other weblog there is a [post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/reconstructing-human-origins-in.php) titled [Reconstructing human origins in the genomic era](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/reconstructing-human-origins-in.php), a commentary on a [review paper](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n9/abs/nrg1941.html) in *Nature*. Here are the two bullet points I want to highlight:

- **These genome-scale patterns could be best accounted for by models
  that involve **low levels of gene flow among archaic populations**
  before the emergence of anatomically modern humans – that is, they
  imply the existence of ancestral population structure.** - **There is also growing evidence that some highly divergent genetic
  lineages might have entered our genome through **hybridization**
  between an expanding anatomically modern human population and archaic
  forms of humans.**

Over the past year I’ve been talking up hybridization. Some people have expressed exasperated skepticism. After all, the consensus is Out of Africa, total replacement, right? Well, I have posted links to papers which suggest introgression before, but I want people to remember that Richard Dawkins pointed to a introgression/admixture model with a dominant African element in *The Ancestor’s Tale* last year. Dawkins might not be a pioneering scientist in his own right, but he is someone with “sources,” and it is important to see where he leans to get a sense of the direction of evolutionary science. This review paper/commentary in *Nature* is contingent upon the fact that I’m sure that these two individuals have access to prepress papers and research gleanings that will be more prominent within the next 6 months (keep reading Nick Wade in *The New York Times*).
