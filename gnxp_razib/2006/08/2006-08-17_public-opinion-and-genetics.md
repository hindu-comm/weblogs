Public opinion and genetics

There are many polls about the public’s attitude toward evolution, well, check [this](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115583529775438489-OPQNUEN4ZpFR4akyCLr9Vj8kXqY_20060916.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top) in *The Wall Street Journal*, [Most Americans Strongly Support Using Genetic Data for Some Uses](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115583529775438489-OPQNUEN4ZpFR4akyCLr9Vj8kXqY_20060916.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top). Take home message: genetics = good to identify criminals & fathers, genetics = bad if used by insurance companies and employers. Also, the public thinks that “science of genetics and DNA is” a very good thing. Of course, they don’t really know what the science is, just some applied spin & reality promoted by various companies.
