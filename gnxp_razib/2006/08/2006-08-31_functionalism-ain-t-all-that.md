Functionalism ain't all that

Over at [my other blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/inbreeding_among_mormons.php) I have a [post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/inbreeding_among_mormons.php) up about inbreeding fundamentalist Mormons. When brown Muslims are hittin’ it with near relations that warrants eyes averted, but if I point to slack-jawed Anglos, well, that is [BoingBoing worthy](https://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/31/inbred_fundamentalis.html). But in any case, my post focused on an [older article](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2005-12-29/news/feature_full.html) about the prevelance of fumerase deficiency among many children within the fundamentalist Mormon community of Colorado city. But one thing struck me about the article, the top-down pro-natalist and conformist nature of the community seemed to be a perfect example of the [functionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism) notions of evolutionary biologists like David Sloan Wilson. He promoted the reemergence of functionalism and evolutionary analogies in sociology and anthropology in [Darwin’s Cathedral](https://www.amazon.com/gp/explorer/0226901351/2/ref=pd_lpo_ase/102-3605398-8339304?ie=UTF8), the hyper-fecund & genetically inbred fundamentalist Mormons are an ideal case of a group level super-organism, but just like a putative lineage of human clones who reproduce parthenogenetically they are clearly doomed. I suspect that functionalism isn’t totally bunk, but like socialism it looks better on paper than it is in practice, really successful long term societies are more decentralized, flexible and fluid.
