On other blogs….

As usual, lots of activity on [my other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/). I [post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/intogression1.php) on [introgression](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/07/introgression_whats_in_a_word_1.php) [multiple](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/07/introgression_related_papers.php) [times](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/07/introgression_in_wolves_dogs.php). Also, [baby](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/random_genetic_drift_yo.php) [formalisms](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/how_long_until_fixation.php) that **all** GNXP commenters should be familiar with. Also, I am posting at [Nation Building](http://www.nationbuilding.org/) more often now (my main current political sentiment is that the Left is deluded at home and the Right is deluded abroad).

On non-GNXP related blogs, I point you to [Nature’s Numbers](https://naturesnumbers.blogspot.com/), a new blog by a maths student shifting toward bioinformatics. And over at [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/) I’ve been reading [Good Math, Bad Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/) a lot. Finally, [Darwin Catholic](https://darwincatholic.blogspot.com/2006/08/genetic-outlaw.html) posts on the [new eugenics](https://darwincatholic.blogspot.com/2006/08/genetic-outlaw.html), from a different angle then you would find at GNXP. Though I disagree on many issues with DC, I do think it is important to engage his perspective because a) a large number of fellow citizens hold such views explicitly or implicitly b) engaging an alternative position is often healthy in terms of smoking out one’s own fundamental priors & priorities.
