Income & children

Interesting paper I found [Sex, status, and reproductive success in the contemporary United States](http://www.socanth.uncc.edu/rlhopcro/EHBfinalsexandreproductivesuccess.pdf#search=%22Sex%2C%20status%2C%20and%20reproductive%20success%20in%20the%20contemporary%20United%20States%20%22) (PDF). Since you can read the whole paper, I won’t summarize it for you, but below the fold is a graph that some might find of interest.
