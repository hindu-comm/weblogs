Women in science again

[Broad National Effort Urgently Needed To Maximize Potential of Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11741)

> Studies have not found any significant biological differences between > men and women in performing science and mathematics that can account > for the lower representation of women in academic faculty and > leadership positions in S&T fields.

Authors: 17 women (e.g. Elizabeth Spelke), 1 man

[Their explanation:](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/science/19women.html)

> a pattern of unconscious but pervasive bias, “arbitrary and > subjective” evaluation processes and a work environment in which > “anyone lacking the work and family support traditionally provided by > a ‘wife’ is at a serious disadvantage.”

That must explain why bachelor scientists are less productive than their married counterparts, no? [Oh, wait…](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/05/ol-ball-and-chain.php)

Bias must also explain why [the same systematic differences in male : female ratios by discipline is found in Asian : White comparisons](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.016):

> The ratio of Asian to White in 45 academic disciplines correlated .09 > with mean Verbal GRE of discipline, .79 with Quantitative GRE, .58 > with Analytical GRE, .62 with Verbal + Quantitative + Analytical GRE, > and .75 with Quantitative âˆ’ Verbal GRE. The respective correlations > of ratio of males to females in discipline were .12, .83, .61, .66, > and .77. The rho between the two sets of correlations is 1.00 (p \< > .01.) The rank order Asian/White and male/female correlation with GRE > mean were also similar, and the rho between these sets of correlations > is .90 (p \< .05). This correlation is congruent with the contention > of Lynn (1987) that the structure of Mongoloid intelligence is to the > structure of Caucasoid intelligence as the structure of male > intelligence is to the structure of female intelligence.
