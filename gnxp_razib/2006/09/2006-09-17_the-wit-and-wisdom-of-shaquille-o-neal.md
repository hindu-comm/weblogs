The wit and wisdom of Shaquille O'Neal

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/sh-758628.jpeg)

Classic Shaq quotes in no particular order, except that the leadoff quote is HBD-related … just to make this a true GNXP post …

> Nobody wants to get dunked on by a white guy. >
> Tell Yao Ming I said this: “Ching-chong-yah-wah … *ah-soooo* …”  
> **Yao Ming’s response:**  
> Chinese is a hard language. >
> Some things you just can’t question. Like you can’t question why two > plus two is four. So don’t question it, don’t try to look it up. I > don’t know who made it, all I know is it was put in my head that two > plus two is four. So certain things happen. Why does it rain? Why am I > so sexy? I don’t know. >
> **After winning the state high school basketball championship:**  
> REPORTER: Shaquille, what do you attribute your team’s success to?  
> SHAQ: I attribute it to me. >
> I’m like the Pythagorean Theorem. Not too many people know the answer > to my game. >
> One time I put up 40, 50 points dunking on Shawn Bradley. After the > game he brought his family over. He was like, “This is my wife. She > wants to take a picture.” I’m like, “Nice to meet you.” I smile into > the camera, take the picture, and then feel guilty about dunking on > him so many times. >
> I knew I was dog meat. Luckily, I’m the high-priced dog meat that > everybody wants. I’m the good-quality dog meat. >
> Pat Riley is a good-looking man. It’s my job to keep him looking good. >
> **Rolling down the window of his SUV while driving through South > Central and shouting at the top of his lungs:**  
> I … AM … *THE SON OF JOREL!* >
> The Spurs? They’re a good WNBA team. >
> I am Superman. And the only thing that can kill Superman is > Kryptonite. And Kryptonite doesn’t exist. >
> Y’all reporters like my quotes, don’t you? Yeah. My quotes are > Shaqalicious. >
> Me shooting 40% at the foul line is just God’s way to say nobody’s > perfect. >
> **After a 25-point comeback victory against the Boston Celtics:**  
> They shot the ball well early. What comes out of the microwave hot > doesn’t always stay hot. I know, because I eat bagels in the morning. >
> I had an awful first quarter but I picked it up. To all you single > guys out there, it’s not how you start the date, it’s how you finish > it, sir. A lot of people can, you know, start the date with flowers > and candy, but if you don’t finish the date … you know what I mean? >
> **When asked how he would defend himself:**  
> I wouldn’t. I would just go home. I’d fake an injury or something. >
> **When describing his MBA classmates’ reaction to him:**  
> “They would all say, ‘You’re not like we thought you would be. You’re > not as smart as we thought that you would be.'” >
> **When asked to compare Penny Hardaway, Kobe Bryant, and Dwayne > Wade:**  
> The difference between those three is the Godfather trilogy. One is > Fredo, who was never ready for me to hand it over to him. One is > Sonny, who will do whatever it takes to be the man, and one is > Michael, who if you watch the trilogy, the Godfather hands it over to > Michael. So I have no problem handing it over to Dwyane. >
> I’m like Pampers, toothpaste, and toilet paper. I’m proven. To be > good. And useful. >
> **On returning from a trip to Europe:**  
> REPORTER: Shaq, did you visit the Parthenon?  
> SHAQ: I don’t know. I can’t really remember the names of the clubs > that we went to. >
> They call me the Big Sewer because I have a lot of shit in my game. >
> **When asked whether the Sacramento Kings might dethrone the > Lakers:**  
> I’m not too worried about the Sacramento Queens. >
> I’m tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just > want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok. >
> Utah had beaten us in the playoffs the year before, and my knee was > screwed up, so Greg Ostertag was scoring, blocking a couple of my > shots. I guess it gave him confidence. Lord knows, after seeing his > game, he needs it. I went to talk to him after a practice and let him > know he needs to just play and not talk. I said, “Man, you need to > watch what you say,” And he was like, “Fuck you, watch what *you* > say.” So I was like, “Oh, you bad now?” I wasn’t even mad, it was like > a reflex. My openhanded right came up and smacked him upside his > crewcut head. He went down, fetal position, whining, “My contact > lenses, my contact lenses!” If Ostertag had known I’d taken Tae-Bo > with Billy Blanks, he wouldn’t have said that. >
> **On why Phil Jackson assigned him to read *Thus Spake > Zarathustra*:**  
> Nietzsche was a difficult book to read. Nietzsche was so unique, they > thought he was crazy. I guess Phil thinks I’m very unique to a point > where I may be crazy. >
> **When asked about his relationship with Kobe Bryant:**  
> I’m a married man. A married man doesn’t want to have a relationship > with another man. So stop asking me about it … OKAY? >
> **On his physical conditioning:**  
> My weight numbers, sometimes it’s going to be a higher number, and you > mere Earthlings, when you hear a high number, you’re automatically > going to think it’s fat because you’re only of this planet. But no, > I’m just a big, sexy, beautiful man that’s up in the 340s, 350s.
