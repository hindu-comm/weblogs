Nicholas Wade in Current Biology

[Hit it up](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4KXDWXW-6&amp;amp;_coverDate=09%2F19%2F2006&_alid=451702575&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6243&_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&_acct=C000047944&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=918210&md5=646db3c1e4bdb23bd260564f8fd2715b) if you have access. For the less fortunate:

> Were you surprised at the reaction to the book? Yes. The human past is > a touchy subject because many people use it – quite misguidedly in my > view – to reason from what was to what ought to be. You mustn’t say > people practised cannibalism in the past because that would justify > cannibalism today. Despite its absurdity, this argument makes almost > every attempt to reconstruct the past controversial. >
> In my book I tried to let the facts speak for themselves, a somewhat > more original idea than it may sound because some writers about the > deep past, like the otherwise very readable Jared Diamond, start with > explicitly political premises and adduce facts to support them. I > cannot see that this is a justifiable scientific procedure, the > popularity of Guns, Germs and Steel notwithstanding. Having compiled > my apolitical account, I figured the conclusions that had emerged > would be about equally vexatious to the right and the left. But so > far, which I hadn’t expected, the book has had more attacks from the > left, particularly for the lese-majeste (accents removed by CM, cos i > dunno the codes for’em) of saying our recent ancestors, far from being > noble savages, were a lot more savage than we are. >
> What has been the reaction of the scientific community? Many people > have been kind enough to tell me they liked the book, though I wasn’t > sure how to interpret the comment of one biologist who said he read it > on nights when he couldn’t get to sleep. I’ve been a little > disappointed it hasn’t received more reviews from scientific journals > because it has enough references for scientists to follow the > technical background. Both Nature and Science assigned the book for > review, but to dreary ideologues who assailed my failure to discover > that political correctness has been evolution’s guiding principle all > along, though fortunately they managed to find no other errors. I > think these journals would have served their readers better with > apolitical reviews.
