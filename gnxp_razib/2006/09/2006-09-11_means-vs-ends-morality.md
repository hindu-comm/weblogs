Means vs. Ends & morality

A few days ago Alex Palazzo [posted](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/09/the_moral_instinct.php) about [Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/gp/explorer/0060780703/2/ref=pd_lpo_ase/102-3605398-8339304?ie=UTF8). The title is pretty self-explanatory. The author has a [Moral Sense Test](http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/) that you can take. I took it. If you plan on taking the [Moral Sense Test](http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/), please click now before you read further and get “spoilers.”  
Back? Below is my summary, you can compare it to yours.

This makes a little sense, as my libertarianish tendencies have a mild skew toward means as opposed to ends. Reading [Anarchy, State and Utopia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/explorer/0465097200/2/ref=pd_lpo_ase/102-3605398-8339304?ie=UTF8) will do that to you….
