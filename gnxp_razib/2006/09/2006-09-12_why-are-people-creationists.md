Why are people Creationists?

John Wilkins has a [two](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/09/why_are_creationists_creationi_1.php) [part](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/09/why_are_creationists_creationi.php) series up about why people are Creationists. He plans to continue it. John starts within the [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality) paradigm, which has a lot going for it. The only thing, which John might get to, is that rationality is not just bounded, it is [strong biased](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/endless-forms-most-continuous.php) toward particular conceptual structures. Children are not just indoctrinated into a Creationist narrative, they tend to prefer it when they are *not* taught otherwise. Psychologists like Paul Bloom have found that children are [generally intuitive Creationists](https://mixingmemory.blogspot.com/2006/03/thinking-about-evolution-cognitive.html) when young, but those raised by non-Creationist parents shed these beliefs, while those raised by Creationists do not.

Update: [Part 3](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/09/why_are_creationists_creationi_2.php) is up. John hints at cognitive parameters. Part 4 is coming up.

Addendum: I will offer my own personal childhood experience with evolution. My parents never talked about this issue, and I didn’t know that my father was a Creationist until I was a teenager (yes, I’m not close to my parents obviously). When I was 8 I checked out a book from the library about the “origin of humans” (I was into paleontology so I assumed it was about human evolution). That book turned out to be a Creationist book all about Ham, Shem and Japeth as the founders of the human race, and I was enraged and bitched out the librarian when I returned it as I believed there was some intellectual fraud going on here (I didn’t say it in those words). I can’t really recall the first time I read about evolution, probably when I was 7 as that was age that I had an avid interest in dinosaurs. I personally never found it peculiar, as I don’t even recall being surprised or confused by the concept. It was as natural an idea for me as a God in heaven is for many children. Only in my teenage years did I comprehend that other humans might not find evolution such an “obvious” idea.

Update II: [Part 4](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/09/why_are_creationists_creationi_3.php).

The main issue I would have with John’s model is that I am personally skeptical of the reasoning powers of most of the human race. Nations with [higher rates of acceptance of evolution](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/creationist_turkey_shold_not_b.php) are not necessarily ones where the populace is more well educated, rather, they are simply ones where organized higher institutions tend to accept evolution as a given, and so people avow the belief which is socially accepted. The US, and many Muslim nations (for example) have powerful elite counter-evolutionary movements in the form of religious literalism.
