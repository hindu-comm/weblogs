Pope

[Aziz](https://cityofbrass.blogspot.com/2006/09/apology-accepted-but-damage-is-done.html) & [Randall](http://www.parapundit.com/archives/003727.html#003727) on the the Pope affair. Though I’d say both of them would broadly fit into the center-Left or center-Right coalitions, I’d also say that both tend to read the facts first before drawing conclusions….

**Update:** Ed Brayton [has more](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/09/the_pope_vs_islam.php). As does our [Catholic brother](https://darwincatholic.blogspot.com/2006/09/uncivilized-conduct.html) in Darwin.
