Foxp2 and genomic imprinting

The American Journal of Human Genetics has a new [preprint](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/preprints.epl) up that tentatively suggests that there is a parental specific [genomic imprinting](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/social_life_genomic_imprinting.php) associated with [FOXP2](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002079.html). I’ve put up the PDF as “foxp2.pdf” in the [GNXP Forum](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/gnxpforum/files/). In short, it seems that the paternal copy might be overexpressed relative to the maternal copy. Anyone care to offer an explanation for why the male copy (which would presumably be less genetically close to the other male copies in a sib-cohort) might want FOXP2 overexpressed relative to the female copy?
