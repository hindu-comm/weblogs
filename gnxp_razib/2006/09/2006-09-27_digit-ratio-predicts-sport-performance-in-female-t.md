Digit ratio predicts sport performance in female twins

[From the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5382814.stm):

> A King’s College London team found women whose ring finger is longer > than their index finger are more likely to achieve higher levels in > sport. The ratio between the fingers has already been linked to traits > in men like cognitive ability and sperm count. The study appears > online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The researchers, > from King’s Twin Research Unit, examined hand X-ray images of 607 > female twins aged 25-79 from the UK. In each case they measured the > lengths of the second and fourth fingers of each hand. The volunteers > also ranked their highest level of achievement in a list of 12 sports > on a questionnaire. The researchers found women with longer fourth > fingers were significantly more likely to be among the top achievers > in all the sports listed.

I can’t find the paper online, but I’d like to see it because the news report hints at that the result has a more fascinating twist.

> Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector said: “The reasons for these > findings are unclear. “Previous studies have suggested the change in > finger length was due to changes in testosterone levels in the womb > but we also found that finger length was 70% heritable with little > influence of the womb environment. **“This suggests that genes are the > main factor and that finger length is a marker of your genes.”** The > ratio between the two fingers is fixed before birth and remains > constant during life.

So perhaps the digit ratio is also largely heritable. Can anyone find the study?
