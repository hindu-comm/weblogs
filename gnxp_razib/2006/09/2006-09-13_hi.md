Hi

The regulars here know me pretty well by now, but I’ll introduce myself anyway. My name is John Emerson, and I’ve been a commenter here for some time. Over the last few months I’ve made some long comments which really should have been posts, and finally I asked Razib for posting privileges. My own site is [Idiocentrism](http://www.idiocentrism.com); the most interesting page there for most people here would be my archive of writings on [Eurasian history](http://www.idiocentrism.com/eurarch.htm), especially those dealing with the Mongols, the nomads, and the steppe.
