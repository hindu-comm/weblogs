The Pope's address

[Read the Pope’s address the University of Regensburg](http://zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=94748). His erudition and precision of speech leaves me pleasantly disposed toward him despite the many intellectual bones I have to pick with his argument. Living in the United States religious leaders are generally rather “populist” in their speech and habits, a nice change.
