Data access to the GSS

[Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/) made a series of interesting posts about the [General Social Survey](http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/GSS/). I recently noticed that GSS data are available thru [a very useful web application](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss04). Click that link to a go at it. Below the fold is a brief primer on what I’ve learned from playing around with it.

If you want to jump right in, get started with Row=WORDSUM, Column=GOD.  
Also fun: Row=POLVIEWS, Column=CHILDS

[Getting started help page](http://sda.berkeley.edu/HELPDOCS/helpgo.htm)

useful “Analysis” options:  
\* Frequencies or crosstabulation – produces heat-map tables like Half Sigma’s posts  
\* Comparison of means – useful to compare WORDSUM scores between groups  
\* Correlation matrix – useful for “pairwise” correlation matrix  
\* Comparison of correlations – compare correlations when controlling for another variable  
\* Multiple regression – multiple R

The lower left panel is a topic-sorted index of variables. Pick a variable from the list and click “view” to get a description. Use this panel to build your queries, or type in variables yourself.

useful variables:  
\* SEX (1=male, 2=female)  
\* AGE  
\* ~~RACE~~ RACECOMB (1=white,2=black,3=other)  
\* WORDSUM – a 10 Q vocabulary test  
\* EDUC and DEGREE – measures of education  
\* INCOME – family income  
\* GOD, IMPCHURH, GODCHNGE  
\* CHILDS, AGEKDBRN, CHLDIDEL

filtering: to limit an analysis to a subset of the total population  
\* example: “age(18-50), racecomb(1)” = Whites age 18-50
