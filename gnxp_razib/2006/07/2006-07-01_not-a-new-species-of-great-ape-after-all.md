Not a new “species” of Great Ape after all

A [few years ago](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002853.html) there were [reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3730574.stm) of a new great ape in the Congo, perhaps a chimp-gorilla hybrid. As the story unfolded it seemed more and more plausible that this was a local morph of the common chimpanzee, and genetic tests [have confirmed](http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,19625346-5001028,00.html) that hunch. It is a subspecies of common chimpanzee, though with unusual morphological features. The latter is important, we see a wide range of phenotypes among humans across small distances, so it should not surprise if chimpanzees also exhibit variation.
