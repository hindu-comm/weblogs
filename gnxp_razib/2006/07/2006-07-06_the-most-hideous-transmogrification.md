The Most Hideous Transmogrification

This is too good not to share – Razib takes on the [persona](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/07/is_pure_pedantry_the_superfici.php#comment-128771) of a more “enlightened” being. Could this be a Sokal Hoax in the making or have we lost Razib, as he transcends to a higher plane of being?

Later in the day, we see him [getting used](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/07/nature_on_science_blogs.php#comment-128788) to his new liberal skin:

> **DFX:** *Plus, you’re much better looking than PZ!* >
> **Razib:** itz a sad statement of our culture that gratuitous comments > about physical appearence are considered “amusing” by some.

When a commenter, who must obviously be blind to his own privledge, rebukes Razib, we see the full emergence of “Sensitive Man” with this [comment](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/07/nature_on_science_blogs.php#comment-164259):

> **DFX:** *Some might argue that it’s a worse statement of our culture > when people lose their sense of humor.* >
> **Razib:** humor is the Privilege of heterosexist white males. perhaps > the key is that for you “our culture” is bounded by your own > eurocentric biases, while as a person of color i have to live every > day with a culture of oppression.

I used to have to scour the darkest corners of the feminist and liberal blogospheres to find this kind of mindset, but now we have it close to home.

What, oh what, could be causing this hideous transmogrification? Could it be a satirical virus of some sorts, too much interaction with people who think like that, or something more sinister? If you ask me, this is a shout out for an intervention!

Update from Razib: I [“explain” myself](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/07/stupid_feels_might_good_am_i_i.php) yo!
