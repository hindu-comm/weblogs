Worker does not infer from mtDNA alone….

[Evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/07/empty_dna.php) has a [nice little post](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/07/empty_dna.php) up on the problems with mitochondrial DNA ([mtDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MtDNA)) in regards to using it to infer demographic history. This form of genomic information is useful in that it is relatively copious, being present in the hundreds of [mitochondrion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion) to be found within every cell. This is one reason that the early work on [molecular clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock) in the context of paleoanthropology used mtDNA, you needed a lot of raw material in the pre-[PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCR) era. Remember [mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_eve)?  
Now that neat story is fallling apart as the reality that mtDNA is subject to a great deal of selection seems to be clear, and selection tends to distort the [coalescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory) methodology which lay at the heart of these clock models. All this is a prelim for what I really want to highlight, John Hawks [**enormous review**](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/weaver_roseman_2005.html?seemore=y) titled [Selection, nuclear genetic variation, and mtDNA](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/weaver_roseman_2005.html?seemore=y). I would say that John was a selectionist before selectionism was sexy…but well, if some of you know the history of evolutionary biology, that doesn’t seem to work right….
