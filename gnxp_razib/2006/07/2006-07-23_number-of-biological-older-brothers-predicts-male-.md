Number of biological older brothers predicts male homosexuality

Here is another interesting new paper in *[PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/28/10771)*. The abstract:

> The most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in > men is the number of older brothers (fraternal birth order). The > mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. In this article, I > provide a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., > social/rearing) mechanisms. Four samples of homosexual and > heterosexual men (total n = 944), including one sample of men raised > in nonbiological and blended families (e.g., raised with half- or > step-siblings or as adoptees) were studied. **Only biological older > brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including > nonbiological older brothers, predicted men’s sexual orientation, > regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These > results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal > birth-order effect.**

The same issue has a [commentary](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/extract/103/28/10531) that reviews the research in this area. The authors propose a mechanism summarized in their Figure 1:

> A mother carrying a first son has very little exposure to the proteins > he is making because of the placental barrier. But upon delivery and > the inevitable mixing of fetal and maternal blood, her immune system > will now see proteins it has never seen before, including proteins > encoded on her son’s Y chromosome. If she mounts an immune response to > these proteins, then any subsequent sons will be exposed, via active > transport across the placenta, to maternal antibodies directed against > the male-specific proteins. These maternal antibodies might then > perturb development of the younger son, decreasing birth weight and > affecting his brain to increase the probability that he will grow up > to be gay. Whether this is what is really happening for sexual > orientation remains to be seen, but it is a provocative hypothesis.

I leave it to others to evaluate this specific result and the broader hypothesis in mechanistic and evolutionary terms. (One thought of mine: a potential mechanism more generally for greater male variability in all traits? An easily testable hypothesis.) As I read them, these papers are not in conflict with Greg Cochran’s [germ theory of homosexuality](http://www.isteve.com/Infectious_Causation_of_Disease.pdf).

Coffee Mug Addendum: There is a [colorfully written commentary](http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/145/2/475) in Endocrinology for free that sums up some of the research into neurobiological and endocrinological mechanisms determining sexual preference. Sheep seem to be a good model system for this issue, and the above papers imply some fairly explicit predictions about birth-order effects in homosexual sheep.
