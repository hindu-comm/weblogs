It's hard out here for a vole

I’m sure many here are familiar with the [prairie vole – montane vole story](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2004/06/16/love_is_a_virus.php) regarding mammalian monogamy. Prairie voles are more monogamous than montane voles. The two types have different distributions of Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 1a (avpr1a) expression in the brain. In a [Science paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/5728/1630?ijkey=8938fde65b2b0b086404347a1c2d4e8ccb3407a0&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) a little over a year ago, Hammock and Young reported that the DNA upstream of the avpr1a gene in prairie voles contains a bunch of short tandem repeats (STRs), and that the number of these repeats tracked with receptor distribution and with monogamous behavior. They also took a look at the DNA upstream of human, chimp, and bonobos and found repeat elements in common between humans and bonobos (more monogamous) that aren’t found in chimps (less monogamous). The implication is that tandem repeats work the same way in primates as in voles, and that polymorphisms here are directly linked to the complex behavior of monogamy.

It was a damn fine story, and it’s a shame to see it go, but check this PNAS paper out:

The paper makes two major points:

1.  There are a whole lot of non-monogamous vole species missing the
    STRs. 2.  The STRs in primates are about 5X further away from the avpr1a gene,
    and they are repeats of a different motif.

While there is still room for the STRs to modulate behavior one way or another, this report seems really damaging to the notion that arginine vasopressin receptor expression is a central component.
