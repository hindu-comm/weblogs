When less is more: founder flush

A [population bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck) has a tendency of reducing the long term [effective population size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_population_size) ([harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean)) a great deal. I’m sure all of you knew that, and I’m sure you know that it also has a tendency of reducing variation. This is because low effective population sizes increase the power of [genetic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift), which tends to expunge variation from a population.¹  
Great. The only thing though is that *sometimes* bottlenecks can “release” variation and make it available for selection. Additive genetic variance (heritability) *increases* as the genetic background is fixed on many loci, but not all, via a [founder flush](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/4/1191). I point this out just to suggest that sometimes the inferences drawn from population genetics can go against our *expectation*, because expectation in a probabilistic science must be modulated by *variance*.  
1 – The approximate time until fixation of a neutral, that is totally dependent on drift, mutation is 1 X 4 X effective population. So, if you crank down the effective population new mutants will fix very quickly in populations and you have a situation where transient polymorphism is reduced.
