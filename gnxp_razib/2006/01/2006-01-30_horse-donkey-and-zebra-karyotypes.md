Horse, donkey, and zebra karyotypes

I though this was interesting because a) I don’t know much about higher order genetic changes (chromosomal rearrangements, etc.) b) we’ve talked about [chromosome \# differences](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/wild-horse-and-other-knots.php) between wild and domestic horses before (they are full interfertile). Anyway, I know [aneuploidy](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ghr/glossary/aneuploidy) is usually the problem, but I think there will be some really interesting stuff coming out of this area (I wonder if [RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) could offer more?).
