A note on "Science Blogs"

Some of you have probably read the [recent article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/business/media/20adco.html) about “[Science Blogs](http://www.scienceblogs.com)” in The New York Times. I announced that I was starting a [sister blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) to this weblog about a week ago. A few points of note:

1\) There will be many posts that you can find [there](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) that you won’t find here. Though the content and linking will intersect, there will be a great deal of material exclusive to either weblog (this is a group weblog, the other one is not, so that should be obvious)..

2\) With that in mind, I would ask that you:

- Add the other blog’s [RSS
  feed](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/index.xml). - Or, bookmark it. - Or read it regularly

3\) If you are a weblogger, I would appreciate it if you would add a link to that weblog as well as this one, as [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) did.

As I said a few weeks ago, I don’t know where this is all going, so I will update you if I receive a vision from God as to how to differentiate the two weblogs more clearly. Right now there just hasn’t been much [lineage sorting](http://www.qmw.ac.uk/%7Eugbt991/mammals/week2slides/sld019.htm). And if you care about that sort of thing, I suspect I will be posting much more on both weblogs in the near future for a bit.
