One question to ponder….

Excuse a moment of blog navel gazing, but a few minutes ago I was curious how high the “10 questions” I’ve been asking have made it up on google. I was surprised, 10 for [John Derbyshire](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=john+derbyshire&btnG=Search), 9 for [Armand Leroi](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=armand+leroi&btnG=Search), 8 for [Dan Sperber](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=dan+sperber&btnG=Search), and 3 for [Warren Treadgold](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=warren+treadgold&btnG=Search). That is, all interviews are on the front page of google if you query their names. [Ken Miller](https://www.google.com/search?q=ken+miller&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&start=40&sa=N) at 41 is the odd one out here. I have an interesting person in the pipeline who I think GNXP readers will be very excited about, so “watch this space.”
