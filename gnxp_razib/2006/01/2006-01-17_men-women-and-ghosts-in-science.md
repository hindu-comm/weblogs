"Men, Women, and Ghosts in Science"

[A refreshingly honest discussion about the impact of distributional gender differences on science in PLoS Biology](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040019)

> Some have a dream that, one fine day, there will be equal numbers of > men and women in all jobs, including those in scientific research. But > I think this dream is Utopian; it assumes that if all doors were > opened and all discrimination ended, the different sexes would be > professionally indistinguishable. The dream is sustained by a cult of > political correctness that ignores the facts of life-and thrives only > because the human mind likes to bury experience as it builds beliefs. > Here I will argue, as others have many times before, that men and > women are born different. Yet even we scientists deny this, allowing > us to identify the “best” candidates for jobs and promotions by > subjecting men and women to the same tests. But since these tests > favour predominantly male characteristics, such as self-confidence and > aggression, we choose more men and we discourage women. Science would > be better served if we gave more opportunity and power to the gentle, > the reflective, and the creative individuals of both sexes. And if we > did, more women would be selected, more would choose to stay in > science, and more would get to the top.
