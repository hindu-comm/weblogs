The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics

I have a [long review](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/01/every_ratio_31_1.php) of [The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684636/geneexpressio-20/) at [my other blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/). The take home message is that scientists are dumb, just not as dumb. Remember, evolution does not shape perfection, just good enoughâ€¦.
