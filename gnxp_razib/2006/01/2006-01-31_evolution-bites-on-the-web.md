Evolution bites on the web

When I use terms not in regular circulation like [linkage disequilibrium](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Linkage_disequilibrium.asp), or those which I suspect aren’t as well understood as I think they should be, like [random genetic drift](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Genetic_drift.asp), I usually make reference to the [companion website](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/) to Mark Ridley’s text [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405103450/geneexpressio-20/) (if you followed the links to the terms you will note this). If you have a little spare time you should check it out, it isn’t too taxing. Of course, those with a strong lay interest in evolution might want to purchase Ridley’s Oxford Reader anthology, [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199267944/geneexpressio-20/). This is the closest thing to “airport reading” that I’ve seen that still remains technical enough to add value to your knowledge base.
