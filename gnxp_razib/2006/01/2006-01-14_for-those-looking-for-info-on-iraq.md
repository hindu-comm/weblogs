For those looking for info on Iraq…

Over the past several days I have been asked by more than a few people as to where they could find raw statistics and information to give them an idea of what is happening in Iraq. As a result, I have decided to take just a few minutes and write up this short post describing where everyone can find a horde of fairly objective stats and info.

The best place to go is the homepage of the [Iraq Index](http://www.brookings.edu/fp/saban/iraq/index.htm), published by the Brookings Institution’s Saban Center for Middle East Studies. It is updated and published on a bi-weekly basis in Adobe .pdf format and contains lots of data compiled from a myriad of news sources. Just be warned, like every other think tank around, the Brookings Institution has a political bias (it leans to the center-left).

Secondly, the Department of State publishes the [Iraq Weekly Status Report](http://www.state.gov/p/nea/rls/rpt/iraqstatus/) in .pdf format every Wednesday. I don’t think it’s as useful or as comprehensive as the Iraq Index, but it still has some fairly good information. Of course, it takes a pro-administration position.

And finally, here’s [Emily Hunt](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC10.php?CID=36)… I’m linking to her for no particular reason other than the fact that she’s a hot and seems to know a lot about terrorists, which I think makes her even more hot.

Hope this helps a bit. This post was about giving readers information, not debating the war, so please don’t bless us with political hackery on the issue; let’s leave that to the talking heads.
