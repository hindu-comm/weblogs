Aquaforming

Everyone and their mother has commented on the [water found on Enceladus](http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/03/09/cassini.enceladus/). There is speculation about life. If life doesn’t exist on Enceladus, and to a good second approximation we should know in a few decades, **I suggest seeding the moon with Terran organisms that might be able to survive and flourish**. In a few decades genetic engineering might also progress to a point where exotic prokaryote metabolisms could be synthesized with the physiology of more complex aquatic organisms.  
Nuts? Yeah, probably, but so what. I don’t believe that God exists, but I suspect It might in the future. Someone should start practicing.
