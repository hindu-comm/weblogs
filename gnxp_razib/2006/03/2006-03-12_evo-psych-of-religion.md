Evo Psych of Religion

I stumbled upon this [talk](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm) by Steve Pinker on the evolutionary psychology of religion thatâ€™s about a year and a half old. Nothing out of the ordinary, but concise (and a pretty good intersection with many of my own ideas).
