Still evolving….

Nick Wade has a new article out, [Still Evolving, Human Genes Tell New Story](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/science/07evolve.html?ex=1299387600&en=039ecd5836bc6b0e&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss). Nothing that should surprise, **selection happens**. I’m a little surprised that [Spencer Wells](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000240.html) is putting in so much face time in Wade’s article, to me this suggests that he might be moving on to his new schtick, studying [human morphological variation](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003267.html) as opposed to scientific genealogy. The [original paper](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072) is in *PLOS*. I’m not going to do the cut & paste thing, this is a free paper that you have access to, if you are a GNXP reader ***read the whole thing***. Remember, a) selection is stochastic, they come close to saying [what I said](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/race-is-skin-deep.php) about the new skin color locus b) this paper misses sweeps that have already moved toward fixation. Expect far more in the next 6 months….

Update: I’ve put up a [short summary](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/03/the_morphing_man_evolution_hap.php) of the paper at [my other blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/03/the_morphing_man_evolution_hap.php).

Update II: Check out this [commentary](http://anthropology.net/user/kambiz_kamrani/blog/2006/03/07/mapping_out_recent_evolution_on_the_human_genome) from Anthropology.net.
