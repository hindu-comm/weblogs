Fitness is a bugger!!!

In my post below where I try to synthesize [The Superficial](http://thesuperficial.com/) and [The Causes of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691024421/geneexpressio-20/) I used the term “fitness.” Well…as [Matt McIntosh](http://catallarchy.net/blog/) pointed out the term itself is problematic, and so using it as a reference of any sort is really sketchy. Evolgen has [slammed the use of “genetic load”](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/12/mean-fitness-genetic-load-and.html), and I I think the skepticism is warranted to some extent. The originator of the [formula](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Genetic_load.asp) for genetic load, [JBS Haldane](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/12/mean-fitness-genetic-load-and.html), [famously](http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,,1345180,00.html) quipped *“fitness is a bugger!”* Part of the problem is that the term “fitness” has unique connotations in evolutionary biology. Physical fitness, health and longevity, often *correlate* with reproductive fitness, but the correspondence is not 1:1. In fact, in many species there is likely a correlation between extremely fecund but short-lived individuals and fitness, their reproductive value, while longer-lived individuals within the population would exhibit less fitness. This is [antagonistic pleiotropy](https://www.supercentenarian.com/ageing.html) at work, short-term benefits outweigh long-term consequences, evolution is not “concerned” with long-term designs when weighed against short-term success. Those who fail in the present do not live to fight another day.  
Ultimately the issue here is the distinction between the *fact* of evolution and the *theory* of evolution. The process, the description, is pretty clear via a wide range of inferences. But the specific theoretical models are still being worked out, and many of the constructs of population genetics can be accused of excessive [reification](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=reification). Yet, as I said, evolution is about short-term windfalls, **and the utility that abstractions offer us may simply be a necessary aspect of doing the science in the present as opposed to waiting for a future when our empirical methods and analytic techniques catch up to our ambitions**. Hubris is in our nature. Charles Darwin formulated his theories before Mendelian genetics, and the [Modern neo-Darwinian Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis) rests upon the tenuous backs of the [Wright-Fisher models](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecture-notes/notes.html). Myself, I believe that the work of Haldane, Sewall Wright and R.A. Fisher may finally be brought down from the heavens and tested in the trenches because of rise of the [genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics), quantitative evolutionary models necessarily needed an enormous quantity of raw data to explore their assumptions and consequences with sensitivity.
