The happy housewife returns

Turns out all housewives [aren’t complete pill-popping wrecks](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-op-allen5mar05,0,5753747.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions). Go figure.

> Here are the figures, published in this month’s issue of the journal > Social Forces: 52% of wives who don’t work outside the home reported > they were “very happy” with their marriages, compared with 41% of > wives in the workforce. >
> The more traditional a marriage is, the sociologists found, the higher > the percentage of happy wives. Among couples who have the husband as > the primary breadwinner, who worship together regularly and who > believe in marriage as an institution that requires a lifelong > commitment, 61% of wives said they were “very happy” with their > marriages. Among couples whose marriage does not have all these > characteristics, the percentage of happy wives dips to an average of > 45.

Personal reflection: With most women in the workforce, how comparable are the housewives of today with the housewives of yesteryear?
