Godless perspective

Data from [The American Religious Identification Survey](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/aris_index.htm) is floating around the blogosphere right now. One of the points noted is that the number of Americans who avow “No Religon” has gone from [8.2% to 14.1%](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/images/image004.gif) of the American population between 1990 and 2001. Now, one meme floating around is conflating this increase with an increase in the number of atheists. But, one has to be careful, **just because someone rejects organized religion does not imply that they reject theism** ( belief in a personal God). In fact, just because someone rejects theism does not imply they reject organized religion (many Unitarian-Universalists, Buddhists and Jains and some Hindus reject theism but are members of an organized religion). The aggregate total for *The American Religious Identification Survey* for atheists and agnostics is \~1%, and this is probably an underestimate (the term “atheist” and “agnostic” are scary to many people), but it gets to the point that **the majority of people with no religion** are probably believers in a God or Higher Spirit. This is what is reported in [One Nation Under God](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517882183/geneexpressio-20/), the 1994 book which analyzes the findings of the 1990 survey. Now, I do think there is a trend against traditional organized religion in this country as more and more people seek their own individualized solutions to their “problems,” but this might lead to an increase in the sales of [The Mountain Astrologer](http://www.mountainastrologer.com/) as opposed to [The Skeptic](http://www.skeptic.com/). I see this in my day-to-day life, I live in a town where religion isn’t cool, but “spirituality” is in, and hard-headed rational empiricism is definitely a sour note. Instead of rejection of Christianity leading to a constraining of the field of magical possibilities, for these people a whole new world of superstition has come into play. Books like [The Cultural Creatives](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609808451/geneexpressio-20/) argue that this non-religious but still magical mindset is what is going to fill the vacuum as the “Old Time Religion” goes into decline. Of course, just because someone is silly doesn’t mean they are dangerous, much better karmic mumbo-jumbo than [theonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theonomy).  
**Related:** For an international perspective on these issues of belief and non-belief, I recommend [Religion in the world at the end of the millennium](http://www.gallup-international.com/ContentFiles/millennium15.asp) and [What the world thinks of God](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/programmes/wtwtgod/pdf/wtwtogod.pdf) (PDF).
