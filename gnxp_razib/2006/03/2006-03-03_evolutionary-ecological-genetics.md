Evolutionary & ecological genetics

[Michael Wade](http://www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/Wade.html) at IU has an interesting entry in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on [Evolutionary & Ecological Genetics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-genetics/). Wade hits the major themes starting from the Modern Synthesis, and the R.A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J.B.S. Haldane era, down to the issues that have arisen in the molecular era and Kimuraâ€™s Neutral Theory. The entry pays a great deal of attention to E.F. Ford and the ecological genetics program at Oxford.
