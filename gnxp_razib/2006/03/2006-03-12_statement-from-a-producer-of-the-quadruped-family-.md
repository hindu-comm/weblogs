Statement from a producer of the quadruped family film….

I am going to cut & paste whole a comment from [Jemima Harrison](http://www.passionateproductions.co.uk/who.htm) of *Passionate Productions*, who is behind [the upcoming documentary](http://www.passionateproductions.co.uk/) about the family who exhibits quadruped locomotion:

> The mutation on 17p has been identified by a Turkish/German team in > Berlin headed by Professor Stefan Mundlos. They suggest, some would > say controversially, that this mutation could have knocked out a gene > that plays a role in bipedal walking, atavastically exposing an > earlier form of walking.  
> Professor Humphrey believes, however, that this mutation has merely > caused the cerebellar hypoplasia confirmed by MRI scans, and which > makes it so difficult for them to balance upright. He argues that it’s > likely to be a conjunction of other factors that has kept the siblings > on all fours. These include what seems to be a familial predisposition > to bear-crawling as children (all 19 children, including all the > healthy ones, did it), and a mix of other cultural influences such as > lack of a pro-active health service.  
> But whatever the mix of nature and nurture, the family still raises > some interesting evolutionary questions. They mostly use a diagonal > gait better suited to branch-walking than terrestial walking > (suggesting it could still be hard-wired in us). They are also > palmigrade rather than knuckle-walkers, and the paleoanthropologists > have expressed interest in seeing what impact walking this way has had > on their skeletons. It could help them tease out what anatomical > features are and are not important in the fossil record.  
> It is also interesting that they balance extremely well on four, > showing none of the ataxia they display on two. This has led another > researcher, Dr John Skoyles (LSE), to suggest that the gene that has > been knocked out might be one which has a role in humans’ > “superbalance” ability.  
> As you might imagine, we have been dismayed by some of the newspaper > reporting. Not one major newspaper has reported the science accurately > – a result, of course, of a widespread lack of understanding of even > basic scientific principles. There has also been considerably > confusion over which scientist is saying what (is is only, for > instance, the Turkish scientist, Professor Uner Tan, who suggests they > are a wholesale genetic throwback).  
> Our film will, I hope, redress the balance and be seen as a sensitive, > thorough and thought-provoking record of the family/phenomenon. We > made it not for voyeuristic reasons (although of course the > quadrupedal siblings are visually arresting) but because we thought it > raised all kinds of fascinating scientific, and many other, questions. > I think the reason it’s created such a fuss because bipedality is > something that defines us as human beings – separate and distinct from > beasts – and their existence is challenging philosophically. You only > have to look at the Bible, for instance, to see how the word “upright” > is loaded with meaning about purity, morality etc. That’s ingrained > very deeply in us.
