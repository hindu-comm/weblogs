Sexual synergy

Dan Jones has [a very thorough review](https://psom.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-sex-is-good-and-not-for-obvious.html) of the [recent paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7080/edsumm/e060302-15.html) in Nature which argues that negative epistasis will emerge out of sexual reproduction and so perpetuate itself. The only thing I’ll add is what W.D. Hamilton noted in [Narrow Roads of Gene Land](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198503369/geneexpressio-20/), questions of fitness need to be evaluated over the long term, rather than just across a few generations. Also check out the [lead author’s blog](https://newtonsbinomium.blogspot.com/2006/03/resistance-is-not-futile.html).
