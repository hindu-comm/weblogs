Hand movements

I have a friend who is a graduate student in evolutionary biology at an elite university…and she told me that when she went to a seminar on [adaptive landscapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_landscapes)…everyone was making hand movements and gesturing wildly. She pantomimed it out for me, it was pretty funny.
