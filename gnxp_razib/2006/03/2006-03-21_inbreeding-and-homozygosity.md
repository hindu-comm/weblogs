Inbreeding and homozygosity

As [my previous posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/03/bedouin-pedigree-collapse.php) should have made clear the biggest short term problem caused by inbreeding is that deleterious alleles will be “unmasked” in their homozygous state. The individuals in question don’t necessarily have a greater proportion of deleterious alleles in regard to their genome content, but, there is likely to be less [complementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementation_%28genetics%29). So, this paper, [Quantification of Homozygosity in Consanguineous Individuals with Autosomal Recessive Disease](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v78n5/43033/brief/43033.abstract.html):

> Individuals born of consanguineous union have segments of their > genomes that are homozygous as a result of inheriting identical > ancestral genomic segments through both parents. One consequence of > this is an increased incidence of recessive disease within these > sibships. Theoretical calculations predict that 6% (1/16) of the > genome of a child of first cousins will be homozygous and that the > average homozygous segment will be 20 cM in size.

Please note these researchers are British, and [and Britain has a serious problem](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4442010.stm) with inbreeding and their Muslim population.
