John Hawks on introgression

[The whole post](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/evolution/introgression/hawks_cochran_introgression_2006.html) is worth reading, but the money shot:

Greg Cochran [has more](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/now-it-can-be-told.php). Obviously this work builds upon the Lahn introgression paper. Instead of crude species typologies the data is now pointing to a more complex set of relations between gene lineages.
