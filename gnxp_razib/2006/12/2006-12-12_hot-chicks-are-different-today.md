Hot chicks are different today….

The virginity thread generated a lot of response. The virgin lot of the nerd, ah, so cliche. And yet now I’m having a really weird moment, I’m at the local wine bar and a very attractive hostess¹ is recommending books in the science fiction genre to another (far less attractive) hostess. So far I’ve heard *Ender’s Game*, *Hyperion* and *Snow Crash* tossed off as appropriate for a “newbie.” Is this the Twlight Zone??? Am I a freak to think this is freaky? I haven’t had a sip of wine, so it isn’t the alcohol.  
**Update:** She’s reading *American Gods* I notice (taking a break).  
**Update II:** Smokin’ ScienceBlogger [Shelley comments](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2006/12/hot_chicks_may_be_different.php). For the record, the key issue for me was the intersection of science fiction && female physical hotitude.  
**Update III:** On second thought, I think the [Princess Bride era Robin Wright Penn](http://www.melofanas.lt/katalogas/images/goods/35763_Robin_Wright_Penn.jpg) is probably a better description of the “Hot Girl.” And another tidbit for those wanting to make this about science & women, I am to understand that this individual (I am a regular) is a history major.  
1 – Think Reese Witherspoon’s more attractive brown-haired cousin.
