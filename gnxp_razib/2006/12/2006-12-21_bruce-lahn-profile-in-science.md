Bruce Lahn profile in Science

The week’s Science has a [two](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/314/5807/1872)–[part](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/314/5807/1871) profile on [Bruce Lahn](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/10-questions-for-bruce-lahn_10.php) which includes some new information on research into [ASPM and microencephalin](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/this-is-bruce-lahns-brain-on-aspm-and.php). One of the two articles in entirely devoted to the flurry of articles disputing various claims about the two genes. Full text below the fold.

It’s always been clear (from a scientific standpoint) that the claims of an IQ link were premature, at best (and indeed, there’s no talk of it in the papers), and as Dr. Lahn noted in his [10 questions](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/10-questions-for-bruce-lahn_10.php), his other speculations are clearly labeled as such. But the claims that the variants are not at all under selection are probably specious. The technical comment published in Science was [essentially crap](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/selection-controversy.php), and it’s impossible to so far impossible to judge the other, unpublished results. Time will tell, time will tell…
