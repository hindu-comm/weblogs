Religion is merely a contemporary issue?

[NPR: Harvard Reconsiders Core-Course Requirements](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6597183)

> Harvard University is rethinking what future graduates should be > required to know. The latest plan stresses general knowledge about > “how the world works,” rather than academic methodology. The idea is > to make classes more relevant to the modern world.

Perhaps it’s just a bit of biased editing, but the NPR clip makes the opposition sound stupid. I especially note the prof who appears to be arguing that knowledge of religion is a passing fad like horses and buggies. I also have to disagree with the notion that top scientists can’t be expected to teach a survey course — at least if they’re any good at teaching.

**Update:** In the comments, epicurus points out [an op-ed by Pinker](http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=515314) that sheds some light on the reasoning behind the criticism of the religion requirement. While I still know very little about the report in question, Pinker’s criticism of the stated reasoning behind the science requirement appears apt: “My first reservation pertains to the framing of the ‘Science and Technology’ requirement, which aims too low.” On religion:

> Again, we have to keep in mind that the requirement will attract > attention from far and wide, and for a long time. **For us to magnify > the significance of religion as a topic equivalent in scope to all of > science, all of culture, or all of world history and current affairs, > is to give it far too much prominence.** It is an American > anachronism, I think, in an era in which the rest of the West is > moving beyond it.
