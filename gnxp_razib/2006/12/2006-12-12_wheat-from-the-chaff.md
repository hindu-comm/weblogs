Wheat from the chaff

To prove that someone actually blogs about even nerdier stuff than me, I direct you to the [Daily Transcript to learn about the endoplasmic reticulum](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/12/different_types_of_signal_sequ.php#more) and how it deals with poorly constructed proteins. My only point of reference in all of this basic cell biology is that I care about [eIF2alpha kinases](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/07/how_the_er_deals_with_stress.php) because they provide an interesting way to [upregulate some proteins in the face of a global decrease in translation](http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.micro.59.031805.133833). I have a pet theory that the sort of stimulation that leads to synaptic plasticity is a form of cellular stress that could locally activate some of these same processes. I recommend following his links to the [introductory material](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/12/ribosomesrpss_structures.php). There are a lot of abbreviations to get down.
