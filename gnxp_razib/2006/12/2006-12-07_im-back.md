I’m back!

Thanks to Chet for filling in, but now I’m back! Your long Snicker nightmare is over! I kid, but seriously, I appreciate Chet’s contribution, and he’ll be guest blogging in the future. I’ll be helping Chet set up a [weblog](http://chetsnicker.com/) where he can focus on his two passions: Austrian economics & radical feminism, and how the former can be used in the service of the latter. Stay tuned!
