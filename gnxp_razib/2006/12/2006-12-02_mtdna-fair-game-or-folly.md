mtDNA, fair game or folly?

[RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/12/filling_the_empty_dna.php) and [Kambiz](http://anthropology.net/user/kambiz_kamrani/blog/2006/12/01/so_wait_does_population_size_influence_mitochondrial_genetic_diversity_or_not) comment on a [paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5773/570) which argues for the utility of mtDNA in [phylogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeography).  
Remember,

- there is lots of mtDNA that is easy to extract because there are so
  many mitochondria within eukaryotic cells - it mutates fast, building up a lot of genetic variation, in a neutral
  matter (i.e., perfect “clock”) - it is uniparental, passed from mother to daughter, making the
  [coalescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory) model
  congenially tractable
