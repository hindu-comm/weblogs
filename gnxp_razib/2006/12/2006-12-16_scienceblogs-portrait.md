ScienceBlogs portrait

[![friendsforever.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/12/friendsforever.jpg?resize=200%2C217)![friendsforever.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/12/friendsforever.jpg?resize=200%2C217)](http://scienceblogs.com/year-in-science/)Check out the [ScienceBlogs group portrait](http://scienceblogs.com/year-in-science/). They caught me chillinâ€™ with my buddy PZ. I wonder if the designer who worked on this ran out of brown pixel, cuz Selva & I look mighty pink! Chris Mooney out front looks a bit uncomfortable. And straight up, WTF are Evil Monkey & Mike Dunford doing???
