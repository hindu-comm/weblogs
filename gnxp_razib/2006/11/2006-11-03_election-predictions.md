Election predictions

I predict that the Democrats will be pick up 22 seats in the House and 5 seats in the Senate. These are uneducated guesses, but, if I’m close I’ll pretend that I had reasons to make these guesses after the election and generate a bunch of after the fact justifications for my random guess based on convential wisdom. This post will be far enough down the page that newbies won’t notice my bullshit.
