Beyond Belief 2006

[Chris of Mixing Memory](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/) points me to [Beyond Belief 2006](http://beyondbelief2006.org/Watch/), which is about “Science, Religion, Reason and Survival” (videos viewable online!) As Chris notes the list is heavily weighted toward scientists who don’t study religion and seem to be offering their own personal opinions. Ann Dryan seems to be aging gracefully.
