The art of seduction

Speaking of [Machiavelli](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/il-principe-as-evolutionary-force.php), here’s an amusing passage from the New Yorker’s profile (not online) of [Robert Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greene_(author)):

> Greene is not a libertine. Drawing upon a list of the nine seducer > types in his book (the Coquette, the Charmer, the Dandy, the Natural, > etc.), he is, as he told me, “a reformed Rake.” (Reformed rakes live > in a constant danger or recidivism.) He lives with his girlfriend, > Anna Biller, a filmaker and old-Hollywood fetishist, on whom he > practiced some of the tactics suggested in “The Art of Seduction.” > Having seen her around Santa Monica, he got himself invited to a party > at her house, where he slipped away to study her record collection. > Afterward, he invited her to a Dubussy opera that he knew would appeal > to her. Still, the victim resisted. So he asked her to his > thirty-seventh birthday party. He also invited seven other attractive > women, friends who, at his bidding, did little to dispel the > impression that they might be sleeping with him. It worked. He and > Biller have been together for ten years.

A move straight out of gc’s playbook?
