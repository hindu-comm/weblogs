Exhaling genes

From [Epigenetics News](http://www.epigeneticsnews.com):

Researchers at the Wadsworth Center, the public health laboratory of the New York Sate Department of Health, have shown it is technically feasible to detect DNA methylation using a simple breath test. Dr. Weiguo Han and Dr. Simon D. Spivack have tested seven patients by having them breath into a handheld device for 10 minutes, which forms a condensed vapor, to which the methylation assay is applied. The methylated form of all six tumor suppressor genes could be detected using the simple breath test.

The researchers hope that the test can be further developed into a non-invasive test for the early detection of lung cancer.
