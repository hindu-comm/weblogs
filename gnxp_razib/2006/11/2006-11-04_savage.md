O believers, did god not make you with hearts and does he not see all that you do??? Jesus Christ! Frankly, this kind of shit is why I get tired of the interminable without-god-all-is-permissible style of arguments, I mean, how big is the sample space of unexplored perversion and barbarity out there that all seeing god is deterring?

**Update:** Since we’re on the topic, [A New Generation of Adults Bends Moral and Sexual Rules to Their Liking](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=249):

So, no more bullshit about how religion can encourage morality without a citation of studies. I’m tired of reading your introspection.
