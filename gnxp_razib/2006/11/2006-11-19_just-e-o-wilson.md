Just E.O. Wilson?

Both [Jason](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2006/11/scientist_laureate.php) (TFK) and [John](http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2006/11/ask_a_scienceblogger_2.php) (SF) also give E.O. Wilson as the response to [Ask a ScienceBlogger](http://scienceblogs.com/channel/ask/). This is kind of disheartening. Can anyone think of another scientist who is plausible *and* alive? (obviously Carl Sagan would have been a good candidate) I mean, [James Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson) is an acerbic kook part of the time, Freeman Dyson is a bit [idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_dyson#Science_and_Religion), and [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) doesn’t cut a wide public profile. Like John Wilson “popped” into my head but I spent 15 minutes thinking of possible second options. For living Americans I came up empty.
