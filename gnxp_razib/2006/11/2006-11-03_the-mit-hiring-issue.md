The MIT hiring issue

I really enjoy Susumu Tonegawa’s work and writing. He runs the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and has produced some of the most technically sophisticated transgenic manipulations to answer memory questions. It’s too bad he got himself in a little hot water earlier this year. Apparently, there are major competition issues between the different institutes and departments involved in neuroscience research at MIT, and they heated up to an unhealthy level this past spring. [ScienceNOW](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/1103/1) has the whole story and the ad-hoc committee’s [report](http://web.mit.edu/provost/reports/AdHocReport_11_02_06.pdf). The report deals out the blame pretty evenhandedly across departments and department heads. I like how the McGovern Institute head basically answers to nobody.

In the end, Janelia Farm is a damn fine place to end up. It just [looks](http://www.hhmi.org/janelia/campus.html) way cooler than MIT and appears to have a similar ridiculous level of resources and star-studded faculty roster.

Where’ve I seen that name before? Oh… [Here she is](http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/).. ”I would’ve either blacked out or thrown up.”
