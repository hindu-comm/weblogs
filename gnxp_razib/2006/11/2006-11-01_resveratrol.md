Resveratrol

David Sinclair’s group has published (in a rush) their work on the health and longevity benefits of Resveratrol in mice. Nicholas Wade has [good coverage in the NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/science/02winecnd.html) and [Nature has a podcast](http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/v444/n7115/nature-2006-11-02.mp3), a [news article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444011a.html), and the [research article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature05354.html).

In Wade’s article, Sinclair says he, his family, and his lab are taking it at a lower dose than that reported in the Nature article. Have any of you been taking it? Wikipedia, for what it’s worth, [suggests there are problem with pharmacokinetics in pure resveratrol preparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol).

I assume that resveratrol itself cannot be patented, but Sinclair’s company is reportedly in the middle of clinical trails with a patentable (and more effective?) resveratrol analog.
