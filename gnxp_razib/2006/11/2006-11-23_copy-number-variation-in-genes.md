Copy number variation in genes

A new paper in *Nature*, [Global variation in copy number in the human genome](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/abs/nature05329.html), suggests that it isn’t just [SNPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphisms) that matter in regards to human variation. Those of you who are “in the know” aren’t surprised, so [this press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-11/hhmi-gvw112006.php) is a bit much. Along with a focus on gene regulation, this is a fascinating new area which expands our understanding of how we are how we are beyond the raw sequence. p-etr at [my other blog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/hapmap-and-copy-number-variation.php) has a [lot more](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/hapmap-and-copy-number-variation.php). [RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) has a post scheduled on this topic, I saw a preview when he published it to make sure it looked right. The [press](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article2007490.ece) is making a big deal out of this, so we’ll see where it goes….  
**Addendum:** Why does gene copy number matter? [The most obvious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_copy_number) way is that more gene is proportional to more transcription which results in more translation which results in more final protein end product. Sometimes this is good, sometimes it is not so good, and sometimes it doesn’t matter. [Genetics and Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2006/11/23/breaking-news-the-genome-is-complex/) has [much more](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2006/11/23/breaking-news-the-genome-is-complex/). And here’s an [article](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10646&feedId=online-news_rss20) in *The New Scientist* and [another](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2466842,00.html#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=World) in *The TImes*.  
*Exod 23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.*
