Radical Muslims are similar to moderates

[Foreign Policy](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3637) has a [interesting selection of charts](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3637). They show that “radicals” and “moderates” in the Muslim world are not *that* different. Below the fold is a chart which offers two facts  
1) Radical Muslims are, *on average*, more educated than non-radical Muslims  
2) Radical Muslims are, *on average*, more affluent than non-radical Muslims  
Should this surprise? I don’t think so. Look to the history of the United Kingdom, Protestant radicalism took root in the highly literate environs of East Anglia. Health and wealth are often conducive to religious utopianism and reformation.
