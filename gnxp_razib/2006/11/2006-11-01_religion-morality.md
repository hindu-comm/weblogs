Religion & morality

Apropos of [Alex’s post](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/10/the_moral_mind_ny_times_commen.php), from *The Barna Group*, [A New Generation of Adults Bends Moral and Sexual Rules to Their Liking](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=249):

Judith Rich Harris has suggested that most of the environmentally shaped attitudes which vary across the population are due to peer groups. Cognitive anthropologists have contended that ideas, reflective cognition and conscious choice, are far less salient than we like to think. It seems likely that morality and ethics existed before and apart from religion, and it is the latter which co-opted universal ethics, as opposed to the former emerging from the mind of God.
