Wade wades in….

Nick Wade [finally throws together](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/science/16neanderthal.html?pagewanted=all) a piece on Neandertals.

Update by agnostic: John Hawks also has a new [FAQ](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/neandertal/neandertal_genomics_faq_2006.html) on the implications and non-implications of the two new studies Wade reviews.
