Transexual Islam

This week’s selection from *Islam Online* is pretty strange, and involves transexuality and its relationship to Islamic law. Enjoy below the fold….

> *Question:*  
> I have a very strange question. I’am 5 months ago turned to Islam > alhamdulillah, I was a non-believer. Now I have a question about my > past. There are some answers but they are for a person who is already > Muslim. This is the question: I am a female woman in Holland but I was > born as a boy, I have the mind and the feelings of a woman here in the > Netherlands and also in outer countries they have operations to make > this possible. I know that this is haram for a Muslim, but the problem > is that I have this operation done when I was not a Muslim. Now I’m > years later turned to Islam and this operation can not turn back. Now > the question is: Does I bear the sin I have done in the past and can I > be a Muslim woman now that I maybe marry; I am really a complete woman > and wear the hijab. I hope you can answer me.  
> *Answer*  
> **In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.  
> All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be > upon His Messenger.**  
> Islam does away with everything that went before it. Now you have no > option but to continue to live as you are right now and don’t think > about the past. As for the marriage issue, if you, as you said, ARE > COMPLETELY A WOMAN, i.e. you are capable of getting pregnant and > having children, then absolutely you can get married. You should not > tell anybody about this operation unless it something related to your > own health.  
> **Allah Almighty knows best.**

Have a good weekend!
