Rain in the northwest….

It’s been a bit rainy in the Northwest, [Kevin Vranes](http://scienceblogs.com/nosenada/2006/11/all_bow_down_before_the_power.php) has some commentary. There is a joke that one reason that the Pacific Northwest is so unchurched is that God is all around us nature. Usually we are taking about majestic vistas, but sometimes it is also about the fury of the Lord.
