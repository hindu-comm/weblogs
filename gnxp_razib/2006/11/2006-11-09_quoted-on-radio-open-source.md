Quoted on Radio Open Source

Chris Lydon quoted me again on [Radio Open Source](http://www.radioopensource.org/its-wednesday-morning-was-it-good-for-you/) on the [post election episode](http://www.radioopensource.org/its-wednesday-morning-was-it-good-for-you/). It’s in the last 10 minutes of the podcast. He read this whole section from my post last night:

> The Democrats do not bring a smile to my face. They are lovers of big > government and righteous paternalism. It seems entirely likely than in > the next 2 years they’ll collude with our president in throwing the > borders open to masses of future potential voters, a helot caste who > will feed the flames of identity politics and class warfare. The > multicultural managerial elite and the corporate oligarchs will be > smile as the bulging pear-shaped American social system is replaced by > a triangle with a large base and themselves at the pinnacle. I was > born in a Third World country, and I might well just die in one, so I > guess I best get a move on to make sure that I’m nicely ensconsed in > the coming oligarchy. But that is the future, the danger down the > generations must for the moment cede ground to the government > abomination of the present. Sometimes the right hand needs the left, > and two wrongs do make a right.

I must say that it sounds a **whole lot more apocalyptic in Chris Lydon’s stentorian voice than in my mind’s ear**…I was tired last night, and frankly the whole [Neandertal introgression](http://scienceblogs.com/cgi-bin/MT/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=5&search=neandertal) story breaking when it did made me rather sour about the nasty business of politics. Most of what I posted really does reflect my cynical attidue, as the condescending Left-leaning commentator on the show observed (do I now look forward to a Republican pushback in 2008!). I don’t trust the Right or Left elites to perpetuate a middle class society, though I pray to a God that I don’t believe exists that I’m wrong. Anyway, it is worth listening to just to hear the kind of baffled responses, though [Meagan McCardle](http://janegalt.net/) handled it well, even if she is a corporate stooge. I mean, I was frankly shocked that Chris quoted me, I do sound like I’m not all there in that passage….
