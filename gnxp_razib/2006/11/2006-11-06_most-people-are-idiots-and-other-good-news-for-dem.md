Most people are idiots, and other good news for democracy

On the eve of the midterm elections, a [piece](http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/11/06/bryan-caplan/the-myth-of-the-rational-voter/) on the irrationality of voters. Excerpt:

> But why are there some areas– like politics and religion– where > irrationality seems especially pronounced? My answer is that > irrationality, like ignorance, is sensitive to price, and false > beliefs about politics and religion are cheap. If you underestimate > the costs of excessive drinking, you can ruin your life. In contrast, > if you underestimate the benefits of immigration, or the evidence in > favor of the theory of evolution, what happens to you? In all > probability, the same thing that would have happened to you if you > knew the whole truth. >
> In a sense, then, there is a method to the average voter’s madness. > Even when his views are completely wrong, he gets the psychological > benefit of emotionally appealing political beliefs at a bargain price. > No wonder he buys in bulk.
