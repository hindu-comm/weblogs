Austin W. Bramwell on conservatism

I really don’t know what to make of Austin W. Bramwell’s [piece](http://www.amconmag.com/2006/2006_11_20/cover.html) for [The American Conservative](http://www.amconmag.com/2006/2006_11_20/cover.html). He concludes thus:

> Whatever its past accomplishments, the conservative movement no longer > kindles any ‘ironic points of light.’ It has produced fewer > outstanding books even as it has taken over more of the intellectual > and political landscape. This trend will only continue. Worse, no > reckoning will be made: they hope in vain who expect conservatives to > take responsibility for the actual consequences of their actions. > Conservatives have no use for the ethic of responsibility; they seek > only to ‘see to it that the flame of pure intention is not quelched.’ > The movement remains a fine place to make a career, **but for wisdom > one must look elsewhere**.

Bramwell is a talented young lawyer, and his assault reads like the precise brief of a prosecutor bent on convinction. And yet, to where do we turn if all the various strands of conservatism stand guilty before us? Here’s hoping that Bramwell has a follow-up in the works. Over the past few years following Bramwell’s essays I get the sense that he is actually engaging in a game of intellectual [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29), fleshing out the broad outlines through a process of negation and encirclement, but perhaps I’m just hopeful….

**Addendum:** Bramwell is [married](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFDD1E38F934A3575AC0A9659C8B63) to the former Sarah Maserati. She is the [fellow Episcopalian](http://olimu.com/webjournalism/Texts/Commentary/Diary%202002-11.htm) that Derb alluded to in his [piece](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDBmYzcyZTgzNzNkYWM0MzY3YjE1ZThhZGJiMDRiZWE) about religion. Austin Bramwell is a [traditional Episcopalian](http://www.massnews.com/2003_Editions/4_April/040403_episcopalian_church_at_harvard.shtml) himself. How do I know this? When Bramwell burst onto the conservative scene I went looking for some information….
