Veiling, again

![Mattson.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/Mattson.jpg?resize=200%2C226)![Mattson.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/Mattson.jpg?resize=200%2C226)Over at my [other blog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/veils-part-n.php) another [post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/veils-part-n.php) on the veil. Also, check out the [interview](http://www.here-now.org/shows/2006/11/20061102_9.asp) with [Ingrid Mattson](http://www.hartsem.edu/faculty/mattson.htm), head of the [Islamic Society of North America](http://www.isna.net/). She has some pragmatic things to say about the veil, and the reality of living in a non-Muslim social context where the old rules no longer apply. Mattson is not a “moderate” in my opinion, I recall her being interviewed and stating that she rejected demonization of the Salafi position because she sees it as primal and originalist. Of course, Salafism is more diverse than terrorism, but it gives one a flavor her viewpoint.
