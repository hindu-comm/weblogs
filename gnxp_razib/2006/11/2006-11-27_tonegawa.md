Tonegawa

Are bloggers more like sharks in a feeding frenzy or vultures on deadmeat?

See [the populist](https://transientreporter.blogspot.com/2006/11/perfumed-class-tonegawa-malicious.html) rally the mob:

> Ah… the Perfumed Class. Our Lords and Masters, the Principle > Investigator Princes wandering over their incandescent domains, > bestowing upon their peasant postdocs, their servile grad students, > their precious beneficence… Don’t you love them?  
> …  
> In summary, I am sorry, but I have to say to you that at present and > under the present circumstances, I do not feel comfortable at all to > have you here as a junior faculty colleague.  
> Step off Logan Airport, and I’ll dip you in tempura batter, fry you in > peanut oil and eat you for dinner.

I love that he is able to riff off of Tonegawa’s ethnicity with such dexterity.

Oh and [here’s one](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2006/11/toadygawa_translated.php) who was even more clever with Tonegawa’s name. See how she replaced Tone with Toady! So CLEVER! Wish I could pat her on the head for it. “I like to think he was strong-armed into stepping down.”

Let’s do something besides join the dogpile.

Tonegawa [won the Nobel Prize](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1987/press.html) in 1987.

Since then he has been a leader in the development of [transgenic technologies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSN-41BD8MY-N&amp;amp;amp;_coverDate=12%2F27%2F1996&_alid=496839632&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=7051&_sort=d&amp;amp;amp;view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f4113a0ec48b432a0e079a9453ecd7cb):

These technologies have become indispensable in the study of memory. You can knockout whatever gene you want in just the portion of the brain circuitry that theory has pointed to as important. One of the first (if not the first) applications was the production of mice lacking NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The casual reader or layperson can basically equate NMDA receptors with synaptic plasticity, meaning the changes in neural transmission that underlie memory. These CA1-NMDAR KO mice suck at memory.

But Tonegawa also provides a refined behavioral and theoretical approach. The hippocampus has a strong flow of connectivity from area DG to CA3 to CA1. CA3 has highly recurrent connections and thus has been modeled as a pattern completion module. [Knocking out CA3 NMDA receptors](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5579/211) doesn’t have an obvious effect on memory like the CA1 version. Instead, one has to dig and understand clearly the role of different hippocampal subregions to find the CA3-KOs’ specific deficit.

More recently Tonegawa and colleagues have emphasized the role of [regulation of protein synthesis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSS-4DF3JBV-7&amp;amp;amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2004&_alid=496848574&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=7054&_sort=d&amp;amp;amp;view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=6639fc055dedc377f70ec42a6a625fe1) in memory storage, showing that certain pathways many equate with regulation at the level of mRNA synthesis (transcription) also regulate translation factors directly. This short circuits the loop. There is no need for a signal to travel from synapse to nucleus and back in order to make changes in the structure of a synapse. The same group has provided a unique theoretical insight in developing the [clustered plasticity model](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/clustered-plasticity-model.php) in which changes involved in memory storage are coordinated at neighboring synapses.

The papers in the [Arc-stravaganza](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/arc-o-mania.php) a couple weeks ago all cited Tonegawa (and other very important PI’s: Sur and Majewska) as [early empirical evidence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSN-4KH4DBN-R&_coverDate=07%2F28%2F2006&amp;amp;amp;_alid=496849265&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&amp;amp;amp;_qd=1&_cdi=7051&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=8add37495630178a6b96cfe320550146) that Arc plays a role in reducing noise in synaptic plasticity rather than directly increasing the strength of “signal” synapses as many predicted.

Just some light reading in case you get tired of too much cleverness. As I mentioned at [Shelley’s blog](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2006/11/an_indepth_look_at_mits_tonega.php), I think the peanut gallery could stand to quiet down some until they understand in technical detail the degree to which Karpova and Tonegawa were trying to achieve the same technology. I also agree with the original ad hoc report that we shouldn’t be privy to those emails. Unfortunately, we are privy because of some highly unprofessional and noncollegial media wagging performed by somebody besides our latest burning patriarchy effigy.
