Dogs are necessary when man is sufficient

[Wolf-to-dog transition had little to do with humans, ancient skull suggests](http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/18/wolf-to-dog-transition-had-little-to-do-with-humans-ancient-skull-suggests/). I think the headline here is deceptive. This is the important part:

> A Canadian researcher who specializes in the biology of ancient dogs > co-authored one of the most significant studies of the year in canine > science: a paper detailing the world’s earliest evidence of an animal > in transition from wild wolf to domesticated dog. >
> The “extraordinary preservation” of the creature’s **33,000-year-old > skull** — found in a cave in southern Siberia — has helped show that > dog domestication “was, in most cases, entirely natural” and not > really a “human accomplishment,” says B.C. evolutionary biologist > Susan Crockford. >
> She was part of a six-member team of researchers from Russia, Britain, > the U.S. and the Netherlands that turned the clock back on wolf-dog > transformations by thousands of years and showed that **the phenomenon > probably happened many times in many places around the globe.**

The co-evolution between social canids and primates is I think not a random chance event. To some extent I think “man’s best friend” was a necessary outcome of evolutionary forces. Barring the total extermination of one lineage or the other, **some sort of cooperative relationship is I suspect something that will naturally reoccur.** Dogs are not simply a specific derived lineage of wolves, they’re an ecological niche created by the existence of hominins with social complexity. Humans may not have domesticated wolves *per se*, but human societies are the ecological niche which a certain subset of wolves naturally adapt themselves to. And, I believe humans are pre-adapted to tolerate, accept, and even extol, the presence of philo-anthropic canids. In some ways they may be a preview for what is to come with intelligent social robots, which will draw upon the same cognitive reflexes.
