Congratulations to openSNP

For winning the [API Binary Battle](http://www.mendeley.com/blog/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/)! The *Nature News* [weblog](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/12/could_crowd_sourcing_provide_t.html) has a moderately overwrought piece on the possibilities for crowd-sourcing in genetics. Interestingly they report that [openSNP](http://opensnp.org/) only has 50 genotypes. That’s lame. Though I haven’t poked around the site much since I initially loaded my data. I’ll have to spend some time this weekend looking at it….
