James F. Crow in Genetics

At 95 [James F. Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Crow) is not only an eminent population geneticist, but he knew the figures who were responsible for the whole field. The journal *Genetics* has [commissioned](http://www.genetics.org/content/189/4/1127) a series of essays and perspectives in his honor. The first is by [Daniel Hartl](http://www.genetics.org/content/189/4/1129). I thought this was funny:

> Soon after joining the program I asked Professor Crow whether I could > join his lab as a graduate student. He thought for a moment and then > said, **“Yes, Dan, provided you understand that population genetics is > a recondite field that will never be of great interest except to a > small group of specialists.”** I remember this because afterward I > hurried to look up “recondite” in the dictionary. His admonition made > population genetics seem like some variety of monasticism, which, > being an admirer of Gregor Mendel, was all right by me. Little did > either of us foresee that genetics would be transformed in our > lifetimes by genomic sequencing on a population scale and the > development of computer technologies capable of analyzing terabytes of > data and that population genetics would become a key approach for > understanding human evolutionary history as well as for identifying > genetic risk factors for common diseases.

I had the privilege of [interviewing Crow in 2006](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/10-questions-for-jim-crow.php). My email requesting an interview was sent only on the smallest probability of a reply, but he replied immediately! And when I sent my questions again the reply was nearly immediate. My favorite of Crow’s answers: “In my view it is wrong to say that research in this area — assuming it is well done — is out of order. I feel strongly that we should not discourage a line of research because someone might not like a possible outcome.” At his age he’s seen many fashions come and go. But nature abides and persists.
