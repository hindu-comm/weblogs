Basque genetic distinctiveness (again)

With all the talk about [Basques](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/12/the-basques-are-genetically-distinctive/) I decided to do my own analysis with [Admixture](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/analyzing-ancestry-with-admixture-step-by-step/). [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/) gave me a copy of his IBS file, which has all the 1000 Genomes Spanish samples, including Basques. I merged it with the HGDP sample, which has French Basques (just “Basques” in the plots below) and French non-Basques. I pruned most of the populations, but kept the Mozabites, which are a Berber group from Algeria. The number of markers was \~350,000, and I ran it up to K = 8, or 8 component populations. I stopped there because the components were starting to break up in a very choppy manner.

In general I do think that **the idea that non-Basque Spaniards have Moorish genetic input seems supported.** It isn’t definitive though. And you have to be careful, there are lower parameter values where Sardinians seem to have an affinity with Mozabites to a great extent, even more than Spaniards. But that disappears as you move up the number of K’s. But who is to say which K is the correct K? The consistent Sub-Saharan African among non-Basque Spaniards (also evident in the Behar et al. data set) component probably convinces me that there was a Moorish impact, since these are likely to have come with the Islamic conquest, and not Phoenicians.

All the files from the Admixture run (and csv files with tabular results) [are here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8Tdg8RZEWOOZTI5NWNhZDMtN2FjNy00ZTcyLWI3OGUtZTY4MTlhMmY5ODQ0).
