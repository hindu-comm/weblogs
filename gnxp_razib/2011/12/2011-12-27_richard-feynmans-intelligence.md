Richard Feynman's intelligence

Interesting [interview](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201112/polymath-physicist-richard-feynmans-low-iq-and-finding-another) of [Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/). I’ll reproduce the part about Feynman:

One thing I have always wondered about is the fact that Richard Feynman had substantive accomplishments which marked him as definitively brilliant by the time he was talking about his 125 I.Q. score (which is smart, but not exceedingly smart). Intelligence scores are supposed to be predictors of accomplishments, but Feynman already had those accomplishments. Bright people take many psychometric tests, so there will be a range of score about a mean. My personal experience is that there’s a bias in reporting the highest scores. **But it may be that Feynman gloried in reporting his *lowest* scores because that made his accomplishments even more impressive.** Unlike most he had nothing to prove to anyone.
