Christmas reading

With some leisure, I plan to read a bit. Here is my tentative “stack”:

– [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670022950/geneexpressio-20)

– [Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East, 1750-1850](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400075467/geneexpressio-20)

– [Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674060326/geneexpressio-20)

– [Mirroring the Past: The Writing And Use of History in Imperial China](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0824829131/geneexpressio-20)

– [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002RKRUEA/geneexpressio-20)

– [Consolation of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0872205835/geneexpressio-20)

I also plan on browsing more of Brian and Deborah Charlesworth’s magisterial [Elements of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20) , and my friend [Joel Grus’](http://joelgrus.com/) [Thinking Spreadsheet](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0982481810/geneexpressio-20). I’m skeptical that I would prioritize fiction, but if I manage to read some, I’ll try and finish [The Sacred Band](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307739686/geneexpressio-20), the last in David Anthony Durham’s [Acacia](http://www.davidanthonydurham.com/novels/acacia.html) trilogy.

What are you reading for the holidays? (and if you aren’t reading for the holidays, why are you spending your marginal time reading this blog!)
