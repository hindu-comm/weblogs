The last word on dog genesis is not nigh!

In my [post below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/12/dogs-again-and-again/) Rob commented:

My general response is **not to accept the latest press release about the genetic origin of dogs.** I keep track of the literature and it’s rather fluid. For example, I woke up this morning, and this is what showed up in my RSS, [Modern dogs are more Asian fusions than Euro pups, study finds](http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10096):

I assume that as man’s best friend dog genetics is going to be where human genetics is in a few years. I’m not well aware of how good the dog reference genome is, though I hear the cat genome isn’t very good. After whole genome analysis gets going with humans I assume people will start looking at domesticates, companion animals as well as those with more direct economic productivity implications.
