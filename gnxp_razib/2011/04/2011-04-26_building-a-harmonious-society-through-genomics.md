Building a harmonious society through genomics

[Dan Vorhaus](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/author/dvorhaus/) points me to this *Newsweek* feature on [BGI](http://www.genomics.cn/en/index.php). My friend [Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/) gets some face time in the piece:

> …Last year, pharmaceutical giant Merck announced plans for a research > collaboration with BGI, as the Chinese company’s revenue hit \$150 > million—revenue projected to triple this year. “I admire their passion > and the willingness to take risks,” says Steven Hsu, a physicist at > the University of Oregon, adding that “it permeates the organization.” >
> … >
> Satellite research centers have been set up or are underway in the > U.S., Europe, Hong Kong, and four other locations in China, and the > number of researchers at the main headquarters in Shenzhen has more > than doubled during the past year and a half. The institute now > employs almost 4,000 scientists and technicians—and is still > expanding. >
> “I’ve seen it happen but sometimes even I can’t believe how fast we > are moving,” says Luo Ruibang, a bioinformaticist, who at 23, fits > perfectly within the company’s core demographic. The average age of > the research staff is 26. >
> Li Yingrui, 24, directs the bioinformatics department and its 1,500 > computer scientists. Having dropped out of college because it didn’t > present enough of an intellectual challenge, he firmly believes in > motivating young employees with wide-ranging freedom and > responsibility. “They grow with the task and develop faster,” he says. > One of his researchers is 18-year-old Zhao Bowen. While still in high > school, Zhao joined the bioinformatics team for a summer project and > blew everyone away with his problem-solving skills. After consulting > with his parents, he took a full-time job as a researcher and finished > school during his downtime. Fittingly, he now manages a project on the > genetic basis of high IQ. His team is sampling 1,000 Chinese adults > with an IQ higher than 145, comparing their genomes with those of an > equal number of randomly picked control subjects. Zhao acknowledges > that such projects linking intelligence with genes may be > controversial but “more so elsewhere than in China,” he says, adding > that several U.S. research groups have contacted him for > collaboration. “Everybody is interested in intelligence,” he says.

Knowledge, information, innovation, **these are the only ways that the human race will beat back the [Malthusian trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap) in our age.** The world is aging now, and many nations will be moving past [peak labor](http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/12/chinas_labor_force_expected_to.html) soon. We’ll need to be squeeze more productivity our of fewer at some point.
