Incest, "the children," and personal genomics

[Mischa Angrist](http://blogs.plos.org/genomeboy/) and [Brendan Maher](http://blogs.nature.com/nm/spoonful/2011/04/despite_demand_parents_urged_n.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews) point me to two interest personal genomics related stories. First, a follow up on inadvertent uncovering of incest story from last winter in *GenomeWeb*, [Incidental Findings](http://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/incidental-findings):

> Recently, he and his colleagues encountered a case in which a married > mother of three children with cognitive and developmental disabilities > — the eldest of which she conceived in a previous union — opted to > submit their genetic samples for screening. The researchers discovered > a span of homozygosity that indicated the oldest child was the product > of an incestuous conception between first-degree relatives. When they > informed the mother of what they found, Beaudet says she vehemently > denied such a relationship and demanded that the test be repeated. > “The test was repeated and \[the result\] was the same,” he says. “And > then she sort of broke down and said: ‘My husband will divorce me if > he finds out about this.’ … There are just a lot of difficult things > that come up.”

A few years ago professionals had discussions about whether they should even divulge this sort of information which might destabilize the family unit. In particular in relation to paternity. **I think that’s a moot point, the horse has left the barn.** Unless there’s a proactive effort by the powers that be to prevent consumers to from having *any* access to their own genetic information not facing up to these issues in the short run is probably just a matter of kicking the ball down the field. The only cases where I think it might be prudent would be when individuals have very short life expectancies, those with terminal conditions or the elderly. Otherwise you’re trying to run out a clock which will explode in your face.

Speaking of kicking the ball down the field, should children be tested for “adult” diseases? Some people think not, [Parents ‘want child gene tests’](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-13099090):

> Helen Wallace, from genetic science lobby group Genewatch UK, said: > “Online gene tests frequently give misleading results because most > common conditions such as cancer, obesity or diabetes are not > predicable from a person’s genes, except in special circumstances. >
> “Children should not be tested for risk of adult-onset conditions, > full stop. **They should be allowed to decide for themselves, with > medical advice, when they are grown up.”** >
> Dr Vivienne Nathanson, director of BMA Professional Activities, said: > “We would have concerns about genetic testing being widely available > over the internet or off the shelf because parents could find out > results without a health professional to help intepret them. They may > also find out about genetic abnormalities for which there are no > cures, or be caused needless worry.

From what I can tell [GeneWatch UK](http://www.genewatch.org/) is straight out of central casting for Left-science-neo-Luddite. In some areas vigilance is probably warranted, I’m not too sanguine about government intentions or execution either, but a lot of their material looks alarmist to the point of farcical. In any case, **disease knows no hard and fast distinction between children and adults at age 18.** I am going to get my children tested as soon as possible personally.

More information is not always better than less. But in most cases I think it is, and in the domain of personal health it almost always is.
