Checking for Alzheimer's risk with 23andMe

Dr. Daniel MacArthur at [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/04/happy-dna-day-heres-your-alzheimers-risk.php):

I don’t put much weight on 23andMe’s disease risk estimates since I have a relatively large pedigree, and my four grandparents all made it at least to age 75 (one made it to 100, and two to 80+), so I have some sense of my odds of late onset diseases. But, I will admit I was still a little anxious when “unlocking” my results for this locus. This is a classic “tail risk” event which hooks into all the cognitive biases which we as humans come preloaded with. I will probably die of cancer or heart disease, but not due to a mutation of large effect which exhibits Mendelian inheritance patterns.\* **But I still fear that possibility!**

Well, I don’t have the at-risk genotype. As someone who doesn’t focus too strongly on medical genetics I was surprised that Alzheimer’s is 60-80% heritable. This actually makes me someone less worried about this disease for myself, as across my extended pedigree this disease doesn’t seem to crop up very often (my grandparents experienced rapid mental degeneration all within the last year of their deaths, it wasn’t slow and gradual). Of course this is balanced by the recurrent issues with circulatory problems and such within my family. **But I take proactive efforts to mitigate the environmental component of risk elevation, as well as the gene x environment interactions.**

In sum, there’s no long term point in being ignorant. Though I will concede depending on your own psychology there may be a short to medium term benefit to not knowing your long term risks.

\* In fact, I don’t have much of a history of cancer in my family. So it will probably be heart disease. This is what killed all four of my grandparents, though my maternal grandfather did make it to 95 before being diagnosed with the illness.
