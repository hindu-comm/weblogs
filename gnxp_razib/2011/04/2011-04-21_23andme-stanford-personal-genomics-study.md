I released my [1,000,000 SNPs into the public domain yesterday](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/razib-khans-23andme-v3-genotype/). Why? To borrow a line from William Jefferson Clinton: **because I could.** And perhaps, because I should? Thereâ€™s nothing to fear. [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) hit all the salient points when that crew released their data into the public domain. **How about releasing yours?**

Also, I didnâ€™t consult my parents or my siblings about this decision. I weight the probability of downside risk to them trivially low. Far lower than the chance of them getting killed in a car crash. My genome, my right. Of course Iâ€™m no Howard Roark, a pure egoist. I asked one person of interest who might suffer some future downside risk with me, and they had no concern if I did this if my judgement was that the fear was unfounded. Honestly, Iâ€™m a cerebral person of the mind, a man of reflection, not action, but this act did make me feel as if Iâ€™m affecting a little bit of change in this world.

A friend on Facebook asked me if I wasnâ€™t worried about being [Gattacaed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca#Plot) in the future. No, not at all. Thereâ€™s nothing actionable in my SNPs, and once the scientific research catches up with the genotype data **I suspect that our full genome will be part of the record which institutions are already accessing routinely.** The technology to surreptitiously sequence and analyze the genetic information of others will be there, and will be used. The issue at hand is not *if*, but *when*. I think we need to confront the possibility of radical transparency as part of the near term future. Speaking of which: **how do you know that *is* my genotype?** Trust me, it is! ðŸ™‚
