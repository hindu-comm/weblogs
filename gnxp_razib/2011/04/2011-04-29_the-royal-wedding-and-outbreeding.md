The royal wedding and outbreeding

In the wake of [the post from earlier this week](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/outbreeding-wont-save-the-british-royal-family/) on the inbreeding within the House of Windsor (and current lack thereof), Luke Jostins, a subject of the British monarch, has a nice informative post up, [Inbreeding, Genetic Disease and the Royal Wedding](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/04/inbreeding-genetic-disease-and-the-royal-wedding.php). This tidbit is of particular interest:

That’s an interesting flip side of aristocratic [consanginuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguinity), aristocratic [cosmopolitanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev). For example, [Victoria of Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_Crown_Princess_of_Sweden), the heir to the throne, has a Brazilian maternal grandmother and German maternal grandfather. Her father is by and large of the Northern European aristocracy,\* but because he is of the [House of Bernadotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bernadotte) his [paternal lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_XIV_Johan_of_Sweden) is rooted in a region on the alpine fringe of southwest France. The European aristocracy then serves as an interesting window into how cultural context can shape genetic variation.

Also, a sidelight of curiosity is that [Duchess of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Middleton) (formerly Kate Middleton) has a maternal grandmother who comes from a lineage of laborers and miners. That’s certainly a commentary on the possibilities for social mobility. There is a strong likelihood that a 20th centuryworking class laborer will be the great-great grandparent of the British monarch at some point in the 21st century.
