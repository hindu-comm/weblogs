Fair & balanced on circumsion

When [Michelle](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com/) mentioned on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/physilology) that she was going to write about circumcision, I told her to expect some angry people to come out of the wood-work. Today she has a [post up at *Scientific American*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=whats-the-deal-with-male-circumcisi-2011-04-04), [What’s the deal with male circumcision and female cervical cancer?](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=whats-the-deal-with-male-circumcisi-2011-04-04) She concludes:

> In addition, while it is true that women with circumcised partners are > less likely to get cervical cancer, they are not immune. **Women with > circumcised partners still contract HPV and develop cervical cancer!** > They just do it at a reduced rate. >
> There are other methods that are much more likely to reduce a woman’s > chance of contracting HPV and developing cervical cancer, such as > vaccination and condom use. Therefore, from a public health standpoint > in the United States, it may not be necessary to circumcise male > babies solely for the purpose of reducing the risk of cervical cancer > in his future sexual partners (of course, this doesn’t take into > account the possibility that the child might not be heterosexual).

On the whole I think that Michelle’s take is reasonable and fair-minded. But, I think **numbers** are of the essence here. What is the expected reduction in rate of risk? This was the major bone I had to pick with Jesse Bering’s post on this topic last year at *Scientific American*. Bering closes on a [pro-circumcision note on public health grounds](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=is-male-circumcision-a-humanitarian-2010-04-23):

If I’m not being generous, I’d have to say that circumcising your son because he *might* live in Africa which *might* still have a rampant HIV epidemic 20-30 years from now, is **kind of a stupid decision if grounded on probabilistic logic.** After all the probabilities of the various outcomes contingent upon your priors matter. My future children will be raised in the United States of America. If male, they will likely be straight. They will probably middle to upper-middle-class. [HIV rates vary a great deal by demographic category](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/us.htm). I know I won’t allow my sons to be circumcised as infants. I don’t see the need, and I **am** familiar with the literature on the efficacy of mass circumcision in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in **some** environments.

**But,** if I lived in South Africa I might make a different decision based on the probabilities of my different environment. This is why I would dissent a bit from Michelle’s note that even women with circumcised partners can develop cervical cancer. Risk assessment, by its nature, should not be viewed dichotomously. To make proper decisions based on probabilities you need to take into account the magnitudes of all the risks.
