Paleoanthropological "telephone"

A few people have emailed me a link to this weird story, [Kashmiri Neanderthal soup not scoop](http://www.dailyindia.com/show/432988.php):

> The study, conducted by the UC Davis Anthropology Department at the > US, found that about four percent (ranging from two to five percent) > of all modern humans, except African descent, have Neanderthal genes > left over from matings between the two peoples in prehistoric times, > reports Greater Kashmir. >
> … >
> “You have numerous people with U2e, the European version of U2 living > in Europe, especially in Italy today, and Germany as well as other > places in Europe. It’s widely distributed throughout all of Europe in > current times. And you have India-specific U2i mtDNA living primarily > in India, especially NW India and Kashmir,” it added. >
> So, did people from India, Kashmir, and Pakistan as well as the rest > of Central Asia populate Europe?

Jean at [DNA forums](http://dna-forums.org/index.php?/blog/2/entry-137-kashmiri-neanderthal-soup-not-scoop/) traces the memetic mutations which led to this final product. It’s pretty funny, **but not that unsurprising.** One of the issues that is now occurring with the field of recent human origins is that because of genomics it is becoming rather technical, and requires a soft touch in terms of interpretation. But the subject matter is also very attractive to the press. The intersection is not always pretty.

**Addendum:** The origin of non-African humans in the zone between the Middle East & India itself is of course not that implausible. Geography imposes some constraints.
