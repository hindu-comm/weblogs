Browser share via Google Trends

I use [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends) a lot, but I don’t necessarily know if it’s telling me anything useful. So I decided to see if it might correlate well with browser share data. I know that [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) has been tracking their own stats for years, so I took their data from September of 2008 to September of 2011, and plotted the browser share. Below it are some trends from Google. Notice the pattern for Firefox and Chrome in particular.
