Ötzi, the dead sea scrolls of genomics?

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/10/icemans-genome-cometh-not-yet.html) points me to the fact that [Ewen Callaway](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/10/the_iceman_genome_cometh.html) has the dirt on what’s going on with Ötzi:

> To get a better grip on his ancestry and predisposition to disease, > Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in > Bolzano, and his team sequenced Ötzi’s 3 billion base pair nuclear > genome from a shard of hip bone.

\~90 percent of a genome is way more than you’d need for some basic analysis and inference of relationships to contemporary populations. So what’s the big deal? No idea, but this tardiness makes me turn the needle up in terms of assuming that they found some interesting stuff. If it’s what you’d expect, why recheck and beef up your analysis with as much support as you can find? Of course, **I hope that they found some interesting stuff**, so I shouldn’t trust my own judgments in this area. My own suspicion is that they have found extensive genetic turnover over the past 6,000 years in Western Europe, and they are using modern and ancient samples to flesh-out their model. The two dominant paternal haplogroups in Europe today, R1a and R1b, are suspiciously scarce in the ancient DNA samples.
