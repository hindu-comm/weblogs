When genetics comes in handy in politics

In *Mother Jones* [Andrew Serwer](http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/walid-phares-mitt-romney-lebanese-forces) has a [long profile](http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/walid-phares-mitt-romney-lebanese-forces) up of a Mitt Romney adviser who has associations with Lebanese Christian sectarian radicals. This section jumped out at me:

> Régina Sneifer, who served in the Fifth Bureau in 1981 at the age of > 18, remembers attending lectures where Phares told Christian > militiamen that they were the vanguard of a war between the West and > Islam. She says Phares believed that the civil war was the latest in a > series of civilizational conflicts between Muslims and Christians. It > was his view that because Christians were eternally the victims of > Muslim persecution, the only solution was to create a national home > for Christians in Lebanon modeled after Israel. Like many Maronites at > that time, Phares believed that Lebanese Christians were ethnically > distinct from Arabs. (**This has since proven to be[without > scientific > basis](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/lebanon/phoenicians-text/5).**)

The scientific issue is actually a little more complex than Serwer comprehends. It is true that Muslims and non-Muslims in any given region share a lot genetically, but non-Muslim minorities in the Middle East have gone through a long period of endogamy and demographic contraction, resulting in genetic differences (mostly obviously, they seem to have less Sub-Saharan African admixture than their Muslim neighbors). But the interesting point is how widespread genetic information is now becoming in trying to understand various issues. Serwer is broadly correct I’d say that the Maronite radicals who argue for a strong separation between the origins of their own people and the Muslim and Druze of Lebanon are not on solid basis, just as Muslim Arabs who believe that they are predominantly descended from *Arabians* are also not on solid ground.
