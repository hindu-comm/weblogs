The perils of human genomics

A friend pointed me to the heated [comment section](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111014/full/news.2011.592.html) of this article in *Nature*, [Rebuilding the genome of a hidden ethnicity](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111014/full/news.2011.592.html). The issue is that *Nature* originally stated that the [Taino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people), the native people of Puerto Rico, were extinct. That resulted in an avalanche of angry comments, which one of the researchers, Carlos Bustamante, [felt he had to address](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111014/full/news.2011.592.html#comment-id-27982). Eventually *Nature* updated their text:

> CORRECTED: This article originally stated that the Taíno were extinct, > which is incorrect. Nature apologizes for the offence caused, and has > corrected the text to better explain the research project described.

Here’s [Wikipedia on the Taino today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people#Ta.C3.ADno_heritage_in_modern_times):

It is undeniable that the Amerindian ancestry found in the Caribbean probably derives from that pre-Columbian population. And it may be that there are cultural forms which exhibit unbroken continuity. But it seems that the modern Taino are a **re-precipitation out of a cultural milieu whose Amerindian self-identity *had* gone extinct.** By analogy, [Argentines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_people) have about the same proportion of Amerindian ancestry as Puerto Ricans on a population-wide basis. In fact, over 90% of the Amerindian distinctive ancestry in Argentina is not found in self-identified Amerindians (who do continue to exist as a minority, especially in the South). But to my knowledge for various cultural reasons there has not been a groundswell to shift the Argentine self-conception from being a European settler nation to a mestizo nation, let alone individuals declaring themselves Amerindian.

In comparison to the possibilities which are opened up in this case, the issue of [Aboriginal genomics](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/2011/do-the-genes-belong-to-the-tribal-council/) looks rather cut & dried. I suppose we would laugh if some people decided to “reclaim” their Neandertal heritage, but there’s a huge corpus of paleoanthropological scholarship which these individuals could draw upon to reconstruct their identities as Neandertals. It might sound ludicrous, but this is a world where a lot happens that you wouldn’t expect.
