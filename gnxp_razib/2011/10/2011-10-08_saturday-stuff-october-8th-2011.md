1\) Post from the past, [One Nation Under Gods, and Mitt Romney, over before it began](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/one-nation-under-gods-and-mitt-romney.php).

2\) **Weird search query of the week**: “false jewish genetic studies racist.”he

3\) [Comment of the week](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/10/political-correctness-in-1900-and-2000/comment-page-1/#comment-94216):

> Frank Sweet’s “Legal History of the Color Line” is a good read on this > topic. One of Sweet’s arguments is that black leaders, particularly > Northeastern leaders, had a seminal role in the creation of an > artificial, fiat-defined African American ethnos. >
> I think Sweet stresses the centrality of black leaders too much. They > were more in a reactive, rather than proactive position vis-a-vis > white racial codes and attitudes. But, still, a worthwhile read and > this is not his central point. >
> The one drop rule wasn’t enforced effectively because the Jim Crow > system was not totalitarian, the funds for an effectively intrusive > bureucracy weren’t there. I think people are finally discussing the > many ways it was ignored in practice. I had relatives who were > remembered as “white colored men” in newspapers, and in one government > document from the 1930s was described as “white” with some black > ancestry. In other words, these are people who were legally and > socially white, they voted, their kids went to white schools, and they > married, but local memory knew that they had some African ancestry. My > father told me that as a child it was the equivalent of having a crazy > aunt in the family. >
> I read an old article from the Richmond Times Dispatch, by Walter > Plecker, a colleague of Grant’s, and the VA state registrar of vital > statistics. In the article Plecker was complaining about Greene > County, and some other counties, I believe, midwives listing mixed > ancestry children as Mexican. On the face of it, Plecker was correct, > the kids obviously weren’t Mexican. But it shows how Plecker was > relatively powerless in the face of local ad hoc decisions on who was > non-black and who wasn’t. Unlike the Nazis, he was not operating in a > totalitarian system. I’ve never seen these Mexican birth certificates, > they are still closed per state laws. Plecker also made an infamous > list of surnames, you can find it online, of mixed-race families.
