Modern humans in Arabia >100,000 years ago

The *genetic* model of the “Out of Africa” scenario is getting more complex. There may be [two waves](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/out-of-africa-onward-to-wallacea/), as well as the likelihood of [admixture](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-paradigm-is-dead-long-live-the-paradigm/) between the Neo-Africans and “archaic” hominins, such the Neandertals and Denisovans. From what I can gather the genetic evidence is now converging upon the sequence of events where African populations diverge \>100,000 years ago (e.g., a deep separation between the ancestors of the Bushmen and the ancestors of West Africans), and a radiation of non-Africans at most \~75,000 years ago, and more likely \~50,000 years ago. There are still many holes to be plugged in. While we’re waiting on genetics, here’s an interesting paper using archaeological methods in *PLoS ONE*, [The Nubian Complex of Dhofar, Oman: An African Middle Stone Age Industry in Southern Arabia](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028239):

> Despite the numerous studies proposing early human population > expansions from Africa into Arabia during the Late Pleistocene, no > archaeological sites have yet been discovered in Arabia that resemble > a specific African industry, which would indicate demographic exchange > across the Red Sea. Here we report the discovery of a buried site and > more than 100 new surface scatters in the Dhofar region of Oman > belonging to a regionally-specific African lithic industry – the late > Nubian Complex – known previously only from the northeast and Horn of > Africa during Marine Isotope Stage 5, \~128,000 to 74,000 years ago. > Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates from the open-air > site of Aybut Al Auwal in Oman place the Arabian Nubian Complex at > \~106,000 years ago, providing archaeological evidence for the > presence of a distinct northeast African Middle Stone Age > technocomplex in southern Arabia sometime in the first half of Marine > Isotope Stage 5
