There’s a chicken & egg problem with personal genomics. Until it gets ubiquitous and relatively transparent there is always going to be some letdown in terms of what it can, or can’t, tell us. But as long as there’s a letdown, it won’t become ubiquitous and transparent. That’s the [main reason](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/razib-khans-23andme-v3-genotype/) I put my genotype into the public domain. It doesn’t do me too much good or bad, **but I wanted to show people that there’s nothing terrifying about it.** Once the fear is gone, we can move forward and get some work done.
