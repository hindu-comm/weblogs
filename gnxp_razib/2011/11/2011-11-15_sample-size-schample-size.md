Sample size, schample size

[Ed Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/11/15/oxtr-gene-produces-differences-in-kind-behaviour-that-people-can-spot-in-20-seconds/) has a post up on a behavior genetic [publication](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/08/1112658108) where the sample size is 23. The researchers report a correlation between a [SNP](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs53576) on the [OXTR locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin_receptor) and “prosociality.” To make a long story short the sample size suggested to [Dr. Daniel MacArthur and Dr. Jospeh Pickrell](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) that this was a spurious correlation. The bigger issue here is that there are functional reasons to assume that some genes are correlated with normal human variation in psychology and behavior, and a robust body of literature that these traits are heritable (trait value is highly predictive across relatives), **but, the results associating a particular genetic marker with a given trait are much less robust.**

But I immediately realized something interesting: a sample size of 23 may be small, but there is a sample size potentially of thousands! I know my genotype at this SNP from 23andMe. How about some 23andMe customers get together and produce some results, and then get published in *PNAS*? A sample size of 230 would be easy I think, and you could probably push it much closer to 1,000.
