On structure, variation, and race

I noticed yesterday that [Andrew Sullivan, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and a cast of others](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/2011/11/29/the-sullivan-tnc-raceiq-debate/)were having a roiling debate on race and I.Q. My name came up in several comment threads on various issues. I’m aware of this because I have Google Alerts set for my name. I don’t have the time or energy to get immersed in this particular debate at this moment, but I did review some older material in the course of following links placed elsewhere. In particular, I encourage all of my newer readers to check out my friend Armand M. Leroi’s article in *The New York Times* from 2005, [A Family Tree in Every Gene](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/opinion/14leroi.html?pagewanted=print&position=&gwh=26A56B9BF7D19AF28D5A072FAABE0A1F). Though dated in a few particulars (e.g., we know the locus responsible for most variation in blue eyes now, and it seems likely that Andaman Islanders and Malaysian Negritos are not the original settlers of their domains) I think the general outline has held up rather well. Compare it to the numerous vociferous responses over at [SSRN](http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/). One wonders at the motivation for what seems like [massive retaliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_retaliation)! Here are a few critical paragraphs from Armand’s piece:

**The problem here is the word “race.”** It has a whole lot of baggage. So many biologists prudently shift to “population” or “ethnic group.” I don’t much care either way. Let’s just put the semantic sugar to the side. I contend that:

1\) Human populations can be easily separated into plausible clusters using a random set of genetic markers

2\) The differences between human populations are not trivial

You can say that both positions apply to human races. Or, you can say that race does not exist as a biological concept, and that both positions apply to human populations. Call it what you will, style is secondary to substance. Just as half-siblings and full-siblings are clearly genetically distinct, and those distinctions matter in terms of their traits, so French and Chinese are genetically distinct, and those distinctions matter in terms of their traits.

In the mid-2000s Armand, and at the time myself as well, put a great deal of weight on the importance of the elucidation of population structure for biomedical purposes. How else is one going to get funded by the N.I.H.? At this point I’m not sure that that’s going to be the low hanging fruit in the near term. Rather, **I think an understanding of the phylogeny of the human race is a grand story.** Population structure in the present is a shadow of histories past. And with the possibility of admixture with archaic lineages and recent adaptations that story has a lot of novel plot elements to keep your attention.

**COMMENTS NOTE: *Any comment which misrepresents the material in this post will result in banning without warning. So you should probably stick to direct quotes in lieu of reformulations of what you perceive to be my intent in your own words. For example, if you start a sentence with “so what you’re trying to say….”, you’re probably going to get banned. I said what I tried or wanted to say in the post. Period*.**
