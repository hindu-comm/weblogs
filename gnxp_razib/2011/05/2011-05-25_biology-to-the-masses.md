Biology to the masses

[Josh Roseneau](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/05/biopunks_biohackers_and_the_mo.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tfk+%28Thoughts+from+Kansas%29&utm_content=Google+International), when he’s taking time off from the [evolution-creation](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/culture_wars/creationism/) wars, is poking around his own genome. Some [sage advice](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/05/biopunks_biohackers_and_the_mo.php):

We need to **demystify DNA.** It’s pretty obvious to me that people perceive genetics to be in the domain of magic, when in reality it manifests itself in the banal realities of correlations within the family, which we’re intuitively aware of. But Josh’s post is more than just personal, he reviews the book [Biopunk: DIY Scientists Hack the Software of Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1617230022/geneexpressio-20):

I obviously support this movement and its intents (I’ve met a few of the people who are prominent in it). But we need to keep perspective here. This will probably be analogous to the free or open source software movement; the base of tinkers will be much larger than corporations and academic institutions, but it isn’t going to expand to cover the majority of the public. But so what? Most us can probably agree that the ad hoc decentralized elements of the software engineering community have done good just by putting pressure on the margins of staid institutions. Similarly, a minority of biology enthusiasts and hobbyists are going to shape the production and consumption of the plethora of new products we’re going to see coming online within the next few decades. There is often someone in the family who you turn to for tech advice. **Now there may be someone in the family who you turn to for personal genomics advice.** This is the democratization and decentralization of specialization!

When it comes to the mass consciousness aspect I think personal genomics and other consumer biotech will play a large role in demystifying DNA, and in the future making the public more open to the possibilities of bioengineering. Those of us alive today are on the cusp of a new age. I think the medium-term shape of that age is highly sensitive to initial conditions, so we should be both hopefully and [vigilant](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/2011/03/09/your-genes-your-rights-fdas-jeffrey-shuren-not-a-fan/).
