Osama bin Laden and the DNA match

[How they determine Osama bin Laden really is Osama bin Laden](http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-osama-bin-laden-dna-testing-20110502,0,5592328.story):

I checked and it seems that there are paternity testing outfits that offer one day turnaround. So I guess it’s not implausible that they could have pulled this off. I assume they still use [variable number tandem repeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling) for DNA profiling?

**Update:** [Yeah, short tandem repeats](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/science/03dna.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print).
