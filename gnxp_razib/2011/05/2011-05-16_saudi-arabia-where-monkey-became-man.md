Saudi Arabia, where monkey became man?

As late as the 1980s it is reputed that prominent Saudi clerics were making the [case for geocentrism](https://www.google.com/search?q=Ibn+Baz&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1#sclient=psy&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=1&tbm=bks&source=hp&q=Ibn+Baz+geocentrism&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=7e0927dad2e37ad6). Of course presumably most Saudis are not geocentrists, but their religious establishment is so calcified that medieval science still retains some hold upon their imaginations. That’s why I’m very, very, curious about the possibility which is emerging that a critical period of human evolution occurred in the Arabian peninsula. [Maju](https://forwhattheywereweare.blogspot.com) points me to a paper in *Quaternary Science Reviews* which reports on the discovery of a site in north-central Saudi Arabia, the heartland of the House of Saud, which suggests human occupation \~75,000 years B.P. [Middle Paleolithic occupation on a Marine Isotope Stage 5 lakeshore in the Nefud Desert, Saudi Arabia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBC-52V858H-1&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F12%2F2011&_alid=1752026712&_rdoc=13&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_zone=rslt_list_item&_cdi=5923&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=2715&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c920b4e6a9aef5808356bffe2488060c&searchtype=a+):

The material describing the site is basically Greek to me, so I had to “hum” my way through. Let’s jump to the final paragraph:

The main implication of this finding, if it stands the test of time, is that there is now an accumulating body of evidence that the model circa 2005 that modern humans speciated \~60,000 years ago in East Africa and exploded from a narrow tight locus to all regions of the world rapidly in the “Out of Africa” event simply can not account for all the evidence. Parts of it may still be correct. There were wide swaths of the world which *only* anatomically modern humans settled. Oceania, the New World, and Siberia, for example. But an arrival in Australia 40-50,000 years ago would far post-date a possible initial foray of African humans into Arabia \~75-100,000 years B.P.
