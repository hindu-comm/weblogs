23andYou

[Josh Rosenau](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/) just got his 23andMe results back. He asked me what he could do with it. Well, I might have told him that he should throw his genotype to the public domain…but most people are a little reluctant to do that it seems (though remember, if you want to do that just email me and I’ll publicize it. For example, [Blaine Bettinger](https://sites.google.com/site/mygenotype/) just put a bunch of stuff online public domain). I told Josh to look at some of the third party tools at the website [23andYou](http://www.23andyou.com/3rdparty). Focus on the left column in particular. I assume in the future the tools will get slicker and much more user friendly, but why wait until grandma gets into the game?
