Friday Fluff – May 6th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [10 questions for Judith Rich Harris](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-judith-rich-harris.php).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week** (#5 keyword!): “dutch best language”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“One root for rice”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/05/one-root-for-rice/#comment-68259):

> Timely paper! Rice agriculture must have been brought to India by the > Austro-Asiatics. But the the EDAR genes that the Austro-Asiatics also > brought with them do not seem to have been selected in India unlike in > East Asia. The Munda only have 5% East Asian EDAR while having 15 to > 30% East Asian ancestry. >
> Why did the East Asian variant lose its selective advantage in India? > The reason must be that EDAR selection in East Asia was by sexual > selection. Darwin proposed this to be the reason for non-adaptive > differences between the races. Sexual selection, especially for > cosmetic factors, is mostly a matter of female choice – while men may > prefer blondes they will readily settle for brunettes but women hold > out for Mr. Right. The Austro-Asiatics spread in India by their men > marrying local women. These women did not care one way or the other > for the thick straight hair of the Austro-Asiatic men but chose them > for their agricultural skills! Thus the East Asian EDAR gene got > diluted to a low level.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
