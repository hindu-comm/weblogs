How to make your genome public domain

I just got a request from someone how to do this. Honestly I really don’t know, I’m not a lawyer, and lawyers make the simple complex. Great if you’re an innocent guy accused of a dastardly crime, but not so great when you’re trying to do something simple with minimal hassle. So it’s really a question for everyone out there. I just went to the [Creative Commons website](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and filled out a form and dumped their short legal statement. Is this kosher? Will a lawyer sue me for putting my genotype in the public domain? (I’m being facetious!) Comments welcome. A few people on twitter have thrown out the idea of having a full-service website which serves as a repository for genotypes which people want to put into the public domain.
