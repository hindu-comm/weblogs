Turtleneck & Chain – geekcore extraordinaire

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/05/514xBzG4DlL._SL500_AA280_.jpg?resize=280%2C280)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/05/514xBzG4DlL._SL500_AA280_.jpg?resize=280%2C280)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004YRCAEO/geneexpressio-20)A few days ago [I praised](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/05/the-lonely-island-genius/) *The Lonely Island’s* new album [Turtleneck & Chain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004TSDWMM/geneexpressio-20). Though I assumed I’d already heard most of the best songs via their [videos](http://www.thelonelyisland.com/) I still was curious enough to pull it down on iTunes. Unfortunately iTunes decided to freeze up, so I checked out [Amazon Cloud](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore). I was surprised at the painlessness of the 5 minutes required to purchase [the MP3s](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004YRCAEO/geneexpressio-20) and then download them to my phone (via the Amazon MP3 Android app). I’m going to check out if this would be a better option for my podcast subscriptions.

As I’d guessed most of the best songs *were* turned into music videos. There are also tracks which are vaguely familiar because they mix & match elements of raps which you’re already familiar with. So the album isn’t a total replicate than of what you can find on the internet already. Even tracks which are familiar are not exact copies.

One thing I have to observe is that there is a strong **[geek as opposed to nerd](http://www.wolfgnards.com/index.php/2009/07/01/the-definitive-nerd-vs-geek) sensibility in *The Lonely Island***. Only a geek would reference a sexual encounter between Atreyu and Falcor! [Turtleneck & Chain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004TSDWMM/geneexpressio-20) lacks the dense thickness of [nerdcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerdcore_hip_hop) to be sure, but I don’t think anyone could have expected that. Imagine the [12 year old Aaron Carter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAJBxiEgElc) gone dirty and geeky.

Probably the funniest song which *wasn’t* turned into a video was “No Homo.” Let’s just say that I think it would be impossible to really make a video that could pass any rating system for what’s being described by the middle of the song, unless you go [Team America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_America:_World_Police) and rely on puppets.
