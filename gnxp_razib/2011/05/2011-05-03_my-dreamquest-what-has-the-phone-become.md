My dreamquest: what has the "phone" become?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/05/nphone.jpg?resize=75%2C188)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/05/nphone.jpg?resize=75%2C188)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/05/nphone.jpg)  
*What is this?*

I experienced a very strange and perhaps illuminating dream last night. I’ve had an [HTC Evo 4G](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003N9B3CY/geneexpressio-20) since Christmas (for what it’s worth, **Sprint’s customer service has been horrible, but the phone itself is great**). Before that [I had phones with internet access](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dmobile&field-keywords=LG+sprint&x=0&y=0), but which were more primitive. At this point I probably can’t imagine what life was like *without* a phone like the Evo. That was evident in my dream.

Here’s what happened. Apparently I had left the phone in my pocket while doing laundry. This meant that it was damaged. For reasons which the dream-gods did not explain to me, as a replacement I received an old school gray Nokia of some sort, the likes of which I hadn’t encountered since the mid-2000s. Here’s the kicker, I looked at my replacement phone, and wondered out loud: “OK, so what am I supposed to do with this phone? All it can do is call people. I don’t even like calling people!”

Obviously I still refer to my phone as a phone. But at this point I don’t see its primary role as sending and receiving phone calls! (in fact, if I want more reliable voice I’ll probably go with Skype due to issues with reception) I am reminded of the origin of the term [‘stationery’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationery#History_of_stationery).
