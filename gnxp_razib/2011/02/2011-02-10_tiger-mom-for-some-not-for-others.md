Tiger mom for some, not for others

In a rumination on the “Tiger mom” phenomenon, [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/02/different_attit_1.html) suggests:

> …Back when I taught at Berkeley and it was considered the \#1 > statistics department, a lot of my tenured colleagues seemed to have > the attitude that their highest achievement in live was becoming a > Berkeley statistics professor. **Some of them spent decades doing > mediocre work**, but it didn’t seem to matter to them. After all, they > were Tenured at Berkeley.

That is an unfortunate, and frankly, scary side effect of the way meritocracy sometimes works. *Some* people **fixate more on the proxy measures than the underlying variable which it is intended to measure.** I immediately recall two close friends who were going to graduate school M.I.T. and Harvard at the same time, and by an unfortunate coincidence they made the *same* complaints about their advisors: that once these academics had reached their ultimate goal, they lost all sense of purpose, and simply decided to glide along after tenure. Status, not substantive contribution, turned out to be their ultimate motivation (one of my friends complained that his advisor had transformed himself into an extremely devoted family man after his reputation had reached its maximal value and there was no status return on labor investment!). No one could take away their positions as tenured faculty at M.I.T. and Harvard, and that was enough.

I think this is connected to this *Slate* piece, [Mary Gates and Karen Zuckerberg Weren’t Tiger Moms: Is the Amy Chua approach bad for the American economy?](http://www.slate.com/id/2284502/):

The scary thing about the “Tiger mom” idea is that it will spread among the intellectually gifted elite, and grind away the spirits of the innovation generators. A mechanical fixation on outcome and lack of deep understanding is actually probably better for the *average* future worker bee. By analogy, I do not have the mathematical talents to actually do original mathematics research, so someone like me sees math as a purely instrumental (or sometimes fun) enterprise. I use it. I learn it. I memorize and get comfortable with useful tricks and techniques. And that’s OK, because I’ll never see the forest. I lack the capacity.

People differ, and have varied strengths and weaknesses. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all “method.” Specialization is one way that aggregate economic productivity can rise. We should remember that.
