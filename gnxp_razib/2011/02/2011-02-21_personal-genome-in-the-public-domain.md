Personal genome in the public domain

[Manu Sporny](http://manu.sporny.org/2011/pd-genome-implications/) reflects on one week of being in the public domain in terms of personal genomics. I already pulled down his data, as has [Zack](http://www.harappadna.org/2011/02/project-update/). The whole post is fascinating, but this is really interesting: “I found out that it’s illegal to send any of your genetic material outside of Russia to have it analyzed.” In a related vein, seen Dr. Daniel MacArthur’s [When “Cautious” Means “Useless.”](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/when-cautious-means-useless/) I know that [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) is a for-profit business in it to make money for its backers, but there are certainly huge social spillover effects among my set in its bringing 500,000 to 1 million markers to the masses. It’s a clear concrete case of how innovation can result in positive gains across society. I am not a knee-jerk libertarian, **but your genetic data is *your* genetic data.** Own it, analyze it, and claim it!
