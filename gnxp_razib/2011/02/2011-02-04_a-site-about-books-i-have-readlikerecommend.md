A site about books I have read/like/recommend

Itâ€™s called [Razib on Books](http://razibkhanbooks.com/). I posted the [rationale over at *Discover Blogs*](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/02/razib-on-books/). Basically a way for me to organize past content which new readers are not aware of.
