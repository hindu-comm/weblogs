Guest posts @ Sepia Mutiny

Since it doesn’t show up in my [total content aggregator](http://www.razib.com/) ([RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed)), and I don’t know how to author filter Movable Type posts easily, I thought I would point to my guest posts over at the [Sepia Mutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/) weblog:

[Speaking of a demonstration in Pakistan….](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/006459.html)

[The decline of Hindi among American brown folk](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/006448.html)

[A civilization of regions](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/006439.html)

[Do that Guju you do!](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/006424.html)

[The undersampled 1 billion (genetically that is)](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/006422.html)

If you don’t know about the blog, here’s the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia_Mutiny). I’ve been commenting on that site since its inception in the summer of 2004, as two friends were co-founders.

**Addendum:** I push all the stuff in my [total content aggregator](http://www.razib.com/) to my [twitter account](twitter.com/razibkhan), [Gene Expression Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/GeneExpression) (though this includes GNXP.com posts *not* by me), and [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/razibkhan99). I’ve also got a [NetworkedBlogs](https://apps.facebook.com/blognetworks/blog/all_of_razibs_posts/) page which you can subscribe to or something. Probably other things I’ve forgotten about to be honest (e.g., here’s my [Talk Islam author page](http://talkislam.info/author/razib/). Don’t contribute there anymore). Also, I should mention that [Razib on Books](http://razibkhanbooks.com/) has its own domain, [razibkhanbooks.com](http://razibkhanbooks.com/). Everything posted there is pushed into the [total content aggregator](http://www.razib.com/), and the “posts” will usually be pointers to this weblog anyhow, but here’s the specific [feed](http://www.razib.com/books/feed/) if you care (someone inquired, so someone cares!).
