The New York Times flubs basic facts about Islam

Since 9/11, and even earlier back to the Iranian Revolution, Western journalists have served as oracles for the mass public, decrypting the ethnographic confusions of the Islamic world. There are many subtle shadings which no doubt can’t make into finite copy. **But I get really exasperated when extremely basic factual misinformation makes it into the pages of *The New York Times*.** I know, I shouldn’t, but it *is* the “paper of record.” It is made all the worse when the piece is an analysis which attempts to do more than report the straight facts, but rather place events in a broader context.[A Libyan Fight for Democracy, or a Civil War?](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/africa/22tripoli.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

> Even one religious leader associated with Sufism — a traditionally > pacifist sect something like the Islamic equivalent of the Quakers — > lamented his own tribe’s lack of guns for the fight.

Exactly *what* Sufi Islam is is a matter for doctoral theses. But I can assert with 100% surety that one could agree that in terms of *how* Sufi Islam is practiced in the real world it does not resemble a “pacifist sect” like the Quakers at all (there are similarities in terms of language used to describe Quaker and Sufi religious experience, but that sort of mysticism is very general, and not specific to just these two traditions). This is blatant misinformation, the kind of stuff you might hear in [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona#Vortices), but could be debunked with a very superficial understanding of the history of the Muslim world.

For example, the Safavid dynasty of Persia, which made Shia Islam synonymous with the Iranian nation in the 16th century, began as a [militant Sufi order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty#Background_.E2.80.93_The_Safavid_Sufi_Order). King [Idris of Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_of_Libya) was head of a an Islamic order which has been characterized as [Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi) and engaged in violent rebellion against Italian colonialism. And here’s an [article](http://tribune.com.pk/story/105628/are-sufis-essentially-non-violent/) which explicitly addresses the question of Sufi Islam’s purported pacifism:

> Mumtaz Qadri, the self-confessed killer of Salmaan Taseer, is said to > be associated with the Dawat-e-Islami, a non-violent, non-political, > Sufi-inspired group of the Barelvi school of thought.

Religious orders which have a militant side are pretty common across history, so this shouldn’t be a surprise. The Buddhist [warrior monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dhei) of Japan and the Christian [military orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order) are examples outside of Islam. Since 9/11 there has been a quest in the Western media to break Islam apart into “good” and “bad” dichotomies. So, Sufism = good. Salafism = bad. “Moderate Muslims” = good. “Fundamentalist Muslims” = bad. The necessity of this for the reading audience is obvious, but the reality is all too often all that occurs is that terms get invented, distorted, and reality bent out of shape to fit a particular narrative.
