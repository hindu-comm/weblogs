Genetic paternalists are very patronizing

An [comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/genetic-paternalism-the-f-d-a/comment-page-1/#comment-62252) below on my post [Genetic paternalism & the F.D.A.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/genetic-paternalism-the-f-d-a/):

Before entering into a presumptuous and patronizing lecture, it would have been nice to explicitly admit some conflict of interest here (some MDs arguing for control over this industry did in earlier comments). The IP originates from Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University. This is the internet. If you’re going to get stuffy and professorial you might want to use your real name.
