Personal genomics gets very personal

[Dan MacArthur](https://twitter.com/dgmacarthur) points me to this nice post over at [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/30/961626/-Our-Genome-Decoded:-How-Companies-Like-23andMe-Are-Advancing-the-Field-of-Personal-Genomics), [Our Genome Decoded: How Companies Like 23andMe Are Advancing the Field of Personal Genomics](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/30/961626/-Our-Genome-Decoded:-How-Companies-Like-23andMe-Are-Advancing-the-Field-of-Personal-Genomics):

One step at a time. I also appreciate that [Michelle keeps posting on her ADMIXTURE results](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com/2011/03/yet-another-admixture-post.html).
