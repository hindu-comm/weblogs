Mapping ADMIXTURE components

Over at [Harappa](http://www.harappadna.org/) Simranjit has been allowing Zack to post his isopleth maps of the frequencies of ADMIXTURE components by region. He now has his own blog, [The Jatt Gene](http://blog.jattdna.org/). On unrelated note, does anyone know of an easy way to generate isopleth maps which is open source?
