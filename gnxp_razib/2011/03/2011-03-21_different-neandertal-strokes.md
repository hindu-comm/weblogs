Different Neandertal strokes

John Hawks, [Europe and China have different Neandertal genes](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/europe-china-neandertal-comparisons-2011.html):

> This is very striking. China and Europe by and large have different > Neandertal-derived haplotypes. Haplotypes from Neandertals that are > common in Europe — say, with more than two or three copies — are > mostly rare in China. And vice-versa; haplotypes that are common in > CHB are rare in CEU. >
> Why should this be? Green and colleagues…hypothesized an early > population mixture of Africans and Neandertals in West Asia, before > that population dispersed throughout the rest of Eurasia. This > hypothesis was meant to explain why China and Europe have the same > proportion of Neandertal genes. >
> I think that is also consistent with the fact that China and Europe > have different Neandertal genes. If the population mixture was > followed by substantial genetic drift as the West Asian population > dispersed in different geographic directions, drift would randomly > increase the frequency of some haplotypes in one direction, others in > the other direction. Europe and China would end up with the same > proportion of Neandertal ancestry, but it would be distributed very > differently among loci. >
> **Next, we’ll examine whether this pattern is the same for the rest of > the chromosomes. Or maybe something even more interesting…**

Guesses? I’m assuming it has something to do with adaptation.
