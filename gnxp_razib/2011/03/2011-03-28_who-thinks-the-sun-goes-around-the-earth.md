Who thinks the sun goes around the earth?

My post [earlier today](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/the-republican-fluency-with-science/) prompted a few emails about the bizarre result that a substantial minority of Americans accept that the sun goes around the earth. The [General Social Science](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) variable is EARTHSUN, and it asks:

> Now, does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the > Earth?

The answers are “Earth around the Sun,” “Sun around the Earth,” and “Don’t Know.” A substantial minority of Americans answer \#2. What’s going on here? This isn’t something limited to America. The same question [has been asked internationally](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/append/c7/at07-10.pdf). I’ve underlined the geocentrism/heliocentrism question below:

I apologize for the small font. What you’re seeing though is that **substantial minorities, on the order of 1/7th to 2/5th of people in the regions above give the wrong answer on whether the earth goes around the sun, or vice versa.** Is geocentrism rampant? No, I don’t think so. My explanation is that many people don’t think scientifically *habitually*, so scientific facts aren’t background priors which pop up reflexively. On surveys which require a rapid first-blush reaction you may give the “intuitive” result, and only later realize that your answer was *of course* wrong. If you sat down and talked to most of the Americans who answered that the sun goes around the earth and showed them a solar system model and asked them about it I think they would be able to give the correct answer once properly *primed* in such a fashion.

Below is a side show generated from the GSS which measures reflexive geocentrism by demographic. I’ve combined the categories in the vocabulary test where N \< 100 with their adjacent values. Remember that it is on a 0 to 10 scale, and correlates [0.70 with general intelligence](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/). The educational category is broken down by the highest attained qualification.
