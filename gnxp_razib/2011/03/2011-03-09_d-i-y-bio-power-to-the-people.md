D.I.Y. bio, power to the people!

In light of [my last post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/your-genes-your-rights-fdas-jeffrey-shuren-not-a-fan/), I want to point to some groups attempting to create some “bottom-up” biological science in the real world. In the Los Angeles area you have [SoCal DIY Bio](http://www.socal-diybio.org/Main_Page), and in northern California you have [BioCurious](http://www.biocurious.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). And you also have the [DIYgenomics](http://www.diygenomics.org/) website. Apparently the [Gene Sequencer](http://www.socal-diybio.org/Gene_Sequencer) for the SoCal DIY Bio needs to be repaired, so I thought I’d pass word on. Unfortunately I do think it is possible that the government and interest groups can shut down direct-to-consumer genomics *business* in the United States by fiat. Business needs a legal institutional framework, so if that it is yanked away, it will whither and flee. **But it is a different matter when it comes to bottom-up ad hoc civil society.** Will the government threaten someone with fines and imprisonment for sequencing their own genome if they can get the resources privately? If so, this country is more screwed up than I would have thought….

Update: Also, [GenSpace](http://genspace.org/) and [Genorama](http://genomera.com/).
