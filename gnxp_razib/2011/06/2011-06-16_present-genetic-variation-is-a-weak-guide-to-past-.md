Present genetic variation is a weak guide to past genetic variation

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/588px-Bay_of_Bengal_map.jpg?resize=288%2C297)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/588px-Bay_of_Bengal_map.jpg?resize=288%2C297)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/588px-Bay_of_Bengal_map.jpg)As I’ve been harping on and on for the past few years that**the patterns of contemporary genetic variation are probably only weakly tied to past patterns of genetic variation** (though Henry Harpending warned me about this as far back as 2004). A major reason that scholars operated under this presupposition is the axiom that most of the variation we see around us crystallized during the Last Glacial Maximum (\~20 thousand years before the present).

This may be true in some cases, but I doubt it is true in most cases. I was pointed to a classic case of this problem just today. A reader alerted me to a short paper from this spring which attempts to ascertain the point of origin of the dominant mtDNA haplogroup among the Onge tribe of the Andaman Islanders, M31a1. This is an interesting issue because some researchers proposed, plausibly in the past, that these indigenous people in the Andaman Islands represent the descendants of the first wave “Out of Africa,” who took the rapid “beachcomber” path. Understanding the key to their genetics may then unlock the key to the “Out of Africa” event. Or so we thought. It looks like the human evolutionary past was a lot more complicated than we’d presumed.

The paper is in the *Journal of Genetics and Genomics*. [Mitochondrial DNA evidence supports northeast Indian origin of the aboriginal Andamanese in the Late Paleolithic](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1673852711000324):

Geologically unless the Andaman Islanders’ ancestors were accomplished open ocean travelers they almost certainly did arrive via Myanmar. The inference they’re making is based on the likely false axiom that mainland Southeast Asia has been genetically stable for the past 10 to 20 thousand years **. It hasn’t been genetically stable over the past [1,000 years!](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/06/language-genes-peoples-of-southeast-asia/)** The authors themselves offer up a good explanation for what’s going on here in the conclusion:

Bingo! At a minimum it seems likely that the Onge have been resident in the Andaman Islands for \~10 thousand years. Therefore we should be cautious I think about making too many inferences as to whether their ancestors were resident only in Mynamar, or spanned the South China Sea to the Indus, and so forth. But, I think we can grant that they arrived via Mynamar, and were once resident in Myanmar. The disjunction between mtDNA lineages in their rather large sample strongly implies that Myanmar has seen major demographic reshaping since the ancestors of the Andaman Islanders parted ways with their mainland kin. This stands to reason. It is almost certainly likely that Myanmar was dominated by populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages at some point in the past. These were replaced by the ancestors of the Burmans, Karen, etc. And to some extent even these have been displaced by newcomers, such as the Shan. **But the [Austro-Asiatic people themselves probably came from further east](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/sons-of-the-conquerers-the-story-of-india/).** If, and it’s a big if, the kin of the Andaman Islanders were the population which immediatedly predated the Austro-Asiatic groups, then there have been two linguistic shifts, likely accompanied by major genetic turnover. In fact I suspect there were probably more transitions in the past. I doubt hunter-gatherer populations were quite as static as we sometimes seem to posit, at least in the past 40 thousand years.

Here’s a table of haplogroup frequencies:

And here is how the branches of M31 are related to each other:[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/0.jpeg?resize=500%2C517)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/0.jpeg?resize=500%2C517)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/06/0.jpeg)

The Onge branch is distinct, as you might expect from an isolated island population. Using the molecular clock models they came up with a series of coalescences back to the last common ancestor (represented by the star in the figure above). I’ll quote them:

They’re right that their number is in rough alignment with the results from Reich et al. The Andaman Islanders diverged from “Ancestral South Indians” on the order of a few tens of thousands of years before the present. But I wonder as the value-add of their estimate when they have a interval over \~10 years on their expectation. That being said, it seems clear that this mtDNA estimate at least pegs a lower boundary. As cultural anthropology would tell us **the Andaman Islanders diverged from mainland South Asians well before agriculture.** And, the arrival of “Ancestral North Indians.”

On a final note, **if the Andaman Islanders arrived \~20 thousand years before the present from the South Asian mainland they don’t tell us very much about the “Out of Africa” people.** They’re not “living fossils,” and it was frankly somewhat stupid probably to think they would be. Until recently the “Out of Africa” event was pegged at \~50 thousand years, at its most recent. Even assuming this date the Andaman Islanders arrived in their present location closer to the present than the point at which their ancestors left Africa. But now there is more of a tendency to accept the possibility that the “Out of Africa” event wasn’t so cut & dried in any case, and may date as far back as \~100,000 years. If so we may simply have to acknowledge that fine-grained understanding of paleodemographics will always elude us if we can’t get our hands on a sample of ancient DNA. Even among pre-agricultural peoples there was probably too much population genetic turnover for the palimpsest to be teased apart with enough subtly to read the tea leaves of the past
