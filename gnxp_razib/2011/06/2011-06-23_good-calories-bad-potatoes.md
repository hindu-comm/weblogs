Good calories, bad potatoes?

[Changes in Diet and Lifestyle and Long-Term Weight Gain in Women and Men](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014296?query=featured_home):

I took the results when they controlled for other variables and filtered them all so that their p-values were 0.001 or less (in fact, of the ones below only “sweets and desserts” is p-value 0.001, all the others are below that). Nothing *too* surprising, but the magnitude of effect of french fries was pretty large:

I’m a big believer in not taking any given dietary study as gospel, and really doing a lot of personal self-experimentation in terms of your weight loss or gain. With those caveats in mind I think we can safely say that in the aggregate society would do a lot of good if we could decrease the consumption of soft-drinks and fries. That’s the “low hanging fruit.” I know many people who have given up soft-drinks, and it doesn’t seem like a change which is equivalent to going vegan or vegetarian, where back-sliding is very common.
