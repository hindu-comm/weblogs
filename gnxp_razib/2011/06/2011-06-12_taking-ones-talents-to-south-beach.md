Taking one's talents to South Beach

So It didn’t work out for LeBron this year. I suspect it *will* work in the near future. Remember that it took Shaq and Kobe four years to win their first championship. Talent doesn’t guarantee a championship, but it sure does increase the odds. For now though I’m savoring. Though perhaps not as much as the people in Cleveland.
