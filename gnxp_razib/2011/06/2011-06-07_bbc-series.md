BBC Series

The BBC have just finished a short (3-part) series of documentaries by Adam Curtis, under the general heading ‘All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace’. It’s impossible to describe them briefly, so I won’t try; suffice to say I found them fascinating but often exasperating with their wild leaps of logic. For GNXP readers the most interesting will probably be the last, which has a lot of material about W. D. Hamilton, George Price, and Dianne Fossey, as well as extraordinary archive footage from Central Africa. (I bet you never heard a BBC reporter casually referring to ‘jungle bunnies’ before.)

They are all available [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=All%20Watched%20Over%20by%20Machines%20of%20Loving%20Grace) for the next week, at least. Unfortunately I don’t know if this will be accessible outside the UK – some things are and some aren’t, usually for copyright reasons.

\[Added: if you can’t view it on the BBC iPlayer, the final part is currently available on YouTube – search YouTube for recent postings on ‘Adam Curtis’.\]
