Smart educated men less likely to think cheating always wrong

Lots of commentary below [on my post about extramarital sex](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/07/tolerance-of-extramarital-sex-by-sex/). I guess that’s fine, but I’m really not too interested your theories, I can do basic logic after introspection too. In fact, I can go down the street and ask a random person and I’m sure they could offer up after the fact rationales for the results I reported (people are always interested in sex and sharp about models to explain it). Instead, here’s the variable you need to use in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10): XMARSEX. I assume forms and graphical user interfaces worthy of 1997 are not too intimidating to readers of this weblog even if they perplex [Matt Yglesias](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/27/281183/are-empowered-women-driving-reduced-tolerance-of-extramarital-affairs/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29)?

In any case, here’s some more results. First, I wanted to double check that there was in fact decreased tolerance of extramarital sex over the years.Let’s break it down by sex:

Some of you were curious about the demographic correlates of this behavior. **Please note that *all* the following charts are limited to the year 2000 and later.** The sample sizes for XMARSEX were rather large, so I saw no reason not to make it relevant to contemporary attitudes.

Next, what are the sex differences in attitudes?

It looks me to that there’s a divergence among smart and educated individuals. WORDSUM 9 and 10 is the top 10% in the data set (WORDSUM has an [0.70 correlation with IQ](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/)). But that’s a small segment of the population. I did a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) where I picked categorical values which were ordinal (e.g., political ideology goes from most liberal to least on a six point scale). **After performing the analysis I will tell you that when you account for very powerful predictors like Biblical literalism there doesn’t seem to be much sex difference on this issue.** In other words it may be that the sex difference in the aggregate sample is largely a function of the demographic differences between males and females. But I don’t think this necessarily explains the gap at the very smart and educated segment, which are a small elite slice. Nevertheless this is the slice which is represented among pundits (in theory) and readers of this weblog.
