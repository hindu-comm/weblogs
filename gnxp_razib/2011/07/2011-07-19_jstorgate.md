[Feds Charge Activist As Hacker For Downloading Millions of Academic Articles](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/swartz-arrest/):

> Well-known coder and activist Aaron Swartz was arrested Tuesday, > charged with violating federal hacking laws for downloading millions > of academic articles from a subscription database service that MIT had > given him access to. If convicted, Swartz faces up to 35 years in > prison and a \$1 million fine. >
> Swartz, the 24-year-old executive director of Demand Progress, has a > history of downloading massive data sets, both to use in research and > to release public domain documents from behind paywalls. Swartz, who > was aware of the investigation, turned himself in Tuesday. >
> … >
> The grand jury indictment accuses Swartz of evading MIT’s attempts to > kick his laptop off the network while downloading more than four > million documents from JSTOR, a non-for-profit company that provides > searchable, digitized copies of academic journals. The scraping, which > took place from September 2010 to January 2011 via MIT’s network, was > invasive enough to bring down JSTOR’s servers on several occasions.
