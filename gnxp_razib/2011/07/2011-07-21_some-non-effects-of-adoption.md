Some non-effects of adoption

I mentioned offhand to [Trey of Genomes Are Us](http://www.personalgenomics.us/) that I’d look around for the effect of adoptive environments on criminality (what with the recent concern about studying the [genetics of criminal predisposition](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/arts/genetics-and-crime-at-institute-of-justice-conference.html?pagewanted=all)). Luckily I have [Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-on-ses-and-iq.html) in my RSS, as he posted something of interest just [yesterday](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-on-ses-and-iq.html), pointing me to this paper, [The environments of adopted and non-adopted youth: evidence on range restriction from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279339):

> Previous reviews of the literature have suggested that shared > environmental effects may be underestimated in adoption studies > because adopted individuals are exposed to a restricted range of > family environments.

The technical issue here is that there’s long been the assumption that because adoptive families are pre-screened they’re a selection-biased environment which won’t exhibit the same environmental variance as the general population. This matters potentially for behavior genetics studies which use adopted children, as it might underestimate shared environmental effect (a robust behavior genetic finding that puzzles many is that most of the environmental effect is non-shared). I’m not too focused on this specific issue, but rather want to pass along two charts which might interest readers:
