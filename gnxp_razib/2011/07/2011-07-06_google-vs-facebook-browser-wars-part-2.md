Google+ vs. Facebook: browser wars part 2?

There’s an amusing story up at [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/technology/06google.html?pagewanted=print) on the activity surrounding [Mark Zuckerberg’s](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/technology/06google.html?pagewanted=print) Google+ account. Zuckerberg is of course just scoping out the competition. Here’s the heartening part:

> So far, Google’s new social service has generated positive comments > from those with early access, in a turnabout from Google’s earlier > attempts to woo the masses with social services like Wave and Buzz, > which were met with lackluster responses and concerns over privacy. >
> Stephen Shankland, a writer for the technology news service CNet, said > that Circles, a feature that lets people sort their friends into > groups for more private sharing, was “the biggest improvement, far and > away, over Facebook.” Adam Pash, a blogger at Lifehacker, described > the service’s Hangout feature, which lets people video chat with as > many as 10 friends simultaneously, as “the best free video chat we’ve > seen.” >
> Even Tom Anderson, a co-founder of MySpace who was famous for being > every MySpace user’s first “friend,” weighed in on his Google+ page, > saying the service “does seem like it could take a bite out of > Twitter.” >
> … >
> **“We’re in the early days of making the Web more social, and there > are opportunities for innovation everywhere,”** said Jonny Thaw, a > spokesman for the company.

Remember the [“browser wars”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) of the late 1990s? To a great extent they were a media concoction. They gave rise both to “Netscape Time,” and the bloated piece of junk which was the [Netscape Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator) of 1998. And yet the competition did push innovation and create a better product for the consumer. This was clear in the early 2000s when Internet Explorer had a de facto monopoly, and the browser and the web went into a period of technological stagnation. The emergence of Firefox woke Microsoft from its slumber, though at this point it might never catch up on the non-mobile web. The newest version of IE is alright, but IE share of the market keeps declining.
