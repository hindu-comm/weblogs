Comments getting caught in spam

This occurs every now and then…legit comments without copious numbers of links get caught in the spam filter. Regular commenter [Michelle](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/crude-matter/) has had her comments tagged as spam twice since she’s changed her back-link URL to [Scientific American](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/crude-matter/). Today she tweeted me, and I noticed 4 other people who were also false-positived in the filter. To my knowledge **these were all people whose comments I’d approved before.** If your comment doesn’t show up after 24 hours (or immediately if you are a regular who has been approved already), please feel free to ping me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/razibkhan99), or email me at contactgnxp -at- gmail -dot- com. I apologize in advance for the inconvenience. There’s no way I can scan the spam manually, since there’s always thousands of fake-comments about how awesome my blog is in passable English to wade through. So make sure to tell me what your handle is.
