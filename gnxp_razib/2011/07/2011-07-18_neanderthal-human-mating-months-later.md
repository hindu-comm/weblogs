Neanderthal-human mating, months later….

Recently something popped up into my Google news feed in regards to “Neanderthal-human mating.” If you are a regular reader you know that I’m wild for this particular combination of the “wild thing.” But a quick perusal of the [press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-07/uom-grc071411.php) told me that this was a paper [I had already reviewed when it was published online in *January*](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/neandertal-admixture-revisiting-results-after-shaken-priors/). I even used the results in the paper to [confirm](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/neandertal-haplotype-in-the-family/) [Neanderthal admixture](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/02/my-familys-neandertal-genes-ii/) in my own family (we’ve all been genotyped). One of my siblings is in fact a [hemizygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity#Hemizygous) for the Neanderthal alleles on the locus in question! **I guess it shows the power of press releases upon the media.** I would offer up the explanation that this just shows that the more respectable press doesn’t want to touch papers which aren’t in print, but that’s not a good explanation when they are willing to hype up stuff which is presented at conferences at even an earlier stage.

A second aspect I noted is that except for [Ron Bailey](http://reason.com/blog/2011/07/18/your-grandmother-was-a-neander) at *Reason* all [the articles](https://news.google.com/news/story?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&ncl=dVRa_l5t0VnsnDMrgDmdYsx10YUgM) which use a color headshot use a brunette reconstruction, like the one here which is from the Smithsonian. But the most recent research (dating to 2007) seems to suggest that the [Neanderthals may have been highly depigmented](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5850/546.short). This shouldn’t be too surprising when one considers that they were resident in northern climes for hundreds of thousands of years.

But there are some new tidbits, from researchers in the field of study:

> “There is little doubt that this haplotype is present because of > mating with our ancestors and Neanderthals,” said Nick Patterson of > the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University. Patterson did not > participate in the latest research. He added, “This is a very nice > result, and further analysis may help determine more details.” >
> David Reich, a Harvard Medical School geneticist, added, “Dr. Labuda > and his colleagues were the first to identify a genetic variation in > non-Africans that was likely to have come from an archaic population. > This was done entirely without the Neanderthal genome sequence, but in > light of the Neanderthal sequence, it is now clear that they were > absolutely right!” >
> The modern human/Neanderthal combo likely benefitted our species, > enabling it to survive in harsh, cold regions that Neanderthals > previously had adapted to. >
> **“Variability is very important for long-term survival of a species,” > Labuda concluded. “Every addition to the genome can be enriching.”**

Since Nick comments here on occasion I probably should have asked him what he thought of these results back in January, but it goes to show that I’m not thinking like a journalist. Yet.
