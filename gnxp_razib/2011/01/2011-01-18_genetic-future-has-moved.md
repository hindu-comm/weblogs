Genetic Future has moved!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/biopic_geneticfuture.jpg?resize=100%2C100)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/biopic_geneticfuture.jpg?resize=100%2C100)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/biopic_geneticfuture.jpg)The day has come! [Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/geneticfuture) has finally gotten the stamp of approval from Tobias MacArthur, and [Genetic Future](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/geneticfuture) is over at [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/geneticfuture), with all their [other great science blogs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs). Since it can sometimes be a bit difficult to figure out where these diamonds-in-the-rough are in the bramble that is the *Wired* website, I recommend everyone switch to the new [new RSS](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/category/genetic-future/feed) pronto. Oh, and lest anyone wonder about *Wired*‘s beefing up of their predominantly white male lineup, Dr. MacArthur and I are [distant paternal kin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1a_(Y-DNA)#Distribution_of_R1a1a_.28R-M17_or_R-M198.29). I’m sure you can connect the dots on the appropriate syllogisms.
