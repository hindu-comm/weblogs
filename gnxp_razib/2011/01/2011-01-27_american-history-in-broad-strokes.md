American history in broad strokes

A comment below inquired about “good books” on American history. Unfortunately I don’t know as much about American history as I do about Roman or Chinese history. But over the years there have been several books which I find to have been *very* value-add in terms of understanding where we are now. In other words, these are works which operate with a broader theoretical framework, and aren’t just a telescope putting a spotlight on a sequence of facts.

– [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056//geneexpressio-20). I read this in 2004, and it was a page turner.

– [The Cousins’ Wars](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013708//geneexpressio-20). I had thought of Kevin Phillips as a political writer, but this was a very engaging and deep cultural history. My prejudice resulted in my not reading this until 2009.

– [What Hath God Wrought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195392434//geneexpressio-20). This book focuses on the resistance of the Whigs and Greater New England to the cultural ascendancy of the Democrats and their “big-tent” coalition which included most of the South, the Mid-Atlantic, and much of the “Lower North” (e.g., the “butternut” regions of the Midwest settled from the Border South).

– [The Rise of American Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393329216//geneexpressio-20). This is a good compliment to the previous book, in that it takes the “other side,” that of the Democrats. In many ways this is the heir to Arthur Schlesinger’s [Age of Jackson](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316773433//geneexpressio-20).

– [Throes of Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001IDZJ36//geneexpressio-20). A somewhat “chattier” book than the previous ones, it is still an informative read. It covers a period of history with the Civil War as its hinge, and so gives one the tail end of the [Age of Sectionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectionalism#United_States).

– [Freedom Just Around the Corner](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FVHJJE//geneexpressio-20). By the same author, but covering a period of history overlapping more with [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056//geneexpressio-20).

– [The Age of Lincoln](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809023857//geneexpressio-20). This is *not* a “Civil War book.” It is of broader scope, though since the the war is right in the middle of the period which the book covers it gets some treatment. I’d judge this the “easiest” read so far of the list.

– [Replenishing the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199297274//geneexpressio-20). This is about the Anglo world more generally, but it is nice to plug in America into a more general framework. North America is *not* *sui generis*.

– [The English Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465067573//geneexpressio-20). This is obviously not focused on America, but it is a nice complement to [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056//geneexpressio-20), as it shows the very deep roots of the division between two of America’s folkways. [The Cousins’ Wars](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013708//geneexpressio-20) serves as a bridge between the two, shifting as it does between both shores of the Atlantic.

I’m game for recommendations! I had a relatively traditional education in American history, and did very well in my advanced courses, but I knew very little before I read books like this.
