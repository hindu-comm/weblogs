The educated want more children than they have



The [post below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/a-college-degree-as-contraceptive/) is probably going to elicit a lot of comments. Some of it will repeat chestnuts of historical wisdom which illustrate the ignorance of the typical modern. For example, **it is false that the lower classes always have more children than the upper classes.** In general it is the reverse, because the lower orders are more squeezed on the Malthusian margins (this explains how downward social mobility worked in early modern Europe; the less successful children of the elites drifted down to replace the masses who were not replacing themselves).

In any case, Angela M. Cable [asks](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/a-college-degree-as-contraceptive/#comment-91834):

> Has it not occurred to anyone that perhaps the more educated a woman > is, the less she \*wants\* children. How do we know these women are > not child-free as opposed to child-less?

If I was Angela **I would go look for the literature on this.** I’m not one to ask questions imperiously without taking the time out to actually do some legwork. But I’m a peculiar beast. Let’s satisfy Ms. Cable’s curiosity, which probably remains unsated by any compulsion to find out the truth of the matter. The [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) has a variable which **asks the ideal number of children an individual would like to have.** Let’s replicate the analysis with that variable, and look at the difference between ideal and realized number of children.

[TABLE]

Some of the difference has to be the fact that more educated women have children later. So they’ll get closer to their “goal.” But I don’t think all of it is due to that. Interestingly the **variation in the ideal number of children is smaller than that of the realized number of children.** That suggests that the gap between educated and uneducated isn’t simply an ideological preference chasm.
