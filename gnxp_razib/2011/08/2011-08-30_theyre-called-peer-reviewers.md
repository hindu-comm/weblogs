They're called "peer reviewers"

George Monbiot’s piece, [Academic publishers make Murdoch look like a socialist](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist), is making the rounds. This paragraph jumped out at me:

> Murdoch pays his journalists and editors, and his companies generate > much of the content they use. But the academic publishers get their > articles, **their peer reviewing (vetting by other researchers) and > even much of their editing for free.** The material they publish was > commissioned and funded not by them but by us, through government > research grants and academic stipends. But to see it, we must pay > again, and through the nose

It reminded me of this scene from the *South Park* episode [Crack Baby Athletic Association](http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s15e05-crack-baby-athletic-association) (click):
