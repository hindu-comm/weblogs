Where is the ArXiv for X?

Derek Lowe asks [“Why Isn’t There an ArXiv For Chemistry?”](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/08/30/why_isnt_there_an_arxiv_for_chemistry.php) Where indeed. A few years ago I went to a talk given by [Michael Eisen](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/) and asked him about why the biological sciences didn’t have an ArXiv, and one of his explanations was that intellectual property was more of a concern in this area (e.g., pharmaceutical funded research). That sounds plausible enough to me. But the existence of ArXiv still should serve as a starting point for people outside of the physical and mathematical sciences in terms of the possibilities. Much of the discussion around [Joe Pickrell’s post ‘Why publish science in peer-reviewed journals?’](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) seemed to operate in a world where ArXiv didn’t exist. And it’s not just ArXiv, [SSRN](http://www.ssrn.com/) makes it easy to get papers in social science. We have the technology, and we see the possibilities. There are obstacles, but let’s not pretend as if we don’t have a model for some success.
