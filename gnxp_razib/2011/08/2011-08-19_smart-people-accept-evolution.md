Smart people accept evolution

At [Culture of Science](http://www.cultureofscience.com/2011/08/19/republicans-and-democrats-differ-on-evolution/) there’s a little discussion about whether acceptance of evolution indicates intelligence. Looking at the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) data there doesn’t seem to be a strong causal relationship **when you control for other variables.** But there is a correlation. That correlation can be explained by the fact that, for example, people who are Biblical literalists tend to be duller than those who are not, and Biblical literalists don’t accept evolution (in fact, I’ve seen evidence that very intelligence Biblical literalists are more Creationist than their duller co-religionists, probably because they’re more coherent in their beliefs).

With that, I’ll leave you with a screenshot of the results for [WORDSUM](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/), a 10 word vocabulary test, against acceptance or rejection of human evolution from other organisms (note that the numbers below the proportions are weighted sample sizes):

The real divergence is at the super high end of intelligence.
