An attempt at "open science"

I was asked by the person who provided me the Tutsi genotype for detailed results. **Of course I would do so!** So I uploaded the raw csv files to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B8Tdg8RZEWOOMWRkYTg4YzItODdjNi00ZjZkLTk2ZWUtNzAzNDg2OWI0YzZj&hl=en_US). The format and explanation isn’t totally clear, though if you follow my posts you’ll get it. This is for people who want more than pretty visualizations. But it did make me consider: **I do many ADMIXTURE and EIGENSOFT runs, and you only see a small minority.** This isn’t optimal for readers who want to dig deeper, but it also results in possible unconscious bias. So I’m going to try and do something different: I will post the raw results (at least in csv format) of all runs. But I obviously don’t want to cluster this weblog with updates, so you have to do one of two things to get notifications:

1\) Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/razibkhan)

2\) Add me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/109962494182694679780/posts)

At some point I might just start throwing stuff into a public folder, but that’s often so user unfriendly that only those “in the know” can decrypt what is what. My aim here is to resolve some confusions by posting all the results that I get to see. A lot of the discussion on online forums about my ADMIXTURE related postings are easy to answer if the people who are confused saw the full range of my results.
