Why Melanesians are blonde resolved?

Sort of and possible. I’ve been talking about this [for years](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/tag/blonde-melanesians/), and Greg Cochran points me to an abstract at the human genetics conference referenced earlier. [Novel coding variation at TYRP1 explains a large proportion of variance in the hair colour of Solomon Islanders](http://www.ichg2011.org/cgi-bin/ichg11s?abst=solomon&sort=ptimes&sbutton=Detail&absno=20258&sid=187977):

Australian Aboriginals are not present in the HGDP panel, so there is no clarity on blondism in those populations, or amongst other indigenous groups in Southeast Asia and Oceania. If these are deep ancient variants then this may span all these populations. If not, then you see independent occurrences of a phenotype which is only present in Europeans and European-derived/admixed populations elsewhere. Why? One hypothesis I’ve thrown out is that it is possible that **the expansive of agriculture populations erased a great deal of past human phenotypic diversity, due to the demographic growth of small initial founding groups \~5-10,000 years ago.**

The question mark in the title by the way is that just because we characterize the genomic architecture of a trait, we don’t understand *why* it is distributed in the way it is. Perhaps small populations resulted in more genetic drift in Oceania than elsewhere? Or there is selection on the *TYRP1* locus, and this trait is a side effect?
