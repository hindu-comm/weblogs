Around the Web – August 29th, 2011

[Thoughts on the BGI IQ study](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/2011/08/26/thoughts-on-the-bgi-iq-study/).

[Language Evolves in R, not Python: An apology](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/uncategorized/language-evolves-in-r-not-python-an-appology/3834/). Open science is good.

[Are Twin Studies “Pretty Much Useless”?](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/are_twin_studie.html) One interesting, but unsurprising, aspect of the response to execrable [Brian Palmer piece](http://www.slate.com/id/2301906/) is that several of us in the blogosphere pointed out pretty much the same set of well known findings to refute his weird charges. This isn’t rocket science.

[Romney vs. Perry: It’s personal](http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=797A2584-07CF-4A52-A5A1-5C856B183D11). ‘“I think he had a few exasperating experiences with Perry, and he’s not alone in that,” said one source close to Romney. “I think Mitt thinks Perry is not that bright.”’

  
[Genome-wide association study in individuals of South Asian ancestry identifies six new type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.921.html). Probably a good idea to study diabetes in the most numerous hper-diabetic population in the world.

[North Korea: The Long Coma](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/08/north-korea-the-long-coma.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+marginalrevolution%2Ffeed+%28Marginal+Revolution%29). I have said many a time that North Korea is the best modern representation of a pre-modern divine monarchy.

[Men Are From Mars, Women Like Kindles](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/08/26/305929/men-are-from-mars-women-like-kindles/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29). I think we need vouchers for males to close the “Kindle gap.”

[Working for GiveWell](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/25/working-for-givewell/). Holden is a very cool guy, for what it’s worth.

[Phylogenetic rate shifts in feeding time during the evolution of Homo](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/17/1107806108.short?rss=1). Bigger brains and smaller teeth?

[The Boundaries of Science](http://theamericanscene.com/2011/08/24/the-boundaries-of-science).

[Sex Ratio at Birth and Mortality Rates Are Negatively Related in Humans](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023792?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FEvolutionaryBiology+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Evolutionary+Biology%29).

[Will a Jurassic placental mammal make the molecular clock make sense?](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/variation/jurassic-placental-mammal-luo-2011.html) Looks like another win for some geneticists (Richard Dawkins alludes to this debate in [The Ancestor’s Tale](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/061861916X/geneexpressio-20) and basically predicted that fossils would probably show up at some point).

[Circumcise or Don’t? Quandary for Parents](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/health/23consumer.html?partner=rss&emc=rss). Be a [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability). Your own behavior pattern is a predictor for your son’s behavior patterns.

[As Farmers’ Markets Go Mainstream, Some Fear a Glut](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/us/21farmers.html?hpw). A “glut” is good for consumers. Were that there was an oil glut!

[There’s Room for More G.O.P. Candidates](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/theres-room-for-more-g-o-p-candidates/). I’d normally call bullshit, but Nate Silver warrants consideration.

[Mother’s BMI Linked to Fatter Babies](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110819131521.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29).

[Diverse microbes in Pygmy saliva](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/08/diverse-microbes-in-pygmy-saliva.html).

[Whole-genome sequencing of multiple Arabidopsis thaliana populations](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.911.html).

[The Righteous Mind](http://righteousmind.com/). I like Jonathan Haidt’s models, but they often strike as too superficially plausible.

[1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307265722/geneexpressio-20). Halfway through this book. **Buy it!** It is excellent.
