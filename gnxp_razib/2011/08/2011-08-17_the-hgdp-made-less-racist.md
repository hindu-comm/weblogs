The HGDP made less racist!

Back in the 1990s there was a lot of controversy around the [Human Genome Diversity Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Diversity_Project). In fact there were whole [books devoted to the *sociology* of the project](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521539870/geneexpressio-20). Though on some of the details critics of the project may have had a point, their overall aim of stalling scientific inquiry in this area failed in totality. A few years ago a team out of the University of Chicago even [produced a web browser](http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/HGDP/) so you can explore the data yourself. To my knowledge this hasn’t resulted in massive genocidal action against indigenous peoples; the human race doesn’t seem to need any scientific backing for that, alas.

But, if I was a Lefty the-man-is-racist type I think I might assert that the chips which were used to generate the 600,000 markers for the HGDP public data set are racist! I’m not one of those types, so what I really am concerned about is [ascertainment bias](http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Ascertainment_bias.html). From what I have heard many of the SNP chips floating around today are looking for variants **found in Europeans most often.** That’s because so many study populations in medical genetics are of European descent. This is not a total deal breaker, a lot of European variation is useful in understanding world wide patterns of variation. But ultimately it’s not optimal.

  
Today we take a major step in changing this. [Nick Patterson](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/science/12prof.html) sent me a nice heads up on a project out of David Reich’s [lab](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html). Using the full genomes of disparate human populations, as well as other primates, and archaic humans, the group has collaborated with Affymetrix to produce a panel which is much more finely tuned toward the concerns of those interested in the demographic and adaptive history of human populations.

You can find the [files here](ftp://ftp.cephb.fr/hgdp_supp10/), at <ftp://ftp.cephb.fr/hgdp_supp10/>. In particular see the [technical document](ftp://ftp.cephb.fr/hgdp_supp10/8_12_2011_Technical_Array_Design_Document.pdf). When I get some time I’ll be playing with this, rest assured.

Finally, Nick adds an important caution:

> We hope that this array, and the HGDP data we have produced will be a > major resource for population genetic studies. The data are > undoubtedly complicated, (13 different ascertainment schemes (!)) and > users should read the technical documentation, and especially the > short readme file. In particular note that the ancient DNA alleles are > not high quality (especially the Neandertal) and there are numerous > potential traps in analysis
