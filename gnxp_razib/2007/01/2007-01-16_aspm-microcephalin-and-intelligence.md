ASPM, Microcephalin, and intelligence

One of the papers [mentioned before](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/bruce-lahn-profile-in-science.php) on the lack of association between the derived haplotypes at ASPM and Microcephalin and intelligence is [now out](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/ddl487v1). Hereâ€™s the abstract:

> Recent studies have made great strides towards identifying putative > genetic events underlying the evolution of the human brain and its > emergent cognitive capacities. One of the most intriguing findings is > the recurrent identification of adaptive evolution in genes associated > with primary microcephaly, a developmental disorder characterized by > severe reduction in brain size and intelligence, reminiscent of the > early hominid condition. This has led to the hypothesis that the > adaptive evolution of these genes has contributed to the emergence of > modern human cognition. As with other candidate loci, however, this > hypothesis remains speculative due to the current lack of > methodologies for characterizing the evolutionary function of these > genes in humans. Two primary microcephaly genes, ASPM and > Microcephalin, have been implicated not only in the adaptive evolution > of the lineage leading to humans, but in ongoing selective sweeps in > modern humans as well. The presence of both the putatively adaptive > and neutral alleles at these loci provides a unique opportunity for > using normal trait variation within humans to test the hypothesis that > the recent selective sweeps are driven by an advantage in cognitive > abilities. Here, we report a large-scale association study between the > adaptive alleles of these genes and normal variation in several > measures of IQ. Five independent samples were used, totaling 2,393 > subjects, including both family-based and population-based datasets. > Our overall findings do not support a detectable association between > the recent adaptive evolution of either ASPM or Microcephalin and > changes in IQ. As we enter the post-genomic era, with the number of > candidate loci underlying human evolution growing rapidly, our > findings highlight the importance of direct experimental validation in > elucidating their evolutionary role in shaping the human phenotype.
