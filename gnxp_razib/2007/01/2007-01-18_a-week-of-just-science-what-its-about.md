A week of Just Science, what it’s about

[RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/01/the_week_of_science_challenge.php) and [Chris](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/01/week_of_science_challenge.php) have hit most of the points in regards to the [Just Science](http://www.justscience.net/) project. To be short, what **it’s not about** is anti-science. Just one week, that’s all. It certainly isn’t about traffic or comment response. It isn’t about ease of posting, expressing a clever opinion, but rather a tight exposition of a difficult concept. And it **isn’t about any one blogger, and it isn’t about you, it’s about science**. Myself, I don’t have the marginal time to spend writing one deep scientific post a day, so I’m putting things in the queue right now. I’m going to set up [Just Science](http://www.justscience.net/) as an aggregator weblog. In other words, for a week in early February the website will bring together scientific content from all the blogs who take up the challenge, and you can then use that feed to keep track of the posts.
