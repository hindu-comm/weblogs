I say inbreeding depression, you say heterosis

We’ve talked a lot about inbreeding and the its health consequences [many](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/11/heterozygosity-and-vigor.php) [many](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002755.html) [times](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/03/inbreeding-and-homozygosity.php) [before](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001063.html) ’round these parts. Most people think of the consequences in terms of unmasking recessive disorders like rare bith defects or the [inability to feel pain](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/freaks.php). But the consequences are also apparent in complex traits–a [new article](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/2/233) shows a negative correlation between heterozygosity in the genome (inbreeding causes decreased heterozygosity) and both blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

> These findings, if replicated, suggest that hR \[heterozygosity\] be > considered as a genetic risk factor in genetic epidemiological studies > on common disease traits. They are consistent with the well-known > effects of heterosis (hybrid vigour) described when outcrossing > animals and plants. Outbreeding resulting from urbanization and > migration from traditional population subgroups may be leading to > increasing hR and may have beneficial effects on a range of traits > associated with human health and disease. Other traits, such as age at > menarche, IQ and lifespan, which have been changing during the decades > of urbanization, may also have been influenced by demographic factors.
