Dendrite evolution

Trawling the net, I came across this chapter from the forthcoming 2nd edition of the Dendrites monograph: Phylogeny and Evolution of Dendrites by Gayle M. Wittenberg and Samuel S.-H. Wang ([pdf](http://synapse.princeton.edu/dendrites2_wittenberg_wang.pdf)). I was hoping to find something about the origin of dendrites and maybe something about differences in primates or humans. Unfortunately, there isn’t much to report. From reading this review, you’d get a definite impression that dendritic architecture is not the target of selection. The dendrites either don’t scale at all with brain size or they scale in such a manner as to preserve the “isoelectric” distance from the soma. In other words, even when dendrites grow, they preserve computation and communication to the soma. We get three leads to follow if we want to know about novel primate dendritic architectures:

We know a reasonable amount about [molecular determinants of dendritic branching](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?itool=AbstractPlus-def&PrId=3058&uid=15884008&db=pubmed&url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/neu.20142):

So it seems like maybe some molecular phylogeny could point us in the direction of good hypotheses. It would sure be nice to know when dendrites first arrived though. Does anyone know? Were cells excitable first or polar first (polar meaning having separate extremities with distinct function)? I assume it happened back in flatworms or something but I haven’t got a clue.
