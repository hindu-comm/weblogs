I don't smell it

Over at [Genetics and Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2007/01/15/is-liz-missing-the-genes-for-the-sense-of-smell/) Hsien-Hsien Lei [tells the tale of a friend](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2007/01/15/is-liz-missing-the-genes-for-the-sense-of-smell/) who can’t smell:

> The Anosmia Foundation says that approximately **two to five million > American adults** have disorders of taste and smell, which is a > serious problem because they’re not able to smell burning fires, > poisonous fumes, leaking gas, or spoiled food. Not being able to taste > or smell anything can lead to weight loss (especially in the elderly) > and even depression.

Just to show you what a freak I am, I immediately thought that perhaps these individuals would be greats controls to check and see if [their partner’s MHC profiles](http://www.lse.co.uk/ShowStory.asp?story=YT1032872P&news_headline=genes_means_opposites_attract_in_loving_couples) don’t exhibit the same patterns we see in the smelling population.
