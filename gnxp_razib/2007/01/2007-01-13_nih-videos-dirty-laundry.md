NIH videos – dirty laundry

I rediscovered the [NIH videocasting site](http://videocast.nih.gov/default.asp) last night. Looks like they finally made the transition to downloadable content.

This one promises to be interesting:

Issues and Approaches in Genome-Wide Association Mapping

Program date: Wednesday, December 13, 2006, 3:00:00 PM  
Presented by: Nancy J. Cox, Ph.D., University of Chicago Department of Medicine

Abstract:

TALK SUMMARY:  
I will air some of the “dirty laundry” in conducting genome-wide association studies with current platforms, and provide an overview of approaches that we have been developing in applying in GWA studies on type 2 diabetes. In addition, I will address some of the reasons that I believe GWA studies for complex phenotypes will be just as challenging as all other genetic studies of these phenotypes have been.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH:  
Nancy Cox is a quantitative human geneticist with a primary interest in the relationship between genotypes and complex phenotypes. Research in the lab focuses simultaneously on the development and extension of analytic approaches for identifying and characterizing genotype – phenotype relationships and on the application of those approaches to a variety of complex phenotypes including type 1 and type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes.

Their vast library is still only available in realmedia. Some good ones should be [David Amaral](http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?13139), [Michael Hasselmo](http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?12836), [Karel Svoboda](http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?11837), [Paul Glimcher](http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?11646), and [Gyorgy Buzsaki](http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?11630).
