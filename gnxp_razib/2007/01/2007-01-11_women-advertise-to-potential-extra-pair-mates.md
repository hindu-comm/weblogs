Women advertise to potential extra-pair mates

In an interesting paper published in the Jan, 2007 issue of Hormones and Behavior, researchers describe a phenomenon they claim is unique to human females; their overt display of fertilty. Specifically, around the time of maximum fertility, women show enhanced “self-grooming” behavior and dress in a more provacative manner in an apparent attempt to solicit copulations. Even more interesting, and in support of [a claim I have made previously](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/human-monogamy-is-farce.php), is that even females in long term “monogamous” relationships exhibit these behaviors. (difficult to imagine how or why behaviors like this would evolve under the humans are monogamous hypothesis)

I’ll just remind people that while the idea of unconscious regulation of overt behavior that enhances host reproductive opportunities, there are even cooler stories where [parasite infection effects sexual behavior](https://matt-at-berkeley.blogspot.com/2006/12/parasite-infection-increases-female.html) similarly.

While this is an intersting study, one might ask the following additional questions:

1.  Does the magnitude of solicitation depend on the quality of either
    the existing mate or extra pair mate? If this is an adaptive
    behavior, you would predict that solicitation should increase as
    existing partner quality decreases or as extra-pair mate quality
    increases. 2.  Is there a difference in male perception of this solicitation when
    looking acoss male quality or relationship status? 3.  Does solicitation vary with [MHC
    genes](https://matt-at-berkeley.blogspot.com/2006/12/partner-unfaithful-check-their-mhc.html)?
    (Do Women with rarer alleles solicit less?) 4.  How might one get a judge-jobs? “hot-woman photograph evaluator”

Any interest in replicating this here at GNXP? Women- submit randomly chosen photos to me or to Razib, one just after your period (low fertility), one about 2 weeks later (peak-fertility). We can assemble an “expert panel” of judges to evaluate …

Paper Abstract (and [doi](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.07.007))
