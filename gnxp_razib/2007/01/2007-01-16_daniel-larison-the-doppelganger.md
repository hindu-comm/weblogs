Daniel Larison & the Doppelganger

I started reading [Daniel Larison](http://larison.org/) because he is pretty clear headed about the Mitt Romney candidacy. But wow, I seem to have caught a blogger at his peak. I know whereof I speak, there is a time in one’s blogging “career” when the posts come fast and furious, unbidden, demanding release. The blog brooks no argument in regards to time or priority, there is no life, it is life. It seems that at the pace Larison is keeping he is at that stage, so enjoy it while it’s good, because the flower of youth always fades and the passion to speak abates as fires of cogitation withdraw to recoup. In any case, lots of interesting stuff, where else could you find someone who curses John Locke and the Enlightenment in one breath and backhands the Intelligent Design movement then next? Definitely an army of one.

On a different note, a few months ago I was in California at a burrito shop and I was face to face with someone behind the counter who looked just like me. Same height, same skin color, same short cropped hair, similar features, and get this, same cut and color of shirt! I could tell he was as unnerved as I, and even though I tried to be calm and eat I noticed that he kept looking my way in a really strange manner. I hope I never see him again….
