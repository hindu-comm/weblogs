Gavrilets’ models of homosexuality

[Sergey Gavrilets](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gavrila/Publications.htm) and William R. Rice have a new population genetic model for homosexuality out. You can [read the full paper](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gavrila/Publications.htm) over at Gavrilets’ website, while [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/1/12/6598c) and [Matt](https://matt-at-berkeley.blogspot.com/2007/01/homosexuality-is-not-all-that-common.html) both have some nice commentary. I don’t have much to add, and generally share Matt’s skepticism of the utility of a one locus model, but at least it is somewhere to start. I will reiterate that the “problem” is **obligate homosexuality**. I don’t find facultative homosexuality as surprising or evolutionarily mysterious. Also, I am intrigued by the the older brother effect because of its implications of genomic conflict.
