Home labs

[Coturnix](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/01/doityourself_biology.php) made me notice that you can [isolate DNA and run gels](http://makezine.com/07/) using legos and products from asian groceries. This got me thinking about what experiments I would run if I set this up. I think I could probably keep bugs of various sorts around and dissect out nervous systems. Could I select for certain traits in the right system? Could I discover anything new about biology in a DIY lab? There was a time when [Rita Levi-Montalcini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Levi-Montalcini) could make a huge contribution studying chicken embryos on a farm. What would you do with your home genetics lab? Are we at a point where the endeavor could only be a pastime or is there still something important to discover in our living room?
