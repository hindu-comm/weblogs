Race & modern genomics

[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/race-current-consensus.php) has an [interesting post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/race-current-consensus.php) where he explores some current findings about human population substructure. He begins:

> First, an important preliminary– there are millions of places in the > human genome where any two given people could possible differ, either > by a single base change, the addition of an entire chunk of DNA, the > inversion of a chunk of DNA, or whatever. Keep that in mind: millions > and millions of places (for a database of many of the single base > changes, see the HapMap). Now, the intuitive argument: after humans > arose in Africa, they dispered themselves throughout the world. By > both chance and in response to selection due to their new > environments, populations in different parts of the world ended up > with different frequencies of those millions of DNA variants. Simple > enough. Now, below the fold, I will present the evidence that 1. the > patterns of genetic variation form clusters on a world-wide scale, 2. > genetic clusters coincide with what is commonly called “race”, and 3. > genetic variation between clusters is relevant phenotypically.

Jason Rosenhouse [has](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/01/more_about_human_populations.php) [posted](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/01/some_questions_about_human_pop.php) on race recently as well. You can [find some of my own opinions on the topic here](http://www.scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/race.php). Ultimately, I think asking questions about race/population substructure is very interesting because I find human evolutionary genetics very interesting. 2 years ago Armand Leroi could plausibly say we didn’t know how skin color was genetically controlled. Today he wouldn’t be able to say that.
