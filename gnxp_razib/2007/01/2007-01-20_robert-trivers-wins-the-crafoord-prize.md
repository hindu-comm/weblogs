Robert Trivers wins the Crafoord Prize

A reader just informed me that [Bob Trivers](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16692479/) just [won](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16692479/) the [Crafoord Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crafoord_Prize) in bioscience! For those who would like to become more familiar with Trivers’ work, I highly recommend [Natural Selection and Social Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195130626/geneexpressio-20/). [Genes in Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674017137/geneexpressio-20/) is also a good read if you want some molecular level evolutionary exposition. Finally, Trivers looms large in both [Mother Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345408934/geneexpressio-20/) and [Defenders of the Truth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192862154/geneexpressio-20/). If you don’t know anyting about Trivers, I suggest this [Edge Special Event](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/trivers04/trivers04_index.html).  
Robert Trivers introduced concepts such as [reciprocal altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism) in the 1970s which revolutionized social theory, and serve as the atomic units upon which higher order explanations of animal (and human) behavior often build. In [Defenders of the Truth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192862154/geneexpressio-20/) Ullica Segerstrale chronicles how Trivers was in many ways the “mad genius” (literally, he has bipolar disorder) behind E.O. Wilson leading up the publication of [Sociobiology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674002350/geneexpressio-20). In many ways Trivers’ approach in evolutionary biology is that of a neoclassical economist, reductionistic, logical and couched in simplifying formalisms. Of course this has its draw backs, but, I believe it is an essential base on which other models and paradigms may be scaffolded.
