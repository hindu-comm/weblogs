Blondes are not sexier: What the theory predicts and the data say

[Steve](http://www.isteve.com/) has an interesting [post on assortative mating](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2007/01/anti-assortative-mating.html) in which he purports, in passing, that blondes have greater sex appeal, citing [Peter Frost’s hypothesis](http://www.vdare.com/sailer/050612_blondes.htm) that blonde hair was sexually selected in Northern Europeans (I’ll post on the assortative theme later). A danger in discussing which traits might be sexually selected is that the ponderer will likely go with what they personally find sexy and ask why such things might be sexually selected, rather than work from an independent angle. For example, I am very picky about the upper eyelids — if they have that half-moon shape, that really does it for me. I’ve heard [Michael](http://www.2blowhards.com/) say once that he likes this feature too — but then, we’re probably weirdos, or at least that’s the conclusion until someone can show that a large fraction of guys prefer this feature, and that there’s good reason to think it was sexually selected. Unlike half-moon eyes, blonde hair color receives lots of attention as a potentially sexually selected trait, but is a key prediction met — are blondes sexier?

Below the fold, I briefly review some theory but mostly present data from all winners in three beauty contests, which indicate no overrepresentation of blondes. I conclude that hair color is of weak importance at best in accounting for sexiness, that the role of sexual selection in accounting for hair color variation is also weak at best, and that the perception that men are more likely to find blondes sexy is due to a passing fad for blondes during the decade from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

First, Steve notes:

The idea again is that blonde hair is sexy in females, not males. But just as common as the above scenario is the guy whose feelings for his fair-haired maiden waver once he becomes enchanted by a woman with coal eyes and raven tresses. For instance, in The Hunchback of Notre Dame ([see here](http://www.bartleby.com/312/0804.html) starting at line 57), the once pure priest Frollo describes how, after watching the gypsy Esmeralda dance and sing, he became so bewitched that he could not stem the tide of lust rising within him and fell madly in love with her. Shakespeare’s [“Sonnet 147”](http://nfs.sparknotes.com/sonnets/sonnet_147.epl) expresses a similar predicament: the speaker’s got it bad for a bad girl! Not the first, nor the last. Interesting though literature and film may be, let’s get to the theory and data.

Starting with the predictions from theory, the hypothesis that icy climes select for greater sex appeal is probably wrong. [Gangestad & Buss (1993)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&q=cache:PIvvA-Jh1PEJ:mateolab.uchicago.edu/gangestad_buss_1993.pdf+gangestad+buss) showed that people in more pathogen-wracked areas emphasize “good looks” more strongly, and these are generally not icy areas. Think about the rest of the animal kingdom: where are the sexy, showy specimens with the most ornate song patterns? Same answer: mostly pathogen-infested areas, the tropics, etc. Consider the quintessential animal with exaggerated sexually selected traits — the peacock — whose rarer variant is native to Southeast Asia, and whose more common variant is native to the world’s germ-cauldron (South Asia). [Hamilton & Zuk’s (1982)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=7123238) explanation was that these traits signaled better health to mates, no small feat in such areas. So, the prediction is that sexual selection will be very weak in Northern Europe (defined as the non-Mediterranean countries), where blondeness reaches substantial frequencies.

But even if sexual selection were a strong pressure there, what independently motivated evidence is there that blondeness is sexy, so that males who are sexually selecting would choose it over brunette hair? Again, the only good guess people have made is that sexually selected traits signal lack of being parasitized. For hair, though, this has mostly to do with the texture, lustruousness, and so on, not color — although I’m willing to be corrected if someone knows of studies showing that blonde hair is more likely than dark hair to thwart the entry of pathogens into the scalp area. In any event, the main problem remains: in general, pathogen pressure is relatively very low in areas where blondeness is prevalent.

Turning now to the data, I recently [posted](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/western-ideals-of-beauty-look-to-south.php) about the list of who Maxim magazine ranked the hottest women for 2006, and there was no evidence of overrepresentation of blondes. The same is true for the other “lad mags” that you see in drug stores. Now I look at two other datasets that are probably more informative than who Maxim thought was hot in 2006: the winners of the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants. (The Miss America competition is not primarily a beauty pageant, as looks account for just 35% of the score). Such lists are preferable for testing the “sexy blonde” hypothesis since the individuals represent a very elite level of eminence. I looked up galleries of the winners, and if a girl’s hair color wasn’t clear from that, I did a Google image search for her. I judged overrepresentation based on the frequency of light hair according to Peter Frost’s map at the Wikipedia entry for [hair color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_color).

For [Miss Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Miss_Universe_winners) ([gallery](http://www.bellezavenezolana.net/MU/missuniversetitleholders.htm)), there are 56 data points: 12 (21.4%) have light hair, 43 (76.8%) have dark hair, and 1 (1.8%) is pretty in-between. Now, 21.4% is surely a greater fraction of blondes than there are worldwide, but remember that Miss Universe doesn’t represent the entire world — it’s mostly Europe and its offshoots, plus the white and mestizo populations of Latin America, and a tiny handful of East Asian countries (not China). For the non-Mediterranean areas of Europe, 21.4% is on the low-end of normal, but on the high end of normal for the Mediterranean (and so, for the mostly Mediterranean-looking Latin Americans who compete). I interpret this as supporting the null hypothesis of no effect of hair color on sexiness.

As for [Miss USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Miss_USA_winners) ([gallery](http://www.geocities.com/missusamagich/index.html)), there are 60 data points: 17 (28.3%) have light hair, 38 (63.3%) have dark hair, and 5 (8.4%) have borderline hair. Although the fraction is larger here, remember the US is much blonder than the Mediterranean and Latin American countries who are also big contenders in the Miss Universe competition. Because the vast majority of the US population has been Northern European since the pageant began in 1952, we should determine overrepresentation based on the Northern European areas of Peter Frost’s map. Doing so, we see that 28.3% is easily at expectation, and if anything is a bit on the low-end of normal for a predominantly Northern European population. Again, this result supports the null hypothesis.

In sum, we note that when put to a stringent test, blondes appear no sexier or uglier when compared to brunettes. Datasets such as Miss Universe and Miss USA are particularly instructive since the bar is set rather high. Then whence the perception that men find blonde  
s sexier? There is an interesting temporal wrinkle in the data — blonde winners are not evenly distributed in either dataset. For Miss Universe, from 1952 – 1974, 17.4% of the 23 winners are blonde; from 1975 – 1984, 60% of the 10 winners are blonde; and from 1985 – Present, either 8.7% or 13.0% of the 23 winners are blonde (depending on whether you are generous and code the 1 borderline girl as blonde). There thus appears to be a general lack of interest in blondes (and if anything, a dispreference for them), punctuated by a decade where blondes were very fashionable. Does the same pattern show up in the Miss USA dataset? Pretty much. From 1952 – 1973, 25% of the 24 winners were blonde; from 1974 – 1986, 50% of the 14 winners were blonde; and from 1986 – Present, 18.2% of the 22 winners were blonde. We note again the spike in blonde fashionableness from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

I suggest that those who came of age during this Blonde Decade — those who were born between roughly 1955 and 1970 — may have unwittingly projected their perception of the sexiness of blondes onto time periods for which the view is not true. Combine this with the theoretical problems noted earlier, and it seems likely that sexual selection’s role in increasing the frequency of blondeness is weak at best. That still doesn’t answer the question of why blondeness evolved — though I’ll leave that for another post (or someone else can take it up). The explanation that I (and others) find most convincing for now is based on Jerome Kagan’s work, starting in the mid-1980s, which has showed that light irises correlate with behavioral inhibition, suggesting that in Northern Europeans there was selection for different values of certain personality traits, which happened to also affect their eye & hair color.
