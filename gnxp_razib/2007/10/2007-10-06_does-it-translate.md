Does it translate?

So I’m reading Robert Fagles’ translation of [The Iliad](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140275363/geneexpressio-20/). Just curious, for those of you who know Greek and can read it, is there a major difference between the original and the translations? And more generally, for those of you fluent and literate in multiple languages do you see major issues with translating fiction and poetry?
