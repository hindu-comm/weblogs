Why you play the game

[Matt](http://blog.behavioralecology.net/2007/10/is-mhc-polymorphism-related-to-mating.html) finds some [unexpected data](http://blog.behavioralecology.net/2007/10/is-mhc-polymorphism-related-to-mating.html) regarding MHC polymorphism & mating systems. That’s the great thing about science: confusing or unexpected results can be a good thing! Science is in part about 3 1/2 yard runs which push the ball forward and extend the drive. But sometimes science is also about leaving the stadium and starting a new game. I have a friend who just stumbled onto results which might decide a central debate within his field, against the “side” he was on! But he’s happy about it, it might make his career, and he was probably wrong so it is all for the good.
