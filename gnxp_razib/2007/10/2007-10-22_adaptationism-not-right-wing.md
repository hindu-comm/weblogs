Adaptationism not right-wing!?!?

[An Empirical Examination of Adaptationists’ Attitudes Toward Politics and Science](https://tinyurl.com/23cofp). You can find a full [preprint](http://www.unm.edu/%7Egfmiller/new_papers/tybur%20miller%20inpress%20controversy.doc) at Geoffrey Miller’s site. The abstract:

> Critics of evolutionary psychology and sociobiology have advanced an > adaptationists-as-right-wing-conspirators (ARC) hypothesis, suggesting > that adaptationists use their research to support a right-wing > political agenda. We report the first quantitative test of the ARC > hypothesis based on an online survey of political and scientific > attitudes among 168 US psychology Ph.D. students, 31 of whom > self-identified as adaptationists and 137 others who identified with > another non-adaptationist meta-theory. **Results indicate that > adaptationists are much less politically conservative than typical US > citizens and no more politically conservative than non-adaptationist > graduate students.** Also, contrary to the > “adaptationists-as-pseudo-scientists” stereotype, adaptationists > endorse more rigorous, progressive, quantitative scientific methods in > the study of human behavior than non-adaptationists.

Some interesting points from the paper:

> **The two groups did not differ in sex ratio**, χ2 (2, N = 168) = > .406, p = .524 (adaptationists 64.5% female, non-adaptationists 70.4% > female) or age, t(164) = 1.16, p = .248 (adaptationist mean 26.97, > non-adaptationist mean 28.17).  
> …  
> …Reported p values were derived from two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests. > Zero of the 31 adaptationists and 13 of the 137 non-adaptationists > (11.2%) identified with the Republican party, p = .130. Two of the 31 > adaptationists (6.5%) and 21 of the 137 non-adaptationists (18.1%) > identified with Republicans or Libertarians, p = .256. **Neither test > revealed statistically significant group differences in party > identification.**
