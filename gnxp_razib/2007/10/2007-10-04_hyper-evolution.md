Hyper-evolution

[Evolution happens faster than originally assumed](http://media.www.mainecampus.com/media/storage/paper322/news/2007/10/04/News/Evolution.Happens.Faster.Than.Originally.Assumed-3013219.shtml):

The above was a press release from the University of Maine and so one assumes that the researcher doesn’t have such naive beliefs about the “rate of evolution,” as if it is subject to narrow constraints as opposed to being contingent upon the parameters (e.g., mutation rate, population size, strength of selection, correlation between genotype and phenotype, etc.). Why should it surprise that animals exposed toward the selective pressure of humans are subject to extremely rapid evolution? **Our cultural caprice moves at a quicksilver pace.** We also change the parameters of the game so as to facilitate evolution (e.g., increase population size and rev up selection coefficients, engage in selective inbreeding, and so on).

  
As it happens the researcher above has a paper out in *Molecular Ecology*, [Eco-evolutionary vs. habitat contributions to invasion in salmon: experimental evaluation in the wild](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03495.x):

Here’s a [digest summary](http://journalwatch.conservationmagazine.org/2007/10/04/evolution-in-the-fast-stream/). Humanity is going to have a major phylogenetic impact on the history of life on earth even if we quickly go extinct. Consider that we have introduced red deer to New Zealand, camels to Australia, reintroduced wild horses to North America and made nutria a feature of American southeast. These are just the larger and more charismatic fauna. Don’t even get me started on zebra mussles or thousands of “weeds.”
