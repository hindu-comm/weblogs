Is terror of new food genetic?

*The New York Times* has an interesting article, [Picky Eaters? They Get It From You](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/dining/10pick.html?pagewanted=print), which I’m sure many parents can relate to. Here’s the most critical part:

> The study, led by Dr. Lucy Cooke of the department of epidemiology and > public health at University College London, was published in the > American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in August. Dr. Cooke and others > in the field believe it is the first to use a standard scale to > investigate the contribution of genetics and environment to childhood > neophobia.  
> **According to the report, 78 percent is genetic and the other 22 > percent environmental.**  
> “People have really dismissed this as an idea because they have been > looking at the social associations between parents and their > children,” Dr. Cooke said. “I came from a position of not wanting to > blame parents.”

The original research, [Genetic and environmental influences on children’s food neophobia](http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/2/428), is a bit clearer:

> The results showed that neophobia is highly heritable. The > heritability estimate from model fitting was 0.78…A further 22% of the > variance was explained by nonshared environmental factors, with no > influence of shared environmental factors.

Note the word: heritable. [Heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritable) is the proportion of the variation of a trait (in this case, a psychological aversion to new foods) within a population that is due to the variation of genes (e.g., compare siblings, half siblings, twins, cousins, unrelated individuals, etc.). Basically it is suggesting that within the population whether you have a parent who was neophobic is a very good predictor for whether the child is neophobic.  
Another interesting finding here is that most of the non-genetic component of variation is nonshared, basically, that means that this isn’t about parents or home environment. Instead it is some other factor. This shouldn’t be that surprising, **one of the most consistent findings of behavior genetic research is that most of the non-genetic variation in personality does not seem to be attributable to shared environment** (generally it seems that half the variation is genetic and that most of the rest is nonshared environment with a small residual on the order of ten percent due to shared environment). [Judith Rich Harris](http://home.att.net/~xchar/) has made this finding the centerpiece of two books, [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20) and [No Two Alike](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393059480/geneexpressio-20/102-9239820-5488135), where she offers her own explanation of what the nonshared environment is and how it operates.  
Finally, I think it is important to bring up an obvious upstream variable to this finding: variation of taste perception, especially for bitter foods. The [genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001553.html) of his has been partly elucidated, and obviously genes are passed from parent to child, so food aversions reinforced or triggered by negative sensory responses will track heredity. There is [already data](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003665.html) that when there is genetic variation across generations that may result in friction between parent.¹ I doubt this explains all or most of the neophobia, but it is probably some of it.  
1 – If you imagine that bitter sensitivity is mongenic and there are two alleles of additive effect you may have a situation where one parent is a highly sensitive super-taster (homozygous) and another parent is a taste (heterozygous) and the offspring is a super-taster. If the parent who is a taster is the primary caregiver then you have a situation where there is a disjunction in terms of aversion to bitter tastes that emerges from the biology.
