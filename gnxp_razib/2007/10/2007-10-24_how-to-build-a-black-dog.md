How to build a black dog

[](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5783/62?HITS=10&sortspec=date&hits=10&maxtoshow=&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT&fulltext=mammoth&searchid=1&RESULTFORMAT=)I’ve mentioned [the emergence of the dog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/phenotype-to-genotype-as-easy-as-12310.php) as a model organism in genetics– the resources available now have made all sorts of questions easy (well, not easy, but comparatively easy) to answer. One such question: what makes certain breeds of dog black? The answer is now [available online at Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1147880): a small deletion in a gene called CDB103.

The gene is interesting because it encodes a novel ligand for MC1R, mutations in which cause red hair in humans (and lighter fur [in mammoths](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5783/62?HITS=10&sortspec=date&hits=10&maxtoshow=&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT&fulltext=mammoth&searchid=1&RESULTFORMAT=)). The melanocortin pathway seems to be polymorphic in all mammals studied, perhaps due to similar selective pressures on coat/hair color.

The authors have a neat picture of mice they turned black by inserting copies of the variant allele, which raises the question: can any dog breed be turned black? And if so, how much will people pay for it?
