Recent comments

Paul asked for recent comments. Look to the right. Just one note: that’s a Haloscan widget, I can’t fiddle around with the parameters or anything. Also, there are apparently [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) extensions which can give you a lot more control over Haloscan if you want. Just google it.
