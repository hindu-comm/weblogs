Chimp & human resting brain state

[A comparison of resting-state brain activity in humans and chimpanzees](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0705132104v1?rss=1):

> In humans, the wakeful resting condition is characterized by a default > mode of brain function involving high levels of activity within a > functionally connected network of brain regions…We find that, like > humans, chimpanzees show high levels of activity within default mode > areas, including medial prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. > **Chimpanzees differ from our human sample in showing higher levels of > activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lower levels of > activity in left-sided cortical areas involved in language and > conceptual processing in humans.** Our results raise the possibility > that the resting state of chimpanzees involves emotionally laden > episodic memory retrieval and some level of mental self-projection, > albeit in the absence of language and conceptual processing.

Any cognitive neuroscience people want to chip in?
