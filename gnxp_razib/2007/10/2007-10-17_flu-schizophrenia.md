Flu & schizophrenia

[Maternal Immune Activation Alters Fetal Brain Development through Interleukin-6](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/40/10695):

> **Schizophrenia and autism are thought to result from the interaction > between a susceptibility genotype and *environmental* risk factors.** > The offspring of women who experience infection while pregnant have an > increased risk for these disorders. Maternal immune activation (MIA) > in pregnant rodents produces offspring with abnormalities in behavior, > histology, and gene expression that are reminiscent of schizophrenia > and autism, making MIA a useful model of the disorders. However, the > mechanism by which MIA causes long-term behavioral deficits in the > offspring is unknown. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-6 > (IL-6) is critical for mediating the behavioral and transcriptional > changes in the offspring. A single maternal injection of IL-6 on day > 12.5 of mouse pregnancy causes prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent > inhibition (LI) deficits in the adult offspring. Moreover, > coadministration of an anti-IL-6 antibody in the poly(I:C) model of > MIA prevents the PPI, LI, and exploratory and social deficits caused > by poly(I:C) and normalizes the associated changes in gene expression > in the brains of adult offspring. Finally, MIA in IL-6 knock-out mice > does not result in several of the behavioral changes seen in the > offspring of wild-type mice after MIA. The identification of IL-6 as a > key intermediary should aid in the molecular dissection of the > pathways whereby MIA alters fetal brain development, which can shed > new light on the pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose to > schizophrenia and autism.

  
From [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071016090135.htm):

Many diseases which have environmental components of variation may actually be due in part to infections….
