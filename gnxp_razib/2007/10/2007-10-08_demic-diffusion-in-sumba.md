Demic diffusion in Sumba?

[Coevolution of languages and genes on the island of Sumba, eastern Indonesia](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0704451104v1?rss=1):

> …We examine linguistic and genetic variation in a contact zone on the > eastern Indonesian island of Sumba, where Neolithic Austronesian > farming communities settled and began interacting with aboriginal > foraging societies \~3,500 years ago. Phylogenetic reconstruction > based on a 200-word Swadesh list sampled from 29 localities supports > the hypothesis that Sumbanese languages derive from a single ancestral > Austronesian language. However, the proportion of cognates (words with > a common origin) traceable to Proto-Austronesian (PAn) varies among > language subgroups distributed across the island. Interestingly, a > positive correlation was found between the percentage of Y chromosome > lineages that derive from Austronesian (as opposed to aboriginal) > ancestors and the retention of PAn cognates. We also find a striking > correlation between the percentage of PAn cognates and geographic > distance from the site where many Sumbanese believe their ancestors > arrived on the island. These language-gene-geography correlations, > unprecedented at such a fine scale, imply that historical patterns of > social interaction between expanding farmers and resident > hunter-gatherers largely explain community-level language evolution on > Sumba….
