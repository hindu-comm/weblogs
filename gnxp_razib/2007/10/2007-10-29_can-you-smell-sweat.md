Can you smell sweat?

[Genetic Elucidation of Human Hyperosmia to Isovaleric Acid](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050284) (Open Access):

> Humans can accurately discern thousands of odors, yet there is > considerable inter-individual variation in the ability to detect > different odors, with individuals exhibiting low sensitivity > (hyposmia), high sensitivity (hyperosmia), or even “blindness” > (anosmia) to particular odors. Such differences are thought to stem > from genetic differences in olfactory receptor (OR) genes…which have > both functional and inactive alleles in the population…Here, we > provide evidence that a particular segregating OR gene is related to > sensitivity to a sweaty odorant, isovaleric acid. We show that > hypersensitivity towards this odorant is seen predominantly in > individuals who carry at least one copy of the intact allele. > Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hyperosmia is a complex trait, > being driven by additional factors affecting general olfactory acuity. > Our results highlight a functional role of segregating pseudogenes in > human olfactory variability, and constitute a step towards deciphering > the genetic basis of human olfactory variability.

PLoS also has a [nice write up](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0050298) for the lay audience, with a more frank title.
