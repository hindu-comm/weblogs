Inter-species monkey lovin'

From [an article](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/176/4/2421) in Genetics:

The fact that the species (two species of howler monkey) diverged about 3 million years ago is pretty striking– the divergence time of humans and chimps is “only” one or two million years more than that, but creating a [humanzee](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/history/king_kong_soviet_humanzee_2005.html) doesn’t seem to be possible. Humans and Neandertals, though, only split a few hundred thousand years ago.
