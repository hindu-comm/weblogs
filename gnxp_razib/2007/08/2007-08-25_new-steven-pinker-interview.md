New Steven Pinker interview

Check out this [new interview](http://www.cosmoetica.com/DSI4.htm) with Steven Pinker. It ostensibly focuses on his new book, [The Stuff of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063274/geneexpressio-20/), though it covers a lot of ground. My own feeling is that the interviewer should have let the focus be more on Pinker than his own pet theories, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there.
