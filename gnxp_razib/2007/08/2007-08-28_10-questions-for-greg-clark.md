10 questions for Greg Clark

Over at my other blog Herrick posts a response to [10 questions for Gregory Clark](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/08/10-questions-for-greg-clark.php). Clark is an economic historian whose most recent book [Farwell to Alms](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691121354/geneexpressio-20/) is making a splash. I read the book recently, but because I’m not well versed in economics I’ve held off saying much. I will add that Clark’s point that the typical humans of 1800 were poorer and less well off than those of 10,000 BCE is an important insight, and it is born out by decades of analysis of remains which show that farmers are on average underfed and nutrient deprived vis-a-vis hunter-gatherers.
