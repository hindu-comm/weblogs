Redheads going extinct hoax

Just wanted put a note here that I have two posts, [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/08/update_on_redhead_hoax.php) and [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/08/red_hair_going_extinct.php) about a new incarnation of the “redheads are going to go extinct” meme. The current culprit is *National Geographic Magazine*. The only reason that I know about this is that there was a spike of traffic from message boards on my other blog attempting to debunk the story using some stuff I’d posted earlier.
