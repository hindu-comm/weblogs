Mating minds?

The Economist has [a review](http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9581656) of a paper [briefly mentioned](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/07/quick-links.php) here on “conspicuous altruism” and signaling. It’s a good account of the research, but I feel like some of the ideas are getting mixed up. The Economist sums up Geoff Miller’s “mating mind” theory thusly:

> Dr Miller, who works at the University of New Mexico, thinks that > mental processes which are uniquely human, such as language and the > ability to make complicated artefacts, evolved originally for sexual > display.

The experiments then described don’t really have much to do with that theory, as far as I can tell. Here’s the summary of the results:

> The sexes do, indeed, have different strategies for showing off. > Moreover, they do not waste their resources by behaving like that all > the time. Only when it counts sexually are men profligate and women > helpful…Romantically primed men wanted to buy items that they could > wear or drive, rather than things to be kept at home. Their motive, > therefore, was not mere acquisitiveness. Similarly, romantically > primed women volunteered for activities such as working in a shelter > for the homeless, rather than spending an afternoon alone picking up > rubbish in a park. For both sexes, however, those in an unromantic > mood were indifferent to the public visibility of their choices.

This is an interesting result, but what does it have to do with the evolution of language or “human-ness”?
