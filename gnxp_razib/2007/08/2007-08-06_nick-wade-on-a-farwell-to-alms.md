Nick Wade on A Farwell to Alms

Nick Wade of *The New York Times* has an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/science/07indu.html?8dpc=&pagewanted=all) up on Greg Clark’s [A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691121354/geneexpressio-20/). I haven’t gotten to Clark’s book because I’ve set myself the goal of reading Hal Varian’s [Intermediate Microeconomics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393927024//geneexpressio-20/) (halfway through) before I touch another pop or historical econ book, but I’ll get to it (population genetics textbooks are are good prep for microeconomics!). I’m cautiously skeptical, though I think Clark’s ambitious but heterodox ideas are a good thing (ambitious but orthodox I am less interested in).
