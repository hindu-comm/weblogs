Parallels

Pardon the interruption, but if anyone has successfully used Parallels with a Windows XP partition in Boot Camp that is FAT 32 configured would you please drop a line (clicking the name “amnestic” above will result in a pop-up window with a contact box)? I have been combing through the knowledge bases, blog entries, and forums for a couple days and I am still stuck with “Unable to open disk image Boot Camp!” Frustration mounts.
