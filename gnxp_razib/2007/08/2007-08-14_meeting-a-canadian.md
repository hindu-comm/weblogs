Meeting a Canadian

In a line.  
Guy in front of me: Line’s long, hey?  
Me: You Canadian?  
Guy in front of me: \[surprised look\] What! How’d you know? How could you tell.  
Me: Well, you said “hey” in your first three words. I thought you were either joking and pretending to be Canadian for laughs, or actually Canadian.  
Guy in front of me: I didn’t even know I said “hey.”  
Me: Canadians are funny. Canada is funny.  
Guy in front of me: We’re a much bigger country than you.  
Me: But you have a smaller population than California. And you’re always frozen.  
Guy in front me: \[nervous laugh\] Well, that’s pretty much right, hey? \[shrug\]
