Taxis

This morning in NYC I took a cab to Penn Station. It was raining really hard…so I was curious, I asked the cab driver, “So do you get more fares when it’s raining?” He explained that yes, there are more fares on hand, but because of the rain and traffic jams it works out to less revenue in a given day (e.g., he explained that half the time he’s stuck in traffic without a fare).  
Then I showed up in D.C. this afternoon, and I notice no meter or even all that offical crap that NYC cabs have. I start freaking out and wondering whether this is really a cab, but the guy drops me off and asks for a reasonable amount. Later I find out that D.C. has some “zones,” instead of metered service. Strange.
