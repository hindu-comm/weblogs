Some Small World

1 hour after I landed in NYC from the land of green trees and the Pacific I had to explain to another visitor that the E train could take him to Penn Station, that you could recognize it by the colored label affixed to the front and the sides. And yes, they would announce it when they arrived at Penn Station (and you could actually look out the window and note that it wasnâ€™t a typical stop by the bustle). My fellow stranger was from a state called New Jersey. Strange, eh?
