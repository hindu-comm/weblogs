Flip that switch!

Yes, yes, I know people aren’t mice. But check out [this piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/magazine/05autism-t.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=magazine&pagewanted=all) on female autistics in *The New York Times Magazine*. Here’s an interesting part:

I have offered the conjecture [before](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/09/why_patriarchy.php) that a lot of the social phenomena we see around us has to be filtered through the reality that **men and women socialize very differently**. Roughly, I believe that male socialization norms are more coarse, inflexible and girded by clear heuristics. In contrast, I think female social networks are more natural and leverage innate abilities of women to read faces, manner and engage in extreme [intentionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionality#Overview). I believe this is one reason that patriarchy emerges in mass societies: though more coarse and less informative, I believe that simpler male interaction dynamics scale much more easily than the way women operate in groups. It naturally makes sense that high IQ autistic males could “fake it” or “get by” much more easily than high IQ autistic females, the male social system is much more clumsy and probably requires less innate cognitive skill.

Addendum: An example by analogy. A typical human has lighting fast numeracy perception. For example, compare someone who “recognizes” a set of objects from the 1 to 4 in quantity vs. someone counting 1, 2, 3, 4. Obviously the latter method is relatively slow and depends on a lot more cognitive scaffolding (various aspects of human intelligence). Gestalt recognition on the other hand is fast and almost unconscious. But now imagine the number of objects increasing. Soon you really don’t have a good sense of numbers via innate numeracy, you can recognize proportions, but you can’t recognize 73 objects. On the other hand, though counting is slow, and continues to take more time as the number of objects increases, but it scales so that you can feasible continue to count an increasing number so long as you’re willing to put more time in it.
