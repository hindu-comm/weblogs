Superbad is somewhat good

![superbad.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/08/superbad.jpg?resize=325%2C483)![superbad.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/08/superbad.jpg?resize=325%2C483)Went to see Superbad with [Jake](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/), [Kara](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/) & [Jason Rosenhouse](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/). I thought it was OK, only checked time once. But again, the pairing of [fug](https://imdb.com/name/nm1706767/) dudes with [un-fug](https://imdb.com/name/nm1297015/) chicks leaves me unsuspended in my disbelief.
