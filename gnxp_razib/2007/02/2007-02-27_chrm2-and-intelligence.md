CHRM2 and Intelligence

[CHRM2 Gene Variants Associated with Intelligence](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-02/wuso-gag022607.php)

> “Some of the participants in the study also took the Wechsler Adult  
> Intelligence Scale-Revised, a traditional IQ test. In all, members of > 200  
> families, including more than 2,150 individuals, took the Wechsler > test, and those results were matched to differences in individuals’ > DNA. >
> By comparing individual differences embedded in DNA, the team zeroed > in on CHRM2, the neuronal receptor gene on chromosome 7. The CHRM2 > gene activates multitude of signaling pathways in the brain involved > in learning, memory and other higher brain functions. The research > team doesn’t yet understand how the gene exerts its effects on > intelligence.”  
> …  
> Dick’s team is not the first to notice a link between intelligence and > the CHRM2 gene. In 2003, a group in Minnesota looked at a single > marker in the gene and noted that the variation was related to an > increase in IQ. A more recent Dutch study looked at three regions of > DNA along the gene and also noticed influences on intelligence. In > this new study, however, researchers tested multiple genetic markers > throughout the gene. >
> “If we look at a single marker, a DNA variation might influence IQ > scores between two and four points, depending on which variant a > person carries,” Dick explains. “We did that all up and down the gene > and found that the variations had cumulative effects, so that if one > person had all of the ‘good’ variations and another all of the ‘bad’ > variations, the difference in IQ might be 15 to 20 points. > Unfortunately, the numbers of people at those extremes were so small > that the finding isn’t statistically significant, but the point is we > saw fairly substantial differences in our sample when we combined > information across multiple regions of the gene.” >
> Dick says the next step is to look at the gene and its numerous > variants to learn what is going on biologically that might affect > cognitive performance. Presently, she says it’s too early to predict > how small changes in the gene might be influencing communication in > the brain to affect intelligence, and she says it’s nearly certain > CHRM2 is not the only gene involved.
