Human biodiversity @ SI

Readers interested in the [range of human phenotypic variation](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/2007_swimsuit/models/) will be interested in inspecting the new *SI* model index. In particular, some readers might find the [Brazil models gallery](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/2007_swimsuit/models/brazil/07_brazil_1.html) of particular interest.
