New blog posts

As a make-up for having hardly any time to post during the Week of Science, I have just added a set of four posts of pure science to [my blog](https://scitheory.blogspot.com) in rapid succession. On is on something that was already mentioned here, but the others are unrelated to anything on GNXP, so if you want to check them out, you can read them.
