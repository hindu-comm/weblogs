Epigenetics: the hippest field on the block

The [current issue of Cell](http://www.cell.com/content/issue?volume=128&issue=4) is dedicated to the rapidly changing field of epigenetics, loosely defined at the ensemble of chromatin and DNA modifications that structure the genome and control gene expression. The only review I’ve worked my way through yet is this one: [Timescales of Genetic and Epigenetic Inheritance](http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867407001213).

The authors limit themselves largely to bacteria and yeast, but they document a great deal of evidence that parameters like the mutation rate change in response to external stimuli, perhaps in almost a “directed” fashion. [Some work in primates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15946765&dopt=Citation) has shown a correlation between the amount of mutation raining down on a population and the amount of beneficial mutations that arise. Could “directed” mutagenesis be an explanation for this?

The main points from the paper are summarized in the figure below; essentially, epigenetic inheritance is a way for a population to respond to environmental changes that occur on time scales shorter than those needed for genetic evolution.
