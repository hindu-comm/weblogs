Just Science Wrap Up

[A Week of Just Science](http://www.justscience.net/) just finished up, and to all those who participated, I say bravo! The stipulation to post only science and at least one item of meaty substance per day was straining for many of us, and life intervenes and not everyone could hit their quota. But that’s fine, the point wasn’t to hit some magical number or achieve a quantitative threshhold of posts. Rather, we wanted to **ask** what we asked and see how people responded, and I was personally rather pleased.  
The [Just Science](http://www.justscience.net/) website will be “frozen” for the next year, until next February when the aggregator will fire up again. This is important, because if **you didn’t get to read as many posts as you wanted, never fear, they’ll be there for the next 12 months!** Myself, I’ve bookmarked quite a bit and plan to read a lot of the physical science posts since it’s been a while since I’ve focused on this area. The search box and the category links on the sidebar should be helpful.  
Finally, I want to give a should out to my homies @ [GNXP Classic](http://gnxp.com/). I drafted them into this project without their input, and they stepped up without any complaints. Here are the posts they generated this week:
