Blood of the Isles

Since there was some talk about Saxons & Celts in posts below, I thought it would be worthwhile to reproduce some data from [Saxons, Vikings and Celts](https://www.amazon.com/Saxons-Vikings-Celts-Genetic-Britain/dp/0393062686/sr=1-1/qid=1170572402/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-4902002-8438067?ie=UTF8&s=books), Bryan Sykes’ new survey of British archeogenetics. The table below is of male lineages only, but it gives a general sense of the overlay of various demographic movements over British history. Don’t put too much weight in specific proportions, rather, focus on the relationships between them. No matter the extact percentage of “Anglo-Saxon” which emerges out of any given survey, it is almost certain that East Anglia will exhibit the modal value and other regions of England and Wales will have decreasing proportions as a function of distance….
