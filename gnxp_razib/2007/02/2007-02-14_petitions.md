Petitions

Dear [Henry Farrell](http://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=200),

Like many others of your ideological inclinations, you make much of the recent petition in favor of raising the minimum wage which was signed by [over 650 economists](http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/minwagestmt2006). I will [see you and raise you](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=2732&program=News&callingPage=discoMainPage).

Careful where you point that thing, it’s [loaded](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/12/can_600_economi.html).

Regards,  
Matt
