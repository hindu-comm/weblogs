Race IQ and SES

Jensen (1998) makes a point that is worth repeating:

> The pernicious notion that IQ discriminates mainly along racial lines, > however, is utterly false.

Jensen presents what should be a predictable pattern for a highly heritable trait:

Source % of Variance Average IQ Difference

|                                                 |     |     |     | |-------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----| |                                                 |     |     |     | | Between races (within social classes)           | 14  | 30  | 12  | | Between social classes (within races)           | 8   |     | 6   | | Interaction of race and social class            | 8   |     |     | | Between families (within race and social class) | 26  | 65  | 9   | | Within families (siblings)                      | 39  |     | 11  | | Measurement error                               | 5   |     | 4   | | Total                                           | 100 |     | 17  |

> This can be demonstrated most clearly in terms of a statistical method > known as the analysis of variance. Table 11.1 shows this kind of > analysis for IQ data obtained from equal-sized random samples of black > and white children in California schools. Their parentsâ€™ social class > (based on education and occupation) was rated on a ten-point scale. In > the first column in Table 11.1 the total variance of the entire data > set is of course 100 percent and the percentage of total variance > attributable to each of the sources6 is then listed in the first > column. We see that only 30 percent of the total variance is > associated with differences between race and social class, whereas 65 > percent of the true-score variance is completely unrelated to IQ > differences between the races and social classes, and exists entirely > within each racial and social class group. The single largest source > of IQ variance in the whole population exists within families, that > is, between full siblings reared together in the same family. The > second largest source of variance exists between families of the same > race and the same social class. The last column of Table 11.1 shows > what happens when each of the variances in the first column is > transformed into the average IQ difference among members of the given > classification. For example, the average difference between blacks and > whites of the same social class is 12 IQ points. The average > difference between full siblings (reared together) is 11 IQ points. > Measurement error (i.e., the average difference between the same > person tested on two occasions) is 4 IQ points. (By comparison, the > average difference between persons picked at random from the total > population is 17 IQ points.) Persons of different social class but of > the same race differ, on average, only 6 points, more or less, > depending on how far apart they are on the scale of socioeconomic > status (SES). What is termed the interaction of race and social class > (8 percent of the variance) results from the unequal IQ differences > between blacks and whites across the Spectrum of SES, as shown in > Figure 11.2. This interaction is a general finding in other studies as > well. Typically, IQ in the black population is not as differentiated > by SES as in the white population, and the size of the mean W-B > difference increases with the level of SES.
