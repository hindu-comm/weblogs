A request for bloggingheads.tv – Larison vs. Yglesias

Most of you know I’m not very into politics…but I do have two political weblogs in my RSS which pound it hard, [Matt Yglesias](http://matthewyglesias.com/) on the “Left” and [Daniel Larison](http://larison.org/) on the “Right.”¹ I humbly request that Robert Wright have these two face off on [Blogging Heads](http://bloggingheads.tv/), just to see if English will allow them to communicate in any intelligible manner (please note, Ross Douthat over at [The American Scene](http://theamericanscene.com/) reads and is read by both, so there is only one degree of separation).  
1 – Quotations are for two reasons…Matt Yglesias has sometimes stated that he wishes he lived in Europe…so he could be a *European* liberal (as opposed to Social Democrat). So his liberalism is really a function of the current political landscape. Larison is so reactionary that he really transcends being boxed in as “right-wing.”
