Academic Blogs directory

I noticed a post at [Crooked Timber](http://crookedtimber.org/) about something called [The Academic Blog Portal](http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). Itâ€™s a wiki. Both Gene Expressions are listed in the [biology section](http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Biology). It is interesting to compare the representation of different disciplines, there are, for example, more [linguistics and philosophy](http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Linguistics_and_Philosophy) blogs than biology blogs, but also, more [history blogs](http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/History). Not all fields are represented to their proportion in academia, for example, only [4 engineering blogs](http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Engineering).
