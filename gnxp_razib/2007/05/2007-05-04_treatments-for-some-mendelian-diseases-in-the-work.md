Treatments for some Mendelian diseases in the works?

One of the most consistent complaints about medical genetics research is that it’s great at finding the gene/genes underlying a disease, but finding the gene/genes doesn’t necessarily lead to any sort of treatment. The genes for [cystic fibrosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=219700) and [Duchenne muscular dystrophy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=310200), for example, were both identified in the late ’80s. Both remain uncured. In fact, the genes underlying a large number of so-called “Mendelian” diseases (named because they are essentually due to defects in a single gene, unlike “complex” or “multifactorial” diseases) were identified in a mad rush after the realization [in 1980](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=6247908) that disease genes could be found without knowing anything *a priori* about a disease or its genetics. As far as I know, no treatments have come out of these studies.

But as they say, Rome was not built in a day. If the precise genetic defect underlying a disease can be indentified, someone will find a way to fix it, though it may take many years, new technologies, and a lot of luck. So it’s heartening to see [a report](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7140/abs/nature05756.html) in this week’s Nature on the identification of a compound that may one day be a treatment for disorders caused by nonsense mutations (mutations that cause a truncated protein). From the abstract:

> Nonsense mutations promote premature translational termination and > **cause anywhere from 5-70% of the individual cases of most inherited > diseases**. Studies on nonsense-mediated cystic fibrosis have > indicated that boosting specific protein synthesis from >
