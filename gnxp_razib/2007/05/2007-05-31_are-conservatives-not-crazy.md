Are conservatives not crazy?

[Chris of Mixing Memory](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/05/are_conservatives_less_creativ.php) has a post up titled [Are Conservatives Less Creative?](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/05/are_conservatives_less_creativ.php). I joked with him that basically creativity is strongly coupled with being mentally on edge, after all, who would really follow their muse on the high risk stakes of a creative career which will likely be characterized by penury? But in any case, check it out. Iâ€™ve seen other stuff which show small correlations like this, but, as I mentioned to him what **really matters are the tails**. Sure, a statistically significant greater number of Leftish folk might cough up the cash for the rec center finger-painting class, but the more important possibility is that the threshold above which one sees artistic virtuosity might be overwhelmingly dominated by those of Left sensibility. This matters of course over the course of history as art is an essential propagandistic tool. Similarly, the recurrent finding that amongst the high IQ those more verbally adept tend to be on the Left and those with stronger mathematical aptitudes tend to be on the Right is also significant in terms of modeling the trajectory of societal evolution and dynamics.
