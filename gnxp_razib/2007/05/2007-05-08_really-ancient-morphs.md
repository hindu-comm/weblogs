Really ancient morphs?

A few years ago Henry Harpending & Greg Cochran published [In our genes](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/99/1/10) in *PNAS*. They focused on the [D4 dopamine receptor](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&q=drd4&btnG=Search+google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) (DRD4) locus as “a model system for understanding the relationship between genetic variation and human cultural diversity.” Check this out, [*Drd4* gene polymorphisms are associated with personality variation in a passerine bird](http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/j515mxt030844304/):

> Polymorphisms in several neurotransmitter-associated genes have been > associated with variation in human personality traits. Among the more > promising of such associations is that between the human dopamine > receptor D4 gene (Drd4) variants and novelty-seeking > behaviour….Frequencies of the three Drd4 SNP830 genotypes, but not the > ID15 genotypes, differed significantly between two P. major lines > selected over four generations for divergent levels of ‘early > exploratory behaviour’ (EEB). Strong corroborating evidence for the > significance of this finding comes from the analysis of free-living, > unselected birds where we found a significant association between > SNP830 genotypes and differing mean EEB levels. These findings suggest > that an association between Drd4 gene polymorphisms and animal > personality variation predates the divergence of the avian and > mammalian lineages. Furthermore, this work heralds the possibility of > following microevolutionary changes in frequencies of behaviourally > relevant Drd4 polymorphisms within populations where natural selection > acts differentially on different personality types.
