Eternal recurrence

I’ve been blogging since spring of 2002. I’ve seen ’em come and go. Interestingly, I’ve noted that three blogs I once followed have sprung back to life after going silent relatively early on in the blosphere’s evolution, [Ideofact](http://ideofact.com/), [Rachel Lucas](http://www.rachellucas.com/) and [Brink Lindsey](http://www.brinklindsey.com/). It’s all rather strange to see people pop up into the cyberworld after such a hiatus, I’ve certainly evolved, but these individuals (less so Brink) have engaged in saltation, if you remember their previous morphs at least.
