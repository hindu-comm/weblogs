First among “equals”?

I have two blogs from *The Atlantic*‘s small flotilla, [Ross Douthat](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/) & [M. Yglesias](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/), in my RSS reader. Now, one thing I notice is that there is a *faux*-tab¹ at the top that allows you to toggle between these two blogs, as well as [James Fallow’s](http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/) & [Andrew Sullivan’s](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/) [Daily Dish](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/). But here’s the thing: **Sullivan’s site *doesn’t have a tab* to toggle back to the other sites within *The Atlantic*‘s blog confederacy!** I suppose it is fair since he has the highest profile and brings the most readers, but I suspect that [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/) might have a word to say about this sort of design architecture in regards to site usability. I mean, if you’re going to have one blog that’s simply laid out in a different manner, make it distinctive enough so you don’t get disoriented looking for the tab to toggle back!  
1 – Note to the designer, make it a *real* tab and change the color so that you know which blog you’re reading! Why be web 1.99 when you can get hit 2.0?
