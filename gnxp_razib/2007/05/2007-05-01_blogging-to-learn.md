Blogging to learn

The post yesterday where I reflect David Dobb’s departure from *ScienceBlogs* made me reconsider why I blog. There are many sorts of blogs out there. Some, like *The Daily Kos*, are involved in affecting social and political change. Others are basically notepads for personal hobbies. Many blogs are run by writers who have a “beat” and try out ideas and supplement their print content on the web. And so on. So why do I blog? **To learn.** I’ve made this pretty implicitly clear before, but I thought I would make it totally clear. This doesn’t mean that other people can’t learn from me, but, fundamentally that is a byproduct of the ultimate reason I blog. From example, right now I am working on a bottom up reductionistic derivation of the breeder’s equation based upon the treatment in [The Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933069/geneexpressio-20). Now, I suppose people may learn something from this, and I hope they do. I try not to be so obscure as to be unintelligible. But, in the **process of reprocessing it for public consumption I refine and clarify my own understanding of concepts!**. And, quite often there are pointers in comments to further reading and exploration of the topics I bring up. This doesn’t mean that in every instance an exchange between myself & a reader has to result in a **net** accumulation of knowledge or conceptual clarity on my part, I’m not totally selfish. But, I certainly wouldn’t blog if over the long haul I felt that I wasn’t getting anything out of the process and dialog. This is why I am such a fundamentalist about having a **high quality, if low quantity**, comment stream (I try to achieve this by a mixture of deletions and abusive treatment to set examples). The world is full of drivel. I can go to the nearest coffee shop and listen as people who know nothing about everything display their ignorance without any self-consciousness. I don’t blog to replicate that sort of “third place” online.
