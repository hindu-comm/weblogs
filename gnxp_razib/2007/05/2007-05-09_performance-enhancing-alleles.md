Performance-enhancing alleles

Yann [points](https://yannklimentidis.blogspot.com/2007/05/genetics-of-speed-in-dogs.html) to [an article](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030079.eor) on a mutation in dogs that leads to increased muscle mass and speed:

> Here we describe a new mutation in MSTN found in the whippet dog breed > that results in a double-muscled phenotype known as the “bully” > whippet. Individuals with this phenotype carry two copies of a > two-base-pair deletion in the third exon of MSTN leading to a > premature stop codon at amino acid 313.

The myostatin gene in humans plays a similar role in muscle growth– a deletion in the gene leads to extreme muscularity, as evidenced by the “[Baby Superman](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002287.html)“. The gene has also been [shown to be under recent selection](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/selection-for-more-muscle.php) in humans–variants presumed to lead to more muscularity are far more common in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper in dogs shows that increased muscularity also leads to better performance in competititve racing events; it’s not such a strech to believe the same could be true in humans as well.
