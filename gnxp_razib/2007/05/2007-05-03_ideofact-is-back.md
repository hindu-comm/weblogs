Ideofact is back

Every few months I check in on blogs which were around and active when GC & I first started back in 2002. Most of them remain inactive, but I just noticed that [Bill Allison](http://ideofact.com/) is back at [Ideofact](http://ideofact.com/). If you didnâ€™t check him out the first time, swing by.
