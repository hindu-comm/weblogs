Mark Chu-Carroll on Edge of Evolution

I’m not normally a big fan of fisking anti-evolutionists (the rotten fruit hands too low), but Mark Chu-Carroll of [Good Math, Bad Math](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/05/behes_dreadful_new_book_a_revi_1.php) has a very funny (and obviously enraged) response to Michael Behe’s newest piece of work, [The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of Darwinism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743296206/geneexpressio-20). Readers of this blog might find Carroll’s analysis of Behe’s misuse of the idea of fitness landscapes very informative. I find fitness landscapes fascinating myself, but if your reading of them is telling you that evolution can’t happen, then I think the logical thing would be to look at the problems with landscapes. They aren’t exactly rock-hard formal systems at this point. Until recently they weren’t really formal at all, and [Will Provine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Provine) has made the case that for two scientific generations everyone used them in an incoherent fashion (including their originator, Sewall Wright).
