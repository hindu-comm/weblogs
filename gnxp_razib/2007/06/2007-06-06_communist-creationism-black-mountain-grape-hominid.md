Communist Creationism – “Black Mountain Grape Hominids”

Earlier, I have implied that anti-scientific sensibilities will survive the “death of organized religion,” because they preceded the rise of such supernatural peddling institutions. Of the two Korean states, the Republic of South Korea, where 40% of the population are theists is the God intoxicated half. At least on paper. North Korea is an atheistic Communist culture, but I’ve stated to friends many a time in reality it is basically a “god-kingdom,” more akin to Pharonic Egypt than a modern nation-state, except with the capacity for totalitarianism. Many of the social and psychological sentiments that might normally be channeled into mass religion seem to be focused upon the cult of the divine family. Well, just to show you that humans aren’t that creative, check out this YouTube of North Korean propoganda which suggests that the Pyongyang area is the locus of our species’ origin.
