Paternity test without DNA

[Eye on DNA](http://www.eyeondna.com/2007/06/17/determining-paternity-without-a-dna-test/) links to [this](http://www.genetree.com/resource/traitsPaternityTest.php) online paternity calculator, which takes into account blood group, eye color, and earlobe type to determine whether a guy’s traits are consistent with paternity. Kind of cool. Someone actually asked me whether this was possible the other day, and the earlobes thing was the only one I could come up with. Eye, skin, and hair color are all kind of tricky; I doubt they get much precision from their eye color measure.

Any trait with fairly simple inheritance should do the trick; the problem is that most aren’t easily visible. Ability to roll your tongue could be a marker, for example. Anyone else got thoughts?
