Treat the stranger as you would be treated

[Spontaneous Altruism by Chimpanzees and Young Children](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050184):

The **roots** of altruism may go back quite far indeed; the elaboration and extension, not so much. After all, pigeons and rats [have numeracy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195132408/geneexpressio-20/). Only humans have math. This might be the case where it is not the sufficiency of one necessary condition but the necessity of multiple conditions.
