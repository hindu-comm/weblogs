Mitochondrial genetics

Most studies of the genetics of human traits focus on a specific disease phenotype, or some extreme of phenotypic variation that a clinician can call “pathological”. Because of this disease-centric approach, the genetics of basic cellular processes often go unstudied in humans (I’m not kidding when I say some medical doctors and clinicians were resistant to the idea of looking at the [genetics of gene expression](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v32/n4s/abs/ng1036.html), one of the most logical places to start understanding the cell). However, complex diseases are, as the name implies, complex; it’s certainly of interest to study the various pathways involved in their aetiology in isolation.

It might not be the “sexiest” phenotype to look at, but this [new paper](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/12/1504?etoc), on the genetics of mitochondrial genome number, is an excellent example of such a “reductionist” approach. Variation in mitochondrial genome number and integrity is important in a number of human diseases, including common and expensive ones like Type II diabetes– finding the genes involved in this phenotype will be an important part of any systems-level model of such diseases.
