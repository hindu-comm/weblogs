Parents matter…and they don't

First, [Daddies’ girls choose men just like their fathers](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-06/du-dgc061107.php):

> Women who enjoy good childhood relationships with their fathers are > more likely to select partners who resemble their dads research > suggests. In contrast, the team of psychologists from Durham > University and two Polish institutions revealed that women who have > negative or less positive relationships were not attracted to men who > looked like their male parents. >

The team used facial measurements to give a > clear view of how fathers’ facial features relate directly to the > features of faces their daughters find attractive.

This comes *very close* in my book to “they had to do a study on that???” That being said, it is somewhat interesting in light of the finding that [daughters](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/fathers_allele_knows_best.php) [prefer men](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/fathers_allele_knows_best.php) who smell like dad (MHC).

In other news, [Male Depression Is Linked to Poor Sibling Relations](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/health/psychology/12sibl.html?_r=1&oref=slogin), not the parent-child relationship.
