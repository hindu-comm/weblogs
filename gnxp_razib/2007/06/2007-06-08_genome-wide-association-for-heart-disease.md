Genome-wide association for heart disease

Following on the heels of the results of the [Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/06/genome-wide-association-studies-in-uk.php) are [two](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/316/5830/1488) [papers](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/316/5830/1491) reporting associations between risk of coronary heart disease/heart attack and an allele on chromosome 9. Like many of the signals coming out of these recent genome-wide studies, the polymorphism implicated is not in a gene, and no functional effect is immediately obvious; this will take a while to sort out.

This is another promising result, though. The nay-sayers who argued against the HapMap and whole-genome association are finding themselves proved very wrong. As is often the case in science, the Luddite position was not tenable– technology opens all sorts of doors for biology, and [a paper from 1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8801636) (which was for essentially science fiction at the time) has proved quite prescient.
