Circumcision – roundheads vs. cavaliers

The debate below about circumcision has gotten fast and furious. I stand in the untenable position of neither believing that circumcision should be promoted by the authorities as a “health” precaution in the modern world, but also not considering it an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. That being said, one thing that should be value neutral are statistics. [Here is a description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_worldwide) of the regions of the world where circumcision is and isn’t routine. In short, it is a common practice in most of Africa, with the exception of the southern portion of the continent. It is normative amongst Muslims, in the United States and a few nations which imitated American practice such as South Korea and the Philippines. Here are the rates for US regions over the past decade or so:
