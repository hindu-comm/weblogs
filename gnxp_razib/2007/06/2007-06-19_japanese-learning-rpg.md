Japanese Learning RPG

I know this isn’t the Learn Japanese forum, but when I have time for playing around I’ve been enjoying this Final Fantasy / Zelda takeoff that helps you with katakana, hiragana, and some kanji. It is called [Slime Forest](http://lrnj.com/). The slimes attack and yell characters at you to which you must respond appropriately. Save the princess!
