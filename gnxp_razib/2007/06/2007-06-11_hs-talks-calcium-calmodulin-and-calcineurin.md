HS talks: calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin

A recent paper issue of Cell came with an ad for the Calcium Signalling series from Henry Stewart Talks. These are apparently nicely produced lecture-format videos from experts reviewing diverse areas of biology. Iâ€™m not willing to shell out the \$690 it would take to view the whole thing, but they have a free talk of the month: [Calcium, Calmodulin, and Calcineurin by Stephen Bolsover](http://www.hstalks.com/free-talks/index.htm) that you might want to kick back with a glass of red and consume.
