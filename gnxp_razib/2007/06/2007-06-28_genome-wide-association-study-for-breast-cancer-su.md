Genome-wide association study for breast cancer susceptibility

Another [genome-wide association study](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7148/abs/nature05887.html):

> Breast cancer exhibits familial aggregation, consistent with variation > in genetic susceptibility to the disease. Known susceptibility genes > account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and > the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants > conferring more moderate risks. To identify further susceptibility > alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in > 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third > stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were **tested > for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls** \[!!!\] from 22 > studiesâ€¦ SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and > consistent evidence of association with breast cancer (P \< 10-7). > Four of these contain plausible causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 > and LSP1).

These alleles are of small effect and in areas of the genome about which little is known, again showing that genome-wide association studies are a powerful way of opening up research into novel biology.
