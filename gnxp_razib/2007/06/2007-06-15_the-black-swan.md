The Black Swan

[![blackswan.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/blackswan.gif?resize=105%2C151)![blackswan.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/blackswan.gif?resize=105%2C151)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400063515/geneexpressio-20/)Tyler Cowen has a [nice review](http://www.slate.com/id/2167993/pagenum/all/) in *Slate* (actually, a slice & summation) of [Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) most recent book, [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400063515/geneexpressio-20/). Taleb’s discursive and meandering narrative delves mostly into the domains of economics, statistics and psychology, so Cowen is in a good place to tackle his argument. Myself, I was intrigued by the jeremiad against the [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) and [Poisson distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution). Like [Michael Stastny](http://mahalanobis.twoday.net/stories/3628077/) I think Taleb goes *a bit* too far. Nevertheless, I have to wonder about the fact that though we model characteristics like IQ as a bell curved Gassian distribution, **the tails are invariably fat**. That is, beyond 2 or 3 standard deviations above or below the norm there start to be many more individual as an empirical matter who exhibit a particular value then the distribution would predict. One might make the case that in those north of 3 standard deviations are particularly important in shaping the path which our species takes through history. In evolutionary biology R.A. Fisher long promoted a gradualist paradigm predicated on the substitution of alleles of small effect which resulted in minimal deviation of a character’s central tendency over a short period of time, but, as I have noted recent work implies that a large role maybe played by mutations of large effect. Veritable genetic “Black Swans.” The eminent evolutionary geneticist [James F. Crow](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/10-questions-for-jim-crow.php) told me last year that “…Nature seems to follow [least-squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-squares) principles.” Taleb would surely beg to differ, and no doubt emphasize the ubiquity of non-linearity and the enormous biological import of the rare anomalous deviation from the regression line.
