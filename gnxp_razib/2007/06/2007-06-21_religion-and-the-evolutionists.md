Religion and the “evolutionists”

Greg Graffin & Will Provine [report](http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/55593/page/1?&print=yes) on the results of the [Cornell Evolution Project](http://www.cornellevolutionproject.org/) in *The American Scientist*. Emerging out ot Graffin’s Ph.D. work it is a survey of prominent evolutionary biologists (see the [full list](http://www.cornellevolutionproject.org/evolutionists.html)) in regards to their views about religion and science. Their conclusion is:

> Only 10 percent of the eminent evolutionary scientists who answered > the poll saw an inevitable conflict between religion and evolution. > The great majority see no conflict between religion and evolution, not > because they occupy different, noncompeting magisteria, but because > they see religion as a natural product of human evolution. > Sociologists and cultural anthropologists, in contrast, tend toward > the hypothesis that cultural change alone produced religions, minus > evolutionary change in humans. The eminent evolutionists who > participated in this poll reject the basic tenets of religion, such as > gods, life after death, incorporeal spirits or the supernatural. Yet > they still hold a compatible view of religion and evolution.

…and now, here’s the lead author in the music video for “Punk Rock Song” (he’s vocals)….

Here’s an [article](http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2007/mar/01/evolution_professor/) about Graffin’s double life as a musician and academic.
