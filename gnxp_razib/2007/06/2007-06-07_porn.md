Porn

The [LA Daily News](http://www.dailynews.com/) is doing a [lush series](http://lang.dailynews.com/socal/editorial/inter/x_valley/xxx_valley_5.html) on porn. Theyâ€™re flash files, so be aware of that, though nothing I saw was not work safe. The ubiquity of porn chronicled in that series in America today is worth keeping in mind when we simultaneously have a [teacher convicted of a felony](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/06/teacher_granted.html) because she inadvertently exposed some of her students to porn pop-ups (spyware which another teacher mistakenly installed).
