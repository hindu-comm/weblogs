Synthetic biology

Carl Zimmer has an [interesting post](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/06/07/new_life_new_patent.php#more) on Craig Venterâ€™s goal of making a synthetic organism. Apparently, Venter has filed for a patent on the process (essentially, synthesizing a minimum number of genes necessary for life, and transforming it into a cell).
