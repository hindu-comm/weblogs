Immigration bill

An FOB (friend of the blog) has a prescription for how you can be proactive if you are a restrictionist and want to affect the pending senatorial proceedings.

> According to Krikorian and Kaus, these are the 12 Senators on the > fence (there may be more). Perhaps you could post this list with the > following directions. It took me all of 10 minutes to do this. >
> 1\) open up each link in a new tab in Firefox >
> 2\) prepare a message in a text editor, such as the following: >
> “Dear Senator, >
> Please vote AGAINST cloture on the upcoming immigration bill. It is > a  
> disaster and would be ruinous for this country if passed. Thank you. >
> Sincerely, >
> XXX >
> \[Signature with affiliations, etc. may also be useful to include\]” >
> 3\) paste it into each text field, update the contact info, and hit > send.  
> It’s ok if you’re out of state, the Senate in particular is a > national  
> organ. >
