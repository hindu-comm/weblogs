Leech Notice

As you might guess, my site is one of the sources of content. If you’re reading this post at New York Articles rather than at my actual site, you are partaking of a suboptimal experience.  
I’m not going to give you the URL for the lesser, because there is no value-added to speak of, unless you count the pennies that come in to the leech that grabs the RSS and sells the Google Ads.  
Does such a site do anything to improve an already crowded blogosphere? Does anyone treat a sloppy feed aggregating site of this sort as a regular destination (or really, as anything but an accidental destination)?  
Pathetic.
