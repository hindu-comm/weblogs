Safari Library

Recently I resubscribed to the [Safari](http://safari.oreilly.com/) online tech library (a lot of [O’Reilly](http://oreillynet.com/) titles, but not exclusively) after a hiatus of a few years. Previously their system was basically like Netflix, you could put some items on your bookshelf contingent upon your subscription level. Now they have a [\$40/month level](http://safari.oreilly.com/library) where you have full access to their whole library! Of course, there’s really nothing in there that you couldn’t find through clever google searches, but if time is \$ it really does make it a lot simpler to have it all in one place.
