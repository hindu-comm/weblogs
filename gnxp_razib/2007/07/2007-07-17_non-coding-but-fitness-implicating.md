Non-coding, but fitness implicating?

[Widely distributed noncoding purifying selection in the human genome](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0705140104v1?rss=1) (*PNAS*):

> **It is widely assumed that human noncoding sequences comprise a > substantial reservoir for functional variants impacting gene > regulation and other chromosomal processes**. Evolutionarily conserved > noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the human genome have attracted > considerable attention for their potential to simplify the search for > functional elements and phenotypically important human alleles. A > major outstanding question is whether functionally significant human > noncoding variation is concentrated in CNSs or distributed more > broadly across the genome.

Purifying selection basically works against mutations which result in functional changes which might be deleterious; so it operates as a constraining force upon genetic diversification.
