Most phenotypic evolution is neutral

Still not convinced? See below the fold for some (tame but NSFW) evidence that phenotypic evolution tends not to have to do with survival and reproduction.

Data gathered from fieldwork in [Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOGd2FRf0A), [Turkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFY-HDXZM4E), and [Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QmIcczwKE). Comparable data could not be found for blue-eyed, blonde-haired Finland. That probably doesnâ€™t mean anything either.
