The demographics of top law professors

Via a reader I found a [Imbler Volokh](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_07_08-2007_07_14.shtml#1184046901) [post](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2007_07_08-2007_07_14.shtml#1184046901) on the demographics of top yong law professors. You can see his [spreadsheet here](http://volokh.com/files/top50young.xls). Volokh says:

I generally track data about the medical and the scientific profession because I have friends in these fields (e.g., around 1 out of 20 to 1 out of 10 medical students in the USA currently is probably of South Asian ancestry). I didn’t know much about law, it seems a field where cultural fluency matters much more than in medicine or the natural sciences, so I assumed that persons of Asian ancestry wouldn’t be well represented.
