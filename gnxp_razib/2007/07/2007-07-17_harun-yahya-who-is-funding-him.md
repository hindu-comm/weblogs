Harun Yahya – who is funding him?

As a follow up to my post mocking Harun Yahya, check out Ali Eteraz’s [impressive post](http://eteraz.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/refuting-harun-yahya-islamic-creationism-and-who-is-funding-this-pseudo-science/) exploring his possible sources of funding and affiliations. My own immediate instinct was to assume that he was a front for Saudi \$\$\$; Ali points to reasons why this is unlikely. The argument is circumstantial and based on elimination of possibilities, but at least it pushes the ball forward.
