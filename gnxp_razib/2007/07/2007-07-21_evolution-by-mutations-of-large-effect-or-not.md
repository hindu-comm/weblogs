Evolution by mutations of large effect…or not?

[](http://biology.plosjournals.org/archive/1545-7885/4/9/figure/10.1371_journal.pbio.0040290.g008-M.jpg)The model of evolution that came out of the “Modern Synthesis” (see the figure on [this site](http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/faculty/chao.html)) predicts that evolution by natural selection occurs as a sort of stepwise optimization algorithm– that is, a population will approach some fitness “peak” in a series of small steps, rather than all at once. This sounds rather reasonable– making small changes to an organism is more “conservative”, in some sense, than drastic restructuring with a single mutation, and thus less likely to knock out critical pathways. Yet there have seemed to be some examples of a single locus controlling major morphological differences between species. One example comes from *Drosphila*, where two species–*D. melanogaster* and *D. sechellia*–show rather different devlopmental patterns at a certain larval stage. This difference has been mapped (via inter-species crosses– unfortunately not something that can be done in, say, humans and chimps) to a single locus referred to as shavenbaby (this being *Drosophila*, gene naming conventions are, well, non-existent).

However, it was unclear whether the changes in the regulation of shavenbaby were due to a single mutation of large effect, or several mutations of smaller effect. The latter would be predicted by the Fisherian model, and indeed, [new research](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature05988.html) has found the precise genetic changes underlying the difference, showing that there are several mutations in different [enhancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_%28genetics%29) that individually generate smaller changes in shavenbaby expression.

The position of the gene in the developmental network is shown in the figure (from [here](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040290)), and the authors speculate that the reason for multiple regulatory changes at this single locus is due to the architecture of the network. In their words:

> Given that laboratory-induced mutations in dozens of genes alter > trichome patterns \[the developmental pattern in question here\], it > is striking that multiple mutations at a single locus account for the > entire evolved difference. Svb seems peculiar in the network of > genetic interactions that establish the trichome pattern, because it > sits at the nexus of the upstream patterning genes and the downstream > effector genes. Although trichome pattern could be changed by altering > any of several upstream genes, these changes would probably produce > pleiotropic effects on other developmental processes. In contrast, > none of the known downstream genes is sufficient on its own to prevent > or promote trichome formation. Thus, **changes at svb enhancers may > provide the only available genetic mechanism to evolve trichome > patterns without pleiotropic consequences**.

Mutations cannot be fully studied in isolation– they do not exist outside the context of genetic and biochemical networks.
