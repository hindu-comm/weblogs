Open thread….

People have bugged me about the “open thread” for a while, so by popular demand, it’s back. It will be to the right indefinitely, though I’ll purge it of old/tardish comments regularly. Please place interesting links/sites, etc. (this includes items of interest to young straight males, \*hint\*, \*hint\*).
