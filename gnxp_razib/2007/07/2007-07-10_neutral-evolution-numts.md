Neutral evolution & numts

Apropos of the recent drift vs. selection debates in regards to the driving forces of evolution, I thought I’d pass on this [press release](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070709114540.htm) about the pervasiveness of neutral genetic elements. You can read the [full *provisional* paper](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030119.eor) in PLOS Genetics:

> Using sequence analysis and fossil dating, we also show a probable > burst of integration of numts in the primate lineage that centers on > the prosimian-anthropoid split, mimics closely the temporal > distribution of Alu and processed pseudogene acquisition, and > coincides with the major climatic change at the Paleocene-Eocene > boundary. We therefore propose a model according to which the gross > architecture and repeat distribution of the human genome can be > largely accounted for **by a population bottleneck early in the > anthropoid lineage and subsequent effectively neutral fixation of > repetitive DNA, rather than positive selection or unusual insertion > pressures.**
