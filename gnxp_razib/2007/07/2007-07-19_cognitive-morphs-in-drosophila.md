Cognitive morphs in Drosophila

[Natural polymorphism affecting learning and memory in *Drosophila*](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0702923104v1?rss=1):

> Knowing which genes contribute to natural variation in learning and > memory would help us understand how differences in these cognitive > traits evolve among populations and species. We show that a natural > polymorphism at the *foraging* (*for*) locus, which encodes a > cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), affects associative olfactory > learning in *Drosophila melanogaster*. In an assay that tests the > ability to associate an odor with mechanical shock, **flies homozygous > for one natural allelic variant of this gene (*for^(R)*) showed better > short-term but poorer long-term memory than flies homozygous for > another natural allele** (*for^(s)*). The *for^(s)* allele is > characterized by reduced PKG activity. We showed that *for^(R)*-like > levels of both short-term learning and long-term memory can be induced > in *for^(s)* flies by selectively increasing the level of PKG in the > mushroom bodies, which are centers of olfactory learning in the fly > brain. Thus, the natural polymorphism at *for* may mediate an > evolutionary tradeoff between short- and long-term memory. **The > respective strengths of learning performance of the two genotypes seem > coadapted** with their effects on foraging behavior: *for^(R)* flies > move more between food patches and so could particularly benefit from > fast learning, whereas *for^(s)* flies are more sedentary, which > should favor good long-term memory.
