Neuroscience, cancer/biology, math videos

Recently purchased a video iPod. I am the nerd sitting outside the coffeeshop groking brain network dynamics on my tiny screen. At least my case is stylish.

Here is a trove on that subject:  
[Conference on Brain Network Dynamics, 1/26/2007](http://sulcus.berkeley.edu/wjf/2007BrainNetworkDynamicsUCBConference/2007BrainNetworkDynamicsUCBConferenceVids.html)

That conference was in part a tribute to Walter Freeman. Here is more from him:  
[Poetry of Brains](http://sulcus.berkeley.edu/FreemanWWW/Videos/POB/POB.html)

Digging around more you can find several videos from the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/all_seminars.php). For instance, [Micro-circuits of Episodic Memory: Structure Matches Function in the Hippocampal System](http://www.archive.org/details/Redwood_Center_2007_05_08_Lokendra_Shastri), and a debate entitled “Waves or words in cortex?” [featuring Professor Freeman](http://www.archive.org/details/RedwoodCenterforTheoreticalNeuroscienceWalterJFreemanAfieldtheoreticapproachtounderstandingneocortex) again.

On the mathy tip, you can download .mov’s on some pretty interesting topics from the [Mathematical Sciences Research Institute](http://www.msri.org/communications/vmath/index_html). If someone can point me to a converter so I can carry them around with me I would be muy grateful. I’m more interested in the ones that seem to have some relation to biology such as Frances Tong on [Normalization of Western Blots](http://www.msri.org/communications/vmath/VMathVideos/VideoInfo/2537/show_video).

Speaking of .movs to convert. I found an extensive discussion by Mark Ptashne on his book, A Genetic Switch. Presumably this coincided with the release of the new edition: [A Genetic Switch, Lecture Series](http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/56400.cfm).
