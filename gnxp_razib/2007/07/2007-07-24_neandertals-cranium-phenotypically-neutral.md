Neandertals cranium phenotypically neutral?

**Update II:** John Hawks leaves a comment.  
**Update:** Kambiz [has much more](http://anthropology.net/2007/07/24/can-one-use-natural-selection-or-genetic-drift-to-explain-human-and-neandertal-cranial-differences/) comment.

I am generally skeptical of drift as a catchall explanation (it often serves as a *deus ex machina*, just as sexual selection has become), but from what little I have gleaned from paleoanthropology it seems that some workers contend that the morphological differences between Neandertals and “modern” humans are overemphasized. I’m thinking here body form, e.g., the short & stocky build typical of Arctic peoples. Obviously the consistent patterns of changes in size and proportion of large mammalian species (larger & stockier the further north) across many taxa point to common selective pressures due to environment; but what about cranium? I simply don’t know. **I do know that human bone structure and teeth have become less robust over the last 10,000 years, perhaps due to agriculture**. This might simply be relaxing the selection for more robust physiques. I hope [John](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog) takes a minute from his grant application and comments….
