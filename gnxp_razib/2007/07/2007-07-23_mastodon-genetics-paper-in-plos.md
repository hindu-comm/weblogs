Mastodon genetics paper in PLOS

The Mastodon paleogenomics [paper](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050207) is out on *PLOS*:

> We obtained the sequence from a tooth dated to 50,000-130,000 years > ago, increasing the specimen age for which such palaeogenomic analyses > have been done by almost a complete glacial cycle. Using this > sequence, together with mitochondrial genome sequences from two > African elephants, two Asian elephants, and two woolly mammoths (all > of which have been previously sequenced), we show that mammoths are > more closely related to Asian than to African elephants. Moreover, we > used a calibration point lying outside the Elephantidae radiation > (elephants and mammoths), which enabled us to estimate accurately the > time of divergence of African elephants from Asian elephants and > mammoths (about 7.6 million years ago) and the time of divergence > between mammoths and Asian elephants (about 6.7 million years ago). > **These dates are strikingly similar to the divergence time for > humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, and raise the possibility that the > speciation of mammoth and elephants and of humans and African great > apes had a common cause**.

I don’t know much about paleobiology, but the idea that there might be correlated speciation events across multiple taxa sounds like the [Turnover Pulse Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover-pulse_hypothesis).
