The typical GNXP reader

When you’ve blogged for a while, and with some frequency, you wonder what this is all about. I don’t generally get too caught up in that, there’s more interesting stuff to contemplate. But, check out this from Google Analytics for the past 30 days of traffic for this website:

I’ve long known that most GNXP “readers” are “one off” events. I have no problem with that, **if they find what they’re looking for then you’ve done some good**. That being said, I was a little shocked (and pleased, frankly) to see that over **8,000 visitors have arrived over 200 times in the past 30 days!** I don’t know, or care, about the details of how Google calculates this, rather, I’m interested in the *gestalt* sense of what’s going on. Obviously the same people don’t come everyday, but our unique visitor traffic has been in the 2,000-4,000 range for years, so these data together suggest that many people skip days (perhaps refreshing the site a lot on the weekend, or during one particular post where they participated in the thread?).
