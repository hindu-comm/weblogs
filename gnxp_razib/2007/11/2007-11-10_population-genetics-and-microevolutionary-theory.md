Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory

[![](https://i0.wp.com/media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage/10/04714095/0471409510.jpg?w=640)![](https://i0.wp.com/media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage/10/04714095/0471409510.jpg?w=640)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409510/geneexpressio-20/)Due to positive mentions from readers and friends I finally got Alan Templeton’s [Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409510/geneexpressio-20/). I’ve read a few chapters and skimmed through much of the book, and my current take is that it’s a bit too wordy in the exposition. I’d have preferred that there be more technical boxes and a more thorough scattering of compact formalisms. That being said, Templeton is a clear writer and the text is pretty penetrable (I enjoyed the coverage of quantitative genetics especially). Also, he didn’t seem to take a kitchen-sink approach, a few themes came in for thorough treatment. If you’re interested in familiarizing yourself with this field I still think [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20/) is a better bet, but then you know my biases which I stated above.
