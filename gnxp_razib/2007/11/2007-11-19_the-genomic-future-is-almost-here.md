The genomic future is almost here?

[Technology dramatically speeds gene mapping](http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/ci_7498557). A short little piece which repeats the standard mantras; faster, cheaper and better. The Human Genome Project was proof of principle. Right now, with all the stuff that is starting to bubble up around personal genomics it looks like we’re at a technological and social point of no return, the second derivative is positive, the the rate of change is increasing. [Hsien-Hsien](http://eyeondna.com/) is going to have to start getting a bit more selective about what she blogs about since the sample space of upon which the commentary is based will start to rapidly increase in size.  
Though I do have to say stuff like this gets a bit old:

**No shit we’re more similar than we’re different!!!** I mean, we’re more similar than we’re different when we compare a human sequence to a chimp, a dog, a mouse. I’m more similar to you, dear reader, than I am to a chimpanzee, I can guarantee you that. But, I’m more similar to my brothers than I am to you, dear reader, by some fraction of genes that are identical by state and vary within the human population. Let’s keep it real, some of the most interesting stuff coming out of genomics is going to be how people are different, special, unique if you will. People aren’t going to pay money to find out how they’re just like everyone else, they want to know specific things about them which they don’t know logically from the fact that they are human (e.g., would you ask a genomics company to check to see if your profile matches that of an organism with a bilateral body plan?).  
Granted, there is the major issue of low frequency disease causing alleles. Here are situations where you want to know that you’re like everyone else, and if you aren’t, perhaps you’re a carrier so you need to know this in terms of planning your life with your spouse if they are a carrier as well. But here again the issue is variation. If you find out that you are Wild Type, great for you, but that’s the expectation. If you find out that you have a minority frequency allele which might cause issues, well, the consequences are grave. Similarly, there are a range of genes which are highly polymorphic and alleles of moderate frequency are just floating around segregating within the population. This is where the meat of the stuff people are going to pay for is going to be. Do I have an allele that makes susceptible to a freaky disease (or my offspring?). What alleles do I have which contribute to the normal range of variation and what does that mean for my potential offspring? If similarity between people was where all the fruit were we would have stopped at Craig Venter’s genome. At a certain point this stuff about “We’re all so similar!” starts to get insulting. After all, I look at a monkey, and I look at a random person on the street, and it’s pretty obvious that I’m not that different from that person when compared to the monkey (no offense to monkeys).
