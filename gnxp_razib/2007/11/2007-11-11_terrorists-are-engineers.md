Terrorists are engineers

Engineers are not terrorists, rather, the inverse. At least in some circumstances. [Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/why-are-so-many.html?cid=89543690) points me to a new paper, [Engineers of the jihad](http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/gambetta/Engineers%20of%20Jihad.pdf):

We also find that > engineers alone are strongly over-represented among graduates in > violent groups in both realms.

My own working model is that engineers (and quantitative scientists) tend to go crazy because their mental outlook is relatively rigid. You don’t want to be that creative if you’re an applied scientist, you need to take the truths of science as givens and derive practical results. The same tendency can result in a naive fundamentalist outlook when the truths of religion are taken as givens. Additionally, it seems to me a sociological reality that aspirant sub-elites are also the best recruits due to their resentments against an “unjust” order (their talent running up against the fact that they lack culture in the snobby sense as well as connections to leverage their professional competence maximally). The interesting point is that Islamic radicals in Western countries don’t fit this profile. I suspect that they can be best modeled as a more conventional class/ethnic nationalism dynamic.
