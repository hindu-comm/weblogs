The Brainbow

[](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/brainbow.jpg)Alex Palazzo has a little post on the “[brainbow mouse](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2007/11/brainbow_mouse_a_new_way_to_ma.php#more)“, created using some of the transgenic methods mentioned by amenestic in [a post a while back](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/02/transgenic-methods-in-mice.php). Each individual neuron in a given mouse brain expresses a random combination of fluorescent proteins, allowing analysis with the naked eye. Pretty amazing stuff.
