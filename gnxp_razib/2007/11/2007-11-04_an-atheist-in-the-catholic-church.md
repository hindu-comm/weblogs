An atheist in the Catholic Church

In my post below I wanted to emphasize that religion has several distinct and independent dimensions. Too often in our modern era religion is reduced purely to the dimension of confession or belief because of its relative accessibility to outsiders. Here is some of that complexity on display, from page 371 of [The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063207/geneexpressio-20/):

There was once a time when Europe was the Faith and the Faith was Europe. To some extent this did enforce a greater degree of outward belief, but at the extremes there were likely individuals would could never suffer a religious outlook. With the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church in secular affairs it is no surprise that unbelievers used it as an institutional ladder from which they derived instrumental benefit.
