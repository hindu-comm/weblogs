Chat

As some of you have noticed I’ve added the chat feature to the right sidebar. If you click the pop up you’ll get a bigger screen. I’ll be making more changes soon. I decided to put it on site so people could see what was going on…the down side is that the app auto logs in everyone who visits the front of the site (I’m not outputting the chat window on individual entries and archives for those of you reading via RSS), though I gave them nicks of the form “zanon” so they’d be at the bottom of the list. I’ll be tweaking/fixing as we go along time & inclination permitting.

P.S. My philosophy is to test on Firefox and fix on everything else, so warned….
