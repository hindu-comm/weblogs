GNXP Chat

I‚Äôve installed a AJAX chat app, here

<http://gnxp.com/blog/chat/>

I don‚Äôt know if it will last. A few ground rules:

1\) Don‚Äôt be too stupid‚Ä¶I‚Äôm interested in seeing if people have intelligent things to say üòâ

2\) Please select distinctive nicknames (if you have a regular handle here, use it)

I‚Äôve placed the chat as a link to the right (below the RSS icon). This is AJAX, so IE & Firefox are best, etc. etc.

The main reason I added this today is that some of the comment threads basically turn into 2-person chats back and forth. If something like that is going on, it might be good to have an option of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take this to chat.‚Äù More productive for everyone.
