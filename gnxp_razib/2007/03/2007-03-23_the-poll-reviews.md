The poll, reviews

Well, [the poll](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/poll-time.php) has been running for a week. Nothing changes around these parts. 85-90% of regular readers are male. A plural majority identify as “libertarians,” though there is a rough political balance along the normal Left-Right range with a slight Center-Right skew. One thing that I will comment on though is the fact that though we have many readers who have been around various periods of time, there is a definite dearth of those who say they’ve been reading for less than 6 months vs. 1 week. Only at 1-2 years do we surpass those who say they’ve been reading for less than a week. Do we have an influx of new blood? I doubt it. Rather, the half life of a GNXP reader is likely pretty low. The majority of those of you who count yourselves as “regular” readers, but have only sampled a few weeks worth of posts, will find us too boring, too offensive or too obnoxious, and take yourselves off to other parts. This is normal. It seems plausible many “short termers” stumbled upon this blog via a link from another blog when we talked about something you were interested it…but it turns out that’s not the real focus of the blog. It happens. I read [Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/) because he was a conservative who was against Intelligent Design. But, it turns out that most of the time I’m not really that into what Bainbridge is talking about, I just checked out his blog because one day he was talking about what I was interested in. Such is life.
