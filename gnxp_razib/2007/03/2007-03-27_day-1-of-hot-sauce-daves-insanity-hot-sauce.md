Day 1 of hot sauce – Dave’s Insanity Hot Sauce

![davepasta.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/03/davepasta.jpg?resize=350%2C350)![davepasta.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/03/davepasta.jpg?resize=350%2C350)So, I tried out [Dave’s Insanity Hot Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Daves-Original-Insanity-Hot-Sauce/dp/B0000DID5R/ref=sr_1_4/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&s=gourmet-food&qid=1175016722&sr=8-4) with some Tuna pasta yesterday. Here’s a comment from Amazon: “I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave’s Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I’ve ever tasted. I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot. This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa.” Hm. So I was warned. I tried a drop…and well, it was spicy, but not *that* spicy. So I tried a dash. Definitely made me sweat, but it wasn’t like I was eating raw habanero or anything. So I tried another dash, and another. I had several servings of pasta and had about 7-8 small dashes in all. And I wasn’t dousing my tongue with water at all. It was spicy, but not world shattering. Additionally, I don’t think I got anything else out of the flavor (i.e., I love the non-spicy flavor in fresh green Thai Peppers). As some reviewers have noted it is a quite one dimensional sauce, the heat is cranked up, but I tasted no concomitant elevation in other flavors (e.g., sour). If fresh habanero is the standard I’d give this sauce a 7 out of 10. It wasn’t a waste of money, but I’m not getting a tub of this.
