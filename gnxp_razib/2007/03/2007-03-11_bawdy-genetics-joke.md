Bawdy genetics joke

I’m sure someone out there’s come up with a similar joke, but here goes.

A woman married to a geneticist decides to file for divorce, although when pressed by her friend, she refuses to say exactly why. She claims it is because she has absorbed too much of her husband’s technical jargon, which has impaired her ability to converse with ordinary people.

However, her friend remains incredulous and inquires further: “I’m afraid I don’t understand — is he not a tenured and respected researcher who brings home a handsome salary? Does he not send you unexpected love letters penned in dulcet tone?”

“Yes, he does all of those things,” she says. “…But let’s just say I’d rather be with someone with whom penetrance were not so stochastic.”
