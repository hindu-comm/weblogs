Why we're not all hot?

[Why some people are more attractive than others](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/uonu-wsp032607.php):

I haven’t read the paper…and the press release sounds kind of garbled. I guess the results here are suggesting that polymorphism at the disease resistence loci (e.g., MHC) is so important that DNA repair mechanisms can’t get too good. A byproduct of this is variance in the mutational load across the population. I suppose this sort of answer to “why we’re not all hot” is like the answer to why we’re not all [parthenogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis).
