March Cell Podcast

Cell’s new issue is accompanied by a podcast ([mp3](http://podcast.cell.com/0308cell2007.mp3)). Let’s hope they start cranking them out regularly. We have interviews with Francis Collins (about knockout mice, not Goddity God God) and Greg Hannon (about piRNAs, \~30 nucleotide regulatory RNAs in mouse nutz). And some other guy (David Fisher) talks about sun tanning and p53, but I never heard of him.
