Emma Darwin, novelist (again)

I mentioned last year that a highly-praised new novelist, [Emma Darwin](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/family-connections-part-n.php), was yet another descendant of you-know-who.

I will therefore provide a link to this [interview](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/03/18/svinsider118.xml) with her in today’s (UK) **Sunday Telegraph**. I see that her novel is now available in paperback, and nominated for a prize.

American readers may be puzzled by the reference to Annie’s Box, by Randal Keynes. This was given a different title for its US publication. I can’t imagine why.
