10 weird things about me

A [new meme](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/03/the_10_weird_things_about_me_m.php#more) about “10 weird things about me” has started on *ScienceBlogs*, so I’ll bite….

  
1) I love shrimp more than any other food.  
2) I love to hate goat cheese more than any other food.  
3) I liked Car Voltron more than Lion Voltron.  
4) I had difficulties with gendered pronouns until 2nd grade, and still occasionally make errors. This is possibly the result of the fact that I did not speak much English before the age of 5, and the language that I did speak lacks gendered pronouns (word of advice, do not refer to 6 year old girls as “he,” they don’t appreciate it).  
5) I’ve read various English translations of the Book of Genesis around 30 times.  
6) I worked on a mule ranch for a bit in my teenage years.  
7) I’ve read very little “serious” fiction.  
8) I stopped drinking milk when I was 5 because my father stopped drinking milk. He began drinking milk again later in life, but I never did, and continue to avoid it.  
9) Female servers in restaurants are often impressed by my spice tolerance (e.g., I can eat two fresh habaneros and enjoy them!).  
10) I think “flamboyently stoic” could accurately describe my manner.
