Why do people believe in God?

Over at [my other blog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/why-do-people-believe-in-god.php) I have a [long post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/why-do-people-believe-in-god.php) where I comment on the recent [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin) in *The New York Times* which highlights the debate around the evolutionary origins of religion.
