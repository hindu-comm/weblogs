The rate of cultural evolution, jerky or smooth?

There has long been a tiresome debate in evolutionary biology (or at least in pop science books about evolutionary biology) whether evolution generally proceeds [gradually or in bursts alternating with stasis](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/02/the_pace_of_evolution_1.php). But I wonder: **what about cultural evolution?** With evolutionary biology we can look at fossils and the molecular substrate to determine the nature of change; with culture it is a little different because of its amorphous character. Some aspects are pretty easy to quantify, for example baby names for example [drift like genes](http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s879314.htm) subject to purely random forces. On the other hand, my perception is that attitudes toward homosexuality have changed *very* fast over the last 15 years, so that some of the positions staked out by “social conservatives” in 2007 would be out of the mainstream for being *too* pro-gay in the late 1980s (here are [polls](http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_poll2.htm)). Has anyone out there plotted changes of attitudes from sources like Gallup and noticed whether the changes were gradual or subject to sharp increases or decreased in frequency?
