Run long, run short….

[Loss of **ACTN3** gene function alters mouse muscle metabolism and shows evidence of positive selection in humans](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng2122.html):

> More than a billion humans worldwide are predicted to be completely > deficient in the fast skeletal muscle fiber protein α-actinin-3 owing > to homozygosity for a premature stop codon polymorphism, R577X, in the > *ACTN3* gene. **The R577X polymorphism is associated with elite > athlete status and human muscle performance**, suggesting that > α-actinin-3 deficiency influences the function of fast muscle fibers. > Here we show that loss of α-actinin-3 expression in a knockout mouse > model results in a shift in muscle metabolism toward the more > efficient aerobic pathway and an increase in intrinsic endurance > performance.

*ScienceNow* has a good [good summary](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/910/3?rss=1) of the background information:

I doubt that European and Asian populations (in this case they used the HapMap samples, whites from Utah and Chinese and Japanese) were selected for marathon running, rather, it seems plausible that this sort of metabolic reshaping has other consequences and implications. The timing of the selective sweeps is around 15,000 years before the present for Europeans and 33,000 for Asians. These are very preliminary numbers obviously (noted by the authors), but they seem a bit old for “maybe it’s agriculture.” Off the top of my head I wonder if this has something to do with colder climates. In any case, also keep in mind that the “Africans” in this sample were Yoruba from Nigeria. I think everyone is curious to see how the [Kalenjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalenjin_people) of Kenya pan out….
