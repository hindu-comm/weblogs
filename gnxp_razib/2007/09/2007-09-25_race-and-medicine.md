Race and medicine

Apropos of a [previous post on race](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/nick-wade-is-eeeeevil.php), PLoS Medicine has just published [two](http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040271) (opinion) [articles](http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040287) on the use of racial categories in medicine. There’s only a cursory treatment of genetics (and the treatment that’s there is pretty bad), but it’s sometimes useful to see another take on the issue. The message I get is that, well, doctors aren’t trained in genetics, so any “race-based” medicine (which is necessarily based on probabilites) is likely to become a sort of “black = medicine X, white = medicine Y” dogma.
