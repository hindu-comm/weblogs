Vitamin D deficiency in India

Last week [I talked about](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/09/why_brown_people_are_different.php) the fact that a significant proportion of the within population variance of skin color in South Asians is due to a mutant allele which is also responsible for a significant fraction of the between population difference for Europeans and Africans. This mutant allele on *SLC24A5* has gone to fixation within the last 10,000 years in Europeans, and increased to great proportions along a broad great swath of southwestern Eurasia and into northern Africa. What’s going on here? A friend commented, “Well, it isn’t like there is going to be Vitamin D deficiency in India.” That seems plausible enough…except I just stumbled onto this paper, [High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and their newborns in northern India](http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/5/1060). The authors chalk up the lack to their diet. I’ve already [suggested](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/07/skin_color_vitamin_d_1.php) nutrient deprivation with the switch to agriculture triggered the spread of the light skin variants in other contexts, and with the presence of the background condition of Vitamin D deficiency possibly driven by diet perhaps evolution is still going on in India?
