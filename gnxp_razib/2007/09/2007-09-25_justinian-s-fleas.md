Justinian's Fleas

A note for readers, there’s a new book aimed at the popular audience, [Justinian’s Flea: Plague, Empire, and the Birth of Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670038555/geneexpressio-20/). You can find reviews [here](http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2072450,00.html) and [here](https://medievalnews.blogspot.com/2007/05/review-of-justinians-flea-plague-empire.html). I’m going to pass on it probably because it is a general interest book which doesn’t introduce any original material, but it looks like some readers of this weblog get something out of it (though do read [Plagues and Peoples](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385121229/geneexpressio-20/) if this genre is new to you).
