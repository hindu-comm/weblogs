The neuroscience of liberals & conservatives

Chris [reviews](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/09/liberal_and_conservative_anter.php) a
[study](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn1979.html) on the cognitive neuroscience of liberalism & conservatism (The LA Times has an [article](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story) on the study). He’s skeptical of the relevance and coherency of the findings. I would add that the [heritability of political orientation is about 0.5](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004096.html), so I don’t doubt that there’s some innate predispositions which predispose individuals toward particular world views. Rather, I think this is analogous to genome surveys which can detect natural selection, but can’t necessarily offer a plausible rationale for why selection occurred on a particular locus. Finally, I would add that my own hunch is that libertarians would probably be with the liberals here; because fundamentally there are some core axioms (individual self-actualization) and ends (a materialistic utilitarianism) which the Left and libertarians share despite the latter’s traditional location on the Right.
