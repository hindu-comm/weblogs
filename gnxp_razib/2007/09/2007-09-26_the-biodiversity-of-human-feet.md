The biodiversity of human feet

[Native Americans get custom sneaker](http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/119077354650540.xml&coll=7):

This is fascinating. The reason these shoes were developed was to encourage physical activity, something that comes more naturally when your feet aren’t aching. Assman has noted before that South Asians might be more flexible than the typical human, which likely results in flatter feet, so this foot’s-eye viewpoint might be pretty practical in tailoring shoes toward populations.
