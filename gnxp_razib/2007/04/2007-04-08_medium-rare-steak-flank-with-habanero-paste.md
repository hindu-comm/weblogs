Medium rare steak flank with habanero paste

![main.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/main.jpg?resize=300%2C222)![main.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/main.jpg?resize=300%2C222)I went to a Thai restaurant I frequent regularly today. The wait & kitchen staff know me, I called ahead to make sure they prepped “the usual,” a medium rare steak served with onion, tomatoes and spicy lime sauce. In my case I like the lime sauce “4-stars spicy,” that is, mixed together with a rich habanero paste. The first time I asked for this they gave me long lecture to make sure I could “handle it.” No more. The chef is kind enough to rub the meat with the sauce before it’s brought out me. When we showed up the server, who was new, told us the specials and took our wine orders. When she came back to take the entree order she asked my girlfriend what she wanted, and then looked at me and smiled, “I was already told what you’d want by the kitchen.” When she brought the plate out the server said some of the guys in the kitchen had tried to have some of the steak and their mouths were on fire. I could only say, “If they could taste what I taste!” Unlike most servers she didn’t seem that impressed, nor did she hover and comment admiringly. In any case, the emulsion of thai chili peppers within the habanero paste, as well as the dash of lime, really makes for a delicious condiment. 8.5 out of 10.
