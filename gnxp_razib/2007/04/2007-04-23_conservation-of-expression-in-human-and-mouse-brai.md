Conservation of expression in human and mouse brains

Speaking of [human brain evolution](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/human-brain-evolving.php), PLoS Genetics gives us [this](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030059), “Conservation of Regional Gene Expression in Mouse and Human Brain”:

> Here we compare gene expression profiles of human motor cortex, > caudate nucleus, and cerebellum to one another and identify genes that > are more highly expressed in one region relative to another. We > separately perform identical analysis on corresponding brain regions > from mice. Within each species, we find that the different brain > regions have distinctly different expression profiles.

Long story short– the human brain is not some freak/miracle; studying mouse brains will be worthwhile as a tool for understanding human brains in general. This is also a step towards understanding what exactly it is that makes a human brain so different genetically from a mouse brain– which developmental pathways have been altered, which parts of the brain most diverged? Previous studies of gene expression evolution have treated the “brain” as a single organ; now we can get in at its finer details.
