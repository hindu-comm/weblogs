Trivializing analogies?

Chris of Mixing Memory [rips into the usual suspects](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/) for analogizing atheist activism with the women’s suffrage movement. I have basically taken a sabbatical from these *SB* intramural debates about religion, Creationism, etc. So I’ll let you comment over there. But, I will offer that I’ve never been jumped for being an atheist, but I have for being a “sand nigger.” So I hope people will maintain some perspective….
