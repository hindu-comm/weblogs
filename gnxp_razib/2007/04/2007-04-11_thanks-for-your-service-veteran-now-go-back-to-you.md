Thanks for Your Service, Veteran- Now “Go Back to Your F****** Country”

I don’t normally blog about stuff like this, but I’ve decided to [link](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/004331.html) to [this story](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/004331.html) about an assault on a Sikh American veteran by a **police officer**. Here’s the [original story](http://www.saldef.org/content.aspx?a=1682) posted by the *Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund*. If this sort of stuff concerns you I encourage you to link as well, with a high enough pagerank some public pressure might ensue. Here’s the relevant bit:

> Mr. Nag then came outside to answer the officer’s questions regarding > the van. The Joliet police officer then demanded that Mr. Nag park the > van inside his garage and not on the driveway, to which Mr. Nag > responded to the officer that it was not possible and that regardless, > the van is parked on his private property and he has a right to park > it on his driveway.  
> At this moment, the officer pulled out his pepper spray and attacked > Mr. Nag. As Mr. Nag screamed in agony, the officer removed his baton > and violently struck Mr. Nag numerous times until he fell to the > ground. While the assault ensued, the officer was reported by both Mr. > and Mrs. Nag as saying, **“You f\*\*\*\*\*\* Arab! You f\*\*\*\*\* > immigrant, go back to you f\*\*\*\*\*\* country before I kill you!”**

**Update:** I’ve closed comments. Not a big deal, my main reason to post this was get the word out to others who might be interested in linking, not solicit commentary. If this is for real, it is scary because police officers are an arm of the state and you simply don’t fight/resist them. I’ve dealt with racists on a personal basis enough times in my life, and thought I acknowledge the relevance and empirical reality of racism I am not one who thinks that we gain anything by waging a **total** jihad against racism in all its possible forms. We live in an imperfect world and we are imperfect people, and response must be proportionate to the harm caused. That being said, it is pretty much a no brainer that this sort of behavior by the powers that be is counterproductive, dangerous and un-American. We give to the police a trust, and when they abuse that trust they need to be called to account.
