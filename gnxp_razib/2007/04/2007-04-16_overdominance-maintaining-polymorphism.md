Overdominance maintaining polymorphism

One of the classic ways to maintain genetic variation with a population is “overdominance,” in short, a state where heterozygotes exhibit greater fitness than the homozygote genotypes. Imagine for example a locus, A, with two alleles, A₁ & A₂. Now, assume the fitness is distributed like so across the genotypes:  
A₁A₁ = 0.75  
A₁A₂ = 1.00  
A₂A₂ = 0.75  
In a random mating population the equilibrium genotypes given particular allele frequencies are described by the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium like so:  
p² + 2pq + q²  
In a diallelic scenario q is by definition 1 – p, resulting in some algebraic simplification (i.e., the above equation is equivalent to p² + 2p{1 – p} + {1 – p}²). We can imagine that A₁ is equivalent to p, while A₂ is equivalent to q. From the fitness values above we then know that the fitness of the genotypes are:  
p² = 0.75  
2pq = 1.00  
q² = 0.75

  
Intuitively what would you expect? **The frequencies of p & q need to equilibrate so that 2pq, the heterozygote, is maximized!** Here is the formalism which describes the frequency of q at equilibirum:  
q = (selection against p)/(selection against p + selection against q)  
Now, fitness equals 1 minus the selection coefficient, that is, 1 – *s*. So, from the numbers above:  
0.50 = (0.25)/(0.25 + 0.25)  
In other words, when homozygotes are less fit than the heterozygote in a diallelic model, and they are of equal fitness, they will be extant within the population at equal frequencies. By the nature of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium the maximum heterozygosity attainable is 0.50 with a diallelic model; and this is exactly what is produced by p & q frequencies of 0.5 within the population . Note that if the selection coefficients “favor” one allele over the the other in a homozygote state the ratio would differ, but if the heterozygote is modally fit then polymporphism will be maintained.  
Of course, this is all abstract. I just assigned “fitness” values without elaborating any scenario. Now, consider this from [Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20):

In other words, in regards to resistance to warfarin the mutant allele exhibits physiological dominance. But, in regards to vitamin K deficiency it does not (insofar as one copy of the wild type allele is enough to prevent the nutritional deficit). The combination of these two physiological processes result in a natural advantage for the heterozygote genotype within the population, which preserves genetic variation and extant frequencies of both the mutant resistance allele and the wild type.  
I thought this example would be apropos since Larry Moran has a [post up](https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/04/dicumarol-and-warfarin-inhibit-blood.html) on the biochemistry of [warfarin](https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/04/dicumarol-and-warfarin-inhibit-blood.html). So go check it out! **Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution, but evolutionary biology without mechanism is lame….**
