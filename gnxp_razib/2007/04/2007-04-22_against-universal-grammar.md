Against Universal Grammar

To all those with some familiarity with psycholinguistics, what do you think about *The New Yorker* by John Colapinto, *The puzzling language of an Amazon tribe*? What are the best commentaries on this thesis? My interest has been piqued, but I’d like to know more (here’s an [article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,414291,00.html) on the tribe in question, and check out the [wiki entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3)).
