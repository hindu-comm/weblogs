Sewall Wright Again

In a recent post on [Sewall Wright](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/on-reading-wright.php) I discussed some of the difficulties of Wright’s work and mentioned that I had been unable to find a derivation of a certain formula in his paper Systems of Mating Part 1. On the remote chance that someone somewhere is tearing their hair out over the same problem, I should mention that I have now found a derivation and will include it in a subsequent post.

Meanwhile, as often happens, I have been sidetracked by related issues: in this case, the so-called debate between Mendelians and Biometricians in the early years of the 20th century, and the work of Pearson, Yule, Fisher and others on the genetic correlation between relatives. (See also Razib’s very interesting post [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/03/population_vs_quantitative_gen.php).) As this is relevant to Wright’s early work, I may write a post on it before I come back to Wright.
