Religion-normed

I have said many times that phrases like “moderate Muslim” must be **normed to the distribution of attitudes amongst Muslims**. To be in the moderate/median central region of the distribution of Islamic beliefs is not the same as being in the moderate/median central region of the distribution of Christian beliefs. I have made it pretty obvious that over the years I have come to the conclusion that selection, so to speak, will probably eventually shift the Muslim median religio-phenotype closer to the Christian one. That being said, [Ali Eteraz](http://eteraz.org/story/2007/4/5/22631/88927) pointed me to an interesting site, [Apostasy and Islam – 100+ Notable Islamic Voices affirming the Freedom of Faith](https://apostasyandislam.blogspot.com/). On the one hand, it is a good thing that there notable Muslims who agree that it is not acceptable that those who disavow the Islamic religion are subject to the death penalty, at least *de jure*, in much of world. But, **the fact that 100 scholars need to be firm and vocal on this issue tells you about the “state of Islam”**.
