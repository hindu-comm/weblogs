Turkey, Islam & the EU

A few years ago I [pointed out](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002878.html) to M. Yglesias that Turkey was more religious than the United States (he emailed me immediately and agreed that that characterization was about right). Less [than a year ago](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/creationist_turkey_shold_not_b.php) I offered that Turkey was a nation with a greater percentage of Creationists than the United States, and so it was not culturally suitable for EU admission. Today M. Yglesias [has a post](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/04/democratic_islamism.php) where he suggests that the AKP, the current moderate Islamist party in power in Turkey is basically an analog to the Republican party. There are obviously differences (see Daniel Larison for [more exposition](http://larison.org/2007/04/30/ak-is-not-turkish-for-gop/)), while the AKP has been from its inception (through itself proper or its predecessors) the vehicle for upwardly mobile religious conservatives, the Republican party has been transformed within the past few generations from a party dominated by elite affluent mainline WASPs to one where evangelicals call the shots (notionally at least). Nevertheless, along with Yglesias I tend to think that the rise of groups like the AKP is a good thing, even if they are regressive they accept the democratic principle and so are agents for long term (I mean generations, not years) cultural evolution. The EU [agrees](http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200704/beb3ee18-7254-4e48-84ff-a935e6f1fb53.htm). But here is a paradox: I believe that genuine cultural democraticization makes it less plausible that Turkey could be an EU member because at the grassroots it is a far less European nation than its secular elite wants to project.1 And yet the same people who would wink at the idea of dividing North American between [Jesusland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesusland_map) and the United States of Canada tend to favor admission into the EU of a nation which is still mostly Allahland!

1 â€“ Of course overall the EU been an elite pushed project, and democratic sentiment has tended to give a rubber stamp to something which was already *fait accompli*. With Turkey though I think this is problematic because the chasm between the alcohol drinking secular elite and Christian missionary [throat cutting](http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=600732007) non-elites is pretty wide.
