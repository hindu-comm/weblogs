On words

Reading [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Rome-End-Civilization/dp/0192807285/ref=pd_sim_b_1/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&qid=1176865046&sr=8-2) made me a bit more curious about ‘the Dark Ages.’ So with that in mind I picked up [Europe after Rome: A New Cultural History 500-1000](https://www.amazon.com/Europe-after-Rome-Cultural-500-1000/dp/0199244278/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1177904595&sr=1-1). One page 29:

What does decline and fall mean if not the collapse of the social order? Well, it means many things. As [Daniel Larison](http://larison.org/) contended in response to [my previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/when-rome-fell.php) there was a problematic attitude amongst the older generation of classicists to idealize and world of Greece and Rome, as if nothing of greatness occurred between 476 and the Renaissance (an attitude that came to the fore, not surprisingly, during the Renaissance). So you have peculiar situations where authors can report an unending sequence of facts which suggest an epoch of relative material scarcity and decreased social complexity who just won’t admit that judged by these metrics there was a downsizing.

Update: Daniel Larison [has a response](http://larison.org/2007/04/30/gibbon-and-me). Let me be clear about one thing: I do not prefer diplomatic or institutional history. Nor do I shun it. But, I am curious as someone who wants to get the richest, most multi-dimensional, perception of the past, how the “small folk” lived.
