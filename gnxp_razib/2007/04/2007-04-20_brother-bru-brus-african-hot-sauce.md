Brother Bru-Bru’s African Hot Sauce

![bru.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/bru.jpg?resize=150%2C299)![bru.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/bru.jpg?resize=150%2C299)I was at the local food co-op when I saw [Brother Bru Bru’s African Hot Sauce](http://www.firegirl.com/hs1102.html). It said it was “very hot!” on the label, and since some of you had recommended African hot sauces to me earlier I decided to check it out. The label suggests that there were assorted peppers mixed into this concoction. Frankly, for me it was a bit on the mild side. Also, the background sweetness and pungency overwhelmed the heat. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the flavor, even if I was disappointed by tepid spice level. I’m giving it a 4 out of 10, mostly because this was way too mild for a “very hot!” sauce. I mean, the label advertises that it is peddling indigenous wisdom, and the cover has a bug-eyed black guy wearing a tribal necklace. It would have had to be real good to make up for the promises & kind of offensive marketing package, and it just didn’t step up.
