Why adaptive evolution is not evolution

Specifically, as [evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/12/why_accelerated_adaptive_evolu.php) points out the acceleration paper was focused on **adaptive evolution**, the subset of allele frequency changes driven predominantly by the force of natural selection. What’s the rest? Read the post.  
Why does this matter? **Evolution is a science**, and in science this sort of pedantic precision in definition, terminology and meaning matters a great deal because it is embedded in a contingent system. One of the most frustrating things about the necessity of the rearguard action against Creationists is that the “controversy” swamps this reality, that evolution is a science which is the process of refinement and change due to theoretical & empirical developments. Instead evolution is only discussed in the broadest generalities, which is an insight with might spark the imagination in the 19th century, but is now simply a background assumption which serves as the framework for the real action. Books such as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393050904/geneexpressio-20) are a necessary evil. Why evil? Because the time invested in the production of that prose could have been time devoted to research and (alas) grant writing.
