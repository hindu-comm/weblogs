KITLG makes you white skinned?

A few years ago, a new paper, [*SLC24A5*, a putative cation exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16357253&itool=iconabstr&query_hl=5), made some waves. It used zebrafish to elucidate the genetics of a locus, *SLC24A5*, which is responsible for 1/3 of the between population difference between Europeans and Africans in skin color. In short, Europeans are fixed for a derived variant, and Africans and East Asians for an ancestral one. Additionally, *SLC24A5* shows up in tests for very recent (last 10,000 years) selection, and is implicated in 1/3 of the skin color variation in South Asians. Today, a similar paper which focuses on *KITLG*, [*cis*-Regulatory Changes in *Kit Ligand* Expression and Parallel Evolution of Pigmentation in Sticklebacks and Humans](http://www.cell.com/content/article/fulltext?uid=PIIS0092867407014183):

> Here we use genetic crosses in sticklebacks to investigate the > parallel origin of pigmentation changes in natural populations…In > humans, Europeans and East Asians also share derived alleles at the > *KITLG* locus.

The authors show that *KITLG* is a QTL of major effect across a range of species in pigment variation, and explore the molecular genetics of why this might be in sticklebacks. They also note that in humans *KITLG* seems to be subject to selection in both Europeans and Africans. They used an African American population to explore *KITLG*‘s affect on skin color:

> Individuals with two African alleles (AA), one African and one > European allele (AG), or two European alleles (GG) show mean M index > scores of 55.2, 50.9, and 48.8, respectively. The regression > coefficient, β, representing the average amount the M index decreases > when one A allele is added to the model, is 3.8 melanin index units. > **Although these data suggest a model for the mode of inheritance that > is between an additive model and a dominant model, a much larger > sample size is needed to have sufficient statistical power to contrast > these models.**  
> …  
> The combined results suggest that replacement of two West African > alleles with two European alleles at the *KITLG* locus lightens a > person’s color by an average of 6to 7 melanin units. This compares > with an overall skin reflectance difference of approximately 30 > melanin units between West Africans and Europeans….

This isn’t the only affect of *KITLG* necessarily, like many pigmentation genes there are likely other affects:

Obviously I’ll be believe it when I see it when it comes to humans, but, we do know of one other affect of *KITLG*, “…a variant near *KITLG* is associated with hair color.” Specifically blonde vs. brown hair. **It seems that *KITLG* is like *OCA2*, there is a [influence on skin color variation](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/oca2-blue-eyes-and-skin-color.php), but also another trait** (in *OCA2*‘s case that’s eye color).
