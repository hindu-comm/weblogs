Malthus, innovation's friend?

Since [the previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/get-three-to-semiotics-department.php) was about the tendency toward radical skepticism and subjectivism within cultural anthropology, I thought I would point to [this piece](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10278703) in The Economist which highlights [positive insights](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10278703) from various anthropological fields. The article emphasizes the possible role that population pressure and the quest for food might have had in spurring human innovation, from the [atlatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlatl) to agriculture. An interesting point to note is the implicit suggestion that high rates of hunter-gatherer warfare might have constrained population pressure and possibly lead to relatively higher standards of living; something familiar from [Greg Clarkâ€™s model](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/08/10-questions-for-greg-clark.php). From a population genetic angle, I am curious as to whether the endemic warfare of cultures which were pre-state resulted in higher or lower [Nm](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecture-notes/mutation-drift/node4.html)\*?

\* N = population, m = migration rate. Nm \> 1 results in equilibration of allele frequencies across demes, while Nm \< 1 tends to lead to divergence.
