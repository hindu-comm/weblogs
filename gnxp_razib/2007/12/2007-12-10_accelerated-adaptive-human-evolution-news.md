Accelerated adaptive human evolution news

This [google news query](https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=harpending&btnG=Search+News) should get you to popular press articles. I’ll start putting links to blogs when more come in.  
**Blogs:** One of the lead authors, [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/acceleration_embargo_ends_2007.html), promises lots of commentary this week. [Greg Laden](http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2007/12/there_is_a_new_paper.php) has some questions regarding the demographic assumptions. [Steve Sailer](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2007/12/recent-acceleration-of-human-adaptive.html) with a round-up and [Linda Seebach](http://www.lindaseebach.net/wordpress/?p=37) offers the bigger picture. [p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/notes-on-evidence-for-acceleration.php) offers some pointed criticisms. [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/acceleration/acceleration_rarely_asked_questions_2007.html?seemore=y) does some rapid response. [Eric Wang and Henry Harpending](https://news.google.com/news?btcid=9ef52c86d6e6c898) offer specific comments. [John Hawks’ summary](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/acceleration/accel_story_2007.html?seemore=y) for lay people (long). [Shoshin](http://nyuanshin.livejournal.com/109773.html) goes over the theory too. [Popgen Ramblings](https://popgen-ramblings.blogspot.com/2007/12/why-simulations-are-important.html) says simulation is important. [p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/more-notes-on-acceleration.php) offers more “notes.” [Popgen Ramblings](https://popgen-ramblings.blogspot.com/2007/12/re-why-simulations-are-important.html) has another post up in response to a John Hawks comment..  
Quotes below from news articles….

  
[National Geographic:](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071211-human-evolution_2.html)

> More people mean more mutations, Harpending noted.  
> “You are also giving them the potential to be adaptive mutations,” > said Brian Verrelli, who studies population genetics and evolution at > Arizona State University in Tempe and was not involved in the > research.  
> Verrelli said the new study is interesting and accurately explains the > accelerated evolution with a plausible model based on demographics.  
> Importantly, he said, the research indicates that any speed-up in > evolution “had to have happened differently in different geographic > regions.”

[Haaretz](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/933180.html):

> “Ten thousand years ago, as men switched to an agricultural lifestyle, > their bodies began getting smaller, and along with their bodies, their > brains also decreased in size,” anthropologist John Hawks told > Haaretz. Hawks, who headed the team of researchers at Wisconsin, said > nutritional changes constituted one of the reasons – but not the only > one – behind the reduction in body size.  
> “Man himself has changed and become smaller,” Hawks said. At the same > time, the average height in the West began to grow during the past two > hundred years. However, Hawks attributes that to better nutrition, > rather than to genetic changes

[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/11/science/11gene.html?ref=science):

> The brisk rate of human selection occurred for two reasons, Dr. > Moyzis’ team says. One was that the population started to grow, first > in Africa and then in the rest of the world after the first modern > humans left Africa. The larger size of the population meant that there > were more mutations for natural selection to work on. The second > reason for the accelerated evolution was that the expanding human > populations in Africa and Eurasia were encountering climates and > diseases to which they had to adapt genetically. The extra mutations > in their growing populations allowed them to do so.  
> …  
> David Reich, a population geneticist at the Harvard Medical School, > said the new report was “a very interesting and exciting hypothesis” > but that the authors had not ruled out other explanations of the data. > The power of their test for selected genes falls off in looking both > at more ancient and more recent events, he said, so the overall > picture might not be correct.  
> Similar reservations were expressed by Jonathan Pritchard, a > population geneticist at the University of Chicago.  
> “My feeling is that they haven’t been cautious enough,” he said. “This > paper will probably stimulate others to study this question.”

[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071210213316.htm):

> “In evolutionary terms, cultures that grow slowly are at a > disadvantage, but the massive growth of human populations has led to > far more genetic mutations,” says Hawks. “And every mutation that is > advantageous to people has a chance of being selected and driven > toward fixation. What we are catching is an exceptional time.”

[Scientific American](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=culture-speeds-up-human-evolution):

> “Ten thousand years ago, no one on planet Earth had blue eyes,” Hawks > notes, because that gene–OCA2–had not yet developed. “We are different > from people who lived only 400 generations ago in ways that are very > obvious; that you can see with your eyes.”

[The AP](https://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ion0hzQBUeDy8DZsCeO8zHYWe4AAD8TERL4G0):

> Richard Potts, director of the human origins program at the > Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History, said he > thinks the researchers reasoning regarding rapid adaptive change is > plausible.  
> The study mainly points to an overall expansion in the human > population over the past 40,000 years to explain the genetic data.  
> “Yet the archaeological record also shows that humans increasingly > divided themselves into distinct cultures and migrating groups — > factors that seem to play only a small role in their analysis. > Dividing the human population into finer units and their movement into > new regions — the Arctic, Oceania, tropical forests, just to name some > — may have also forced quicker adaptive evolution in our species,” > Potts said.

[Reuters](http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnN10432286.html):

> Harpending said the genetic evidence shows that people worldwide have > been getting less similar rather than more similar due to the > relatively recent genetic changes.  
> Genes have evolved relatively quickly in Africa, Asia and Europe but > almost all of the changes have been unique to their corner of the > world. This is the case, he said, because since humans dispersed from > Africa to other parts of the world about 40,000 years ago, there has > not been much flow of genes between the regions.

[Wired](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/humans-evolving.html):

> In the study, researchers analzyed genomes from 270 people belonging > to four disparate ethnic groups: Han Chinese, Africa’s Yoruba tribe, > Japanese and Utah Mormons. By comparing areas of difference and > similarity, they determined that about seven percent of the genome has > undergone significant change since the end of the last Ice Age. “

[London Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3031104.ece):

> Armand Leroi, Reader in Evolutionary Biology at Imperial College, > London, said: “In principle, this could have led to speciation if it > had continued. In practice, it has got to be the case that that cannot > happen now. The reason is that this study has looked at largely > separated populations in the past, but everything about human history > since the Industrial Revolution weighs overwhelmingly against > separation and thus against speciation too. Huge increases in gene > flow are going to wipe this trend out.”

[Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=501170&in_page_id=1770):

> “We aren’t the same as people even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago,” he told > the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  
> “The dogma has been these are cultural fluctuations, but almost any > temperament trait you look at is under strong genetic influence.  
> “Human races are evolving away from each other. Genes are evolving > fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to > their continent of origin.

[Live Science](http://www.livescience.com/health/071210-faster-evolution.html):

> Our Stone Age ancestors were more genetically similar to Neanderthals > than they are to us, as our species has evolved 100 times faster in > the past 5,000 years than at any other time in human evolution, a new > study indicates.

[Science](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/1210/1):

> The findings are persuasive to anthropologist Clark Larsen of Ohio > State University in Columbus. But not everyone is on board. “I don’t > deny recent rapid selection,” says geneticist Kenneth Kidd of Yale > University. “But I am not yet convinced that so much rapid selection > at so many places in the genome has occurred. … I think we need much > more data.”

[Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-evolution11dec11,0,5882337.story?coll=la-home-center):

> Among the fastest-evolving genes are those related to brain > development, but the researchers aren’t sure what made them so > desirable, Hawks said.  
> There are other mysteries too.  
> “Nobody 10,000 years ago had blue eyes,” Hawks said. “Why is it that > blue-eyed people had a 5% advantage in reproducing compared to > non-blue-eyed people? I have no idea.”
