Evolution for Engineers

I received this email today:

Thanks for any suggestions.

The intersection between not high-level **and** focusing on engineering kind of made me scratch my head a bit. I went with these three in the response: [Adaptation and Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691026157/geneexpressio-20), [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192860925/geneexpressio-20) and [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/). I know that the correspondent stipulated that the work not be high level, but I think you can get a lot out of [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/) without following all the details of how R.A. Fisher derives his formalisms; much of the math is accessible to an advanced high school student. Do readers have better suggests with the constraints imposed above? I’m actually curious for myself in terms of what texts might be best in spreading the Adaptive News.  
**Note:** It might actually be good for engineers to see how evolution is constrained by contingent conditions (e.g., phylogenetic or developmental constraint) in many cases.
