Autism & yawning

[Absence of contagious yawning in children with autism spectrum disorder](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/3p06538k01256183/):

> This study is the first to report the disturbance of contagious > yawning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). > Twenty-four children with ASD as well as 25 age-matched typically > developing (TD) children observed video clips of either yawning or > control mouth movements. Yawning video clips elicited more yawns in TD > children than in children with ASD, but the frequency of yawns did not > differ between groups when they observed control video clips. > Moreover, TD children yawned more during or after the yawn video clips > than the control video clips, but the type of video clips did not > affect the amount of yawning in children with ASD. Current results > suggest that contagious yawning is impaired in ASD, which may relate > to their impairment in empathy. **It supports the claim that > contagious yawning is based on the capacity for empathy.**

Someone should do behavioral economics studies on groups of autistic individuals. Would surely validate the mid-20th century microeconomic consensus.
