My new blog about health, nutrition, and diet

Some readers here may already follow the food-related stuff I write about at my personal blog. Well, to allow myself to write more about diet, nutrition, and food in general, I’ve started a new blog called [Low Carb Art and Science](https://lowcarbartandscience.blogspot.com/). Lord knows there are already lots of blogs that deal with the topic, but this one will have lots more data and a stronger emphasis on evolution. But there will be plenty of less serious stuff and easy recipes too. Plus I’ll take an occasional interdisciplinary approach, as with an earlier post I wrote about [the late Medieval shift away from carbs and toward meat](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2009/05/late-medieval-shift-away-from-carbs-and.html).

The first post up is about [the changing American diet and poorer health](https://lowcarbartandscience.blogspot.com/2009/06/did-following-experts-diet-advice-make.html) — except that the graphs show that the changing American diet has been one that’s rigidly adhered to what the health experts tell us to eat. The data weren’t hard to find, analyze, and present, but I’ve never seen them before, let alone in a clear-to-see visual format. If you doubted whether the anti-meat, pro-grain message was being followed or not, and if so, whether it was making us healthier — this will be a real eye-opener. Take-home lesson: eat more saturated fat and cholesterol, and less carbohydrates.
