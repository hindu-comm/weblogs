Moderate levels of alcohol, good or bad?

[Alcohol’s Good for You? Some Scientists Doubt It](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/health/16alco.html?src=sch):

There are obvious issues with a randomized controlled clinical trial outlined in this article. The bigger issue seems to be that associations are overwhelming in the medical literature, and the way the media works in relation to health stories means that preliminary stuff gets way over-hyped very quickly.  
On the other hand, the article doesn’t mention [resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol) and red wine. I suspect that’s because at least there’s a plausible biochemical mechanism from animal studies in this particular case in addition to an association.
