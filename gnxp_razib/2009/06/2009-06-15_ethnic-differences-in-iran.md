Ethnic differences in Iran?

With the [Iranian election and the protests](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23IranElection) there are occasional references to ethnic groups in Iran. For example, [Mousavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir-Hossein_Mousavi) did not do as well in Azerbaijan as one would expect knowing that he is an ethnic Azeri Turk. The father of the [Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamneini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khameini) is also an Azeri Turk. So despite the fact that ethnic Persians, who speak Farsi, are the dominant group in Iran and to a large extent define its national identity, minorities have prominent roles. [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran#Demography) is about 50% Persian and 25% Azeri Turk, with the balance being defined by a host of other groups such as Kurds.  
But does this matter? The [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) done in 2005 in Iran had a breakdown by language. So one can examine to see if there are any differences between Azeri Turks and Persians. I didnâ€™t really find much at all. Below the fold are a a range of responses to various questions.
