Google books is great!

Mark Gimein [defends Google Books](http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/money-trail/2009/06/23/defense-google-books?page=full) over at *The Big Money*. New technology can be misused, but in general I tend to agree with Gimein. Along with [Amazon’s Search Inside](https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Book-Books/b?ie=UTF8&node=10197021) feature [Google Books](https://books.google.com/) is an excellent resource to look up and cross-reference obscure facts and data. With the utilization of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en#) you can even get a good sense of some books in languages you don’t know (I generally use this to make sure I understand the legend for a table or figure).
