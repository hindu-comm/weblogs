The ethics of blogging conferences

[Dan MacArthur of Genetics Future](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/on_the_challenges_of_conferenc.php) is at the [center of a minor controversy](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/06/cold-spring-har.html) because of his blogging [The Biology of Genomes](http://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings/genome09.shtml) conference. Realistically it seems updating pre-internet protocols is just a band-aid solution. And the issues aren’t particular to blogging conferences, they’re general to the ease and fluidity with which information can flow today.
