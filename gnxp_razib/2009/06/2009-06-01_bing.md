Bing

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/chandler-744671.jpg)Microsoft’s new search engine, [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), is live. And yeah, I think it’s kind of a [Google clone](http://education.zdnet.com/?p=2624). Where’s the differentiation? Then again, Microsoft did have a history of coming out with crappy clones and slowly perfecting and overtaking. WordPerfect, Lotus and Netscape. But the is not always prediction, and Microsoft had some advantages against those companies which it does not in the “Web 2.0” domain.
