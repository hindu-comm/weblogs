Evolution & monsters

[Darwin Killed Off The Werewolf](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090616080135.htm):

This is an interesting thesis. In light of the wide variation in acceptance of evolutionary theory it would be interesting to test this model in modern populations. Those which reject evolution should be more open to exotic chimeras than those who do not.
