Religion & social science intersection

I’ve been meaning to recommend [Epiphenom](https://bhascience.blogspot.com/) for a while. As its subheading, “at the intersection of science, atheism and humanism” indicates, it has a perspective. But the analysis of new papers suggests a rather light touch. Remember, this isn’t a blog which just opines about religion; rather, he analyzes **data** or analyzes the analysis of data. What’s not to like?
