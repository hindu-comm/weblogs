Fat and tuberculosis

[Obesity May Have Offered Edge Over TB](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/health/research/24fat.html?ref=health):

> Over the course of human evolution, people with excess stores of fat > have been more likely to survive famines, many scientists believe, > living on to pass their genes to the next generation.  
> But these days, obesity is thought to be harmful, leading to chronic > inflammation and metabolic disorders that set the stage for heart > disease. So what went awry? When did excess fat stop being a > protective mechanism that assured survival and instead become a > liability?  
> A provocative new hypothesis suggests that in some people, fat not > only stores energy but also revs up the body’s immune system. This > subgroup may have enjoyed a survival advantage in the 1800s, when > people were plagued by a disease that decimated Europe: tuberculosis.

The original paper is [here](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/301/24/2586). I’m skeptical, but I’d like people who know more about the history and distribution of tuberculosis to weigh in. My working assumption is that excess fat was helpful in most pre-modern contexts (i.e., female fertility) and obesity wasn’t common and simply a modern overshoot.
