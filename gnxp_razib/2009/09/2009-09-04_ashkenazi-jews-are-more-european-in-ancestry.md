Ashkenazi Jews are more European in ancestry

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/ashg-2009-abstracts.html) posted some abstracts of the ASHG 2009 meeting. This one is in the category of facts we assumed but weren’t totally sure of:

> *Abraham’s children in the genome era: Major Jewish Diaspora > populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle > Eastern ancestry*  
> Here, we present population structure results from compiled datasets > after merging with the Human Genome Diversity Project and the > Population Reference Sample studies, which consisted of 146 non-Jewish > Middle Easterners (Druze, Bedouin and Palestinian), 30 northern > Africans (Mozabite from Algeria), 1547 Europeans, and 653 individuals > from other African, Asian, Latin American, and Oceanian populations. > Both principal component analyses and multi-dimensional scaling > analysis of pairwise Fst distance show that Jewish populations form a > cluster clearly distinct from all major continental populations. The > results also reveal a finer population substructure in which each of 7 > Jewish populations studied here form distinctive clusters – **in each > instance within group Fst was smaller than between group**, although > some groups (Iranian, Iraqi) demonstrated greater within group > diversity and even sub-clusters, based on village of origin. By > pairwise Fst analysis, the Jewish groups are closest to Southern > Europeans (i.e. Tuscan Italians) and to Druze, Bedouins, Palestinians. > Interestingly, the distance to the closest Southern European > population follows the order from proximal to distal: Ashkenazi, > Sephardic, Syrian, Iraqi, and Iranian, which reflects historical > admixture with local communities. STRUCTURE results show that the > Jewish Diaspora groups all demonstrated Middle Eastern ancestry, but > varied significantly in the extent of European admixture. **There is > almost no European ancestry in Iranian and Iraqi Jews, whereas Syrian, > Sephardic, and Ashkenazi Jews have European admixture ranging from > 30%\~60%.** Analysis of identity-by-descent provides further insight > on recent and distinct history of such populations. These results > demonstrate the shared and distinctive genetic heritage of Jewish > Diaspora groups.

Remember that Fst is measuring variation, so more between group variation naturally indicates population substructure. The distinctiveness of Ashkenazi Jews is probably what I might term the “Iceland Effect”, no matter your original genetic profile shutting off gene flow for centuries will naturally result in a random walk into unique territory which can’t be explained simply as a combination of the founding population (in the case of Ashkenazi Jews I assume it was Middle Easterners and Europeans).
