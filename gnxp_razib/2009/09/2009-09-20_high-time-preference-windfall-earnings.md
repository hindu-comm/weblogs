High time preference & windfall earnings

[Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/nfl-player-bankruptcy.html) points me to [this article from last spring](http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Recession+or+no+recession,+many+NFL,+NBA+and+Major+League+-+03.23.09+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=406773612&fb=Y&url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153364/1/index.htm&partnerID=289881) about the profligacy of professional athletes. Here are numbers which seem constructed for the sake of plausibility more than anything else:

> \* By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL > players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress because of > joblessness or divorce. >
> \* Within five years of retirement, an estimated 60% of former NBA > players are broke.

It shouldn’t be that hard to track down a large number of former players and try and make the sample representative, and assess what their financial situation is. This looks like a “natural experiment” waiting to be mined for data (perhaps someone already has, if so, pointers in the comments welcome). Here’s the part which shows time preference inclinations most starkly:

> Given all the pressures on a pro athlete’s marriage, one safety valve > might be the prenuptial agreement-something “very strongly” > recommended by agent David Falk, who surged to prominence representing > Michael Jordan (who did not have one). **“The percentage of prenups > amongst athletes is appreciably lower compared with nonathletes at the > same economic level,”** says celebrity divorce lawyer Raoul Felder, > who has represented the ex-wives of Patrick Ewing, Jason Kidd and Mike > Tyson. >
> In 1994, when NBA center Dikembe Mutombo was engaged to Michelle > Roberts, a med student, Roberts refused to sign a premarital contract > the day before the wedding. Five hundred guests-including a large > party from Mutombo’s native Democratic Republic of Congo-had begun > flying in to Washington. “\[Roberts\] never signed,” Falk says, “and > Mutombo never married the girl.” Calling off the nuptials reportedly > cost him \$250,000. >
> It’s no coincidence that the woman a pro athlete often chooses to > marry-and often at a young age-is his hometown sweetheart. For that > reason he can’t envision a ruinous divorce. “That was how you could > tell if she really liked you, if she knew you before you made it,” > says West. But when a player does make it? “The question \[for the > athlete\] becomes, When you get off the farm and see Paris, so to > speak, can you really go back to the farm?” >
> Children almost always complicate the issue. **How to limit paternity > obligations is a challenge for pro athletes.** Former NBA forward > Shawn Kemp (who has at least seven children by six women) and, more > recently, Travis Henry (nine by nine) have seen their fortunes sapped > by monthly child-support payments in the tens of thousands of dollars. > Last month Henry, who reportedly earned almost \$11 million over seven > years in the NFL, tried and failed to temporarily reduce one of his > nine child-support payments by arguing that he could no longer afford > the \$3,000 every month. Two weeks later he was jailed for falling > \$16,600 behind in payments for his child in Frostproof, Fla.

Mutumbo as an exceptional case is informative, he was not recruited as a [student athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikembe_Mutombo#College) initially, and managed to complete a degree in linguistics and diplomacy at Georgetown ([David Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robinson_(basketball)#Early_life), who scored a 1320 on the pre-recentered SAT and received a degree in math from the Naval Academy, is probably an even better example).
