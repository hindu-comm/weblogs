Religion & cognitive neuroscience

Obviously these sorts of studies need to be viewed skeptically, the intersection of religion & [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging#Disadvantages_of_fMRI) seems very biased toward a high level of “sexiness.” Nevertheless, there are dozens of books on the psychology of religion, and, we know that religiosity is moderately heritable, so at some point the cognitive neuroscientists need to get in on the game of normal human variation in religious orientation (as opposed to studies of mystical brain states which seem focused on outliers). Here’s the conclusion, which takes some sides in long festering arguments about the evolutionary origins of religion:

> This study is correlational; therefore, it does not imply causality. > Moreover, it was performed in adults. Subjects may have been > predisposed to follow specific patterns of religious behavior by their > individual brain development or their religious behavior may have > contributed to volume changes of certain brain areas. Regardless, the > fact that there is no brain area correlating with religiosity of > upbringing (PC2) argues against religious nurture independently > accounting for regional brain variability. Therefore, religiosity in > adult life may reflect innate “susceptibilities”, perhaps genetic or > early developmental, which are non-modifiable during upbringing, or > any initial effect of religious upbringing may be dissipated by > experiences in later life.  
> The brain areas identified in this and the parallel fMRI studies are > not unique to processing religion, but play major roles in social > cognition. **This implies that religious beliefs and behavior emerged > not as sui generis evolutionary adaptations,** but as an extension > (some would say “by product”) of social cognition and behavior. > Furthermore, the current study suggests that evolution of certain > areas that advanced understanding and empathy towards our fellow human > beings (such as BA 7, 11 and 21) may, at the same time, have allowed > for a relationship with a perceived supernatural agent (God) based on > intimacy rather than fear. The idea that how you relate to “thy God” > parallels how you behave to “thy neighbor” is a long-cherished claim > of many religions (and is backed by some empirical evidence…In this > study, we see that this link is elaborated in the cognitive and neural > foundations of religion.
