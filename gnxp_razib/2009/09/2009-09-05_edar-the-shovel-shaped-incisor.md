EDAR & the shovel-shaped incisor

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/more-ashg-2009-abstracts.html) is posting more ASHG abstracts. This one is interesting:

> **A nonsynonymous SNP in EDAR is associated with tooth shoveling** >
> Teeth display variations among individuals in the size and the shape > of cusps, ridges, grooves, and roots. In addition, there are certain > dental characteristics which are predominant in certain human groups, > such as tooth shoveling of upper incisors that is major in Asian > populations but rare or absent in African and European > populations…Human genome diversity data have revealed that the derived > allele of a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), > rs3827760 that is also called EDAR T1540C, is predominant in East > Asian populations but absent in populations of African and European > origins. It has recently been reported that the 1540C allele is > associated with Asian-specific hair thickness. The aim of this study > is to clarify whether the nonsynonymous polymorphism in EDAR is also > associated with dental morphology in humans or not. For this purpose, > we measured crown diameters and tooth shoveling grades, genotyped EDAR > T1540C, and analyzed the correlations between them in Japanese > populations. To comprehend individual patterns of dental morphology, > we applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to individual-level > metric data, the result of which implies that multiple types of > factors affect the tooth size. **This study clearly demonstrated that > the number of the Asian-specific EDAR 1540C allele is strongly > correlated with the tooth shoveling grade.**

We’ve [posted on *EDAR*](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=edar&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com). Interesting that it seems it is related to another classic “Mongoloid” physical trait, the shovel-shaped incisor, which loomed large back in the day when bones and teeth were the way you identified remains. Of course, [other ancient populations had shovel-shaped incisors](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/anthro/programs/csho/Content/Facultycvandinfo/Bailey/Bailey%202006%20Periodicum%20Biologorum.pdf), so it isn’t as if this is totally unique to the peoples of East Asia and the Americas. In any case, this shouldn’t be too surprising, *EDAR* does a lot of things, as evident by the summary in [GeneCards](http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=Edar):

> This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor > family. The encoded transmembrane protein is a receptor for the > soluble ligand ectodysplasin A, and can activate the nuclear > factor-kappaB, JNK, and caspase-independent cell death pathways. It is > required for the development of **hair, teeth**, and other ectodermal > derivatives. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant and > recessive forms of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
