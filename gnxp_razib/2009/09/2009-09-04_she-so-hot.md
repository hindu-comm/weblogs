She So Hot

[Interacting with women can impair men’s cognitive functioning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJB-4W99W49-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=16698184135f0394ea1575f2f6e4a886):

> The present research tested the prediction that mixed-sex interactions > may temporarily impair cognitive functioning. Two studies, in which > participants interacted either with a same-sex or opposite-sex other, > **demonstrated that men’s (but not women’s) cognitive performance > declined following a mixed-sex encounter. In line with our theoretical > reasoning, this effect occurred more strongly to the extent that the > opposite-sex other was perceived as more attractive** (Study 1), and > to the extent that participants reported higher levels of impression > management motivation (Study 2). Implications for the general role of > interpersonal processes in cognitive functioning, and some practical > implications, are discussed.

Everything fits intuition, right?
