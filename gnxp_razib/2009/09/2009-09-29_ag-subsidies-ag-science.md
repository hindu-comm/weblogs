Ag subsidies + ag science = :-(

[From Science, Plenty of Cows but Little Profit](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/business/29dairy.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

From what I know the market for these sorts of products has framed by a lot of subsidies and incentives. Increased productivity through better science should be good for any industry, but here you go slaughtering cattle to reduce production and keep the prices up. OPEC is simple compared to this. These sorts of policies are only practical because we live in a world of surplus food production.
