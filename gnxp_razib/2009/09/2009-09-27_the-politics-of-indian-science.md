The politics of Indian science

A geologist, Suvrat Kher, has a [very good post](https://suvratk.blogspot.com/2009/09/genetic-ancestry-of-indians-new-paper.html) on the recent paper on Indian genetics. He concludes:

> The Indian Press has made a hash of the finding. For example they have > only reported those parts of the study that deal with the kinship > among Indians and have stressed that castes and tribes cannot be > differentiated or that there is no divide between the Aryans (roughly > north Indians) and Dravidians (south Indians). That is all true for > average relatedness. But the study also clearly points out that there > are genetic differences between north and south Indians and between > upper and lower caste in terms of the degree of relatedness to > Eurasians. North Indians and upper castes are more closely related to > Eurasians. North Indian upper castes have even more Eurasian ancestry. > This part was ignored by the press.  
> But I can’t blame the press entirely. The scientists who gave > interviews to the press didn’t mention this. They wimped out on > reporting this potential inflammatory and politically incorrect > finding. This is just poor and irresponsible science outreach on part > of the scientists. How can you ignore a finding that is staring out at > you from the very paper you are talking about? The press may be guilty > of not digging in but it was just reporting what the scientists told > them.

I’ve recoded so that Indo-European (“Aryan”) and Dravidian speaking groups are blue & red respectively. They overlap, but there is clearly an average between group difference.  
Sometimes people will see what they want to see. It reminds me of a post I put up years ago that some Jewish groups, like non-Ashkenazi from the former Uzbekistan, don’t really fit into the “Sephardic-Ashkenazi” dichotomy. Nevertheless, the **first comment** on the post asked if these Jews were Sephardic or Ashkenazi!
