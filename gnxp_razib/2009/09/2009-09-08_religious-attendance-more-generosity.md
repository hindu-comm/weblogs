Religious attendance = more generosity

[Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide](http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/Religious-Attendance-Relates-Generosity-Worldwide.aspx):

> Gallup data reveal that adherents of all the major world religions who > attended religious services (attenders) in the past week have higher > rates of generosity than do their coreligionists who did not attend > services (non-attenders). Even for individuals who do not affiliate > with any religious tradition, those who said they attended religious > services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.  
> These findings are based on Gallup surveys conducted from 2005-2009 in > 145 countries, which asked individuals about whether they in the past > month donated money to a charity, volunteered time to an organization, > and helped a stranger.

Religion is many things. One of those things is an institutional framework which allows for collective action and communal participation by individuals. Religious institutions seem particularly robust, far more robust than the beliefs which are associated with religious institutions at any given time.
