The contingent history of science

[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/randomness-of-model-organisms.php) points out that [selection of model organisms](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/randomness-of-model-organisms.php) can shape the path of scientific research because of the very nature of model organisms. Normative considerations in science are pretty obvious when you look at the set of disciplines; thereâ€™s a whole field of biological anthropology which studies one species. There is the rather well known case that doctoral research arcs are constrained to a relatively short period, which resulted in a focus short-lived organisms in zoological studies. Imagine trying to write up grant applications focusing on the life history of the [tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise#Lifespan).
