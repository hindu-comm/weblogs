Sex hormones & genes

[Quantitative trait loci predicting circulating sex steroid hormones in men from the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3)](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/18/19/3749?rss=1):

> Twin studies suggest a heritable component to circulating sex steroid > hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In the NCI-Breast > and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, 874 SNPs in 37 candidate genes > in the sex steroid hormone pathway were examined in relation to > circulating levels of SHBG (N = 4720), testosterone (N = 4678), > 3-androstanediol-glucuronide (N = 4767) and 17Î²-estradiol (N = 2014) > in Caucasian men. rs1799941 in SHBG is highly significantly associated > with circulating levels of SHBG (P = 4.52 x 10â€“21), consistent with > previous studies, and testosterone (P = 7.54 x 10â€“15), with mean > difference of 26.9 and 14.3%, respectively, comparing wild-type to > homozygous variant carriers. **Further noteworthy novel findings were > observed between SNPs in *ESR1 with testosterone levels* (rs722208, > mean difference = 8.8%, P = 7.37 x 10â€“6) and SRD5A2 with > 3-androstanediol-glucuronide (rs2208532, mean difference = 11.8%, P = > 1.82 x 10â€“6).** Genetic variation in genes in the sex steroid > hormone pathway is associated with differences in circulating SHBG and > sex steroid hormones.
