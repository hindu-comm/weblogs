Lost World, 2009

The story about the [giant rat](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8210000/8210394.stm) discovered in an isolated crater in Papua New Guinea is fascinating. It’s kind of atypical in these days, but if you read through really old copies of *National Geographic* from the early 20th century it you observe that it occurred all the time back then. I would of course much rather live now at the turn of the 21st century than the turn of the 20th, but there’s a certain amount of zoological and anthropological wonder that we’ll not be able to attain because so much of the sample space of possibilities has been mapped out.
