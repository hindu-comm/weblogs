Eurasian books

At my other weblog, two reviews of books on Eurasia. First, [Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/whos-barbarian-now-empires-of-silk-road.php). Second, [Chinaâ€™s Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/when-china-contained-world.php).
