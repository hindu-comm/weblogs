Social capital ∝ to religion? (or not?)

[Does secularization of the USA spell social meltdown?](https://bhascience.blogspot.com/2009/05/does-secularization-of-usa-spell-social.html):

I think the last sentence is way too strong. The problem with these research programs is that people have strong preferences on what the outcomes should be based on their normative framework. That is, whether you accept the truth claims of religion or not should have no necessary bearing on whether you accept or reject hypotheses in regards to religion’s social utility, but operationally there are clear trends. Because of the nature of social science it isn’t too hard to keep looking for the research which just happens to support your particular preferences. I suspect that arguments to the effect that *only* within nation comparisons are useful, or, that between nation comparisons are useful, will track the preferences much more closely than any *a priori* methodological bias. There is much more will to support particular conclusions than to be cautious about teasing apart social parameters.  
In any case, in the United States it is rather clear that [distance from Canada](https://books.google.com/books?id=hT_ELDzB99gC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=canada+moynihan+distance&source=bl&ots=PrC_4p68Te&sig=gNQmPpDFMpJu_8jLfGybgJ0Ngbs&hl=en&ei=e2EPSq_KCaiGtgOz_dCFAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1) is the primary variable when it comes to social capital formation.
