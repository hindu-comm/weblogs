Optimism across the world

I suspect that a sunny outlook isn’t just relevant in a cross-country sense. Without optimism where would all the entrepreneurs be? Would anyone start a new restaurant? Optimism helps people think they’ll beat the odds in a risky proposition. Though there’s some interpersonal variation in risk aversion, I suspect that there isn’t enough to explain the types of people who repeatedly enter into very low probability of success, though high reward, activities. And these very activities are often the motors behind economic growth through positive externalities.
