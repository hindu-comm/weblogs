Eczema & asthma

[Skin-Derived TSLP Triggers Progression from Epidermal-Barrier Defects to Asthma](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000067):

> Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a common allergic skin inflammation that > has a particularly high prevalence among children. Importantly, a > large proportion of people suffering from eczema go on to develop > asthma later in life. Although the susceptibility of eczema patients > to asthma is well documented, the mechanism that mediates “atopic > march”- the progression from eczema to asthma – is unclear. We used > genetic engineering to generate mice with chronic skin-barrier defects > and a subsequent eczema-like disorder. With these mice, we were able > to investigate how skin-specific defects predisposed the lungs to > allergic asthma. We identified thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a > cytokine that is secreted by barrier-defective skin into the systemic > circulation, as the agent sensitizing the lung to allergens. We > demonstrated that high systemic levels of skin-derived TSLP were both > required and sufficient to render lung airways hypersensitive to > allergens. Thus, these data suggest that early treatment of > skin-barrier defects to prevent TSLP overexpression, and systemic > inhibition of TSLP, may be crucial in preventing the progression from > eczema to asthma.
