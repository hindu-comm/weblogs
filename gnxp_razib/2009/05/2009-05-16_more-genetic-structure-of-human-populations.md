More genetic structure of human populations

[Genome-wide Insights into the Patterns and Determinants of Fine-Scale Population Structure in Humans](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00157-8):

> Studying genomic patterns of human population structure provides > important insights into human evolutionary history and the > relationship among populations, and it has significant practical > implications for disease-gene mapping. Here we describe a principal > component (PC)-based approach to studying intracontinental population > structure in humans, identify the underlying markers mediating the > observed patterns of fine-scale population structure, and infer the > predominating evolutionary forces shaping local population structure. > We applied this methodology to a data set of 650K SNPs genotyped in > 944 unrelated individuals from 52 populations and demonstrate that, > although typical PC analyses focus on the top axes of variation, > substantial information about population structure is contained in > lower-ranked PCs. We identified 18 significant PCs, some of which > distinguish individual populations. In addition to visually > representing sample clusters in PC biplots, we estimated the set of > all SNPs significantly correlated with each of the most informative > axes of variation. These polymorphisms, unlike ancestry-informative > markers (AIMs), constitute a much larger set of loci that drive > genomic signatures of population structure. The genome-wide > distribution of these significantly correlated markers can largely be > accounted for by the stochastic effects of genetic drift, although > significant clustering does occur in genomic regions that have been > previously implicated as targets of recent adaptive evolution.

Seems ho-hum. [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/05/fine-scale-population-structure-in.html) has some comments.
