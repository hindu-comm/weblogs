The "future" of the American automotive industry

*BusinessWeek*, [The Tough Road Ahead for GM and Chrysler](http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/09_23/b4134028500365.htm):

I was skeptical of the bailout last fall because I assumed bankruptcy was inevitable. Of course I don’t know much about the automotive industry, but numbers like those above aren’t hard to find. It seems likely that the government knew that a bankruptcy was coming anyway, so the whole song & dance about the bridge loans were going to make the companies viable was kind of weird, though perhaps there’s some “animal spirits” rationale for the soft landing….
