Psychology's lack of utility to economics

[Will of Ambrosini Critique](http://www.ambrosini.us/wordpress/2009/04/psychologyeconomicsphysicschemistry/) [makes the case](http://www.ambrosini.us/wordpress/2009/04/psychologyeconomicsphysicschemistry/). I actually don’t accept the contention that chemistry is more intuitive than physics (physics can mean a lot of things, some of which can be demonstrated with balls, and mixing random chemicals together and trying to understand it intuitively has generally led alchemy, not chemistry), but that’s not really the point. The post seems prompted by a discussion of Daniel Ariely’s [*Predictably Irrational*](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/04/predictably_irrational_behavio.php) at my other weblog.
