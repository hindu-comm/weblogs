On Financial Foolishness

Check out this [Felix Salmon’s interview](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/05/18/the-full-gillian-tett-interview/) (video) with Gillian Tett, author of [Fool’s Gold: How the Bold Dream of a Small Tribe at J.P. Morgan Was Corrupted by Wall Street Greed and Unleashed a Catastrophe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/141659857X/geneexpressio-20) (the reference to “Tribe” is a wink to Tett’s background as an anthropologist). Also, she was [recently on NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104130944).
