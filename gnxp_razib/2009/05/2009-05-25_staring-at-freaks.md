Staring at "freaks"

[Why We Stare, Even When We Don’t Want To](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/05/freaks/):

> “When a face is distorted, we have no pattern to match that,” > Rosenberg said. “All primates show this \[staring\] at something very > different, something they have not evolved to see. They need to > investigate further. ‘Are they one of us or not?’ In other species, > when an animal looks very different, they get rejected.”  
> And so, we stare. (An averted gaze is triggered in some people. This > too can be overridden only with great difficulty.)  
> **It doesn’t take much of a facial anomaly to trigger a transfixed > response; a normal human face upside down will do it. Or one that is > simply unmoving.**  
> In her work with Paul Ekman, who pioneered the widely accepted theory > that human emotion conveyed via facial expressions is biological in > origin, Rosenberg studied a group of people with a condition that > prevents their facial muscles from moving.  
> “They talk about how difficult it is to interact with people because > people can’t handle looking at a face that doesn’t move,” Rosenberg > said.
