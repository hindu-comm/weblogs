Evolution & the cat

*Scientific American* has a [long piece](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taming-of-the-cat&print=true) reviewing the recent genetic insights into the origins and development of the most awesome pets of all:

> It is by turns aloof and affectionate, serene and savage, endearing > and exasperating. Despite its mercurial nature, however, the house cat > is the most popular pet in the world. A third of American households > have feline members, and more than 600 million cats live among humans > worldwide. Yet as familiar as these creatures are, a complete > understanding of their origins has proved elusive. Whereas other once > wild animals were domesticated for their milk, meat, wool or servile > labor, cats contribute virtually nothing in the way of sustenance or > work to human endeavor. How, then, did they become commonplace > fixtures in our homes?  
> Scholars long believed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to > keep cats as pets, starting around 3,600 years ago. But genetic and > archaeological discoveries made over the past five years have revised > this scenario–and have generated fresh insights into both the ancestry > of the house cat and how its relationship with humans evolved.

This part on the look of modern cats was surprising to me:

> Although humans might have played some minor role in the development > of the natural breeds in the Orient, concerted efforts to produce > novel breeds did not begin until relatively recently. Even the > Egyptians, who we know were breeding cats extensively, do not seem to > have been selecting for visible traits, probably because distinctive > variants had not yet arisen: in their paintings, both wildcats and > house cats are depicted as having the same mackerel-tabby coat. > Experts believe that most of the modern breeds were developed in the > British Isles in the 19th century, based on the writings of English > natural history artist Harrison Weir. And in 1871 the first proper > fancy cat breeds–breeds created by humans to achieve a particular > appearance–were displayed at a cat show held at the Crystal Palace in > London (a Persian won, although the Siamese was a sensation).
