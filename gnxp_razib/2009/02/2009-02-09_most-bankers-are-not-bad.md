Most bankers are not bad

Jacob Weisberg has a good corrective to anti-banking hysteria, [The Case for Bankers](http://www.slate.com/id/2210720/). My post below, Kill the traders!, was an indictment of a small minority who have an outsized effect on the majority. We’re talking a [power law distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), most of the havoc is due to a few. Weisberg notes:

> If you want to sputter, choke, and turn purple with rage at the people > who wrecked your retirement, you might start with Cramer himself, the > most prolific dispenser of bad advice to the investing public. But if > you’re looking for someone in the securities industry, you’d be > justified in directing your outrage at Joseph Cassano, who ran the > London-based AIG Financial Products subsidiary. As explained in a > superb New York Times piece last fall, his 377-employee unit issued > \$500 billion in credit-default swaps–insurance against default on > mortgage-backed securities. Losses on these once wildly profitable > instruments led to collateral calls that undermined AIG’s credit > rating and thereby threatened the global financial system so seriously > that the Fed had to step in. **But even if you assume every one of > those 377 employees in that London office…you’re looking at less than > 1 percent of the firm’s 116,000 employees spread among 130 > countries.**

If a few hundred employees can cause such chaos, the system is clearly not robust. All that being said, I think it is important to remember that Weisberg helped write Robert Rubin’s memoir, [In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375757309/geneexpressio-20/). This might give him a bit more sympathy than the typical journalist when it comes to bankers. It is also notable that [Rubin’s reputation has greatly suffered recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin#Economic_record_and_the_2008_global_financial_crisis).
