Darwin, still relevant

Nick Wade’s [Darwin, Ahead of His Time, Is Still Influential](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/science/10evolution.html?ref=science&pagewanted=print) is a good complement to the strained Darwin-skepticism I pointed to earlier. From the perspective of this weblog this comment was interesting:

> Darwin is still far from being fully accepted in sciences outside > biology. “People say natural selection is O.K. for human bodies but > not for brain or behavior,” Dr. Cronin says. “But making an exception > for one species is to deny Darwin’s tenet of understanding all living > things. This includes almost the whole of social studies — that’s > quite an influential body that’s still rejecting Darwinism.”
