"Smoking related" anti-sociality heritable, not environment?

I guess that’s what economists would call a “natural experiment.” In any case, these results are in light with the sort of arguments [Judith Rich Harris](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-judith-rich-harris.php) lays out in her [books](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/04/no-two-alike-role-of-noise.php). Much of the correlation we see behaviorally between parents and children actually being genetic, even though we have prior assumptions as to the importance of socialization in the behaviors in question. Here’s the primary figure:

From the results:

The data show that mothers who smoked in the sample tended to have anti-social offspring. There was a correlation. But when broken down by relatedness the data showed that the effect existed among related mothers and offspring, but not unrelated. The inference then is that the smoking-anti-sociality likely had more to do with personality traits in women who would smoke while pregnant, and who would pass those personality traits to their offspring.

**Addendum:** What kind of maniac would go through in vitro **and then smoke!** Just sayin’.
