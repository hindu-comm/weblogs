Human CCR5 knockout

[This](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/360/7/692) is a pretty nice little story: a man enters a clinic with leukemia and HIV, gets a bone marrow transplant from a donor homozygous for [the CCR5 deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432) (these individuals are largely resistant to HIV infection), and ends up no longer needing anti-retroviral therapy.

It’s just a single patient, and I somehow doubt this is a viable option for HIV treatment, but still, this is pretty impressive:

> In our patient, transplantation led to complete chimerism, and the > patient’s peripheral-blood monocytes changed from a heterozygous to a > homozygous genotype regarding the CCR5 delta32 allele. **Although the > patient had nonâ€“CCR5-tropic X4 variants and HAART was discontinued > for more than 20 months, HIV-1 virus could not be detected in > peripheral blood, bone marrow, or rectal mucosa,** as assessed with > RNA and proviral DNA PCR assays. For as long as the viral load > continues to be undetectable, this patient will not require > antiretroviral therapy.
