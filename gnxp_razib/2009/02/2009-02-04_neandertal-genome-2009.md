Neandertal genome 2009

[John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/node/1841) notes that [Neandertal genome in one week’s time?](http://johnhawks.net/node/1841) I saw Svante Paabo speak in the fall and he said he was trying to get this out early in 2009, but he didn’t clue us in to any surprises. Rather, he seemed to indicate that there would simply be greater precision on what he already had reported.
