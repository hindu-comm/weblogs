Job numbers, real vs. relative

One of the things that really irritates me is when people throw around numbers without normalization. This is a major behavioral economic issue, Robert Shiller suggests that the inability to tell the [difference between nominal & real values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)) is one of the major reasons the American public was convinced that real estate was a “sure thing” investment. People confused the nominal rise in housing values with real increases, and didn’t have an intuitive sense how [weird the last 10 years were](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Case-shiller-index-values.jpg) in the long-term perspective. In any case, [Calculated Risk](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/02/job-losses-during-recessons.html) has a post on [Job Losses During Recessions](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/02/job-losses-during-recessons.html), with two important charts:
