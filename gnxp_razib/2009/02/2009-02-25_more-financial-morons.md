More Financial Morons

Mark Chu-Carroll has an excellent smack-down, [Financial Morons, and Quadratics vs. Linears](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/financial_morons_and_quadratic.php). Mark notes:

What Mark is pointing to is a pretty clear cognitive bias in terms of how we humans take in quantitative data presented in graphical form. You don’t have to be a moron, you just have to be processing on the the reflexive and implicit cognitive level. Here’s the problem: **people were being paid *a lot* of money because of their presumed ability to extract themselves out of their animal milieu and operate as rational actors who engaged in reflective analysis.** There’s not that much value-add in gut-level intuition. Below the fold is a commercial that anyone who has worked with MBAs might find amusing.
