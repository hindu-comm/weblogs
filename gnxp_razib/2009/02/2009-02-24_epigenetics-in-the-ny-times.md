Epigenetics in the NY Times

Not news to many readers, I’m sure, but Nicholas Wade has [a nice article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/science/24chromatin.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=science) on epigenetics and gene regulation. Some people in the article complain about the lack of a focused investment by the government in this area. I found this a little odd–isn’t quite a bit of large-scale work being done by the [ENCODE project](http://www.genome.gov/10005107)?
