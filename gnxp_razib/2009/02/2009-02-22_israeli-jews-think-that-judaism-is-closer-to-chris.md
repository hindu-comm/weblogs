Israeli Jews think that Judaism is closer to Christianity

In light of my [previous comments on Judeo-Christianity](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=judeo-christianity+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search), here is a [interesting survey](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1065667.html) about Israeli Jewish views of other religions, in particular Christianity. Some results:

  
\* 41% believe that Christianity is closest religion to Judaism  
\* 32% believe than Islam is closest religion to Judaism  
\* 50% agreed that Jerusalem was central to the Christian faith  
\* 75% percent believe the state should not allow Christian organizations to purchase land to construct new churches in the city (the state or state-sanctioned organizations own most land in Israel)  
\* 80% of secular Jews believe it is acceptable to visit churches, and many have visited churches abroad  
\* 17% of religious Jews believe it is acceptable to visit churches  
\* 78% of religious Jews believe that Christianity is “idol worship”  
\* 44% (or less) of secular Jews believe that Christianity is “idol worship”  
\* 56% of secular Jews believe that a Christian in the IDF should be allowed to swear on the New Testament  
\* 38% (or less) of religious Jews believe that a Christian in the IDF should be allowed to swear on the New Testament  
Some of the data here is worded strangely because the original article states that “62 percent of religious Jews think only the Torah should be used.” I decided to subtract from 100 and amalgamate various other responses (I assume there was a “No opinion” option) for ease of comparison. Israeli Hebrew speaking readers might check out [this website](http://www.jiis.org.il/) to see if the original report is online…I couldn’t find it in the English speaking section. Additionally, in terms of closeness to Islam or Christianity, I am willing to hazard that **religious Jews are more likely to agree that Islam is closer than secular Jews**. I say this because a bit more than half of Jews in Israel are secular, last I checked, so if they are much more likely to aver an affinity to Christianity that would explain the plural majority. And, I am skeptical that religious Jews would say that their religion is closer to Christianity if such a high number believe that Christianity is idol worship.
