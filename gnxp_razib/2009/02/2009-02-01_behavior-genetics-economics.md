Behavior genetics + economics = ?

A week ago I posted [MAOA, aggression and behavioral economics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/01/maoa-aggression-and-behavioral.php). In a related vein, I thought I would point again to [Genetic Variation in Preferences for Giving and Risk-Taking](http://econ-www.mit.edu/files/3189) (see Herricks’ [post on this last fall](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/09/altruism-and-risk-taking-kinda.php)). From the conclusion:

> In this paper, we have presented an empirical investigation into the > relative contributions of individual differences in genes an > environment to observed variation in economic preferences for risk and > giving…While our results do not allow us to be as assertive as Sir > Francis Galton, they do suggest that humans are endowed with genetic > variation in their proclivity to donate money to charity and to take > risks. By now there is a plethora of studies exploring th sources of > individual variation in economic experiments and games, yet up until > recently considerations of genetic influences have remained relativel > absent. Here we have argued that this failure to consider genes > obscures an important source of preference heterogeneity. Ultimately, > we hope that a better understanding of the underlying individual > genetic heterogeneity…in economic preferences, and the adaptive > pressures under which these preferences evolved will lead to a more > comprehensive economic science that can bridge some of the unexplained > gaps between empirical data and economic theory….

You can read the whole paper at the link provided. The paper mentions the [AVRP1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine_vasopressin_receptor_1A) gene’s association with [variation in the dictator game](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/12/avpr1a_polymorphism_tied_to_va.php). Of course, variation on this locus has [many correlates](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/09/they_fk_you_up_your_genesavpr1.php), so I’m sure that the [dopamine receptor related genes](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/optimal-personality-and-way-of-life.php) will also pop-up in the behavior economic literature soon enough. Get a big enough alphabet soup of genes, and perhaps we can go from talking about behavioral genetics & economics, to behavioral & economic genomics. I’m betting this game will resemble the genetic architecture of [skin color](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=skin+color&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) more than [IQ](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/massive-qtl-for-iq-discovered.php) or [height](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/09/why_you_be_short_or_tall_well.php). Note how some of these loci show up over & over again in the literature, in different disciplinary contexts & behavioral phenotypes.
