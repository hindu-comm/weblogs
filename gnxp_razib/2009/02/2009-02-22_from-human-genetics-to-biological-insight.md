From human genetics to biological insight

In 2007, SNPs in an intron of the gene FTO were [reported to be associated with obesity](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/316/5826/889). At the time, essentially nothing was known about the gene. A few months later, a group of biochemists [proposed a role](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/from-genetics-to-biochemistry.php) for the gene in demethylation of nucleic acids (RNA or DNA). This week, a group of mouse geneticists present [an analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature07848.html) of a knockout of the gene, and show that the knockouts are resistant to weight gain due to increased energy expenditure.

There’s still quite a ways to go before the mechanism by which FTO contributes to weight variation in humans is understood (oddly enough, there’s [some evidence](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/359/24/2558) that the mechanism is through increased energy *intake* rather than expenditure), but people keep chipping away…
