Younger people accept evolution

[The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/02/age-and-accepting-evolution.html) has already reported that younger people are more likely to accept evolution. But it is also true that [younger people are less Christian](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&BarnaUpdateID=280) than older people. But does the trend hold within religious groups? That is, are younger people more open to evolution, or is that more secular people are more open to evolution and younger people are more secular? I decided to check Protestants and Catholics in the GSS broken down into three age brackets, 18-35, 36-50 and 51+ (the sample sizes are decent). I used the SCITEST4 variable, affirmative or not for “Humans evolved from animals.” I also checked for those individuals in the sample who believe that “God Definitely Exists.”

I looks like there’s some foundation to optimism here….
