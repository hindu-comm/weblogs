Right & wrong is not about religion

At least according to most Americans. The [full report](https://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf) of the Pew [Religious Landscape Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/reports) has some data not available on the website.

America is the land of [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) I guess.

**Addendum:** I want to make clear that I’m not assuming a Blank Slate model where the sources of moral intuition or reason that people offer up is actually the *real* source, as opposed to a post facto confabulation. The survey is simply interesting to me as a window into the public’s own self-perception.
