Cognition & Culture

In case you don’t know, the [Cognition & Culture](http://www.cognitionandculture.net/) group blog is of some interest. One of the contributors is Dan Sperber, [who I interviewed a few years ago](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/10-questions-for-dan-sperber.php). Sperber et al. work within the [naturalistic paradigm in cultural anthropology](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/01/nature_culture_the_revival_of.php). I like to think of it as anthropology that comes not to praise gibberish, but bury it. In all likelihood the models are mostly wrong, **but that’s a feature**. In much of American cultural anthropology the models can’t even be wrong because of the incredibly obfuscatory word-play.
