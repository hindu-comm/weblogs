Women getting better looking, the paper….

**Update:** [The author of the paper clears up confusions](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/mmjokela/women-are-getting-more-beautiful-getting-the-story-right/).  
Follow up to the post yesterday, here’s the paper, [Physical attractiveness and reproductive success in humans: evidence from the late 20th century United States](http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(09)00027-0/abstract):

> Physical attractiveness has been associated with mating behavior, but > its role in reproductive success of contemporary humans has received > surprisingly little attention. In the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study > (1244 women, 997 men born between 1937 and 1940), we examined whether > attractiveness assessed from photographs taken at age ∼18 years > predicted the number of biological children at age 53-56 years. In > women, attractiveness predicted higher reproductive success in a > nonlinear fashion, so that attractive (second highest quartile) women > had 16% and very attractive (highest quartile) women 6% more children > than their less attractive counterparts. In men, there was a threshold > effect so that men in the lowest attractiveness quartile had 13% fewer > children than others who did not differ from each other in the average > number of children. These associations were partly but not completely > accounted for by attractive participants’ increased marriage > probability. A linear regression analysis indicated relatively weak > directional selection gradient for attractiveness (β=0.06 in women, > β=0.07 in men). These findings indicate that physical attractiveness > may be associated with reproductive success in humans living in > industrialized settings.

I don’t see a point in commenting further at this point. Since Satoshi Kanazawa is a fan of [Ann Coulter](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/why-we-are-losing-war) (H/T [Jezebel](https://jezebel.com/5324453/ann-coulter%20loving-scientist-says-women-are-getting-hotter)), I think it would be appropriate to refer to him as the “Ann Coulter of Evolutionary Psychology.” His genius for self-promotion is equivalent.
