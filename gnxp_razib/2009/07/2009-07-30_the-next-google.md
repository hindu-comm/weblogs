The next Google?

The [collaboration between Yahoo! and Microsoft](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124890663497891625.html?mod=googlenews_wsj) is spawning a lot of articles about the coming duopoly in search (since the Yahoo! Microsoft deal is for 10 years, we’re talking 10 year horizon times). But this got me to thinking: **when did people realize Google was something big?** I realized Google was something big (for me personally since I’m a data junkie) after being pointed to it from this [article in *Salon* in December of 1998](http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/1998/12/21/straight/index.html). I became a Google evangelist. Initially most people thought my enthusiasm was a bit strange, at that point there were a dozen search engines, and all of them were pretty much crap. Of course once anyone used Google they never touched anything else again (to be fair, it took a little while for Google’s indexing to overtake all other search engines, so there was some utility in checking the others for a bit).  
But when did Google hit the media radar? It seems that *The New York Times* didn’t see fit to mention it until July of 1999, [I Link, Therefore I Am: a Web Intellectual’s Diary](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/technology/i-link-therefore-i-am-a-web-intellectual-s-diary.html?scp=2&sq=google&st=nyt):

Yes, Google is simply an aside, not the the focus of this article. Here’s a [post](http://technologizer.com/2009/05/22/how-long-did-it-take-for-the-world-to-identify-google-as-an-altavista-killer/) which tried to be more thorough, [How Long Did It Take for the World to Identify Google as an AltaVista Killer?](http://technologizer.com/2009/05/22/how-long-did-it-take-for-the-world-to-identify-google-as-an-altavista-killer/)  
Finally, an article I specifically remember from the spring of 2001, [GoTo gains amid Web pains](http://news.cnet.com/GoTo-gains-amid-Web-pains/2100-1023_3-257328.html):

> “For us, the turning point came in March as our strong first-quarter > results rolled in,” said Meisel, whose Pasadena, Calif.-based company > has just completed three consecutive quarters of 30 percent revenue > growth and seven quarters of 20 percent growth.  
> GoTo’s performance in the first quarter, vaulting well past analysts’ > expectations, has raised the company’s profile as Web content > companies in general and search providers in particular examine their > businesses in an attempt to survive the online ad bust and an overall > dot-com shakeout.

GoTo was of course eventually acquired by Yahoo!
