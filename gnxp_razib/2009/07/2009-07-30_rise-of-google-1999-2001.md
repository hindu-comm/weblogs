Rise of Google, 1999-2001

A quick follow up to the post below, I was curious as to the increased profile of Google in [The New York Times](http://nytimes.com/) (Google trends doesn’t seem to be available to the public before 2004) around the turn of the century. In particular, I curious as to Google’s prominence in the “Technology” section of the paper. So I looked it up. There were 78 mentions between July 1999 and December 2001. Mentions of Google increase at a rapid clip throughout this whole period. Below is a histogram of this period, illustrating the consistent rise in frequency of mention.
