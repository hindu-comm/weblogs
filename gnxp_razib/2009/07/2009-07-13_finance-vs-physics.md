Finance vs. physics

Interesting [Q & A on the “shadow banking” system](http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/07/exclusive_interview_what_is_shadow_banking_and_how_did_it_fail.php) over at *The Atlantic*. The last answer is illustrative of a major distinction between physical and social systems:

> I use the term “Credit Insurer of Last Resort.” And here’s the idea: > The Bagehot Rule – lend freely, at a high rate, in a crisis – dates > from 1873. That was a good enough rule for the 19th century British > economy, an economy that ran on short term commercial bills of > exchange, 90-day paper. You can see for the new capital markets > banking system we have a problem. We have 30-year mortgages that are > the underlying asset that are being turned into 90-day paper through > asset-backed commercial paper, or a repurchasing agreement, or repo, > but the underlying asset is still a 30-year mortgage. That is where > the system broke, because those mortgages serve as collateral for the > short term borrowing.  
> Floating the system with money market liquidity, which is what the Fed > did, didn’t solve the problem, because it wasn’t getting to the > capital markets. That’s why we need a credit insurer of last resort, > to put a floor on the value of the best collateral in the system. I > say the new Bagehot Rule should be: Insure freely but at a high > premium.  
> Why a high premium? **If you insure an earthquake, you are not making > earthquakes more likely. The insurance contract is a purely derivative > contract, it isn’t influencing earthquakes. *That is not true of > insurance of financial risk.*** When AIG is selling you systemic risk > insurance for 15 basis points, that price is too low. People said: “If > I can get rid of the whole tail risk that cheaply, I should load up. I > should take more systemic risk.” So the prices were wrong. So the > important thing for government intervention here is to get that price > closer to a reasonable rate to prevent people from creating > earthquakes.

Brings to mind the idea that the best way to encourage safe driving is to place an iron spike into the steering wheel.
