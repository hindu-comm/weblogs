Social stuff happens in the brain

[Randall](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/006373.html) points me to a paper, [Brain Regions for Perceiving and Reasoning About Other People in School-Aged Children](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122513434/abstract):

> Neuroimaging studies with adults have identified cortical regions > recruited when people think about other people’s thoughts (theory of > mind): temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate, and medial > prefrontal cortex. These same regions were recruited in 13 children > aged 6â€“11 years when they listened to sections of a story describing > a character’s thoughts compared to sections of the same story that > described the physical context. A distinct region in the posterior > superior temporal sulcus was implicated in the perception of > biological motion. Change in response selectivity with age was > observed in just one region. The right temporoâ€“parietal junction was > recruited equally for mental and physical facts about people in > younger children, but only for mental facts in older children.

The sample included 7 girls and 6 boys. No mention of sex differences. Though perhaps the methods were too coarse. In any case, aspiring neuroimagers of social intelligence just need to go to a [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org/) meeting to recruit cognitive outliers!
