How tall will Megan McArdle & Peter Suderman's theoretical offspring be?

![shawn-bradley.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/shawn-bradley.png?resize=199%2C155)![shawn-bradley.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/shawn-bradley.png?resize=199%2C155)[Peter Suderman](http://theamericanscene.com/2009/07/04/megan-mcardle-is-one-of-my-favorite-bloggers-i-like-her-so-much-in-fact-that-i-asked-her-to-marry-me) & [Megan McArdle](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/onward_and_upwards.php) are getting married. One of my thoughts was, “How tall will their offspring be?” (assuming they are intent on producing any) I couldn’t tell Peter Suderman’s height from photographs with certainty, but he has confirmed they are the same height, 6 feet 2 inches. What sort of heights would we expect for the McSuderkinder?\* Assuming 80% [heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability) for height, 3 inches as the standard deviation for both sexes, 5’10 and 5’4 as mean heights (male & female), and plugging into the calculator:

  
The highest probability of height for any male offspring: 6 feet 3.6 inches.  
The highest probability of height for any female offspring: 5 feet 9.6 inches.  
68.27% male offspring will be between 6 feet 0.6 inches and 6 feet 6.6 inches  
68.27% female offspring will be between 5 feet 6.6 inches and 6 feet 0.6 inches  
(1 standard deviation)  
95.45% male offspring will be between and 5 feet 9.6 inches and 6 feet 9.6 inches  
95.45% female offspring will be between 5 feet 3.6 inches and 6 feet 3.6 inches  
(2 standard deviations)  
In other words, there is only a 1 out of 40 chance that any given daughter will be taller than the world’s tallest female econoblogger (though I assume by the time that any such daughter realizes such a height blogging will no longer exist). Blame Peter, he’s less than 2 standard deviations above the mean….  
\* Or should I say the half-bloods?
