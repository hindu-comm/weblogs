Tit-for-Tat

While skimming today’s UK newspapers I noticed this [report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5777508/Taking-it-in-turns-is-down-to-evolution.html) in the Daily Telegraph on research into the evolution of ‘tit-for-tat’ reciprocal altruism. I haven’t checked out the original research, but thought I would post the story for general interest.
