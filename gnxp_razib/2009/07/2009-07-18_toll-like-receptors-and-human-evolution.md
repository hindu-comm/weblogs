Toll-like receptors and human evolution

[Evolutionary Dynamics of Human Toll-Like Receptors and Their Different Contributions to Host Defense](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000562). Interesting stuff on inter-population variation in the discussion:

> **Our data show that TLR1, and more specifically the nonsynonymous > T1805G variant (I602S), is the genuine target of positive selection > detected in the TLR10-TLR1-TLR6 gene cluster in Europeans. First, TLR1 > is \~2 times more diverse in non-African than in African populations, > a pattern not compatible with the African origin of modern humans…This > pattern has been observed only once among the 323 genes (0.3%) > sequenced by the Seattle SNP consortium**. Thus, the increased > diversity observed in TLR1 among non-Africans probably results from > ongoing hitchhiking between the selected allele and neutral variation > at linked sites. Second, the 1805G (602S) mutation presents the > highest level of population differentiation (FST = 0.54) of all SNPs > located in this gene cluster…Third, among the three nonsynonymous > variants composing the haplotype identified as being under positive > selection in Europeans (H34, see Figure S5), only the TLR1 1805G > (602S) variant has a remarkable impairment effect on agonist-induced > NF-ÎºB activation, showing a decreased signaling by up to 60%…These > findings are consistent with previous studies showing that, > homozygous, and to a lesser extent heterozygous, individuals for the > 1805G allele present impaired TLR1-mediated immune responses after > whole blood stimulation …Taken together, it is tempting to speculate > that an attenuated TLR1-mediated signaling, and a consequently reduced > inflammatory response, has conferred a selective advantage in > Europeans – a scenario that would explain the very high frequency > (51%) of the “hypo-responsiveness” T1805G mutation in Europe. This > observation raises questions about the possible evolutionary conflict > between developing optimal mechanisms of pathogen recognition by TLRs, > and more generally PRRs, and avoiding an excessive inflammatory > response that can be harmful for the host.

This looks to be the same area fingered [earlier](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/06/evolution-of-icelanders.php) in Icelanders.
