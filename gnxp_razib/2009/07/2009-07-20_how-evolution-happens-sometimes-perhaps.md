How evolution happens (sometimes, perhaps)

[Partial penetrance facilitates developmental evolution in bacteria](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08150.html):

> Development normally occurs similarly in all individuals within an > isogenic population, **but mutations often affect the fates of > individual organisms differently**…This phenomenon, known as partial > penetrance, has been observed in diverse developmental systems. > However, it remains unclear how the underlying genetic network > specifies the set of possible alternative fates and how the relative > frequencies of these fates evolve…Here we identify a stochastic cell > fate determination process that operates in Bacillus subtilis > sporulation mutants and show how it allows genetic control of the > penetrance of multiple fates. Mutations in an intercompartmental > signalling process generate a set of discrete alternative fates not > observed in wild-type cells, including rare formation of two viable > ‘twin’ spores, rather than one within a single cell. By genetically > modulating chromosome replication and septation, we can systematically > tune the penetrance of each mutant fate. Furthermore, signalling and > replication perturbations synergize to significantly increase the > penetrance of twin sporulation. These results suggest a potential > pathway for developmental evolution between monosporulation and twin > sporulation through states of intermediate twin penetrance. > Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy of twin sporulation in wild-type > Clostridium oceanicum shows a strong resemblance to twin sporulation > in these B. subtilis mutants…Together the results suggest that noise > can facilitate developmental evolution by enabling the initial > expression of discrete morphological traits at low penetrance, and > **allowing their stabilization by gradual adjustment of genetic > parameters.**

Also, see press release, [Caltech-led team shows how evolution can allow for large developmental leaps](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-07/ciot-cts072009.php). A bit grandiose in headline.
