In defense of rationality

Michael Vassar emailed me the following in response to my [indicated skepticism of rationality](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/04/cult-of-rationality.php):

I agree with Michael. I think rationality, and more specifically science, is our hope in the great sea of noise. It is after all what we depend on to enable the affluent life which we all take for granted. But on an interpersonal level I’m rather skeptical of great rational systems which very smart people attempt to convince me of, and which I was rather attracted to as a younger man. I’m also skeptical about my ability to judge the plausibility of many the rational systems which I encounter in my conversations as well. My skepticism varies a function of domain. In mathematics and the physical sciences rationality has enormous utility. In much of the life sciences rationality has some utility, but it has far less power than in the physical sciences. And so on down the great chain.

My skepticism manifests in rather concrete ways. I would rather have a drink with someone than listen to their grand theory of history, no matter how smart they are. On the other hand if they are able to illuminate the [Feynman lectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics) with exceeding clarity because of their intelligence and knowledge I am definitely interested in passing on the alcohol to maintain my mental acuity.
