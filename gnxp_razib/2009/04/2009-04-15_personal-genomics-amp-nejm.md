Personal genomics & NEJM

Multiple articles on personal genomics in *The New England Journal of Medicine*, [Genomewide Association Studies and Human Disease](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMra0808700), [Common Genetic Variation and Human Traits](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0806284), [Genomewide Association Studies â€“ Illuminating Biologic Pathways](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0808934) and [Genetic Risk Prediction -Are We There Yet?](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0810107). Nick Wade has a [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/health/research/16gene.html?ref=global-home&pagewanted=print) on these articles in *The New York Times*.
