In search of rare variants

In response to the *NEJM* issue on personal genomics and the CDCV hypothesis, [p-ter offers a proposal](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/04/argument-for-searching-for-rare.php):

> Let’s follow Goldstein’s back-of-the-envelope calculations: assume > there are \~100K polymorphisms (assuming Goldstein isn’t making the > mistake I attribute to him, this includes polymorphisms both common > and rare) that contribute to human height, that we’ve found the ones > that account for the largest fractions of the variance, and that these > fractions of variance follow an exponential distribution.  
> Now, assume you have assembled a cohort of 5000 individuals and done a > genome-wide association study using common SNPs. You find some > interesting things, but you want more. Now, you have two choices: > sequence those 5000 individuals to look for rarer variation, or > increase sample size to 20,000 and perform another association study > using the same set of common polymorphisms.
