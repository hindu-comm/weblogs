Vitamin D & asthma

[Serum Vitamin D Levels and Markers of Severity of Childhood Asthma in Costa Rica](http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/179/9/765). See [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090423082638.htm). Anecdote: my own asthma has gotten *much* better since I started Vitamin D supplementation. Not only have I had many fewer bouts of bronchitis the past few years, but my basal respiratory functioning is much improved.
