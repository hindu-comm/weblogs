Google books developments

[Google’s Plan for Out-of-Print Books Is Challenged](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/technology/internet/04books.html?ref=global-home&pagewanted=print):

> The settlement, which covers all books protected by copyright in the > United States, allows Google to vastly expand what it can do with > digital copies of books, whether they are orphans or not. >
> Google will be allowed to show readers in the United States as much as > 20 percent of most copyrighted books, and will sell access to the > entire collection to universities and other institutions. Public > libraries will get free access to the full texts for their patrons at > one computer, and individuals will be able to buy online access to > particular books.
