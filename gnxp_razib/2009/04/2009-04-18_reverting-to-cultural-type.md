Reverting to cultural type

[Who I Am Depends on How I Feel: The Role of Affect in the Expression of Culture](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122212482/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

> We present a novel role of affect in the expression of culture. Four > experiments tested whether individuals’ affective states moderate the > expression of culturally normative cognitions and behaviors. We > consistently found that value expressions, self-construals, and > behaviors were less consistent with cultural norms when individuals > were experiencing positive rather than negative affect. Positive > affect allowed individuals to explore novel thoughts and behaviors > that departed from cultural constraints, whereas negative affect bound > people to cultural norms. As a result, when Westerners experienced > positive rather than negative affect, they valued self-expression > less, showed a greater preference for objects that reflected > conformity, viewed the self in more interdependent terms, and sat > closer to other people. East Asians showed the reverse pattern for > each of these measures, valuing and expressing individuality and > independence more when experiencing positive than when experiencing > negative affect. The results suggest that affect serves an important > functional purpose of attuning individuals more or less closely to > their cultural heritage.

More in [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090414153538.htm):

> … And elevated mood even shaped behavior, allowing volunteers to act > “out of character.” These findings suggest that people in an upbeat > mood are more exploratory and daring in attitude â€” and therefore > more apt to break from cultural stereotype. That is, Asians act more > independently than usual, and Europeans are more cooperative. Feeling > bad did the opposite: It reinforced traditional cultural stereotypes > and constrained both Western and Eastern thinking about the world.

I think these data are interesting in light of the sort of argument presented in works such as [The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400095719/geneexpressio-20/). The standard model here is that cultural openness correlates with economic growth, while stagnation results in retrenchment.
