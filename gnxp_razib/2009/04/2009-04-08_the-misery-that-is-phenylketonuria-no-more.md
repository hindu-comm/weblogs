The misery that is Phenylketonuria, no more?

I only know about [Phenylketonuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria) (PKU) because it is an elementary example of an autosomal recessive disease. Newborns are [routinely tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria#Screening_and_presentation), because those with PKU may develop mental retardation on a normal diet. That’s about all I knew, but this from Wikipedia:

> If PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with > normal brain development, but only by eating a special diet low in > phenylalanine for the rest of his or her life. **This requires > severely restricting or eliminating foods high in phenylalanine, such > as meat, chicken, fish, nuts, cheese, legumes and other dairy > products. Starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, pasta, and corn must > be monitored.** Infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the > benefits of breastmilk, though the quantity must be monitored and > supplementation will be required. Many diet foods and diet soft drinks > that contain the sweetener aspartame must also be avoided, as > aspartame consists of two amino acids: phenylalanine and aspartic acid

This diet has to be followed throughout life, and supplemented with a bitter cocktail of amino acids in the form of a liquid. But perhaps not for much longer, [New Options For People With PKU](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090330154804.htm):

> For people with the genetic condition known as phenylketonuria (PKU), > diet is a constant struggle. They can eat virtually no protein, and > instead get their daily dose of this key macronutrient by drinking a > bitter-tasting formula of amino acids. Yet drink it they must; > deviating from this strict dietary regimen puts them at risk of > developing permanent neurological damage.  
> …  
> In April, a team of University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers will > publish the second of two key papers showing that a unique protein > derived from whey — known as glycomacropeptide, or GMP — is safe for > people with PKU to eat. GMP is the first known natural protein that is > safe for this group, and these findings are poised to revolutionize > the PKU diet. Already, Cambrooke Foods, a Massachusetts company that > specializes in the manufacture of medical foods, is in the process of > developing GMP-fortified snack foods for commercial sale.  
> …  
> The first GMP human feeding trial was published in February in the > Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disorders. In it, Ney and her team > describe the experience of an individual with PKU who volunteered to > consume an all-GMP diet for 10 weeks. As the paper explains, not only > did the subject enjoy the GMP-fortified snack bar, pudding and sports > beverage that supplied most of his daily protein, but the amount of > phenylalanine in his blood actually starting going down after he ate > these items for a couple of weeks.  
> “And because the subject enjoyed the GMP foods, he was more inclined > to eat them throughout the day, which helps keep the body’s protein > metabolism running efficiently all day long,” says Ney. “When he went > back to the amino acid formula, he went back to drinking it all in one > sitting.”

Thank God for modern medicine!
