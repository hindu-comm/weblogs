Copy number & common variants

*Science News* has an interesting piece up, [Shared Differences: The architecture of our genomes is anything but basic](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/42620/title/Shared_Differences). The main focus is on genetic variation, the possibility that there might be important information in [copy number variance](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=cnv+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search), and that the [common disease-common variant hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_disease-common_variant) is dead. At least for complex traits that weâ€™re interested in like schizophrenia. If any of this is unfamiliar or confusing, I recommend the article, it even has references to the primary literature that you can follow up on.
