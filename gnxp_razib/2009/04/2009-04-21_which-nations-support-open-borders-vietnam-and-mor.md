Which nations support open borders…Vietnam…and more

The [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) has a question about immigration policy with four options:  
– Let anyone come  
– As long as jobs available  
– Strict limits  
– Prohibit people from coming  
I used WVS 2005-2008 from 57 countries first. Then I filled out the countries with the  
Four-wave Aggregate of the Values Studies, the combined file of the four waves carried out by both the EVS and WVS. I bring this up because there are discrepancies between the two where there are duplications.  
Again Vietnam is at the top of the list. Perhaps [Will Wilkson](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2009/04/09/waking-up-canadian/) should have picked another country to trade in his American citizenship with? In any case, results below.

[TABLE]

The table is rather self-explanatory. The first four columns show the proportion sorted for the two most extreme positions, open borders vs. closed borders. In the fifth & sixth columns you see the result of my converting the categorical responses into ordinal values, so that 0 = open borders and 3 = closed borders, with the two moderate positions 1 & 2. So the higher values mean that the population more sympathetic to that closed than open borders. A uniform distribution would = 1.5. Finally, you also have the ratio between open and closed borders where the moderate positions are added to the extremes.
