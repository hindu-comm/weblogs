The secret history of Africa

In light of the relatively recent interaction of Bantu farmers and Pygmies in Central Africa, this paper is of note, [Genetic and demographic implications of the Bantu expansion: insights from human paternal lineages](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/msp069v1?rss=1):

I’ve heard about the [R1b1\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1b_(Y-DNA)#R1b1) in Africa before, but hadn’t thought much about it. In short it looks like the most plausible models is one of back migration from Western Eurasia within the last 10,000, to the point where derived haplotypes are extant at relatively high frequencies in some regions of West-Central Africa. In light of the likelihood that the phylogeography of Africa has been assembled into its recognizable present form very recently these data are of more interest. [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/04/paternal-traces-of-bantu-expansion.html) notes from the paper:

The standard deviation is big, so I wouldn’t too much faith the estimates aside from the likelihood that the expansion didn’t occur during the height of the Ice Age. One might remember that Eurasian variants of *LCT* which confer lactase persistence are found in West Africa, among the peoples of he Sahel. Though this is likely a more recent instance of gene flow (with more certitude as to its time interval than the R1b1\* back migration), it shows that despite the Sahara there are ways that genes can seep back into Africa from the outside. One of [Dienekes readers has posted a list of links](https://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/04/y-haplotypes-in-africa.html) on the topic for those who want to dig deeper….
