Prediction markets

[It’s News On Academia, Not Climate](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/11/its-news-on-academia-not-climate.html):

> Yup, this behavior has long been typical when academics form competing > groups, whether the public hears about such groups or not. If you knew > how academia worked, this news would not surprise you nor change your > opinions on global warming. I’ve never done this stuff, and I’d like > to think I wouldn’t, but that is cheap talk since I haven’t had the > opportunity. This works as a “scandal” only because of academia’s > overly idealistic public image. >
> It is a shame that academia works this way, and an academia where this > stuff didn’t happen would probably be more accurate. But even our > flawed academic consensus is usually more accurate than its > contrarians, and it is hard to find reliable cheap indicators saying > when contrarians are more likely to be right. >
> If you don’t like this state of affairs join me in trying to develop a > more reliable consensus mechanism on such topics: prediction markets. > It just takes time or money. Prefer instead to act shocked, just > shocked, when the other side is shown to do this stuff, while > reserving your sideâ€™s ability to do the same? Then I have little > respect for you.
