Why whales get no bigger

Carl Zimmer reports that it [might be a function of physics](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/11/24/the-origin-of-big/). Bigger whales have proportionality bigger mouths, but at some point the biological engineering runs up against constraints:

> s they report today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Goldbogen > and his colleagues found that big fin whales are not just scaled-up > versions of little fin whales. Instead, as their bodies get bigger, > their mouths get much bigger. Small fin whales can swallow up about > 90% of their own body weight. Very big ones can gulp 160%.

Given enough time and a large population one can imagine that evolution might be able to figure out a solution, or back out of the adaptive dead end.
