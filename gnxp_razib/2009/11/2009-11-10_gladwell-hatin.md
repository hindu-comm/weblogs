Gladwell hatin'

Some red meat for readers, [Malcolm Gladwell, Memes and Intellectual Honesty](https://religionsetspolitics.blogspot.com/2009/11/malcolm-gladwell-memes-and-intellectual.html):

> Gladwell comes across as a child trying to explain why his hand was in > the cookie jar. He advances a series of unconvincing, somewhat > contradictory explanations, hoping that we will ignore the larger > problem. So far as I can tell from Google searching, this strategy has > worked; people have noted that Gladwell is talking about memes but no > one has called him out for his failure to acknowledge this prior work. > This isn’t acceptable. Gladwell’s behavior is intellectually > dishonest. His failure to credit Dawkins or others who have thought > about these ideas before him does a disservice to those individuals > and to honest intellectual discourse. I don’t think Gladwell’s > behavior constitutes plagiarism, but it certainly would be punished if > it occurred in an academic setting. Failure to cite prior work results > in a paper being rejected from any legitimate journal. If a student > hands in an assignment that fails to cite prior work, the student > receives a bad grade, if not outright failure. Gladwell owes his > readers and Richard Dawkins an apology for his failure to acknowledge > that Gladwell’s idea recycles Dawkins’s earlier work.
