The wealth of politicians

[Open Secrets](http://www.opensecrets.org/) has data on members of the House and Senate in relation to their net worth. Here are some descriptive statistics:  
**Democrats & Republicans:**  
25th percentile = \$228,006  
Median = \$791,004  
75thth percentile = \$2,962,519  
Mean = \$6,438,210  
**Republicans:**  
25th percentile = \$269,007  
Median = \$999,381  
75thth percentile = \$3,421,512  
Mean = \$6,010,456  
**Democrats:**  
25th percentile = \$217,001  
Median = \$718,756  
75thth percentile = \$2,516,033  
Mean = \$6,731952  
Let’s limit to those who have positive net worth (greater than zero) and less than \$50,000,000. This is about two standard deviations above the median, so it removes the top \~2% who tend to skew the results.

  
**Democrats & Republicans:**  
25th percentile = \$299,756  
Median = \$803,507  
75thth percentile = \$2,829,274  
Mean = \$3,134,246  
**Republicans:**  
25th percentile = \$301,129  
Median = \$984,694  
75thth percentile = \$3,284,281  
Mean = \$3,540,125  
**Democrats:**  
25th percentile = \$299,756  
Median = \$777,009  
75thth percentile = \$2,496,290  
Mean = \$2,835,933
