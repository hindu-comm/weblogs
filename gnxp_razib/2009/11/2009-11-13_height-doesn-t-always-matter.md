Height doesn't always matter….

[How universal are human mate choices? Size doesn’t matter when Hadza foragers are choosing a mate](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24375/):

> It has been argued that size matters on the human mate market: both > stated preferences and mate choices have been found to be non-random > with respect to height and weight. But how universal are these > patterns? Most of the literature on human mating patterns is based on > post-industrial societies.

Here’s some stuff from the discussion:

This lack of > size-related mating patterns might appear surprising, since size is > usually assumed to be an indicator of health, productivity and overall > quality.

Here’s a chart which shows the proportion of females-taller-than-male marriages by culture:

In a [previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/11/quantitative-ecologist-looks-at-world.php) I suggested that the shift from small-scale societies to agricultural societies witnessed a transition from an emphasis on innate individual level social intelligence toward rules and heuristics (in other words, wisdom embodied in the preferences of society and its institutions). **External physical characteristics are *correlated* with “health,” so they’re useful.** And those who are not physically attractive can signal their own status and abilities in other ways, ugly fat men can for example buy material signalers to show that they have something going on. It strikes me that the [Wisdom of Seinfeld](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002438.html) is most appropriate for large urban areas with some degree of anonymity. Quick & dirty signalers to filter and influence one’s choices are critical in the incredibly large number of human interactions possible in these urban agglomerations. By contrast, if [George Costanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Costanza) lived in a village one would know enough about his persona to dismiss a random “pairing” with an attractive woman as an aberration (or, one would know the back-story to this bizarre pairing).

As our modern post-industrial society shifts toward information transparency perhaps we’ll become less “shallow”? Remember the 1995 film [Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_(film)), the attractive alien character met a handsome male at a night club. She assessed his fitness through his looks to make the initial choice. But later she killed him when she found that he was a diabetic. If she’d been able to access his health profile on her iPhone perhaps he would have been able to live for another day?
