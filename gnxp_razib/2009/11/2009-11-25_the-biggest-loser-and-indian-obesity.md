The Biggest Loser and Indian obesity

After reading this [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/business/media/25loser.html?hp) about the [The Biggest Loser](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/business/media/25loser.html?hp), I checked out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Biggest_Loser) for the show. There are international versions. Through that I found out that there is an [Indian version of the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biggest_Loser_Jeetega). I thought this was weird. I mean, it’s *India, right*? Well, [around 2% of Indian women are obese](http://www.nfhsindia.org/data/india/indch7.pdf) (BMI 30 and above). That’s 20 million obese! In India obesity still seems to correlate with wealth and higher status. Nearly 10% of women in Delhi and Punjab are obese (vs. 0.5% in Bihar, the heart of the “Deep North”). Nearly 10% of Jains are obese. 6.5% of women who have completed secondary school are obese, vs. 1% of illiterates. 6% of people in urban areas vs. 1% in rural areas.
