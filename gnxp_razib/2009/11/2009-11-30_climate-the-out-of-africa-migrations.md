Climate & the Out of Africa migration(s)

[Wet phases in the Sahara/Sahel region and human migration patterns in North Africa](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/11/0905771106.abstract):

> The carbon isotopic composition of individual plant leaf waxes (a > proxy for C3 vs. C4 vegetation) in a marine sediment core collected > from beneath the plume of Sahara-derived dust in northwest Africa > reveals three periods during the past 192,000 years when the central > Sahara/Sahel contained C3 plants (likely trees), indicating > substantially wetter conditions than at present. Our data suggest that > variability in the strength of Atlantic meridional overturning > circulation (AMOC) is a main control on vegetation distribution in > central North Africa, and we note expansions of C3 vegetation during > the African Humid Period (early Holocene) and within Marine Isotope > Stage (MIS) 3 (≈50-45 ka) and MIS 5 (≈120-110 ka). The wet periods > within MIS 3 and 5 coincide with major human migration events out of > sub-Saharan Africa. **Our results thus suggest that changes in AMOC > influenced North African climate and, at times, contributed to > amenable conditions in the central Sahara/Sahel, allowing humans to > cross this otherwise inhospitable region.**

More details from the discussion:

> The influence of AMOC on vegetation type in North Africa is of > particular interest because this region may have played a key role in > the dispersal of anatomically modern humans, which originated in > sub-Saharan Africa at 195 ka…into Europe and Southwest Asia…A major > dispersal period occurred between 130 and 100 ka…which coincides with > a major expansion of C3 vegetation from 120-110 ka (Fig. 2), and thus > wetter conditions in the Sahara region, supporting the hypothesis that > the Sahara could have provided a dispersal route out of Africa…  
> The most depleted n-alkane 13Cvalues of the entire record are noted > within MIS 3, from 50-45 ka (Fig. 2), suggesting a major expansion of > C3 plants. Interestingly, this interval coincides with a second major > dispersal period of hominins out of Africa, dated to 60-40 ka, mainly > based on studies of mtDNA…Additionally, mtDNA evidence suggests that a > back migration into Africa from southwestern Asia occurred at 45-40 > ka, and it is thought that this event resulted from a climatic change > that allowed humans to enter the Levant…Thus, as with the first out of > Africa migration during MIS 5, our data suggest that a second period > of hominin migration at 60-40 ka may have been facilitated by amenable > climate conditions in the central Sahara….

Here’s a chart which shows the correlation with the “Out of Africa” event:
