When mammoths roamed

[Pleistocene Megafaunal Collapse, Novel Plant Communities, and Enhanced Fire Regimes in North America](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/326/5956/1100):

> Although the North American megafaunal extinctions and the formation > of novel plant communities are well-known features of the last > deglaciation, the causal relationships between these phenomena are > unclear.

A complex story like this is perhaps more common than an event such as the extinction of the passenger pigeons. Populations of organisms often go through cycles in census size, whether due to environmental variation or coevolutionary dynamics with parasites. Consider the example of the [Tasmania devil](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=tasmanian+devil+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search), the disease which it is susceptible to is not the doing of humans, but the introduction of dingos (probably by humans) mean that the species is restricted to Tasmania. Additionally, humans have laid claim to much of the habitat of the devil (or what was the habitat of the devil). When a virulent disease hits, the devil has a much smaller margin of error than it had before. It could be that recent megafaunal extinctions are **ultimately due to humans, even if they are not always proximately due to humans.**
