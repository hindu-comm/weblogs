Rich people are Republican, not conservative

So says the [data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/08/rich_people_are.html) according to Andrew Gelman. I think there is some serious issues with self-reports of whether someone is a conservative or liberal which donâ€™t occur with political parties. People know whether they are Republican or Democrat in a more concrete manner because **they have often realized their preferences through voting.**
