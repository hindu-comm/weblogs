Hispanics more religious, not that zealous

A few months ago I pointed out that minorities don’t oppose gay marriage, blacks do. Specifically, there are sometimes assumptions that Hispanics are extremely religious Roman Catholics characterized by very socially conservative views. From what I have seen the data are of much more modest magnitude than what characterizations would suggest, but I thought it would be useful to put some numbers from the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08) up. The years are from 2000-2008, when the “Hispanic” variable was being collected. First I separated into three categories, Non-Hispanics who were not black, which was a 95% white and 5% Asian sample. Then Hispanics (who were 1/3 white and 2/3 “Other”) and finally, blacks. Second, I decided to look at Non-Hispanic vs. Hispanic Roman Catholics. In this sample of Hispanics 2/3 were Roman Catholics.

Hispanics are somewhat more religious than the median American, but the data are spotty in arguing for a strong distinction. The main issue where a noticeable difference crops up is on the question of abortion, which is probably a cultural issue since many Hispanics and/or their families are of recent origin from [nations where abortion is illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law#Southern_and_non-English-speaking_middle_areas).
