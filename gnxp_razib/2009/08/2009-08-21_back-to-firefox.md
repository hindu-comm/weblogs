Back to Firefox

Switched back to Firefox from Chrome. I’ve been using it for the past 2 days and there isn’t a discernible difference in speed. I got tired of some of Chrome’s minor bugs which emerge in AJAX driven websites which haven’t been test-driven on that particular browser, so I thought I would see if version 3.5.2 had closed the speed-gap. Seems like it has. At least with only a few extensions.
