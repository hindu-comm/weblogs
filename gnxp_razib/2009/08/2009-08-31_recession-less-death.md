Recession = less death?

[The effect of economic recession on population health](http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/181/5/281):

> **Economic recessions have paradoxical effects on the mortality trends > of populations in rich countries. Contrary to what might have been > expected, economic downturns during the 20th century were associated > with declines in mortality rates.** In terms of business cycles, > mortality is procyclical, meaning it goes up with economic expansions > and down with contractions, and not countercyclical (the opposite), as > expected. So while most nations enjoyed sustained declines in > mortality during the last century, the pace of the decline has been > slower during economic booms and greater during so-called busts. The > first rigorous studies demonstrating this trend have appeared only in > the past 9 years, although the concept is not new. In contrast, for > poor countries, shared economic growth appears to improve health by > providing the means to meet essential needs such as food, clean water > and shelter, as well access to basic health care services. But after a > country reaches \$5000 to \$10 000 gross national product (GNP) per > capita (or gross domestic product or gross national income per capita, > all of which are similar for our purposes here), few health benefits > arise from further economic growthâ€¦Health trends in Sweden illustrate > this effect.

Greg Cochran told me about this phenomenon in regards to the Great Depression last year.
