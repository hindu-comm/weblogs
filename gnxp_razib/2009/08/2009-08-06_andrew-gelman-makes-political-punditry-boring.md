Andrew Gelman makes political punditry boring

[Stories and Stats: The truth about Obama’s victory wasn’t in the papers](http://bostonreview.net/BR34.5/gelman_sides.php):

Most political punditry is actually more like historical fiction; it’s a narrative yarn spun for the entertainment of a public which doesn’t know much about history, but likes their fiction to be grounded in “reality.” I find quantitative political science fascinating and much more illuminating, but alas there just isn’t enough of it to feed the insatiable appetite of “news junkies.” As I’ve said to for years, political & sports punditry really do bear a family resemblance to reading entrails.
