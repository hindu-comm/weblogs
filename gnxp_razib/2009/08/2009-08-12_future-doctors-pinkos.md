Future doctors pinkos?

I was a bit surprised by these data, [Political Self-characterization of U.S. Medical Students](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1829428):

> Among these medical students, 5% self-characterized as politically > very conservative, 21% conservative, 33% moderate, 31% liberal, and 9% > as very liberal.” Being male, white, Protestant, intending to > specialize in Surgery or anesthesiology/pathology/radiology, or > currently or previously being married significantly… increased the > likelihood that a student self-identified as very conservative or > conservative. Disagreement or strong disagreement with the statements, > “I’m glad I chose to become a physician” and “Access to care is a > fundamental human right,” were also both associated with being very > conservative or conservative. Being more liberal was reported by > blacks and Hispanics; those intending to become ob-gyns, > psychiatrists, and pediatric subspecialists; and atheists, Jews, and > adherents of eastern religions.

Below are demographic breakdowns.
