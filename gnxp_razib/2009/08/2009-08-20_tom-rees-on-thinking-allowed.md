Tom Rees on Thinking Allowed

It was a pleasure to hear [Tom Rees](https://bhascience.blogspot.com/2009/08/well-that-went-well.html), one of my favorite religion & data bloggers, on [Thinking Allowed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00m1nlh#synopsis), one of my regular podcasts. [Epiphenom](https://bhascience.blogspot.com/) is of particular interest because Tom Rees offers up original data and analysis, instead of anecdote laced speculation. As they say, if you enjoy *Thinking Allowed*, you might also be interested in [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/)….
