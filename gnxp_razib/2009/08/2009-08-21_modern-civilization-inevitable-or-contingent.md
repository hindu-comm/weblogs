Modern civilization, inevitable, or contingent?

[How inevitable was modern human civilization – data](http://lesswrong.com/lw/165/how_inevitable_was_modern_human_civilization_data/):

> To me it looks like life, animals with nervous systems, Upper > Paleolithic-style Homo, language, and behavioral modernity were all > extremely unlikely events (notice how far ago they are – vaguely > \~3.5bln, \~600mln, \~3mln, \~200k or \~600k, \~50k years ago) – > except perhaps language and behavioral modernity might have been > linked with each other, if language was relatively late (Homo sapiens > only) and behavioral modernity more gradual (and its apparent > suddenness is an artifact). **Once we have behavioral modernity, > modern civilization seems almost inevitable.** Your interpretation > might vary of course, but at least now you have a lot of data to argue > for your position, in convenient format.

I agree with bolded part; see [After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674019997/geneexpressio-20) and [The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465002218/geneexpressio-20/). After the last Ice Age post-hunter-gatherer lifestyles sprouted up independently several times. *Homo* were around during previous [Interglacials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial#Interglacials_during_the_Pleistocene), but there is no evidence of that before. During the Ice Age between the [Eemian Interglacial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian_Stage) \~100,000 years ago and [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene) \~10,000 years ago humanity changed in some fundamental way, so that once the ice retreated the scene was set for an unparalleled cultural explosion.
