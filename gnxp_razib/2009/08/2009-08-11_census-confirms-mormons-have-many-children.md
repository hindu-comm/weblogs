Census confirms Mormons have many children

I’ve been poking around the Census [data sets](http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DatasetMainPageServlet?_lang=en&_ts=268022185213&_ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_&_program=) for a few days now. I want to merge them with the longevity stuff soon, but while was at it I decided to check to see how variation in geography related to variation in fertility. You can go to the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08) and see all sorts of national trends, but I thought a county-by-county view would be of interest. Click the images for bigger versions. The fertility is defined as “women with births in the past 12 months; rate per 1,000 women.” Coming out of the American Community Survey. All the data are for Non-Hispanic white women.
