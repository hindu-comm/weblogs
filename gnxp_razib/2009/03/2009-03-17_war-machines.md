War Machines

This bloggingheads.tv about war robots is pretty fascinating. One of the issues with robots is that people are fixated on androids and really human-like artifice, and that hasn’t really panned out. But it seems that technology is becoming a seamless part of our lives in a way that we’re not even particularly aware of. The new [shuffle](http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/phones-for-new-shuffle-on-the-way/) isn’t just a technology story, it’s a lifestyle & fashion story. I’m very interested near the end when Peter Singer recounts how someone with a chip implant began to consider un-augmented humans “cows.” I’m moderately skeptical of extrapolating from this. It seems to not gel with our innate biases in terms of categorizations in cognitive psychology, and I’m not aware that people who’ve had extensive cosmetic surgery feel superior in any qualitative way. Anyone who is into cosmetic want to weigh in?
