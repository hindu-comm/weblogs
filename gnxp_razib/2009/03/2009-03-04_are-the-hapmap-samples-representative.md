Are the HapMap samples representative?

[Geographical Affinities of the HapMap Samples](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004684):

> The CHB and JPT are readily distinguished from one another with both > autosomal and Y-chromosomal markers, and results obtained after > combining them into a single sample should be interpreted with > caution. The CEU are better described as being of Western European > ancestry than of Northern European ancestry as often reported. Both > the CHB and CEU show subtle but detectable signs of admixture. Thus > the YRI and JPT samples are well-suited to standard population-genetic > studies, but the CHB and CEU less so.
