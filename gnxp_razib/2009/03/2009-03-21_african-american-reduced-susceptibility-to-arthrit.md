African American reduced susceptibility to arthritis?

A few years ago a brown friend of mine complained that there were all these diseases which non-white people were susceptible to at a higher rate (e.g., Type II Diabetes, hypertension, ateriosclerosis, etc.), perhaps the white race was really superior (or medical geneticists were entering into a conspiracy to prove that this was so). So with that, I point to a new *PLoS Genetics* paper, [An African Ancestry-Specific Allele of CTLA4 Confers Protection against Rheumatoid Arthritis in African Americans](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000424):

> Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune condition affecting > the synovial membranes of diarthrodial joints. The etiology of RA is > unclear but is thought to result from an environmental trigger in the > context of genetic predisposition. We report that a single nucleotide > polymorphism (SNP) (rs231778) in CTLA4, which encodes a negative > regulator of T cell activation, is associated (p = 2.4×10−28) with > protection from developing RA among African Americans. rs231778 is > only polymorphic in populations of African ancestry. Protective > alleles such as this one may contribute to the purported lower > prevalence of RA in African Americans. Our finding appears to be > independent from confounding by linkage with the HLA-DRB1 shared > epitope or by genetic admixture. Furthermore, we did not replicate > associations of CTLA4 SNPs with RA or other autoimmune diseases > previously reported in Asians and Caucasians, such as rs3087243 > (+60C/T) and rs231775 (+49A/G). The associations of different SNPs > with RA susceptibility specific to different populations highlight the > importance of CTLA4 in the pathogenesis of RA and demonstrate the > ethnic-specific genetic background that contributes to its > susceptibility.

1\) “Genetic background” matters.  
2) Don’t stop at genetic background; the profiles of the population to which you belong are not necessarily your own profiles. Your genetic profile matters.
