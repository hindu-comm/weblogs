The Intersection has moved

Just a heads up, they’re had [Discover Blogs](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/) now. Just want to note, I welcomed *Tapped* (which Chris Mooney was instrumental in setting up) to the blogosphere in April of 2002. Chris’ acknowledgment of welcome, and my own pre-blogspot weblog, have been vaporized by the digital dustbin, but I wanted to put it into the oral record of blog history.
