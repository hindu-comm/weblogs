The transparent biological society

[FuturePundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/006013.html) has some musings on the possiblities of \$100 genome sequencing in 5 years:

> Cheap portable DNA sequencers will also lead to surreptitious DNA > sequencing of people without their awareness. I expect to see this on > the dating and bar scene. I also expect to see it in job interview and > business negotiation situations. Check to see if your potential > employee or business partner has genes that give them cognitive traits > to avoid or embrace.

To be frank, this seems to b aiming too low. After all, why look to genetic profiles which suggest potentialities or probabilities? If you can get a biological sample could you not simply directly assay for a specific biochemical state? What Iâ€™m saying is that if you are looking for a particular cognitive profile, a better bet than genes might be to simply calculate the chemical state at a given moment.
