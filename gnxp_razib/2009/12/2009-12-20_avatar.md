Avatar

I saw *Avatar* in 3D.  
– The special effects were very good. I have seen special effects of similar quality, but never such quality in such quantity. The detail was striking enough that I assume I stopped thinking of it as “special effects” and more as simply a background canvas. I’m talking more about the landscape, the flora and fauna, than the humanoids, who occasionally slipped into [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) territory.  
– The plot was melodramatic and not particularly exceptional. The ideological ax didn’t bother me because the plot was mostly extraneous to the film’s experience anyhow.  
– I think that the 3D was really not much of a value-add. It was often distracting, especially at the beginning.  
I don’t know how well this film will do. But I think it’s right to assume that this sets a new standard in terms of special effects. In many films special effects are most evident and utilized in action sequences or in alien contexts, when there’s a lot of sensory overload and you can’t fixate too much on whether they look fake or not. In *Avatar* an entire ecology was constructed, and there were many moments of idyllic calm when one could focus on the detail.  
**Note:** The were many sequences which gave me flashbacks to 2005’s [The New World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402399/).
