Tuberculosis resistance

[Two loci control tuberculin skin test reactivity in an area hyperendemic for tuberculosis](http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/206/12/2583?ijkey=0ad3280dfc83e8211d94f12ec03a1987bb825117&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha):

> Approximately 20% of persons living in areas hyperendemic for > tuberculosis (TB) display persistent lack of tuberculin skin test > (TST) reactivity and appear to be naturally resistant to infection by > Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among those with a positive response, the > intensity of TST reactivity varies greatly. The genetic basis of TST > reactivity is not known. We report on a genome-wide linkage search for > loci that have an impact on TST reactivity, which is defined either as > zero versus nonzero (TST-BINa) or as extent of TST in millimeters > (TST-quantitative trait locus \[QTL\]) in a panel of 128 families, > including 350 siblings, from an area of South Africa hyperendemic for > TB. We detected a major locus (TST1) on chromosomal region 11p14 (P = > 1.4 x 10-5), which controls TST-BINa, with a lack of responsiveness > indicating T cell-independent resistance to M. tuberculosis. We also > detected a second major locus (TST2) on chromosomal region 5p15 (P \< > 10-5), which controls TST-QTL or the intensity of T cell-mediated > delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to tuberculin. **Fine mapping of > this region identified SLC6A3, encoding the dopamine transporter DAT1, > as a promising gene for further studies.** Our results pave the way > for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in > resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in endemic areas (TST1) and > for the identification of critical regulators of T cell-dependent DTH > to tuberculin (TST2).

They focus on [rs250682](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=250682) in particular. It seems to me that personal genomics in the interests of health has been a little over-hyped, but I will be happy when people with allergies can get their genes sequenced rather than taking these irritating skin tests.
