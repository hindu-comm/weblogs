Who argues the most from authority?

Google results for +”nobel laureate” +X, where X is one of the following:

Chemistry: 317,000  
Physics: 415,000  
Medicine: 467,000  
Economics: 484,000

Of course, there are more winners to refer to in Physics than in Economics, so we should control for that. Dividing the number of Google results by the number of winners gives these per capita rates:

Chemistry: 2032  
Physics: 2231  
Medicine: 2395  
Economics: 7446

If the intellectual merit of a body of ideas is not so well established, you’re more likely to deflect attention by reassuring everyone that, hey, it can’t be that crazy — after all, the guy is a Nobel laureate. Perhaps that’s why physics ranks above chemistry here, what with string theory etc. taking it further into speculation compared to more grounded chemistry.
