Comments

Haloscan is forcing an upgrade something called Echo. I am not inclined to switch comment systems since this has worked since 2004. So commenting may not work for a bit. But blogging will be light from me for a bit anyway.

**Update:** The new comment system is working, after a fashion. But I can’t install it fully because if I do it will interrupt their migration of Haloscan era comments into the new system, so I will leave it be until they give me the go ahead via email. Despite the fact that the comments box states “0” comments, that is not necessarily so. The new comment system is rather flexible, and I’ve turned on the feature which allows for trusted commenters to go through the mod queue. That means that after an X number of comments over an Y period of time of approved comments you’re listed as trusted. This will probably be good since the active comment community here is relatively small. I’ll start doing other things when I think it won’t break everything.

P.S. There’s a 5,000 character limit on comments. If you regularly go over this, you need a blog.
