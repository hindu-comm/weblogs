Shellfish & the human bottleneck

[How shellfish saved the human race](https://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/16/how-shellfish-saved.html):

This is probably wrong. Though one of the many ideas about this period in human history have to be right. And there’s always the tricky problem of falsification and testing alternative hypotheses when it comes to models of human evolution. From what I know humans are a relatively homogeneous species which underwent some sort of demographic expansion within the last 100,000 years. The tacit assumption seems to be that the proto-modern African lineage nearly went extinct, and then bounced back, possibly due to an exogenous shock. My own question: **why couldn’t it just be that a few bands simply exterminated or marginalized all the other African lineages?** This is an assumption by many about modern humans as they expanded into Eurasia, more or less, so why not in Africa? Humans can certainly reproduce up to the Malthusian limit. In 1800 1.2 million humans were resident in New England, the vast majority of whom were descended from the 20,000-30,000 who arrived in the 1630s. And remember that the reproductive population is going to be a fraction of the census size.

I could speculate on what gave a small subset of African humans an advantage, but I’ll leave that to the comments.
