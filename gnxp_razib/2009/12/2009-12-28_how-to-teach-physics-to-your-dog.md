How to Teach Physics to Your Dog

[Chard Orzelâ€™s](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/12/how_to_teach_physics_to_your_d_6.php) book, [How to Teach Physics to Your Dog](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416572287/geneexpressio-20/), is out. Much props to Chad for being able to write a book while being a professor and father. A man for all seasons indeed!
