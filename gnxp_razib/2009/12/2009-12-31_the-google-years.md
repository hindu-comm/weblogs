The Google Years

[The Google Decade Ends: If the search king hasn’t ripped up your business yet, just wait](http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/0s-1s-and-s/2009/12/31/google-decade-ends?page=full). 10 years is a long time in the tech industry. I wonder which company will be the center of retrospectives in 2010? It seems that the time cycle of the rise & fall of “It” firm is speeding up; from IBM to Microsoft to Google. So perhaps it isn’t even around right now.
