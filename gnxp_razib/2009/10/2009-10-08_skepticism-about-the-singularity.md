Skepticism about the Singularity

From [Matt Springer](http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/10/singularity_summit.php) of [Built on Facts](http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/10/singularity_summit.php). For what it’s worth, many people at the Summit were skeptical of Kurzweil’s specific vision. I mean in the audience, not just among the speakers.
