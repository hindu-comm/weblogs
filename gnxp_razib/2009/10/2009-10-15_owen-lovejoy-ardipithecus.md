Owen Lovejoy & Ardipithecus

Owen Lovejoy has some theories which he is using to process the data from the spate of *Ardipithecus ramidus* papers. When it comes to the argument about social structure based on the anatomy of the extant remains I’m skeptical. I just recorded a diavlog with [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) which is 2/3 devoted to Ardi-issues (should be up Saturday), and he pointed out that Lovejoy has been laying out the case for a monogamous social structure for early hominins for years. This is why I’m not that surprised that [some of the numbers he cites from the literature are off](http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/10/science_got_ardi_wrong.php). He’s probably quoting older values, and hasn’t been tracking updates or revisions.
