Germs, collectivism and serotonin

[Culture-gene coevolution of individualism-collectivism and the serotonin transporter gene](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/10/27/rspb.2009.1650.full):

Here’s what I see going on:

High pre-modern pathogen load → collectivist values → S allele & dampening of psychological responses associated with S allele in populations where it is extant at lower frequencies.

It’s Open Access so you can look at their regressions yourself. The association with **pre-modern** levels of pathogens is a strong point for me, these sorts of biological factors would result in a consistent “push” over long periods of times which culture itself might not have. The agricultural civilizations of Asia were always going to be rich ecologies for infectious diseases. So it would be interesting to look at the frequencies of the S & L alleles on a finer scale; for example, in the islands of Japan. Though that case I suspect that lower-density areas would have had so much migration that selection wouldn’t have time to maintain different allele frequencies.
