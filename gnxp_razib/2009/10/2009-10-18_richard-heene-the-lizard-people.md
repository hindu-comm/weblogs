Richard Heene & the lizard people

Fascinating [interview with Richard Heene’s former assistant](http://gawker.com/5383858/exclusive-i-helped-richard-heene-plan-a-balloon-hoax):

> But he was motivated by theories I thought were far-fetched. Like > Reptilians — the idea there are alien beings that walk among us and > are shape shifters, able to resemble human beings and running the > upper echelon of our government. Somehow a secret government has > covered all this up since the U.S. was established, and the only way > to get the truth out there was to use the mainstream media to raise > Richard to a status of celebrity, so he could communicate with the > masses.  
> As the weeks progressed, his theories got more and more extreme and > paranoid. A lot of it surrounded 2012, and the possibility of there > being an apocalyptic moment. Richard likes to talk a lot about the > possibility of the Sun erupting in a large-scale solar flare that > wipes out the Earth. It got to the point where he was really pressing > me, saying we’re running out of time, we’re running out of time, the > end of the world is coming. And we have to take necessary precautions > to make sure that we’re not among the majority that’s going to be > killed.

These are not atypical beliefs among a certain set of “seekers.” Basically their world-view is constrained by their own imagination, their psychological needs, as well as particular factors of social pressure and expectation. They concentrate in certain towns and regions, such as [Sedona, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona). We’ll be hearing a lot about [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon) in the next few years.
