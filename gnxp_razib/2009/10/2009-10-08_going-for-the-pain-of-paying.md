Going for the pain of paying

[For Gun-Shy Consumers, Debit Is Replacing Credit](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/06/AR2009100603841.html?hpid=topnews#):

> Visa announced this spring that spending on Visa debit cards in the > United States surpassed credit for the first time in the company’s > history. In 2008, debit payment volume was \$206 billion, compared > with credit volume of \$203 billion. MasterCard reported that for the > first six months of this year, the volume of purchases on its debit > cards increased 4.1 percent, to \$160 billion, in the United States. > Spending on credit and charge cards sank 14.8 percent, to \$233 > billion.

I think really what’s going on here is that people are embracing the pain of paying; when you decouple time of payment from what you’re purchasing that tends to result in more purchase than would otherwise be the case. A perfectly rational individual wouldn’t need to make a distinction between debit and credit, what does it matter if you pay for a latte tomorrow (that is, it comes out of your account tomorrow) vs. the next billing cycle? No, **people are rational about the fact that they are irrational.** Pay later = buy more, pay tomorrow = buy less. If you want to buy less then heighten the immediacy of the cost.
