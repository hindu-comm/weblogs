Menopause with a purpose

[Virpi Lummaa](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com&q=virpi+lummaa&sitesearch=gnxp.com&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g2) is at it again, [Fitness benefits of prolonged post-reproductive lifespan in women](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6979/abs/nature02367.html):

> Using complete multi-generational demographic records, we show that > women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more > grandchildren, and hence greater fitness, in pre-modern populations of > both Finns and Canadians.

The effect of a grandmother being around seems to be \~10% increase in the survival likelihood of grandchildren. Not trivial.

**Update:** Yep, it’s an old paper. If you haven’t read it, still work checking out Lummaa’s work.
