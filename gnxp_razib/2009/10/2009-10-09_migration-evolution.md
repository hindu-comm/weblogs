Migration & evolution

[Evolution with Stochastic Fitness and Stochastic Migration](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007130):

> As has previously been shown with selection, the role of migration in > evolution is determined by the entire distributions of immigration and > emigration rates, not just by the mean values. The interactions of > stochastic migration with stochastic selection produce evolutionary > processes that are invisible to deterministic evolutionary theory.

I haven’t read the paper yet, but on my “To-Read” list….
