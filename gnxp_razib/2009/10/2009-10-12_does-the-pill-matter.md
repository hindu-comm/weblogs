Does the pill matter?

Eric Michael Johnson has a post up, [Does Taking Birth Control Alter Women’s Sexual Choices?](http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/10/does_taking_birth_control_alte.php), where he surveys a new paper,[Does the contraceptive pill alter mate choice in humans?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VJ1-4XDCKP8-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a24e85c788fb2b2b46e628b0fe507ddf). Eric notes:
