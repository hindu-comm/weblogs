The James Patterson of science fiction

Is [Harry Turtledove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Turtledove#List_of_Books_and_Series)? Compare the similarity in [output to Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Patterson#Bibliography). I just noticed that [Glenn Reynolds](http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/86693/) received a copy of Turtledove’s second book in a [quasi-alternate history series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765317125?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwviolentkicom&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0765317125wwwviolentkicom) he’s been working on. Turtledove shines when he’s applying what he knows. Even if the [Videssos cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videssos_cycle) wasn’t artful prose, the books had plots which moved along, while his historical, [Justinian](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812545273/geneexpressio-20), had [incredible source material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_II) to work with. But a lot of his more recent production just crawls along, rather like the later books in [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time). Additionally, I have to say that some of it definitely has an almost [Terry Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Brooks#Shannara_series) sensibility of mixing & matching plot and character modules instead of crafting the narratives in a more organic fashion.  
**Note:** [Piers Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Piers_Anthony#Series) could arguably be the James Patterson of science fiction as well, but he seems to have turned himself into a totally marginal figure for those beyond the age of 11 at this point.
