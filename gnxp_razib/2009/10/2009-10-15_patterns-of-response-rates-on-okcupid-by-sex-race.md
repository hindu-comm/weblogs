Patterns of response rates on OkCupid by sex & race

![replyrate.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/replyrate.png?resize=300%2C613)![replyrate.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/replyrate.png?resize=300%2C613)In the [OkCupid](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/10/05/your-race-affects-whether-people-write-you-back/) post on response rates and race & sex there are two charts which show how males and females respond to inquiries of the opposite sex by race. So, you can see that black women on OkCupid respond positively to men in general, while women respond positively in particular to white men. In fact for many racial minorities women respond more positively to inquiries from white men than they do co-racialists (the same is not true of men). I suspect some of this has to do with the excess of men on OkCupid, combined with selection effects in terms of who joins OkCupid. OkCupid is generally a well-educated, liberal and younger set in general, but is probably more representative of whites than say Middle Easterners. Those who are Middle Eastern on OkCupid are more likely to be non-Muslim than would be th case in the general Middle Eastern American population (though last I checked, it still looks like the majority of American Arabs are not Muslim). For many ethnic and religious groups there are special tailored websites, like [JDate.com](http://www.jdate.com/) or [IndianDating.com](http://www.indiandating.com/). Though no doubt there are conservative Arab Muslims on OkCupid, it seems very likely that they’ll be underrepresented, while more assimilated Arabs from Christian backgrounds who aren’t especially preoccupied with dating *only* Maronite Lebanese (for example) might be likely to select OkCupid. Some of these individuals might be selecting OkCupid to get outside of that box, and therefore not respond as positively toward co-ethnics as one might presume.  
But I was wondering, what’s the correlation of patterns of response? For example, in terms of various racial groups of the opposite sex do white men and white women respond similarly? How about the patterns of white men and black women? And so on. So what I did was take the columns of the responses and simply ran correlations in a pairwise fashion. Below the fold is a table which outlines the correlations. Labels which are italicized are male, those which are bolded are female. Bolded numbers are same-race opposite-sex correlations (e.g., Indian male-Indian female). Gray boxes represent correlations of 0.80 or above. The fact that most of the correlations are positive, if often small, suggests there are underlying similarities in patterns of response. Not too surprising when we see the cross-racial preference for white men among women in general, as well as the much stronger race consciousness among women as opposed for men in their avowed dating strategies.  
Speaking of which, all I gotta say is that brown dudes are weird.

**Note:** Since these are correlations across columns, you’re seeing correlations of positive responses to inquries by x & y.
