Most people are not stupid (?)

More Singularity stuff. [I’m Not Saying People Are Stupid](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ax/im_not_saying_people_are_stupid/), says Eliezer Yudkowsky in response to my summary of his talk. The last line of his post says: “I’m here because I’m crazy,” says the patient, “not because I’m stupid.” So the issue is craziness, not stupidity in Eliezer’s reading. The problem I would say is that stupid people have the “Not Even Crazy” problem. They often can’t get beyond their basic cognitive biases because they don’t have a good grasp of a rational toolkit, nor are they comfortable and fluent in analysis and abstraction. I can grant that many smart people are wrong or crazy, but at least there’s a hope of having them internalize [Bayes’ rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem).
