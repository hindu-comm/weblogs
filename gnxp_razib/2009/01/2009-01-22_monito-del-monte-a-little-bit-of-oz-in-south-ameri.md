Monito del Monte, a little bit of Oz in South America

![1182356555_extras_ladillos\_.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/1182356555_extras_ladillos_.jpg?resize=150%2C195)![1182356555_extras_ladillos\_.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/1182356555_extras_ladillos_.jpg?resize=150%2C195)The [Monito del Monte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monito_del_Monte) is the only extant member of its order, the [Microbiotheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiotheria). This order is itself part of the superorder [Australidelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australidelphia), which includes Australian Marsupials and the Monito del Monte, whose native habitat are the forests of Chile and Argentina. In other words, the Monito del Monte is more closely related to the Marsupials of Australia than to those of the New World.
