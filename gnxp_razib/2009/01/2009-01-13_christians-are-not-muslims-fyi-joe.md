Christians are not Muslims, FYI Joe

This [Joe Klein](http://swampland.blogs.time.com/2009/01/12/obamas-middle-east-advisers/) post where he points out that there is a lack of ethnic balance in Obama’s rumored Middle East advisors is getting some play:

I’d also suggest that Pete Mansoor, a > Palestinian-American who recently retired from the U.S. Army–he served > on David Petraeus’s Baghdad team–would be an excellent staffer.

I know that Fawaz Gerges is from an [Christian background](https://fakirsca.blogspot.com/2009/01/book-review-journey-of-jihadist-by.html) (the surname is a quick clue if you didn’t know ahead of time). Shibley Telhami’s name suggested to me that he was likely to be a non-Muslim, and it turns out that he too is an [Arab Christian](http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Telhami/telhami-con1.html). If you’re a good Bayesian you’ll of course assume that there’s a higher probability that any Arab intellectual or thinker a non-Muslim would know is more likely to be from a Christian background (because Christian Arabs assimilate into Western culture to a higher degree than Muslim Arabs). This kind of stuff is stupid, though I’ve seen plenty of people do it in the past. Makes “pundits” look like retards frankly, though I don’t see any of Joe Klein’s 20 commenters pointing out the problem with his assertion, so they’re probably just ignorant. Some people might wonder if I’m being pedantic. Well, some people are imprecise retards. Confusing Arab Christians and Muslims is just retarded. The insanity has to stop somewhere. **Use google. Know something about the world before you open your mouth!**

  
(yes, I’m telling you what I think)  
**P.S.** You’re also dumb if you think Persians are Arabs. Some of Klein’s moronic commenters are complaining that you’d need Persians in Obama’s circle, **but one of the individuals Klein identified as a Muslim (correctly), [Vali Nasr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vali_Nasr), is Persian.** Like Joe they’re getting the categories of Muslim and Arab confused, and since Vali was identified as Muslim they assumed he was Arab (while the other two are Arabs, but not Muslim). Retards.  
**Note:** I said Christian background because many Arabs from Christian backgrounds might not be religious at all. Edward Said for example was an atheist from a Christian background who identified as an Arab whose civilization was Islam (how’s that for a mouthful?). My own suspicion is that Vali Nasr is not an orthodox Muslim at all, as [his father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyyed_Hossein_Nasr) has connections with [perennialist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy).
