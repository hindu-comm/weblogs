Our Lord & Savior

There is a new blog on *ScienceBlogs*, [Blogging the Origin](http://scienceblogs.com/bloggingtheorigin/), which is going over [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451529065/geneexpressio-20/). Because this is the [Darwin bicentenary](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/01/darwin-overload-alert.php) there is going to be a lot of the reflection upon the legacy of the great man; e.g., [Blog For Darwin](http://citizenship.typepad.com/blogfordarwin/). I have to admit that I haven’t read [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451529065/geneexpressio-20/) since I was a child, when I didn’t understand evolution with any level of precision, so I plan to reread Darwin’s oeuvre at some point this year for my own edification. I also recommend the [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/darwin/inourtime.shtml) Darwin retrospective; just subscribe to “In Our Time” in iTunes and you can get the 4 programs as podcasts.
