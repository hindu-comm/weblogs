Pajamas Media goes down….

Well, it isn’t just the old media that’s having issues. A few days ago [Culture11](http://culture11.com/blogs/theconfabulum/2009/01/28/the-fate-of-culture11/) folded. Now it looks like [Pajamas Media](http://proteinwisdom.com/?p=14222) network is shutting down (they’re going to go into vlogging fulltime?). I got a few links from PM back in 2005-2006, very little traffic. It didn’t seem like the aggregation was adding any value to the constituent weblogs. Additionally, a lot of their stuff is 2001-2004 vintage Right-of-Center media commentary, the sell-by date has long passed. Something like [The Next Right](http://www.thenextright.com/) is what circa 2010 conservative weblogs are going to look like, at least the good ones. Look at this [DJ Drummond](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/pollsters-did-great-job.php) [level of idiocy last fall](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/its-all-coming-down-to-a-few-key-states/) at PM:

As you can [see for yourself](http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/its-all-coming-down-to-a-few-key-states/2/#comment-4), I was curious as to whether this “analysis” was a joke or not. Obama beat McCain by 25 points in New York….
