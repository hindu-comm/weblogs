Daddy's Skeleton Army

Someone has suggested that the cover of our new book (the [10,000 year explosion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465002218/geneexpressio-20/)) symbolizes the splitting of the human race into different species. I will award a metaphorical cigar to the first person who figures out what it \_really\_ means.

(Daddyâ€™s Skeleton Army is the alternate title suggested by my son Ben)
