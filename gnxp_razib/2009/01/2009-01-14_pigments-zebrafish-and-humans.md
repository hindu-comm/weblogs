Pigments: zebrafish and humans

About 3 years ago a paper was published on pigmentation which heralded the breaking of the dam when it comes to skin color genetics, [SLC24A5, a Putative Cation Exchanger, Affects Pigmentation in Zebrafish and Humans](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/310/5755/1782). The zebrafish, a model organism familiar to evo-devoists the world over, played an important role in the paper. The new issue of [Zebrafish](http://www.liebertonline.com/toc/zeb/5/4?cookieSet=1) is totally devoted to pigmentation. The press release was kind of weird, [Zebrafish Journal Publishes Skin Pigmentation Studies That Shed Light on the Evolution of Race](http://sev.prnewswire.com/publishing-information-services/20090114/NY5902714012009-1.html):

> “With the election of the first African-American president of the > United States, our society has taken a landmark step towards > deracializing human conduct,” says Stephen C. Ekker, PhD, Rochester, > MN, Editor-in-Chief of Zebrafish. “As scientists, we contribute to > this work by sharing genetic insights to demystify skin color and > race.”

OK…. In any case, there are two papers (both OA) that readers might find interesting. [Skin Color in Fish and Humans: Impacts on Science and Society](http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/zeb.2008.0577):

> As genetic model systems, fish have played a key role in our > understanding of a wide range of biological processes, including > vertebrate pigmentation. In this review, we focus on one aspect of > pigmentation, skin pigmentation, which has been of momentous > importance in human history. Two fish models, medaka and zebrafish, > played important roles in demystifying skin color and, by extension, > the concept of “race.” Related thinking has the potential to make two > additional contributions to human welfare. Fish can be used to > validate gene candidates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) > in what has been called “Systems Genetics.” Because fish are familiar > vertebrates, and share genetic mechanisms of skin color with humans, > they also have outstanding potential as an educational tool–to > “demystify” race, to increase public understanding of the role of > model systems and evolution in science, and to enhance appreciation of > both genetic and environmental factors that impact human health and > society.

And, [U.S. Scientists’ Role in the Eugenics Movement (1907-1939): A Contemporary Biologist’s Perspective](http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/zeb.2008.0576).
