By other means necessary?

My friend Aziz Poonawalla has a post up, [is evolution sufficient?](http://blog.beliefnet.com/cityofbrass/2009/01/is-evolution-sufficient.html) No, it’s not the standard Creationist cant:

> It seems that if we aren’t mutating at a rate comparable to above, > then some sort of alternative mechanism must also be operating to > accelerate the changes in DNA required to evolve from one species to > another. **There’s certainly some evidence that there are such > “neo-Lamarckian” processes at work**, The case of the humble > water-flea certainly is not explicable by normal Darwinian processes.

The general question is tackled in 10,000 Year Explosion. I haven’t kept up on the literature of human evolution in the context of our separation from the lineage that led up to chimpanzees to comment in detail, but the big issue I would say to a physicist like Aziz is that **there more degrees of freedom in biology than can imagined in your philosophy my friend!** Leave a comment over at Aziz’s.
