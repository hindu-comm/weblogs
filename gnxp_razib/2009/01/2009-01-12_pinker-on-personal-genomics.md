Pinker on personal genomics

[Everyone](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/01/personal_genomics_pinker_23and.php) [is](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/01/steven_pinker_and_the_diversif.php) [talking](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/testing/pinker-hot-legs-2009.html) about [Steven Pinker’s article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11Genome-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=magazine) in the NY Times on his experiences toying with results from personal genomics companies [Counsyl](http://counsyl.com/) and [23andme](https://www.23andme.com/). The article is, like most of Pinker’s writing, entertaining and scientifically legit; well worth a read.

One interesting point to notice is that the different companies involved in this nascent field (I find Razib’s analogy to the early computer industry apt) are taking very different angles; there’s been something of an adaptive radiation into these new niches (ie. 23andme going for the social networking approach, Counsyl a more medical one, etc.) My impression is this is likely to be overall a good thing for people who, of course, will have varied ideas of the type of data that piques their interest.
