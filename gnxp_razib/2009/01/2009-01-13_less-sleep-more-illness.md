Less sleep = more illness?

[Sleep Habits and Susceptibility to the Common Cold](http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/169/1/62):

> There was a graded association with average sleep duration: > **participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were 2.94 times…more > likely to develop a cold than those with 8 hours or more of sleep.** > The association with sleep efficiency was also graded: participants > with less than 92% efficiency were 5.50 times …more likely to develop > a cold than those with 98% or more efficiency. These relationships > could not be explained by differences in prechallenge virus-specific > antibody titers, demographics, season of the year, body mass, > socioeconomic status, psychological variables, or health practices. > The percentage of days feeling rested was not associated with colds.

Even if there’s a big confound that they haven’t accounted for, this is a large effect. It also goes along with our intuitions and common sense. There are plenty other correlations between less sleep and illness out there, but respiratory illness is a great proximate dampener on productivity for many of us.
