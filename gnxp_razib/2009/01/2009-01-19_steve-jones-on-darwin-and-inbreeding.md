Steve Jones on Darwin and Inbreeding

A long article by Steve Jones [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jan/19/charles-darwin) from today’s Guardian. (But ignore the rather feeble first paragraph. I doubt that ‘every schoolchild’ has as many ideas about Darwin – whether true or false – as this suggests.)
