Everyone is talking about this piece in *The New York Times*. I kept thinking about the book [The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001CBD5OE/geneexpressio-20). As China urbanizes and shifts away from agriculture I actually wonder if there is going to be a ‘re-wilding of large areas due to reforestation.
