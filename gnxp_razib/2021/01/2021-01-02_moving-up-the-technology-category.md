Moving up the “technology” category

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-03-00-23-27.jpg?resize=154%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-03-00-23-27.jpg?resize=154%2C300&ssl=1)](https://substack.com/)Believe it or not, my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) is now \#8 for paid newsletters in the “Technology” category. Substack allows you to put in three categories. I selected Genetics, History, and Technology. Technology is the only tag that is being reported for the leader board, so there I am. I really wish there was a “Science” option, but there isn’t (I’ve complained to Substack about this).

I justify my inclusion there because I will be talking now and then about [genomics and genetic engineering](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-age-of-genetic-engineering-begins), and these are technologies. If I focused more on technology I could certainly charge more, since it would be industry relevant. But I really do enjoy writing about [Zhou China](https://razib.substack.com/p/3000-years-of-chinese-history) and talking to scholars such as [Armand Leroi](https://razib.substack.com/p/armand-leroi-an-evolutionist-in-repose), so I will continue to keep it a “dilettante’s corner.”

The leader right now is my friend [Byrne Hobart’s The Diff](https://diff.substack.com/?utm_source=discover). Some of the stuff he writes about is pretty incredible.
