So now in sync with [Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom: China, the West, and the Epic Story of the Taiping Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20). The book club is back on as a dual-core/two-cylinder enterprise.

[Thailand reports 829 new coronavirus cases](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thailand-reports-829-coronavirus-cases-043525184.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr). Thailand seems like it is losing control! I hope not.

[Not Yet Desperate, Japan and South Korea Plod Toward Vaccinations](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/japan-south-korea-vaccinations.html?smid=tw-share). Hard to second-guess Japan and South Korea. They figured things out early.

See this report in *WSJ*, [The NFL’s Covid-19 Finding That Saved the Season](https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-nfl-covid-cdc-11612104460?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter). “The virus, in some instances, traveled farther than six feet—especially in small, poorly ventilated areas. And masks, more than the duration of contact, seemed to matter a lot.”

It’s 1 hour and 40 minutes. We talk about a lot of issues, including what it was like to be multi-regionalism-friendly and arguing for adaptive introgression in humans in the 2000’s, to his stand against the Reich-Willerslev duopoly in ancient DNA. I’ve known John for fifteen years, so we had a lot to talk about.

This is for [subscribers](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe), so a two-week delay to being posted on [Unsupervised Learning](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/).

[Hinduism is not false consciousness , it is “Planet X”](https://www.brownpundits.com/2021/01/29/hinduism-is-not-false-consciousness-it-is-planet-x/). Some Indians have the same fixation as modern Western elites on language as the key to reality, rather than language being a tool to describe reality. Hinduism wasn’t “invented” when it was named. The name put a label on something that was already there.

I was a guest on a YouTube show about ancient history. The episode is titled [Sumerian Origins and Ancient DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56awVoGwAA). Apparently, Reddit’s anthropology channel refused to post it because they didn’t want to platform me after reading the Undark hit piece. Journalism, isn’t it a great profession?
