It’s a short book that compiles the experiences and recollections of Muslim merchants from the Persian Gulf who traveled to Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and China. There’s a lot of interesting stuff, but, **many of the observations hold up.**

There are some hilarious sections about how Indians won’t eat off each other’s plates. This is, in fact, a tendency of modern people from the subcontinent (of all religions).

I’ve written two long essays for Substack now:

– [Stark Truth About Aryans: a story of India](https://razib.substack.com/p/stark-truth-about-aryans-a-story)  
– [Stark Truth About Humans: a story of India](https://razib.substack.com/p/stark-truth-about-humans-a-story)

Both are for [paid subscribers](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe), sorry not sorry. Nearly 10,000 words between the two of them.

I talked to [Ramesh Ponnuru about the pro-life movement in America](https://razib.substack.com/p/ramesh-ponnuru-on-the-pro-life-movement). I will ungate it to everyone in two weeks. My [conversation](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/alina-chan-on-sars-cov-2-and-lab-leak) with Alina Chan is now live on the free site.

[Scott Alexander](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/?utm_source=discover) is back. I heard through a friend that last summer an academic got a call about Alexander, and it was clear that the reporter was a hostile (the academic refused to cooperate).

[Finally in 3-D: A Dinosaur’s All-Purpose Orifice](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/science/dinosaur-cloaca-fossil.html?surface=home-discovery-vi-prg&fellback=false&req_id=946404685&algo=identity&variant=no-exp&imp_id=636554416).

[A Bitter Archaeological Feud Over an Ancient Vision of the Cosmos](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/science/nebra-sky-disk.html).

[The information warriors fighting ‘robot zombie army’ of coronavirus sceptics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/the-information-warriors-fighting-robot-zombie-army-of-coronavirus-sceptics). My friends Stuart Ritchie and Sam Bowman.

[Natural Selection in Contemporary Humans is Linked to Income and Substitution Effects](https://ideas.repec.org/p/uea/ueaeco/2021-02.html). Dr. Appie of course.

[Local adaptations of Mediterranean sheep and goats through an integrative approach](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.427461v1).

[How Beijing Turned China’s Covid-19 Tragedy to Its Advantage](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/business/china-covid-19-beijing.html?smid=tw-share)
