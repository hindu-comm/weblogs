What Sahul tells us about world genetic history

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/msab238f4.jpeg?resize=640%2C478&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/msab238f4.jpeg?resize=640%2C478&ssl=1)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/11/5107/6349182?login=true)  
The paper [Papua New Guinean Genomes Reveal the Complex Settlement of North Sahul](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/11/5107/6349182?login=true) came out a few months ago. It’s fine. But one thing jumped out at me:

Around 50 ka, > estimated effective population sizes for populations from Wallacea and > Sahul are between 1,671 and 2,100 individuals, and between 2,540 and > 2,999 individuals in Eurasia and 9,506 individuals in Africa.

First, the bottleneck precedes the massive expansion after 60 ka. Second, perhaps there was Eurasian back-migration into Africa and that’s impacting the difference coalescence dates? Basically, the Yoruba can be thought as a population strongly influenced by “out-of-Africa” gene flow.
