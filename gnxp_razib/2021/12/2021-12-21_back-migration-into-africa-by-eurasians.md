Back migration into Africa by Eurasians

Two preprints/papers.

[Identifying and Interpreting Apparent Neanderthal Ancestry in African Individuals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420300593):

Basically, this paper concludes that Eurasian back-migration related to Europeans/West Asians seems to be around 30% of Sub-Saharan African ancestry. They carry about 30% of the Neanderthal ancestry of Eurasians.

Then, a preprint that uses a pretty sophisticated method, [Ancient Admixture into Africa from the ancestors of non-Africans](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.127555v1):

This paper estimates 35-40% back-migration from the ancestral proto-Eurasian population, with less (\~20%) in African hunter-gatherers. This paper didn’t detect Neanderthal ancestry and argues that the back-migration predates the West vs East Eurasian split. It plausibly argues African effective population sizes are inflated by the admixture event.

The two results here clearly contradict the details.
