Women at war

The new *Wheel of Time* television show has a scene where an Aiel woman totally smashes a half a dozen male soldiers with her skilled usage of her spears (this deployment of spears comes from the books, where the Aiel women do fight). The scene was well done overall, and some pathos was added by the fact that she was in labor (this is from the book too). But watching it I couldn’t help but think of this piece, [Male and Female Athletic Performance: Worlds Apart](https://quillette.com/2021/12/11/male-and-female-athletic-performance/). Here’s a relevant chart:

Here are the ones that jumped out to me re: male strength advantage:

– Grip strength, 57%

– Total upper strength, 90%

– Punch power, 162%

It’s a fantasy TV show. But I really hope that people aren’t taking the wrong lessons from this. I remember here some idiotic Late Night TV
show host asking Scarlett Johansson how she fought so well, and ScarJo laughed it off and said “they make me seem tough,” as she found the question ludicrous.
