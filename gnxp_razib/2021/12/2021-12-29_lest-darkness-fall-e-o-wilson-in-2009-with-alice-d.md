Lest darkness fall: E. O. Wilson in 2009 with Alice Dreger

Academic culture is far more radical, political, and a lot of people with courage or openness to heterodoxy are just exiting, leaving the field to the most authoritarian personalities. It’s really strange to me that she published right before “the Great Awokening.” She has timing, that’s for sure.

It’s hard to remember, but when a journalist wrote a libelous book about Napoleon Chagnon in 2000, most scientists [criticized the author and the work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_in_El_Dorado). I don’t think that would be the case today, as the presumption of guilt would be on Chagnon and James Neel. I read about this controversy in *Salon*, a very left-wing magazine, and the piece was broadly sympathetic to Chagnon and Neel. 2000 was different. It gets worst, sometimes.

Today Dreger published her conversation with E. O. Wilson from 2009 in *Quillette*. It’s an interesting read **because Wilson clearly had no idea that in 2009 he was speaking during the last gasp of an intellectual interglacial.** The beginning of the [piece](https://quillette.com/2021/12/29/speaking-with-e-o-wilson/) makes his naivete clear:

> **Alice Dreger:** I know you’ve spoken about it many times before, but > I would like to begin by asking you about the session at the 1978 AAAS > \[American Association for the Advancement of Science\] conference > during which you were rushed on the stage and a protester emptied a > pitcher of water onto your head.

I was actually assaulted at the 2013 ASHG on account of my ideology (the grad student made his reasoning plain during an earlier hour of drunken harassment), and something similar almost happened the next year in 2014 (but I had taken precautions after 2013 so people wouldn’t hassle me). So I had that in common with him. I’m sure there are plenty of others out there.

History is clearly on his side in the long term. But in the long-term we’re all dead. History is not Whiggish in the short term. The openness of 2009 was gone by 2019, and definitely by 2021.

Read the whole thing. There’s a lot of juicy stuff about how Dick Lewontin and S. J.Gould operated. Gould’s sliminess wasn’t really political, as much as it was personal. He wanted to be the glamorous celebrity scientist, which he did become. The particular point that Lewontin sent activists to harass other professors at Harvard in the 1970’s is interesting because there are a thousand Lewontins operating in academia now. The future belongs to him, and not the likes of Wilson. I’m heartened to see so many people praising Wilson online this week. But to be honest most of those people would avert their eyes, just like Wilson’s colleagues did in the 1970’s, if the Dick Lewontins of the day came after the Wilsons of 2021 (who are frankly all mostly closeted anyway).

It is pretty well known that Wilson was instrumental in getting Lewontin hired at Harvard. But the interview in *Quillette*is painful to read when he outlines how it all played out, and Wilson’s innocence is pretty clear:

> I’ll tell you a story about all of this. Around 1970, we were > searching for someone in population genetics. He looked very good > then. And he had this brilliant personality in conversation, this > brilliant presentation, a real theatrical power. The search committee > decided he was the best person, but this was after he had just adopted > his political and public persona and he was known to be joining > protests.

> We had a meeting to take the final vote on Lewontin at Harvard, and a > group of the older professors said they were worried about reports of > his behavior at Chicago—that he might be disruptive or might have > gotten away from genetics, and so would not be the right sort of > person to be at Harvard.

There are plenty of Lewontin characters today. The main difference now is a lot of people, including some people who are friends, say “that’s good actually.” Unlike Wilson’s day there’s no need to worry about political considerations, everyone knows that only certain types of political ideologies are acceptable. It’s open now in a way that one doesn’t even need to say it. What is agreed by all needs to be spoken of by no one.
