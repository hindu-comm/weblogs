Pausing research on autism (for now)

[High-profile autism genetics project paused amid backlash](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02602-7):

> But soon after the study’s high-profile launch on 24 August, autistic > people and some ASD researchers expressed concern that it had gone > ahead without meaningfully consulting the autism community. Fears > about the sharing of genetic data and an alleged failure to properly > explain the benefits of the research have been raised by a group > called Boycott Spectrum 10K, which is led by autistic people. The > group plans to protest outside the ARC premises in Cambridge in > October. A separate petition against the study gathered more than > 5,000 signatures. >

I assume they’ll restart, but this sort of research will happen somewhere. Autism is a reasonably heritable trait, and many of the people with autism are not “high functioning.”
