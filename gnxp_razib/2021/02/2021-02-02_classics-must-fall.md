Classics must fall!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final_pagan.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final_pagan.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00Q6B7FXW/geneexpressio-20)A very long piece in *New York Times Magazine*, [He Wants to Save Classics From Whiteness. Can the Field Survive? – Dan-el Padilla Peralta thinks classicists should knock ancient Greece and Rome off their pedestal — even if that means destroying their discipline](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/magazine/classics-greece-rome-whiteness.html). There is obviously some self-interestedness from those who would defend Classics when they are Classicists. Ian Morris and Walter Scheidel, both of whom I respect, don’t think much of the field (though both have some association with it).

I feel the piece tried to break it down into a binary when the reality is more complex.

My own comment would be to repeat Terrence:

*“Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto”*  
“I am human, and I think nothing human is alien to me”
