Lewontin’s Paradox in the 21st century

Revisiting Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.429633v1):

> Under neutral theory, the level of polymorphism in an equilibrium > population is expected to increase with population size. However, > observed levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of > magnitude, while census population sizes (Nc) are expected to vary > over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is a > longstanding enigma in evolutionary genetics known as Lewontin’s > Paradox of Variation (1974). Since Lewontin’s observation, it has been > argued that selection constrains diversity across species, yet tests > of this hypothesis seem to fall short of explaining the > orders-of-magnitude reduction in diversity observed in nature. In this > work, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox and assess whether current models > of linked selection are likely to constrain diversity to this extent. > To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census > population sizes across species, I combine genetic data from 172 > metazoan taxa with estimates of census sizes from geographic > occurrence data and population densities estimated from body mass. > Next, I fit the relationship between previously-published estimates of > genomic diversity and these approximate census sizes to quantify > Lewontin’s Paradox. While previous across-taxa population genetic > studies have avoided accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, I > use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the diversity > census size relationship, estimate phylogenetic signal, and explore > how diversity changes along the phylogeny. I consider whether the > reduction in diversity predicted by models of recurrent hitchhiking > and background selection could explain the observed pattern of > diversity across species. Since the impact of linked selection is > mediated by recombination map length, I also investigate how map > lengths vary with census sizes. I find species with large census sizes > have shorter map lengths, leading these species to experience greater > reductions in diversity due to linked selection. Even after using high > estimates of the strength of sweeps and background selection, I find > linked selection likely cannot explain the shortfall between predicted > and observed diversity levels across metazoan species. Furthermore, > the predicted diversity under linked selection does not fit the > observed diversity–census-size relationship, implying that processes > other than background selection and recurrent hitchhiking must be > limiting diversity.
