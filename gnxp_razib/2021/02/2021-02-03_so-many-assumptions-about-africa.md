So many assumptions about Africa

I have been staring and this figure and rereading [Ancient West African foragers in the context of African population history](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/Shum_Laka_published.pdf). The Shum Laka sample from this paper, dating to four to eight thousand years ago, have drawn my attention, and I’m just looking at them a lot.

**It seems ridiculous I’ve been using Nigerians as my “African reference” for decades.** Most African populations, including Pygmies and Khoisan, have Eurasian admixture from the last 10,000 years. And what about deeper back-to-Africa ancestry? That seems likely and is hinted at in the above paper.

Modern human lineages have a deep history in Africa and the Near East. I think we’re going to have a transformation of our understanding of what happened in these regions in the near future.
