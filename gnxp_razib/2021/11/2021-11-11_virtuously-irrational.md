Virtuously irrational

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/download.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07L2HQ26K//geneexpressio-20)I have a [review](https://quillette.com/2021/11/10/the-scout-mindset-a-review/) of [The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07L2HQ26K//geneexpressio-20) up over at [Quillette](https://quillette.com/2021/11/10/the-scout-mindset-a-review/). The book begins with the [Dreyfus affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair), and I didn’t really get to highlight one of the most interesting aspects of this.

For those who don’t know, [Alfred Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dreyfus) was a French Jewish officer who was framed for espionage and subsequently exonerated. Julia Galef, the author of [The Scout Mindset](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07L2HQ26K//geneexpressio-20), points out that one of the major reasons that Dreyfus was exonerated was the persistence of [Georges Picquart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Picquart), chief of the army’s intelligence section, in exposing the true spy. Picquart was a conservative, and conventionally anti-Semitic as was typical of Frenchmen of his day and class. He did not have a strong motive to exonerate Dreyfus, but he held to his conviction that the case was wrongly decided once he couldn’t deny the facts. Like Dreyfus, Picquart also faced serious consequences, including court-martial. His reputation was repaired when Dreyfus was let go thanks to the effort of [Émile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola#Dreyfus_affair).

Here is the conundrum at the heart of Picquart’s behavior: **was it rational for him to hold to the truth against his self-interest**? I’m not sure it was, at least conventionally understood. One of the aspects of human nature, and human history, is that people do the right thing, the virtuous thing, even in the fact of negative consequences. If they didn’t, I’m not sure we’d have a civilization.
