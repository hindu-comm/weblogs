T: The Story of Testosterone, the Hormone that Dominates and Divides Us

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71sKlP5zFEL.jpg?resize=197%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/71sKlP5zFEL.jpg?resize=197%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08HKX6GWH/geneexpressio-20)[Carole Hooven](https://twitter.com/hoovlet) has a new book, [T: The Story of Testosterone, the Hormone that Dominates and Divides Us](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08HKX6GWH/geneexpressio-20). I’ll be honest and admit I was only vaguely aware of the book until yesterday when a social media controversy erupted over her “transphobic comments” on Fox & Friends. You can watch the [clip yourself](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6265580505001/), and see that she’s not transphobic at all.

I assume though the accusation will be enough to open some Title IX complaints. Unless her colleagues step up I assume she’ll be hounded out by the bureaucracy, though I hope I’m wrong.

Hooven has been all over the media, just see what she’s RTed on her [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/hoovlet). She makes it pretty clear she’s not going to back down on the scientific questions and answers. Which is how it should be, but that sort of stance is far less common than groveling obeisance before the new red guards.
