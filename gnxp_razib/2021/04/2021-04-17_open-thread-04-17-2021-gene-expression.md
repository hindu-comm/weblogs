The focus is on the silk road, 2,000 years ago.

Also, rereading David Anthony’s [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20). It’s a good book and stands the test of time. We know so much from ancient DNA it’s more rewarding to read, not less.

[Pantheon: A New History of Roman Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074448DHZ/geneexpressio-20). Dense but informative.
