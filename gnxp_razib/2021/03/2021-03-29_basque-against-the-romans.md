Basque against the Romans

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/basque-people-1024x682-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/basque-people-1024x682-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1)  
[Genetic origins, singularity, and heterogeneity of Basques](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(21)00349-3):

> Basques have historically lived along the Western Pyrenees, in the > Franco-Cantabrian region, straddling the current Spanish and French > territories. Over the last decades, they have been the focus of > intense research due to their singular cultural and biological traits > that, with high controversy, placed them as a heterogeneous, isolated, > and unique population. Their non-Indo-European language, Euskara, is > thought to be a major factor shaping the genetic landscape of the > Basques. Yet there is still a lively debate about their history and > assumed singularity due to the limitations of previous studies. Here, > we analyze genome-wide data of Basque and surrounding groups that do > not speak Euskara at a micro-geographical level. A total of ∼629,000 > genome-wide variants were analyzed in 1,970 modern and ancient > samples, including 190 new individuals from 18 sampling locations in > the Basque area. For the first time, local- and wide-scale analyses > from genome-wide data have been performed covering the whole > Franco-Cantabrian region, combining allele frequency and > haplotype-based methods. Our results show a clear differentiation of > Basques from the surrounding populations, with the > non-Euskara-speaking Franco-Cantabrians located in an intermediate > position. Moreover, a sharp genetic heterogeneity within Basques is > observed with significant correlation with geography. Finally, the > detected Basque differentiation cannot be attributed to an external > origin compared to other Iberian and surrounding populations. Instead, > we show that such differentiation results from genetic continuity > since the Iron Age, characterized by periods of isolation and lack of > recent gene flow that might have been reinforced by the language > barrier.

The main takeaway seems to be that Basque distinctiveness dates to the Roman period.
