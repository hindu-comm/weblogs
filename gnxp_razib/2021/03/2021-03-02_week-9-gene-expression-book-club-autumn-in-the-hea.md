Week 9, Gene Expression Book Club, Autumn In The Heavenly Kingdom

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/autumnheavenly.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/autumnheavenly.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20)The armies of the Taiping and Imperial forces race to and fro, to and fro. To say that this part of the narrative does not feel linear to me is understating the issue. Much of the action continues to be centered on the lower Yangzi, but there are some deviations. This section of the book would benefit from maps. Lots of maps.

The key thing that stands out for me is the victories or losses. We already know the Taiping are going to lose. The question is how. But the brutality on all sides. And honor as well. An Imperial office is offered a position with the Taiping, he refuses and eventually is allowed to go back to his own side. Then, they execute him on suspicion of being a traitor. Captured soldiers are routinely massacred. Imperial generals berate their subordinates for not being brutal enough.

The chapter ends with a victory for the Imperial forces under [Zeng Guofan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan) despite a long night of the soul in various parts. The captured city has turned to cannibalism, and the civilians are mostly slaughtered because they had sided with the Taiping. The generals leading the Imperial side seem to justify their lack of mercy. Victory is a hard thing. But the fact that they write down justifications indicates that they’re not totally at peace with the brutality.
