[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/notbornyesterday.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/notbornyesterday.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07W62V5WP/geneexpressio-20)Reading chapter 9 of [Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and What We Believe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07W62V5WP/geneexpressio-20). Lots of stuff about the Nazis, so juicy. Will put the post up soon.

5,300-word piece up now on Substack: [They came, they saw, they left no trace…except for all of Western Civilization](https://razib.substack.com/p/they-came-they-saw-they-left-no-trace). This is focused on Italy from 1000 BC to 1000 AD. I interleave genetics and history. Even if you are not tempted to become a paid subscriber, do consider [signing up for free](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe). I’m devoting more and more of my content generation to Substack, and some of it is not paywalled (for example, my recent piece on the [Uyghurs](https://razib.substack.com/p/made-in-china)).

[In Hawaii, Reimagining Tourism for a Post-Pandemic World](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/travel/hawaii-covid-tourism.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage). I don’t believe it. But who knows?

[Human challenge trials with live coronavirus aren’t the answer to a Covid-19 vaccine](https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/23/challenge-trials-live-coronavirus-speedy-covid-19-vaccine/). From June 2020. I don’t think this ages well.

[NASA’s Perseverance Rover Lands on Mars to Renew Search for Extinct Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/science/nasa-peseverance-mars-landing.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

I’m experimenting with a site called [Indie Ocean](https://indieocean.io/razib). It’s basically a physical book storefront. You’ll recognize the list. Here is some [information on the project](https://indieocean.io/vision). I’ve been talking to them for months, so this isn’t out of the blue.

It looks like the pandemic is finally ending?
