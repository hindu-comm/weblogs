Darwin will fall

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/descentofman.jpg?resize=210%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/descentofman.jpg?resize=210%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07474P4SX/geneexpressio-20)Over at his Substack, [Robert Wright](https://nonzero.substack.com/p/the-truth-about-darwin) puts in a defense of Charles Darwin against a comment in *Science*, [“The Descent of Man,” 150 years on](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6544/769). On the whole, **I agree with Wright, and not with the author of the *Science* piece, Augustin Fuentes.** But, I will say that I’ve always found the hagiography and adulation given to Darwin the man a bit tiresome and overdone. This was probably taken to the most ridiculous extremes in [Darwin’s Sacred Cause: How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin’s Views on Human Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00PF1PX88/geneexpressio-20). Fuentes’ piece is somewhat hard to parse for me, but if he thinks that most students (as opposed to intellectual historians) should reflect on Darwin’s non and para-scientific views as if it’s worth their time, then he’s not super interested in the science. In many ways, Darwin was not an atypical exemplar of the English gentry of his period.

The reason we remember Darwin is **because of his exceptional science, not his unexceptional social views.** For Victorians, Darwin would have been viewed on the liberal or progressive side. But for our time he would seem hopelessly reactionary and problematic. That’s really all there is to it.

The analogy here I will use is Herbert Spencer, whose views were misrepresented by Richard Hofstadter in the 20th century. Today, most non-specialist intellectuals know Spencer through Hofstadter’s distortion, not Spencer’s primary works. Those who read Spencer in the original are often surprised at the extent of the misrepresentation, but attempts to correct the record are futile. No one cares nerd.

I believe that something similar may happen to Darwin. Many scientists know the truth and have read Darwin’s work. He’s a complex figure who is hard to position in the modern landscape, and reductive analyses often miss the mark. But most scientists have better things to do, at least in their opinion, than counter ridiculous propagandists. Additionally, those ridiculous propagandists are often fellow-travelers in far-Left politics, which saturates modern science. I believe that one day scientists will wake up, and come to understand that the lie has become the truth, and then they will have to make the choice whether to speak the true truth, as opposed to the socially expected false truth. I don’t think there’s any suspense in my guess as to what choice they’ll make.

Of course to understand the fullness of who Charles Darwin was you can read his works and his letters, and draw your own conclusions. But you will be the few. Most people will rely on the most lurid and misrepresentative letters posted as screenshots on Twitter.
