Fewer than 500 American children have died of COVID-19

There are 258 confirmed deaths of COVID-19 for children. This is probably an underestimate, but I doubt it’s a two-fold underestimate. There are [74 million Americans who are in this age range](https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp). For [comparison](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/asthma/learn-about-asthma/asthma-children-facts-sheet#:~:text=In%202016%2C%203%2C651%20deaths%20were,adults%20over%2085%20years%20old.), 169 children under 15 years old died of asthma in 2016. In [2018](https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/child_passenger_safety/cps-factsheet.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20motor,more%20than%2097%2C000%20were%20injured.) 636 children age 12 and under died in car accidents.

The reason I’m posting this is I still hear fears about children dying now and then. The main issue with children is the spread of the disease. That’s why adults should vaccinate.
