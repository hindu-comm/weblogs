Sydney Brenner to fat people: you’re a criminal!

![pd_bicycle_071204_ms.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/pd_bicycle_071204_ms.jpg?resize=150%2C113)![pd_bicycle_071204_ms.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/pd_bicycle_071204_ms.jpg?resize=150%2C113)Kambiz attended the [Humanity’s Genes and the Human Condition](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/seminars/fall08symposium/index.php), and [he reports](http://anthropology.net/2008/11/15/attending-humanitys-genes-and-the-human-condition-symposium/) some interesting goings on. [Sydney Brenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Brenner), Nobel Laureate 2002, had this to say this about human evolution:

> Starts off with a zinger: “Biological evolution for humans has > stopped.” Uhh, really Sydney? You better do better than that. He uses > an analogy about how if we feel cold, we don’t ‘adapt’ we just kill an > animal, skin it, and wear its pelt as evidence of relaxed natural > selection.

I wonder if this the malevolent influence of [Steve Jones](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=steve+jones+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search), but I doubt it. But that wasn’t the weird stuff:

> Obesity! Lists how our hypothalamus drives us to eat more and convert > to fat which means our genomes are mal-adapted to the current cultural > environment. Jokes that obesity should be a crime. **He points out > Alta Charo, the previous speaker on Ethics & Epigenetics. Says she > must be jailed and forced to cycle to generate electricity.** Sydney > advocates that this will kill two birds with one stone, obesity and > the energy crisis. There are some uncomfortable laughs. The joke isn’t > being taken that well.

Looks like Berkeley just needs to keep old Nobel Laureates away from speaking at conferences. From [eight years ago](http://www.mindfully.org/GE/James-Watson-Racist-Sexist.htm), [Nobel Winner’s Theories Raise Uproar in Berkeley  
Geneticist’s views strike many as racist, sexist](http://www.mindfully.org/GE/James-Watson-Racist-Sexist.htm):

> “Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know > you’re not going to hire them,” Watson said.  
> …  
> Watson reportedly went on to suggest that people who live in northern > climates drink more alcohol to compensate for the unhappiness they > suffer because of sunlight deprivation. Then he delved into what he > presented as the bad news, good news aspects of being fat, the > students said. The bad news, said Watson, is that thin people are more > ambitious and therefore make better workers. On the other hand, fat > people may be more sexual, Watson told the assembly, because their > bloodstreams contain higher levels of leptin, one of the hormones > derived from pom-C. He used a slide of a Reubens painting to > illustrate the assertion.

In any case, if you want to know more about Brenner’s science, [In the Beginning Was the Worm](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231131461/geneexpressio-20) is a good overview with biographical detail.
