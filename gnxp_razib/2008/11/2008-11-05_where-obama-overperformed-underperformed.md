Where Obama overperformed & underperformed

The [MSM rocks](http://nytimes.com/), specifically the [New York Times](http://nytimes.com/).  
![theshift2008.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/theshift2008.jpg?resize=400%2C227)![theshift2008.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/theshift2008.jpg?resize=400%2C227)If you filtered out blacks I’m pretty sure that the swath of red would be far more discernible in the South.\* The blue patches match up very well with the [Black Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_Region). It looks like the [East South Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_South_Central_States) Census division, the core of [Old Dixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie) is for now the Other America, along with parts of Appalachia.  
I spot checked [2004 exits](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5297118/) and compared them to [this year](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls.main/). Whites in the deep South seem to have shifted Republican against the national trend. We’re back to old school [sectionalism](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/E/1850s/poli1.htm), but now blacks can vote. People have said that the [white vote](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/the_rise_of_the_non_whites.php) barely budged; I don’t think that’s true, **Southern and non-Southern whites shifted in different directions and balanced out.** That’s not a trivial detail.
