Exit polls

Please read this [post](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/looking_for_presidential_exit.php) from Mark Blumenthal on the purpose and uses of exit polls. I’ll probably starting digging through them and start posting facts and charts late tonight trying to smoke out interesting regional and social dynamics. You can [check the exit polls](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls.main/) yourself; don’t take someone’s word when they assert something, **check it yourself, pundits lie or are misinformed a great deal of the time**. I learned that from listening to election “coverage” during the primaries on the radio, I can’t imagine what TV must be like….
