CNTNAP2 & language

[Anthropology.net](http://anthropology.net/2008/11/06/cntnap2-variant-linked-to-language-impairment/) &
[prefonal](https://biomarker-driven-mental-health-2.blogspot.com/2008/11/sintinap-is-nonword-that-makes-it-hard.html) both have posts up which survey a new paper, [A Functional Genetic Link between Distinct Developmental Language Disorders](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa0802828):

> We found that FOXP2 binds to and dramatically down-regulates CNTNAP2, > a gene that encodes a neurexin and is expressed in the developing > human cortex. On analyzing CNTNAP2 polymorphisms in children with > typical specific language impairment, we detected significant > quantitative associations with nonsense-word repetition, a heritable > behavioral marker of this disorder (peak association, P=5.0Ã—10-5 at > SNP rs17236239). Intriguingly, this region coincides with one > associated with language delays in children with autism.
