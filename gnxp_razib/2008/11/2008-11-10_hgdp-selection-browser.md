HGDP Selection Browser

You know what the Human Genome Diversity Project ([HGDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HGDP)) is implicitly, they’re the [list of populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HGDP#Current_status) you’ve seen in many human genetics papers already. Now the Pritchard lab has put up a [nice browser](http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/HGDP/) to query the data in a manner analogous to [Haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm). One of the major improvements, aside from the fact that you’re looking at 52 populations instead of 3, is that it uses GET to pass parameters instead of POST. That means I can link to the queries for [KITLG](http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/HGDP/?name=KITLG) and [SLC24A5](http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/HGDP/?name=SLC24A5). Try it, it works! Under instructions it is laconically stated that:

> Search using a sequence name, gene name, locus, or other landmark. The > wildcard character \* is allowed. To center on a location, click the > ruler. Use the Scroll/Zoom buttons to change magnification and > position.

  
Great! But [Dan MacArthur](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/diy_searching_for_evolutions_signa.php) has a [massive post](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/diy_searching_for_evolutions_signa.php), [Do It Yourself: searching for evolution’s signature in 53 human populations](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/diy_searching_for_evolutions_signa.php) which drags you up the learning curve:

Read [the whole thing](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/diy_searching_for_evolutions_signa.php). Really. Link the [whole thing](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/diy_searching_for_evolutions_signa.php). Really.  
**Caveat:** 650,000 SNPs from 968 individuals in over 50 populations is great, but obviously we’ll know more when we fill in the “blank spots” on the HGDP map and increase the density.
