Evolution of Primate Regulation

[Gene Regulation in Primates Evolves under Tissue-Specific Selection Pressures](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000271):

> Regulatory changes have long been hypothesized to play an important > role in primate evolution. To identify adaptive regulatory changes in > humans, we performed a genome-wide survey for genes in which > regulation has likely evolved under natural selection. To do so, we > used a multi-species microarray to measure gene expression levels in > livers, kidneys, and hearts from six humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus > macaques. This comparative gene expression data allowed us to identify > a large number of genes, as well as specific pathways, whose > inter-species expression profiles are consistent with the action of > stabilizing or directional selection on gene regulation. Among the > latter set, we found an enrichment of genes involved in metabolic > pathways, consistent with the hypothesis that shifts in diet underlie > many regulatory adaptations in humans. In addition, we found evidence > for tissue-specific selection pressures, as well as lower rates of > protein evolution for genes in which regulation evolves under natural > selection. **These observations are consistent with the notion that > adaptive circumscribed changes in gene regulation have fewer > deleterious pleiotropic effects compared with changes at the protein > sequence level.**

Just like with recent human evolution, food matters:

> As can be seen, this network is enriched with transcription factors > and genes with metabolic functions. The phenotypes that may be > affected by the regulatory perturbation of this network include > carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and calcium signaling. > Indeed, selection on metabolic related pathways, and in particular on > calcium signaling, is particularly intriguing given the marked shift > in diet that occurred during human evolution.

Also, this hint of particular evolutionary dynamics is intriguing:

> Third, we found evidence for a correlation between both stabilizing > and directional selection on gene regulation and evolutionary > constraint at the protein sequence level (note that this result is > inconsistent with our previous observation, which was based on a much > smaller number of genes \[11\]). This observation suggests that > adaptation at the regulatory level occurs disproportionably in genes > that are widely constrained at the protein sequence level. In other > words, our results support the hypothesis that adaptation through > changes in evolutionary constrained genes can occur by altering their > regulatory patterns.
