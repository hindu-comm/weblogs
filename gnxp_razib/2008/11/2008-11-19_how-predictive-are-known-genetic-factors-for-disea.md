How predictive are known genetic factors for disease risk?

[Two](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/21/2208) [studies](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/359/21/2220?query=TOC) published today demonstrate what was immediately evident from genome-wide association studies of many common diseases: the genetic variants identified account for only a small fraction of risk.

In these cases, the authors try to predict whether an individual will get type II diabetes from a number of clinical variables, as well as recently identified genetic risk factors. The genetic factors only marginally improve the prediction of diabetes, likely to a clinically insignificant extent.

This was obvious, of course, from the initial studies themselves–you can’t expect variants responsible for a meager fraction of overall disease risk to function as effective predictors of the disease. But somewhat notable nonetheless.
