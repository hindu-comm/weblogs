EDAR & East Asian hair form

I’ve mentioned [EDAR](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=EDAR+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) before. If you’ve ever wondered why East Asians tend to have rather thick hair, it is likely due to genetic variation at this locus, in particular the SNP [rs3827760](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=3827760). Yann [reminded me](https://yannklimentidis.blogspot.com/2008/11/another-edar-hair-thickness-association.html) that a new paper has come out which replicates and clarifies some earlier findings, [A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia](http://www.springerlink.com/content/u5t2272077811l01/). Below the fold is an important figure from the paper.

The concluding paragraph of the paper does the standard cryptic pointing to future possible avenues of exploration:

> Although 1540T/C is the major genetic contributor to hair fiber > thickness variation in Asian populations, the possible impact of EDAR > on other human phenotypes still remains to be elucidated. > Interestingly, recent evolutionary studies reported EDA, which encodes > the ligand of EDAR, to be clearly related to the body armor plate > morphology of stickleback (Colosimo et al. 2005) and that the > evolutionary pattern of the EDA-pathway corresponds to the > morphological diversification of vertebrate skin appendages > (Pantalacci et al. 2008). Moreover, EDAR is a promising candidate as a > genetic determinant of human tooth and/or gland variations > (Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus 2005). Therefore, EDAR could prove to be a > key locus that has led to a number of morphological changes in Asians.

Remember that this may be a [recent derived trait](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=recent+human+evolution+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) in East Asians which was driven by positive selection. In fact, that’s the assumption in this paper.
