Democrats doing better in richer regions?

Earlier this week Andrew Gelman [suggested](http://redbluerichpoor.com/blog/?p=206) that it looks like Barack Obama’s election had less to do with “realignment” then an overall tilt in the electorate, which just managed to “tip” a few borderline states. This is rather clear when you look at [maps of the results](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/the_more_things_change.php) from 2004 to 2008. But today Gelman reports data which suggests that [the gains in 2008](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/11/vote_swings_in_2.html) were disproportionately in wealthier regions. This makes sense when you inspect the McCain Belt, those counties where Republicans actually did better in 2008 than they did in 2004.
