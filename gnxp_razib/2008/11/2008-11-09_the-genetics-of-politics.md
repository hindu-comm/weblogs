The genetics of politics

[Political Behavior through the Lens of Behavior Genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/political-behavior-through-lens-of.php):

I anticipate that Fowler and his > partners in crime will continue to leave a trail of evidence from > which we can build an even stronger case for a political science which > does not make assumptions that are at odds with stylized facts from > behavior genetics.

Read the [whole thing](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/political-behavior-through-lens-of.php), as the links are worth checking out. I’ve addressed how we can and should interpret the heritability of political orientation [before](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004096.html); suffice it to say that the key is to remember what [heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability) really means, as opposed to transforming the descriptions of mapping from genotype to phenotype into coarse cut-outs.
