An Age Problem, or a God Problem?

I noticed today that [Heather Mac Donald](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/10-questions-for-heather-mac-donald.php) has [just engaged in another](http://blog.beliefnet.com/blogalogue/to-believe-in-god-or-not/) dialog with Michael Novak about God over at [Beliefnet](http://blog.beliefnet.com/blogalogue/to-believe-in-god-or-not/). As an unabashed vocal unbeliever Heather is exceptional on the American Right (compare to George F. Willâ€™s [relative diffidence](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/171135/june-03-2008/george-will) about his agnosticism). Simultaneously, there has been some concern that the youth vote swung so decisively toward the Democrats [this election](http://www.thenextright.com/jon-henke/expanding-the-youth-vote-myth-or-reality). Since it is also known that the young people are more secular than past generations, I wonder if some of the shift might not simply be due to the stronger association between American conservatism and a specific religious tradition (conservative Protestantism). Below the fold are tables which I generated using the [GSS](sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss06). I combined ages and political ideologies to simplify the categories (e.g., adding extremely and slightly liberal together with liberal into one category). Also, I filtered the sample so that all respondents were white.

[TABLE]

I am struck by the decline in self-identified conservatives who are not 100% sure that God exists. Below is a chart showing the change in the proportion of more secular sectors. I simply added all the categories except for the two most religious ones.
