IE CSS issue

Some people have pointed out a major problem with the rendering of this website on IE. I think I fixed the stylesheet issue. Since the site was fine in IE until recently Iâ€™m pretty sure it was a Microsoft update of some sort. If you notice anything similar with IE, just email me. I only use IE for Netflix. This only applies to IE 7.
