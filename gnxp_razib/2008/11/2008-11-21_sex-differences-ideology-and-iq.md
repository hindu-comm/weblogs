Sex differences, ideology and IQ

[The Audacious Epigone](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/) has two interesting posts up right now. [Conservative men more intelligent than conservative women; Liberal women more intelligent than liberal men](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/11/conservative-men-more-intelligent-than.html) and [Politics and IQ; Conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans least intelligent](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/11/politics-and-iq-conservative-democrats.html). The titles are self-evident, but, I would add that with hindsight it might make sense that liberal Republicans aren’t too bright. If you’re a liberal Republican you are probably just in denial, or, confused and dull. When I think liberal Republican I think [Tom Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Campbell_(California_politician)) or [Chris Shays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Shays), but these may simply be elite examples who don’t reflect the fact that most ideological outliers in parties are just individuals who don’t think deeply. For example, someone who was born into a “Republican family,” and doesn’t reflect much about ideology and so continues to vote Republican despite being liberal. I don’t feel I need to explain conservative Democrats, as it seems to me that political exemplars of this class are generally duller than liberal or moderate Democrats.

**Note:** I know this is kind of a political post, but I’m going to be strict about not letting the comment thread degenerate immediately. So don’t get offended if I don’t let you through the mod-queue even if I normally do.
