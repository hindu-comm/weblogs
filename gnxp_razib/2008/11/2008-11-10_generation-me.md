Generation Me?

In a [recent post](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2008/11/availability-bias-in-judging-young.html), Agnostic dismissed Jean Twenge’s thesis that narcissism has increased over the last couple of decades. Twenge has been on my reading list for a while, so this intrigued me. Not feeling knowledgeable enough to play devil’s advocate against agnostic, I sent Professor Twenge an email inviting her to join [the thread](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2008/11/availability-bias-in-judging-young.html#c5146140695605277992). She does a pretty good job of [defending her thesis](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2008/11/availability-bias-in-judging-young.html#c3830936669515463353) against agnostic’s criticisms, in my opinion. I invite anyone who’s interested [to check out the thread](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2008/11/availability-bias-in-judging-young.html#c5146140695605277992), read the studies, and share their own two cents.
