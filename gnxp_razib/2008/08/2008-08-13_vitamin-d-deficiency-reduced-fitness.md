Vitamin D deficiency → reduced fitness?

[25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels and the Risk of Mortality in the General Population](http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/168/15/1629):

> In cross-sectional multivariate analyses, increasing age, female sex, > nonwhite race/ethnicity, diabetes, current smoking, and higher body > mass index were all independently associated with higher odds of > 25(OH)D deficiency…while greater physical activity, vitamin D > supplementation, and nonwinter season were inversely associated. > During a median 8.7 years of follow-up, there were 1806 deaths, > including 777 from CVD. In multivariate models (adjusted for baseline > demographics, season, and traditional and novel CVD risk factors), > compared with the highest quartile, being in the lowest quartile…was > associated with a 26% increased rate of all-cause mortality…and a > population attributable risk of 3.1%. The adjusted models of CVD and > cancer mortality revealed a higher risk, which was not statistically > significant….

*ScienceDaily*, [Low Vitamin D Levels Pose Large Threat To Health; Overall 26 Percent Increased Risk Of Death](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080811195629.htm). Death due to ateriosclerosis probably isn’t the strongest evolutionary force; most people who die of heart disease are past reproductive peak. But, it is noted in this, and other, research that Vitamin D levels seem to have a global influence on fitness, probably mediated through immune robusticity.
