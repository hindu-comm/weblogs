Two posts on history and dynamics

At my other weblog, [Cliodynamics, the rise & fall of empires and asabiya](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/cliodynamics-rise-fall-of-empires-and.php) and [Historical Dynamics and contingent conditions of religion](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/historical-dynamics-and-contingent.php). The first is a bit long. The second is rather long. My Voice will not be Silenced!
