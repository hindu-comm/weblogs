Richard Dawkins – Islamophobe?

> “Most devout Muslims are creationists so when you go to schools, there > are a large number of children of Islamic parents who trot out what > they have been taught,” Prof Dawkins said in a Sunday newspaper > interview.  
> “Teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that > children have been brought up with.

Fact: a greater proportion of Turks are Creationist than are Americans. Remember that Turkey is a secular and liberal Muslim country; one can project what the attitudes in other Muslim nations might be….  
[Fact](http://www.hcdi.net/polls/J5776/), here are the proportions of American medical doctors by religion (or lack of) who find Intelligible Design plausible:  
All – 18%  
Jewish – 3%  
Protestant – 35%  
Catholic – 11%  
Orthodox Christian – 37%  
Hindu – 11%  
Buddhist – 0%  
**Muslim – 43%**  
Atheist – 0%  
Spiritual – 4%  
Other – 29%

Fact: **Richard Dawkins will have to accept that multiculturalism entails respect of Difference and the Different Ways of Knowing of the Other.** The Enlightenment Project (EP) which marries scientism with atheism is not cultural-fair; rather, it serves as an appropriate corrective to the over-rationalism of *Western* Roman Catholic Christianity. On the other hand, the EP is not an appropriate lens to apply to a non-Western culture, which has developed along its own **evolutionary** path which brings it to a different set of values. An alternative tint to the mirror through which humanity views the world darkly if you will. Whatever corrective there may be to non-Western dogma and rigidity, the assertions of Dead White Men and their contemporary Amen Choir are not appropriate cures!  
[Charles Darwin](http://mek1980.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/nat_sci_image.jpg) was a White Man. [R. A. Fisher](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/digital/fisher/fisher2.jpg) was a White Man. [Ernst Mayr](http://www.zin.ru/Animalia/coleoptera/images/mayr_sciam.jpg) was a White Man. [T. H. Huxley](http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/soes/staff/tt/eh/pics/huxley.jpg) was a White Man. [Alfred Russel Wallace](http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/E603B/web06/Puja/Puja%27s%20Portfolio/ARW_files/image006.jpg) was a White Man. [W. D. Hamilton](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/images/hamilton.jpg) was a White Man. [Stephen Jay Gould](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Stephen_Jay_Gould_(by_Kathy_Chapman).jpg) was a White Man. Evolution is a tool of the White Man’s EP House; one can not transpose that tool into the context of the Other. In the Post-Colonial world we must reject Absolute and Objective Narratives of Scientific Hegemony which have been used to Oppress the Other. The wealth of Charles Darwin was gotten on the backs of men and women of Color.  
There are 1.5 billion Muslims. 5% of Europe’s population is now Muslim, and at current rates within 1-2 generations 25% of Europe’s population will be Muslim. Islam is the future. One can not reject the Ways of Knowing which emerge from analysis of the Eternal Koran. One can not bend before the Knowledge presented and offered by the White Man at the end of the cannon and bayonet. The Islamic religion tells us that the Koran was revealed by the angel Gabriel to Muhammad, and it is infallible. If the Koran is contradicted by the Science of Death White Men, **WHY SHOULD PEOPLE OF COLOR NOT STAND WITH THEIR *OWN* TRADITIONS.** Listen closely to Richard Dawkins, listen to the words he says, words of hegemony and domination, of exclusion and oppression, words uttered in the upper class British accents which have Silenced men and women of Color for generations.  
How is it that the Voice and Opinion of one White Man is worth more than the voice and opinion of 1.5 billion believers? Oppression. Racism. Otherism. Heteronormativity. Classism. Conservatism. Homophobia. Sexism. Genderism. Gendercide. Other. Of Color. Tradition. Culture. Heritage. Other Tradition. Dead. Colonialism. Post-Colonialism. Pre-Colonialism. Way of Knowing. Way. Otherization. Whiteness. Privilege. Your Privilege. Silence. You Silence Voice…..
