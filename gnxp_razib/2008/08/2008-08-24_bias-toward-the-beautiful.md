Bias toward the beautiful

One thing I have wondered about: why do people want to give people the benefit of the doubt in terms of looks if they get a “[Myspace angle](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=myspace%20angle)” photo or only hear someone’s voice? I have talked to many friends who are really biased in the direction of giving people the benefit of the doubt about the reality that there is a strong incentive to select the flattering picture (in large part because of retarded individuals such as my friends). So the individual is going to be less attractive than their photo on average even if it isn’t a totally blurry or tiny image. Additionally, in terms of pure perception I notice that when you see a very small thumbnail size photo there’s a tendency to perceive the person as more attractive than they are when you click the image and see them at a higher resolution. Finally, many people easily create a fantasy image of someone based on their voice.

So what’s up with this? Why aren’t we preprogrammed to be choosier and more jaded about these things? False negatives are less harmful than false positives? Why are guys still surprised when they meet their Myspace date who never posted a fully body shot and notice that the height to width ratio isn’t what they’d prefer? Is it the whole polygyny thing? Are women any different?
