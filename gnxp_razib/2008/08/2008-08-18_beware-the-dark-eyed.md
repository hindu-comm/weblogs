Beware the dark-eyed

[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/melanocortins-and-behavior.php) points me to a new paper in *Trends in Ecology*, [Pleiotropy in the melanocortin system, coloration and behavioural syndromes](http://www.science-direct.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VJ1-4T1BWKB-1&_user=10&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2008&_rdoc=11&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236081%232008%23999769990%23695972%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6081&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=13&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9e5a493946c680c2ec740f0cb194f1e0):

[Skin color](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=skin+color+evolution+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) seems to have gotten lighter over the past 5-20 thousand years across northern Eurasia by substitutions and changes in frequency on a few loci of large effect. Evolutionarily this predicts that pleiotropy will product side effect phenotypes before modifier genes can arise to mask the deleterious byproducts of said evolution.
