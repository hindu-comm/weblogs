Why are Finns anxious?

[An Association Analysis of Murine Anxiety Genes in Humans Implicates Novel Candidate Genes for Anxiety Disorders](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T4S-4T0X2R3-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4089d53e6324f5357d6f9d1de8483d92):

> Specific alleles and haplotypes of six of the examined genes revealed > some evidence for association (p ≤ .01). The most significant evidence > for association with different anxiety disorder subtypes were: p = > .0009 with ALAD (δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase) in social phobia, p = > .009 with DYNLL2 (dynein light chain 2) in generalized anxiety > disorder, and p = .004 with PSAP (prosaposin) in panic disorder.

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080827100818.htm):

> Furthermore, **the team’s international collaborators in Spain and the > United States are trying to replicate these findings** in their > anxiety disorder datasets to see whether the genes identified by > Finnish scientists predispose to anxiety disorders in other > populations as well. Only by replicating the results firm conclusions > can be drawn about the role of these genes in the predisposition to > anxiety in more general.

[Haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm) shows selection around ALAD for Africans. [PSAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosaposin) is interesting:

> This gene encodes a highly conserved glycoprotein which is a precursor > for 4 cleavage products: saposins A, B, C, and D. Each domain of the > precursor protein is approximately 80 amino acid residues long with > nearly identical placement of cysteine residues and glycosylation > sites. Saposins A-D localize primarily to the lysosomal compartment > where they facilitate the catabolism of glycosphingolipids with short > oligosaccharide groups. The precursor protein exists both as a > secretory protein and as an integral membrane protein and has > neurotrophic activities. Mutations in this gene have been associated > with **Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and metachromatic > leukodystrophy**….
