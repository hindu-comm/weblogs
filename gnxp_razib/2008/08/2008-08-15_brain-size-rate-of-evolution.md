Brain size ∝ rate of evolution?

[Brain Size and the Diversification of Body Size in Birds](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589461?cookieSet=1&journalCode=an):

Here is what [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814210006.htm) has:

My first thought on reading this paragraph was **“no shit.”** The idea that evolution is driven purely exogenous environmental parameters seems to be very common, and probably facilitated by the very term *natural* selection. But animals are part of nature too, our parasites are part of nature, etc. Selection happens, and there is intraspecific and interspecific competition as well as the fitness implications of environmental pressures.  
Last year when the story about accelerated human evolution broke I pointed out that the authors were focusing on one parameter, the population size, and how it impacted the number of positively selected new mutations. But for human beings population size is not the only parameter of note, **the fact that our cultures rapidly change and reshape the environment likely matters a great deal.** A few years ago [Bruce Lahn](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/10-questions-for-bruce-lahn_10.php) was mocked by some for suggesting that humans were on the verge of speciating before modern transportation increased the rate of gene flow. But the data from birds above suggests that Lahn’s logic was probably not faulty. We’re a big-brained beast which is always changing the selection parameters because of the protean nature of our culture.
