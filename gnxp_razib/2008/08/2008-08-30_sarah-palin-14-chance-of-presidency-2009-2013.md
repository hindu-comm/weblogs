Sarah Palin, 14% chance of Presidency 2009-2013?

Seems like thereâ€™s a [14% chance](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html) that if the Republicans keep the White House this year that Sarah Palin will be President of the United States in the interval 2009-2013. Of course, you could modulate the probability up or down based on plugging in more [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_McCain) into the model, but I think it gives a rough qualitative sense.
