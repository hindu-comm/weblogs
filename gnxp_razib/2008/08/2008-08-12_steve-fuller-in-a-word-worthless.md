Steve Fuller; in a word, worthless

Today I stumbled on to [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/12experts.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print) in *The New York Times*, [In U.S., Partisan Expert Witnesses Frustrate Many](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/12experts.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print), and thought of Steve Fuller; the sociologist of science who testified for the Creationists at the Dover trial. [John](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/) points me to this [awesome take-down](http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887) of Fuller’s book, [Science v. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Religion-Intelligent-Problem-Evolution/dp/0745641229/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218516490&sr=8-1). A nice sample:

> …Newton is supposed to have “presented his mathematical physics as the > divine plan that was implicitly written into the Bible \[emphasis > added\]” (p. 54). Fuller must have access to an otherwise unknown > veridical edition of the Principia. In the early nineteenth century, > Cuvier and Agassiz were supposed to have been thinking of climate > change (p. 59). Around the same time, Lamarck is supposed to have held > that “lower organisms literally strove to become higher organisms, > specifically humans, who at some point in the future would be Earth’s > sole denizens” (p. 146), a view to be found nowhere in the Lamarckian > corpus.  
> The “Darwinian doctrine” is supposed to consist of the belief that > “chance mutations are the driving force of evolution” (p. 31). One > wonders what happened to natural selection. Fuller has an answer: > “compounded historical accidents” are also known as “natural > selection” (p. 48). This issue is particularly troubling because what > separates the neutral model of evolution from the selectionist or > “Darwinian” model of evolution is the question whether chance > mutations drive evolution: the neutralists claim they do whereas the > selectionists argue for the primacy of natural selection. For some > mysterious reason, Fuller has reversed the selectionists’ position.  
> Returning to Fuller’s book, Mendel is supposed to have had his work > rejected by scientific experts before he published it in a local > journal in Brünn (p. 61), a rejection of which no other historian is > aware. Pearson and Galton’s biometry is supposed to have been based on > a “blending theory of inheritance” (p. 145) even though Pearson > explicitly denied assuming any theory at all and Galton reported > experiments to refute the blending theory. William Jennings Bryan is > supposed to have been an “expert witness for the prosecution” (p. 115) > in the Scopes trial, rather than what he was: the prosecutor who > famously agreed to be an expert witness for the defense. Thanks to > molecular biology, genes are supposed to have been “\[broken\] down > into ordered strings of amino acids” (p. 135); one wonders what > happened to DNA nucleotide bases. All microevolution is supposed to > have been designed by humans (p. 141); presumably ancient humans were > privy to enough biological warfare techniques to design malaria and > cause the spread of the sickle cell allele in tropical and subtropical > populations.  
> The modern theory of evolution is often interpreted to be a synthesis > in the 1930s of Mendel’s theory of inheritance with Darwin’s theory of > natural selection (along with natural history). But, for Fuller, it > was a synthesis “between molecular genetics and natural history” and > it is supposed to have happened a decade before 1955 (p. 58) even > though there was no possibility of a molecular genetics before the > Watson-Crick double helix model of DNA which, incidentally, appeared > in 1953. (Elsewhere in the book he accepts the standard interpretation > of the synthesis \[e.g., p. 134\].) ….

Dude doesn’t know what he’s talking about…..
