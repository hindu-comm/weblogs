Small world

A few months ago I was talking to a friend who is pretty highly “connected,” insofar as he seems to know *everyone*. So we were talking about some genetics issues and I asked him, “You know who [Lee Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_M._Silver) is, right?” There was a pause, and my friend was like, “I just got off the phone with him.”
