Selection for height genes?

Three papers on genome wide association studies & height. [Identification of ten loci associated with height highlights new biological pathways in human growth](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.125.html), [Genome-wide association analysis identifies 20 loci that influence adult height](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.121.html) and [Many sequence variants affecting diversity of adult human height](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.122.html). [Dan MacArthur](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/04/height-and-hypertension-genes-in-nature.html) hits the major point:

> ScienceDaily puts a positive spin on the story (“[Scientists are > beginning to develop a clearer picture of what makes some people stand > head and shoulders above the > rest](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080406153335.htm)“), > but the real story is this: despite the massive scale of these > studies, they’re still only capturing less than 5% of the total > variance in a trait that is almost entirely (90%) genetic.

I was wondering if there was any recent selection in the genomic regions pinpointed in the three papers, so I turned to [Haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm). Below the fold are the results….

  
I set Haplotter so that it looked around a 1 MB window fixed on the gene I queried. X = a hit within that window, while XX = a hit on that specific gene. The columns are pretty self-explanatory, but do note some of these genes are very close to each other. Also, I had to use aliases, and I can’t guarantee that a gene isn’t listed twice because of the usage of aliases. All in all, note much selection, huh? I wasn’t expecting much, but nice to confirm expectations….
