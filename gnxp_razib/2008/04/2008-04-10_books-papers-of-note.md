Books & papers of note

This is an open thread where you can post links or pointers to books & papers you think might be interesting to those who read this weblog in [comments](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/8825073883780087137?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/books-papers-of-note.php&thetime=4/10/2008%2011:05:00%20AM). I generally get a lot of good pointers via comments, but if this works out I’ll just post this every month or so. I’ll leave the scope of the request to your discretion, though if you are a regular reader you know the purview of this weblog.
