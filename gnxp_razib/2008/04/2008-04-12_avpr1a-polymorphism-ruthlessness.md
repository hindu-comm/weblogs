AVPR1a polymorphism & “ruthlessness”

![Genghis_Khan.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Genghis_Khan.jpg?resize=150%2C222)![Genghis_Khan.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Genghis_Khan.jpg?resize=150%2C222)A few months ago I blogged a paper, [Individual differences in allocation of funds in the dictator game associated with length of the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor RS3 promoter region and correlation between RS3 length and hippocampal mRNA](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1601-183X.2007.00341.x). Now these results have hit the press with [really wack](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080404/full/news.2008.738.html) titles. Jake at [Pure Pedantry](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/04/the_ruthlessness_gene.php) and Joseph at [Corpus Callosum](http://scienceblogs.com/corpuscallosum/2008/04/ruthlessness_gene_discovered.php) offer the appropriate scientific caution. Caution is warranted, but I think the next decade at the intersection of [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_economics) & [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_genetics) is going to be **very big**. Papers such as [Heritability of ultimatum game responder behavior](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0706642104v1) & [Heritability of cooperative behavior in the trust game](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/10/3721) are just the tip of the iceberg.
