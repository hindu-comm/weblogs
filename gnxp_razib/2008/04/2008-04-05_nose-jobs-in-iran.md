Nose jobs in Iran

![bahar.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/bahar.jpg?resize=179%2C160)![bahar.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/bahar.jpg?resize=179%2C160)A new [piece](http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=0fb53c5d-88bf-4866-a0eb-9fe175978bdc) in *TNR*, [Iranian Chic](http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=0fb53c5d-88bf-4866-a0eb-9fe175978bdc), highlights the fact that nose jobs are all the rage in the Islamic Republic. A [more detailed article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/07/lifeandhealth.iran) notes:

One of the main reasons offered for this fixation on facial perfection is that in Iran women can show their faces, but not their hair or figure (at least theoretically). So there is a natural tendency to fixate on the one region of the body which is a visible. Of course, that begs the question why nose jobs are popular with males in Iran as well. Additionally, I recently went to a [Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norouz) celebration with [Kambiz](http://anthropology.net), and the relatively liberal Iranian Americans unnecumbered by onerous morals legislation (head-scarf to cleavage ratio was 1:50) were obviously in love with plastic surgery too as evidenced by the presence of [Latoya-Jackson-Face](http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r223/gldy08/latoya.jpg).  
Below the fold a video report on the trend.
