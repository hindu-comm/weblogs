Asterix the drunk?

A few weeks ago [I mentioned](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/prehistoric-origins-of-european.php) that I was going to read [The Prehistoric Origins of European Economic Integration](http://www.mcgill.ca/files/economics/theprehistoricorigins.pdf) and throw up a post on the topic. I’ve read it, but I don’t have anything intelligent to say on it right now. Unfortunately, when it comes to economic history I’m at the [left edge of the knowledge curve](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/facts-matter.php), and my inferential engine really isn’t post-worthy most of the time. When something intelligent pops into mind I’ll post it, but until then I thought this portion of the paper was interesting from a GNXP perspective:

Alcohol consumption in the European > interior goes back to the third millennium, and was evidently a > central element in early ritual. Until northern Europeans learned how > to malt grain to brewing beer, however, alcohol could only be obtained > by fermenting fruit and honey, which made it costly and rare. The > arrival of a beverage having an alcoholic content upwards of ten > percent worked a revolution in trans-Alpine Europe. Writing when the > trade was in full swing immediately after the Roman conquest Diodorus > observed that >

Consequently, many of > > the Italian traders, induced by the love of money that characterizes > > them, believe that the love of wine of these Gauls is their own > > Godsend,’ >
> Caesar reports that the Nerviens and the Suevians refused entry to > wine traders for fear the drink would weaken their warriors.
