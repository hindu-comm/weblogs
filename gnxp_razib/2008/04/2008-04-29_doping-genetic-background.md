Doping & genetic background?

[Some Athletes’ Genes Help Outwit Doping Test](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/sports/30doping.html?hp) :

> The 55 men in a drug doping study in Sweden were normal and healthy. > And all agreed, for the sake of science, to be injected with > testosterone and then undergo the standard urine test to screen for > doping with the hormone. >
> The results were unambiguous: the test worked for most of the men, > showing that they had taken the drug. But 17 of the men tested > negative. Their urine seemed fine, with no excess testosterone even > though the men clearly had taken the drug. >
> It was, researchers say, a striking demonstration of a genetic > discovery.

The whole “Asian” angle wouldn’t be as important from where I stand if China wasn’t intent on becoming an athletic superpower. Specifically, from [Doping Test Results Dependent on Genotype of UGT2B17, the Major Enzyme for Testosterone Glucuronidation](http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/jc.2008-0218v1):

> We demonstrated that a deletion polymorphism in the gene coding for > UGT2B17…is strongly associated with TG levels in urine…All subjects > devoid of the gene had a T/E ratio below 0.4…This polymorphism was > considerably more common in a Korean Asian than in a Swedish Caucasian > population, with 66.7 and 9.3 % deletion/deletion (del/del) > homozygotes respectively.

They don’t seem to know what SNP is causing this. If you are curious, you can check out the linkage disequilibrium around [*UGT2B17*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/GeneGt.cgi?geneID=7367).
