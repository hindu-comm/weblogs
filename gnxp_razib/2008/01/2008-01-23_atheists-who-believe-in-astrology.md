Atheists who believe in astrology

The always interesting [Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/01/do-atheists-believe-in-anything-over-at.html) has a post up where he cranks through the GSS to figure out how belief that astrology is somewhat or very scientific relates to belief in God. Below the fold I’ve taken his results and turned it into a chart.

Note that the frequency who accept astrology increases, but note the bump for those who accept the appellation atheist! There are two primary points. First, **atheism does not entail scientific materialism.** Sometimes we need to reiterate this. Second, there might be issues with who accepts the self-definition of atheist vs. agnostic. In my experience many agnostics are operational atheists who find the term atheism too harsh, or associate it with negative traits.
