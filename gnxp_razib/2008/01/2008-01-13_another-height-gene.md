Another height gene

Following [on the heels of HMGA2](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/09/why_you_be_short_or_tall_well.php), [another genome-wide scan](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.74.html) for genes involved in height identfies a region near GDF5 and UQCC:

> Identifying genetic variants that influence human height will advance > our understanding of skeletal growth and development. Several rare > genetic variants have been convincingly and reproducibly associated > with height in mendelian syndromes, and common variants in the > transcription factor gene HMGA2 are associated with variation in > height in the general population1. Here we report genome-wide > association analyses, using genotyped and imputed markers, of 6,669 > individuals from Finland and Sardinia, and follow-up analyses in an > additional 28,801 individuals. We show that common variants in the > osteoarthritis-associated locus2GDF5-UQCC contribute to variation in > height with an estimated additive effect of 0.44 cm (overall P \< > 10-15). Our results indicate that there may be a link between the > genetic basis of height and osteoarthritis, potentially mediated > through alterations in bone growth and development

It’s worth noting that the loci currently identified as being “height genes” contribute less than 1% of the total variance in height in the population, while the total heritability of height is around 80% in developed countries.
