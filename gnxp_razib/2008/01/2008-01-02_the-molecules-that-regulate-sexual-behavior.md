The molecules that regulate sexual behavior

Now, I’m no [expert on *Drosophila* sex](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/), but [this paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7174/full/nature06483.html) caught my eye:

> Mating in many species induces a dramatic switch in female > reproductive behaviour. In most insects, this switch is triggered by > factors present in the male’s seminal fluid. How these factors exert > such profound effects in females is unknown. Here we identify a > receptor for the Drosophila melanogaster sex peptide (SP, also known > as Acp70A), the primary trigger of post-mating responses in this > species. Females that lack the sex peptide receptor (SPR, also known > as CG16752), either entirely or only in the nervous system, fail to > respond to SP and continue to show virgin behaviours even after > mating. SPR is expressed in the female’s reproductive tract and > central nervous system. The behavioural functions of SPR map to the > subset of neurons that also express the fruitless gene, a key > determinant of sex-specific reproductive behaviour.

In light of [previous discussions](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/hypotheses-are-overrated.php) on the relationship between genetic screens and “big biology”, it’s notable that this gene was identified in a genome-wide screen for genes involved in female post-reproductive behavior by RNAi knockdown–one of the newer tools in the modern geneticist’s toolkit.
