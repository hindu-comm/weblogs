Recombination week at Science

It’s like [shark week](http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/sharkweek/splash.html), only better! Whet your appetite with “[High-Resolution Mapping of Crossovers Reveals Extensive Variation in Fine-Scale Recombination Patterns Among Humans](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151851)“, then top it off with “[Sequence Variants in the RNF212 Gene Associate with Genomewide Recombination Rate](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152422)“. Enjoy!
