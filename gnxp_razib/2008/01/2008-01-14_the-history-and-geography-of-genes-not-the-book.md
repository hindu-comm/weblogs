The History and Geography of Genes…not the book

I know that there are many readers of this weblog who are interested in both history and genetics. I assume that those who share these interests with me were very excited by the publication of [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20) 15 years ago. L. L. Cavalli-Sforza’s magnum opus ushered in a new era in the synthesis between the historical sciences & genetic methodologies. Much of it is sloppy; some of it is very insightful and sheds new light upon old questions. At my other blog I’ve been posting on this topic, and another ScienceBlogger, an archaeologist by training, has responded with a critique. My original posts, [From where came the Slavs?](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/from_where_came_the_slavs.php) & [Overturning assumptions: why genes matter in history](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/historical_assumptions.php), Martin’s response, [Genes and Peoples](http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/01/genes_and_peoples.php), and my rebuttal, [Categories are instruments; Slavs are tools](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/categories_are_instruments.php) (no offense about the title Steve C.!). If you comment on Martin’s post, be nice, we disagree but he’s a cool guy.
