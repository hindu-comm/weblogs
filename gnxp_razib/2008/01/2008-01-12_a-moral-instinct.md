A moral instinct?

Steven Pinker has a new essay in *The New York Times Magazine*, [The Moral Instinct](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?pagewanted=all). Chris of [Mixing Memory](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/) is critical of Pinker when he goes outside of his specialization in the psychology of language…but I did enjoy the ending:

> Far from debunking morality, then, the science of the moral sense can > advance it, by allowing us to see through the illusions that evolution > and culture have saddled us with and to focus on goals we can share > and defend. As Anton Chekhov wrote, “Man will become better when you > show him what he is like.”

Knowledge is power.
