Britney vs. Christina, the later years….

![britchris.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/britchris.jpg?resize=300%2C600)![britchris.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/britchris.jpg?resize=300%2C600)Some of you may know that [Christina Aguilera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_aguilera) and music industry executive [Jordan Bratman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bratman) are now the parents of a son. In contrast, [Britney Spears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_spears) has two children by her ex-husband, [Kevin Federline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Federline). Years ago I used to prognosticate about the future of the young Ms. Aguilera and Spears; my own prediction was that Britney’s career and life track would be rockier and less intelligently decided than Christina’s. The main rationale I had at the time was that Christina has a greater quotient of native singing talent, while Britney relied on less durable strengths, so to speak.  
I think my general assessment is looking good at this point. Compare their choice of husbands. Jordan Bratman may not be a handsome man, but he is responsible, competent and complements his wife’s career track. It seems likely that his career was aided by nepotistic connections, so Aguilera integrated herself into a broader network with a great deal of social capital. In contrast, Spears hooked up with her back up dancer, a man who already had two children from a previous relationship and evinced no great talent in his own pursuits. Kevin Federline as a public personality was a creation of Britney Spears, and though her own travails have left him to be the last man standing when it comes to responsible parenting I don’t think that this leopard can truly change his spots. Though I can’t attest to Federline’s skillz, I think one could suppose he is by inclination more of a classic player than Jordan Bratman. What you see in the lives of these celebrities are the alternative strategies which we humans employ to obtain our life’s “satisfaction.”
