Getting a fix on gene expression

A few weeks ago [Kambiz of Anthropology.net](http://anthropology.net/) was mentioning how there’s very little mention of gene expression on this weblog. Fair enough, but hey, what [about this](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/01/genomic-noise-and-individual-variation.php)? And this paper just popped into my RSS today, so check it out, [Differential Allelic Expression in the Human Genome: A Robust Approach to Identify Genetic and Epigenetic Cis-Acting Mechanisms Regulating Gene Expression](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000006.eor):

This is a provisional paper, so one assumes there will be some revisions. In any case, cancer is important & all, but this is the kind of stuff I’m interested in (see Discussion):

Related: Kambiz has a post up on this with a lot more commentary, [Identifying Cis-Acting Elements that regulate Human Gene Expression](http://anthropology.net/2008/01/28/identifying-cis-acting-elements-that-regulate-human-gene-expression/). Also, in Nature, [Genome-wide analysis of transcript isoform variation in humans](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2007.57.html).
