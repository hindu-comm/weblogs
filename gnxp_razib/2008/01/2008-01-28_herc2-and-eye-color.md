HERC2 and eye color

There are two new papers out in *AJHG* about eye color variation and genomics. [Three Genome-wide Association Studies and a Linkage Analysis Identify HERC2 as a Human Iris Color Gene](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2808%2900074-8) and [A Single SNP in an Evolutionary Conserved Region within Intron 86 of the HERC2 Gene Determines Human Blue-Brown Eye Color](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2807%2900040-7). The second paper is an extension of the work of the Australian group which has been elucidating pigmentation relationships around [*OCA2*](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/oca2-blue-eyes-and-skin-color.php) for several years now. The first paper is more interesting (to my mind) because it’s the first [genome-wide association](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/linkage-versus-association-mini-primer.php) study to focus on this region. I’ve extracted figure 6a out of the paper, you might recognize the map. I’m not surprised; go to [Haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm) and enter in [HERC2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=8924&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Gene.Gene_ResultsPanel.Gene_RVDocSum), it pops out as a region of selection near OCA2 (I first noticed it when checking for OCA2). As for the map, pretty cool huh? As the authors note there’s a pretty good correlation between the frequency of the trait and the SNP of interest. The authors point to the north-south cline, but I am curious about the east-west one. Additionally, look at Bulgaria. I’ve been looking at Slavicization of the Balkans, and this is an interesting data point….

Note: Please be careful about taking the phenotypic clines too literally, I am to understand that there was a little extrapolation going on here and there. And of course, standard caveats on representativeness of the samples from each region and all.
