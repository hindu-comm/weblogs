Iowa predictions vs. results

How did I do? First, I got the rank order pretty much down! The only mistake was swapping Richardson and Biden. Second, I didn’t know how the Iowa Democratic Caucus was set up…otherwise, I would have been retarded to not assume it would have taken a “Winner Take All” outcome due to the 15% threshold. Below the fold, with 100% and 96% of precincts for Dems and Repubs respectively. New Hampshire predictions forthcoming!
