Liberal Fascism

Austin Bramwell has a [very enjoyable review](http://amconmag.com/2008/2008_01_28/review.html) up of Jonah Goldberg’s [Liberal Fascism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385511841/geneexpressio-20) in the most recent issue of [The American Conservative](http://amconmag.com/2008/2008_01_28/review.html). I don’t plan on reading Goldberg’s book myself, but Bramwell is an intimidating combination of substance & style, and I’m always interested in what he has to say. I generally prefer literature to literary criticism, but in many cases reviews of non-ficition works are more insightful than the ostensible object of their critique. Though his lawyerly deconstruction is elegant as always, it is Bramwell’s clear mastery of the waters of intellectual history which makes him such an incisive critic.
