Gene expression differences between populations

[Evaluation of Genetic Variation Contributing to Differences in Gene Expression between Populations](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2808%2900136-5#sec3) (Open Access):

> Gene expression is a complex quantitative trait partially regulated by > genetic variation in DNA sequence. Population differences in gene > expression could contribute to some of the observed differences in > susceptibility to common diseases and response to drug treatments. We > characterized gene expression in the full set of HapMap lymphoblastoid > cell lines derived from individuals of European and African ancestry > for 9156 transcript clusters…Gene expression was found to differ > significantly between these samples for 383 transcript clusters. > Biological processes including ribosome biogenesis and antimicrobial > humoral response were found to be enriched in these differential > genes, suggesting their possible roles in contributing to the > population differences at a higher level than that of mRNA expression > and in response to environmental information. Genome-wide association > studies for local or distant genetic variants that correlate with the > differentially expressed genes enabled identification of significant > associations with one or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), > consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors and not simply > population identity or other characteristics (age of cell lines, > length of culture, etc.) contribute to differences in gene expression > in these samples. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the > genes differentially expressed between populations and the enriched > biological processes involved in these genes. We also provide an > evaluation of the contributions of genetic variation and nongenetic > factors to the population differences in gene expression.
