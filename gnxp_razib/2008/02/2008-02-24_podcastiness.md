Podcastiness

I’ve been going into podcast overload lately, mainly because of this [boing boing post](https://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/13/four-more-podcasts-i.html). Wanted to alert you all to the high quality and interesting sound engineering of [Radio Lab](http://www.radiolab.org/) if you didn’t know about it already. I’ve jammed the Memory, Placebo, and Stress episodes so far and was pleased overall with the level of informativeness, though I always prefer for brain regions to have names rather than descriptions. The Memory episode features Joe Ledoux and Karim Nader discussing the reconsolidation revival that occurred a few years ago.

In other news, [The Sound of Young America](http://www.maximumfun.org/) has cool guests and The Rub has been doing a [History of Hip Hop](http://brooklynradio.net/the-rub) series that is worth your time.
