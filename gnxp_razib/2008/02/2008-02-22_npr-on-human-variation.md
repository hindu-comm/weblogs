NPR on human variation

[An In-Depth Look at Genetic Variation](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19279830), covers [Worldwide Human Relationships Inferred from Genome-Wide Patterns of Variation](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/319/5866/1100) (about \~15 minutes long, interview with [Rick Myers](http://www-shgc.stanford.edu/myerslab/)). Also, Wired [blogs](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/studies-put-pop.html) the most recent spate of papers (and gets a sound-bite from Marcus Feldman)….

Update: Readers might appreciate this from the Science paper:

> However, the between-population variance is sufficient to reveal > consistent population structure because subtle but nonrandom > differences between populations accumulate over a large number of loci > and yield principal components that can account for a major portion of > the variation (21).

What’s reference “21”? A. W. Edwards, *Bioessays* 25, 798 (2003). [Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin’s Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewontin%27s_Fallacy). *Ding, dong*….
