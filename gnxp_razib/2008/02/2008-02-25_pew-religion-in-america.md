Pew Religion in America

Pew is out with a [new survey of religion in America](https://religions.pewforum.org/). I’ve only skimmed it so far, but it has lots of interesting stuff. Note for example that this survey suggests that are marginally more self-identified Buddhists in America than Muslims (this is probably a function of the fact that Buddhism, and generally Buddhist ideas and concepts, have a much wider appeal to white Americans than Islam, whose “product” is less strong differentiated from forms of Christianity).

Check the [methodology](https://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-appendix4.pdf).
