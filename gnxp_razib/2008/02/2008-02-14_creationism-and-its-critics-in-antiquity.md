Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity

[![creationism.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/creationism.jpg?resize=161%2C240)![creationism.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/creationism.jpg?resize=161%2C240)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520253647/geneexpressio-20)I stumbled upon [Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520253647/geneexpressio-20) at the bookstore. I don’t have time to read it right now, but I thought I’d point to it since I’m sure some readers would be interested. Accuse me of being excessively [Whiggish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history) if you must, but it just reiterates that Creationism doesn’t belong in a science class; the basic disputes are a rehash of philosophical & religious clashes which are timeless, or at least date from the rise of philosophy in the ancient world. Creationism is ahistorical; I believe it is rooted in psychological intuitions about ontology which rebel against systematic critiques which undermines naive perceptions of How the World Works.
