Interracial marriage and Asian Americans

As a follow up to Assman’s last [post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/02/arms-races-and-interracial-encounters.php) I was thinking I should [link to this article](http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml) from [Asian-Nation](http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml) which parses Census 2000 data on interracial marriage of various Asian American groups. Do read the article (caveats appropriate to identity politics organs), but I just took their data and placed it below the fold. Also, I modified it a little and added the ratios of men to women who marry whites by generation and immigration status. That is, the Census broke up individuals according to whether they were immigrants, or US-raised or born. There are some caveats with analyzing the data in that way; Asian Indians and Vietnamese have only 1 US-raised or born generation which is actually marrying right now. These groups are post-1965, in contrast to Japanese Americans, who are predominantly US-raised or born, with many 3rd, 4th and 5th generation individuals. With that stated, I was surprised at the relatively moderate sex ratios when you constrain marriages only to those where both partners are non-immigrants; i.e., pretty much acculturated as Americans. Arguably the most assimilated Asian American group on this list, the Japanese, have the second most balanced sex ratio, 0.829 between males and females in outmarriage to whites. Why the most second balanced? Asian Indians are tops in terms of balance. In fact, when you look at all marriages men outmarry somewhat more than women in this group. But Asian Indians are a bit different than the others on the list in a whole lot of ways. Look at the very low marriage rates to “Other Asians” for example. These might even include Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, etc., overstating intermarriage with the other groups on the list. The full table below the fold….
