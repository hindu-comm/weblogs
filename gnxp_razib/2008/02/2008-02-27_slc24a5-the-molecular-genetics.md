SLC24A5, the molecular genetics?

[How Skin Color Is Determined](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080222155212.htm):

> In 2005 researchers identified a gene called SLC24A5 as a key > determinant of skin color. Rebecca Ginger and colleagues now confirm > that the protein product of this gene (NCKX5) is an ion exchanger; it > exchanges sodium for calcium across a membrane, regulated by > potassium. But unlike other NCKX proteins, they found that NCKX5 is > not present on the cell surface, but internally in a compartment known > as the trans-Golgi network. This compartment is where new proteins and > vesicles are processed, modified and sorted. >
> When the researchers knocked out NCKX5 in melanocytes (the skin cells > that manufacture the melanin pigment), melanin production decreased > dramatically. They also demonstrated that changing the ancestral amino > acid (alanine) at position 111 to the European form associated with > lighter skintone (threonine) reduced NCKX5â€™s exchanger activity.
