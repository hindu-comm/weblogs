Deletions and autism

A [recent paper in NEJM](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/358/7/667?query=TOC) is worth a read; it suggests a deletion on chromosome 16 predisposes to autism. The phenotype appears to be highly variable, though:

> \[I\]n a study of the same population by investigators at deCODE > Genetics, this deletion was observed at a markedly increased rate in > subjects with a psychiatric or language disorder. This study showed > that the deletion was present in 1 of 648 patients with schizophrenia, > 1 of 420 patients with bipolar disorder, 1 of 203 patients with ADHD > (the father of a child with autism, as noted above), and 1 of 3000 > patients with panic disorder, anxiety, depression, or addiction. In > addition, 1 of 748 patients with dyslexia carried the deletion. > Overall, in the Icelandic samples, **the carrier frequency among > patients with autism was 1%; the frequency was approximately 0.1% > among patients with a psychiatric or language disorder and 0.01% in > the general population.**

All these disease phenotypes can probably be thought of as extremes of some distribution of an underlying trait; I wonder how much variation in the “normal” range can be explained by *de novo* or rare copy number variants like this one.
