Social Explorer gets religion

Via [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/archives/2008/02/data_on_religio.html), check out the [Social Explorer](http://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/home/home.aspx) [geographic interface](http://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/maps/map3.aspx?g=10,0) for distributions of religious denominations and all the major census data parameters. One gripe, I do notice that their [prices aren’t public](http://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/subscribe/home.aspx). I assume that this is because they negotiate different price points for different subscribers, so it must be really spendy to justify the time. Maybe I just have a messed up perception of the costs here, the time & effort it takes to program the application, and the hardware it takes to run it, but I think there are a lot of data nerds out there who would pony up a non-trivial fee for access to this sort of service. There are benefits to having a huge subscriber base….
