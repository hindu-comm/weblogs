Bloggingheads TV, someone I know….

My friend Reihan Salam, the svengali behind [The American Scene](http://theamericanscene.com/), is on [blogginghead.tv](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8469) talking about the primary races. Reihan often has a high signal to noise ratio in large part because of his low analysis to data ratio.¹ He’s chatting with Chris Hayes, who [wrote up](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070611/hayes) a really interesting piece on [heterodox economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics) in *The Nation* this spring. Check it out.
