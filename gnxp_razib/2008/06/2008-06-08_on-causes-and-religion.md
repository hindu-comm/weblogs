On causes and religion

A [long response](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/on-causes-and-religion.php) by me at [my other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/on-causes-and-religion.php) to Alan Jacob’s piece, [Too Much Faith in Faith](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121271181887250603.html). A sample:

> As they say, **[read the whole > thing](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121271181887250603.html).** > Alan, as a Christian, place particular focus on the [New > Atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism#The_New_Atheism) > who wish to leave at religion’s feet all evil done it in its name but > explain away as incidental all the good whose motivation was > putatively supernatural. But he does note there are those such as > Rodney Stark, an extremely pro-Christian sociologist, who would > ascribe to religion all the good in the world while staying relatively > silent on the evil enacted in the name of God (or, the usual special > pleading that “that’s not the *real* fill-in-the-blank-religion”). > Below are a few general responses I have to Alan’s piece.  
> 1) Religion means different things at different times and different > contexts, and it means a lot. That’s a mouthful, but what I mean by > this is that there is a lot of debate on what exactly religion entails > on the margins. There are particular core traits which people > recognize as religious, but the fact that almost every random > functionally unrecognizable material remain has been classified as a > “religious cult object” by archaeologists illustrates the catchall > nature of religion. Additionally, different religions have different > emphases; some are more focused on > “[orthopraxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopraxis),” and some > are more fixated on > “[orthodoxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodoxy).”
