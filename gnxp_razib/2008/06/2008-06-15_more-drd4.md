More DRD4

Since I’ve been posting on [DRD4 a bit](), a reader asked that I post this link: [A gene X gene interaction between DRD2 and DRD4 is associated with conduct disorder and antisocial behavior in males](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1913922). It’s Open Access, so you can read the whole thing. Also, you might be interested [p-ter’s critique](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/questioning-breastfeeding-iq-fads2.php) of the MAOA research program before you go whole-hog on a behavior genetic kick.
