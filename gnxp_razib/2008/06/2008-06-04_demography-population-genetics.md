Demography & population genetics

John Hawks has a [post](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/evolution/demography/voight-demographic-exponential-2008.html?seemore=y) up, [Handling exponential growth in demographic models](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/evolution/demography/voight-demographic-exponential-2008.html?seemore=y). You might like to read it in concert with [p-ter’s post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/modeling-human-demographic-history.php) [Modeling human demographic history](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/modeling-human-demographic-history.php). One question I have in regards to human evolutionary genetic history is this: **how typical are our population dynamics up to this point for a typical sexually reproducing species?** And therefore, how might that impact deviations for our species from the norm? Also, if you are interested in the intersection of evolutionary genetics and models of demography you can go back to R. A. Fisher’s [Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/), there’s a nice, if somewhat tedious, exposition of the relevance of the latter toward developing a good model of the former.
