Postgrad education vs. literalism: update

Last month my posts Biblical literalism or low IQ: which came first? and Educational levels & denomination got a lot of play around the blogosphere. I used the [US Religious Landscape Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/portraits) to get demographic data for denominations, but I had to cobble together numbers on Biblical literalism, etc. But with a further release of data I can now flesh out almost all the denominations plotting postgrad education % vs. belief that the Bible is the literal word of god.  
**Clarification:** Y axis = % with postgrad education. X axis = % who believe the Bible is the literal word of god.

As you can see, the trend still holds with more denominations. I decided to do this since people were curious about denomination X, and I didn’t have that included. Click the image or here for a larger version so you can see the labels. And here is a chart with all religious affiliations included (e.g., includes non-orthodox Christians such as Mormons as well as non-Christians). Below the fold I’ve put the raw data I used, but if you want to snatch it for yourself, here it is as a CSV file (if you do some statistical analysis of the data post a link in the comments and I’ll link next week).
