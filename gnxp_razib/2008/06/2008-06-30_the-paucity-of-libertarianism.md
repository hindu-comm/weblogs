The paucity of libertarianism

A few weeks ago I read [Brink Lindsey’s](http://www.brinklindsey.com/) [The Age of Abundance: How Prosperity Transformed America’s Politics and Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060747676/geneexpressio-20/). One strange thing is that because I’ve watched Brink on [BloggingHeads.TV](http://bloggingheads.tv/) on occasion could *hear* the prose with his particular cadence and delivery. Really weird. In any case, [The Age of Abundance](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060747676/geneexpressio-20/) is a social history of the 20th century which makes the case that despite the persistence of a partisan divide our culture has operationally congealed around a rough libertarian consensus. In short, a free market of money and lifestyle choices. I think there is a strong argument that can be made for this, as evidenced by Matt Yglesias’ [qualified admission](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/06/after_socialism.php) as to the rapprochement between the Left and the market, or the phenomenon of [South Park Conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park_Conservatives).

  
But despite what the folks over at CATO would prefer, the reality remains that libertarianism is a marginal phenomenon in terms of feet on the ground. It isn’t a mass movement. Libertarians are highly concentrated among young well educated secular males. People like [Will Wilkinson](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/). I was struck by this while reading a post by [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/06/ranking_states.html), [Ranking states by the liberalism/conservatism of their voters](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/06/ranking_states.html). There are several great charts in this post, but if you divide the ideological map into 4 quadrants, here are the numbers of states in each zone:  
**Liberal** = 15 (socially & economically liberal)  
**Conservative** = 21 (socially & economically conservative)  
**Authoritarian** = 7 (socially conservative & economically liberal)  
**Libertarian** = 4 (socially liberal & economically conservative)  
(Alaska and Hawaii not in the chart, and excluded North Carolina since it seemed to straddle)  
Gelman’s whole post is worth reading, [go check the figures out at his site](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/06/ranking_states.html). I will note that binning the states into the categories as I have *overstate* the representation of libertarianism; the libertarian states were marginal cases. The authoritarian quadrant has more extreme exemplars (West Virginia and Kentucky), while the liberal and conservative sectors exhibit a full distribution from leaners all the way to the very liberal and conservative.
