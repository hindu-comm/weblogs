Synthesis

About 5 years ago [William Gunn](http://synthesis.williamgunn.org/) was about to start blogging at Gene Expression; but life intervened and it never happened. Well, he’s started posting at his [own blog](http://synthesis.williamgunn.org/) regularly, [Synthesis](http://synthesis.williamgunn.org/), and I recommend it for anyone’s RSS feed (you already have it if you are subscribed to [The DNA Network](http://networks.feedburner.com/The-DNA-Network), a really great way to introduce yourself to the “genetic blogosphere”; boy have things changed since 2002!).
