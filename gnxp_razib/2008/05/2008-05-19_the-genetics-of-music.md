The genetics of music?

[Genes For Musical Aptitude In Finnish Families Located](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080519104624.htm):

> Researchers from Finland and USA have identified one major and several > potential loci associated with musical aptitude in the human genome. > The results raise an interesting question about common evolutionary > background of music and language faculties.

The paper is open access, [Genome wide linkage scan for loci of musical aptitude in Finnish families:Evidence for a major locus at 4q22](http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/jmg.2007.056366v1):

> The heritability estimates were 42% for KMT, 57% for SP, 21% for ST > and 48% for the combined music test scores. Significant evidence of > linkage was obtained on chromosome 4q22 > ([LOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage) 3.33) and > suggestive evidence of linkage at 8q13-21 (LOD 2.29) with the combined > music test scores using variance component (VC) linkage analyses. The > major contribution for the 4q22 locus was obtained with KMT (LOD > 2.91). Interestingly, a positive LOD score of 1.69 was shown at 18q, a > region previously linked to dyslexia (DYX6), using combined music test > scores.
