What are men good for?

I came across an interesting 2007 talk that social psychologist Roy Baumeister gave to the American Psychological Association, [“Is There Anything Good About Men?”](http://www.psy.fsu.edu/%7Ebaumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm) He informally reviews the literature on sex differences in ability and motivation. Some of it will be old news for readers, such as the discussion of Larry Summers, but there’s quite a lot that will not. Some interesting tidbits:

– Most people in the West now believe that women possess more desirable qualities than men do. (Agreed — I only interact with males as colleagues, keeping all of my friends female.)

– Women are more likely than men to commit violence against an intimate partner.

– About 80% of those who work 50-hour weeks are men.

– 93% of those killed on the job in the US are men.

– Men appear more oriented toward large-scale social groups where relationships are shallow but many, women toward small-scale groups where they are deep but few. Baumeister suggests that this is a key source of male-female inequality after the transition to agriculture: men were more suited to the large-scale networks that came to run social, political, and economic life.
