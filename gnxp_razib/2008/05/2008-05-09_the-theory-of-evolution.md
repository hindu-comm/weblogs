The theory of evolution

Over at [The Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/54632/) [Neil S. Greenspan](http://path-www.path.cwru.edu/information6.php?info_id=22) has an article up, [Darwin and deduction](http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/54632/):

> One of the most remarkable but insufficiently noted features of > Charles Darwin’s conception of evolution is that its logical > implications are still being worked out. I am not merely claiming that > experimental and observation studies continue to make use of and bear > on Darwinian ideas and principles. I am calling attention to the fact > that after almost a century and a half, **new deductions are still > being teased out of his very fertile axioms of descent with > modification and natural selection.**

One of the primary criterion which scientists use to judge the utility of a theory is its inferential power. It is one thing to describe; but another to predict. This is one reason I recommend all my friends to read [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/); R. A. Fisher’s attempt to create a mathematical framework in which to conceptualize the action of natural selection within evolutionary process. To a great extent I think Fisher fails in his grandest objectives, but fundamentally I think the exposition clarifies one’s thinking fruitfully.
