Notes on Sewall Wright: Wright’s F-statistics

[Notes on Sewall Wright: Wright’s F-statistics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/05/notes-on-sewall-wright-wrights-f.php):

> A preliminary question is one of terminology. What, if anything, does > the letter ‘F’ stand for? One plausible answer is that it stands for > ‘fixation’, since among other things the F-statistics can be used to > measure the rate at which alleles tend to be ‘fixed’. Wright himself > in his later writings sometimes refers to F as an ‘index of fixation’.

Believe it or not, F_(st) is one of thos population genetic concepts you’ve almost certainly encountered no matter your background.
