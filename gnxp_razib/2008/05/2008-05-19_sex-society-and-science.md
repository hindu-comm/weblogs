Sex, society and science

[Sheril](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2008/05/isef_2008_what_gender_disparit.php) and [other science bloggers](http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/2008/05/isef_2008_the_best_of_the_best_1.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=sublink) are talking about the fact that the top 3 in the *Intel International Science and Engineering Fair* are female. I suppose that means we’ll stop talking about gender disparities in science & engineering? Yeah, I doubt it….  
At the same time, this just popped into my RSS, [The freedom to say ‘no’: Why aren’t there more women in science and engineering? Controversial new research suggests: They just aren’t interested](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/05/18/the_freedom_to_say_no/?page=full):

> They have a provocative echo in the conclusions of Susan Pinker, a > psychologist and columnist for the Toronto Globe and Mail. In her > controversial new book, “The Sexual Paradox: Men, Women, and the Real > Gender Gap,” Pinker gathers data from the journal Science and a > variety of sources that show that in countries where women have the > most freedom to choose their careers, the gender divide is the most > pronounced.  
> The United States, Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and the United > Kingdom, which offer women the most financial stability and legal > protections in job choice, have the greatest gender split in careers. > **In countries with less economic opportunity, like the Philippines, > Thailand, and Russia, she writes, the number of women in physics is as > high as 30 to 35 percent, versus 5 percent in Canada, Japan, and > Germany.**  
> “It’s the opposite of what we’d expect,” says Pinker. “You’d think the > more family-friendly policies, and richer the economy, the more women > should behave like men, but it’s the opposite. I think with economic > opportunity comes choices, comes freedom.”

A few years back I was browsing through some European data; to my surprise the countries with the highest proportion of math professors were Turkey & the Iberian nations. The lowest? Scandinavia.  
Do you find it implausible that people could actually have an aversion to the sciences despite aptitude or ability? I don’t. [High-Tech Japanese, Running Out of Engineers](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/worldbusiness/17engineers.html?scp=1&sq=japan%20engineering&st=cse):

> Japan is running out of engineers.  
> After years of fretting over coming shortages, the country is actually > facing a dwindling number of young people entering engineering and > technology-related fields.  
> Universities call it “rikei banare,” or “flight from science.” The > decline is growing so drastic that industry has begun advertising > campaigns intended to make engineering look sexy and cool, and > companies are slowly starting to import foreign workers, or sending > jobs to where the engineers are, in Vietnam and India.  
> It was engineering prowess that lifted this nation from postwar defeat > to economic superpower. **But according to educators, executives and > young Japanese themselves, the young here are behaving more like > Americans: choosing better-paying fields like finance and medicine**, > or more purely creative careers, like the arts, rather than following > their salaryman fathers into the unglamorous world of manufacturing.

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of shooting the shit with a bunch of [quants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst); really smart guys, refreshingly little dick-waving (all 25 were male). Most had math or physics doctorates. Instead of doing pure research, there were manipulating financial instruments, and pulling in orders of magnitude more in income per year than they would have ever made as scientists.¹ But it isn’t like a career in science has the tradeoff of security and likelihood to compensate for its modest remuneration; [The Real Science Crisis: Bleak Prospects for Young Researchers](http://chronicle.com/free/v54/i04/04a00102.htm):

> The job market in science is now shifting faster than graduate > programs can keep up, leading often unhappy Ph.D.’s to hunt for > careers far from the academic homes where they hoped their degrees > would lead.  
> Academic and government leaders acknowledge some of these problems and > are attempting to correct them. Major sponsors of science — the > National Science Foundation, the NIH, and the Howard Hughes Medical > Institute — have started programs to help young scientists weather the > rough climate. And a five-year study led by the Carnegie Foundation > for the Advancement of Teaching has assessed reform programs to try to > improve doctoral education across all of academe.

The scientific life is a grind. The system ingests far more than it will “fully process” and convert into full professors. Most will drift off into industry or other domains of life, their dreams crushed, the flower of their youth consumed in a passion which never blooms into a stable relationship. Even among those who become minted PIs (primary investigator) few will be remembered in generations to come. At the end of the day the neverending fame of science is a winner-take-all proposition. Many shall strive, but only an Elect shall be destined for communion with the Great Discovery.  
If not quantity, what about quality? [My experiment with smart drugs](http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=1298):

> The next morning I woke up and felt immediately alert. Normally it > takes a coffee and an hour to kick-start my brain; today I’m ready to > go from the second I rise. And so it continues like this, for five > days: I inhale books and exhale articles effortlessly. My friends all > say I seem more contemplative, less rushed – which is odd, because I’m > doing more than normal. One sixty-something journalist friend says she > remembers taking Benzadrine in the sixties to get through marathon > articles, but she’d collapse after four or five says and need a long, > long sleep. I don’t feel like that. I keep waiting for an exhausted > crash, and it doesn’t seem to come.  
> When the American journalist David Plotz took Provigil, he said it > should be given a slogan. Just as valium was marketed as “the > housewife’s little helper,” he said this should be sold as “the boss’ > little helper.” It makes you work better and harder than before.

1 – This is not the best year for quants. But no one is asking that they return the money they made earlier.
