Why some like it spicy?

[Think Gene](http://www.thinkgene.com/some-like-it-hot-structure-of-receptor-for-hot-chili-pepper-and-pain-revealed/) points me to a new PNAS paper, [Structure of TRPV1 channel revealed by electron cryomicroscopy](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0711835105v1?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=TRPV1&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=date&resourcetype=HWCIT):

> The transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels > participate in many signaling pathways. TRPV1 functions as a molecular > integrator of noxious stimuli, including heat, low pH, and chemical > ligands. Here, we report the 3D structure of full-length rat TRPV1 > channel expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified > by immunoaffinity chromatography. We demonstrate that the recombinant > purified TRPV1 channel retains its structural and functional integrity > and is suitable for structural analysis. The 19-A structure of TRPV1 > determined by using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy exhibits > fourfold symmetry and comprises two distinct regions: a large open > basket-like domain, likely corresponding to the cytoplasmic N- and > C-terminal portions, and a more compact domain, corresponding to the > transmembrane portion. The assignment of transmembrane and cytoplasmic > regions was supported by fitting crystal structures of the > structurally homologous Kv1.2 channel and isolated TRPV1 ankyrin > repeats into the TRPV1 structure.

[Think Gene](http://www.thinkgene.com/some-like-it-hot-structure-of-receptor-for-hot-chili-pepper-and-pain-revealed/) and [Scientific Blogging](http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/electron_cryomicroscopy_takes_a_look_at_trpv1_protein_pain_receptor_in_3_d) have summaries of the paper. [Proteins are great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1), but what about the genes which produce them? I went to [haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm), and check out what I foundâ€¦.
