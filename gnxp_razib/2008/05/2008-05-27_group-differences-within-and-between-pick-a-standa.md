Group differences – within and between – pick a standard please!

The debate over at [The American Scene](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/05/23/undetermined) on Jim Manzi’s article [*“Undetermined”*](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Undetermined:+there+is+danger+in+assuming+that+genes+explain+all.-a0179208479) is now closed to comments so I couldn’t respond to one of the comments but the beauty of being a blogger is that you can use your own forum to vent your response.

The comment that I desperately wanted to respond to was left by Joe Shipman and reads as [follows](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/05/23/undetermined#c003704):

Joe, will you join with me in advocating the complete dismantling of efforts to ameliorate the racial and gender wage gaps that exist, in that they too demonstrate that wage variability is larger within groups than between groups? I hit on this [topic](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/liberal-duality-on-lewontinism.php) a few years ago:

> It is important to recognize that **most wage inequality occurs within > and not between groups.** The unweighted average Gini coefficient > across all race, gender, and education groups was 0.256 in 1995, over > 80 percent of the total Gini.

You know, if it’s unAmerican and unscientific to craft social policy on observed group differences then surely the fact that the variability in Black or Hispanic incomes is greater within their groups than it is between their group and, say, Caucasians or Asians, is an unscientific and unAmerican basis upon which to craft social policy to address the between group differences in income. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right Joe?
