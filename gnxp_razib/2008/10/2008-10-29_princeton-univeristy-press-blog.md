Princeton Univeristy Press blog

[Princeon University Press](http://press.princeton.edu/) now has a [weblog](http://press.princeton.edu/blog/). It looks like a good idea in terms of getting publicity for authors of academic books (and ideally, you get some value-add in terms of insight and experience). I wonder if [Andrew Gelman’s](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/blog/) editor has tried to figure out how many extra copies of [d State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069113927X/geneexpressio-20) were pushed because of he blogospheric publicity? Of course his sort of publicity will start to be less powerful once most academics start to publicize their work ahead of publication via web communication channels.
