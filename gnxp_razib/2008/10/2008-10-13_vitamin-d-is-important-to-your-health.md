Vitamin D is important to your health?

The August issue of *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, has a [supplement](http://www.ajcn.org/content/vol88/issue2/#SUPPLEMENT__VITAMIN_D_AND_HEALTH_IN_THE___ST_CENTURY__AN_UPDATE) of articles, [Vitamin D and Health in the 21st Century Update](http://www.ajcn.org/content/vol88/issue2/#SUPPLEMENT__VITAMIN_D_AND_HEALTH_IN_THE___ST_CENTURY__AN_UPDATE). *ScienceDaily* has some quotes from one of the main researchers:

> … Norman identifies vitamin D’s potential for contributions to good > health in the **adaptive and innate immune systems,** the secretion > and regulation of insulin by the pancreas, the heart and blood > pressure regulation, muscle strength and brain activity. In addition, > access to adequate amounts of vitamin D is believed to be beneficial > towards reducing the risk of cancer.

I think a focus on the immune system is important from an evolutionary perspective.
