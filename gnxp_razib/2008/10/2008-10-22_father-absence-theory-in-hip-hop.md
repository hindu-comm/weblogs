Father Absence theory in hip-hop

I’ve been somewhat out of the loop of hip hop music, though I’m catching up. A club that I go to regularly has been playing a song whose [lyrics](http://www.lyricstime.com/teairra-mari-no-daddy-lyrics.html) argue for the [Father Absence theory](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=%2B%22father+absence%22&btnG=Search) of why some people grow up to be wilder than others. ([See the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLNAc3RqQ48).)

It used to be that art referred to theories that weren’t even plausible on their face — Freud’s idea of the Oedipus Complex being one. Whether Teairra Mari’s song “No Daddy” reflects a shift over time to more plausible ideas, or simply the contrast between moronic intellectuals and those who believe their lying eyes, I couldn’t say. Also unknown is whether she’s read Harpending & Draper (1982) or just figured it out on her own. If the latter, she must have been pretty perceptive, as the song was released when she was 17.
