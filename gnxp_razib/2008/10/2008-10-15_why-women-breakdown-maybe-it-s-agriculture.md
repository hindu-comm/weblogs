Why women breakdown; maybe it's agriculture?

[Why Do Women Get More Cavities Than Men?](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081014111046.htm):

Honestly, my first thought was “maybe women just like sugar more?” In any case, one thing I assume is that the higher “fertility” of agricultural women is going to be due to the fact that they do not space their births. In contrast, hunter-gatherer women typically have a reduced number of pregnancies because ofbehaviors such as extended breastfeeding. Of course, most agricultural societies quickly reached the Malthusian limit (ecological carrying capacity), so the higher fertility was likely balanced out by higher infant mortality. If agricultural women gave birth to more infants a greater proportion of these offspring ended up dying of diseases, etc., than for hunter-gatherers. So at birth any given hunter-gatherer infant is far more likely to reach reproductive age than any given offspring of peasants….
