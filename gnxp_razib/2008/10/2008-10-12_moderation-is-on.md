Moderation is on

I’ve received a few emails which suggest that not everyone is aware that I’ve turned “moderation” on. That means I have to approve your comment. It was going to be a temporary measure, but so far I rather like how it’s working out, so I’ll leave it on. If I’m going to be away from the computer for more than 24 hours I’ll probably turn it off temporarily, but otherwise expect latency on when your comments show up after posting.
