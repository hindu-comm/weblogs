Russian dudes are imperialists

[Dynamics of Alliance Formation and the Egalitarian Revolution](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003293):

> **Background**: >
> Arguably the most influential force in human history is the formation > of social coalitions and alliances (i.e., long-lasting coalitions) and > their impact on individual power. Understanding the dynamics of > alliance formation and its consequences for biological, social, and > cultural evolution is a formidable theoretical challenge. In most > great ape species, coalitions occur at individual and group levels and > among both kin and non-kin. Nonetheless, ape societies remain > essentially hierarchical, and coalitions rarely weaken social > inequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable > tendency to egalitarianism, and human coalitions and alliances occur > not only among individuals and groups, but also among groups of > groups. These observations suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of > human coalitions can only be understood in the context of social > networks and cognitive evolution.

**Their conclusion:**

> We propose a simple and flexible theoretical approach for studying the > dynamics of alliance emergence applicable where game-theoretic methods > are not practical. Our approach is both scalable and expandable. It is > scalable in that it can be generalized to larger groups, or groups of > groups. It is expandable in that it allows for inclusion of additional > factors such as behavioral, genetic, social, and cultural features. > Our results suggest that a rapid transition from a hierarchical > society of great apes to an egalitarian society of hunter-gatherers > (often referred to as â€œegalitarian revolutionâ€?) could indeed > follow an increase in human cognitive abilities. The establishment of > stable group-wide egalitarian alliances creates conditions promoting > the origin of cultural norms favoring the group interests over those > of individuals.

The title is a joke because the lead author is Sergey Gavrilets, who is a product of Moscow State University in the 1970s, just like [Peter Turchin](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=peter+turchin&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com). And like Turchin Gavrilets is all over the place trying to produce formal models to elucidate a range of diverse questions. Gavrilets’ [research interests](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gavrila/Research.htm) are social and cultural evolution, speciation and adaptive radiation, sexual conflict, holey fitness landscapes (this is how I knew him originally) and microevolutionary processes and macroevolutionary patterns. Good luck with all that, as they say….
