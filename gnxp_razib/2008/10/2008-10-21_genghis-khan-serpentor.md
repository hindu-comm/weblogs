Genghis Khan → Serpentor?

![Gijoe23.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Gijoe23.jpg?resize=211%2C320)![Gijoe23.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Gijoe23.jpg?resize=211%2C320)[Finding Hidden Tomb Of Genghis Khan Using Non-Invasive Technologies](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081017081030.htm). Cool right? My first thought was [Serpentor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentor):

> …He was created through a breakthrough in cloning research by Dr. > Mindbender from the DNA extracted from the unearthed remains of the > most ruthless and effective military leaders in history, including > Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Attila the Hun, Philip II of > Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad the > Impaler, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, and Grigori Rasputin….

With ancient DNA extraction techniques if there’s genetic material perhaps we could actually check if the [Y-chromosomal lineage](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract&artid=1180246) adduced to be that of Temujin is actually his. And if Temujin, why not others?
