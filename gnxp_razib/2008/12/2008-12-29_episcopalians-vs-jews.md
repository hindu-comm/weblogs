Episcopalians vs. Jews

A few days ago the [Audacious Epigone](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/12/inductivist-reaffirms-utility-of-gss.html) pointed out that Episcopalians are in the same neighborhood as Jews in the United States on intelligence tests; i.e., on the order of a bit more than 2/3 of a standard deviation above the norm. The recent paper on religion & IQ confirmed these findings. One of the peculiarities of American Jews is how liberal they are; the old saying was that they “live like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans.” With the rise of the Religious Right Episcopalians are actually starting to vote more like Jews; the [Pew Religious Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/table-party-affiliation-by-protestant-denomination.pdf) suggests that 49% are now Democrats or Democrat leaning, while 42% are Republicans or Republican leaning. But in any case, I was curious, **how different are Jews and Episcopalians?** And, how do both these groups relate to white Protestants as a whole, who I tend to think are the archetypical “control” in the American context. So I you probably know what I did next: looked in the GSS. If you click to read the whole post, a whole lot of charts….
