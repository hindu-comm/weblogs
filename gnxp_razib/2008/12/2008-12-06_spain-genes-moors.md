Spain, genes & Moors

[The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(08)00592-2):

Dienekes has [offered his criticisms](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/12/major-study-of-iberian-y-chromosomes.html), and I generally agree. Thereâ€™s something funny going on here. These are paternal lineages, so this is where you would likely find the highest proportion of genes which suggest North African ancestry. Remember that water makes a big difference when it come to gene flow; it seems that even what seems a trivial water barrier blocks the deme-to-deme migration of individuals which results in small but persistent flows which equilibrate between group differences. So it seems plausible that incontrovertible North African lineages would be Berber provenance and due to the impact of the Muslim conquest. But, the historical data makes clear that the **native Muslim populations also derived in large part from local converts, including portions of the Visigothic nobility.**  
If you read a book like [The Victors and the Vanquished: Christians and Muslims of Catalonia and Aragon, 1050-1300](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521036445/geneexpressio-20) you can see that it is relatively adduce from tax and legal records that substantial Muslim minorities long remained in Christian polities even during advanced phases of the reconquest, on the order of 20-30%. After 1492 the Jews were expelled, while many of the elite Muslims emigrated to North Africa, with those who remained tending to convert to Christianity. Though many Muslims did convert to the Catholic religion, in areas of southern Spain where ex-Muslims were still the majority and Arabic was still the local language conversion was nominal and the Islamic religion persisted for generations. This is why \~1600 the crypto-Muslims, Moriscos, were expelled from the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon in an instance of ethnic cleansing. I use the term ethnic cleansing because Moriscos who were sincere Christians were also expelled, these generally settling in the southern Italian possessions of the crown of Aragon.  
So why are there are still the possible signatures North African ancestry? Because large numbers of Muslims, likely the majority, converted to Catholicism in the century between the fall of Granada and the expulsion of Moriscos. In fact, the majority of the Muslims of the Iberian peninsula had lived under Christian rulers since \~1250, and of these many had converted to Christianity even by 1492. The expulsion of 1600 occurred in the context of foreign adventures of the Spanish state in North Africa, combined with the fear of fifth columnists in southern Spain, who had already rebelled several times and received some aid from the co-religions and the Andalusian diaspora in Morocco. Some of the Spanish notables who argued for the expulsion were themselves of documented Morisco ancestry, and it may be that their argument for the removal of communities whose religious loyalties were under question also removed any possible taint against themselves.  
It seems that the necessary complement to these sorts of studies would be to examine evidence for Iberian lineages in communities in Morocco and Algeria where it is known that Andalusian exiles settled in large numbers. If it is true that the Muslims of Spain were in large part converts from the indigenous populations, despite their partial North African provenance, then that should be manifest in their genetic heritage.
