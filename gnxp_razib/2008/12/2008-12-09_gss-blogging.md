GSS blogging

At [Secular Right](http://secularright.org/wordpress/?p=714) I stated:

> Right now only a few weblogs (that I know of!) seem to make regular > recourse to the GSS when confronted with a question amenable to > inquiry. [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/), [The > Audacious Epigone](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/) and to a lesser > extent [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/). I wish there were more > weblogs out there where individuals would take 10 minutes out of their > day to double-check their intuitions (on occasion my co-bloggers at > [GNXP](http://gnxp.com/) also do GSS data analysis). So with that in > mind, if you are inclined to start blogging GSS data, email me at > contactgnxp – at – gmail – dot – com. I will add your blog to the > blogrolls of both my Gene Expression weblogs, which should give you > some Google Pagerank juice. If your posts are topical to the material > of Secular Right I would also be inclined to like to you from posts on > this weblog.

I’ll go further, if a few of these blogs pop up, or come to my attention, I’ll do link roundups to try and drive traffic. I might also look into setting up an aggregator site.
