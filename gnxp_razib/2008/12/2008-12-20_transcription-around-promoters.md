Transcription around promoters

[](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5909/1849/FIG1)  
A number of papers out this week (summarized [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/322/5909/1804)) notice, using various technologies, the presence of extensive transcription off both DNA strands around active promoters. A figure from [one of the papers](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5909/1849) is above–note the peak in transcription from the sense strand just downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), and the peak in anti-sense transcription just upstream of the TSS. This is an interesting observation, and an example of the unexpected things you can see with new technologies, but no one is exactly sure what to make of it–it could just be the transcriptional machinery being a bit sloppy.
