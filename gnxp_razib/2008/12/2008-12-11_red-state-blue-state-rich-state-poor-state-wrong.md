Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State…wrong?

[The Audacious Epigone](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/12/red-state-blue-state-rich-state-poor.html) has a [long critique](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/12/red-state-blue-state-rich-state-poor.html) of Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State. The main criticism is that Andrew Gelman did not emphasize the affect that race has on voting patterns enough; a criticism brought to sharper focus by the 2008 election.
