Complex traits & evolution

[Adaptive Complexity](http://www.scientificblogging.com/adaptive_complexity/blog/when_physicists_try_talk_genetics_2) takes issue at a post over at [Information Processing](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/01/no-scientific-basis-for-race.html) over race & genetics. On that specific topic, let me just quote [Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-luigi-luca-cavalli.php):

But that’s not what I want to talk about. Michael at Adaptive Complexity says:

Quantitative polygenic phenotypes such as intelligence and height would be “Complicated traits, involving many genes with likely pleiotropic effects.” Earlier he says:

> there has been a fairly substantial amount of gene flow among human > populations over the last 50k years, which tends to act against > population differentiation. Given what we know about human population > history, and the likelihood that a very complex trait like > intelligence is controlled by many genes with pleiotropic effects, **I > find it implausible that significant differences in intelligence > between populations have arisen over the past 50k years.**

I need to open my quantitative genetics textbooks again perhaps, but I’m a little confused by this. **We already have a great deal of extant variation on quantitative traits like intelligence and height.** In other words, there’s a lot of variation out there that doesn’t seem to have deleterious consequences for selection to work from. I don’t get why 50,000 years just isn’t long enough for natural selection to shift the distribution of phenotypes when we already have a great deal of heritable variation across our species. The rate of phenotypic change is rather simple for a quantitative trait; it is proportional to heritability (which is a nice proxy for the correlation between the phenotype and genotype on the population level) and strength of selection. Because this process is reducible the same can be said of traits dominated by genes of large effect, though here we would would probably substitute the term [penetrance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance) for heritability.  
What am I missing? (a citation to a page of Mike Lynch’s [Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934812/geneexpressio-20/) would be nice)
