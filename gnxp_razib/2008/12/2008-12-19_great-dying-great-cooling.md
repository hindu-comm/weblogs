Great Dying = Great Cooling?

This is really weird, [New World Post-pandemic Reforestation Helped Start Little Ice Age, Say Scientists](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081218094551.htm):

> Stanford University researchers have conducted a comprehensive > analysis of data detailing the amount of charcoal contained in soils > and lake sediments at the sites of both pre-Columbian population > centers in the Americas and in sparsely populated surrounding regions. > They concluded that reforestation of agricultural lands–abandoned as > the population collapsed–**pulled so much carbon out of the atmosphere > that it helped trigger a period of global cooling, at its most intense > from approximately 1500 to 1750, known as the Little Ice Age.**

The same researchers published a paper on this last spring, [Effects of syn-pandemic fire reduction and reforestation in the tropical Americas on atmospheric CO2 during European conquest](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V6R-4S4JYYD-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=60ea821b0c2b90ccdfa33d5005935ac9):

> A new reconstruction of Late Holocene biomass burning in the tropical > Americas is consistent with the expansion of fire use by Mesoamerican > and Amazonian agriculturalists and a subsequent period of fire > reduction beginning 500 years BP. The marked reduction of biomass > burning after 500 years BP, a unique feature of the fire history of > the tropical Americas relative to other regions of the globe, is > synchronous with the collapse of the American indigenous population > during pandemics accompanying European conquest. We predict that fire > reduction contemporaneous with pandemics in the tropical Americas was > associated with massive forest regeneration on 5 × 105 km2 of land and > sequestration of 5-10 Gt C into the terrestrial biosphere, which > contributed to the 2% global reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels and > the 0.1‰ increase in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 from 1500 to 1750 A.D. > This study 1) builds upon prior fire history reconstructions by > synthesizing a substantially greater number of stratigraphic charcoal > accumulation records and soil charcoal 14C dates to resolve features > of the Late Holocene biomass burning record in the tropical Americas; > and 2) corroborates the hypothesis advanced by Ruddiman \[Ruddiman, > W.F., 2003. The Anthropogenic Era began thousands of years ago. > Climatic Change 61, 261-293, Ruddiman, W.F., 2005. Plows, Plagues, and > Petroleum.
