Human variation proportional to distance from Africa?

[Distance from Africa, not climate, explains within-population phenotypic diversity in humans](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/567208lt52062301/):

The use of skull-traits is a little 1930s…but a trait is a trait. For you anatomy nerds (of which, I am not one), the list of traits is below the fold. And no, cephalic index is not on the list….

6. Maximum frontal breadth (XFB)  
7. Biauricular breadth (M11)
