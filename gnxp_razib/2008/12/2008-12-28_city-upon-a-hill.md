City upon a Hill

Samuel Huntington [died yesterday](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/us/28huntington.html?pagewanted=print). Though famous for his [Clash of Civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_P._Huntington#The_Clash_of_Civilizations) thesis, more recently he argued for an emphasis on the reality that this (the United States) is an [Anglo-Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Are_We%3F_The_Challenges_to_America's_National_Identity) country. But I think that this assertion needs to clarified to a finer grained scale. In [Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056//geneexpressio-20), the author makes the claim that the culture of the United States is a synthesis of four strands of colonial settlers; New England Puritans, the Lowland Southerners (e.g., Tidewater Planters), the Highland Southerners (i.e., the Scots-Irish of Appalachia) and the polyglot peoples of the Mid-Atlantic (e.g., Quakers of Philadelphia, Dutch Patroons of New York and Swedes of Delaware, etc.). After reading quite a bit of American history, especially the period between 1600 and 1850, I think that over the long haul the concrete political and social realities of America owe much more to New England than the other regions. ÂAfter I came to this conclusion (which I will flesh in more detail later), I couldn’t help but note that today New England isn’t included in the “Real America.”
