Complex traits & evolution – follow up

[Mike White](http://www.scientificblogging.com/adaptive_complexity/blog/when_physicists_try_talk_genetics_2) finally left a comment on my post Complex traits & evolution:

I disagree that alleles of large effect are necessary. We already have a large range of extant variation across human populations. From what I can tell about the Breeder’s Equation QTLs of large effect are not needed.
