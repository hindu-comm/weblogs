The Perfect BabyTM

[Genetic Future](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/which-baby-do-you-want-dilemma-for-21st.html) points me to a *Nature News* story, [Making babies: the next 30 years](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080716/full/454260a.html). He highlights this section:

The details are important here. Height is a [tough cookie](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/tall-loci-genetics-of-height.php); it seems like there are going to *at least* hundreds of loci which control most of the normal human variation (if not thousands). But blondness is a bad example; [pigmentation](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=pigmentation+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) is only controlled by a few loci.

That doesn’t mean the parents don’t have to have the variation necessary, they do, but they can probably guarantee a little blonde beast if they have the potentiality. And it seems that this really isn’t a function of the genetic *future*, the number of embryos parents would need to guarantee a little Aryan baby if they both have Aryan blood isn’t that high (probably 10-100 embryos depending on the purity of Aryan blood of the parents).  
In any case, read the [Genetic Future post](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/which-baby-do-you-want-dilemma-for-21st.html) for the bigger picture.
