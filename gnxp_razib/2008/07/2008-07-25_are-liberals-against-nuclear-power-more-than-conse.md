Are liberals against nuclear power more than conservatives? Yes

Because of the increased prices in gasoline and the perception of scarcity in terms of power, there has been a lot of talk about nuclear. There have been many comments of late from the Right that the Left is opposed to the utilization of nuclear power, and often gleeful the observation that many European countries such as France and Sweden are highly reliant on this technology. But is it true that liberals are more averse to nuclear than conservatives? I checked the GSS for the following questions:  
– Nuclear power dangerous to the environment?  
– Likelihood of nuclear meltdown in 5 years?  
– Nuclear power a danger to my family?  
The tables below show the proportion of various ideologies in terms of responses to these questions. The responses to the left are more nuclear skeptical than those to the right.

Also, in case you are curious, **more educated people tend to be less terrified of nuclear power too.** If you want to check in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss06), the nuclear variable codes are NUKEGEN, NUKEACC and NUKEFAM.
