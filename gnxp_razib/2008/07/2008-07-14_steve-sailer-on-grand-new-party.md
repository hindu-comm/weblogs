Steve Sailer on Grand New Party

Steve’s [review](http://vdare.com/sailer/080713_ideas.htm) of [Grand New Party](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385519435/geneexpressio-20) is up. He suggests that much of [GNP](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385519435/geneexpressio-20) is laced with Sailerian wisdom; I think that’s a fairly plausible point, though [Ross](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/) & [Reihan](http://theamericanscene.com/) might claim other sources for the derivation of particular observations or datum. I’ve read about 3/4 of [Grand New Party](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385519435/geneexpressio-20). I don’t talk much about politics because I don’t feel like I know much about it, and frankly, I don’t allocate many cognitive cycles to the topic (though I do follow politics via my RSS, it’s mostly a passive pursuit). Nevertheless, I’ve liked [GNP](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385519435/geneexpressio-20) mostly because the argument and perspective is relatively thickly scaffolded with data which is of a fundamentally apolitical character. I can say the same of one of the few other political books I’ve read in the past year, Brink Lindsey’s [Age of Abundance](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060747676/geneexpressio-20). I’ll be putting up a review of [GNP](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385519435/geneexpressio-20) [at my other weblog](http://www.scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) soon; I suspect it’ll be the first positive review of a right-wing book on [Scienceblogs](http://www.scienceblogs.com/), so I’ll count myself a trailblazer after I click “post”!

Update: [Ross clarifies](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/credit_where_credit_is_due.php) (I found the UK working class descriptions to be the sore thumb as well).
