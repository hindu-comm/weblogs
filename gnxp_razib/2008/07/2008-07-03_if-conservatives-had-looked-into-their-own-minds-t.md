If conservatives had looked into their own minds they would not have been able to see there whom they were speaking of

[The Political Mind, Part III (Chapter 2)](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2008/07/the_political_mind_part_iii_ch.php), Chris sayeth:

> Anyway, now on to that part I promised you about how real > conservatives don’t exist, or at least not in great numbers. Towards > the end of this chapter, Lakoff gives us the concept of > “biconceptualism.” This means that some people have both progressive > and conservative thoughts — that is, they dig obedience in some areas > of politics, and empathy in others (the two are mutually > contradictory, so they certainly can’t go together in the same > political policy!). Unfortunately for us progressives, most > conservatives don’t realize they’re really biconceptuals. Or as Lakoff > puts it, “Many self-identified ‘conservatives’ have many, many > progressive views without being aware of it” (p. 70). That’s because > these things are all unconscious (that’s true, they are), and separate > in our brains (that’s probably true too), so conservatives never > consciously run into contradictions in their thinking, even though > they’re really mostly progressives. You see, “biconceptualism is > simply a fact about brains” (p. 71), and research has shown that we > can resolve contradictions unconsciously (he throws in some gratuitous > neuroscience here to tell us which regions of the brain neuroimagers > have guessed this might, possibly, if we squint really hard at the > data, take place in). Oh, and some bullshit about neural binding is in > there too. Ugh.
