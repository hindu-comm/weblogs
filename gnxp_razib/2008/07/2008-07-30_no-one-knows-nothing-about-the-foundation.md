No one knows nothing about The Foundation

Chris Orr at [The Plank](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/07/30/a-solid-foundation.aspx) reports that Isaac Asimov’s [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) is going to be given the film treatment. Orr is skeptical, and so am I. As far as [space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera) goes the Foundation universe was a cerebral and sedate treatment; they’ll have to rewrite a lot of it to get some action to spice up the story. David Brin’s [Uplift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_Universe) based novels read much more like the outlines of scripts; but after [The Postman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postman) they probably won’t want to risk that. Even if there’s a lot going on space opera doesn’t always translate well. Remember David Lynch’s take on [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(film))? Because of the success of Peter Jackson’s [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy) trilogy I suppose the film industry will go on this turn-novel-series-into-film-series kick for a while. I think after the disappointment of [The Golden Compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Compass_(film)) one has to admit that Jackson ended up making *good films*, and you can’t just assume that the “based on” formula is going to make an endeavor a success.
