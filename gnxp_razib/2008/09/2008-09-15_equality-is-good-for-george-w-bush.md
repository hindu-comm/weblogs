Equality is good for George W. Bush?

In response to the debate between [David Frum](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07Inequality-t.html?_r=3&em=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin&oref=slogin) and [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/09/where_are_the_r.html) about whether inequality is bad for Republicans, [Jim Manzi](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/09/15/do-more-unequal-places-tend-to-vote-for-democrats) [crunches some data](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/09/15/do-more-unequal-places-tend-to-vote-for-democrats). Below is Manzi’s chart which shows that as you increase inequality (shifting to the right) you decrease the percentage of those voting for George W. Bush (decreasing along the Y axis). **Read Manzi’s [whole post](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/09/15/do-more-unequal-places-tend-to-vote-for-democrats) for methods and interpretation!** The only thing I would add, which Manzi alludes to, is that interaction effect between regions and inequality probably matters, tying back to Gelman’s point that Frum should be cautious about extrapolating from the bi-coastal exemplars.
