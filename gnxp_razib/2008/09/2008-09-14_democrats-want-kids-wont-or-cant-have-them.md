Democrats want kids; won’t or can’t have them

A few years ago it was [shown](http://www.amconmag.com/article/2004/dec/20/0004/) that white America fertility correlated 0.86 to voting for George W. Bush in 2004 on a state by state level. What that means is pretty simple, if you have the 50 states + DC, and plot their white fertility on the X axis and % voting for George W. Bush on the Y axis the variation of X could predict about 3/4 of the variation of Y. That’s pretty good. **But what about on an individual level?** The differences here aren’t so stark. In short, those whites who voted for John F. Kerry wanted nearly as many children as those whites who voted for George W. Bush. They simply didn’t have them.
