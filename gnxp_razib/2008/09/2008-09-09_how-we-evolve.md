How We Evolve

![](https://i0.wp.com/seedmagazine.com/news/uploads/Iss18_Cover_inside.jpg?w=640)![](https://i0.wp.com/seedmagazine.com/news/uploads/Iss18_Cover_inside.jpg?w=640)The most recent issue of *Seed Magazine* has a cover story that readers of this weblog might find of interest, *How We Evolve*. It’s not online, but its basic core is the [acceleration](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=acceleration+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) of [recent human evolution](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=recent+human+evolution+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search). [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) seems to be the primary source. The author, Benjamin Phelan, made a good faith effort to explain concepts like linkage disequilibrium, the Shifting Balance (by implication) and haplotype structure. I have some qualms about the piece, which I will moot at some point in the near future, but I think if you find some of the population genetics references on this blog opaque Phelan’s article may provide some illumination.
