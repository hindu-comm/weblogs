They f**k you up, your genes…AVPR1A that is

The post below on *AVPR1A* and fidelity alluded to the fact that this locus has been implicated in many other behavioral traits. I spent some of today digging through the literature. So check it….  
[AVPR1a and SLC6A4 Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Creative Dance Performance](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010042)

Let me quote from the last study:

In other words, the molecular genetic processes which might underlay all these coarse phenotypic variations might be rather simple, the extent of the repeated genomic region has a proportional relationship to the dosage of the gene product. The product itself has a proportional relationship to particular phenotypes. Many of these behavioral traits are probably mediated by some global personality trait which affects them; e.g., impulsiveness modulating time preference and the ability to consider how selfish actions in the near term might affect one’s life in the long term. Also, let me reiterate that the balance between various repeat length alleles on this locus might be governed by simple [hawk-dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Dove_game) dynamics.
