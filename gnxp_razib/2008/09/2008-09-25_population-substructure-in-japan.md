Population substructure in Japan

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/09/population-structure-in-japan-with-140k.html) points me to a new paper, [Japanese Population Structure, Based on SNP Genotypes from 7003 Individuals Compared to Other Ethnic Groups: Effects on Population-Based Association Studies](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(08)00487-4):

Nothing too surprising; much of the variation seems to follow axis of the Japanese archipelago. Remember that EDAR is a locus implicated in the typical form of many East Asians, and seems to have been under recent selection in that region. ABCC11 also seems to exhibit the same pattern in terms of worldwide frequency. Dienekes also [posted](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ro2ijOk8JWc/SNvUkykBMQI/AAAAAAAAAWw/C4Y0nj-2Hq8/s1600-h/japan.jpg) some of the PC plots.
