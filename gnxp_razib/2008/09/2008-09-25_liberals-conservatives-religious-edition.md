Liberals & conservatives; religious edition

[What if there were no God? Politically conservative and liberal Christians imagine their lives without faith](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WM0-4T4HP25-2&_user=10&_coverDate=08/03/2008&_rdoc=4&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236920%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=6920&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=33&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9c02a841890cb02581c5a7b389aead3b):

In accord with theoretical writings > regarding normative and humanistic ideologies, the findings suggest > that, at least among American Christians, **political conservatism may > entail a fear of, or strong sensitivity to, the prospects of conflict > and chaos, whereas political liberalism may entail an equally strong > fear of, or sensitivity to, emptiness.**

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924124549.htm) has a [serviceable summary](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924124549.htm). Seems close to “they had to do a study???” category of research. But seems like you can integrate this with the trend of political orientation tracking [Openness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience)….  
**Related:** Conservatives have more fear.
