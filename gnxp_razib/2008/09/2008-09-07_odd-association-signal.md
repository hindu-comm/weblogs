Odd association signal

So while skimming [this paper](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.219.html) on a genome-wide association study of leukemia, I noticed one of their hits falls in the gene [IRF4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF4). What other phenotype has variation in this same region been associated with? [Pigmentation](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/05/hair-color-and-skin-pigmentation-in.php). Of course, the actual causal polymorphisms in each case aren’t known, but still, kind of an interesting fact.
