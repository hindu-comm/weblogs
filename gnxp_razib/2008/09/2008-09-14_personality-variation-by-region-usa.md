Personality variation by region (USA)

Update: [Another post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/09/new_yorkers_do_need_to_see_the.php) where I’ve transcribed the [highest correlations](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/09/new_yorkers_do_need_to_see_the.php) for each trait.

Jason pointed me to this *Guardian* piece, [US personalities vary by region, say researchers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/11/usa.research). It’s pretty thin on the details, but luckily the original paper can be found online in full, [A Theory of the Emergence, Persistence, and Expression of Geographic Variation in Psychological Characteristics](http://web.mac.com/jrentfrow/iWeb/Dr.%20Peter%20Jason%20Rentfrow/PJR%20Publications_files/Rentfrow--Geography%20of%20Personality.pdf). I haven’t read the whole thing, nor do I know much about personality, so I have put the maps which illustrate regional variation in traits below the fold. But I do want to note the correlations between [Openness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience) and the following metrics on the state level:

% Arts and entertainment = 0.23  
% Computer and mathematical = 0.24  
Patent production per capita = 0.28

\* Controlling for income, race, sex, college degree, and proportion of state population living in city with one million or more residents. *p* \< 0.05.
