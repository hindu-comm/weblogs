Lactase persistence in Britain

[Lactase persistence-related genetic variant: population substructure and health outcomes](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ejhg2008156a.html):

Interesting. I can’t help but point out that the frequency of the LP allele follows the gradient of the *decrease* in Anglo-Saxon ancestry by any measure. This is relevant because the area focused around Jutland is where the modal frequency of the LP allele exists. So this could just be an artifact of demographic history.
