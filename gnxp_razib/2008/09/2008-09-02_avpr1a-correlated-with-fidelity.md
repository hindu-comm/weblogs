AVPR1A correlated with fidelity?

Over the years I’ve blogged a fair amount on the [AVPR1A](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=AVPR1A++site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) gene. Variation on this locus has been associated with differences altruism in humans and mating preferences in voles. Now a new paper is out in *PNAS*, at some point in the near future (not online, but will be [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/09/02/0803081105.abstract)), which shows differences in martial behavior based on [AVPR1A](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=552). From [Study Links Gene Variant in Men to Marital Discord](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090102087_pf.html):

> **About 40 percent of men have one or two copies of the allele.** > Walum, a PhD student, said that men with two copies of the allele had > a greater risk of marital discord than men with one copy, and that men > with one copy of the allele were at more risk of such discord than men > with no copies. The study asked men in married or long-term > relationships whether they had experienced relationship crises in the > past year that were of such intensity that they considered divorce or > splitting. The scientists also asked the wives and partners of the men > what it was like to live with them, examining levels of affection, > cohesion, consensus and satisfaction.

So again, another indication that personality morphs might be controlled by genes of large effect. Not surprisingly it is suggested that AVPR1A has global implications, it is embedded in a G Matrix not doubt. It is notable that AVPR1A seems to have similar effects in both voles and humans, two very distant lineages among mammals. But, remember the reuse of [Opsins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin) for vision. There are some priors which suggest that particular genes will reemerge as important variables independently across many lineages. Convergences between voles and humans in terms of our mating behaviors might naturally result in the importance of AVPR1A as an independent variable which can be used to track variation. Finally, I think it is likely that the variation we see in AVPR1A is probably frequency dependent in terms of its dynamics; there is a stable equilibrium ratio in any given environment for the various alleles.
