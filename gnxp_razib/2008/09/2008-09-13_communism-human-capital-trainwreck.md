Communism = Human capital trainwreck

The [Epigone](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/), [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/) and [Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/) look at a lot of American state-level data. But I have started to get curious about other countries. I’ve heard weird things like the claim that at some point in the 1990s northern Italy was the wealthiest part of Europe. I don’t know about Italy yet (Italy at one point had a higher per capita GDP than the UK though), but I was curious at inequality in the German states and how it might relate to confession (Protestant or Catholic). I didn’t find any religious trend of major note, but the gap between the former East German Lander and those of the West in per capita GDP as late as 2001 shocking (more recent data is welcome, I might look myself). To get a sense of, it looks that as if the between-lander differences are on the order of what you might see across [American states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_capita_%28nominal%29#2006_Rankings_.28Latest_Available.29), from Connecticut to Mississippi. To be fair to the komrades, the economically and socially dynamic regions of Germany have often been to the southwest near the Rhine and mineral resources, so it seems likely that Baden-Wurttemberg had a head start even before World War II.
