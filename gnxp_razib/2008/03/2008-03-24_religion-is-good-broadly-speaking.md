Religion is good (broadly speaking)

Via [Over Coming Bias](http://overcomingbias.com/), [The science of religion – Where angels no longer fear to tread](http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10875666):

Any bets on what’s causing this? I suspect low dopamine individuals are less likely to be socially conforming, so the effect on religiosity might be weaker in a society where religion is less important than the United States. But nice to see some neurochemical work on this. In the future perhaps neuroscientists will be able to advise parents on the optimal mixture of the “soup” in their offsprings’ brains to increase the chances of religiosity, or decrease it? ([Randall Parker](http://futurepundit.com/) has been talking about this for years)

But probably the most interesting reported research in the piece has to do with group selection & functionalism:

These sorts of data are relatively persuave to me about the functional power of religious institutions and social dynamics. Of course, apparent deviations from the trendline will be important to examine too. This is the closest thing to a website I could find for the [Explaining Religion Project](http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/research/cam/projects/explaining_religion/).
