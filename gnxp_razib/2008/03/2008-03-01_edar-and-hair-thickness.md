EDAR and hair thickness

Razib [mentioned](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/edar-controls-hair-thickness.php) this research before; the relevant paper has now [been published](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/6/835?etoc):

The story goes that a nonsynonymous mutation in EDAR arose after the split between European and Asian groups and quickly swept up in frequency due to some (unknown) force. In terms of mechanism, the authors suggest the change in EDAR alters levels of expression of a transcription factor involved in hair morphogenesis.
