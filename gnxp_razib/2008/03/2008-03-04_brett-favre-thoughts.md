Brett Favre thoughts?

[Brett Favre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre) is retiring. Unless they were playing against the Steelers I always rooted for the Packers because of him. Why? Montana and Marino were better quarterbacks over their whole career, though I only followed football during the tail of their playing years, but it seemed like Favre’s personality was more amenable to sympathy and identification. Yes, Montana was a 3rd round draft pick, but once he got on the playing field his fluid and cool grace made him seem effortless. Similarly, Marino’s quick release was almost superhuman. Favre seemed to be overpreforming his raw talent base through sheer effort and force of persona; the fact that he played in freezing Green Bay probably added to, or even created, that perception. Montana played in San Francisco and Marion in Miami, where the weather probably dampens any perception of “gritty & gutty” playing-though-pain (OMG, drizzle in 45 degree weather!!!). Anyone know of multiple regression on NLF players? (this is a question aimed at [Steve](https://isteve.blogspot.com/))

(note, I was aware of Favre during his college days, the marginal time of a teenager seems boundless and it allowed for the simultaneous immersion in both Saturday and Sunday sports watching)
