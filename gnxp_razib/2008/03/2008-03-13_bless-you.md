Bless you!

[Scientist calculates an equation for the common cold](http://www.sltrib.com/ci_8551020): **“Ten percent of your life is spent fighting colds.”** Wow. That makes sense though. I’ve read that common cold viruses need at least the population density of agricultural societies to persist endemically. No wonder the recent work on natural selection among humans shows that immune related loci exhibit strong signatures of recent evolution.
