Brown people have no taste in wine

Dave Munger has a [post up about discernment when it comes to wine](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/03/can_anyone_learn_to_taste_wine.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=toplink). The Munger sayeth:

> Researchers have known for some time that not everyone has the same > ability to detect tastes. **Some people — “super-tasters” — are > especially sensitive to a wide range of tastes.** As it turns out, > whether or not you’re a super-taster may come down to your ability to > detect a single molecule: 6-n-propylthiouracil, or PROP for short. > Those who can taste PROP find it incredibly bitter, but super-tasters > are also extra sensitive to saltiness, sweetness, and even tactile > sensations in the mouth.

I’ve posted on the genetics of taste and smell. There’s a lot there. As it happens, it seems that there is some variation in the distribution of supertasters across the world. **South Asians have the lowest frequency in general of supertasters.** Some people have hypothesized that this might be due to an adaptation to spice in food; nontasters have a higher tolerance threshold for many flavors because of their insensitivity. I’m skeptical, but it’s an idea. In any case, I’ve reproduced [some data](https://books.google.com/books?id=TqOMfSJdnQoC&pg=PA102&dq=PTC+prop+hindu&ei=7S7SR4a7B5nmtQPp0oylBQ&sig=OYQ89VnfmhwJCNCb0mKKv199u4E) on taste variation between populations. I’ve also calculated the proportion of supertasters, assuming that this is a homozygous inverse of non-tasters. The data below aggregated tasters and supertasters, but a little algebra and [Hardy-Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy-Weinberg_principle) assumptions can generate the proportion of supertasters.

For the record, I’m a nontaster, and I have a crappy palette.
