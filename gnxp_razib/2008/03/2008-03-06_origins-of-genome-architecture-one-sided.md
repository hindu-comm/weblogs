Origins of Genome Architecture one-sided?

So says a [review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4RXCMF4-5&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=bc1ab9a7c4129efe7f6441209dba1fd7) (thanks [evolgen](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2008/03/charlesworth_on_lynch.php)). I’ve read most of [Origins of Genome Architecture](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/origins-of-genome-architecture.php) and Mike Lynch doesn’t have a “two-handed economist” problem; but I think the style of presentation makes it clear that he’s not being even-handed or fair & balanced.
