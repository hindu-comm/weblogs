Anecdotal culture shift?

A cousin of mine in Bangladesh just had a baby. She’s 34, and this is her first and last child due to various issues with infertility. Obviously she is very happy to have a child, but I’m told she’s a bit disappointed with the sex; you see, it’s a boy. My cousin and her husband wanted a girl since the perception is that women maintain closer relations with their parents as they grow up while boys just disappear (in case it comes up in comments they’re professionals and believing Muslims, though not very intense about practicing).
