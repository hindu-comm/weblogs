Geert Wilders & defaming Islam

Michael C. Moynihan has a article up at *Reason*, [In Defense of Geert Wilders](http://www.reason.com/news/show/125716.html):

> In response to the controversy surrounding Fitna, Wilders’ website was > knocked offline by his American host, Network Solutions; he has been > repeatedly denounced by the government of Jan Peter Balkenende as a > liability to Dutch “interests”; the country’s shriveled monarch, Queen > Beatrix, admonished that free speech doesn’t allow one the right to > offend; **and last week 1000 “anti-racism” activists protested Fitna > in Amsterdam’s city center. As one demonstrator told Reuters, “There > should be restrictions on what Wilders can say… it is a very bad > example to people to let him say whatever he wants.”** Similar > demonstrations on behalf of free speech and the freedom to mock, > insult, and defame religion have yet to materialize.

Ah, too bad here in the United States we aren’t as progressive and liberal as those Europeans. They’re so advanced compared to us. As a racist I luckily enjoy the right to insult Islam on this side of the pond.
