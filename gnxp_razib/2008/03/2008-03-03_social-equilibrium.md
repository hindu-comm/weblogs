Social Equilibrium

My old cyber-friend, “Georg Kantor”, has a new English-language blog (his native language is Spanish): [Social Equilibrium](https://social-equilibrium.blogspot.com/), which might be of interest to GNXP readers. In particular, check out his [demographics tool](http://www.freewebs.com/kantor-web/Readme.html), introduced on [this post](https://social-equilibrium.blogspot.com/2008/03/kantor-demo-tool-and-european-muslim.html), “designed to produce transparent and easy population projections for non-professional users”.
