More on Path Analysis

As a supplement to my [post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/notes-on-sewall-wright-path-analysis.php) on Sewall Wright’s method of Path Analysis, [here](http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol7.1/denis.html) is an article on the subject which I just found. I don’t agree with all the authors’ comments, but the historical background and references are useful.
