The Emperor Gladwell is naked

![The food equivalent of a Malcolm Gladwell book, *credit*, Larry A. Moore](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/09/250px-Hostess_twinkies_tweaked.jpg?resize=250%2C157 "250px-Hostess_twinkies_tweaked")

Several years ago I had an email exchange with Christopher Chabris, the author of [The Invisible Gorilla](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/the-illusions-of-intuition/#.UkZCFYZwqSo). I half-joked that it should have been retitled “Why Malcolm Gladwell Is Wrong.” Chabris replied with a “no comment.” That was probably politic; Chabris is a serious academic, while Gladwell runs a vast pop-social science empire of sorts. But in a [new piece in*The Wall Street Journal* reviewing](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304713704579093090254007968.html) Gladwell’s new book, [David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BAXFAOW/geneexpressio-20), Chabris pretty much goes for it in terms of saying what many academics think privately.

You can get an ungated version if you go [through Google News](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=%27David+and+Goliath%27+by+Malcolm+Gladwell&oq=%27David+and+Goliath%27+by+Malcolm+Gladwell&gs_l=news-cc.3...0.0.0.1168.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1ac.).
