Older fathers and the IQ of their children

From what people tell me IQ is a social construct which is totally controlled by environmental variables, and so is not of much interest. But curiously the other day when I looked at the hits on this website over the past 3+ years a huge number of highly accessed posts had to do with intelligence and IQ. In any case, **seeing as how many readers of this weblog are having, or going to have, children at a relatively advanced age (in an evolutionary sense) I thought this post would be a good public service announcement.** Below is a figure from a preprint posted on [arXiv, The effect of paternal age on offspring intelligence and personality when controlling for paternal trait level](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1309/1309.4625.pdf) (via [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/)):

I’m assuming that there’s initially an upward slope because more intelligent men tend to reproduce later (you can confirm this by looking atAGEKDBRN and WORDSUM variables in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss12)). Once you control for education and IQ the effect disappears. But there isn’t a downward slope, which you might predict if the [hypothesis of increased mutational load](http://www.nature.com/news/fathers-bequeath-more-mutations-as-they-age-1.11247) was valid. IQ is a high polygenic trait with variation controlled likely by thousands of genes, but one would presume that large effect*de novo*variants could change that architecture.

As always, more data is welcome.
