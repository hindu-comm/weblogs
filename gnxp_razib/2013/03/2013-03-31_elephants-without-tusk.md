Elephants without tusks?

It has recently come to my attention that there is wide variation in the frequency of tuskless male elephants across populations. These individuals are termed *maknas*. To review, while both male and female African elephants have tusks, prominent tusks are only a feature of males in Asian elephants. Yet among wild [Sri Lankans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_elephant), which number on the order of \~5,000 individuals, tuskless males are \~90% of the population! Similar population frequencies have been reported in the few Chinese elephants than remain in Yunnan province. Tuskless apparently also [may be a heritable trait](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1995.tb00800.x/abstract) among some African elephant populations. I think you know where I’m going with this. Seeing that China’s demand side [appetite for ivory is resulting in more poaching](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059469), and is unlikely to abate over the next 10 years or so, the heritable variation which results in lack of tusks in elephants may be a possible glimmer of hope. Of course, elephant generations are long, so I’m not offering an adaptive panacea. Just a likely prediction.

**Literature:** [Tuskless bulls in Asian elephant Elephas maximus. History and population genetics of a man-made phenomenon](http://rcin.org.pl/Content/12572/BI002_2613_Cz-40-2_Acta-T40-Suppl3-125-143_o.pdf).

Addendum: I am aware that this does not address habit destruction.
