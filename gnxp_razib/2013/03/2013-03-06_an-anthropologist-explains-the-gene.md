An anthropologist explains the gene!

Over at [Ethnography.com](http://www.ethnography.com/2013/03/gene-promoters-on-chagnon-and-diamond/) a late response to my post [Against the cultural anthropologists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/against-the-cultural-anthropologists/) from someone named [Michael Scroggins](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/michael-scroggins/). He accuses me of being “The **hyperbolic** leader in this round of hippie bashing.” That’s a defensible proposition, but speaking of hyperbole, he says:

> The paradigm that informs Chagnon, Diamond and their chorus of > supporters in the blogosphere is an adherence to the modern synthesis > in evolutionary biology. To be more specific, they are both, more or > less, **sociobiologists who believe in genetic determinism.**

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/03/wil.png?resize=211%2C186 "wil")![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/03/wil.png?resize=211%2C186 "wil")](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/03/wil.png)First, the way cultural anthropologists use the term “genetic determinism” is similar to the way propagandists bandy about the terms “fascism” and “communism.” They’re usually not descriptions of real individuals or movements in the modern age, but point to a reality which connotes a particular odious intellectual flavor worthy of shunning, shaming, and asphyxiating. More precisely, **there are almost no “genetic determinists” as such who adhere to the proposition that genes *determine* in some physics-like manner the specific manifestation of human nature.** Rather, genes matter, just as culture matters.

The accusation of being a genetic determinist is clearly off the mark for Chagnon, and even less of Jared Diamond (who has written [whole books](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/geneexpressio-20) centered upon the premise of biological egalitarianism and the overwhelming power of environmental conditions on the course of human affairs!). Even in the case of Chagnon, a self-identified sociobiologist, the accusation of genetic determinism is a matter of rhetorical flash and slander, the stock and trade of modern cultural anthropology. In [Nobles Savages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006VJN2FE//geneexpressio-20) he recounts that his great antagonist [Marvin Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harris) repeatedly references the lie that Chagnon believed in a “gene for war.” This is a lie because Chagnon repeatedly challenged this characterization, but Harris and his fellow travelers apparently repeated the accusation because of its rhetorical bite even when corrected on the record. This seems plausible because a self-described hippie, [John Horgan](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/02/18/the-weird-irony-at-the-heart-of-the-napoleon-chagnon-affair/), has reported that not only does Chagnon reject the idea of a gene for war, but believes that war is a cultural artifact! (Horgan wrote about his encounter with Chagnon in [The End of War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1936365367/geneexpressio-20)).

And yet the most interesting aspect of the post above is the long rumination on the nature of the gene.

This characterization is problematic, more or less. And though I am more positively disposed toward evolutionary psychology and sociobiology than most, **the bracketing of population genetics into the same class as these to me definitely justifies the label of Left Creationist for Michael Scroggins.**\* Additionally, molecular genetic biology post-dates Mendelism and the early 20th century work in genetics by decades. And the two individuals most famous for the emergence of molecular genetics, James Watson and [Francis Crick](http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/cmt/?p=2282), both exhibited attitudes which Scroggins would define as genetic determinist. This is not “Not Even Wrong.” It is “Not Even Aspiring to be Right.”

In any case, *cultural anthropology delenda est!*

\* Note that I am not conceding Scroggins’ characterization in its basis.
