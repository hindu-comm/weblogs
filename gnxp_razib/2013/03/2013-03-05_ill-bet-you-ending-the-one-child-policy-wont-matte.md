I'll bet you ending the one child policy won't matter

On Twitter Chris Mims expresses the entirely reasonable proposition that China’s low fertility is a prescription for long term socioeconomic disaster (they’re already beyond [“peak worker”](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21570750-first-two-articles-about-impact-chinas-one-child-policy-we-look-shrinking)), with a link to an article in *Quartz*, [China’s ratio of boys to girls is still dangerously high—and it’s the Chinese government’s fault](http://qz.com/59398/chinas-ratio-of-boys-to-girls-is-still-dangerously-high-and-its-the-chinese-governments-fault/). First, I’ve noted before that in East Asian societies where male preference was the norm [this can shift very quickly](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html?pagewanted=all). It happened to South Korea over the past 10 years, and it happened in Japan a generation ago. To my knowledge this was more of a matter of “bottom-up” cultural changes than government policy.

Second, **the one child policy matters less than we think it does.**

  

For what it’s worth, Taiwan’s fertility rate was 1.12 in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Taiwan#Fertility_rate.5B11.5D.5B12.5D). The relative ignorance of these trends in East Asia (i.e., beyond China) among the public is reflective of the reality that in some ways the West is very cultural self-centered. Similarly, most Westerners observing European secularization are totally unaware that [East Asian](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/most-atheists-are-not-white/) societies have long been the most irreligious on the face of the planet (before Communism as well).
