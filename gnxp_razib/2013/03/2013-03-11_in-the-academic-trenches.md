In the academic trenches

An email from a long time correspondent who recounts some graduate school interview experiences:

> Hi, Razib. Last week I attended a 2-day long interview for grad > school, during which I spoke with about 15 faculty, all of whom were > biological anthropologists, though of varying specialities. During > these informal meetings, the topic of bio vs cultural anthropology > came up a few times and a couple of professors spoke very candidly > about the divide that exists between the two disciplines and their > desire to have bio anthropology split from the rest of anthro. A very > common argument was the one you’ve made: that many cultural > anthropologists have become glorified activists. This sort of ran > counter to the attitude I encountered during my undergrad > \[identifying information redacted\] wherein a ‘four field’ approach > was pumped up. I thought this was an interesting little quirk. > Basically, when bio anthropologists are amongst only their own (the > grad program is separate from the 3 other subfields), they speak > openly about the need for separation from cultural anthro because of > the latter’s non-scientific ways, but when some of those same bio > anthropologists are in the same building as their cultural anthro > colleagues, they tout a holistic approach to the field as a whole.

The broader concept of finding [“patterns of culture”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict#Patterns_of_Culture) isn’t worthless. And I’m pretty sure that the biological anthropologists above wouldn’t be ashamed to be on the same faculty as someone like[Joe Heinrich](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/the-unstylized-science-of-human-culture/#.UT6NjBzvuSo), who is asking serious questions with sound and**transparent methods**. Then there is someone like Michael Scroggins, who can write with a straight face that [“in this conception, a gene is more rhetorical topic than scientific fact”](http://www.ethnography.com/2013/03/gene-promoters-on-chagnon-and-diamond/), who makes a [big point](http://www.ethnography.com/2013/03/gene-promoters-2-the-wrath-of-khan/comment-page-1/#comment-9765) of pointing out that I used the term gene in a *singular*. **Are there really people who reduce everything to linguistic analysis?** Why yes! Cato had the [right of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder#On_the_Punic_Wars) in some ways. Perhaps sadder is the fact that Scroggins’ ruminations are [awesomely persuasive to his colleagues](http://theanthrogeek.com/2013/03/08/the-scrogging-of-khan-putting-genetics-in-their-place/). I’ll leave you a typical example of “Scrogging”:

> Gould poses two philosophical problems for population genetics that a > narrow reading of Mismeasure of Man fails to capture. >
> First, Punctuated Equilibrium posits that stasis is the default state > of change in evolution. That is, change mainly happens in great bursts > which create immense morphological variation (speciation) for a short > period of time. Following this things settle into a long period of > stasis. There may be some variation in phylogenetic change, but it has > no real physical or functional importance – though we all know it has > tremendous social importance. This is well supported in the fossil > record. >
> Obviously this is a great difficulty for any field which posits > gradual phylogenetic change as the main mechanism of evolution, and > then seeks to rank groups accordingly. >
> The second challenge Gould poses is simpler. Where in population > genetics (particularly historical population genetics) is the theory > of development? >
> What it has is a variation of recapitulation theory. Embryonic members > of a given population are assumed to develop unproblematically into > adult members of that population. >
> How do you move from the gene (pick a definition) or some sub-part of > the gene to the development of an individual within a social milieu? > From the unit of analysis taken by population genetics (some part of a > gene) you simply cannot make assertions about complex phenomena like > the display of “IQ.” Though that has never stopped some of them from > trying….

Needless to say I am not particularly persuaded by confused garblings of [Stephen Jay Gould’s](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1999/12/13/1999_12_13_056_TNY_LIBRY_000019761) ideas….
