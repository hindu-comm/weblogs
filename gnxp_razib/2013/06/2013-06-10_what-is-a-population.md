What is a population?

Anyone who reads the genomic posts with any interest on his weblog***must***read [Daniel Lawson’s](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/) fine review of the topic which he has posted on arXiv, [Populations in statistical genetic modelling and inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0701) (via [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/2013/06/05/populations-in-statistical-genetic-modelling-and-inference/)). Even if you don’t have a population genetic and genomic background **the gist is entirely accessible.** If you do have a population genetic and genomic background and haven’t used various packages such as STRUCTURE or EIGENSOFT yourself, I would recommend reading Lawson’s characterizations, as they are all spot on.

Also, if you have not, I recommend Lawson’s website for [ChromoPainter and fineSTRUCTURE](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/finestructure/index.html). The utility of these methods is outlined in the paper [Inference of Population Structure using Dense Haplotype Data](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002453).
