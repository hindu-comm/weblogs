The four Da Bomb hot sauces

![300,000 Scoville units](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/06/2013-06-13_10-34-46_356.jpg?resize=250%2C333 "Da Bomb Ground Zero")

Recently I tried four of the[Da Bomb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=Da%20Bomb&linkCode=ur2&tag=geneexpressio-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1)

hot sauces. I was prompted by [a story](http://www.latimes.com/features/food/dailydish/la-dd-kid-spikes-cafeteria-marinara-hot-sauce-20130607,0,7145101.story) in *The Los Angeles Times* about a student who got in serious trouble for putting [Da Bomb: The Final Answer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BIXK7K/geneexpressio-20) into the marinara at a cafeteria. Coming in a \>1 million Scoville units I can see why this is a serious offense. But [Da Bomb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=Da%20Bomb&linkCode=ur2&tag=geneexpressio-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1)

features other lines as well. Here are the four I tried out recently with some friends:

– [Da Bomb Ghost Pepper](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0037V0N74/geneexpressio-20). This is a relatively mild sauce, and is more notable to me for its saltiness than anything else. The label says \~30,000 Scoville units, and that seems about right.

– [Da Bomb Beyond Insanity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FIBBWS/geneexpressio-20). At 100,000 Scoville units it’s taking it to the next level. I can’t really say there’s much distinctive for me about this sauce. It sufficed in terms of the spice, but it wasn’t exceptional in either that or flavor.

  
– [Da Bomb Ground Zero](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DG56P/geneexpressio-20). Definitely not the least. At 300,000 Scoville units this will test a hardened pepper hound, but, it’s not physically dangerous. The taste isn’t as artificial and metallic to me as the [Dave’s Insanity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DID5R/geneexpressio-20) line. This is the closest in terms of utils to fresh habanero.

– Finally, [Da Bomb: The Final Answer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BIXK7K/geneexpressio-20). I enjoyed this…but **this sauce is a serious hazard.** To be safe and comfortable you should handle it with disposable gloves, and store it somewhere that the unsuspecting won’t be able to stumble upon. In the end I have to go with [Ground Zero](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DG56P/geneexpressio-20) because it’s not a pain in the ass. [The Final Answer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BIXK7K/geneexpressio-20) is really just a “stunt sauce’ in terms of usage as a condiment. Of course it would still be useful for cooking, but then I have to ask why you just don’t go with a pure capsaicin extract of some sort.
