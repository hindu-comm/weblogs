Do liberals oppose genetically modified organisms more than conservatives?

![**Credit:** Puma](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/06/120px-Cherry_tomatoes.jpg?resize=120%2C87 "120px-Cherry_tomatoes")

There has been recent talk about GMOs and political orientation recently. [Keith Kloor](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/#.UbasG_m1GSo) has pointers to the appropriate places. **The general impression on all sides seems to be that elite voices against genetically modified organisms are on the Left.** To my knowledge this is correct, especially in the United States. But is this true more broadly? We can use the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss12)to explore this further. It has a series of questions relating to genetically modified organisms. All except one were asked in 2006 (the exception was 2010).

For replication here are the variables:

**Row:** EATGM POLINFGM BIZINFGM MEDAGRGM MEDINFGM GMMED GMPOL GMBIZ POLINFNK

**Column:** POLVIEWS(r:1-3″Liberal”;4″Moderate”;5-7″Conservative”)

There results are presented below (rows add up to 100% for each question).

What this tells us is that elite opinions matter a lot in public discourse. The gap between liberals and non-liberals is not really there on this issue at the grassroots. That could change, as people of various ideologies tend to follow elite cues. This is why the strong counter-attack from within the Left elite is probably going to be effective, as it signals that being against GMO is not the “liberal position.”

**Addendum:** Just so people who haven’t been reading me know, political moderates tend [not to be very intelligent](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/02/moderates-are-dull-liberals-are-smarter-conservatives-are-middling/).
