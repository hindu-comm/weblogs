Around the net, & of note

As some of you may have noticed, [Neuroskeptic](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/#.URtFMqUqaSo) has joined *Discover*. I am rather pleased. There will be others soon enough.

[Chris Chabris](http://blog.chabris.com/) has a blog. I reviewed his [book *The Invisible Gorilla*](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/the-illusions-of-intuition/#.URtFmaUqaSo) a few years back. Here’s one thing I would say about Chabris: **I read him very closely, because he is very careful.** And I’ve been doing so since the late 1990s, when I first [encountered](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/iq-since-the-bell-curve/) his writing.

  
[Ruling Islamists, Under Attack, Reject Blame for Tunisia’s Woes](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/africa/memo-from-tunis-ennahda-party-rejects-blame-for-tunisias-troubles.html). Tunisia was, in my pinion, the Arab Spring’s first best hope.

[Paper: Men and Women Are From Earth: Examining the Latent Structure of Gender](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=3667). Most people who believe that there are differences between groups, who are not totally stupid, don’t conjecture that they are categorical and dichotomous classes. Men are taller than women in a pragmatic sense does no entail that *all* men are taller than women.

[DIY biotech spreads to community](http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jan/26/do-it-yourself-biotech-spread/). In many ways I think “DIY” is going to become a buzzword with less meaning in the near future. With the proliferation of information appliances we’ll do lots of things ourselves, bu we won’t be amateur about it.

[Fears of the Future Haunt a Budding Generation of Afghan Strivers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/middle-class-afghans-face-a-murky-future.html). American economic stimulus driven by taxation causes prosperity somewhere.

[Isotopic data show farming arrived in Europe with migrants](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/uow-ids020813.php). We need to be careful of projecting two exclusionary models.

[Inside China’s Genome Factory](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/511051/inside-chinas-genome-factory/). BGI may have great publicists, but I suspect to a large extent they are the real deal.

[Honey Boo Boo’s Mom is Actually Doing Something Smart with Her Reality Show Money](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/08/honey-boo-boos-mom-is-actually-doing-something-smart-with-her-reality-show-money/?iid=obinsite).

[Zen Groups Distressed by Accusations Against Teacher](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html). One of the most annoying thing about sincere and zealous “spiritual seekers” and they often end up worshiping “teachers” in a cult-like manner. Call me an old fashioned Whig, but true wisdom isn’t found in ancient books or over confident charlatans.

[The Dice Are Rolling on Dell’s Legacy](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/your-money/at-dell-a-gamble-on-a-legacy.html?partner=rss&emc=rss). There are no eternal winners in capitalism.

[God Made A Factory Farmer](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/e1abab3c2b/god-made-a-factory-farmer?playlist=featured_videos).

[When E-Mail Turns From Delight to Deluge](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/technology/when-e-mail-turns-from-delight-to-deluge.html?partner=rss&emc=rss). Facebook has siphoned off a lot of the inter-personal email.

[Michael Bloomberg, Tireless Champion of Civil Liberties. Yes. You read that right.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/michael-bloomberg-tireless-champion-of-civil-liberties/273027/)

[Why Are There So Few Vegetarians?](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201109/why-are-there-so-few-vegetarians) I found out about these stats a few years ago.

[uBiome](http://www.indiegogo.com/ubiome). I think I’m in.
