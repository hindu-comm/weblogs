The abuse of ancestry testing is bad for personal genomics

I have very little with which I can disagree with in this Mark Thomas piece, [To claim someone has ‘Viking ancestors’ is no better than astrology](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/feb/25/viking-ancestors-astrology). His conclusion:

> Exaggerated claims from the consumer ancestry industry can also > undermine the results of serious research about human genetic history, > which is cautiously and slowly building up a clearer picture of the > human past for all of us. >
> Many of the commercial companies plant stories in the media that sound > exciting and seem scientific. But very often they are trivial or > wrong, are not published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and > just serve as disguised PR for the company.

The only caveat I would offer is that the sort of confusions and misrepresentations that occur with Y and mtDNA phylogeography are dampened when you are looking at a million markers throughout the whole genome. This does not mean there are still no confusions and misrepresentations (e.g., the reference populations matter a great deal when you present someone as a linear combination of X populations, and that summary is still not reality as such, but an informative model). One alarming aspect of the trade in Y and mtDNA is that I’ve met several people who somehow believe that **only** these lineages are ancestrally informative. That is probably a function of the ease with which you can say someone is “descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages.”

**Addendum:** I actually asked Jim Wilson on Twitter if I could get a look at the raw results (not even raw data) for the claims made. One major problem when scientists have a go-to-media-first strategy is that things get out of hand very quickly.
