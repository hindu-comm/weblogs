Imagine a world without drift

[Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/2013/02/06/genetic-draft-selective-interference-and-population-genetics-of-rapid-adaptation/) points me to a new pre-print, [Genetic draft, selective interference, and population genetics of rapid adaptation](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1148v1.pdf). Though mathematical, it’s eminently readable, and I commend it to anyone who has a passing interest in evolutionary genetics. As I am still digesting it I won’t say much more, aside from the fact that it seems to imply the proposition that **neutral models of genetic variation and history may not suffice in many cases as a map of reality.** This is important because these neutral models are often the null background against which one tests other alternative hypotheses.

For more background, see my old post on [“genetic draft”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/01/genetic-draft-selection-is-stochastic-sometimes/#.URP00qXC2So). Also, the author has made available [scripts](http://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/interference/) to explore some of the models.
