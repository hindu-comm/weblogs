Words rule life (?)

As an aside in a fascinating *City Journal* piece on educational policy, [A Wealth of Words](http://www.city-journal.org/2013/23_1_vocabulary.html):

> Vocabulary doesn’t just help children do well on verbal exams. Studies > have solidly established the correlation between vocabulary and > real-world ability. Many of these studies examine the Armed Forces > Qualification Test (AFQT), which the military devised in 1950 as an > entrance requirement and a job-allocating device.

Are we surprised that high verbals can talk themselves into more generous remuneration? But in any case the power of vocabulary is why I [believe that the GSS and IQ correlation](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/#.UQEcI1QR-So) is probably robust. And speaking of vocabulary, the author alludes to the now well known phenomenon that children from low socioeconomic status backgrounds tend have a much smaller vocabulary than than those from higher socioeconomic status backgrounds, and how that leads to a positive feedback loop that determines life trajectory. The main confound that comes to mind is that those from low vocab households are probably also from less intelligent households, and [intelligence is heritable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ). But, proactive social engineering probably can break apart the [gene-environment correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-environment_correlation) at least, and dampen the variance in phenotypic outcomes.

And this is where the policy prescriptions may not be to anyone’s liking. On the one hand this social engineering *is* social engineering, and probably will cost money. Conservatives will not like that. But, I also suspect that much of the positive value of a non-home environment is going to be abolished as the child matures and begins to self-select peer groups from their own socioeconomic milieu. In other words you need to attack the milieu, the culture of poverty and anti-intellectualism. And I suspect many liberals will not be comfortable with the aggressive paternalism that that implies. So nothing will get done.

**Addendum:** Again, the best thing you can do to have smart well behaved children is to select a spouse with those characteristics.
