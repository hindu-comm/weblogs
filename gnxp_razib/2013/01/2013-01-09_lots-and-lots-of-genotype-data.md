Lots and lots of genotype data!

The Estonian Biocentre has put up [lots of data](http://evolutsioon.ebc.ee/MAIT/public_data/index.html) in Plink pedigree format. Format is important because now many of you can [manipulate these](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/01/using-your-23andme-data-how-inbred-are-you/) data. This the source of some of the data in PHYLO, so I need to double check the IDs or rebuild the data set (though for basic exploration I think PHYLO is still sufficient). This data set, [combined with my ADMIXTURE tutorial](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/analyzing-ancestry-with-admixture-step-by-step/#.UO20mVQR-Sp) should give everyone the tools to replicate results of the sort of papers which were cutting edge from 2006-2010 (i.e., model-based clustering with bar plots + PCA/MDS visualization).

Props to Mait Metspalu and company for release these data.
