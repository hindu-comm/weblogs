The human genetic casserole

[![Hotdish](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/10/Hotdish-300x213.jpg?resize=300%2C213)![Hotdish](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/10/Hotdish-300x213.jpg?resize=300%2C213)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/10/Hotdish.jpg)I haven’t said much about [this article in *Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6157/409.full), [Ancient DNA Links Native Americans With Europe](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6157/409.full), because it would be an understatement to say I’m digesting it. I would offer up a caution that using **terms like “Europeans” and “East Asians” for populations which flourished \~25,000 years ago might be misleading.** We are used to thinking of genetic distance in terms of space, but time is also a dimension to consider. Populations even without admixture or gene flow will have drifted in allele frequencies over so many generations.

But I have to admit that it seems more and more likely that **most extant modern populations are combinations of lineages which diverged *very early* after the “Out of Africa” migration.** We see this clearly with South Asians, and now Europeans and Native Americans. The Reich lab has also found evidence of admixture in [in Australians](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(11)00395-8). The closer we look, the more amalgamation we see between disparate lineages. Using the elements of the present to reconstruct the patterns of the past is going to be a more daunting task than most would have guessed.
