bioRxiv is here

[![bioRxiv](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/bioRxiv.png?resize=509%2C203)![bioRxiv](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/bioRxiv.png?resize=509%2C203)](http://biorxiv.org/)For years many in the biological sciences community have been jealous of the exist of [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv). This preprint server allows researchers to distribute their work widely to all comers. On occasion when when there have been debates about mimicking arXiv for biology there has been skepticism about the nature of the outcomes (my own rejoinder is that fields where a preprint culture is the norm, such as economics and physics, don’t seem to be doing badly). Now we’ll see if the end is nigh in biological science due to preprints; [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/) is live (sponsored by [CSHL](http://www.cshl.edu/)). The first paper, [The Population Genetic Signature of Polygenic Local Adaptation](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/11/07/000026). There’s not much up yet, but there will be.
