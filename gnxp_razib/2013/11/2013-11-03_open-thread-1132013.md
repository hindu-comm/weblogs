[![Origins-of-the-Irish1](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/Origins-of-the-Irish1.jpg?resize=120%2C178)![Origins-of-the-Irish1](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/Origins-of-the-Irish1.jpg?resize=120%2C178)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BM9OD60/geneexpressio-20)After reading [Ancestral Journeys](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ET8B6Q6/geneexpressio-20), I decided to get J. P. Mallory’s [The Origins of the Irish](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BM9OD60/geneexpressio-20). A bit on the academic side for some, but definitely a good dive into the literature. Mallory is well aware of the latest genetic research, so this is as up-to-date as it gets. It’s a good case study in how multidisciplinary prehistoric studies should be done.

As I’ve suggested earlier prehistory looks to be a good deal more complex than we had previous thought, so expanding beyond single methodological perspectives is probably essential if we really care about truth.

In other news, a short piece in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/middleeast/yemen.html?ref=international-home&pagewanted=print) refers to Salafis as ‘ultraconservative.’ I think this misleads most people about the nature of Salafism: it is a radical utopian *system* which recently arose out of Islam’s confrontation with Western derived modernity. It isn’t conserving anything. This aspect of Salafism explains why [Saudi Arabia condones the bulldozing of Muhammed’s tomb](https://rt.com/news/saudi-arabia-prophet-mosque-615/) and celebrates modern [monumental architecture](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/23/mecca-architecture-hajj1) in Islam’s holy city.
