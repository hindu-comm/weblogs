Endings & beginnings

Until further notice this is my last post as a blogger at *Discover Magazine*. This shouldn’t impact regular readers. As always you can follow me by going to:

My feed, <http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed>

My Twitter, <https://twitter.com/razibkhan>

And of course, my website, [http://www.razib.com](http://www.razib.com/)

From December 1st, 2013, I will be blogging at [Ron Unz’s](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/us/conservative-leads-effort-to-raise-minimum-wage-in-california.html?_r=0) new website, [The Unz Review](http://www.unz.com/), at a familar subdomain **[http://www.unz.com/gnxp](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/) (feed, [http://www.unz.com/rkhan/feed](http://www.unz.com/rkhan/feed/))**.

I’m excited to explore this new opportunity. Ron is still nailing down the details of look, style, and functionality, so expect some changes on my *Gene Expression*sub-site. To make a long story short Ron wanted to beef up his science coverage, and I was amenable. At least when it comes to my particular bailiwick. Ron has merged my archives from the old *[Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/)* website with the content generated at *ScienceBlogs* and *Discover*, so no matter where I go, or if I stop blogging due to other obligations, those archives will remain as a coherent whole.

**I want to emphasize that my time at *Discover* was incredible.** I want to give special thanks to [Tasha Eichenseher](https://twitter.com/waterlogging), [Amos Zeeberg](https://twitter.com/settostun), and [Sheril Kirshenbaum](https://twitter.com/sheril_). As it happens none of these individuals are associated with *Discover* at this point (Tasha is leaving as well), but they were instrumental in allowing me to either be here (in Sheril’s case) or focus on writing (in Tasha and Amos’ case). I assume you’ll be somewhat surprised that I mention Sheril, but I feel like I have to give special thanks to her because I’m 99% sure that it was her “good word” which allowed me to catch the eye of an outfit as respectable as *Discover*. Unlike a blogger as writerly as [Ed Yong](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/not-exactly-rocket-science/), or Sheril herself, I’ve always been more data nerd-*cum*-verbal pugilist. So this leads me to praise the great management skills of the two web editors I’ve had while being a blogger at *Discover*. They’ve let “Razib be Razib,” by and large letting me do my thing (though yes, in the interests of professionalism I’ve moved most of the more “direct” verbal volleys to Twitter). I really can’t thank anyone else at *Discover* because I barely knew they existed, **which, [in light of recent events](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/2013/10/12/standing-with-dnlee-and-discovering-science/), seems like a good thing.** Overall I give*Discover*a good grade in terms of understanding how blogging should be run, with a light hand. This, despite the fact that I often put up posts which rubbed many “right-thinking-people” the wrong way, and scoured the comment threads acidly.

There’s really not much else to say. Aside from a new domain, don’t expect many changes.
