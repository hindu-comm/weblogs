From the other 95% on the AHA's embargo policy

**Update:** Also see, [Pimpin’ the ghetto](http://www.tdaxp.com/archive/2013/07/25/pimpin-the-ghetto.html):

> **Pimps**who run what little economy exists in the ghetto. They > control the humanities ghetto, have old boys patronage networks to > fall back on, and have a great deal in a slummy part of town. In other > words, folks who get tenure-track PhDs at research universities. >
> The American Historical Association is run by pimps for pimps — by > professors at research universities, for professors at research > universities. That their policy does not help the public or most PhD > graduates of history programs is besides the point. They are an old > boys network protecting themselves. >
> The AHA isn’t out ot protect**disaster tourists**, or**losers**, > or**escapees**. The AHA is by, for, and of pimps. >
> This isn’t too criticize pimps — if you actually love the ghetto, why > not be successful in it? — but to say that not everything they do is > in*your*best interests. >
> If you are in the AHA, here is your choice: You can like that, or you > can get out.

To extend the analogy, **do pimps facilitate good healthy sex for society, or do they encourage the spread of unpalatable contagion by perpetuating the ghetto and its conditions?** You know where I stand….

**End Update**

In relation to the [AHA’s bizarre embargo policy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/07/the-american-historical-association-seems-nuts-to-me) [Patrick Wyman](https://twitter.com/Patrick_Wyman) left a long comment which I think is worth promoting up. Observe that some of the same could be applied to the natural sciences (recall the [Carl Sagan fiasco](http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/popular-and-pilloried/)). So here you have it….

> I’m a historian close to completing my dissertation, and this is > pretty indicative of the general state of affairs in the discipline. > Academic history, as a profession, has essentially abdicated any > responsibility in educating the broader public about its research. > There’s a reason most popular history is written by journalists and > not professional historians: there’s absolutely zero positive > incentive for historians to write for a broader audience, and in fact > it’s actively discouraged by everyone from department chairs to AHA > directors to academic publishers to advisors gleefully shooting down > PhD students who had eventually hoped to do so. >
> This is despite the voracious appetite of the reading public for > historical fare. People want to know about the past, and if historians > aren’t interested in providing it, they’ll read whatever’s available > without evaluating the source. The end result is that professional > historians have made themselves irrelevant in the public sphere. > What’s really shocking about the whole thing is that most historians > treat this as a net positive: now, you see, they can really focus on > their research without wasting time catering to people who can’t speak > the specialized cant of the discipline. >
> Most dissertations don’t become books, and more importantly, most > recipients of doctorates in history (anywhere from 85-95 percent) > never even sniff the tenure-track job for which a tenure book is > necessary. This statement is basically a paean to a time when the AHA > could more effectively pretend (or if you want to be charitable, fool > itself) into thinking that there’s really a future in academia for > most of those who complete dissertations. It’s a cruel irony that the > historians whom this policy hurts the most – everyone other than the > students of the best-known historians at the top 5-10 institutions, > who are massive favorites to get jobs anyway – would actually benefit > professionally from the exposure that open dissertation access > provides. If this policy becomes the norm, the vast majority of the > research that’s conducted will never see the light of the day.
