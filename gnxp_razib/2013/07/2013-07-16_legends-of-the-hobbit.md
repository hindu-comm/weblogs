Legends of ‘the Hobbit’

![**Credit:** [Ryan Somma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Homo_floresiensis.jpg)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/07/220px-Homo_floresiensis.jpg?resize=220%2C245 "220px-Homo_floresiensis")

Like many people I’ve been following the tales of the Hobbits of Flores, [H. floresiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis), with some interest since 2004. And, **like most people I have no personal expertise or skill which is relevant to evaluating whether this putative hominin species actually is a new species** (as opposed to a pathological modern human). So how are we to evaluate a new [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069119) article which comes down on the side that it *is* a new species? First, my very vague impression is that over the past \~10 years the new-species camp has been gaining ground on the pathological-modern-human set. But setting all that aside perhaps the critical issue for me is that the likely reality of archaic human admixture into our own lineage means that **the world is far stranger than we had thought in 2004**. For various anatomical and paleoanthropological reasons *H. floresiensis*was implausible. But as implausible as the idea that the genome of a Siberian hominin would yield admixture in modern Papuans?

**Addendum:** [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/science/hobbits-size-not-likely-linked-to-growth-disorders.html) on the paper in PLOS ONE.
