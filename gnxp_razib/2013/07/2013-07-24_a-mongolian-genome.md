A Mongolian genome?

![**Citation:** Xing J, Wuren T, Simonson TS, Watkins WS, Witherspoon DJ, et al. (2013) Genomic Analysis of Natural Selection and Phenotypic Variation in High-Altitude Mongolians. PLoS Genet 9(7): e1003634. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003634](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/07/mongolian.jpg?resize=500%2C570 "mongolian")

Well, not quite. You have to read the paper, [Genomic Analysis of Natural Selection and Phenotypic Variation in High-Altitude Mongolians](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003634?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosgenetics%2FNewArticles+%28PLOS+Genetics+-+New+Articles%29), to see why I’m skeptical. Frankly it doesn’t seem like they found too much of note in their results, so I’m kind of confused why this paper got into *PLOS GENETICS* (and to give due credit, this group has [published very interesting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2675970/) work in the past which I have smiled upon). So why am I even posting about this paper? **Because I was pretty sure they’d release their data**, [and they have](http://jorde-lab.genetics.utah.edu/?page_id=23) (just page down to the bottom). All researchers who take the trouble to do this should be praised, highlighted, and respected. This improves science. After the [AHA fiasco](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/07/the-american-historical-association-seems-nuts-to-me/#.Ue938Y1wrSg) I’m going to redouble the effort to put the spotlight on those who release their data.

**Addendum:** It must be noted that a “Mongolian” identity is very much an outcome of Genghis Khan’s rise and paramountcy. The Mongols were just one of numerous tribes across what is today Mongolia. With the rise of the *Mongol* Empire many populations, including Turkic populations who were not part of a dialect continuum in close proximity to the Mongols, were assimilated into that ethnic identity with a few generations. The “Zulu” identity is similar, as it is a function of the rise to prominence of Shaka’s particular clan.
