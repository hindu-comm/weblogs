I haven’t been able to blog much because of various other responsibilities, but I definitely do feel pent up posting energy. So when I come back I assume that I’ll have a lot of stuff to say. Meanwhile I’m chortling a bit about this [bizarre attack](http://www.ethnography.com/2013/05/the-political-economy-of-iq-or-tilting-at-windmills-with-steve-hsu-and-jason-richwine/) on my friend [Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/). Here’s the issue that I always have with this: Steve managed to [get tenure as a theoretical physicist](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/09/survivor-theoretical-physics.html). When you’re talking to someone who is an academic theoretical physicist it is generally optimal to not assume *a priori* that they’re ignorant dullards. Unless that is you want to just engage in empty signalling [rhetoric](http://www.ethnography.com/2013/03/gene-promoters-on-chagnon-and-diamond/).

Though despite not having concerted time to write, I am [tweeting a lot](https://twitter.com/razibkhan)since that requires only minimal lengths of attention. Mostly it’s just repeating the functionality of my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:gnxp), though I do comment and what not.

Finally, I keep hearing that the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality typology is much more scientific than Myers Briggs. So I took a bunch of tests which purport to analyze the Big Five categories.

Extraverted: **Very high**. Consistent. I was 90-99% on all tests.  
Agreeableness: **Low**. Consistent. Generally in the 15-0% range.  
Openness: **Medium**. This was not very consistent. 40-60% range.  
Neuroticism: **Erratic**. For whatever reason I varied from 20-80% here.  
Conscientiousness: **Medium**. But there was some variation.

Oh, and here’s a list of books I’ve rated for [Good Reads](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18982209-razib-khan-khan?shelf=read).
