The spice, it burns (a bit)

A few days ago I came across this [four year old](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120191360681137059.html) article in *The Wall Street Journal* on the [Naga Bhut Jolokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_Bhut_Jolokia) “ghost” pepper, which is reportedly hotter than Habanero. Since none of the local grocers carry the ghost pepper, I went online. I purchased some seeds. But I also ordered [Dave’s Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001PQTYN2/geneexpressio-20) and [Volcano Dust Bhut Jolokia Powder](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004C9PTCE//geneexpressio-20). The latter was spicy, but it actually wasn’t too potent. I’d expected a lot more. Think cayenne powder on steroids. On the other hand, the hot sauce *was* hot. And unlike [Dave’s Insanity Sauce](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/03/day-1-of-hot-sauce-daves-insanity-hot-sauce/#.UWZzIZPvuSo) there were flavors besides the heat which one could discern. Unlike Dave’s Insanity the Dave’s Ghost Pepper **doesn’t taste like it came out of a chemical plant.** I heartily recommend it.
