Ancient Ainu mariners!

Well, not really. But a [new paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003460#close) in *PLOS GENETICS* has a really weird speculation nested into the discussion of what seems a relatively banal paper on the phylogeography of South Americans. It’s a Y chromosomal survey of the populations of the New World, so it’s tracing the male lineage only. Because Amerindian populations likely went through at least one (more if you accept multiple [migrations](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/334612/description/Humans_reached_Asia_in_two_waves)) bottleneck the variation on the Y chromosome is low. Ideally you’d be looking at tens of thousands of markers on the autosome, the non-sex inherited genome. But this group had a **very good population coverage.** Over 1,000 men from 50 tribal populations, with a focus on South America. Additionally, non-recombining markers are more manageable in terms of reconstructing demographic histories.

Here’s the frankly bizarre inference (it *may still be right*, but it’s still bizarre):

*In view of the above, two scenarios for the introduction of C3\* into Ecuador seem credible: (i) one or more late migratory waves that quickly passed North and Central America without leaving a trace of C3\*, and (ii) long-distance contact with East Asia. As regards the second scenario, there appears to be at least some…**In particular, the similarity of ceramic artifacts found in both regions led to the hypothesis of a trans-Pacific connection between the middle Jōmon culture of Kyushu (Japan) and the littoral Valdivia culture in Ecuador at 4400–3300 BC.** In view of the close proximity of the spotty C3\* cluster to the Valdivia site, which was considered at the time to represent the earliest pottery in the New World \[40\], it may well be that C3\* was introduced into the northwest of South America from East Asia by sea, either along the American west coast or across the Pacific (with some help by major currents).* Please note that they modeled the last common ancestors of the East Asian and South American C3\* lineages, and it looks to be \~6,000 years before the present. But if I’m reading the results table right the intervals could push it as far as \~10,000 years before the present.

To me this looks like the Indian-admixture-into-Australians [paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/01/the-voyage-of-krishna-crusoe/). Suggestive, but so strange that we should wait until our prior expectations are obviously wrong. Unfortunately I don’t see the raw data in the links, though perhaps if someone could find them they could post that in the comments. I would be curious to replicate the results at some point.
