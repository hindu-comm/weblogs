The Yamnaya probably did ride horses…

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/horsewheel.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/horsewheel.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07H38F3KM/geneexpressio-20)One of the major weak points of [The Horse the Wheel and Language](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07H38F3KM/geneexpressio-20) is that there isn’t good evidence for horsemanship during the period of Yamnaya expansion. More recently, the genetic evidence seems pretty clear that [modern horses descend from Sintashta](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04018-9) populations after 2000 BC. Nevertheless, it’s pretty weird how fast the pastoralist Yamnaya moved. I suspect that a more primitive form of horse utilization was the norm for the Yamnaya. They didn’t have cavalry, but they may have ridden ponies to get to a location or escape the site of a raid.

A new paper looking at human skeletons does indicate such horse-riding, [First bioanthropological evidence for Yamnaya horsemanship](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2451?adobe_mc=MCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1678214704#sec-2):

> The origins of horseback riding remain elusive. Scientific studies > show that horses were kept for their milk ~3500 to 3000 BCE, widely > accepted as indicating domestication. However, this does not confirm > them to be ridden. Equipment used by early riders is rarely preserved, > and the reliability of equine dental and mandibular pathologies > remains contested.
