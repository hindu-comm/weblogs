LaTeX notes

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/9867_Latex-cov.jpg?resize=300%2C374)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/9867_Latex-cov.jpg?resize=300%2C374)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0073FTN5I/geneexpressio-20)I recently installed a plugin that will allow me to render [LaTeX](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0073FTN5I/geneexpressio-20). Mostly this is because I’ve long avoided writing out equations because it’s awkward in HTML, and it gets unintelligible quickly. This will allow me to explore population genetics in its “natural language” a little easier.

But I just noticed on my RSS feed view the LaTeX is not rendering for whatever reason. Where there should be equations or LaTeX rendered text there is a blank space. This is unfortunate, but I don’t know what to do about it. So just click through if you want the equations. If you are willing to “hum through” those portions it shouldn’t matter. The equations aren’t going to take up much of any post.

Also, [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) is a god. Probably he’ll think that’s blasphemous because he’s a Lutheran and all, but [The Art of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321751043/geneexpressio-20) beats the Bible in my book!
