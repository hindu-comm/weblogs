What should I blog about in the next two weeks?

Any thoughts/suggestions? Only thing off limits would be anything too personal. I already [asked](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/849384219235233793) on Twitter and got some [responses](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/849384219235233793) so no need to be redundant unless you want to add to the weight of a preference.

Also, now that I finished [Reformations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01G5SM2OM/geneexpressio-20)\* I’m finally reading Nick Bostrom’s [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00LOOCGB2/geneexpressio-20) front to back. But I have a lot of other Kindle books in the “stack”, and aside from those I’m going to tackle for personal/professional development (e.g., stuff on machine learning or Bayesian statistics) I have some latitude and am toying with listing books and giving readers some input in the arrangement/sequence.

\* I’ll review the book at some point, but main quibble is that it was too heavy on ideas/theology, even though by the end the author admitted one should be cautious about focusing on this aspect.
