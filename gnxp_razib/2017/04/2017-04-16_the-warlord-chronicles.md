The Warlord Chronicles

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TheWinterKing.jpg?resize=220%2C336)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TheWinterKing.jpg?resize=220%2C336)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015CLB7KI/geneexpressio-20)The [Winter is Coming](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/04/15/small-council-books-read-wait-winds-winter/) website has a post up, [What books should you read as you wait for The Winds of Winter?](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/04/15/small-council-books-read-wait-winds-winter/) (*The Winds of Winter* is the next [Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20) book).

I don’t have much time for fiction at this point, but the first entry that they suggested was [Bernard Cornwell’s](https://www.amazon.com/Bernard-Cornwell/e/B000APAB68/&tag=geneexpressio-20) [Warlord Chronicles](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015CLB7KI/geneexpressio-20). This is a very dark, gritty, and realistic, retelling of the Arthurian legend, written in a fashion more reminiscent of historical fiction than fantasy. I read this series perhaps a year after first reading [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20), and was struck by similarities of tone.

As it happened this was before George R. R. Martin was quite as famous, and I emailed him at some point in 2000 about various issues relating to his works and inspirations, and asked him about Cornwell’s series. Martin admitted that he was a huge fan, and appreciated that there were similarities of style and tone.

In any case, I second this recommendation. [Warlord Chronicles](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015CLB7KI/geneexpressio-20) is not the most easy read…but worth it.
