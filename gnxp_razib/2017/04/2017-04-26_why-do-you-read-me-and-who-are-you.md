Why do you read me and who are you

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/45747.jpg?resize=267%2C400)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/45747.jpg?resize=267%2C400)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20)The first time I tried to get through Scott Atran’s[In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20), I gave up because it seemed so pretentious and impenetrable. My curiosity was piqued by the fact that the subtitle alluded to evolution, and I was interested in evolutionary psychology. But though [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20) does talk somewhat about the evolutionary origins of religion, **fundamentally it’s a work of cognitive anthropology.**

Because I did not know about this field, its lexicon struck me as totally opaque, and there seemed something almost Post-Modern and French about Atran’s prose. Actually though this perception made some sense, Atran, Dan Sperber, Pascal Boyer, and Larry Hirschfeld actually came up with the naturalistic paradigm in anthropology while meeting at Sperber’s home in Paris in the early 1980s.

I did end up reading[In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20) front to back a year after I initially tackled it, along with some other books on religion from this perspective (e.g., [Religion Explained](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465006965/geneexpressio-20) by Pascal Boyer). Up until 2007 or so I would write extensively on cognitive anthropology and religion, but I got what I wanted to in terms of insight after period and do not write much on this topic (in 2006 I actually got invited to a conference with a press pass on the topic of religion and evolution, my interests had become so well known in this domain).

So I was surprised to see this [comment](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/04/25/dost-thou-know-the-equilibrium-at-panmixia/#comment-905):

> I’ll give it a go. I tried starting with Principles of Population > Genetics but found it heavy going (**Ive only been reading here for a > few years and mainly got into it for the posts about religion**, but > the genetics stuff is quite interesting)

I suppose I still write about religion enough that that might hook some people. Though honestly I don’t have anything original to say…it’s just that much of mainstream commentary strikes me as totally dumb and uninformed.

But that prompts me. Consider this an “unlurk” thread. Two questions:

1\) Why do you read me? (and implicitly, what should I write about more?)

2\) Tell me anything about yourself that you think would be of interest to me or other readers (some of you are not anonymous, so I know those who are lawyers in Colorado or engineers in Australia; that sort of thing)
