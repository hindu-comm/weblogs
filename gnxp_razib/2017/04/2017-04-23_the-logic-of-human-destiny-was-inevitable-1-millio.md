The logic of human destiny was inevitable 1 million years ago

At the time I was moderately skeptical of his thesis. It was too teleological for my tastes. And, it does pander to a bias in human psychology whereby we look to find meaning in the universe.

But this is 2017, and I have somewhat different views.

In the year 2000 I broadly accepted the thesis outlined a few years later in [The Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471252522/geneexpressio-20). That our species, our humanity, evolved and emerged in rapid sequence, likely due to biological changes of a radical kind, \~50,000 years ago. This is the thesis of the “great leap forward” of [behavioral modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity#Great_leap_forward).

Today I have come closer to models proposed by Michael Tomasello in [The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674005821/geneexpressio-20) and Terrence Deacon in [The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005Q65DLY/geneexpressio-20). Rather than a punctuated event, an instance in geological time, humanity as we understand it was a gradual process, driven by general dynamics and evolutionary feedback loops.

Sawyer’s often overly preachy [Neanderthal Parallax](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WTKIL7S/geneexpressio-20) series, that if our own lineage went extinct but theirs did not they would have created a technological civilization, is I think in the main correct. It may not be entirely coincidental that the hyper-drive cultural flexibility of African modern humans evolved in African modern humans first. There may have been sufficient biological differences to enable this to be likely. **But I believe that if African modern humans were removed from the picture Neanderthals would have “caught up” and been positioned to begin the trajectory we find ourselves in during the current Holocene inter-glacial.**

The data indicate that all human lineages were subject to increased encephalization. That process trailed off \~200,000 years ago, but it illustrates the general evolutionary pressures, ratchets, or evolutionary “logic”, that applied to all of them. Overall there were some general trends in the hominin lineage that began to characterized us about a million years ago. We pushed into new territory. Our rate of cultural change seems to gradually increased across our whole range.

One of the major holy grails I see now and then in human evolutionary genetics is to find “the gene that made us human.” The scramble is definitely on now that more and more whole genome sequences from ancient hominins are coming online. But I don’t think there will be such gene ever found. **There isn’t “a gene,” but a broad set of genes which were gradually selected upon in the process of making us human**.

In the lingo, it wasn’t just a hard sweep from a*de novo*mutation. It was as much, or even more, soft sweeps from standing variation.
