Living as Loki, friendship before Ragnarok

![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/loki.jpg?resize=300%2C262)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/loki.jpg?resize=300%2C262)In Norse mythology Loki is a trickster frost giant who also plays a god. His relationship to the Aesir is complicated, but at the end of days when the world is nearing its final hours he is fated to stand against his erstwhile companions. I do not know much about the Marvel comics adaptation of Loki, though I have seen the films, and this element of alternating between good and evil is evident onscreen.

Does the fact that Loki is destined to stand against Odin negate all their experiences together? Is the full measure of a life the final act? I don’t think so.

Today we live in an age [when he center is not holding](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/is-there-still-a-vital-center/). Politics and public life are polarizing. Apocalyptic language is in the air. Barack Obama was a socialist, a Communist, a Muslim. Now Donald J. Trump is the worst, thing, ever. And so on. **There are two teams, and if you do not choose a team, you have lost the game before it is played.** My pessimism about the possibility for a reinvigoration of a broadly liberal democratic order are for another post.

Recently my friend Heather Mac Donald [wrote about her experience](https://www.city-journal.org/html/get-up-stand-up-15109.html) with [protesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8yck_4ixgI) at [Claremont McKenna](https://www.city-journal.org/html/get-up-stand-up-15109.html). Her description of the student body’s hysterics are almost anodyne in how predictable they behaved. Rather, I was struck by how much invective Heather directed toward the silent faculty:

> …Those professors also maintain that to challenge that claim of > ubiquitous bigotry is to engage in “hate speech,” and that such speech > is tantamount to a physical assault on minorities and females. As > such, it can rightly be suppressed and punished. To those faculty, **I > am indeed a fascist, and a white supremacist,** with the attendant > loss of communication rights.

[Nicholas Christakis](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis) and [Alice Dreger](https://twitter.com/AliceDreger?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) are by any definition progressive liberals, but also adhere stridently to ideals of freedom of thought and speech. **But both have been subject to abuse and personal attacks.**They clearly fight on not because they are assured of victory, but because they believein the justness of their cause.

Many of my liberal friends express some exasperation that I identify as conservative. But the fact of the matter is that the far Left writes off much of this country, and many of my friends, and arguably me, as a white supremacist and a fascist. Ours are not thoughts worth having in the eyes of the heirs of [repressive tolerance](http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/60spubs/65repressivetolerance.htm). My liberal friends, being broad minded an of a tolerant bent, do not have sympathy with repression of thought. **But at the end of the days when sides are taken what side will they choose?**

I think here of an academic who is jaded and contemptuous of the infantile antics of the campus Left. He is worried that their provocations will result in the academy being targeted by the political Right. He does not relish conflict. Like me, he wants to be left alone to explore the topics which interest him. We share a mutual interest in evolutionary genetics. But, when and if the fight comes he does admit he must march with his colleagues, no matter how loony, and defend his side.

We both wish the world were not this polarized. But what we wish is not always what is. **But until Ragnarok we can continue to drink beer and fight our battles shoulder to shoulder as friends.** Neither of us want the Ragnarok of this liberal democratic republic to come, and I still hope it doesn’t. But we both understand that on that day we’ll be on different sides. And I’m OK with that. Life is not perfect, we do the best we can.
