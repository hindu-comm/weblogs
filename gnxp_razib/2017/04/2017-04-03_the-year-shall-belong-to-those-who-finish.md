The year shall belong to those who finish

Sanderson writes at a fast clip and finishes lots of books. Yes, his prose doesn’t stay with you like that of some other fantasists. But after all the years waiting for the next volume of [Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20), there’s something to be said for actually delivering something to the public.

Not that I myself get through many works of fiction per year anymore. I’ve had [The Wise Man’s Fear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00475AYJQ/geneexpressio-20) on my Kindle for seven years now. I keep waiting for the final entry so I can just finish the last two in one sitting. And yes, there’s [Seveneves](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00LZWV8JO/geneexpressio-20). All in good time….
