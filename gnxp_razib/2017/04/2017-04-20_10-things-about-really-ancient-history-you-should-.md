10 Things About Ancient History You Should Really Know

Basically all that came before Greece and Rome (from a Western perspective).

1\) The Bronze Age Near East had its own equivalent of a Westphalian system. See [The Brotherhood of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199858683/geneexpressio-20).

2\) Even in the 3rd Millennium BCE the world was quite international. There are references in Sumerian tablets to expatriate communities of merchants from [Meluhha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha#Indus_Valley_versus_Africa). Meluhha almost certainly referring to what we call the Indus Valley civilization.

3\) The relationship between Sumerians and Akkadians prefigures the relationship between the Greeks and Romans.Mesopotamia had long had Semitic speaking groups like Akkadians, as evidenced by their prominence in lists of rulers to an early date, but in the most antiqueperiod Sumerians were dominant. Over time though Sumerians disappeared as a distinct ethnicity, and the language was preserved as one of liturgy for thousands of years after their extinction.

4\) The longstanding antagonists of Sumer, the nation of Elam in southwest Iran, persisted for 1,500 years after the Sumerians left the scene. They were finally absorbed by the Medes and Persians in the 6th century BCE.

5\) Because cuneiform tablets can be baked and preserved our documentary evidence from some earlier periods in Near Eastern history is much better than more epochs, simply due to preservational differences.

The Hittites called themselves the Nesa, and ruled over various non-Indo-European popualtions, in particular the Hatti.

7\) Sumeria likelyhad a [larger population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer#Population) than the same area after the Mongol sack of Baghdad (there may also be an issue with salinization of lower Mesopotamia over time).

8\) The Biblical [Philistines](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/29/science/philistines-were-cultured-after-all-say-archeologists.html?pagewanted=all) may in part have been Bronze Age Greeks (**bonus**: the political units of Bronze Age Greece may have been larger than during the Classical period because bronze forging requires more mobilization of resources than iron).

9\) Pleistocene [“megafauna”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth#Extinction) survived into the Bronze Age.

10\) Indo-Europeans of an Indo-Aryan variant called the Mittani were the ruling class in much of the territory ruled by ISIS for the past few years. They even worshipped Indo-Aryan gods.

**Addendum:** I invite readers to give me better suggestions. I’m not an ancient historian, just an enthusiast!
