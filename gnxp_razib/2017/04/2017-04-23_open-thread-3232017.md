I assume it will stabilize in the next few weeks in the 400s.

So far the biggest surprise that I’ve noticed is the ratio of married to divorced; 14o to 9. But, this aligns with research that college educated people [do not get divorced](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/marriage-and-divorce-patterns-by-gender-race-and-educational-attainment-5.htm)at a high rate, and more than 50% of my readership has completed graduate educations, so the sample is probably even more biased.

In France it is [Marcon vs. Le Pen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2017-03-22/french-general-election-results-first-round) for the second round it seems. It seems likely Marcon will win the second round…but I do wonder if some far Left voters will refuse to vote for a candidate is a pretty transparent avatar of the globalist elite.

I love California, but, [In costly Bay Area, even six-figure salaries are considered ‘low income’](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/22/in-costly-bay-area-even-six-figure-salaries-are-considered-low-income/):

A family > of four with an income of \$105,350 per year is considered “low > income.” A \$65,800 annual income is considered “very low” for a > family the same size, and \$39,500 is “extremely low.” The median > income for those areas is \$115,300.

The problem many, but not all, Lefties in this part of the country have is their rhetoric is always about making housing affordable, not making more housing (which would naturally lead to more affordability).

I’d highly recommend it.

A new wave of [GSS data](http://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/analysis/?dataset=gss16) is out. Might start some GSS blogging again.

[Maybe moderate drinking isn’t so good for you after all](https://theconversation.com/maybe-moderate-drinking-isnt-so-good-for-you-after-all-72266):
