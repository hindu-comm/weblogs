The origin of organismic gangs

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/k8239.gif?resize=200%2C303)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/k8239.gif?resize=200%2C303)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//geneexpressio-20)When W. D. Hamilton was a student he expressed an interest in exploring the problem of altruism in an evolutionary context. His struggles in getting anyone interested in the issue and supporting his study of the topic is extensively detailed in [Narrow Roads of Gene Land](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716745305/geneexpressio-20). But he persevered and for his efforts he came up with the framework of [inclusive fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness) (John Maynard Smith’s term was [kin selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection)). To a great extent it was a revolutionary model, formalizing what he been roughly understood verbally.

But could inclusive fitness explain the social structure we see around us? Hamilton attempted to extend the framework to humans in the 1970s, but that was not particularly fruitful. Other dynamics which emerged on the scene drew more from game theory. Again, John Maynard Smith loomed large, but Robert Trivers also introduced [reciprocal altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism) into the lexicon. These sorts of processes were much favored by thinkers such as Richard Dawkins because they are simple elementary strategies and relations that are tractable, and can be programmed dand simulated (or analytically explored).

David Sloan Wilson, along with E. O. Wilson, have been trying to revive models predicated on higher levels of organization. Though often termed “group selection,” the first Wilson correctly labels it “multi-level selection theory.” Though I am willing to agree that the pendulum swung too far in favor of individual level game theory and inclusive fitness in the last few decades, I do find David Sloan Wilson’s triumphalism a bit much (though his books are worth reading, and I think this is a personality issue with David, as he engages in the same triumphalism with economists).

A lot of work still needs to be done to explain social organization and behavior, even in social insects! With that, two preprints in biorxiv caught my attention.

First, [Co-evolution of dispersal with behaviour favours social polymorphism](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/13/127316). In it the authors model a system where there are dispersing individuals and sessile individuals, and show that cooperative behavior and the sessile morph and selfish behavior and the dispersing morph can persist as two alternative strategies. The paper makes the assumption that the sets of behaviors are caused by different genes which are linked, and show that low recombination is necessary to maintain the linkage. This does not seem genetically realistic.

I haven’t dug into the formal models in the methods sections of either preprint, so I won’t say much more. But, I will offer that as someone who has long been interested in this field **there is a surfeit and not enough data to test the models.** It is time for someone ambitious to figure out how to make these areas more empirically testable.
