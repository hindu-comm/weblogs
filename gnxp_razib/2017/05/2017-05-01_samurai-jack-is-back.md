After all these years, [Samurai Jack](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N3WGYMA/geneexpressio-20) is back. You can find [the first three episodes](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/samurai-jack/) at the [Adult Swim](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/samurai-jack/) website. A little Googling will get you the rest of them. There are three episodes left to finish out the series.

It’s pretty incredible that this short, which I watched in the first half of the 2000s, comes back in 2017. In the interim the original actor who voiced [Aku](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Aku) died, but the replacement seems rather good to me (I wouldn’t have noticed the difference).

What makes this series so special? I think it’s the seamless melange of motifs, whether from medieval Japan to a steampunk retrofuture, to science fictional time travel, combined with a stylized animation which gives one the appropriate impression of disorientation that the protagonist must be feeling when confronted with a nightmarish future.
