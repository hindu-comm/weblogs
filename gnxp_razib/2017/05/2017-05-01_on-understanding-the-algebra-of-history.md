On understanding the algebra of history

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/featured.jpg?resize=300%2C460)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/featured.jpg?resize=300%2C460)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452288193/geneexpressio-20)Over the years I’ve convinced many people to read Scott Atran’s [In God’s We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20). Why? **Because it gives you a basic framework for understanding and interpreting religious phenomena.**

The cognitive anthropological toolkit does not give you the total resources of decomposing religious phenomena. But, it is probably a necessary toolkit to begin at the process of carving it up tractably. And since people talk about religion constantly I think it is important that learn to talk about it more rationally and empirically.

**I believe my friend [Peter Turchin](https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Turchin/e/B001IU2M2K/geneexpressio-20) is doing something similar with [cliodynamics](http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics), which attempts to model history formally and quantitatively.** Unlike classical cliometric analysis, which was mostly descriptive, Peter attempts to construct models which make predictions which can be tested.

Of course to test these models you need well organized data. To do this he has been instrumental in pushing forward the [Seshat: Global History Databank](http://seshatdatabank.info/) (which I have supported with a [donation](https://evolution-institute.org/seshat/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/contribute/transact&reset=1&id=8)).

Cliodynamics is a few decades behind cognitive anthropology as a field. I’m still following it closely because it hasn’t hit the point of diminishing returns for me yet.

Well, here I am boosting him up a bit! Of his books, I’ve read three related to history, [War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452288193/geneexpressio-20), [Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691116695/geneexpressio-20), and [Secular Cycles](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691136963/geneexpressio-20). For those who are curious about Peter’s ecological scholarship, [Complex Population Dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691090203/geneexpressio-20) may be of interest.

Also, here are my [10 questions for Peter Turchin](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/10-questions-for-peter-turchin.php).
