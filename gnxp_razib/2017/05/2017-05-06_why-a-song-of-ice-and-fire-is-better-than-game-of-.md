Why A Song of Ice and Fire is more definitive than A Game of Thrones

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/51VIRKRwW0L.jpg?resize=300%2C476)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/51VIRKRwW0L.jpg?resize=300%2C476)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20)*Wired* has a piece out [George R. R. Martin Doesn’t Need to Finish Writing the Game of Thrones Books](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-books/). The title is needlessly provocative, as there are many good points in the article (though I understand clickbait considerations). Over the years I’ve come to expect and accept that the “great fork” is here to stay, and the books and the the television shows are in some deep and fundamental ways going to be distinct narratives (though Martin and the producers of the television show assert that their conclusion will be congruent, which I actually think may not be optimal).

But the author dismisses an important point rather flippantly:

> For the last few years being able to say **“Sure, yes, but the books > are better”** has provided a nice little dopamine rush. But beyond > that thrill, what Game of Thrones fans really want is more Game of > Thrones. And right now, their best bet for getting that is on premium > cable.

Earlier there are comparisons made to the books which inspired [Jaws](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008IU9KQO/geneexpressio-20), [The Godfather](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0022Q8CSC/geneexpressio-20), [The Shining](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BANK32/geneexpressio-20), and [Blade Runner](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEGTI0/geneexpressio-20). These are all cases where films overshadowed the literary works which preceded them.

But **none of these works are on par with the world-building and richness of George R. R. Martin’s series** (especially the first three books, [A Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001DBI1Q/geneexpressio-20), [A Clash of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001MC01Y/geneexpressio-20), and [A Storm of Swords](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00026WUZU/geneexpressio-20)). Additionally, in the case of the [Jaws](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008IU9KQO/geneexpressio-20) and [The Godfather](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0022Q8CSC/geneexpressio-20) I think most people agree that the films are far superior artistic productions to the books. And in relation to *Blade Runner*, most people know that Philip K Dick’s story [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEGTI0/geneexpressio-20) was only tenuously connected to the movie adaptation.

I understand that writers are sometimes given tasks or make a really good pitch on the most general terms. But if the points wouldn’t pass muster wit your high school English teacher, should they pass muster with a national magazine? In the clickbait era, probably. But I’m still here to point out that Mrs. Barry would not have approved….
