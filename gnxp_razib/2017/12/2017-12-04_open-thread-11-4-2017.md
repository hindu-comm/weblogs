Open Thread, 11/4/2017

A disproportionate number of submissions to the [South Asian Genotype Project](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/12/02/south-asian-genotype-project/) have been Bangladeshi. That surprised me. Though I’ve gotten a few obscure submissions, so all for the good. I’ll update submitters by email in the next day or two and probably note something on next week’s open thread.

If my original post wasn’t clear: **I really hope to get more samples from the “cow belt.”**

One thing I should be explicit about: **my reading of history leads me to believe that social and cultural revolutions can happen really fast because of nonlinear dynamics**. This is why ‘predicting’ history is such a mug’s game. The way it seems to work is that everything is fine, then next thing you know you’re face is smashed against a windshield with no warning. To give a concrete example, in 1785 it would have been hard to imagine the religious dimension in the [War in the Vendée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e#Genocide_controversy) less than 10 years later. Similarly, Germany in the 1920s was one of the most socially liberal societies on the planet. And, in the Europe-wide context for several decades German Jews were among the most assimilated and tolerated populations on the continent.

Been busy with work and stuff leading up to Holidays. What’s going on?
