Well, Merry Christmas Eve!

I’ve been rereading [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00J6YBOFQ/geneexpressio-20). Recommended. A little different now that I’ve been involved in start-ups.

I would say that a lot of it is a pretty straightforward application of stuff you’ll encounter in economics and economic history to Silicon Valley (e.g., economic growth through technology vs. Smithian growth through globalization).

Haven’t had time to work on the South Asian Genotype Project much since I’ve burned a lot of hours on the margin moving websites. I’ll get back to it in the next few days.

Just a reminder, **two days now to get \$80 off Helix products** (say early hours of December 26th), including [Neanderthal](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal/?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=early-bird&utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=social), [Metabolism](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-metabolism/?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=early-bird&utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=social) and [Regional Ancestry](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-regional-ancestry/?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=early-bird&utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=social).

A friend asked about which podcasts I listen to. Here are the ones I listen to habitually:

[In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads). I’ve been listening to this podcast for 10 years now.[The Glenn Show](https://bloggingheads.tv/programs/glenn-show) on bloggingheads.tv. Probably listen to 75% of these discussions.[Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money)and [Tides of History](https://wondery.com/wondery/shows/tidesofhistory/).

[Secular Jihadists](https://secularjihadists.libsyn.com/). One of the cohosts pointed out on the last episode that Stalin and Mao killed more people than Hitler. Oh, and that white people are the “least racist.” We live in a predictable world, and this podcast always surprises me with the originality of the hosts (though I demur from their New Atheism).

[Chap Trap House](https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house). I don’t really get it, but the bro-banter is pretty amusing to me.

[Stuff You Missed In History Class](https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts).

[Politics Podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/) from FiveThirtyEight.

Also, my [podcast](https://insitome.libsyn.com/website) with Spencer Wells is going well (if downloads are any measure). We have some stuff coming up on Neanderthals (two episodes), as well as the Aryan invasion of India. You can find it on iTunes, Stitcher, and Google Play too (Spotify hasn’t gotten back to me).

I’ll be taking some time off from this weblog and my day job spending some time with my kids the week after Christmas. I’ll probably post stuff if I really have to, but otherwise might be a little quieter….
