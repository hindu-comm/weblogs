Manufacturing Chinese history cheaply

I don’t want to rehash why Terrill presented this strange framework as a central thesis in his book. Rather, there was an instance that I found memorable where he observed that Deng was much more particular about pointing out territorial losses that China had suffered with foreign dignitaries than Mao.**Deng was more conventionally nationalistic**.

I always felt that this required some*chutzpah*on Deng’s part. The map above shows clearly why I found it curious: the maximal extend of the Chinese Empire in the 19th century was to due to the imperial ambitions of the *Manchu* people, under whose yoke the Han experienced centuries of being a subordinate group. Of course it is true that just as Greece conquered Rome, so the Manchus assimilated into Chinese society to such an extent that today they have basically been [absorbed by the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people#Modern_times) in all but name. And famously, rulers such as the Kangxi Emperor and the Qianlong Emperor, became for their Han subjects, that is the vast majority of them, paragons of the Confucian potentate.

They struggled against their assimilation, and in their conquests outside of their civilized Chinese heartland the emperors became Manchurian warlords (the [Kangxi Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor#Early_reign) in particular paints a broadly as a steppe warlord when he deigned to take on that persona). They were a people from from beyond the Great Wall, who had good relations with the [Khalkha Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalkha_Mongols), and cultivated the Buddhist statelets of greater Tibet. In China, but not always of it. In other words, the empire which the republic of China inherited by and large was the achievement of a non-Chinese people.

Modern borders are what they are. Accidents of history. I don’t begrudge the Han Chinese for having inheriting the Manchu Empire. To some extent it’s their luck. But it’s a little strange that Deng Xiaoping would assume that the borders of the [Treaty of Nerchinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor#Early_reign), signed in 1689, were somehow sacrosanct. The Manchus were at this period waxing into the fullness of their powers, and blocked Russia from bringing the Amur basin into its hegemony (and also banned Han from migrating into these new territories!).

Their forces famously clashed with that of the Abbasids at [Talas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talas) in modern day Kyrgyzstan. But this dominion lasted only a century. The earlier Han dynasty hegemonies over the eastern Silk Road cities were also short-lived.

As you can see on this map the Tang had to contend with a powerful Tibetan Empire, as well as Uighurs and Goturks to their north. On the northeast, in modern Manchuria, were the Khitan people, who would later reappear in Chinese history.

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chinatang.jpeg?resize=182%2C276)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chinatang.jpeg?resize=182%2C276)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003WE9C5A/geneexpressio-20)The reality is that for most of Chinese history half of what is today China was not part of China.** If the Manchus had not conquered China, and the Ming had been replaced by an indigenous dynasty, it seems entirely likely that the outlines of the modern nation-state of China would be coterminous with with the outlines of the Ming dynasty polity.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mingchina.jpeg?resize=175%2C205)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mingchina.jpeg?resize=175%2C205)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mingchina.jpeg)

To me a plausible “alternative history” then would result in Xinjiang and Mongolia being absorbed into the orbit of the Russia Empire, and perhaps both today being post-Soviet states. In fact, northern Xinjiang would be a distinct post-Soviet state, because prior to [genocidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzungar_genocide) campaigns by the Manchus in the 18th century this area was dominated by a western branch of the Mongol people, the [Oirats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oirats). It seems likely that Tibet would have fallen more explicitly under the British orbit, and become independent along with India and other South and Southeast Asian nations after World War II.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kangxi.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kangxi.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008GOL2P4/geneexpressio-20)This historical context is relevant to the situation of why minority groups such as Uyghurs and Tibetans chafe under Chinese rule, especially when told that they have always been part of China. It also is important because it gives a sense of cultural and historical affinities which might go unnoticed.

Broadly speaking Korea, and to a lesser extent Japan and Vietnam (in different ways), have been part of the broader “Sinic civilization.” There are differences of detail, particularly in Japan and Vietnam, in how Chinese culture was interpreted, but its influence is undeniable. This is less clear in places like Tibet and Mongolia. I believe people sometimes confuse Chinese cultural influence with China’s geopolitical heft and the fact that to Westerners these people look East Asian, so how could they not be influenced by China despite their proximity?

But this section is simply false: “While Buddhism is an import from China, shamanism is an expression of Mongolian national identity.” **Mongols are mostly Tibetan Buddhists, and they received their Buddhism from Tibetan lamas and monks**. Not Chinese. It is technically important to remember that though Tibet is part of China, but it was not part of China when it was propagating Buddhism to Mongolia!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/empiresofsilkroad-1.jpeg?resize=125%2C194)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/empiresofsilkroad-1.jpeg?resize=125%2C194)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691150346/geneexpressio-20)For a detailed exploration of the Mongol religious conversion to Tibetan Buddhism, and their flirtation with Islam\*\*, see [Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B4FJBKU/geneexpressio-20). What I will say is that it does not seem to be a surprise that Mongols seem to have a history of flirting with*non-Chinese* religions. Many of Genghis Khan’s subjects during his rise to power were at least nominally Syriac Christians. Though Genghis Khan was an adherent of shamanism, he patronized religious professionals of many sects, and had a particularly close relationship with a Daoist monk.

Ambiguities as to the genealogy of cultural relationships also crops up in this piece in *The New York Times*, [China and India File Rival Claims Over Tibetan Medicine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/world/asia/unesco-tibetan-medicine-india-china.html?smid=tw-nythealth&smtyp=cur&_r=0). Obviously Asia’s two most powerful nations fighting over the heritage of Tibetan medicine is unseemly and gauche, though perhaps a little less worrisome than the saber rattling which is occurring on the [northeast border right now](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-india-border-idUSKBN1AJ1TP).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/vajrabuddhism.jpeg?resize=176%2C286)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/vajrabuddhism.jpeg?resize=176%2C286)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AR2WSII/geneexpressio-20)Geographically Tibet is obviously within the borders of the modern Chinese nation-state (though Ladakh in India is arguably a fragment of Tibet which landed on the Indian side of the border). But recall that **for most of its history Tibet has not been under Chinese rule.** Perhaps even more importantly, Tibet has not been under much Chinese influence. On the contrary, Tibetan lamas have been cultural impresarios, exporting their religious vision to the court of Kublai Khan, then that of the Manchus, and the finally converting the Khans of the various Mongol tribes.

And in terms of its precursors, [Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism) is the child of the last flowering of North Indian Buddhism, **not** Chinese Buddhism, which had evolved into an independent tradition by the time the Tibetan Empire was deciding on an institutional religion to adhere to (Chinese Buddhism was reputedly brought to the kingdom first, by a Chinese princess).\*\*\* And the Tibetan alphabet is also derived from an Indian script. Curiously, just as Indian high-level cultural influence is very salient in Southeast Asia, so it is in Buddhist Inner Asia. But while Southeast Asian Indian influences were usually maritime South Indian, those of Tibetan are from a bygone North India where Islam was marginal and Buddhism was still a presence.

There are a million [Chinese](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-china-knows-about-africa-the-west-doesnt-16295) in Africa. Even though China may not catch up with the United States in median affluence any time soon, the trajectory of aggregate economic production is such it will likely become the the [largest economy](http://fortune.com/2017/02/09/study-china-will-overtake-the-u-s-as-worlds-largest-economy-before-2030/) within the next half generation. The Chinese know this, and are already acting as if they are \#1. They’re preparing for their “time in the sun.”

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/openEMpire.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/openEMpire.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393973743/geneexpressio-20)Unfortunately this will exacerbate some of the unfortunate intellectual tendencies among the Chinese due to arrogance combined with a lack of total confidence in their new position. The Chinese view of their past has strange distortions, generally having to do with the fact that they don’t want to admit that their possession of vast swaths of Inner Asia was more a matter of historical happenstance than a necessary consequence of the geographical logic of the Chinese civilization-state.

But the truth is what it is. Unfortunately I suspect implicitly the media will begin telegraphing the Chinese viewpoint without much challenge because it seems plausible enough to those that they don’t know. It will be up to us to keep the unknowing propagandists in check.



\* I am aware of their Xianbei heritage, but they were highly Sinicized and by the time of great [Xuanzong Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang) they were mostly Han in origin.

\*\* Mongols outside of the homeland invariably eventually became Muslims over time.

\*\*\* I am aware that Chinese Buddhism itself has an Indian source, though mediated through the cities of the Silk Road.
