![Razib & Dr. Ghulam Sarwar (1896-1996)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/grandf.jpg?resize=300%2C377)

I showed my daughter a photo of my maternal grandfather yesterday. He was holding me in his lap. It’s probably about 1981, so he would have been about 85 years old then. I was his first grandchild, as he had a family late in life. He saw a lot of changes in his life. Born into the British Raj during the late Victorian period, he died when I was using the internet regularly to email friends and relatives.

In his home village they called him the “Goony Doctor”, as Ghani was part of his longer surname.

Seems like an interesting and relevant book. On the other hand, we always have to keep in mind that [China’s labor force peaked several years ago](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-27/china-s-falling-labor-participation-rate-adds-to-growth-squeeze). The demographic pressures on China in the 21st century will probably always mean that it won’t exhibit the vigor of a nation like the United States of America during the baby boom.

Hurricane Harvey has [been a big deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/harvey-delivers-heavy-damage-as-it-batters-texas-coast/2017/08/27/c35ab7c0-8ae6-11e7-961d-2f373b3977ee_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory). In Central Texas we’ve been hunkering down, but it’s Houston that is in real danger. America’s 4th largest city.

Still soliciting [sign ups for my newsletter](http://razib.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=68e76131336a8f29b88c5e5c9&id=4be5c128df). It’s more of a “hey Twitter has disappeared here is where I am on the web” notification system. Have only sent one mailing so far. Will increase frequency in future, but probably max once a month.

Scientists are smart, but they don’t know everything. To understand ‘intelligence testing’ I recommend people read [Intelligence: All That Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00RTY0LPO/geneexpressio-20) or [The Neuroscience of Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2PFJPO/geneexpressio-20). People throw around ideas like “GRE is culturally biased,” but cultural bias on testing is a whole topic with a specific meaning. That is, **are the tests able to predict future performance on tasks to the same extent across groups?**

I suspect that the GRE is on its way out though. Many scholars don’t support the shift, but they won’t say much in public lest they be attacked. Of course that will lead to greater emphasis on undergraduate school attended as well as the eminence of those giving recommendations.

(note, if a university uses the GRE appropriately there should be no correlation between outcome and GRE score, as they filter out all the students that need to be filtered out)
