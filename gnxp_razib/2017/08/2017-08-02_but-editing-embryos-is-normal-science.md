But editing embryos is normal science!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crispr.jpg?resize=300%2C243)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crispr.jpg?resize=300%2C243)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)The media is writing breathless stories about the recent CRISPR “embryo-editing”, [In Breakthrough, Scientists Edit a Dangerous Mutation From Genes in Human Embryos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/science/gene-editing-human-embryos.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront).

The paper is out in *Nature*, [Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23305.html?foxtrotcallback=true).

My major confusion is that this is [normal science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_science). The breakthrough was the discovery of the power of CRISPR-Cas9. Once the discovery was made there was a literally stampede to use the technique because its power and ease was so manifest. What’s happening now is that the technique is getting more powerful and effective. **I think it would surprise people if it *didn’t* get better**.

A major problem for economists in modeling productivity growth is that innovation is unpredictable. But in this case the big innovation has occurred. The next few decades are likely going to see progressive and continuous improvement in the technology. Where that will lead us? Unpredictable….
