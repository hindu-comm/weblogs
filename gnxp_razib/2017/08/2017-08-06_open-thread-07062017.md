[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rscottbakker.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rscottbakker.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQY4CA1/geneexpressio-20)I know that George R. R Martin has stated that the ending to [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20) is going to be bittersweet. R. Scott Bakker’s [conclusion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQY4CA1/geneexpressio-20) to the [Aspect Emperor](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=aspect+emperor&tag=geneexpressio-20) tetralogy ends with a bittersour ending. Fair warning.

Also, the writing of the last third of [The Unholy Consult](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQY4CA1/geneexpressio-20) was good in terms of packing a lot of action and plotting, but it was hard to keep track of all the obscure names.

The new episode of [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073ZSP1P9/geneexpressio-20) is very good. Nice for things to actually happen.

I’ve been offline most of the weekend. Several people asked me about the [Google Memo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320). Here’s the weird thing: huge subcultures within the organization aren’t even American. Several friends for example have been token Americans on Chinese teams. Their values and priorities are obviously very different even if they don’t inform the ‘public face’ of the company. It’s all rather strange (yes, whoever wrote that memo will surely be fired).

[How Democrats Killed Their Populist Soul](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/). I think Matt Stoller’s anti-monopolist views should appeal to many people on the Right as well as the Left. Google and Facebook are arguably much more powerful than any state government when it comes to shaping our culture.

A. N. Wilson spent five years working on a biography of [Charles Darwin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01NCWE6KA/geneexpressio-20) that is coming out next year. So he published [It’s Time Charles Darwin Was Exposed for the Fraud He Was](https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/it-s-time-charles-darwin-was-exposed-for-the-fraud-he-was-a3604166.html). I find Darwin idolatry a bit much sometimes personally. And I’m not deeply versed in his intellectual biography. I’ve read [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B019J0UJ9S/geneexpressio-20), and have read several of [Peter J. Bowler’s](https://www.amazon.com/Peter-J.-Bowler/e/B001IQXQPG/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_4?qid=1502077491&sr=1-4&tag=geneexpressio-20) works.

I can only comment on what I know in more detail. At some point Wilson tries to tag Neo-Darwinians with Dawkins’ atheism. But Dawkins is an extreme case. Arguably the god-father of the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis, R. A. Fisher, was an Anglican and a Tory. No offense to Dawkins, but his substantive scientific contribution is dwarfed by Fisher. And yet Wilson is pushing Dawkins to the front as an exemplar of Neo-Darwinism.

Wilson also says that Neo-Darwinians couldn’t therefore revere Gregor Mendel because he was a monk. It’s all rather strange because it’s called “***Mendelian*** Genetics.” Not mention that biographies I’ve read suggested that Mendel himself was not excessively pious. Rather, his monastic vocation freed him from financial worries, allowing him sufficient leisure to engage in studies. But perhaps I’m wrong in this, after all Wilson has studied Darwin for five years!

Finally, there is the utilization of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldridge to attack Darwinian gradualism. I’m not a big fan of all this macroevolutionary talk, but the late Gould and Eldridge would not be happy to be drafted in this way. Charles Darwin was wrong on a lot of things. **That’s because he had a lot of ideas**.

The central deep insight from Darwin’s theory was the power of natural selection to shape variation and drive adaptation. **One can argue about the importance of this dynamic in evolutionary process, but the fact that it is still being studied shows how fruitful Darwin’s theory was in generating a living program of science.**
