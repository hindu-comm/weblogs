But perhaps time to read Peter Turchin’s [Ages of Discord: A Structural-Demographic Analysis of American History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XDLT2C5/geneexpressio-20). I was skeptical when Peter presented this idea years ago. Less so now.

I’m on the eclipse train. The whole family will be chasing it soon.

[Paul Thompson](https://twitter.com/PTenigma) is on Twitter. If you read this blog in the early/middle 2000s it will be a familiar name. Paul had thought I had stopped blogging! Moving platforms every few years does that.

I’ve only sent out one mailing so far, but may increase the frequency to once a month or so. Mostly I’m a little worried that without Twitter people like me who produce content, but aren’t affiliated with a media distribution channel, are going to get lost in the din.

Anyway, please [sign up](http://razib.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=68e76131336a8f29b88c5e5c9&id=4be5c128df) if you don’t follow me on Twitter (or if you do).
