[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/download.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/download.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWFM3PP/geneexpressio-20)Finished [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWFM3PP/geneexpressio-20). The basic thesis that reasoning is a way to convince people after you’ve already come to a conclusion, that is, rationalization, was already one I shared. That makes sense since one of the coauthors, Dan Sperber, has been influential in the [“naturalistic”](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631200452/geneexpressio-20) school of anthropology. If you’ve read books like [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058RTMXG/geneexpressio-20) [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWFM3PP/geneexpressio-20) goes fast. **But it is important to note that the cognitive anthropology perspective is useful in things besides religion.** I’m thinking in particular of politics.

I haven’t been blogging much since I was abroad on a business trip. Specifically to the Persian Gulf. I’ll say more later, though I am going to be vague on geography since I’d rather not mix these two streams of my life (also, to be clear, this is not related to my day job).

[One Family, Many Revolutions: From Black Panthers, to Silicon Valley, to Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/technology/one-family-many-revolutions-from-black-panthers-to-silicon-valley-to-trump.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0). I had known of this connection before, between Ben Horowitz, the Silicon Valley VC guy, and David Horowitz, the right-wing provocateur. The elder Horowitz’s contention that one needs to play dirty to get anywhere is a position that I believe has more support today than it did ten years ago. The culture has come to him.

[Don’t Believe in God? Maybe You’ll Try U.F.O.s](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/opinion/sunday/dont-believe-in-god-maybe-youll-try-ufos.html). No surprise.

[43 Senators Want to Make It a Federal Crime to Boycott Israeli Settlements](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/senate-bill-would-make-it-a-federal-crime-to-boycott-israel.html). Here are the [sponsors](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/720/cosponsors). I’ve never felt so sympathetic toward BDS….

My piece in *India Today* on South Asian genetics is hitting the printing press this week.
