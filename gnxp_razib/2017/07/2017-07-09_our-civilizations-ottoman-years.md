Our civilization’s Ottoman years

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/download-27.jpeg?resize=188%2C268)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/download-27.jpeg?resize=188%2C268)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MZ74ZSZ/geneexpressio-20)Some right-wing intellectuals are wont to say that multicultural and multiracial empires do not last. This is not true. Historically there are plenty which lasted for quite a long time. Rome, Byzantium, and the Ottomans, to name just a few of the longest. But, though they were diverse polities modern liberal democratic sensibilities would have been offended by them. **That is because these empires were ordered and centered around a hegemonic culture, with other cultures accepted and tolerated on the condition of submission and subordination.**

The Ottoman example is the most stark because it was formally explicit under the [millet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Ottoman_Empire)) by the end of its history, though it naturally evolved out of Islamic conceptions of the roles of *dhimmis* under Muslim hegemony. For 500 years the Ottomans ruled a multicultural empire. Yes, it decayed and collapsed, but 500 years is a good run.

Both of us agree that immiseration seems on the horizon, and that no contemporary political movement has a good response. But I pointed out that traditionally redistributive socialism seems most successful in relatively homogeneous societies, and the United States is not that. American society is diverse. Descriptively multicultural. There would be another likely solution.

Eleven years ago Amartya Sen wrote a piece for *The New Republic* which could never get published in the journal today, [The Uses and Abuses of Multiculturalism](http://www.pierretristam.com/Bobst/library/wf-58.htm). In it he looked dimly upon the emergence of plural monoculturalism. Today plural monoculturalism is the dominant ideal of the identity politics Left, with cultural appropriation in vogue, and separatism reminiscent of the 1970s starting to come back into fashion. Against plural monoculturalism he contrasted genuine multiculturalism. **I think a better word for it is cosmopolitanism**.

The Sultan himself often had a Christian mother, while during the apex of the empire the shock troops were janissary forces drawn from the*dhimmi*peoples of the Balkans. This was a common feature of the Islamic, and before them Byzantine and Roman empires. The ruling elites exhibited a common *ethos*, but their origins were variegated.

Many of the Byzantine emperors were not from ethnic Greek Chalcedonian Christian backgrounds (before the loss of the Anatolian territories many were of Armenian, and therefore non-Chalcedonian, origin). But the culture they assimilated to, and promoted, as the core identity of the empire was Greek-speaking and Chalcedonian, with a self-conscious connection to ancient Rome. I can give similar examples from South Asia or China. Diverse peoples can be bound together in a sociopolitical order, but it is invariably one of domination, subordination, and specialization.

But subordinate peoples had their own hierarchies, and these hierarchies interacted with the Ottoman Sultan in an almost feudal fashion. Toleration for the folkways of these subordinate populations was a given, so long as they paid their tax and were sufficiently submissive. The leaders of the subordinate populations had their own power, albeit under the penumbra of the ruling class, which espoused the hegemonic *ethos*.

Rather, there will be accommodation and understandings. Much of the population will be subject to immiseration of subsistence but not flourishing. They may have some universal basic income, but they will be lack the dignity of work. Identity, religious and otherwise, will become necessary opiums of the people. The people will have their tribunes, who represent their interests, and give them the illusion or semi-reality of a modicum agency.

The tribunes, who will represent classical ethno-cultural blocs recognizable to us today, will deal with a supra-national global patriciate. Like the Ottoman elite it will not necessarily be ethnically homogeneous. There will be aspects of meritocracy to it, but it will be narrow, delimited, and see itself self-consciously above and beyond local identities and concerns. The patriciate itself may be divided. **But their common dynamic will be that they will be supra-national, mobile, and economically liberated as opposed to dependent**.

Of course democracy will continue. Augustus claimed he revived the Roman Republic. The tiny city-state of Constantinople in the 15th century claimed it was the Roman Empire. And so on. Outward forms and niceties may be maintained, **but death of the nation-state at the hands of identity politics and late stage capitalism will usher in the era of oligarchic multinationalism**.

I could be wrong. I hope I am.
