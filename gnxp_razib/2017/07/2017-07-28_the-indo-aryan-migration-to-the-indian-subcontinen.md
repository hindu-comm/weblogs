The Indo-Aryan migration to the Indian subcontinent

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/horsewheellanguage.jpeg?resize=217%2C233)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/horsewheellanguage.jpeg?resize=217%2C233)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20)The [piece is up at](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vedic-aryan-race-genetics-dna-europe-indians-europe-caspian/1/1012041.html) *India Today*. The headline and title are of course optimized for clicks. I would, for example, say that the Indo-Aryans came from the west, not the West.

In the course of writing this it has become clear that many people have very specific commitments on this issue. I think it is clear I do not. Genetic inference methods have **wide shoulders of confidence in particular dates.** So I’ll leave it to those with more archaeological knowledge to argue over specific date. But it strikes me that the dates point to a likelihood that much of the expansion and diversification of Indo-Aryans may precede their expansion into the Gangetic plain \~1500 BCE, the date preferred by many scholars.

Apparently we shouldn’t have to wait too long for ancient DNA from Rakighari (months, not years). But I doubt that will settle anything, as opposed to being preliminary and setting off new debates.
