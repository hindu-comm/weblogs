Does Tad Williams still have game?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-8-2.jpeg?resize=181%2C279)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-8-2.jpeg?resize=181%2C279)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IAUG3FM/geneexpressio-20)Like many people I was quite taken with Tad Williams [Memory, Sorry, and Throne](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00W82WYXY/geneexpressio-20), when they came out in the years around 1990. George R. R. Martin has admitted that Williams’ trilogy helped awaken him to the possibilities of the fantasy genre.

I tried to read his [Shadowmarch](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00452V3ZA/geneexpressio-20) series, but I didn’t find it as original so gave up after one and a half books. So I was excited for Williams to go back to a world where he seemed to shine. The first reviews for [The Witchwood Crown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IAUG3FM/geneexpressio-20) make it seem like it’s actually pretty good, and perhaps even might be better then the original series. Not sure frankly I’ll ever get to reading it, but who knows.

**Addendum:** In the fall Brandon Sanderson is coming out with [Oathbringer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01NAWAH85/geneexpressio-20), and R. Scott Bakker’s [Unholy Consult](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQY4CA1/geneexpressio-20) will be out at the end of July. I preordered the latter because I thought Bakker’s [third book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01F0DFM0O/geneexpressio-20) in the tetralogy was actually better than the [first](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00XBMN9ZW/geneexpressio-20) [two](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B010MEQ0Z2/geneexpressio-20) so I have hopes the fourth will be best of all.
