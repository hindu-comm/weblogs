Most popular GNXP post of all time?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/eempiresofsilk.jpg?resize=200%2C309)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/eempiresofsilk.jpg?resize=200%2C309)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004UGKKBE/geneexpressio-20)Was talking to a friend and mentioned offhand that the most popular GNXP post of all time was written in 2010 very casually and because of a question on Twitter posed by Jason Goldman. At 700,000 Google Analytics [sessions](https://www.business2community.com/seo/session-look-google-analytics-change-0863538#PScye3Bzozt9rhCV.97) it periodically still gets bumped up by places like Reddit.

The book to the right is a pretty big clue. Can you guess the post? I’m posting the link in the comments below….
