Before the Indo-Europeans in Ukraine

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20)It’s been ten years since I read [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20). It’s a great book, but some of the material was very wrong. The author, David Anthony, helped provide samples which undercut his thesis that Indo-Europeanization in Europe was mostly a matter of elite cultural diffusion. Rather, it looks as if there was a [massive migration from the steppes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317).

[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20) was heavy on archaeology which I found hard to follow. The [Cucuteni–Trypillia culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucuteni%E2%80%93Trypillia_culture) plays a major role in the narrative since it seems to have been a source of cultural influence on the Yamnaya steppe culture which eventually overran it. A new preprint seems to confirm **that there was a genetic discontinuity.** [Analysis of ancient human mitochondrial DNA from Verteba Cave, Ukraine: insights into the origins and expansions of the Late Neolithic-Chalcolithic Cututeni-Tripolye Culture](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/10/217109)

There is stuff in the preprint about population expansion. My personal opinion is that in most cases genetics doesn’t add much beyond what archaeology does for humans in reconstructing population history. Rather, these results in concern with others are strongly indicative of population turnover. Uniparental lineages are still useful, but only in the context of other data.

The great thing about genetics when it is so clear and striking is that it clears up confusions about relationships in the past that otherwise would be unclear. It’s like having a time machine. So we now know that early European farmers (EEF) were ancestors of this particular culture. Over the next decade or so we’ll get a really granular understanding of the ebb and flow of populations across prehistoric and historic Europe. This won’t abolish all controversy, but it will reduce the space of the unknown….
