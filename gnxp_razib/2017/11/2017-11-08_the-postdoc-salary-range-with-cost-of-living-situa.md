The postdoc salary range with cost of living (situation probably worst than reported)

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pd1.jpg?resize=625%2C600)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pd1.jpg?resize=625%2C600)  
*Nature* has an article, [Pay for US postdocs varies wildly by institution](http://www.nature.com/news/pay-for-us-postdocs-varies-wildly-by-institution-1.22932). True, but as Matt Hahn, professor of biology at Indian University in Bloomington (cost of living 93% of the USA average) observed there isn’t any correction for cost of living. The researcher who dug through the data actually posted it [online](http://futureofresearch.org/investigating-postdoc-salaries/), so I decided to correct that oversight.

I took the institutions with N \> 20, and looked up the cost of living in [Best Places](http://www.bestplaces.net/). The plot above is messy, but you can see that lots of institutions are paying a standard median salary of around \$47,500, no matter the cost of living.

The correlation between cost of living and postdoc salary is 0.39. The weighted correlation is 0.48. These are pretty modest. That means you can find a really good situation, or a really bad one (also, institution reputation matters, there are some gems which pay well and have great reputations from what I can tell!).

Also, **I’m pretty sure that the situation is worse than the numbers above suggest**. Looking at the list of universities it seems there’s a bias for institutions at high cost of living locations not to want to report their salary data I think. Aside from UCSB the whole UC system denied the attempt to get data, and I don’t see Stanford, Columbia, or Harvard on the list.

The full table is below the fold, but adjusted for cost of living UCSB postdocs get \$20,866 per year. In contrast, Michigan State, University of Maryland, Baltimore, and Wayne State University postdocs make more than \$60,000 per year when you adjust. Stanford isn’t on the list, but online it says Stanford postdocs make between the low \$50,000 to low \$60,000 range, which seems reasonable for life sciences, though definitely poverty wages where the university is located (though if you are in a lucrative field it can be more, and depending on your supervisor outside consulting is a possibility, though good luck living in Silicon Valley on a \$100,000 yearly gross income if you have a family, as many postdocs do).
