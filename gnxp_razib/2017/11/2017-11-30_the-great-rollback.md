The great rollback

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/discoverthenews.jpeg?resize=178%2C284)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/discoverthenews.jpeg?resize=178%2C284)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001F0RL6K/geneexpressio-20)Derek Thompson in *The Atlantic* has a piece up, [How to Survive the Media Apocalypse](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/media-apocalypse/546935/), which gets at something I’ve come to believe:

> Advertising has been critical to the affordable distribution of news > for a century and a half in the U.S. Today’s media companies don’t > have to reach all the way **back to the early 1800s** for a business > plan, to when newspapers were an elite product, selling at the > prohibitive price of six pennies per bundle. But they are going back > in time, in a way, **and excavating a dusty business model that relies > more on readers**, and less on advertisers, than the typical online > publisher….

There are two groups of people who as readers truly value the truth in anything but the workaday (e.g., weather, traffic reports, etc.): **nerds and those with money on the line.**

The idea that news is about giving people the Truth is a conceit that was never attainable, but the American media had aspirations. Really most people want to be entertained, amused and vindicated. Conservatives complaining about the perceived Leftward drift of *The New York Times* who cancel their subscriptions are accelerating an inevitable process (as the readership gets more and more liberal). The fat profits generated by **both** advertising, in particular classifieds, **and** subscriptions, allowed the 20th-century media to not be beholden to one master. This is a new world, though a generation that grew up in the old world has not internalized the now.

Facts will basically be a luxury consumption good, as well an inputnecessary for greater productivity on the margins for efficient allocation of capital. Those journals with mass audiences will fragment and develop sharper viewpoints and pay less attention to facts if they impede sensationalism and audience preferences. Basically, we’re going to become Britain!

Thompson’s reference back to the early 1800s made me think of [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0049P1YUW/geneexpressio-20). Like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Gauss did not have absolute leisure to pursue intellectual activities. At some point, he was employed as a surveyorin Hanover. To the modern mind, this was a terrible waste of incredible talent. It is for this sort of reason that institutions of higher education with some independence arose to give scholars leisure and freedom to pursue their interests.

But will it always be so? The science fiction genre of [steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) obtains its novelty from injecting advanced technology into a Victorian world on its own terms. Perhaps in a few decades, many of our social and cultural arrangements will seem very quaint and antiquated to those of us who came into maturity in the *fin de siècle* of the 20th century, with all culture was mass culture.
