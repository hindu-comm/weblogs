The Elephant, dragon and eagle

  
[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/indiachina.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/indiachina.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0757ZZS74/geneexpressio-20)The relationship between China and India is clearly one-sided: **India is obsessed with a China which is approaching lift-off toward becoming on the verge of a developed nation within a generation** (certain urban areas are already basically developed, albeit not particularly wealthy in comparison to Hong Kong or Singapore).

Often when I see interviews with regular Chinese about their opinions of the other country the fixation is upon the manifest Third World nature of India, which seems to be changing much more slowly than their own nation. For me GDP is less important that vital statistics like child mortality or life expectancy. And it is in these sorts of statistics where you see the gap opening up between the two nations. India is developing…. but China is leading, and converging faster with developed nations.

It is in this context that this piece in *The New York Times* jumped out at me, [Amazon, in Hunt for Lower Prices, Recruits Indian Merchants](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/26/technology/amazon-india-merchants.html?hpw&rref=technology&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=0):

I did not know that Amazon was so competitive in India, though [Flipkart](http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/flipkart-amazon-claim-huge-boost-from-festive-season-sales/story-93ONQr3x0y5iBonajTrH8I.html) is still dominant there.

The story outlined seems to be part of a bigger trend whereby India is on a very different path from China in its relationship to the rest of the world. China’s economy is big enough and insular enough that it sees the world as either an export market or a source of commodities. It is quickly taking back its place of old as a lumbering hegemon. India, in contrast, seems to be developing a more integrative relationship with large economies such as the United States, despite its command and regulatory economy legacy.

Of course, the India-USA relationship is nothing like “[Chimerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimerica)” in terms of magnitude, **but the Sino-American relationship strikes me as very transactional**. Despite the recent tendency of Indian society to espouse a stronger Hindu nationalist line, which is at odds with the West, it seems that there is more cultural exchange between elite Indians and Western societies in the deep sense of values, than has occurred with the Chinese and the West. And, yoga and aspects of spirituality notwithstanding, most of the cultural exchange seems to be toward cosmopolitan elites Indiansassimilating to global values which draw from the mode of the West.

Ultimately all of this seems to have geopolitical implications. I’m assuming smarter people than me are keeping track of these trends….
