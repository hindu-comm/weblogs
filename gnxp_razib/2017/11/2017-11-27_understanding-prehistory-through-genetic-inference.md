Understanding prehistory through genetic inference and ancient DNA

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/firstfarmers.jpeg?resize=187%2C269)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/firstfarmers.jpeg?resize=187%2C269)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000RGSUMM/geneexpressio-20)Before David Reich’s book, [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20), I highly recommend a new preprint from Pontus Skoglund and Iain Mathieson\*, [Ancient genomics: a new view into human prehistory and evolution](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddzg6q5e14dg6ad/Ancient%20Genomics.pdf).

It’s basically at the sweet spot for a lot of readers: **doesn’t overemphasize methods or archaeological minutiae that’s hard to follow.** That being said I do think you would benefit if you read two things which would complement in those directions, [First Farmers: The Origins of Agricultural Societies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000RGSUMM/geneexpressio-20), and [Ancient Admixture in Human History](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2012/09/06/genetics.112.145037).

\* I have to say, I consider Iain a friend, but am I the only one a bit perplexed by how a British person can have such a difficult to spell version of his name? I always have to look it up!
