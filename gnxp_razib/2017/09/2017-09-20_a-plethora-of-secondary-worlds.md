A plethora of secondary worlds

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wheel_of_the_infinite.jpeg?resize=175%2C287)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wheel_of_the_infinite.jpeg?resize=175%2C287)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005EC3IHG/geneexpressio-20)A short write-up, [Why build new worlds](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/fantasy-worlds-invention-restraint/?CMP=Sprkr-_-Editorial-_-TimesLiterarySupplement-_-ArtsandCulture-_-JustTextandlink-_-Statement-_-Unspecified-_-FBPAGE), which surveys the origins and of secondary creations such as Middle Earth.

One aspect of these attempts at world-building is the most detailed ones invariably borrow and reconfigure aspects of our own universe. This is obvious in [The Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20), and explicit in [The Lord of the Rings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007978OY6/geneexpressio-20), in which Tolkien was striving to create a mythology for the Anglo-Saxon peoples. Guy Gavriel Kay takes this tendency of drawing from our world to an extreme in works such as [Sailing to Sarantium](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00452V3DC/geneexpressio-20), which has numerous characters who are clearly modeled upon figures from our world’s history. Similarly, Kate Elliott’s [Crown of Stars](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AFXJKCG/geneexpressio-20) series is pretty obviously set in 10th century Germany. And she says so in the afterword of the first book if I recall correctly.

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ehiopiahistory.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ehiopiahistory.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003CN5QUQ/geneexpressio-20)But one aspect of this borrowing from our own world is that like Tolkien there is a focus on Northern European source material**. Since most of the buying public are probably white for English speaking fantasy that’s a reasonable choice. But sometimes you get an author who mines a whole different part of the world, and the result can be very fascinating. Martha Wells’ Wheels of the Infinite has issues with plotting and character development, but it’s imagining of a fantastical Angkor-like civilization is beautifully rendered.

If there is one area which I thought would be excellent source material for a secondary world, **it’s the highlands of Ethiopia**. I’d love to read fantasy which draws upon this land’s history, in a part because most people (including me) would not have as clear of a sense of who was based on someone real and the correspondence of events to those in our world’s history.
