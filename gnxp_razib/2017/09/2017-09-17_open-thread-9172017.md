The author has an apologia/explanation for why he is focusing not just on European colonialism, but the history of what became Vietnam back to the first contacts with Han China (with some perfunctory archaeological passages). This is great in theory, but from what I have read so far we’re going to have a tryst with the French sooner than later. So I don’t think he really delivered here (though perhaps “normal” people want to read about evil European colonialism immediately?).

One of my friends from when I was a kid had (has) a dad who was a Vietnam vet. He’d have night terrors. Only now do I realize how recently in the past it was for him back in the 1980s.

I did enjoy [The Best and the Brightest](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449908704/geneexpressio-20).

Sent out my second [newsletter](http://razib.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=68e76131336a8f29b88c5e5c9&id=4be5c128df). Here’s a stat that I divulged: more than 50% of traffic to this site is directly due to Google+Twitter+Facebook. In 2011 it was 35%. Much of the difference is due to the decline in RSS feeds, and the rise of mobile.

Why is Twitter not what it was in the early 2010s? I think part of it is that there are too many people on Twitter, and the average user is less intelligent overall. Unlike Facebook on Twitter the “genius” is anyone can talk to you. This is a problem.

I’m at peace with the likelihood that I won’t finish this series. Sanderson is a great world-builder, so I’m looking at these books more as fictional ethnographies. Just along for a short ride.

After the classical period I haven’t really enjoyed this book, it was a slog. I began to read it at the same time as I read [Consciousness and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DMCVXO0/geneexpressio-20), which I finished in a week. Two years on I’m finally finishing the other book I started then.

Finally, again I highlyrecommend [The Fortunes of Africa](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JZBA9M4/geneexpressio-20). Great read. I do have to say that it was hard not to be particularly appalled by Arab slave traders. It’s not like the European trade isn’t appalling, but that’s widely known. In contrast the driving of black Africans across the Sahara is less in the Western consciousness.
