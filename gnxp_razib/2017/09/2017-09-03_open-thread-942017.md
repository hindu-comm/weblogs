I found the above video through [Rod Dreher](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/). It touched me on a visceral level because the baby in the first portion looks strikingly like my youngest. He’s sitting and smiling so much now. Really appreciating his infant-hood, as this is the third time we’re going through this.

**All I can say in relation to having children is that now I know what matters, all that matters, and that none of the rest matters**.

They’re really compressing a lot of material into only a few episodes. I didn’t watch the earlier seasons before the show got ahead of the books, but I have to think they were more leisurely. I’ll watch the final season to get a sense of the ending in the books in case George R. R. Martin doesn’t finish them, but I think the sprint to the finish line means that if he does write the remaining books he’ll have a lot of free territory to himself.

The fact that Westerners don’t know who Mencius is (a premise of the piece) is ridiculous. But probably true. I would still recommend [Xunzi: The Complete Text](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M/geneexpressio-20) for another early Confucian viewpoint.

I added a [disclosures](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/disclosures/) page. Mostly all that matters right now is that I work at [Insitome](https://insito.me/), trying to do interesting things in the personal genomics space (and now that the Helix store is open you can [purchase our first offering](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal/)).

I’m seeing more and more despondency on the nature of Twitter from the people who use it the most and produce the vast majority of the content. I suspect it will collapse sooner than later….

[The Looming Decline of the Public Research University](http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober-2017/the-looming-decline-of-the-public-research-university/). As someone with intellectual aspirations but a conservative political viewpoint I’m conflicted. On the one hand the academy produces great work. On the other hand a lot of academics don’t see a difference between someone like me and Nazis (judging by “likes” of things I’ve retweeted to test the waters in relation to those promoting the proposition). Like it or not many conservatives perceive that a subset of the academy is dangerous to us on existential grounds. Why should we pay for our own destruction? If we could surgically remove these departments then the university could maintain itself, but that seems impossible. So you see where the future leads.

[The Best DNA Ancestry Testing Kit](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dna-ancestry-testing-kit/). There is some good and some bad in this review. But it’s thorough.

Fun fact, 44% of this site’s traffic is now mobile.
