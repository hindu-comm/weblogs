As many Americans think the Bible is a book of fables as that it is the literal word of God

Basically as a society develops and modernizes it becomes more secular. At least that’s the model.

In the 1980s Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge wrote [The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival and Cult Formation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520057317/geneexpressio-20). Stark and Bainbridge’s work was predominantly empirical; they looked at survey data to present a model of the American religious landscape. But they also had a theoretical framework, whereby religion was modeled with a rational choice framework on the individual religion, anddenominations and sects were viewed as “firms” providing “goods and services” to “customers.”

Larry Witham’s [Marketplace of the Gods: How Economics Explains Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195394755/geneexpressio-20) surveys the various scholars in this discipline. I’ve read the book, **and what I will say is that like many imperial ventures, this one failed.** The predictions of the “supply-side” model of religion haven’t panned out.

In 2004 Samuel Huntingtonwrote in [Who Are We?](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684870541/geneexpressio-20) that the United States likely had a*more*Christian future than the present. He was actually writing this as a massive wave of secularization was going on in the United States; the second since that of the 1960s had abated.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/putnam_american_grace.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/putnam_american_grace.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003UV8TEA/geneexpressio-20)For a long time, people were in denial about this. After all the United States had been the great exception to the secularization trend in the developed world. Their priors were strong. And the market also provided what consumers wanted; books such as [God is Back](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143116835/geneexpressio-20) and [Jesus in Beijing](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007NJCG62/geneexpressio-20) catered to the demand. Writing in the early 2000s the author of[Jesus in Beijing](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007NJCG62/geneexpressio-20)suggested that 20 to 30 percent of China would be Christian two to three decades, so between 2023 and 2033 (from the publication of the book). Credible [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_China#Statistics) in 2017 put the current number of Christians in China at 2 to 5 percent.

In 2009 I took John Tierney of *The New York Times* [to task](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2009/11/19/fake-fact-america-is-not-secularizing/)for dismissing the secularization hypothesis in a column. I emailed him my blog post, and he denied that it showed what it showed. Today I suspect he’d admit that I was more right than he was.

Today everyone is talking about the Pew [survey](https://www.prri.org/research/american-religious-landscape-christian-religiously-unaffiliated/) which shows the marginalization of the Anglo-Protestant America which I grew up in. This marginalization is due to secularization broadly, and non-Hispanic whites in particular. You don’t need Pew to tell you this.

At the top of this post you see the response to the GSS query BIBLE, which asks respondents how they view the Bible in relation to whether it is God’s literal word, inspired word, or a book of fables. I limited the data to non-Hispanic whites. In 2016 as many people viewed the Bible as a book of fables as the word of God. In 2000 twice as many people viewed it as the word of God as a book of fables. That is a huge change.

**Note:** Robert Putnam’s [American Grace](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003UV8TEA/geneexpressio-20) is probably the best book which highlights the complex cultural forces which ushered in the second wave of secularization. The short answer is that the culture wars diminished Christianity in the eyes of liberals.
