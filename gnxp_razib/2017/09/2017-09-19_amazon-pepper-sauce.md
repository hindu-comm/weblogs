Amazon pepper sauce

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Amazon_Green_167ml_BS.jpg?resize=150%2C397)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Amazon_Green_167ml_BS.jpg?resize=150%2C397)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MSZGPZ6/geneexpressio-20)Something different today when it comes to the condiment of choice. So I’m privileged to work at a [company](insito.me) where the boss adds different hot sauces to our [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/store/h-e-b/storefront) orders for the office. So we get to sample the good with the bad (usually not bad, just not exceptional).

You stumble upon some real gems in that way. The [Green Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MSZGPZ6/geneexpressio-20) pepper sauce isn’t the hottest that’s graced my palette by a long-shot, though it packs more of a punch than tabasco. **But its tart pungency gives you a huge wallop**. Think the pepperoncinis you used to get with pizza or in antipasto. But livelier and spicier.

Overall a definite keeper,[Green Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MSZGPZ6/geneexpressio-20)is literally flavorful, with tang and spiciness, and a bit of savor as well.
