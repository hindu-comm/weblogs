So far a little too heavy on diplomatic as opposed to social history. My curiosity was piqued when reading [The Fortunes of Africa](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JZBA9M4/geneexpressio-20) when the author observed that the geopolitical extend of the modern Ethiopian state was partially a function of a relativelylate state expansion in the 19t and 20th centuries from the Abyssinian highlands.

It’s one of those facts which allow other facts to snap into place. I’ve always been curious about the huge number of Muslims and Somalis in modern Ethiopia. Well, it turns out to be a function of the fact that the borders were drawn at a particular moment and time.

[Neolithization of North Africa involved the migration of people from both the Levant and Europe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/21/191569).

A stray thought I had. For years people have been wary about Richard Dawkins’ conflation of atheism with science, and evolutionmore particularly. I am starting to wonder if the more self-conscious political activism of scientists, almost uniformly on the Left, will start to have an impact.

The problem is that at for now scientists depend on the public for their funding by and large (there are exceptions obviously). A polarized public which does not esteem science and has a faction which sees it as hostile may be less interested in cutting checks for “blue sky” projects (i.e., NIH will be fine, but the NSF….). Since academics are overwhelming of one political orientation I suspect they have a poor intuition of how quickly such a change could come about (there is more real diversity there than is vocalized, but many people I know personally have no inclination for public denunciations due to any heterodoxy, so they keep their mouths shut).

Going to the ASHG [meeting](http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/) in one month. I doubt I will venture out into Orlando. I have been to a conference in that city before, but never left the convention center attached to the airport! Am I missing something?

In general, I avoid national politics. But the whole controversy around football is curious **because I’m skeptical that the sport will be around in a generation**.

One thing that I have been thinking recently is dropping my Twitter follow back down to 300 or so. I still use Twitter obviously…but it’s getting too dumb. And lots of interesting and smart voices are going passively into lurk mode because it’s exhausting having to deal with dumb people.
