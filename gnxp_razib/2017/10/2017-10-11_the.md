The architecture of skin color variation in Africa

![Baby of hunter-gatherers in Southern Africa](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/khoisan.jpg?resize=200%2C236)

Very interesting abstract at the ASHG meeting of a plenary presentation,Novel loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations. This is clearly the work that one of the [comments](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/07/09/slc24a5-is-very-important-but-we-dont-know-why/#comment-2841) on this weblog alluded to last summer during SMBE. There I was talking about the likely introduction of the derived *SLC24A5*variant to the Khoisan peoples and its positive selection in peoples in southern Africa.

Below is the abstract in full. Those who follow the literature on this see the usual suspects in relation to genes, but also new ones:

> Despite the wide range of variation in skin pigmentation in Africans, > little is known about its genetic basis. To investigate this question > we performed a GWAS on pigmentation in 1,593 Africans from populations > in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Botswana. We identify significantly > associated loci in or > near*SLC24A5*,*MFSD12*,*TMEM138…OCA2*and*HERC2*. Allele > frequencies at these loci in global populations are strongly > correlated with UV exposure. At*SLC24A5*we find that a > non-synonymous mutation associated with depigmentation in non-Africans > was introduced into East Africa by gene flow, and subsequently rose to > high frequency. **At*MFSD12,*we identify novel variants that are > strongly correlated with dark pigmentation in populations with > Nilo-Saharan ancestry**. Functional assays reveal that*MFSD12*codes > for a lysosomal protein that influences pigmentation in cultured > melanocytes, zebrafish and mice. CRISPR knockouts of > murine*Mfsd12*display reduced pheomelanin pigmentation similar to > the grizzled mouse mutant (gr/gr). Exome sequencing of gr/gr mice > identified a 9 bp in-frame deletion in exon two of*Mfsd12*. Thus, > using human GWAS data we were able to map a classic mouse pigmentation > mutant. At*TMEM138…*we identify mutations in melanocyte-specific > regulatory regions associated with expression of UV response genes. > Variants associated with light pigmentation at this locus show > evidence of a selective sweep in Eurasians. At*OCA2*and*HERC2*we > identify novel variants associated with pigmentation and > at*OCA2,*the oculocutaneous albinism II gene, we find evidence for > **balancing selection maintaining alleles** associated with both light > and dark skin pigmentation. We observe at **all loci that variants > associated with dark pigmentation in African populations are identical > by descent in southern Asian and Australo-Melanesian populations** and > did not arise due to convergent evolution. Further, the alleles > associated with skin pigmentation at all loci but*SLC24A5*are > ancient, predating the origin of modern humans. **The ancestral > alleles at the majority of predicted causal SNPs are associated with > light skin, raising the possibility that the ancestors of modern > humans could have had relatively light skin color, as is observed in > the San population today**. This study sheds new light on the > evolutionary history of pigmentation in humans.

Looking at patterns of variation around pigmentation loci researchers suggested years ago that **Melanesians and Africans exhibited evidence of similarity and functional constraint.** That is, the dark skin alleles date back to Africa and did not deviate from their state due to selection pressures. In contrast, light skin alleles in places like eastern and western Eurasia are quite different.

This abstract also confirms something I said in a comment on the same thread, that Nilotic peoples are the ones likely to have been subject to selection for dark skin in the last 10,000 years. You see above that variants on*MFSD12*are correlated with dark complexion. In particular, in Nilo-Saharan groups. The model Nyakim Gatwech is of South Sudanese nationality and has a social media account famous for spotlighting her dark skin. In comparison to the Gatwech and the San Bushman child above are so different in color that I think it would be clear these two individuals come from very distinct populations.

The fascinating element of this abstract is the finding that most of thealleles which are correlated with lighter skin are very ancient and that they are the ancestral alleles more often than the derived! We’ll have to wait until the paper comes out. My assumption is that after the presentation*Science* will put it on their website. But until then here are some comments:

- There is obviously a bias in the studies of pigmentation toward those
  which highlight European variability. - The theory of balancing selection makes sense to me because ancient
  DNA is showing OCA2 “blue eye” alleles which are not ancestral in
  places outside of Western Europe. And in East Asia there their own
  variants. - Lots of variance in pigmentation not accounted for in mixed
  populations (again, lots of the early genomic studies focused on
  populations which were highly diverged and had nearly fixed
  differences). Presumably, African research will pick a lot of this up. - This also should make us skeptical of the idea that Western Europeans
  were necessarily very dark skinned, as now we know that human
  pigmentation architecture is complex enough that sampling modern
  populations expand our understanding a great deal. - Finally, it’s long been assumed that at some stage early on humans
  were light skinned on most of their body because we had fur. When we
  lost our fur is when we would need to have developed dark skin. This
  abstract is not clear at how far long ago light and dark alleles
  coalesce to common ancestors.
