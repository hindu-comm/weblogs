The four modes of atheism

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bigGods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bigGods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20)I have mentioned [Big Gods: How Religion Transformed Cooperation and Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20) before. It’s worth reading. I’d describe it as a cross between [In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058RTMXG/geneexpressio-20) and [Ultrasociety: How 10,000 Years of War Made Humans the Greatest Cooperators on Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0185P69LU/geneexpressio-20). Of course, that means I’m not sure I got the maximal utility from reading it since it leans on so much that I already internalized. But it’s a great introduction to the modern scientific study of religion.

But there was one aspect which I found rathernovel, because it introduced new data to me. In particular, the author tackled the origin of atheism, and why it might vary as a function of location and time.

There are four causes of atheism that are surveyed in [Big Gods](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20):

1\) Personality (low social intelligence)  
2) Hyper-analytic cognitive style  
3) Societal apathy toward religion  
4) Lack of strong modeling of religiosity

There has long been a hypothesis that those with lower social intelligence or weaker in ‘theory of mind’ have a more difficult time to find personal gods plausible. In short, theism depends on a relatively normal theory of mind. Looking at people on the autism spectrum who recounted their ideas of religion and god the author confirmed the intuition. Autistic individuals tended to be less religious, and, if religious, presented a model of God that was often highly impersonal and abstract.

One issue that is important to highlight here: I suspect that many great theological “truths” actually derive from individuals who engage in excessive intellectualism around the idea of god. For the average human applying formal logic to theism is probably besidethe point, though these sorts of religious intellectuals loom large in the books because…they are the ones writing the books.

This relates to the second issue. The author and his colleagues did research where they primed individuals by engaging them in highly analytic thought. Correcting for background variables they found that this biased respondents toward an impersonal god or atheism appreciably. Again, **I think it gets to the fact that for most humans supernatural beliefs are about the synthesis of intuitions and passions**. Excessive intellectualization is more likely to engender skepticism, or, a hyper-formal model of religion (which I think has become religion*qua*religion for some).

In Phil Zuckerman’s[Society Without God](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0029VCUVK/geneexpressio-20)he observes that in highly secular Scandinavia many respondents found it difficult to articulate strong feelings toward religion. It was simply not a prominent social institution in the society, though it was still part of the cultural furniture. But like furniture, it didn’t stand out. Societies with strong states, robust institutions, and impartial rule of law, along with some modicum of prosperity, tend to have lower levels of religiosity, and weaker passions about the topic from respondents. Once religiosity becomes less salient in a broad sense, then it becomes less of a concern in general for individuals.

A separate dynamic is that once people stop acting in a way that indicates that religion is important and true, others who take social cues begin to internalize this as evidence that religion isn’t that important. The authors give the example that there is social science that people who are raised Christian by parents who don’t go to church are far more likely to leave Christianity as adults because their parents did not credibly signal that religion was actually important enough to sacrifice any time and effort for. Perhaps another example which works as an analogy is that the vast majority of the children of interfaith Jewish-Christian marriages who were raised as Jews end up marrying non-Jews.

I think the first two factors in the list above explain the low but consistent basal rate of atheists and heterodox thinkers across history. One thousand years ago in Syria the poet [Al-Ma’arri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%CA%BFarri)made statements such as below:

> Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true; they are all > fabrications. Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life. > The sacred books are only such a set of idle tales as any age could > have and indeed did actually produce.

Al-Ma’arri was a brilliant eccentric, so he was tolerated. Some of his quips prefigure H. L. Mencken’s, as when he said that “The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains.”

The United States was long the exception to this trend, but as recounted in books such as [American Grace](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003UV8TEA/geneexpressio-20), it seems that secularization is starting to have its impact on the United States as well. Basically, as social norms shift to relax incentives toward being religious, more marginal believers will start expressing irreligiosity. At some point, some will start to*conform*to irreligiosity.

Of course, this sort of secularization is fragile. Aside from the sorts of demographic arguments made in [Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004DL0OCG/geneexpressio-20), examples such as post-Soviet Russia (and the post-Soviet nation-states more generally), as well as the progressively more religious nature of the Baathist resistance to American occupation in Iraq, illustrate that religion can bounce back rather fast, even within a generation or severl years. The social contexts for this resurgence are outlined in the book, **but they illustrate that in some ways secularization is a thin culturally conditioned dusting atop a religious cognitive substrate.**
