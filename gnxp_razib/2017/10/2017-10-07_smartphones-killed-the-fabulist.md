Smartphones killed the fabulist

![EVIL!!!](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/evil.jpeg?resize=200%2C402)

In *The Wall Street Journal* Nicholas Carr has a bizarre but unsurprising op-ed, [How Smartphones Hijack Our Minds:  
Research suggests that as the brain grows dependent on phone technology, the intellect weakens](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-smartphones-hijack-our-minds-1507307811). By the title, you can immediately pick out tells that should induce skepticism. “Research suggests” is usually indicating that the author has a hypothesis, and they went and searched the literature for research that confirmed their hypothesis. Carr actually did better than much of modern journalism. He found peer-reviewed literature, instead of quote mining, or selective elisions. **Journalism, you have a story to tell, and you’ll make someone else tell it!**

And to his credit, Carr cites the publications transparently, with links. Unfortunately, you see that in some cases the sample sizes are very small, and the statistical significance is marginal. In other instances, it doesn’t seem like there’s any real causality. One can’t know if there is a confound with who decides to take phones to class and who does not. It may be that those students who are very focused simply don’t take their phones. Finally, a lot of the research cited in the piece looks like it was sliced and diced to me.

Traditionalists have inveighed against new information technologies for the whole history of the human race. No doubt when complex syntax emerged some spoiled-sport argued that it wasbeing abused to gossip and waste time.

Most peopleknow that some of the ancient Greeks worried that the spread of literacy was eroding the power of memory. Less well known is that the printing press helped usher in the final decline of the [art of memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_memory).

And literacy does rewire our brains. In[Reading in the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143118056/geneexpressio-20) Stanislas Dehaene outlines just how certain regions of the brain focused on shape perception are co-opted to recognize letters effortlessly. This may not be without cost. Muhammed Ali was semi-literate, in part due to dyslexia, and a recent [biographer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N9HDV49/geneexpressio-20) has argued that he had better visual-spatial abilities in part because he didn’t waste his attention and focus on learning to read instinctively.

He knows exactly how to write viral stories which travel on the internet by criticizing the internet.

And it is certainly hard to deny the distracting effect of the internet. But that’s looking at the glass half-empty. **One of the positives of the ubiquity of smartphones is that it has forced the retirement of so many bullshitters**. Today people can make something up, and you can just “look it up.” Everyone is fact-checking everyone, and distracting from the fabulous bullshit stories and “facts” that a certain type of person has always specialized in.

Like free trade, it’s easy to see the downsides of the internet, and mine the social science literature to “prove” that you’re right. That’s one of the benefits of the internet, it lets you find scientific research which can confirm any assertion you make under heaven. Carr’s leveraging the literature to service his likely false arguments is one of the internet’s downsides.
