Apes just being apes

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/thenakebonobo.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/thenakebonobo.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01C3AQFOE/geneexpressio-20)A while back I made fun of bonobos and chimpanzees for being kind of losers for looking across at each other on either side of the Congo river for \~1.5 million years the time elapsed since their diversion. I finally ended up reading the paper from last year, [Chimpanzee genomic diversity reveals ancient admixture with bonobos](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6311/477), which reported complex population history between these two species. In other words, “they got it on”.

The key was a reasonable sample size of N=40 and high coverage genomes (\>20x), to give them the amount of information necessary to have the power to detect admixture. If you aren’t human and have a reasonable size genome, and all mammals do, get to the back of the line. But the*Pan*‘s turn finally arrived.

The paper![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/F3.large_.jpg?resize=325%2C264)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/F3.large_.jpg?resize=325%2C264)primary result is that over past few hundred thousand years there have been reciprocal gene flow events of small, but detectable, magnitude between chimpanzees and bonobos. Naturally, there was some geographic specificity here, in that chimpanzees from far West Africa lack much evidence of this while those from Central Africa have a great deal. The admixture is directly proportional to proximity to b0nobo range.

To obtain the result their initial focus on high-frequency bonobo derived alleles that were at low to moderate frequencies in chimpanzees. There was a notable excess for this class among Central African chimpanzees. And, these alleles seem to have introgressed recently.

I suppose the major takeway is that hominids do it like they do it on the Discovery Channel.
