Happy Labor Day! (to Americans)

[![download](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/download2-127x150.jpg?resize=127%2C150)![download](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/download2-127x150.jpg?resize=127%2C150)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1429229438/geneexpressio-20)A few days ago someone asked about books on genetics. More specifically, textbooks. I didn’t know what to say really, because “genetics” is a big field. Genetics on the evolutionary/population scale is a rather abstract field of analysis. Genetics in the molecular sense is a concrete physical science. For my qualifying exam I went with [Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1429229438/geneexpressio-20). Though the title emphasizes the classical genetic analytic framework (i.e., Mendelism as formulated in the early 20th century), there is coverage of fields as diverse as quantitative genetics and genomics. I particularly liked the deep treatment of meiosis, in both its biophysical and analytic dimension. For molecular genetics, I can’t complain about [Molecular Biology of the Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321762436/geneexpressio-20), though people who actually do molecular biology would have an opinion you might want to listen to. At the other end of the spectrum [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) is the easy choice. Though I really like [Elements of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20), at least the parts I’ve had time to work through.
