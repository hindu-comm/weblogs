On “anonymous” comments, etc.

Just a minor administrative note. I now have some power to have pre-approved comments. That means if you don’t change your name/email/IP your comments are going to go through even if I don’t approve them. The only catch is that it works via a script which runs only every hour, so there’s some latency. Second, **I am going to ask people to use *pseudonyms* rather than just “anonymous.”** It makes it hard to keep track of who is saying what. From now on I’m just not going to publish anonymous comments.

**Update:** OK, heard from the top that the auto-approval script will be set to run every time the page loads soon. So there won’t be a latency.
