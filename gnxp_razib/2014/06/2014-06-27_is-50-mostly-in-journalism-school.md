Is 50% “mostly” in journalism school?

[Steve](http://www.unz.com/isteve/white-men-at-it-again/?utm_source=feedly&utm_reader=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=white-men-at-it-again) has a post up on a paint-by-the-numbers story, one of many coming out in the media about how white and male the workforce in Silicon Valley is. The latter is moderately true. The former seems pretty obviously false. The main issue is that the diversity isn’t the [the right kind of diversity](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/29/how-the-asians-became-white/). OK, whatever. But when I click through to the [original piece](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/25/facebook-diversity/11369019/) an infographic on Yahoo! pops up first. What really confuses me is how **you can state a workforce is “mostly white” when only 50% of the workforce is white.** Can mostly be the same as one out of two? To me the [connotation](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mostly) of mostly is at least a substantial majority, but at minimum it seems you should crest 50 percent. Then again, I didn’t go to journalism school, so I could be wrong. English is the second language I learned.
