Short interview with me on [NPR’s Sunday Weekend Edition](http://www.npr.org/2014/06/29/326669395/curious-father-decodes-his-sons-dna) about my son’s whole-genome sequence. It’s edited down from 10 minutes of tape. Nothing new to readers of this weblog, some of whom may be as underwhelmed as my son.
