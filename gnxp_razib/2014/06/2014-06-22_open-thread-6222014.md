Open Thread, 6/22/2014

If you go down the right sidebar you will now see new widgets in addition to the recent comments. In particular the bottom of the sidebar how has a custom widget, so I can add things like “books” and “blogroll.” People who can make pre-approved comments should now be seeing them come up more quickly.
