I doubt the ancestors of the Khoisan were ever the most numerous human population on this planet

![Adapted from *Khoisan hunter-gatherers have been the largest population throughout most of modern-human demographic history*](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ncomms6692-f31.jpg?resize=501%2C317)

It is common for strong results from population genetics to be confused when it is translated for public consumption. The best example is that of “mtDNA Eve.” Despite the big warning label that mtDNA Eve is one of **many** female ancestors, the public has gained the impression that she is *the* female ancestor. A similar problem is cropping up with the [Khoisan paper](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-least-bottlenecked-humans-of-all/) which reports that they went through a relatively mild bottleneck in comparison to other modern human populations. There’s a reason I titled the post *The Least Bottlenecked Humans of All*. It’s a defensible reduction of the results. In contrast many popular treatments are translating the results into the conclusion that “the Khoisan had the largest population of all human groups at some point in the past.” The reason I avoided this formulation is that plainly stated I doubt that at any time the Khoisan as we understand them, a genetically-culturally coherent group in southern Africa, had the largest population of all. Humans of various sorts have been common across Afro-Eurasia for over a million years. Is it plausible that ancestors of the Khoisan had the largest populations of all? Anne Gibbon’s somewhat cautiously stated piece in *Science*, [Dwindling African tribe may have been most populous group on planet](http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/12/dwindling-african-tribe-may-have-been-most-populous-group-planet), relays the sentiment which I share:

The biggest gap in the current study **is that many extinct lineages were *not* included.** Obviously they couldn’t be included, because they’re extinct, though at some point in the future ancient DNA or (more likely in the African context) reconstruction of ancient genomes from extant populations which have absorbed them, might allow for a better understanding of Pleistocene human population sizes. Population genomics is powerful, **but it has limits.** We need to be cautious about assuming that what we can illuminate with current methods is all that can be conceived in our natural philosophy.
