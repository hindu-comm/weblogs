Genome sequencing of newborns

This is coming, [Genome Sequencing in Babies to Begin as Part of Study](http://www.wsj.com/articles/genome-sequencing-in-babies-to-begin-as-part-of-study-1419896152), with high risk cases first:

Right now I agree that the benefits for sequencing high risk newborns seems much more obvious than for healthy infants. But it’s just a matter of time that longitudinal studies will want to include healthy infants, who after all have varying degrees of later-in-life risks with heritable components. Speaking of which:

This is a common objection. But the issue really isn’t new, it began when people developed tests for Huntington’s disease. What’s the benefit in knowing your child is highly likely to develop a fatal disease by the time they’re 50 for which there is no viable cure for? It’s a matter of choice, **but it strikes me that knowing your risk of dying at a particular time would change your life calculations a great deal.** Many people live full lives by the time they’re 50.
