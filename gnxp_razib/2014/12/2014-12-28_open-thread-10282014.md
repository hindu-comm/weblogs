A bit theory poor, but data rich. Much more readable than [Bernard Baylin’s works](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=bernard%20baylin&sprefix=bernard+bay%2Cstripbooks%2C343). I don’t recommend it enough, and I should reread it someday (though it’s got a big queue ahead of it). Also, Kevin Phillips’ [The Cousins’ Wars: Religion, Politics, Civil Warfare, And The Triumph Of Anglo-America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013708/geneexpressio-20/) is excellent. I avoided it for a long while because Phillips had a history as a political operative, so I thought it would be superficial. I was very wrong.

In the [post below](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/theyre-not-a-gym/) on *Planet Fitness* my wife thought that I was going to mention that I’ve gotten a bit obnoxious and insufferable about working out. About 6 months ago I decided to make a life change, and now I lift and run 5 miles 2 out of 3 days. It’s gotten extreme enough that before travel I check to see if the hotel has weights, or if there’s a good gym nearby (here in Palm Springs, where I’ll be when this post goes up, that isn’t hard). My goal is lose some fat and gain some muscles. The latter is pretty much one, I’m just working on definition now. As for the fat, I still have some work to do around my stomach though it’s getting much better (I don’t really have appreciable fat elsewhere, such as [moobs](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=moobs)).

I’m curious what readers who have a fitness regime do. For example, what do you think about protein shakes? I did creatine for a bit, but I don’t want to get totally jacked so I stopped. Running before or after lifting? I seem to feel much better running after I lift. What works for you in terms of diet?
