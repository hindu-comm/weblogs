Men have been more pro-choice over the past 30 years

![abany2](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/abany2-300x282.jpg?resize=300%2C282)![abany2](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/abany2-300x282.jpg?resize=300%2C282)One of the weird things that annoys me about American politics is the idea that **support for abortion rights is particular in some way to women.** This is very common on the Left side of the political spectrum, but strangely for the self-described “reality based community” it has basically no correspondence with reality at the first pass.\* All you need to do is look at the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/analysis/?dataset=gss12), which as a variable “ABANY” which asks respondents if it should be legal for a woman to have an abortion for any reason. The question has been asked every few years since 1977. I limited the data to whites only, and what you can see above is that year to year there is actually a correlation between men and women when it came to a “Yes” response. I was actually surprised by that. The jumps are not total noise, but reflect changes in the *Zeitgeist* (the rule of thumb is that the populace becomes more pro-choice during Republican presidencies and more pro-life during Democratic ones).

The second plot illustrates that **for most of the years since 1977 men have supported abortion on demand at a higher clip than women.** It doesn’t prove anything, except that reality is a little more “problematic” than some people who regularly call in to NPR might think (that’s what triggered this post).

\* If you look close, there is evidence that a smaller well educated segment of liberal women are particularly intense about abortion rights.
