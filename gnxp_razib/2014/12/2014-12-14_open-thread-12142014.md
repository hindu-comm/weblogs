But I still feel that I was a bit narrow. Over the years my interest in science has become rather narrow because of professional focus, but when I was younger I used to read quite a bit of popular physics, such as John Gribbin’s [In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004JN1CIS/geneexpressio-20). This sort of narrowing of focus is probably inevitable, but still pretty worrying for me. Probably the last popular physics book which I read front to back was Lee Smolin’s [The Trouble With Physics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003WUYP56/geneexpressio-20), nearly 8 years ago.

In other news, I’m going to try and take a break from the internet for a few days around the New Year. More precisely, I’m going to try and take a *vacation* with my growing family somewhere sunny and hopefully warm. We’ll see how that works out. But please don’t be concerned if I don’t post on Twitter or have a blog update for a few days +/- January 1st of 2015.
