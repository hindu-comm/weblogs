Please update links/bookmarks to my new location

Just a request to readers who have blogs: **please update your links to this new website (<http://www.unz.com/gnxp>)**. I’ve noticed that there are very few referrals to other websites coming in right now, though plenty of people are coming in via my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan) account. Also, if you subscribe via RSS please point to<http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed>. That’s the easiest way to get all my content. Thanks.
