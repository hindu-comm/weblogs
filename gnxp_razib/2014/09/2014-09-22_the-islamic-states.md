The Islamic States

![“Chop-chop square” in Riyadh](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dira_Square-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200)

Like [Joe Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgazmo), the Mormon missionary who becomes involved in the porn industry in the late 90s film [Orgazmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgazmo), our involvement in the Mid-East is probably going to result in the violation of our purity (yes, that’s only in our self-conception as a nation; we’re mostly definitely only born-again virgins, not the real deal). It’s hard to read anything about the Free Syrian Army which portrays it as anything but hapless, disorganized, if often well meaning and milquetoast (well, when they’re not allying with the Nusra Front and being nasty to Alawites and Christians who support the regime which has been nasty to them). And of course this edition of the coalition of the willing involves our stalwart Western-leaning allies, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Yes, Bahrain, the sectarian regime dominated by a religious minority which suppresses the majority with [foreign forces](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/07/2011725145048574888.html). Qatar, the Islamists’ number one ally in the Muslim world. The UAE, which is home to the dystopian techno-oligarchy that is Dubai, a glittering vision of the apotheosis of slaverycoexistent with post-modernity. And of course there is Saudi Arabia, the only nation in the world which regularly decapitates individuals for capital crimes. Well, except of course the Islamic State if you count that as a state!

I won’t belabor the point. Let’s remember that the Saudi monarchy is quite notably medieval in its practices and institutional arrangement (it abolished slavery in the 1962). Our enemies, Iran, and the Syrian regime, are actually much closer to modernity as we’d understand it using the Saudis as the extreme case. As it is we have to ignore this because the Saudis are our bastards, neo-feudal creeps though they may be. **And we’re trusting them to help train the Free Syrian Army?** Of the 19 9/11 hijackers [15 were Saudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijackers_in_the_September_11_attacks#Background) (a further two were from the UAE, our ally). This is not going to end well. We can’t admit that we’re helping the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Yes, he’s a murdering bastard, **but he’s not *our* bastard.**

The Islamic State is a nasty piece of work. Unlike Saddam Hussein’s late lamented dictatorship it also has the ability and ambitions to spread its tentacles of nastiness across the region right now. I won’t shed any tears over the pounding Raqqa is receiving from American cruise missiles. **But let’s beclear that almost certainly this is going to benefit our Iranian enemies, as well as Hezbollah.** Additionally, the Saudis and their Gulf allies will probably attempt to reshape the Sunni insurgency in their own image, which is not one which we in the West would term “moderate,” let alone free. Let’s go into this with eyes open, and acknowledge that it’s a choice between a bad option, and a worse option.

**Shorter:** America is on the side of the *less* evil guys. Go America! Also see this *cri du coeur*, [The Barbarians Within Our Gates](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/09/the-barbarians-within-our-gates-111116.html#.VCDuGnVdVoA).
