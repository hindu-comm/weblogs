The real Gattaca

[![logo](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/logo.gif?resize=201%2C37)![logo](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/logo.gif?resize=201%2C37)](http://www.innocenceproject.org/)There’s a specter haunting genetics, and that’s [Gattaca](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000I8G5B2/geneexpressio-20). The 1997 film comes up constantly whenever someone is doing something with genetics which might be pushing the envelope. But what world do we live in? We live in a world of the [Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act). More importantly, we live in the world of the [Innocence Project](http://www.innocenceproject.org/). This enterprise is so well known that we don’t even blink an eye, **but what they’re doing is applying genetics.** This came to my mind because of the most recent case of [two men exonerated of rape and murder](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/opinion/the-innocent-on-death-row.html?_r=0) (they were on death row). And if you think being railroaded like this only happens to low IQ and socially advantaged individuals, see the [Michael Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Morton_(criminal_justice)) case. Think applied genetics is scary? Imagine a world without it!
