Open Thread, 9/7/2014

I have to say, I disagree with President Obama on a lot of things, especially domestic policy. But I’m really glad that he’s taking his time on figuring out how to respond to ISIS. In foreign policy I think his instincts are better for our nation, even if the Establishment is displeased with the timidity. They won’t be sending their sons over to fight, it’s all a game of Risk for them.
