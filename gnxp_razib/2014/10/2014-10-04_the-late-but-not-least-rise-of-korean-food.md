The late but not least rise of Korean food

[![220px-Gimchi](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/220px-Gimchi.jpg?resize=220%2C165)![220px-Gimchi](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/220px-Gimchi.jpg?resize=220%2C165)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi#mediaviewer/File:Gimchi.jpg)When I went to New York last month I was **very excited** to be eating some Korean in mid-town with some friends. It’s probably my favorite cuisine overall at this point in my life, and has been for a few years. *Serious Eats* has an interesting article up on how it’s become so trendy, [How Korean Cuisine Got Huge in America (And Why It Took So Long)](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/how-korean-cuisine-got-huge-in-america.html). [![220px-Korean_barbeque-Galbi-02](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/220px-Korean_barbeque-Galbi-02-150x112.jpg?resize=150%2C112)![220px-Korean_barbeque-Galbi-02](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/220px-Korean_barbeque-Galbi-02-150x112.jpg?resize=150%2C112)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_barbecue#mediaviewer/File:Korean_barbeque-Galbi-02.jpg)One thing I would want to note is that **I’ve been told by friends that Korean cuisine does have some serious regional variation.** So we should perhaps be a little cautious about bracketing it all into one class. The seafood inflected fare of Busan is different from what you’ll find further north. I suspect my love of Korean cuisine is due to its very strong flavors. As someone who has something of a hot sauce addiction that’s the sort of thing I crave.
