Why I’m not signing up for Kindle Unlimited

[![O2-slate-04-lg-apps](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/O2-slate-04-lg-apps-300x289.jpg?resize=300%2C289)![O2-slate-04-lg-apps](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/O2-slate-04-lg-apps-300x289.jpg?resize=300%2C289)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CU0NSCU/geneexpressio-20)My household has three [Kindle Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CU0NSCU/geneexpressio-20) tablets (two of them HD). Obviously they are used for things besides reading books, but the main reason for their purchase was as text delivery devices. If I an extra house to store physical books and a manservant of some sort to manage the collection, I would be very happy with “dead tree.” I had a professor years ago who admitted he had an extra house which he ended up filling with his enormous book collection, to the annoyance of his wife. I can’t imagine being in that situation, but my “book habit” was getting out of control by the middle years of the 2000s. Moving was starting to become a major chore which I dreaded because of the boxes of books. And I don’t miss lugging around large numbers of books when I’m going on a road trip. I am well aware that there are unintended downsides to signing on to the e-book revolution, and Amazon in particular. But the convenience factor is just too high. And yes, I’m a pretty big user of [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DBYBNEE/geneexpressio-20); I never liked physical shopping.

So I was curious when Amazon launched a subscription book service. *The New York Times* reviews the pro’s and con’s,[Amazon Unveils E-Book Subscription Service, With Some Notable Absences](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/business/media/amazon-introduces-kindle-subscription-service.html?_r=0). Some people are calling it a glorified library card. If that was the case I *would* probably sign up. But looking at the collection of books **I don’t see many recent academic press publications, which is the largest proportion of my reading.** So as it it happens it *isn’t* a glorified library card. So I’m not signing up, even though the price point isn’t high at all.
