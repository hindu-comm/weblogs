But I’m violating my preference for reading books serially by simultaneously going through Matthew Stewart’s [Nature’s God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393064549/geneexpressio-20). It’s actually a hardcover book, as Stewart sent me a review copy. That makes it feel a little different when it comes to switching between [Nations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1107400023/geneexpressio-20/)and[Nature’s God](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393064549/geneexpressio-20).I’ve been a fan of Stewart’s books for a while, and [did a 10 questions with him in 2006](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-matthew-stewart.php). There’s a lot in this book that I knew from more conventional history about the founding (see Jay Winik’s [Great Upheaval](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SF9YJA/geneexpressio-20/)), but I’m enjoying the interleaving of ancient philosophy. Stewart does a great of intellectual detective work from what I can tell. If you don’t know much about philosophy, but are curious to peruse a non-academic survey, the author’s previous work [The Truth About Everything: An Irreverent History of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002VLZEHU/geneexpressio-20/) will be worth it.

Also, I’ve been a little disappointed by [Nations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1107400023/geneexpressio-20/). It’s good, but not nearly at the same level as [War and Human Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199236631/geneexpressio-20/). In that book the author had greater command of the material and clarity of presentation, so he didn’t try to keep hitting you over with the same point over and over. I’d still recommend the book, but readers should focus on the factual yield rather than the coherent thesis, since the basics of the latter are obvious early on.
