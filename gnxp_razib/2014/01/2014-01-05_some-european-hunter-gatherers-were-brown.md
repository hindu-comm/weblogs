Some European hunter-gatherers were brown

[![San_tribesman](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/San_tribesman.jpg?resize=200%2C299)![San_tribesman](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/San_tribesman.jpg?resize=200%2C299)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/San_tribesman.jpg)A phenotypic takeaway from the [ancient European DNA](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/12/23/001552) preprint has been that the hunter-gatherer from Luxembourg was light eyed and darker skinned (and dark haired), while the early farmer from Germany was lighter skinned and darker eyed (and dark haired). In yesterday’s [post](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/phenotypic-whiteness-as-an-outcome-of-neolithic-admixture/) a reader pointed out that I misinterpreted the genotypes of these two individuals at a very important pigmentation locus: I thought that it was homozygous for the lighter skin conferring allele which is at very high frequency in modern Europeans. **I was wrong.** A [SNP at this locus](http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;r=5:33951193-33952193;v=rs16891982;vdb=variation;vf=9666045), *SLC45A2*, correlated with darker complexion and eyes, is present at \~3% in Europeans (as opposed to \~100% in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa). In a European American sample the genotypes are as follows:

15, CC  
321, CG  
3964, GG

Both the hunter-gather and the farmer are CC. Combined with the hunter-gatherer being GG (which is nearly absent in modern Europeans) at *SLC24A5* it does seem that as the authors of the preprint were right, the hunter-gatherer had darker skin. The twist is that the region of the genome, *OCA2/HERC2*, that seems to explain most of the blue vs. non-blue eye color difference in Europe, is homozygous for the blue variant in the hunter-gatherer. I would say that if I had just the pigmentation loci I would think that the hunter-gatherer in this study was from a population mixed between Europeans and non-Europeans. For example, inhabitants of Cape Verde.

The hunter-gatherer individual sequenced from Loschbour rock shelter may be an anomaly. But you wouldn’t find this sort of individual among modern Europeans without recent non-European ancestry, even as an anomaly. So there’s something to explain.
