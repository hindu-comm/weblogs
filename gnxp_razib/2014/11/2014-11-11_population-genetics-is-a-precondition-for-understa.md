Population genetics is a precondition for understanding evolutionary process

[![principlespopulationgenetics](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/principlespopulationgenetics.png?resize=234%2C284)![principlespopulationgenetics](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/principlespopulationgenetics.png?resize=234%2C284)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)Since I’ve moved to [Unz Review](http://www.unz.com/) I’ve attracted a set of readers who are used to the level of discourse on topics evolutionary which is the norm on “HBD blogs.” **Let me be clear that I don’t tolerate uninformed speculation because I don’t care to listen to it as I don’t gain any value from it.** This is in response to a long and bizarre hectoring rant about my lack of credentials, the nature ofheredity, etc. It reminded me of the moron who accused me of not understanding [Lewontin’s Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genetic_Diversity:_Lewontin's_Fallacy) at Inducivist a few years ago (a further idiot also decided to “explain” epistasis to me). A buzz word or two does not sagacity make. Naturally this person was banned. But in any case this is as good a place as any to suggest that someone who wants to engage with me in a manner where I will take them seriously should be at least somewhat familiar with population genetics, and hopefully genomics. This naturally curtails communication with most of the human race, **and that’s the point.** I will at some point die in the future unless the Singularity arrives, so I do not wish to waste my time talking to most of the human race about things they know nothing of.

With the pleasantries out of the way I am here to offer a way to meet the threshold of knowledge which will make you fluent in leaving comments here.

– You can read [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20).

– Read the UConn [population genetics notes](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecturenotes/notes.html).

– Read Graham Coop’s [population genetics notes](http://gcbias.org/population-genetics-notes/).

– Read Joe Felsenstein’s [population genetics text](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/pgbook/pgbook.html).

All of these are pretty easy, and three of them are free. You don’t need to derive all the formalisms. God knows I haven’t. But you need a basic algebraic framework to think about the process quantitatively. Additionally, it is probably useful to get at least some genomics background since that’s the empirical data that is really relevant for much of the commentary on this weblog.

I hope I’m clear that any rude, annoying, and hectoring comments are going to result in immediate banning.
