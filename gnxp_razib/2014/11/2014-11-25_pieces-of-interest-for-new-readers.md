Pieces of interest for new readers….

Seeing as I might get an influx of people curious about me after reading my piece in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/opinion/our-cats-ourselves.html?), I thought it might be useful to put some links to posts which are representative of my *oeuvre*. In the wake of the paper [Comparative analysis of the domestic cat genome reveals genetic signatures underlying feline biology and domestication](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/05/1410083111.abstract), I wrote up something for this blog, [A Feline Genome in Full](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/a-feline-genome-in-full/)as well. It’s a bit more enriched on the “nerd quotient” than the piece in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/opinion/our-cats-ourselves.html?).

[![principlespopulationgenetics](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/principlespopulationgenetics.png?resize=234%2C284)![principlespopulationgenetics](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/principlespopulationgenetics.png?resize=234%2C284)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)I have been bloggingsince mid 2002, and my interests range widely, though there’s a consistent central focus on evolutionary genetics (here’s my [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed), and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan)). If you find some of the posts here abstruse, a read of [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) would clarify things a great deal. Here are a few genetics posts of interest:

[1 in 200 men direct descendants of Genghis Khan](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/1-in-200-men-direct-descendants-of-genghis-khan/#.VHQRcZ_09oA)

Here are some non-genetics pieces:

My newborn son was in the news this summer. We believe [he’s the first healthy human baby born with his whole genome already sequenced](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/527936/for-one-baby-life-begins-with-genome-revealed/).

Over the years, I’ve posed sets of ten questions to scholars and thinkers I value from various fields. Here are a few favorites:
