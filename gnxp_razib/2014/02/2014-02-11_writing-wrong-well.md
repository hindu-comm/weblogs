Writing wrong well

This [opinion by Norman Finkelstein](http://urbantimes.co/2014/01/norman-finkelstein-interview/) on writing really spoke to me:

He’s alluding to a general, not specific, problem. It isn’t just brilliant prose stylists who can pull a fast one. Engagement, and the ability to weave a good story, is one of the reasons why someone like [Malcolm Gladwell](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/10/11/gladwell-vs-chabris-david-vs-goliath/) is such a great success. But there’s a flip side: **truth need not come in an obscure and awkward package.** Great scientists such as Charles Darwin were also great communicators. The unfortunate reality though is that for far too many of the chattering class science as filtered through *The New Yorker* *is* science. The same with history, politics, and foreign affairs.
