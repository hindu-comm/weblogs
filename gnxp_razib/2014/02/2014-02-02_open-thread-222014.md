Didnâ€™t have time to talk about the [Neandertal admixture](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2014/01/resurrecting-neandertal-lineages-vernot.html) papers from last week. Big surprise to me is that no one segment from Neandertals seems*fixed*to 100%. Highest frequencies 60-70%. Implies we can do studies as to the phenotypic effects of the genic sequences, as there is variation within populations.
