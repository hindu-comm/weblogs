Notes

I was checking out [NuSapiens](https://nusapiens.blogspot.com/) and noticed that he’d been nominated for [Best New Weblog](http://weblogawards.org/2005/11/nominations_best_new_blog.php) on something called [The Weblog Awards](http://weblogawards.org/). First, congrats to Nu, he is certainly one of “Our Crowd.” Second, on a lark I decided to see if gnxp popped up, and I noticed that [Jeff of Beautiful Atrocities](http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/) nominated us for [Best Group Blog](http://weblogawards.org/2005/11/nominations_best_group_blog.php). Thanks Jeff! Seems a little weird that there isn’t a “Best Science Blog” category though (and I would vote for [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) FYI)….
