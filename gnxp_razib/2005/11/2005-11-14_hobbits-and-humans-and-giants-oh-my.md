Hobbits and humans and giants … oh my!

> A gigantic ape, measuring about 10 feet tall and weighing up to 1,200 > pounds, co-existed alongside humans, a geochronologist at McMaster > University has discovered. >
> Using a high-precision absolute-dating method (techniques involving > electron spin resonance and uranium series), Jack Rink, associate > professor of geography and earth sciences at McMaster, has determined > that Gigantopithecus blackii, **the largest primate that ever lived, > roamed southeast Asia for nearly a million years before the species > died out 100,000 years ago. This was known as the Pleistocene period, > by which time humans had already existed for a million years.** >
> “A missing piece of the puzzle has always focused on pin-pointing when > Gigantopithecus existed,” explains Rink. **“This is a primate that > co-existed with humans at a time when humans were undergoing a major > evolutionary change. Guangxi province in southern China, where the > Gigantopithecus fossils were found, is the same region where some > believe the modern human race originated.”**
