Format sidebar

I’ve now created a [format sidebar](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/format.php) option, which will be permanently available on the top of the sidebar itself. The feeds are now turned off by default because occasionally they are very slow, and if you use Internet Explorer the full page does not load until every last packet has trickled in. I suggest that you get [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) or [Flock](http://www.flock.com/developer/), as these browsers load the page sequentially, and I specifically placed the sidebar to the right so that you can view the content even if the bits of code don’t load properly (i.e., the blogrolling script). But, if you use Internet Explorer, as I said, the feeds will be turned off. Additionally, you can mask/hide other portions of the sidebar, and your preferences will be saved in a cookie the next time you visit. It’s all pretty self-explanatory, if you can’t figure it out, you shouldn’t be reading this weblog in the first place.

Update: Doesn’t seem like the feature works on Flock. It does work on Firefox and Explorer. You are dead to me if you use other browsers (this is just so I don’t get emails and complaints from every Safari, Opera and Konqueror user out there).

**Update II:** Use cautiously in Safari. Looks like I can make things disappear, but not reappear (i.e., the cookie settings seem to persist within session).
