"Diversity" @ Harvard, a reminder….

I was checking to see which “similar pages” google popped up for this weblog, and found this article from Harvard Magazine, [“Roots” and Race](http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/090443.html). We’ve tacked this [issue](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002642.html) [before](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002566.html), but I though I’d pass on the interesting statistics dug up on this topic.

n = 170

Ethnic self-identification of Harvard black students

Black American, 57.1%  
Afro-Caribbean, 21.2%  
African, 13.6%  
Bi-ethnic or biracial, 25.9%

Generational status, Black Harvard vs. US aggregates

1st generation, 8%, 6.1%  
2nd generation, 41%, 3.3%  
3rd generation, 6%, 0.9%  
4th+ generation, 45%, 89.7%

Now, I don’t much think about these topics anymore, science is much cleaner & exciting. Nevertheless, it is important to remind myself of why I’m a cynic sometimes. You can read the [original paper](http://www.princeton.edu/%7Ejpia/pdf2002/Vol13_Spring02_3.pdf) too (note that 50% of the fathers of black Harvard freshmen have advanced degrees, diversity by race, but not SES).
