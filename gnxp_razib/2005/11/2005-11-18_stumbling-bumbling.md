Stumbling & bumbling

I have noticed over the past few days that a lot of people are coming through [Stumble Upon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/). I’ve used this in the past, and it is a neat service. And at this point, it is now the \#1 source of new traffic to the site besides google and yahoo! I don’t know if this will last, though the google boost in the fall of 2003 did stick. If you did come via [Stumble Upon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/), welcome.
