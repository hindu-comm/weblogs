An "honest" question

My correspondent follows up:

As I said, there are many hypotheses that are irrefutable. I think the design one is (so is the idea we are simulations in a computer of incredible power). Anyone who has even mildly looked into the topic knows that this is a serious problem.

There goes 5 minutes of my life.
