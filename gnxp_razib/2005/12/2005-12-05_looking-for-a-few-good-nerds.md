Looking for a Few Good Nerds

For the last few years I have been working on a new architecture for the Internet, which you can read about [here](http://domicel.domicel.net/doc/Read%20About%20Domicel.html):

> *Problem:* >
> How can we deliver applications as services, over the Internet, and > get PC-like functionality, where each user can **mix-and-match > applications as if they are on a PC**? >
> (Note: The question does **not** refer to pure user-interface issues > that are addressed by [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX)!) >
> *Solution:* >
> *Domicel is a **virtual** personal Internet domain. It gives the end > user the look-and-feel of working on a PC – without the PC! > Applications are provided as on-line services, in an object-oriented > paradigm. The aggregate of a user’s objects (think: icons) from all > applications, hosted anywhere in the world, is their > [Domicel](http://domicel.domicel.net/) – there is no one place in > which a Domicel’s objects reside, no bottlenecks, and no central point > of failure.*

Or, to put it another way, it does for applications what the World Wide Web does for documents.

It’s still very primitive – I think of it as being the Internet version of the [Altair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800), “the spark that led to the personal computer revolution”. At this point, I would like to get a few good nerds interested. If I can get it going, I think it will be very big.

You can see the current state of the art [here](http://domicel.domicel.net/login.html). Notice the links in the upper right-hand corner.

PS: There is the beginning of a discussion on Domicel [here](http://www.rishon-rishon.com/archives/2005_12.php#140791).
