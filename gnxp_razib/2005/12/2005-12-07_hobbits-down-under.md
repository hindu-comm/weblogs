Hobbits Down Under

According to *the Australian*, Mike Morwood, leader of the Homo floresiensis discovery team, has now [raised the idea](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,17497640%255E2702,00.html) that they originally lived in Australia and were pushed out by the colonizing human aborigines.

The article doesn’t go into the details of Morwood’s hunch, but we’ll see if it goes further than the [Hobbit-as-Monkey](http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/10/27/hobbit_as_monkey.php) theory.
