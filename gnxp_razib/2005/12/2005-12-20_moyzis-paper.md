Moyzis paper

There’s an interesting article (by Eric Wang, Bob Moyzis and company, using HapMap data) coming out in the next day or so in PNAS. It’s covered by Science: <http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/1220/2>

Seems that they’ve found some 1800 human genes currently undergoing selective sweeps: most are regional. The gene functions ae highly concentrated in host-pathogen interactions, reproduction, DNA metabolism/cell cycle, protein metabolism, and neuronal function.

Update from Razib: Here is the [link to the abstract](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0509691102v1), it is “open access” so you can read the full PDF.

Update from Razib II: More from [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/selection/wang_2006_recent_selection.html) &
[Steve](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2005/12/human-evolution-and-genetic.html). Also, check out [Civilization has left its mark on genes](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8483&print=true).

Update from Razib III: [Related item](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2005/12/positive-selection-in-nat2-gene.html) from Dienekes on a specific locus that suggests selection on early farmers….

Update from Razib IV: Agnostic has an [interesting article](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/2005/12/group-differences-pathogens.html).
