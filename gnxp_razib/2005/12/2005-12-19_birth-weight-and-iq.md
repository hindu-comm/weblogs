Birth weight and IQ

Aftenposten, one of the leading newspapers in Norway, ran a [story](http://www.aftenposten.no/helse/article1181053.ece) on Saturday about a study on birth weight and IQ conducted by [Martha Gunn Eide](http://www.uib.no/info/dr_grad/2005/EideMartha.htm), a researcher at the University of Bergen. (Eide is a medical doctor and this research represents her work toward a Doctorate of Medicine degree. Her thesis is entitled “Associations of Perinatal Conditions with Adult Body Size and Intelligence: A Register-based Cohort Study in Norway 1967-1999.”)

Below the fold are some highlights from the article (apologies for the rough quality of my translation!) \>\>

> **“Store babyer faar hoeyest IQ”** \[**“Big babies get highest IQ”**\] >
> The birth weight of a newborn baby boy has significance for > intelligence, course \[success\] and income…. >
> \[Martha Gunn\] Eide defends in a few days her Dr. Med. degree at the > University of Bergen. She has completed a very comprehensive study > based on the combined data of nearly 400,000 male children. >
> “Are there grounds to believe there is a correlation between birth > weight and IQ also in girls?” >
> “There is no call to believe that this would be appreciably different > for girls,” says Eide, who is affiliated with The Department of Public > Health and Primary Health Care, Faculty of Medicine at the University > of Bergen. >
> Her study is based on information from the Medical Birth Register, > Vernepliktsverket \[compulsory military service department\], the > Statistics Central Bureau and the Rikstrygdeverket \[Social Insurance > department\]. With this Eide has followed ca. 317,000 baby boys that > were born in Norway between 1967-1979 through 18 years, as they met > the \[military\] recruitment in period 1984-1999. >
> “The data are comprehensive facts analyzed for all boys in Norway over > a 13 year period,” says the Bergen researcher, who has worked four > years on the project. >
> 5200 gram

> “What we find is that birth weight is important for IQ. Higher birth > weight, higher IQ,” says [Kjell G. > Salvanes](http://www.nhh.no/sam/cv/salvanes-kjell.html) \[1\], > professor in Social Economics at the Norwegian School of Economics and > Business Administration in Bergen…. >
> Professor Salvanes has, together with two other international > researchers, Sandra E. Black in Los Angeles and Paul J. Devereux in > Dublin, investigated which factors are responsible for who takes > higher degrees and get jobs with the highest pay….

godless discussed birth weight and IQ [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002613.html) while musing on C-sections as artificial selection.
