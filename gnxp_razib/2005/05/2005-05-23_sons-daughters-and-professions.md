Sons, daughters and professions

Not much time, but I wanted to [link to this blog entry](http://www.illuminatingscience.org/?p=222) which reviews the [recent paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_aset=V-WA-A-W-D-MsSAYWA-UUW-U-AAAEVYAVZW-AAADUZWWZW-AWEABVUEW-D-U&_rdoc=1&_fmt=full&_udi=B6WMD-4F3FSD9-1&_coverDate=04%2F21%2F2005&_cdi=6932&_orig=search&_st=13&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000056308&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2148430&md5=7d468f0c451b7f6c5fbcc214bf14738d#tbl2) by Kanazawa and Vandermassen which surveys 3,000 individuals and finds a strong tendency for people in “systemizing” professions to have sons and vice-versa for those in “empathizing” professions. If you want a “pulse of the public” (or high schoolers posing as programmers) check out this [thread](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/23/1152246&tid=14) at Slashdot.

Addendum: I have heard from animal science people that a variety of alterations in the equilibrium of chemicals in semen can shift the XX:XY balance greatly.
