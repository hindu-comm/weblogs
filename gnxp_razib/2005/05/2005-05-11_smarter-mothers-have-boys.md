Smarter Mothers Have Boys?

[Mothers pregnant with boys may be less forgetful than those carrying girls](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N1092737.htm), Canadian researchers said on Tuesday.

The researchers said they found evidence that women who gave birth to boys consistently outperformed moms of girls in tests that specifically taxed memory in areas of listening, computational and visualization skills.

Interesting. But more importantly, this is the perfect excuse for pregnancy anecdotes. Tell your stories.
