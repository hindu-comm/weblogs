Time to put Creationism in the schools

All right, it’s time for local school boards to start mandating the teaching of all that Intelligent Design garbage alongside Evolution.

Enough people believe it — enough people in important positions no less — that ignorance of the main tenants of ID is akin to ignorance of the Bible.

And the place where ID should be taught is biology class. Sure, it could be shunted off into comparative religion courses, but its subject matter is more technical than religious. Besides, it is biology teachers who have the expertise to deal with the subject, so they should be the ones teaching it.

And don’t worry, [it’s not like the kids are getting anything out of grade/middle/high school science courses anyway.](http://www.learner.org/teacherslab/pup/) (Link courtesy of Greg Cochran. I recommend his “What Education Crisis?” article from the May [American Conservative](http://www.amconmag.com/).)

Addendum

On the subject of Creationism, I do have one recent story to tell. I had a conversation with my boss the other day about Darwin on Trial. My boss had just read it. He believed in Evolution he said, but he thought that Johnson had made a lot of good points.

Now a few years ago, Johnson came to my college to give a talk. I was there in order to write an editorial about the event afterwards. (A discussion over the editorial got me called “crazy or a liar” by Johanthan Wells, so I’m happy I wrote it. Wouldn’t do it now though.)

Knowing Johnson’s style, I suggested to my boss that we look at a couple of the claims he makes in detail. With a little help from the [Talk Origins Transitional Vertebrae FAQ](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html), my boss was significantly less impressed by Johnson after just a few minutes.
