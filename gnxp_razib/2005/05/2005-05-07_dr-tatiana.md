Dr Tatiana

I watched Dr Tatiana’s Sex Advice To All Creation this week on British TV (Channel 4). It was a co-production with Discovery Channel Canada , and I think it is scheduled to appear in Canada soon. It isn’t clear if it will be shown in the US – the sexual contents and language may be too strong for middle-America.

I quite enjoyed the series – even the musical intervals – but I doubt that I would have learned anything from it if I knew nothing about the subject to begin with. I guess it will increase sales for Olivia Judson’s book, which may have been the main object of the exercise from her point of view.

Apart from the wildly gimmicky presentation, I found Olivia Judson’s voice distracting. She has the poshest voice I’ve heard on British TV since Hugh Laurie played Bertie Wooster. She’s so posh she makes the Duchess of Devonshire sound common. Her voice sounded a bit strained, and I wondered if she is really hiding the dark secret that she is – American! Well, her father is American, her brother is at MIT, and she took her first degree at Stanford, so I think she must have spent a lot of time in America – was she even born there? Maybe she is overcompensating for it with an exaggerated English accent. Just a suggestion…
