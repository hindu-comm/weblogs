Class in the USA

The NYT has a series of articles this week on Class in America.

I haven’t had time to read much yet but thought I’d mention it. [Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/class/OVERVIEW-FINAL.html?pagewanted=1) is the first overview article. (Free registration may be required.)
