Happy mom's day

From the [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/opinion/08ellison.html?oref=login) (via free subscription):  
And there are other ways that being a dedicated parent strengthens our minds. Research shows that learning and memory skills can be improved by bearing and nurturing offspring. A team of [neuroscientists in Virginia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10647003&dopt=Citation) found that mother lab rats, just like working mothers, demonstrably excel at time-management and efficiency, racing around mazes to find rewards and get back to the pups in record time. Other research is showing how [hormones](https://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ProduktNr=223842&Ausgabe=225027&ArtikelNr=21726) elevated in [parenting](http://sun2.science.wayne.edu/~nal/moffat_maternal.pdf) can help buffer mothers from anxiety and stress – a timely gift from a sometimes compassionate Mother Nature.

Of course, they put in the mandatory swipe at IQ/intelligence, assuming there is this orthogonal entity called [emotional](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~pjm21/psychometrics/robertsetal2001.pdf) [intelligence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V9F-4BHJV09-2&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2004&_alid=275027668&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=5897&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000049994&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=3419478&md5=759cb5526991ab3152d25541f0564698) that can add oodles above-and-beyond g in predicting job/educational/life outcomes, but skip over that part and you get to the crux of the article’s idea: Perhaps then we can start to re-imagine a mother’s brain as less a handicap than a keen asset in the lifelong task of getting smart, i.e., the non-recursive mother-child relation. Mothers influence their children’s intellectual development (well, prenatally and in the first 5 or so years, anyway), but the kid’s repay the favor by influencing her own cognitive development.

In other words, we’re getting back to [Bell and Harper’s](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/080326058X/geneexpressio-20/) 20+ year old work. Happy mom’s day, indeed.
