"Anthropology"

[Anthropology](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=anthropology): 1. The scientific study of the origin, the behavior, and the physical, social, and cultural development of humans.

Now, believe it or not, [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/) and [these guys/girls](http://savageminds.org/) (an anthro group blog) are in the same discipline. Kind of weird. [Savage Minds](http://savageminds.org/) doesn’t seem to have a physical/biological anthropologist on their roster. Then again, [Crooked Timber](http://www.crookedtimber.org/) doesn’t seem to have a natural scientist on their long list of contributors. What was that about A Different Voice?
