Natural history of Ashkenazi I.Q.

Seeing as how the [Overclocking](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004045.html) thread has generated good comments and hasn’t degenerated, [I’ll link to the discussion thread here](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/4045/), so it stays on the front page….

Update: A [critique](http://metzenberg.judaismo.org/cochran_harpending/) of the paper. I don’t have time to read it, though a quick skim indicates to me that Greg would have some very big bones to pick with the historical contentions.

Update from J.M: Picked up by [Haaretz](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/584626.html) (just an unoriginal blurb). A better [article](http://jta.org/page_print_story.asp?intarticleid=15509&intcategoryid=5) at JTA (thanks Diana). Also 600 comments at [Slashdot](http://science.slashdot.org/science/05/06/08/0110241.shtml?tid=191&tid=14) if that’s your cup of tea.

Update: [Long piece](https://www.forward.com/main/article.php?ref=200506081150) in The Forward.

Update: [Jim Hu’s response](http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=3&pid=1857). The “Update” kind of made me laugh. Jim [follows up](http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=3&pid=1874) again. One thing…it seems clear that the perception that there was founder effect is probably the biggest technical hurdle to acceptance. Neil Risch is a big ass mofo (rep wise).

Important update: I’ve put the links to the posts and comments related to this topic at the top right. Until the buzz dies down they’ll be there.
