other psychometrics

It occurs to me that many of the people interested in IQ would find it worth their time to investigate other psychometrics. [Here](http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/bsmb2.doc) (doc) and [here](http://www.childrenofmillennium.org/eugenics/pages/psych2.htm) would be a few places to start.

I would like to know how well major intellectual accomplishments can be predicted from the combined knowledge of IQ and big 5 personality metrics. I would guess that a good scientist needs high openness, conscientiousness, and low agreeableness almost as much as high IQ, but I could easily be wrong. The would would benefit immensely from a statistical technique that could seperate the Gell-Mans from the Maralyns, or from one which could give us a Harvard class capable of elementary formal reasoning such as is required to complete a Wason Selection task.
