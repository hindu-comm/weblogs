Types, categories and discussion….

Language can be a bitch. I’m not one who believes that “thought is created by language,” there is probably something like mentalese since people can actually ask the question whether language totally bounds thought. But language is a clunker sometimes, and the tendency to talk in terms of a few types, thrown across the cognitive plain in a slapdash manner, whether you mean to or not, is really frustrating.

I posted comments (or tried to\*) at the cultural anthropology weblog [Savage Minds](http://savageminds.org/), and Kerim excised this portion of my post relating to [“ethno-autism”](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001967.html):

Hindus, it is true, do not proslyetize aggressively or practice much intolerance, but then, but of course, caste acts as an integrative and segregative phenomenon that makes conversion or unified outlook unecessary. Tolerance and religious pluralism is gained at a rather repulsive cost (from the Western perspective).

I bold the part “Hindus” because what exactly does it mean to be a Hindu? Are Hindus as I have characterized them? One response, which is fair enough, is that Hindus have been known to engage in religious intolerance. And no, I’m not talking about the recent communal tensions between the Hindutva nationalists and Islamists as two antipodes, I’m talking about battles between Jain and Hindu kings in southern India in the early medieval period which resembled sectarian conflict like that between Protestants and Catholics in Reformation Europe or [Asharites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asharite) and [Mutazilites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutazilite) during the Abbasid Caliphate.

If one thinks of “Hindus” as a Platonic bounded ideal than any characterization of Hindus is basically impossible. Unlike the Abrahamic monotheisms belief in God is not necessary in Hinduism, not only is Hindu identity partially ethnic, there are atheistic schools of Hinduism. Additionally, some Hindus claim even atheistic and materialistic (rejecting spirit and karma) sects like the [Carvaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvaka) as part of the “broach church” of their tradition, not to mention the contention that everyone is a Hindu because they are part of the monistic reality of the Brahma.

We must move past purely deductive and Platonic absolutes and settle for working definitions. “Hindus” are a finite subset of humanity who espouse an overlaping set of doctrines, practice, customs, traditions and self-identify as “Hindus” as opposed to non-Hindus (note that for much of history Hindu was less a religious identity than simply the term for an inhabitant of the Indian subcontinent and a member of the wider cultural complex that defined that region). Despite the instances of religious intolerance that characterize Hindu culture as a whole, overall there is a qualitative difference in the modal behavorial attitude toward other religions when compared to the traditions of Christianity and Islam. This can be illustrated by the attitude of Hindus toward Jews and Zoroastrians, both groups which fled western Eurasia because of religious or social persecution. In India both groups have integrated into the social structure and preserved something of their distinctive folkways in the midst of far more numerous peoples. In contrast, both Muslim and Christian societies have had a tendency toward periodic persecutions, which are often accompanied by wholesale absorption of minority religious traditions (these persecutions need not be frequent, simply frequent enough over the long term to result in a persistent shift toward the majority cultural complex).

But I’m going to get the point now. All this is important because Platonic thinking really throws a wrench into discussing public policy in terms of cultural and civilizational relations with any sort of precision. I have of late expressed some skepticism toward the putative Islamicization of Europe because the numbers seem upon closer inspection far less impressive than the often disturbing anecdotal tales bandied about in the press. The key here is numbers, the magnitude of the vector matters. In the same light casual analogies to Spain and Greece when discussing possible absorption of Turkey into the European Union are frustrating, because even assuming that Spain and Greece are analogous culturally,1 there seems a cavalier neglect of the magnitude of numerical difference. Turkey would come into the European Union as an enormous nation-state. When you make recourse to Platonic thinking these sort of obvious realities can be glossed over, “Turkey” is a type, and if you can present the Kemalist elite as the idealized “Turkey” than your argument is won, while opponents of Turkish entry will argue that if you scratch the Turk undernearth you have the Ottoman (or Saracen?). Buth are correct in that the Kemalist and Ottoman-Islamic strains are both components of the vector that is “Turkey.”

In any case, I have I think shown my cards as to how I feel about Turkish integration into the E.U., but, keeping in mind the internal variation of what it means to be Turkish (the populational distribution) and the relative numbers of “Turks” and “Europeans,” I think people can have a fruitful discussion about the sociological dynamics. As it is, too many debates around this issue seem purely rooted in norms, values and projections of the intentions of the “opposition,” with a sideshow of trying to characterize Turks or Europeans as Platonic ideals of some sort that are, or aren’t, compatible.

1 – I would argue that there is a difference between an analogy between Roman Catholic emigration to the United States circa 1900 and non-white/non-Christian emigration to the United States circa 2000 vs. integration of Spain and Greece in the past generation and Turkey today into the E.U. The key here is time. In 1900 the subjective perceived distance of the Protestant WASP majority in the United States and “Popish” masses was rather large compared to today in the post-Protestant-Catholic-Jew consensus. Though I am do not necessarily totally accept the analogy between Roman Catholics and Muslims in relation to the Protestant/Christian majority of the United States, when you add time into the picture and the shift toward ecumenicalism on the part of the majority culture, the subjective distance between the majority culture and Muslims might be analogous to that between Protestant natives and Roman Catholics from Ireland, southern and eastern Europe in 1900. The European case though is different because the time scales are compressed a great deal. The absorption of Greece and Spain are rather recent, within cultural memory, so the shift toward Turkey as the “next” circle of integration is not to me as persuasive.
