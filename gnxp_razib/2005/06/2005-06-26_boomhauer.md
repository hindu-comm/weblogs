"Boomhauer!"

Great [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/magazine/26WWLN.html?pagewanted=all) about King of the Hill in The New York Times Magazine, the only point where I would demur is that the “Hank Hills” of the world could ever be part of a Democratic coalition again. The red-meat-eating, Wal-Mart shopping and gun-owning lifestyle induces such a visceral reaction (and vice versa) among a certain segment of the core Democratic electorate that I don’t know if an alliance could get beyond the emotional aversion.
