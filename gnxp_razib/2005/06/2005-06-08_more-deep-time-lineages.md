More deep time lineages….

[  
Deep haplotype divergence and long-range linkage disequilibrium at Xp21.1 provide evidence that humans descend from a structured ancestral population](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15937130&query_hl=6). Please note that the authors moot the possibility of natural selection maintaining this allele, though they seem to favor introgression from a population with a separate lineal history followed by interbreeding/absorption into the “modern”1 population. I recommend [John Hawk’s critique](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/genetics_mre_aapa_2005.html) of the logic of some of these studies.

1 – If “fitness is a bugger” I am beginning to really consider that “species is a bugger” too.
