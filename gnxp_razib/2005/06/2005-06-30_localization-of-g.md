localization of g

The extreme localization of g strongly confirms that psychometric tests are measuring something real, but also strongly suggests that g is only an aspect of intelligence. After all, the rest of the brain is also doing information processing of a variety of types. This information processing is vital to goal accomplishment. Ultimately, this should not be new news. There are plenty of examples of people being severely cognitively impaired by brain damage without loosing IQ. Lobotomy patients are one of the more historically important examples of this. At any rate, how do those here interpret this. Is there simply not enough normal variability between people in how their non-g associated information processing works for it to have practical significance?
