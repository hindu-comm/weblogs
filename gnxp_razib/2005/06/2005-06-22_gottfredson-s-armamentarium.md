Gottfredson's Armamentarium

For any who are interested in Intelligence/g research, I highly recommend looking at [Dr. Linda Gottfredson’s](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/index.html) web site. She has (almost) her entire collected works freely available to the public, even the to-be-published stuff. Of particular note are the following (recent) manuscripts:

1\. Gottfredson, L. S. (in press). [Implications of cognitive differences for schooling within diverse societies.](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004cognitivedifferences&schooling.pdf) In C. L. Frisby & C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Comprehensive Handbook of Multicultural School Psychology. New York: Wiley.

\[Nice, up-to-date review of group differences, with educational implications\]

2\. Gottfredson, L. S. (2004). [Realities in desegregating gifted education.](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004desegregatingGiftedEducation.pdf) In D. Booth & J. C. Stanley (Eds.), In the eyes of the beholder: Critical issues for diversity in gifted education (pp. 139-155). Waco, TX: Prufrock Press

\[She compares the Discrimination vs. the Distribution hypotheses; a very nice synthesis of the g-Big 5 \[give or take a factor\] core of much of differential psychology\]

3\. Gottfredson, L. S. (2003). [Dissecting practical intelligence theory: Its claims and evidence.](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2003dissecting.pdf) Intelligence, 31, 343-397.

\[Gottfredson pretty much shred’s [Sternberg’s](http://www.yale.edu/pace/teammembers/personalpages/bob.html) Triarchic/Practical Intelligence theory\]

–See also: Gottfredson, L. S. (2003). [Practical intelligence](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2003PIentry.pdf). Pages 740-745 in R. Fernandez-Ballesteros (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychological assessment. London: Sage.

And my two particular favorites (because of my line of work):

Gottfredson, L. S. (2000). [Equal potential: A Collective fraud](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2000equalpotential.pdf). Society, 37, 19-28.

Gottfredson, L. S. (2005). [Suppressing intelligence research: Hurting those we intend to help.](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2005suppressingintelligence.pdf) In R. H. Wright & N. A. Cummings (Eds.), Destructive trends in mental health: The well-intentioned path to harm (pp. 155-186). New York: Taylor and Francis.

There are, of course, many others, and it is well worth an hour or two of your time to read a handful of the stuff there. If you read the whole site, I recommend going to your academic adviser and asking for some Independent Study credit hours, as you’ll hardly find a better on-line compendium of literature in this particular field.
