Thailand Gets Serious About IQ

After yesterdayâ€™s interview with Lee Kuan Hew comes another example of Asiaâ€™s determination to enter the developed world. Bangkokâ€™s *The Nation* reports on Thailandâ€™s effort to get to the bottom of its low IQ ([*Govt to Map Countryâ€™s Intelligence*](http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/13/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_18334355.html)):

> â€œA project using demographic maps to identify areas of > iodine-deficiency and low intelligence are being drawn on the belief > there is a connection between the two. In all, the Department of > Health and the Department of Mental Health will draw three maps in an > effort to combat low intelligence, after it a study found the average > IQ level among many youths was lower than 80. >
> Two of the maps will focus on iodine deficiency: one depicting the > average level of iodine in pregnant women and another showing the > percentage of people who have access to iodised salt in each area. >
> A third map will focus on the average IQ level among children in every > province.â€?

This of course is in line with the Copenhagen Consensus which [suggested](http://www.vdare.com/sailer/copenhagen.htm) that more action into raising cognitive abilities by combating malnutrition (an idea associated with Richard Lynn) was one of the best ways to improve the lot of developing countries. *The Nation* reported on the data that pushed this initiative a few years ago ([*IQ Survey ‘Cause for Alarm’*](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&id=55108&usrsess=)):

> â€? . . . a National Health Examination Survey team released a report > just before Children’s Day last month that **the average IQ of Thai > school children, based on tests in 1997 on 3,846 schoolchildren > between six and 12 years old was a poor 91.96** . . . “When other > countries monitor the IQ scores of their children, they want them to > reach their full potential.

It’s good to see a modernizing country take intelligence seriously, and hopefully their efforts will pay off and set a model for other developing nations. The data also lend further support to the reliability of international IQ scores. For instance, the recent study discussed above was not included in *IQ & the Wealth of Nations*, because it was released in the same year as the book (2002), but Lynn and Vanhanen did find and include an earlier report from Thailand. The data from a 1989 sample of 8 to 10 year olds on the Colored Progressive Matrices indicated an IQ of 91, which is the same as the 1997 score even with a decade between the two measurements. This is tyical as the reliability correlation reported in *IQ&tWoN* for nations where data from more than one IQ study was available was .94.
