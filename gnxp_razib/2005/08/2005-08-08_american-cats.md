American cats

[DNA traces evolution of extinct sabertooths and the American cheetah-like cat](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-08/cp-dte080305.php). Basically, the famous saber-toothed cat ([Smilodon](http://www.bbc.co.uk/beasts/evidence/prog5/page2.shtml)) has a distant relationship to the rest of the felines, while the “American cheetah” is actually a case of convergent evolution to the Old World cheetah, as it seems to have been derived from an ancient proto-puma.
