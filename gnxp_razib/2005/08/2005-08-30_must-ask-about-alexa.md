Must ask about Alexa….

OK, first, check out the [similar pages](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&q=related:www.gnxp.com/) to GNXP over at [Google](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&safe=off&q=related:www.gnxp.com/). There are no great surprises, really popular blogs like [Marginal Revolution](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/) show up, blogs we have a long-standing relationshp with, like [Steve Sailer](http://www.isteve.com/) are also on the list, and topically related ones like [Carl Zimmer](http://www.corante.com/loom/) make the cut. What I want to ask though is that for years our [Alexa profile](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&url=www.gnxp.com) has shown that [Dr. Weevil](http://www.doctorweevil.org/) and the [Greatest Jeneration](http://www.greatestjeneration.com/) as among the top 10 related links. Why??? I don’t think we’ve ever linked to those blogs (if it wasn’t for Alexa I would never have known about them), and I don’t think they link to us. I don’t even think that I have seen them linked to from the weblogs I do read (not many, but almost all of them are on the “similar links” page of Alexa and Google). I don’t really know what they’re about. So why is Alexa telling everyone that those blogs are similar to GNXP? This is been the case for the past 2 years (the time I’ve checked Alexa regularly). Are there very regular readers of those two blogs who have the Alexa toolbar and also read this blog?

Sorry, I had to get this out there, I’ve been wondering for a long time (some of the other “site info” for the blogs look really strange to me, look at what [Instapundit readers are supposed to be checking out](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&url=www.instapundit.com/)).
