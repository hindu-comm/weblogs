502 errors

If you are getting 502 errors please switch browsers or use [anonymouse](http://anonymouse.org/anonwww.html). I have been informed that this is a problem in particular with the AOL browser…which doesn’t surprise me since they are known to “optimize” (last I recall) the browsing experience by caching files and re-compressing images.
