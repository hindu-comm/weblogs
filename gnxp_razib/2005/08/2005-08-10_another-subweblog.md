Another subweblog

I’ve decided to start another weblog related to [Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/) which is more focused on political or social observations, named [Politics Gene Expression](http://politics.gnxp.com/). The posts there will be more derivative and less substantive (no science). I think I’ve given everyone who wants it privs over that blog, but email me if I haven’t. You can always find the link under “tributary weblogs.”
