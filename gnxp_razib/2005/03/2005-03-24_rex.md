Rex

[T. Rex Soft Tissue Found Preserved](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/03/0324_050324_trexsofttissue.html). The only caution I would offer is that I recall claims that T-Rex DNA was extracted back in 1994…though the consensus now seems to be that that was contamination.

GFA adds: [Here](http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/YEC_and_dino_blood.htm) is Gary Hurd’s review of the last time rex molecules made headlines.

On a related note, the journal Acta Zoologica Sinca has a new issue devoted to dinosaurish things, including an astoundingly [bad critique](http://www.actazool.org/downloadpdf.asp?id=1434) of the theropod hypothesis of bird origins by pseudoscientist Larry Martin. The entire issue can be seen [here](http://www.actazool.org/issuedetail.asp?volume=50&number=6&issue_id=93).
