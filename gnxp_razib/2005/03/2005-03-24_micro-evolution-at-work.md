(Micro)evolution at work….

[Widespread Parallel Evolution in Sticklebacks by Repeated Fixation of Ectodysplasin Alleles](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/307/5717/1928) (free registration):

Major phenotypic changes evolve in parallel in nature by molecular mechanisms that are largely unknown. Here, we use positional cloning methods to identify the major chromosome locus controlling armor plate patterning in wild threespine sticklebacks. Mapping, sequencing, and transgenic studies show that the Ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway plays a key role in evolutionary change in natural populations and that parallel evolution of stickleback low-plated phenotypes at most freshwater locations around the world has occurred by repeated selection of Eda alleles derived from an ancestral low-plated haplotype that first appeared more than two million years ago. Members of this clade of low-plated alleles are present at low frequencies in marine fish, which suggests that standing genetic variation can provide a molecular basis for rapid, parallel evolution of dramatic phenotypic change in nature.

I stumbled on this research via a [popular article](http://newswire.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.pl?ascribeid=20050324.081508&time=11%2000%20PST&year=2005&public=0) which to me smells of neo-saltationist rhetoric. Interesting, certainly it seems a structural constraint of human cognitive architecture that variations in frequencies across populations are repackaged as essential typological jumps or jerks. If paleontologists examined fossils of sticklebacks they might conclude that they were two separate species with a common ancestor. In the open ocean whatever “costs” accrued by the generation of armor-plating are more than compensated for by the survival benefits that are conferred. It seems (on first glance) that the “low-plated” phenotype emerges as the dominant morph because of the release of functional constraint on that locus.
