Cry baby….

Carl [posts](http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/03/07/darwin_in_the_crib.php) about differences between the babies of foragers and farmers/moderns. These sort of shifts of infant behavior dependent on the input that parents (and the ability of the babies to manipulate said parents) provide contingent upon social-environmental constraints make me cautious about assuming an overpowering EEA across a host of variables. Additionally, babies also likely differ in intrinsic temperament, as do the sexes, and according to Jerome Kagan [infants of different populations also exhibit variant modal personalities](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000519.html). All this suggests a dynamism on a variety of levels, from the proximate behavorial context all the way to the microevolutionary scale, which is underemphasized by fixating on monomorphic universal traits.
