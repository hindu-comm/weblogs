For the ladies-part II

Seeing as how there is a controversy of non-linking in the blogosphere (generally in the context of sites with 1-2 orders of magnitude greater number of visitors than GNXP) to the Y-less kind, I have chosen to do my part. Since I don’t read blogs much I can’t really tell you about any diamondesses-in-the-rough, so what I did was:

1\) Move [Jinderella](https://hot_needle_of_inquiry.blogspot.com) to the top of “our other blogs.”  
2) Moved all females to the top of “friends and visitors.”  
3) Moved [Robin Roberts](https://robinroberts.blogspot.com/) up too, his name sounds kind of girly, like the [female sports journalist](http://www.nwhp.org/tlp/biographies/roberts/roberts-bio.html).  
4) Moved [Bill Allison](http://www.ideofact.com) up, since his last name is “Allison.”

Past experience suggests that those near the top of the lists get the most traffic form this blog.
