UK Social Trends

The UK’s Office for National Statistics has just published the annual survey of Social Trends in the UK. This provides (relatively) easily digested statistics and analysis on all aspects of the UK’s population and social life. The ONS website provides full access to the book [here](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/socialtrends35/), either in bite-sized chunks or as the complete text. The latter is over 5Mb of pdf, so it takes a while to download (and a lot of disk space), but as the printed book costs £45, a free download is quite a bargain!

I would be interested to know whether the US (and other countries) have anything comparable.
