And Speaking of Penises…

Wassersug et al. (2004) have a (interesting? painful?) survey of 134 men with an interest in castration. Here are some numbers:

Age

Under 25: 4%  
25–35: 16%  
35–45: 23%  
45–55: 38%  
Over 55: 17%  
No answer provided: 2%

Education

Non-HS: 1%  
HS graduate: 16%  
2 yrs college: 22%  
4 yrs college: 25%  
Postcollege: 25%  
Doctoral degree: 9%  
No answer provided: 3%

Reasons respondents desire castration (by number of responses)

A feeling of calm, often called the eunuch calm: 42  
A sense of control over one’s sexual urges and/or sexual appetite: 41  
The excitement of the castration scene itself: 32  
Cosmetic effect. Just like the look: 31  
Feeling a deep desire to be submissive to partner: 26

Interesting that they have a much higher rate of advanced education than the general population.
