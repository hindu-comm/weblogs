Statistics Primer

So many of our posts are reliant on statistical understanding, which we don’t write about too often, but Kim Swygert comes to the rescue with her series on the fundamentals of statistics. She starts off with a discussion on [percentile](http://www.kimberlyswygert.com/archives/002738.html), proceeds to [Measures of Central Tendency,](http://www.kimberlyswygert.com/archives/002740.html) [Measures of Variability,](http://www.kimberlyswygert.com/archives/002748.html) and today’s topic is [Scales of Measurement.](http://www.kimberlyswygert.com/archives/002750.html)

If you ever had any questions you wanted to ask a pyschometrician, well here’s your chance.
