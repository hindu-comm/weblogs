Ladies' Choice Poll Results

I thought this comment from razib is apropos to my poll, since I hypothesize that mate selection on IQ is an important factor for the XX.  
in the mating mind one way geoff miller pumps up sexual selection and polygyny is that it is a way to reduce genetic load and avoid mutational meltdown. miller also asserts that since around 1/3 of genes might have some impact on the brain (iâ€™ve seen this quoted elsewhere, donâ€™t know where it comes from), cognitive display is a good way to evaluate genetic health.  
Here are the results:

Steven Pinkerâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦14%â€¦â€¦â€¦.9  
Pascal Boyerâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦3%â€¦â€¦â€¦.2  
Spencer Wellsâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.3%â€¦â€¦â€¦.2  
Steve Sailorâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.6%â€¦â€¦â€¦.4  
Godless Capitalistâ€¦â€¦.23%â€¦â€¦â€¦15  
Scottmâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦20%â€¦â€¦..13  
Razib Khanâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..12%â€¦â€¦â€¦.8  
Jeff Percifieldâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..18%â€¦â€¦..12

total votesâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..65

As you can see, godless swept into an early lead, and no one was able to catch him. Given the small sample size, and the basically frivolous nature of the poll, there are only a few things I can sayâ€“  
1) The local talent section was much more appealing on the whole to our readers.  
2) Using a representation instead of an actual pic of the candidate did not seem to affect the respondants. The two highest scorers were portrayed by fanciful representations I chose based on my knowledge of their personalities.  
3) The romantic appeal of the masked outlaw is hard to beat. ðŸ˜‰
