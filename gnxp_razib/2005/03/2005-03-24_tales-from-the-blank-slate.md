Tales from the blank slate

Are you a director planning on filming your latest cinematic masterpiece up here in Sweden? Then you better stock up on women first.

In order to receive state funding, (which pretty much 100 percent of Swedish films depend on, go figure‚Ä¶), at least 40% of your producers, directors and script-writers better be women ‚Äì otherwise there will be no cash forthcoming.

From [‚ÄúG√∂teborgs-Posten‚Äù](http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=286&a=207740):

The memo also lays out how to correct the distorted gender distribution of the movie industry. Among other measures, a gender clause is to be introduced into the contract, where the industry commits to having at least 40 percent women filling the three important roles of director, producer or script writer, for those movies which receive state funding.

So, if any of our female readers are interested in getting into the movie business, a move to Sweden might be advisable. Sure, you‚Äôll be doing incomprehensible relational drama more than you would like, but demand for your services is certain to be brisk.
