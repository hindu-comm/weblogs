Race Does Exist — New York Times

Steve’s latest [VDARE column](http://www.vdare.com/sailer/050320_leroi.htm) is, in my opinion, a marvel of exposition. Nothing new, but like a fine wine you can move past the lack of novelty and appreciate the familiar but richly nuanced flavors.

One point that I think should be highlighted, especially in the context of Steve’s article which does much to strike a balance between stark typologies and the erasure of all variation due to clinal gradients, is the significance of “Wallace’s Line,” which putatively separates Asian and Australasian fauna in the popular imagination. In reality the chasm is [not quite so stark](http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~kjett/wallace3.htm), and many have suggested that between the Indo-Malayan and Oceanian [biogeographic realms](http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biogeography/biogeography_fundamentals.html) there is a transitional “[Wallacean](http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/wallacea/) Realm.” Wallacea is bounded by Wallace’s Line on its west and Lydekker’s Line on its east, roughly the intersection of Indo-Malayan and Oceanian fauna. Wallacea’s existence as an intermediate region between Oceania and Indo-Malaya does not render the latter classifications invalid, rather, it reenforces the reality that nature does not conform to [Platonic Ideals](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002411.html).1 Variation might be continuous, but, the rate of variation need not be constant.

1 – Recall that biologists actually dispute [species concepts](http://www.scar.utoronto.ca/~thompson/course/Speciesconceptwd.html). The species is fundamental taxonomic unit, and yet even here there is an un-Platonic mess.
