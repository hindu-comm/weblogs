An Interesting Blog I Came Across

Check out [Illuminaria’s Voice.](http://www.aclearvoice.org/index2.html) She has some interesting posts up and I was surprised to see no comments were left to any of the recent posts I read.

In her [post](http://www.aclearvoice.org/archives/2005/03/discrimination.php) on the efforts to institute a banning of abortion because the fetus is gay she does some digging on the methodology of twin studies used in support of the genetic hypothesis. She also writes:

it’s pretty hard to say that abortion is completely ok in every case, depending completely on the whim of the mother, unless her choice is affected by the child’s possible sexual orientation, or gender, or ethnicity, or whether or not it has Down’s Syndrome for that matter. If abortion is wrong, then it’s wrong no matter why the choice is made. If abortion is OK, then it’s always OK. If we’re just discarding a ball of cells that isn’t a life yet, then who cares if the ball of cells is gay or female or black?

In this [post](http://www.aclearvoice.org/archives/2005/03/police_training.php) she digs up the differential training requirements for New York area police candidates.

In this [post](http://www.aclearvoice.org/archives/2005/03/pathetic_protes.php) she takes a look at the case of LeMoyne College ‘s expulsion of a graduate student in education because he thought there was merit in the idea of corporal punishment.
