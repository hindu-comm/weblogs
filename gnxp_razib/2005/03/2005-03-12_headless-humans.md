Headless "humans"

Jody over at [PolySciFi](https://polyscifi.blogspot.com/) made an offhand comment about organ farms in the context of headless bodies. Neglecting the reality that at some point we can probably play around with stem cells and grow individual organs, I don’t get the “yuck” factor associated with this idea (I assume that a brain stem will be necessary, so they won’t be strictlly headless, correct?). One of Jody’s commentors referred to these things as “almost human.” I am surely missing something, because I can’t see how a neocortexless amalgam of cells is anything close to a human. Is someone “less human” if they lose a kidney or lung, or if their legs are amputated? I don’t see humanity as essentially about the body, rather, it is about the mind.1

Now, I’m not a “ghost in the machine” believer, but, even if you accept that position it seems that the ghost resides in the brain (?). If you are religious and believe in a soul, does this change your position? Does the soul only exist coterminously with the body, so the body is sacred as well?

1 – I get the “yuck” factor in eating human flesh, but, the reasoning behind making use of human flesh is weak since the alternatives are so copious. To my mind the yuckiness of harvesting organs from brain-stem only things is far outweighed by the enormous benefits. I can intuitively understand why people would imbue sacredness to the body after death, but it seems the body is less important the rituals that mark the passing of the self, many traditions burn and cremate the remains after all.
