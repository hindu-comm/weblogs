The classical origins of racism

An e-list on which I participate has been having a discussions of a [review](http://www.tnr.com/thisweek.mhtml) by Paula Fredriksen of the new book [The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691116911/geneexpressio-20/102-3972032-6983341). You can’t read the review online, it is behind TNR’s digital wall, though a subscriber did cut & paste it so that I have read it.

My first response is that a book with the above title makes as much sense as writing a monograph entitled “The medieval poetic roots of college ‘hook up’ culture.” In other words, broadly considered, racism is a human universal, if you take it be roughly cognate with xenophobia. Certainly the Greeks were xenophobic, but not particularly more or less xenophobic than any other ancient peoples in terms of kind (as opposed to degree). I would argue that the Romans were mildly less xenophobic than the premodern median (examples like Cato the Elder notwithstanding), their periodic expansion of the citizenship was praised by the Greek Polybius as being a source of strength and flexibility in contrast to the more constrained conception of the body politic of the polis.

One must also consider what exactly xenophobia implies. After all, it is true that the “metics” of Classical Athens were not political members of the Athenian city state. But, they dominated the commerce and contributed intellectual luminaries such as Anaxagorous, they were participants in Athenian life as opposed to subhuman chattel or outcastes. Additionally, many of these alien metics were Greeks themselves, so Hellenic xenophobia can be interpreted as less shallow in its implications (explicit, political participation, which native born slaves and women were also excluded from) and exceedingly narrow in its vision (that is, fellow Hellenes were subject to great suspicion, just as non-Greeks or semi-Greeks1 were).

I will not even consider whether the Romans were the source of modern racism, even during their Republican phase they periodically extended the franchise to notables and confederates, and I think their Republican and Augustan suspicion of things “Oriental” must be tempered by their thorough post-Augustan cosmopolitanism. But, it is important to consider what one means by “racism,” and I am not so sure that a modern concept of racism would really apply to the ancients (as opposed to xenophobia).

By this, I mean to suggest that though ancient peoples like the Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Chinese offered empirical theories about the “essential” natures of various people as conditioned by their climates or geography, it never reached a highly systematic stage.

The ancients were not naive in their understanding and knowledge of phenotypic differences, in Mary Lefkowitz’s [Not out of Africa](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046509838X/geneexpressio-20), the author points out that the ancient Greeks made a distinction between the Egyptians and northern Indians, and the Ethiopians and southern Indians, for though the two dyads are composed of populations of aproximately the same skin coloration (at least from a Hellenic vantage point), the Greeks noted that there were differences on other axes (wooly hair, generally facial features). This is the sort of insight that frankly often escapes the modern American discourse, and went to Lefkowitz’s point that Afrocentric conflation of “people of color” (Egyptians, Carthaginians, etc.) with “black” is ludicrous in the ancient context.

Nevertheless, though empirical considerations were duly noted, prescientific peoples often did not elaborate a tight and integrated racial system that they wedded to their overall ideology. Greek xenophobia is more akin to garden variety prejudices and preconceptions than a ideology of how to perpetuate the Good Life. Certainly the Greeks could have formulated such an ideology, after all, they were among the first expositers and systemetizers of “democracy” or “oligarchy.” But when it came to considerations of racial or ethnic kinds I do not think that the Greeks were exceptional or sui generis as they were in so many fields for their period (aside from a possible taxonomical precision which emerged as a byproduct of their scientific culture). A more recent historical analogy might be presented by the Chinese. Around 1900 the Confucian state was collapsing under the weight of its dead tradition and custom, and new ideas, from Christianity to Darwinism, were percolating through the intelligensia. This resulted in the formulation of a Chinese racialist ideology that borrowed most of its essential features from European racialism. Though Chinese mandarins were prejudiced about other peoples (and if you read the annals of their visits to the ancient Khmer kingdom you will note that they find the “naked blacks” exceedingly repulsive in a way that implies some racial aversion) they strongly resisted the rise of scientific racial theories, in large part because it undercut their somewhat tabula rasa biases about human nature. Confucians might be xenophobic, with biases against dark-skinned and “red haired” (Caucasian) peoples littering their literature, but they were not systematic about it.

Which moves me to a major point: I suspect that the first civilization to stumble upon the scientific method on any planet will go through a racist period. The reasoning is transparent: the scientific method results in an inflection point in terms of technological and social change, and force projection through arms. It emerges out of a careful balance between empiricism and systemetization. It seems obvious that the same mind set would observe the yawning chasm between the culture in which that mind set resides and other cultures, and systemetize it in a formula of racial-ethnic-cultural essentialism. The empirical element is clear in that a Great Chain of Being is assembled, with civilized but inferior peoples (the Chinese) a crucial rung below, and uncivilized and inferior peoples populating the lower regions of the hierarchy.

In short, I believe that what we mean by racism today is more likely a product of the scientific revolution leveraging innate human universals, as opposed to legacies drawn from ancient cultural templates. The idea that the Greeks or Romans invented racial theory that were passed down as part of their cultural inheritance seems to place a great faith in the persistence of explicit cultural forms in an substantively unaltered fashion. Long time readers of the blog will know I am skeptical of such assertions because I believe that many cognitive processes that mediate our cultural expressions reside on the non-conscious level and so are not mediated by ideology.

But, and this is a big but, I am going to engage the thesis that racism could be transmitted from ancient cultures to the present, as if it is a reasonable conjecture, and assuming that ancient “racism” is similar to modern racism, and point out what I perceive to be a flaw or blind spot in fingering the Greeks and the Romans: the modern West is a synthesis of various traditions, including the Hebraic and Germanic ones. I will neglect the last because of its relative paucity of pre-Christian literature and my suspicion that it is not relevant to the debate in any form.

I would argue that the Hebrew Bible records genocides which likely serve as far more salient cultural templates than the ideas of the Romans or Greeks. For instance:

Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

[Samuel 15:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=9&chapter=15&verse=3&version=9&context=verse).

I am of course taking the passage out of context, as the Amalekites were a nasty bunch, but it does suggest that there are portions of the Hebrew Bible which are ripe for the pickings if you want to engage in a genocide.  
This does not imply that wholesale slaughter of alien peoples is a particular trait of the ancient Hebrews, but, the deeds of the Hebrews during their sojourn in Canaan are recorded in the most widely read book in the history of the world, and, given a Divine imprimatur.2 John Hartung has a [website](http://members.aol.com/toexist/) devoted to the task of retracing the genocidal tendencies in the modern West back to the Hebrew Bible.

As I said above, I don’t think that ancient cultural templates have much to do with the rise of scientific racism and the genocides perpertrated in the name of scientific racism and cultural supremacy. Nevertheless, I think that using the term scientific racism obscures an essential reality: in many contexts racial superiority or domination was justified on Biblical, not scientific, grounds. I still hold that a “scientific mind set” and the runaway technological and social evolution triggered by the Copernican Revolution are the true roots of scientific racism, but, I also believe that for much of the period the explicit justification was rooted in elements of Christian faith, some of which drew upon the Hebrew concept of God’s convenant with a special people. The most explicit and elaborated form I can think of is the Afrikaner development of their Dutch Reformed religion, and their self-perception of being Hebrews in a pagan land filled with “Kafirs” (Canaanites?) who were not and need not be accorded the full rights of humanity because they were outside the convenant. The justifications for slavery during the antebellum South also borrowed heavily from Biblical language (as did the jeremiads of the Abolitionists, suggesting that explicit reasoning from scripture is ultimately ancillary no matter what the particulars believe). In other words, I see no particular reason to bias the explicit correlations toward pagan Greece and Rome when for much of the past 1500 years the Christian, and therefore to some extent Hebraic, religious faith was crucial in shaping the development of Western people, who also happened to pioneer scientific racism.

Which goes back to the author of the book above, and the reviewer. “Benjamin Isaac” is clearly a Jewish name, and he is a professor in Tel Aviv. To me, more importantly, Paula Fredriksen is a convert to Judaism. Let me be clear that I don’t think there is a Jewish plot to denigrate the classical pagan past, after all, the author of Not out of Africa carries the name Lefkowitz. Nevertheless, I have read a fair amount of Jewish history and religious scholarship (one of my favorite authors is [Richard Friedman](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=pd_sim_b_2/102-3972032-6983341?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Richard%20E.%20Friedman)). I have noted that there is a tendency to engage in [ethno-autism](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001967.html) among some Jews, so that there is a blind spot that might obscure obvious parallels between Greek xenophobia and Hebrew xenophobia. In an irony, if one held that Athens was paramount in its shaping influence in comparison to Jerusalem, then racism is mostly likely derived from Hellenic models. Nevertheless, I don’t think that Athens totally absorbs Jerusalem, and I think the importance of the Hebrew Bible to some Protestant groups has resulted in the use of selections from the Hebrew Bible to justify racism which ultimately is an emergent property of the scientific revolution and the mind set that it fostered.

Finally, I will end by saying that this is a weak point in the modern West’s reverence and appreciation for the classical past. It seems that attacking Greece and Rome is almost sexy, as these civilizations are the apotheosis of Dead White Maledom. I have offered before that I am personally biased toward pre-Christian Greece and Rome for a host of reasons, though I also appreciate the contributions of the Germanic tribes and Jerusalem. Ultimately, those who wish to overplay any of the columns which have held up Western civilizations must remember that there are enemies about who wish tear down the whole structure. Patriarchy, hegemony and heterosexism are easy to find on the ground in all three cultures, as they are, in almost all cultures. The revolt against Greece and Rome is not just a revolt against the Western past, it is a revolt against the present state of human nature.

And with that, I end!

1 – By which I mean heavily Hellenized peoples like the Macedonians.

2 – From where I stand it is almost certain that the records of slaughter in the Hebrew Bible are not true, but rather a mythology concocted to unify the Hebrew people.
