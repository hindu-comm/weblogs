I'll See Your Gender Sensitivity and Raise You Some Cultural Sensitivity

I can just see the Swedish PC brigades having conniptions about which side of the IKEA discrimination issue to side with. You see, the Prime Minister of Norway has leveled the charge that Sweden’s IKEA is [discriminating](http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/10/news/international/ikea.reut/index.htm?section=cnn_topstories) against women because all of IKEA’s instruction manuals depict men, or gender neutral figures, as the ones constructing the furniture.

However, IKEA feels that it isn’t some eviiilll discriminatory throwback, no indeed, rather it sees itself in the vanguard of the cultural sensitivity movement, for it eschews the depiction of women building furniture in its manuals in order to be sensitive to Muslim feelings about women’s proper roles.
