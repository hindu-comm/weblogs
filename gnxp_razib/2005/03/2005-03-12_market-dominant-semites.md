Market dominant Semites….

The [Forbes World’s Richest People rankings](http://www.forbes.com/static/bill2005/rank.html?passListId=10&passYear=2005&passListType=Person&searchParameter1=unset&searchParameter2=unset&resultsStart=1&resultsHowMany=25&resultsSortProperties=%252Bnumberfield1%252C%252Bstringfield2&resultsSortCategoryName=Rank&passKeyword=&category1=category&category2=category) just came out. One thing that jumped out at me: \#4 is a Mexican national, [Carlos Slim Helu](http://www.forbes.com/static/bill2005/LIRWYDJ.html?passListId=10&passYear=2005&passListType=Person&uniqueId=WYDJ&datatype=Person). I knew a girl who had the last name “Helou” (variant), and she wasn’t of Latin American extraction, she was Lebanese. And sure enough, he is [Lebanese Arab](http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Carlos+Slim+Hel%C3%BA&gwp=8&curtab=2222_1) by ethnicity. Not knowing any Spanish, I can’t find statistics about the overrepresentation of Arabs (usually Syrian or Lebanese of Christian faith) in the commanding heights of Latin American politics and business, but I get a definite impression that it is a “known” fact (individuals like Salma Hayek, Shakira Mebarak and Carlos Menem are too frequenty to be random sampling).

Any Latin American readers know of hard data?
