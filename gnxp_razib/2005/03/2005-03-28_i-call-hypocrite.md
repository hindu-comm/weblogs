I call hypocrite

via [Sepia Mutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001258.html)

Ted Rall’s [latest cartoon](http://www.ucomics.com/rallcom/2005/03/26/) imagines a Zoroastrian United States without separation of church and state.

What Mr. Rall leaves out of his cartoon is that the ancestral homeland of the Zoroastrians is currently under the rule of a regime repelled by the notion of separating church and state. The ancestral homeland of the Zoroastrians was invaded and the Zoroastrians subject to a campaign of ethnic cleansing by their conquerors such that the true heirs of one of the great civilizations of the ancient world may die out by the end of the twenty-first century.

Mr. Rall, of course, [casts his lot](http://www.satyamag.com/may03/rall.html) with that genocide’s perpatrators and beneficiaries.

Apparently murderous hatred of Westerners, especially Americans, gives you carte blanche for murderous hatred of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and, yes, Zoroastrians.

Stupid white man indeed.
