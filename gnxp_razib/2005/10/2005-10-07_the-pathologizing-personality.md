The Pathologizing Personality

â€œAre there large numbers of covertly â€œfascisticâ€? people in the U.S.?â€? [asks PolSci professor Alan Wolfe](http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=bcdoj568vagvtwm0j43u7x59r3d3abrl) over at the Chronicle of Higher Education. Or, put in a more academic fashion, should the old Frankfurterian study â€œThe Authoritarian Personalityâ€? be rehabilitated? Wolfe proceeds to answer in the affirmative. And how could one come to any other conclusion, considering the facts presented by Alan?

– Carl Ford Jr., a former head of intelligence within the U.S. State Department, once called John Bolton “a quintessential kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.”

– Sen. John Cornyn stated: â€œThere are some activities so flagrantly un-American that, when responsible officials won’t take the proper steps, the wide-awake citizen should take the law into his own hands.”

– House Majority Leader Tom DeLay is in difficulty for his close ties to lobbyists like Jack Abramoff.

Clearly, only a pathological authoritarian could remain unconvinced of the rise of American Fascism after being presented with such an overwhelming body of empirical evidence!
