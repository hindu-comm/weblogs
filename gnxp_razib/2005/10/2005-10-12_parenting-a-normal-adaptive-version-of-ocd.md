Parenting: A Normal, Adaptive Version of OCD

You don’t have to be mad to be a parent, but it helps. This is certainly not an original thought but it’s a truism nonetheless. Recent research is aiming to expand our insight into how parental behavior changes when children are introduced into their lives. [Dr. James Leckman](http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/faculty/leckman.htm) of the Yale University School of Medicine offers a [tantalizing glimpse](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20909-1818723,00.html) of his recent research into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:

> His plan was to hunt down the neurotransmitter that might hold the key > to OCD, in the same way that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays a > role in depression. He did chemical analyses of the cerebrospinal > fluid from OCD sufferers and found . . . nothing. >
> Rather than leave the samples languishing in the freezer, Leckman sent > them off to another researcher to check for less well-known chemicals. > â€œThe guy who examined them was amazed by the levels of oxytocin,â€? > Leckman says. Oxytocin is the hormone that tightens the parent-child > bond. Knock out the oxytocin gene in female mice, and they lose the > ability to nurse their young. Inject oxytocin into animals, and they > show grooming behaviour and an increased faithfulness to one mate. >
> â€œThe question was,â€? Leckman says, **â€œwhat did all the behaviours > associated with oxytocin, such as pair-bonding, have to do with OCD?** > Then I remembered how I behaved when my wife was pregnant with our > first child. Every time she got a fever or a cold, I had these > intrusive thoughts about harm coming to the baby. I remember my wife > cleaning all the time, even moving the refrigerator. And even though I > was a really busy medic, I found the time to build a cradle from > scratch. I just came up with the idea that \[parenting\] is a normal, > adaptive version of OCD.â€? >
> Leckman suggests that, given the high rates of infant mortality during > human evolution, **parents whose brains contained the neurocircuitry > of paranoia would be most successful at keeping their offspring alive. > When these circuits are switched on at the wrong time, he theorises, > the obsessive behaviours become problematic and result in OCD. In > particular, two variants of OCD â€” compulsive checking to ensure no > harm comes to oneâ€™s family and an inordinate desire for cleanliness > â€” are familiar to new parents.** >
> Most recently, Leckman has questioned expectant parents and new > parents on their feelings about their babies, using a method similar > to that employed to diagnose OCD. He has found that just before and > just after the birth the feelings and fears of both mothers and > fathers are strikingly reminiscent of those voiced by OCD sufferers. > He is keeping the exact results under wraps, and is preparing a paper > for publication. Interestingly, Donald Winnicott, the late English > psychoanalyst, commented in 1956 that, in order to relate to their > infants, mothers develop a heightened sensitivity that is â€œalmost an > illnessâ€?.
