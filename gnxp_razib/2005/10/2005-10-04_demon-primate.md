Demon primate

[What is a marmoset?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10553958&query_hl=9):

> Callitrichid primates typically give birth to twin offspring that are > somatic chimeras of cells derived from two products of conception. > Each individual is thus the phenotype of two sibling genotypes, one of > which may be more closely related to the germ line of the individual’s > parents than to the individual’s own germ line. Chimerism could > therefore help to explain the evolution of alloparental care and > social suppression of reproduction in callitrichids. Placental > chimerism may also have important implications for understanding kin > interactions within the womb: on one side of the coin, the intimate > juxtaposition of genotypes provides unique opportunities for > antagonistic interactions between embryos; on the other side, > chimerism could facilitate cooperation between sibling genotypes.

Perhaps you already knew marmosets were [chimeras](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Chimera), I certainly didn’t. You can read the [full paper](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/haig/pdfs/99Marmoset.pdf) (PDF)…David Haig works out some interesting genetical implications from the freaky premise. I’m not *that* disturbed on a moral level by marmoset chimerism, but I am a little surprised that a “complex” organism could habitually go through such a bizarre developmental mix & match process. Biology, the science of rules that hold, unless they don’t.
