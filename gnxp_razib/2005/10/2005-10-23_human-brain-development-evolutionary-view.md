Human brain development (evolutionary view)

I often get asked about questions regarding the size and development of the human brain in the evolutionary context, and I have a hard time remembering the material on allometry and what not that I’ve read here and there.1 But The Journal of Human Evolution has a nice paper up, [Human encephalization and developmental timing](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJS-4HB4DBK-1&_user=2148430&_handle=V-WA-A-W-WC-MsSAYZA-UUA-U-AABWZDVWVE-AABUWCCUVE-VWBCEVVCE-WC-U&_fmt=summary&_coverDate=10%2F14%2F2005&_rdoc=6&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%236886%239999%23999999999%2399999%21&_cdi=6886&amp;amp;amp;view=c&_acct=C000056308&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2148430&md5=b10d58d7be0d17caad7ae5c81a60cbac), which I’ve put up as a PDF in the [GNXP forum files](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnxpforum/files/) as “encephalization.”

1 – My primary source in [The Symbolic Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317544/geneexpressio-20/), though I’ve read other stuff in the literature….
