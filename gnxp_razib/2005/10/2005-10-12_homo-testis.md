Homo testis

This isn’t big news, but confirmation of a somewhat amusing trend, [Emergence of Young Human Genes after a Burst of Retroposition in Primates](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030357):

> …We estimate that at least one new retrogene per million years emerged > on the human lineage during the past âˆ¼63 million years of primate > evolution. Detailed analysis of a subset of the data shows that the > majority of retrogenes are specifically expressed in testis, whereas > their parental genes show broad expression patterns.

What sort of phenotypic changes would affect fitness (differential reproduction), ergo, respond to selection? You don’t have to look too high for a trait that might stick to those specifications.
