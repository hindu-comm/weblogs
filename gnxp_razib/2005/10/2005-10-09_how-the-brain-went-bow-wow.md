How the brain went bow-wow

[From wild wolf to domestic dog: gene expression changes in the brain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15249144&query_hl=5):

It is interesting to note that Nazi-sympathizing scientist1 [Konrad Lorenz](http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1973/lorenz-autobio.html) (co-inventor of modern ethology along with Nikko Timbergen) actually extrapolated from animals to humans in warning about the dangers of “domestication.” My recollection is the average wolf is more intelligent than the average domestic dog, though I am would not be surprised if the variation within dogs is great enough that border collies are brighter than the wolves that it was bred to keep an eye on.

1 – Anyone who doubts the label “Nazi-sympathizing” should read [The Ape and the Sushi Master](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465041760/geneexpressio-20/104-2493148-2227148), Frans de Waals’ series of essays about primatology and ethology where Lorenz’s history is detailed, though Waals is clearly sympathetic to the doyen of his profession and tries to make a good show of apologia via some hand waving.
