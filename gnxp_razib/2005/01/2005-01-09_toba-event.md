Toba Event

I make an ostentatious attempt on this blog to not be particularly topical in relation to “current events,” but, in light of the recent post-tsunami news tsunami, I thought some readers might find some information on the [Toba Event](http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/southeast_asia/indonesia/toba.html) interesting. This mega-explosion in central Sumatra \~70,000 years ago might have ushered in a global winter, which palaeoanthroplogist Stanely Ambrose suggests [precipitated a series of local population bottlenecks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=9650103) (more [here](http://www.jqjacobs.net/anthro/paleo/bottleneck.html)). Ambrose’s thesis basically points to Toba as the seminal event which shaped the present forms of various subpopulations which emerged out of the bottlenecks with a varied suite of specialized adaptations and features resulting from founder effect (a form of [adaptive landscape](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000629.html) theory it seems). [The Real Eve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786711922/geneexpressio-20/102-3024772-7446528), by Stephen Oppenheimer, also features the Toba Event as the watershed that separated the populations of East and West Eurasia into two clades.
