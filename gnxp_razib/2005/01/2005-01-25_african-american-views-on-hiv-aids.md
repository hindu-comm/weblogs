African American views on HIV/AIDS

I sure many of you have seen the study reported in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33695-2005Jan24.html) on AA beliefs concerning HIV. Here’s the breakdown of data:

![aids_012505.gif](https://i0.wp.com/www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/daily/graphics/aids_012505.gif?resize=228%2C633)![aids_012505.gif](https://i0.wp.com/www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/daily/graphics/aids_012505.gif?resize=228%2C633)

These beliefs are explained in the article as being based on

“This is not a bunch of crazy people running around saying they’re out to get us,” Akbar said. The belief “comes from the reality of 300 years of slavery and 100 years of post-slavery exploitation”

Akbar cited the Tuskegee experiment conducted by the federal government between 1932 and 1972. In it, scientists told black men they were being treated for syphilis but actually withheld treatment so they could study the course of the disease.

I have my doubts. In my reading of HIV/AIDS research conducted in Africa I continually find examples of similar beliefs in goups that have little connection to the slave trade or the Tuskegee experiment, as this [abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2733760) details. So to me this is less an artifact of the American experience than of a cultural remnant from Africa.
