Mongolia's reverse gender gap

I have appended an [article](http://chronicle.com/weekly/v51/i22/22a03901.htm) below on Mongolia’s reverse gender gap in higher education…but, here is one thing to note:

Looking over the scores on a recent entrance exam in the Mongolia-language department, he notes that 8 of the top 10 students are women. In economics, women are 7 of the top 10 students; in science departments, women account for about half of the top 10.

This of course follows the trend that I have observed cross-culturally, though the ratio of males to females in any given discipline tends to shift from nation to nation, the rank order seems to hold as a constant, the modal male frequency is in the sciences, in particular, the engineering sciences.

Ulan Bator, Mongolia

Dondog Natsag, a father of three daughters and three sons, is a  
typical countryside parent. When each of his sons graduated from high  
school, he put little pressure on them to continue their education.  
But when it came to his daughters, he was adamant that they should go  
on to college. “Of course it’s better for girls to go on to university,” he says.  
“Boys can always find work to do. If girls do not study, the only  
thing they can do is find a job in a sewing factory.”

Mr. Dondog expresses the sentiments of many Mongolian parents. The  
preference to send daughters to college has led to what the United  
Nations calls a “reverse gender gap” — women now make up 60 percent  
of all students at Mongolian universities. The trend is particularly  
distinctive because Asia is typically considered a place where women  
are less valued than men.

“It’s just the opposite of much of Asia. Arab and Asian students in  
other countries often don’t believe” that this could happen, says  
Solongo Algaa, a demographer at the National University of Mongolia,  
who studies the phenomenon.

Women also perform better than men at places like National University  
of Mongolia, says Davaa Suren, the university’s vice president.  
Looking over the scores on a recent entrance exam in the  
Mongolia-language department, he notes that 8 of the top 10 students  
are women. In economics, women are 7 of the top 10 students; in  
science departments, women account for about half of the top 10.  
He shrugs when asked why the gap exists: “Perhaps women are more  
hard-working.”

“Boys are lazy” seems to be the typical explanation among parents and  
other observers. But Ms. Solongo says the problem starts before  
students enter college. Young men now make up 70 percent of the  
dropouts from compulsory education. In this predominantly agricultural  
country, parents often pull their sons out of school so that they can  
help with herding duty, long considered a male responsibility.  
Boys also lack role models in schools, where 75 percent of the  
teachers are women, Ms. Solongo says. She believes that the government  
should create policies to encourage boys to stay in primary and  
secondary school.

Reversal of Fortune

Until the early 1990s, under the Soviet-style economic system, 60  
percent of the students in higher education were male. But with the  
collapse of Communism, they could resume their traditional role as  
herders of the family livestock. What’s more, changing times resulted  
in the closure of the government’s vocational and technical training  
schools. So rather than learn a trade in the capital or a smaller  
town, young men remained in the countryside, raising horses, sheep,  
and yak to feed their families and to sell the milk and meat.  
The idea that parents should pass on material possessions like herds  
and land to sons is strong in Mongolia, says the national university’s  
Ms. Solongo. But parents also believe that daughters should have some  
resources of their own, rather than be left to their own devices or  
married off to another family, which happens in many other Asian  
cultures.

Education often serves as that resource, she says. In her own family,  
for example, her sole brother inherited her parents’ apartment and now  
works in a factory, while she and her three sisters were sent to  
college and have become professionals.  
In a culture long dependent on herding and manual labor, Mongolians  
have the idea that “boys can do rougher things while girls should work  
in the office,” Ms. Solongo says.  
But advanced education for women has yet to translate into real  
economic or political power. “At the top decision levels, there are  
very few women,” says Sanjaasurengin Oyun, a leading feminist in  
Mongolia and head of the Zorig Foundation, which mobilizes the rural  
population to vote.

Of the 76 parliamentary seats in Mongolia, only 5 are occupied by  
women. “Employers would rather hire males than females,” says  
Altantsetseg Sodnomtseren, an expert on higher education at the  
National University of Mongolia. Upon graduation from college, men  
have a much easier time finding jobs than women, says Ms.  
Altantsetseg.

Nevertheless, many women entering Mongolia’s higher-education system  
display confidence that it’s a woman’s world. Tsedendamba Amartavshin,  
who lives in a felt tent called a ger in the countryside near Ulan  
Bator, enrolled in the Agriculture University last fall.  
Of her four siblings, all boys, only one has also chosen to go on to  
higher education. “The girls are just dominating the university,” she  
says. “And by having a good education, we’ll have a good living.”
