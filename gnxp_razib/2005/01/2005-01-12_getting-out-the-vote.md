Getting Out the Vote

I’d like to remind gnxpers that the polls are open at Aziz’s Brass Crescent Awards and (shocka!) razib is nominated for Best Thinker. You can vote [here](http://altmuslim.com/brasscrescent.php).

Also, our own David Boxenhorn is nominated in several categories at Israellycool, but the polls are not open there yet.
