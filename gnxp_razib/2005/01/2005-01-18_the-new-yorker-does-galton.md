The New Yorker Does Galton

Considering that the New Yorker skews its content to appeal to its leftist readership I was expecting the worst, but this [review](http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/?050124crbo_books) of Extreme Measures: The Dark Visions and Bright Ideas of Francis Galton by Martin Brookes comes off as quite complementary. Jim Holt, the author of the piece reviews Galton’s early life, his monumental breakthrough in developing the discipline of statistics, some of his idiosyncracies (developing submarine spectacles to allow him to read while submerged in his bath), and takes on the issue of eugenics and fairly makes note of the distinction between positive and negative eugenics. He also treads carefully into the future of germline therapy.

Except for a zinger or two towards the end of the article, Holt doesn’t smear Galton as many leftists are wont to do.

Noteworthy in the article is an extended review of [regression to the mean](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002573.html) and an explanation of [Galton’s Fallacy](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003273.html) as well as reporting the charge that Galton himself committed the fallacy. I’m sure that David B. will make a bee-line for this article and I look forward to his comments.
