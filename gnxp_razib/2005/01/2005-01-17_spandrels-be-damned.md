Spandrels, be damned

[David Geary](http://www.missouri.edu/~psycorie/)‘s new book, [The Origin Of The Mind: Evolution Of Brain, Cognition, And General Intelligence  
](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591471818/geneexpressio-20) will be of great interest to (almost) all readers of this compendium o’ prose. Its content, while not particularly novel to gnxp (e.g., [1](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003394.html), [2](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003368.html)), is a massive defense of the idea that intelligence (or, more specifically, g) specifically evolved due to the advantages it gives in (social) problem solving and purposeful planning.

I can’t go into much of a review at this time, but I’ll say that the book’s final two chapters (Evolution of general intelligence, and General intelligence in modern society) are superb reviews and integration of current g literature and Evolutionary (Cognitive) Psychology. If you afford it, buy a copy today. If not, march down to your closest library and demand that they purchase a copy.
