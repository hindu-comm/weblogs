Fame & Victimization: A Toxic Brew

Just a quick follow-up to my [previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003561.html) on the persecution of UNLV professor Hans Hermann Hoppe. It seems that the professor’s accuser has gone public and is reveling in his new found fame as the victim of Hoppe’s remarks.

Michael Knight, the UNLV student, was hoping that Dr. Hoppe would have to submit to sensitivity and diversity training as penance for his crime. Knight has a [blog](http://www.livejournal.com/users/aquariusguy702/) where he shares with us his plans for TV news conferences and his other plans concerning the Hoppe Affair. This [blog entry](http://www.livejournal.com/users/aquariusguy702/21781.html) has a number of commenters taking Knight to task for his complaint. Very interesting reading.

While I haven’t read the entire blog, what amazed me was this kid’s preoccuption with, and elevation of, sensitivity and identity validation over concepts like academic freedom and free speech. Of course that’s not entirely a surprise, considering the state of many school curricula, which nurture the intellects and values of their students with a steady diet of intellectual pablum, and then send them out into the real world. So, why should we expect any different?
