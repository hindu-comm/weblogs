Psychoanalytic Temporality and Development

(All information in this blog post was found in an Advertisement in the Febuary 13, 2005 edition of the Imblerian, so nothing improper is being posted on this blog)

A Lecture by Dr. Jeanne Chasseguet

Quote from advertisement A rebellion against the biological order seems to have silently infiltrated our world view. Suicide bombers appear to share with writers such as Mishima, Pasolini and Foucault a fascination with destruction. A liberation from the body to reestablish a- possibly mystical-union of soul and cosmos and an assertion of the mind’s omnipotence appear to be common features of behaviors that seem to be taken for granted in contemporary thought. Is the new misogyny, which rejects motherhood in the name of feminism, contributing in any way to these trends? This review of our society by a woman psychoanalyst–a non-medic and graduate of the Institut d’Etudes Politques in Paris–presents a sharp and rigorous analysis of the strange and violent menchanisms that are erupting in the world today.

A public lecture on Feb 26 2005 at 8 am at OHSU, I might go.
