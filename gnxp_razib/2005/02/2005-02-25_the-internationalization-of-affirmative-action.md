The Internationalization of Affirmative Action

Whatever you may think of Affirmative Action now, its genesis was noble (though misguided) in intent – to right the wrongs of the past and to equalize the paths to success for members of discriminated racial groups. I would imagine that those who wrote the legislation thought that the program would have a finite life and would end when the wrongs of the past had been righted.

However, University administrators, in their striving for diversity, are doing their best to insure that Affirmative Action never sees a sunset. (surprise!) They are recruiting students internationally to meet their diversity goals.

A quick Google reveals that the [University of Chicago](http://maroon.uchicago.edu/news/articles/2004/10/24/low_minority_populat.php):

The University also visits Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and non-U.S. territories in the Caribbean such as Jamaica to recruit students,

The New York Times in their [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/21/nyregion/21africa.html?ex=1266728400&en=6a8081504c2631f4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) reporting on the historic milestone of more Africans now coming to the US per year than during the slave trade. The article touches on many interesting facets of this demographic issue, and I’ll quote a few passages, but buried in the article is a quote by a Harvard Law Professor.

The steady decline in the percentage of African-Americans with ancestors who suffered directly through the middle passage and Jim Crow is also shaping the debate over affirmative action, diversity programs and other initiatives intended to redress the legacy of slavery.

\[ . . . . .\]

The flow from Africa began in the 1970’s, mostly with refugees from Ethiopia and Somalia, and escalated in the 1990’s, when the number of black residents of the United States born in sub-Saharan Africa nearly tripled. Combined with the much larger flow of Caribbean blacks, the recent arrivals from Africa accounted for about 25 percent of black population growth in the United States over all during the decade. Nationally, the proportion of blacks who are foreign born rose to about 7.3 percent from 4.9 percent in the 1990’s. In New York City, about 1 in 3 blacks are foreign born.

\[ . . . . \]

Those numbers reflect only legal immigrants, who have been arriving at the rate of about 50,000 a year, first mostly as refugees and students and more recently through family reunification and diversity visas. Many speak English, were raised in large cities and capitalist economies, live in families headed by married couples and are generally more highly educated and have higher-paying jobs than American-born blacks.

There is no official count of the many others who entered the country illegally or have overstayed their visas and who are likely to be less well off.

Kim Nichols, co-executive director of the African Services Committee, which directs newcomers to health care, housing and other services in the New York region, estimates that the number of illegal African immigrants dwarfs the legal ones. “We think it’s a multiple of at least four,” she said.

\[ . . . . . \]

Sylviane A. Diouf, a historian and researcher at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center and Dr. Dodson’s co-author of “In Motion,” said that Americans have a more positive view of immigrants in general than they do of American-born blacks. Referring to African immigrants, she said: “They are better educated, they’re here to work, to prosper, they’re more compliant and don’t pose a threat.”

Dr. Dodson added, “They’re not politically mobilized as yet and not as closely tied to the African-American agenda.”

\[ . . . . \]

“I think there is a legitimate set of specific claims by persons born in the United States that don’t necessarily apply to Caribbean or African populations that have come here subsequently,” Dr. Dodson said.

“African-born and Caribbean-born brothers and sisters have realized that the police don’t discriminate on the basis of nationality – ask Amadou Diallo,” said Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr., who teaches at Harvard Law School and has warned colleges and universities that admitting mostly foreign-born blacks to meet the goals of affirmative action is insufficient.

The charge made by Prof. Ogletree is the same one we [posted](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002642.html) about in August.

What exactly justifies granting preferential treatment to voluntary immigrants and their children, none of whom really should be the beneficiaries of society’s efforts to redress past wrongs?
