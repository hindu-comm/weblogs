A muddled confusion

About a week ago I got hyperpedantic [over at Aziz’s blog](https://dean2004.blogspot.com/2005/02/anti-shiism.html) about the term “Shia.” I have far less interest in foreign affairs that most people, and likely the the average GNXP reader, **but**, I do get concerned with the mental algebra that people use in making predictions and models based on their understanding of terms. What I mean is that “Shiism” is a token that gets slotted into the analogy Iraq + Shiism \~ Iran + Shiism. My objection seems rather pedantic and overly particular, but **these terms matter because poor mental algebra and analogy has world changing consequences**. I have disputed the validity of the Shia-Sunni Catholic-Protestant analogy [before](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001977.html), but I will assert something which I have come to believe after reading [Mullahs on the Mainframe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226056775/geneexpressio-20/102-3024772-7446528?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=2025&link%5Fcode=xm2) (an ethnography of Aziz’s Daudi Bohra Islami Shia sect), **to the first aproximation “Shia” should actually not be considered anything more than Muslims who do not fall under the term Sunni**. The implication is that Shiism has little coherent centrality aside from an emphasis on Ali.
