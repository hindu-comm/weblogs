The Biological Basis of Multiple Orgasms

There‚Äôs been a lot of high talk lately about how the XX are poorly represented in the fields of mathematics and physics (see razib‚Äôs seminal (heh) post [Much Ado about Women and Larry Summers](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003491.html)). Yet actually women are biologically superior to men in many aspects, including tolerance of heat, cold, pain and radiation. Women are also far less likely than men to fall asleep after the sex act, according to David Wilkes in [Why Men Fall Asleep After Sex](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/menshealth.html?in_article_id=338126&in_page_id=1800&in_a_source=) .

Wilkes says:‚ÄùThe blood rush after climax depletes the muscles of energy-producing glycogen, leaving men feeling physically drained. ‚ÄúBecause they have more muscle mass than women, men become tired after sex and this subsequently leads to them feeling sleepy.‚ÄùAnother benefit of that extra X is the capacity for multiple orgasms. Is this a spandrel, or possibly an incentive to increased reproductive potential? I think there needs to be more research! But how to keep men awake long enough to research this?Wilkes also suggests:‚ÄùHave sex out of the bedroom, away from the usual sleeping environment, or play uplifting music ‚Äì not the usual romantic sounds,‚Äù An anonymous source also told me that keeping the lights on can have excellent results.But what sort of music would work the best? I don‚Äôt think I could tolerate any of Wilkes‚Äô suggestions: I Feel Good by James Brown, Elvis Presley‚Äôs A Little Less Conversation or Britney Spears‚Äôs Toxic. So, umm, I have a poll! And if you have other suggestions for good stay awake music, please put them in the comments. üòâ
