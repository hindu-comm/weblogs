"Phoenicians"

Last fall PBS aired a special, [Quest for the Phoenicians](http://www.pbs.org/previews/phoenicians/), with Spencer Wells. Via [this page](http://phoenicia.org/genetics.html) I find that one of Wells’ most interesting discoveries is that the island of Malta seems to exhibit a high frequency of haplotypes which suggest a Levantine origin within the past few thousand years. If you [watch this video](http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature2/#) (control-f “from geneticist Spencer Wells”), note that Wells excludes an Islamic or “Neolithic farming” source for these haplotypes, so by a process of exclusion the Phoenicians seem the most plausible candidates. Seeing that Malta is a small and somewhat isolated island, it should be no great surprise that the frequency of Levantine Y lineages might be higher here than around ancient Carthage in modern Tunisia, which likely had a far larger native substrate and was subject to continuous genetic exchange with the hinterland for thousands of years after Cato’s work was done.

Now, someone might want to [tell this guy](http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=912) about the origins of his adopted co-nationals.
