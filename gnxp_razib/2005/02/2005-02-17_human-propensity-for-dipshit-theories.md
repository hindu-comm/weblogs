[Steve Verdon](http://www.steveverdon.com/archives/evolutioncreationism/002086.html) points us to what might be the latest incarnation of Intelligent Design methodology – the Global Consciousness Project, which uses a random number generator to predict the future, like when anomalous readings 4 hours prior to the 9/11 attacks “predicted” the attacks.

Oh, there’s so much wrong with this.
