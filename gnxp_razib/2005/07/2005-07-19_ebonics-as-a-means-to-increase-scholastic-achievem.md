Ebonics as a means to increase scholastic achievement for Black students

Article in the [San Bernardino News](http://www.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,208~12588~2969790,00.html) suggesting [Ebonics](http://www.stanford.edu/~rickford/ebonics/EbonicsExamples.html) as a way to raise academic achievement for Black students.

There are so many things wrong in that article, I’ll stick the two most basic that it is hard to believe I have to state them:

1\) I would like to see ***one***, data-backed and independently tested (i.e., subject to peer-review and multiple investigations) theory that posits speaking Ebonics either a) keeps Black students interested in core academics (e.g., math, reading, chemistry) above and beyond the norm or b) has a positive effect on college admissions to mildly selective universities. Note, I didn’t say a thing about raising IQ scores, which is really what this whole thing is all about.

2\) The article says:

> A pilot of the policy, known as the Students Accumulating New > Knowledge Optimizing Future Accomplishment Initiative, has been > implemented at two city schools.

Have any results been published? Can I have access to the data? Or is this going to be another [fraud in the name of social justice.](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0898598362/individuladif-20/002-6422678-0994434)

I searched PsychInfo and the Internet in general (i.e., [Google](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Students+Accumulating+New+Knowledge+Optimizing+Future+Accomplishment+Initiative%22) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22Students+Accumulating+New+Knowledge+Optimizing+Future+Accomplishment+Initiative%22)) and found **not one** article, much less a peer-reviewed one, with the following key words: “Students Accumulating New Knowledge Optimizing Future Accomplishment Initiative” or “Mary Texeira”.

I challenge anyone involved in this project to give citations of where the public can go to review a) their research design, b) their data collection instrumentation, and (if available) c) their analysis.

Until such a time, this effort, to paraphrase [KA](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426686/), will have to be classified as ass.
