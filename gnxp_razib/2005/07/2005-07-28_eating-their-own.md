Eating their own

Seems like there is some intellectual cannibalism going on over on the Left. The [Savage Minds](http://www.savageminds.org/) anthropology weblog is being stomped on from all angles of the Progressosphere because they dared to point a sharp object at Jared Diamond. Kerim has [the round up](http://savageminds.org/2005/07/26/guns-germs-and-steel-links/). He [pointed to us](http://savageminds.org/index.php?s=ashkenazi&submit=Search) back when Greg & Henry’s paper broke and I appreciate that, but my experience on that weblog is that it has a pretty standard liberal slant, so I’m sure this episode of being broadsided by big names in the Progressosphere must be somewhat surreal. Anyway, the [original post](http://savageminds.org/2005/07/24/anthropology%e2%80%99s-guns-germs-and-steel-problem/) that started this actually referenced [Guns, Germs and Gonads](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003206.html), you know, to show the racist perspective. Also check out Henry Farrell’s [post](http://crookedtimber.org/2005/07/28/cultivating-ignorance/). I think I agree with him that Ozma does throw around the term “racist” in a cavalier fashion. Shit gets complicated when you are trying to stay on the politically correct side all the time.

**Addendum:** Since I’ve been a bit priggish about concepts, categories and precision recently, I will admit I probably elided over great differences within what I termed the “Progressosphere” because I’m not too political and my own inclinations are pretty orthogonal to the center to Left axis. So yeah, they aren’t all Muguloos.
