Play with meiosis

One of the main reasons this site is around is to make basic genetic knowledge a casual background feature of the data bases of people who would otherwise not know much about this important science (another reason, at least for me, is to dump a lot of historical and non-science data out there to a scientifically literate audience so they can better form models which influence their view of public policy). So in that spirit, check out [Using Karyotypes to Predict Genetic Disorders](http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/units/disorders/karyotype/karyotypeinfo.cfm) (it has some neat interactive movies, though if you know genetics, don’t worry about it, but if you have been skipping the science posts for lack of a basic background, I advise you check out the link). Remember, to the first approximation it all starts out on basic Mendelian principles.
