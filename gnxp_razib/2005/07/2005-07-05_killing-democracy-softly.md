Killing democracy softly

Just [another brief report](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?%20=147&a=435544&previousRenderType=6) from the front lines in the never-ending struggle against free speech.

The following sentence from a personal e-mail to an elected official will get you indicted for “hate speech” in Sweden:

“I demand that you take part of the money that you and your damn sosse\*colleagues spend on ‘criminal Mohammed’ in Rosengård and spend them on our swedish retirees instead”

as will:

“…cease your huge subsidies to all damn darkies in Malmö”

The question is only at what point the term “democracy” becomes a misnomer for political systems that systematically use the power of the state to suppress a certain competing ideology or viewpoint.

For more thoughts on the matter, here are a couple of posts on the subject from a while back:

[“Off to the Catacombs?”](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003495.html)

\*: “sosse” = “social democrat” = ruling party in Malmö and Sweden.
