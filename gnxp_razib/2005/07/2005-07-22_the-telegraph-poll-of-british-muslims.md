The Telegraph poll of British Muslims

I figured I’d just reformat the [poll results](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/23/npoll23.xml&sSheet=/portal/2005/07/23/ixportal.html) from The Telegraph that are making the rounds.

Q: Which of these views comes closest to your own?

32%- A great deal of responsibility  
34%- Some responsibility

14%- None at all  
1% – Don’t know

I left the last three poll questions off because I don’t think they were that interesting and this post is a bit long. You can find them at the link above. My only comment is that many of these people expressing sympathetic opinions about the terrorists must be grotesquely stupid, since they surely knew that the results would be made public and perhaps generate further animus toward their community as a whole.
