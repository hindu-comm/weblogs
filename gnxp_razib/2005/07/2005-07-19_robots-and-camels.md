Robots and camels

[Robots replace child jockeys in Arab camel race](http://news.com.com/Robots+replace+child+jockeys+in+Arab+camel+race/2100-7337_3-5793947.html?tag=nefd.top). Don’t liberal do-gooders know that families in Bangladesh depend on the remittances sent by the child jockeys?

Update: Just want to make clear, the initial post was meant in mirth. I really didn’t know how serious the whole “camel jockey” thing was.
