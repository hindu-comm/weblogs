Robert D. Kaplan on C-SPAN

Robert D. Kaplan is [going to be the guest on this week’s In Depth program](http://www.booktv.org/indepth/index.asp?segID=5376&schedID=339) on C-SPAN 2 from 12-3 PM on April 3. Although his influence is not publicized quite as much as, say, the neocons, his extensive writings have been extremely influential within military and government circles. This is probably going to be the longest public interview he has done, so check it out.

Addendum: For those who missed the show, C-SPAN will have a streaming video version [posted here within the week](http://www.booktv.org/indepth/index.asp?segID=5376&schedID=339).
