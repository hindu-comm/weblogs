Whole population genome analysis

[Method devised for whole-population DNA analysis](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L19708932.htm). Seems more like a press release by the founder of a new biotech company than anything else, but there is [more](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc%5Fwtx024660.html) at The Wellcome Trustâ€™s website. The projected company seems like it is looking to capitalize on the window of opportunity before the rise of truly personal genomics and leverage populational level differences data toward medical applications. Nevertheless, apropos of some [discussions](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003917.html) on this site, this method might have more purely intellectual relevance.
