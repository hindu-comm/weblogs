Beauty

[Steve](http://isteve.com/) isn’t sure that variance of mutational load1 betweein individuals is responsible for important differences in beauty. Well, no doubt it isn’t responsible for the whole range of aesthetic countenance, but I would be curious to see how much it accounts for differences within a range of siblings.

Here is the equation for mutation-selection balance of deleterious recessives:

In other words, the equilibrium frequency of q (the presumptive non-wild type) is \~ the square root of the mutation rate divided by the selection coefficient. Here is the [derivation](http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/ib162/Mutation.htm).

Obviously for a single locus the frequency for a potentionally lethal allele is rather low within the population, but consider the circumstance where you have a trait where the developmental stability and expression is tightly controlled by a wide range of loci. Remove lethality of a homozygote and assume additivity (so that deleterious mutations are not masked by a “good copy”). Complex organisms like human beings are a literal flux of bubbling mutational froth against which selection [barely keeps up](http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/mu/node12.html).

I have mentioned before that evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller has suggested that the human brain is so overdeveloped because it serves as a signal for mutational load, so many genes contribute to the cognitive phenotype that the character of the mind is a reasonable proxy for the overall health of the genome. Of course physical beauty is another assessment of genetic health, as only individuals with low a mutational load can devote the resources to the expression of a gaudy and aesthetically extravagant phenotype.

This is all an excuse to post two pictures of Jessica Alba below the fold.

1 – I was sloppy with definitions and used the term “genetic load” before when I was speaking in the individual context when this term is usually used in a populational context. Sorry.
