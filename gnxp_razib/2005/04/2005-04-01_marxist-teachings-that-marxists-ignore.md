Marxist teachings that Marxists ignore‚Ä¶

I never, ever thought that I would be quoting a Communist on this blog, but I just have to point out this quote from Friedrich Engels:

We regard economic conditions as the factor which ultimately determines historical development. But race is itself an economic factor.

Of course, after looking at numerous other writings of Engels, the guy starts to sound like a proto-Nazi. An extremely long list of extremely un-PC quotations by Marx and Engels can be found on John Jay Ray‚Äôs ‚Äú[Marx & Friends in their own words](https://marxwords.blogspot.com/)‚Äù blog. I recommend everyone checking it out and, if in college, sending the link to your favorite Marxist professor. üôÇ
