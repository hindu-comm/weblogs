Question of the day

What makes a Firefly’s tail glow?

(I’m pretty sure Razib knows the answer, so I’ll ask him to sit this one out)

UPDATE OK That one was easy and AG got it in the comments, so I’ll ask a second question: why is complete COX-2 inhibition not a good thing? (COX-2 is the protein implicated in colon, breast and prostate cancer for which drugs such as Vioxx inhibit)
