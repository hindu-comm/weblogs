Brains on Minds

Ronald Bailey, of Reason Magazine, [reports](http://www.reason.com/links/links041805.shtml) on a 3-day conference with prominent neuroscientists and theologians called [”Our Minds and Us”](http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/neuroscience/index.shtml). Concerned subjects are: Mind-brain duality, bioethics involved in understanding which structures of the brain are involved in things like violence and depression, and existential questions of “What is the self”. Check it out.
