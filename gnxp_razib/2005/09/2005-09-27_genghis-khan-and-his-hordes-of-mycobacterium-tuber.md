Genghis Khan and his hordes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Apparently Genghis, et. al., had a few stowaways:

> A report in the October issue of Genome Research suggests that Genghis > Khan’s invasions spanning the continent of Asia during the 13th > century may have been a primary vehicle for the dissemination of one > of the world’s most deadly diseases: tuberculosis…. >
> Mokrousov’s team hypothesized that, given the strong gender bias of TB > infectivity and the likely family-based mode of TB transmission during > pre-industrialized times, M. tuberculosis dissemination has reflected > the unidirectional inheritance of the paternally transmitted human Y > chromosome. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared the genetic > profiles of a common form of M. tuberculosis, called the Beijing > genotype, with known patterns of prehistoric and recent human > migrations, as well as with global patterns of Y-chromosome variation. >
> Strikingly, they observed that over the past 60,000-100,000 years, the > dispersal and evolution of M. tuberculosis appears to have precisely > ebbed and flowed according to human migration patterns.

Further:

> The authors describe how the Beijing genotype of M. tuberculosis > originated in a specific human population called the K-M9 in central > Asia approximately 30,000-40,000 years ago following a second “out of > Africa” migration event. The bacteria and its human host then > disseminated northeast into Siberia between 20,000-30,000 years ago > and throughout eastern Asia between 4,000-10,000 years ago. More > recently, the Beijing genotype of M. tuberculosis was introduced into > northern Eurasia, perhaps by Genghis Khan himself during the 1200’s, > and into South Africa, possibly through sea trade contacts with > Indonesia or China during the last 300 years.
