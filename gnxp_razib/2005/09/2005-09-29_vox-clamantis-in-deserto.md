Vox Clamantis in Deserto

[Joanne Jacobs](http://www.joannejacobs.com/mtarchives/015579.html) points to a new blogger, [Newoldteacher](https://schoolnerdblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/i-heart-knowledge.html), a graduate student in education. Hers is a voice crying out in the wilderness of education graduate programs:

> My professor is a real history professor from the real university I > attend. He specializes in modern Islam and European colonialism in the > Middle East. He wears bow-ties, tells us we’re wrong, criticizes us > when we stay stupid things, and generally emits an air of effortless > superiority. It’s absolutely awesome. Finally, someone who values > knowledge, who doesn’t believe it’s just a useless jumble of unrelated > baubles. He’s brilliant, and it’s obvious that he’s brilliant because > he knows so much. It’s not that he’s used “transfer skills” from > critical thinking projects he did as a kid. No. He studied for god > knows how long in libraries across America, the Middle East, and > Europe. He learned other languages and lived in other cultures, and he > just knows his shit. Today he gave a narrative of the last few years > in American life that was brief but so incisive I felt I would tear > up. I hate that my school doesn’t think this type of intellectualism > is worth anything. The guy in my class who was so pro-constructivism, > he said “our schools produce kids who are good at school.” First off, > most of them don’t. Second, what is wrong with that?

Joanne note that *Newoldteacher, who hopes to teach social studies, thinks it’s more valuable to know things than to be able to “make a model space station out of plastic pipes and rubber tubing.”*
