Thomas Friedman: Brains vs. Language

Thomas Friedman [speaking yesterday](http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200509220122.html) in the Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun*:

> **Funabashi:** Among the emerging Asian countries, India seems to have > an advantage in globalization because of its citizens’ high English > ability. But there are reports that as many as 350 million people are > now studying English in China. In a globalizing world, how does > English ability impact on a country’s potential? >
> **Friedman:** Knowing English was an early advantage for India in a > couple of areas. One is, obviously, call centers, where you had to > know English to serve an English-speaking company. But today, the > second-largest outsourcing capital in the world is Dalian, China, > where thousands of Japanese-speaking Chinese are now running the > backrooms and writing the software of major Japanese multinationals > and American multinationals formerly based in Tokyo. And, as I’m sure > people here are aware, there are Japanese language schools on every > other corner in Dalian. Japanese language is now required for two > years at many schools in Dalian, and I would hardly say that speaking > English in Dalian today is a great advantage. In fact, speaking > Japanese would be a huge advantage. That’s the first point I would > make. >
> The second point I would make is that **in terms of hard-core business > processes, so much of this is about writing code and things of that > nature, that I believe at the end of the day business will go to where > the brains are and not where the language is. *You will meet companies > today in the United States who have already skipped over India and > gone right to China for basically the next generation of business > process engineering.*** >
> In working on my book, I interviewed Bill Gates, and he told me that > Microsoft opened its third research center in the world in Beijing in > 1998. It used to just have a research center in Cambridge, England, > nice English-speaking place, and Redmond, Washington. **He told me > they opened their research center in China by giving IQ tests to 2,000 > Chinese around the country, Ph.D.s and engineering students, > recommended to them, and out of those 2,000 they basically chose 20 to > open the research center in China.** >
> Now, think what it is actually to be one of those 20 out of a country > of 1.3 billion people. In fact, they have a saying at the Microsoft > Research Center in China: In China, when you’re one in a million, > there are 1,300 other people just like you. >
> **Now, what Bill Gates will also tell you is that today the China > Research Center is the leading research center in Microsoft. You know > what he’ll also tell you, though? He’ll tell you that Microsoft’s best > game designers all come from Japan.** I bet none of them speak > English, or very few. So, I don’t think this is going to be about > language. I think the language advantage is going to quickly be > arbitraged out. There’ll be more Chinese speakers on the Internet > very, very soon.
