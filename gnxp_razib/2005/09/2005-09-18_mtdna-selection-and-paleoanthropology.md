mtDNA, selection and paleoanthropology

John has an [interesting post](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/ruiz-pesini_selection_mtdna_2004.html) up which reviews data that certain high latitude mtDNA lineages might confer a functional advantage via reduced metabolic overhead and greater longevity. Of course, as John notes, not only does this have great relevance for the deep-time history of our species, it is going to be a serious issue for the possibility of future paperback editions of [The Seven Daughters of Eve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393323145/geneexpressio-20/002-4616924-4272818) or [The Real Eve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786711922/geneexpressio-20/002-4616924-4272818) (since they assume neutrality for mtDNA, ergo, it gives us an unbiased phylogenetic map).
