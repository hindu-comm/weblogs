More on jobs & Ph.D.s

First, I’m sure that the blue-collar readers of this weblog are thinking “cry me a river.” Yes, American scientists (perhaps excluding engineers, and to a lesser extent pharmaceutical researchers) are generally Left-liberal, but the collapse of the American working class due to globalization is something that they fixate on only as part of a broader political vision, along with other concerns. **But when it comes to tenure-track jobs, the end is nigh!** Consider that the woman who seems to have “wasted” a neuroscience Ph.D. in yesterday’s *Washington Post* article now has a job in academic administration. This is the sort of failure that manual laborers and factory workers alike would probably kill for.

But in any case, some more posts for you. Reader [Miko](http://rxnm.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/job-search/) reflects on searching for a job, [Mike the Mad Biologist](http://mikethemadbiologist.com/2012/07/09/the-stem-phd-glut-makes-the-mainstream-media/) keeps doing his thing, and fellow *Discover* blogger Julianne on [Subtleties of the Crappy Job Market for Scientists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/07/09/subtleties-of-the-crappy-job-market-for-scientists/):

More succinctly, I think the ***average*** physicist is smarter than the *average* biologist. More to the point,[some of my friends crunching through large data sets](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) have plenty of transferableskills. There are biologists, and then there are biologists. Go figure out how to manipulate a [data frame](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/data.frame.html) while your gel is running.
