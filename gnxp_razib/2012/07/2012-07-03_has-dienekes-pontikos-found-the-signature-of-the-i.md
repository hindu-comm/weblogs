Has Dienekes Pontikos found the signature of the Indo-Europeans?

I don’t know the answer to the question posted in title above, and I’m moderately skeptical that he has. **But I wanted to give him full credit in the public record if researchers confirm his findings in the next few years.** You can read the [full post at his weblog](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2012/07/indo-european-genetic-signatures-in.html), but basically he found that a West Asian modal element in a north British (Orkney) and Lithuanian individual seems to be negatively correlated with a Northwest European modal element and positively correlated with Near Eastern and South Asian components on a genomic level across different models in ADMIXTURE (e.g., does “South Asian” at K = 5 tend to match “West Asian” at K = 8).

Two major concerns:

  
– I don’t have a good intuition for this method. Could this be an artifact of the algorithm?

– **When you have a hypothesis in mind you can unconsciously seek out confirmatory points.** As you can see in the [comments below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/the-mystery-of-the-origin-of-the-indo-europeans-may-be-solved-within-the-next-2-years/#comments) Dienekes and his interlocutors have given this issue much thought. Frankly, I found it difficult to follow a lot of the dialogue, and I follow this topic more than most.

It seems that at this point someone should do follow up analyses with other populations, assuming that the method is informative.
