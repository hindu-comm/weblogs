On the effects of effective population

[Nathaniel Pearson](http://genomena.com/ne/) has an [eminently readable post up](http://genomena.com/ne/) on [human effective population sizes](http://genomena.com/ne/). If you don’t know the importance of [harmonic means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) in this domain, worth a read. He finishes though with an issue of practical importance, the proliferation of individually deleterious alleles at the large census sizes we see us today:

> Along the way, our changing population size may shape public health in > complex ways. In particular, a key question will be what happens to > the likely sizable subset of newly arisen rare variants that pose > health risks to people who carry them. As our population continues to > skyrocket, more such variants will come into our midst. >
> **At the same time, continued population growth should ultimately help > natural selection purge such variants more efficiently than it can in > a small population** (where chance dominates the fate of variants, > harmful or not). >
> But, to the extent that our future population growth itself depends on > further advances in healthcare, we’ll also be altering the regime of > such natural selection, ideally relaxing it in ways that help people > live healthier lives no matter what variants they carry in their > genomes.

As Mark Ridley observed in [The Cooperative Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201612/geneexpressio-20) **natural operates *in utero*as well.** Even assuming that natural selection is not purging deleterious alleles with great efficiency today, high human miscarriage rates are going to serve as a counterbalance to better healthcare for the genetically less fit.\*

\* On the order of \~50% of pregnancies miscarry, with the majority being cryptic, as women may not have known that fertilization occurred due to failure of implantation or problems in the first month).
