Genetic counseling and conflict of interest

[Article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/business/conflict-potential-seen-in-genetic-counselors-paid-by-testing-companies.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print) in *The New York Times*:

> Genetic testing raises some vexing ethical questions, like whether it > will cause unnecessary anxiety or lead to more medical procedures, > including abortions. >
> Now, as the number of tests and the money to be made from them are > exploding, another question is being asked by professionals in the > field themselves. Is it ethical for genetic counselors, who advise > patients on whether to undergo testing, to be paid by the companies > that perform the tests? >
> While it might not always be immediately obvious to patients, some > counselors offering them advice in hospitals and doctors’ offices work > for the commercial genetic testing companies, not for the hospitals or > doctors themselves.

Conflict of interest in anything medical is pretty bad. On the other hand, medical care is expensive. But I want to add something here: **the pre-natal screens by Genzyme are really, really, bad value-for-cost.** For example, a non-insurance “sticker price” of thousands of dollars for 200 traits. Speaking from personal experience here. Also, don’t think you can ever get genetic material sent to Genzyme back. I called and tried this for a few months, and there was no response (I wanted to do typing of tissue myself).
