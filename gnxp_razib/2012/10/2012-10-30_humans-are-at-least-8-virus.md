Humans are at least 8% virus

In the comments [below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/10/prop-37-and-the-right-to-have-the-government-enforce-your-right-to-know/) there is a lot of talk about the worry of transferring gene X from organism 1 to organism 2, where the two organisms are very far apart on the tree of life. I’m a little sanguine about this, but that’s because **there is already much of this going on through natural processes.**

Carl Zimmer for example points out that [8 percent of the human genome seems to derive from endogenous retroviruses](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/06/14/we-are-viral-from-the-beginning/) (the post draws on material from his book [A Planet of Viruses](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226983366//geneexpressio-20)). This is probably a low bound number, as he notes in the comments. Additionally, this isn’t just limited to viruses. See: [Horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and animals](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334091).

I think on of the chasms between geneticists and the public is that a lot of things that seem creepy and strange to the public are part & parcel of the geneticist’s professional toolkit. For example, to my knowledge no [transgenic mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_mouse) have turned into [the Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain#Characters). I have friends that order weird mouse varieties, and then do weirder things to them, every week.
