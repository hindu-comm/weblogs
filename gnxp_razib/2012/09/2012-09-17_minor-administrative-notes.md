Minor administrative notes

I’m a bad man, cluttering this weblog with administrative notices. But sometimes it needs to be done.

1\) In case you don’t know, **comment threads close after one week**. As occurred this week, if you want to continue a thread, the weekly “open thread” is the place to go. That option has the benefit of being less subject to my supervision!

2\) Speaking of which, probably every day or so I get a long, passionate, and coherent comment, which I never publish and which results in the banning of the commenter. I suspect most of these are newbies, who surf in via links, tweets, etc. But just in case you are tempted to go off on a rude rant, understand that you might as well just [email/Facebook message me](http://www.razib.com/). No one’s going to see what you say.

3\) I’ve scheduled open threads to go live once a week. Please use these. I regularly get off-topic questions/comments…but it’s not really feasible for me to track everything. The open thread is useful for odds & ends, and I do respond to a fair number of the queries.

4\) I occasionally publish material on other weblogs or sometimes even in regular webzines. If you want to know about that, you might want to subscribe to my [total feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed) (or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan)). Normally this wouldn’t be worth mentioning, but sometimes people are surprised when they run into me on another corner of the web.
