Sexual selection and economic growth

I’m not sure how much drive-by traffic gnxp is continuing to receive, but figured it worthwhile to post a note about [my latest working paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111740), which explores whether male signalling may have a role in driving economic progress. The abstract:

> **Sexual Selection, Conspicuous Consumption and Economic Growth** >
> The evolution by sexual selection of the male propensity to engage in > conspicuous consumption contributed to the emergence of modern rates > of economic growth. We develop a model in which males engage in > conspicuous consumption to send an honest signal of their quality to > females. Males who engage in conspicuous consumption have higher > reproductive success than those who do not, as females respond to the > costly and honest signal, increasing the prevalence of signalling > males in the population over time. As males fund conspicuous > consumption through participation in the labour force, the increase in > the prevalence of signalling males who engage in conspicuous > consumption gives rise to an increase in economic activity that leads > to economic growth.

I’ve posted some [background to the paper](http://www.jasoncollins.org/2012/08/sexual-selection-conspicuous-consumption-and-economic-growth/) over at Evolving Economics. I’ve also received some interesting feedback, including this [post on The Conversation](http://theconversation.edu.au/sexual-signalling-powers-the-economy-8780) by Rob Brooks.

Finally, I have posted on SSRN [an update to my paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1851251) examining the Galor-Moav model in which economic growth is triggered by the interplay between technological progress and an inherited preference for quality or quantity of children. I posted about it [on gnxp mid-last year](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/2011/06/06/natural-selection-and-the-collapse-of-economic-growth/ "Natural selection and the collapse of economic growth"). The revision carries the same story as the original paper, but is tighter and cuts out some of the flotsam.
