On ENCODE

There’s a reason that people say that the 21st century is the century of biology, whereas the 20th was the century of physics. See [Brendan Maher](http://www.nature.com/news/encode-the-human-encyclopaedia-1.11312), [Ed Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/09/05/encode-the-rough-guide-to-the-human-genome/), and [Dr. Daniel MacArthur’s](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/09/the-encode-project-lessons-for-scientific-publication.php) coverage. I haven’t read the papers, so I can’t say much, though ENCODE has been a big deal for a while.
