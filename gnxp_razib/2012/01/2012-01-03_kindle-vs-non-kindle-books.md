Kindle vs. non-kindle books

Out of curiosity, how many readers are switching mostly to Kindle books? I myself find myself doing this. Not for any ideological or conscious reason. Rather, cost and portability are both major upsides of the Kindle. I also find that “impulse buys” are easier for me on the Kindle (purchased [The Great Sea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00551S1HI/geneexpressio-20) and [Civilization: The West and the Rest](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0054TVW04/geneexpressio-20), the latter mostly to see if [Panjak Mishra](http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/12/05/niall-ferguson-vs-pankaj-mishra/) actually did read the book). The Kindle has been around for a few years, but it looks like web traffic related to it is still increasing radically. I compare it o the iPad below.

**Update:** OK, never mind about the comparison. I suspect that the bounce for “Kindle” is due to [Kindle Fire](https://www.google.com/trends?q=kindle+fire).
