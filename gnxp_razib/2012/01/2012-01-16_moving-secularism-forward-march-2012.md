Moving Secularism Forward, March 2012

Because of scheduling conflicts\* I can’t make [ScienceOnline2012](http://scienceonline2012.com/) (I had planned to make it). But I thought I would put in an announcement here that in a month and a half I’ll be at the [Moving Secularism Forward](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/events/moving_secularism_forward/) conference put on by the [Center for Inquiry](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/). I’m going to be on a political panel on Saturday afternoon, the 3rd of March. There are going to be representatives of the progressive, liberal, conservative, and libertarian, positions. I’ll be the conservative, and make a 20 minute presentation. There will be a Q & A. My time in the “spotlight” should be no more than a few hours.

My current plan is that I’ll be there Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning. It’s in Orlando, Florida. I have no idea as to the overlap between the audience for that sort of conference and the readership of this weblog, but I assume that there is some intersection. I don’t really do the reader meetup thing anymore, but if you see me feel free to say hello. I won’t give you a weird look. My only current “social” plans are to meet up with [Ron Bailey](http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey/all), who’s going to give the libertarian perspective on the panel, and whose work I’ve been a great admirer of for years.
