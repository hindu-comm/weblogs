Our symbionts are death!

Several readers have expressed skepticism of the high mortality numbers [Charles C. Mann](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/10-questions-for-charles-c-mann/) reports in his [two](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400032059/geneexpressio-20) [books](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307265722/geneexpressio-20) in relation to the [Columbian Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbian_Exchange). In case you are not aware, the thesis that Mann outlines is that the primary necessary condition whereby Europeans managed to eliminate indigenous populations from much of the New World was that they brought with them diseases which the native people did not have an immunity to. This model often argues that mortality rates were on the order of 90 percent. Such a scenario has broad plausibility because the situation in the New World has an inverse counterpoint: Africa. Before [quinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine) the European dominion on the continent was limited to outposts and fringes (e.g., the Cape region of South Africa, which was free of many of the diseases deadly to Europeans). Overall I find Mann’s argument qualitatively reasonable, even if one may qualify it on the margins quantitatively. But I stumbled upon more evidence recently: **it still holds for those Amerindians which have not been exposed to Eurasian diseases**. From a *National Geographic* story, [Into the Amazon](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/features/world/south-america/brazil/amazon-text):

Over thousands of years Eurasians, and to a large extent most inhabitants of the “World Island” (Eurasia + Africa), have become habituated to a range of endemic ailments which may make us miserable, but do not kill us. Our bodies are hosts to an order of magnitude more bacteria than our own tissue cells. Most are innocuous or beneficial, but some are potentially deadly. Many of us carry pathogens which do not result in any illness over our lifetimes. There are geneticists who argue that a small minority of people exhibit genetic susceptibilities to pathogens which are normally benign. **What if these people are the ancestral type?**

I think about this in particular when considering the case of the [Sentinel Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinelese_people). This tribe has been left alone by the Indian government, and remains out of contact with the rest of humanity. Some of this is a function that other Andaman Island tribes which have had extensive contact with people from the mainland have not done so well due to the combined effects of Indian disease and diet. **But is it right and proper that modern humans be isolated from the rest of the population for their own good?** What does the reality of a whole people who are viewed as [“Bubble Boys”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Boy) tell us about the range of the human condition?
