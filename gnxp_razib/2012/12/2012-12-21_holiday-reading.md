Holiday reading

Christmas is a time when I accelerate my reading, and catch-up for lost time. Here’s my three books I plan to get through:

[The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20). I’ve read this twice already. This short book has been one of the most influential works in my own personal thinking. Even if you don’t agree with the thrust of Bryan Ward-Perkins’ thesis, it will clarify your own position.

[Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115290X/geneexpressio-20). The author, Peter Brown, is the modern day eminence on [‘Late Antiquity’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity). I’ve read many of his earlier works, and always found his exposition enjoyable. But I’m re-reading [The Fall of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20) in part to have a good counterpoint in my head to Brown’s arguments, which are subtle and difficult to box in (for what it’s worth, I think Brown makes a bit too much of Late Antiquity, but to some extent this is a *normative* judgement).

[The Founders of Evolutionary Genetics: A Centenary Reappraisal](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792333926/geneexpressio-20). This is an exciting time to be interested in evolution and genetics (see [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) and prepare to be overwhelmed!). But I also think it is useful to have some historical perspective. Science is a *human* enterprise, and it is critical to step outside of the flowing river, and observe the parameters which shaped its past course and trajectory, and therefore where it may be going.

With that, an “open thread” for what you are reading, and why.

**Note:** The comments systems should be improved in the near future. Or so I’m told.
