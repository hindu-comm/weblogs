Thanks for the memories

I’m not big into music, being of the aesthetically retarded set, but as I age memory becomes more important, and that is strongly colored by music. The [80s anthems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) of the [Beastie Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys) were part of the cultural firmament for me, but at that stage I was more of a [Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie) kind of guy. In contrast, [So What’cha Want](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_What%27cha_Want) takes me back to the summer of ’92 in a very visceral way. I had come to an age where the Beastie Boys were no longer social white noise, but the rhythm of a life which seemed to roll out before me with possibilities (OK, let’s keep it real, at the time the possibilities were quite proximate and driven by hormonal rushes of puberty).
