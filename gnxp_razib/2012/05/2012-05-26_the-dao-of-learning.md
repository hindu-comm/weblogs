The Dao of Learning

[Accidental Blogger](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2012/05/curry-or-culture-all-ab-bloggers.html) points me to a rather funny event, the yearly victory of some brown kid in the *National Spelling Bee*. [‘I was nervous’: Texas whiz kid beats teens in 2012 National Geographic Bee](https://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/24/11862705-i-was-nervous-texas-whiz-kid-beats-teens-in-2012-national-geographic-bee). This Texas whiz kid, Rahul Nagvekar, beat a prodigy from Wisconsin, Vansh Jain. Here were the 10 finalists for the [GeoBee](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/2012-top-10-finalists/):

– Raghav Ranga, Arizona  
– Varun Mahadevan, California  
– Anthony Stoner, Louisiana  
– Adam Rusak, Maryland  
– Karthik Karnik, Massachusetts  
– Gopi Ramanathan, Minnesota  
– Neelam Sandhu, New Hampshire  
– Rahul Nagvekar, Texas  
– Anthony Cheng, Utah  
– Vansh Jain, Wisconsin

Speaking of bees, the [National Spelling Bee](http://www.spellingbee.com/about-bee-week) is coming up. Here are the [contestants](http://www.spellingbee.com/statistics) (page down). And here’s a list of the [2012 Intel Science Contest](http://apps.societyforscience.org/sts/71sts/finalists.asp) finalists. And winners of the [American Mathematics Competition](http://amc.maa.org/usamo/2012/2012_USAJMO_Top14&HonMent.pdf).

I think it’s great that kids from certain demographics do so well at these academic competitions. But I have to be honest and wonder if sometimes we aren’t seeing individuals who are so focused on the measure, **that they forget what we’re trying to measure.** God knows I think metrics are very important, but the pursuit of knowledge ultimately has nothing to do with a panel of judges or selection of correct answers. South Korea already exists, it’s a fine enough country, we don’t need to replicate it.
