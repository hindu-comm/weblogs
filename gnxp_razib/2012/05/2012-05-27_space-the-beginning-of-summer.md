Space & the beginning of summer

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/260px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg?resize=260%2C260)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/260px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg?resize=260%2C260)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/260px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg)It’s been a big few weeks for space, with the success of [Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(spacecraft)). I don’t have anything to add in a descriptive or analytic sense, I know as much (or likely less) as you on this issue (this is why should read [Bad Astronomy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/)). Needless to say I’ve been rooting for [Elon Musk’s](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/05/20/elon-musk-shoots-for-the-stars-with-spacex.html) enterprise, so to speak. I’m not old enough to remember the “space race,” which put a man on the moon. Rather, for my generation space and NASA had become rather pedestrian, with the shuttle being a sky ferry *par excellence*. Space is important not because of what it will do for us in concrete terms (e.g., Tang), but what will do for us on a deeper level. Otherwise we may fall prey to the sort of *ennui* one reads about in science fiction universes such as the city of [Diaspar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Stars#Setting). Remember, we’re the species which made it to the New World and Oceania. This sort of crazy and irrational endeavor is part of who we are.

On a different note, hope people are enjoying the de facto start of the summer (Memorial Day weekend in the USA).
