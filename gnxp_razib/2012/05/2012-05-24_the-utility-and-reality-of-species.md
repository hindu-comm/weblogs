The utility and reality of species

Of all the [taxonomic ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) species is the most clear, distinct, and concrete. More practically, it is the level which most naturally falls out of the patterns of life’s tree. Or does it? If the term “species concept” does not ring a bell, please [see this entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species#Difficulty_of_defining_.22species.22_and_identifying_particular_species). If it does, how do you define species in a non-arbitrary manner?
