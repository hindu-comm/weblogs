Honey Boo Boo, Jersey Shore, and the Sistine Chapel

Scott Jackisch (a.k.a., “Oakland Futurist Guy”) has a post up with the title, [Jersey Shore is better than cat burning](http://sjackisch.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/jersey-shore-is-better-than-cat-burning/). Provocative? Yes. Timely? No. Jersey Shore is *so* 2010. We live in the age of Honey Boo Boo. This is clear from [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Jersey%20Shore%2C%20Honey%20Boo%20Boo&geo=US&date=today%2012-m&cmpt=q). **The red line represents searches for Honey Boo Boo, and the blue for Jersey Shore**.

Mama June farting up a storm is still superior to cat burning. But about the Sistine Chapel, I’ll leave you with [Mr. Jackisch’s ruminations](http://sjackisch.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/jersey-shore-is-better-than-cat-burning/) on that and genital mutilation:

The question of modularity and contingency in cultural production is one that we don’t often consider. I suspect it’s because we don’t want to.
