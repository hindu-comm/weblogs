Prop 37 vs. Obama (by county)

Following up my request [a reader crunched the numbers](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/11/san-francisco-supported-proposition-37/#comments) (here is his [data table](https://gist.github.com/4122837)) to show the association between supporting [supporting Proposition 37](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_37,_Mandatory_Labeling_of_Genetically_Engineered_Food_(2012)) and voting for Barack Obama by county in California:

From what I know this issue *really* polarized people in highly educated liberal enclaves in the state of California. Many of my Left non-scientist friends supported the measure because of an anti-corporate animus. But, another issue that sometimes came up was transparency and fair play, in a “teach the controversy” fashion. My own contention is on the scientific point **there is no controversy.**
