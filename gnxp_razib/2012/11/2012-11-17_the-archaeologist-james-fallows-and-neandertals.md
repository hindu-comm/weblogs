The archaeologist, James Fallows, and Neandertals

A month ago I posted [Don’t trust an archaeologist about genetics, don’t trust a geneticist about archaeology](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/10/dont-trust-an-archaeologist-about-genetics-dont-trust-a-geneticist-about-archaeology/), in response to James Fallows at [At 5% Neanderthal, You Are an Outlier](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/at-5-neanderthal-you-are-an-outlier/263475/). Fallows has now put up a follow up, [The Neanderthal Defense Committee Swings Into Action](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/the-neanderthal-defense-committee-swings-into-action/265260/), where he links to my response post. This prompted the original archaeologist in question to reach out to me via email. I am posting the letter, with their permission, below.

As I told my correspondent **I agree with much of the sentiment above.** Rather, the problem in the general sense is that James Fallows should have been cautious about taking the expertise of a non-geneticist for granted when it came to genetics. Second, on the specific issue of contamination, I think [Nick Patterson’s comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/10/dont-trust-an-archaeologist-about-genetics-dont-trust-a-geneticist-about-archaeology/#comment-166949) is the sort whose thrust should convince non-specialists:

Additionally, remember that **Denisovans and Neandertals seem to form a distinct clade in relation to modern humans.** I have difficultly understanding how modern contamination would result in this pattern.
