Adam's end was never in the cards

There has been a lot of talk in [the media](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17127617) about a [new paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature10843.html) which reports that the Y chromosome is not deteriorating, as had been previously inferred from the data. In the 2004 Bryan Sykes wrote [Adam’s Curse: A Future Without Men](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393058964/geneexpressio-20)which used this model as a framing device (and naturally elicited great general interest). You can read some [earlier](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000613.html) [critiques](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001114.html) at [Gene Expression Classic](https://www.gnxp.com/). I never paid attention to this debate in the details because it seemed ludicrous on the face of it. Bryan Sykes’ was predicting the extinction of males in \~100,000 years. Right, we just happen to be living right before the genomic Götterdämmerung. I don’t think so. Sometimes absurd results which fly in the face of plain history and robust theory are profoundly insightful. But most of the time they’re just false leads.
