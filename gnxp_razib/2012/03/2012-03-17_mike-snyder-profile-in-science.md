Mike Snyder profile in Science

[Examining His Own Body, Stanford Geneticist Stops Diabetes in Its Tracks](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/03/examining-his-own-body-stanford-.html):

> Over a 14-month period, the molecular geneticist at Stanford > University in Palo Alto, California, analyzed his blood 20 different > times to pluck out a wide variety of biochemical data depicting the > status of his body’s immune system, metabolism, and gene activity. In > today’s issue of*Cell*, Snyder and a team of 40 other researchers > present the results of this[extraordinarily detailed look at his > body](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900166-3?utm_source=ECE001&utm_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_medium=email&bid=P5SP63F:5PCQ4), > which they call an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP) because > it combines cutting-edge scientific fields such as genomics (study of > one’s DNA), metabolomics (study of metabolism), and proteomics (study > of proteins). Instead of seeing a snapshot of the body taken during > the typical visit to a doctor’s office, iPOP effectively offers an > IMAX movie, which in Snyder’s case had the added drama of charting his > response to two viral infections and the emergence of type 2 diabetes.

Hopefully in about 10 years this will be the norm, not cutting edge science.
