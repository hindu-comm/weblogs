How Game of Thrones Should Have Ended

I haven’t watched most of the films (or video games, or T.V. shows) being parodied by [How It Should Have Ended](http://www.howitshouldhaveended.com/). But I have read [A Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553386794/geneexpressio-20). So I’m confused as to why this struck me as rather unfunny, in comparison to most of the others where I have to educate myself on what’s being parodied….
