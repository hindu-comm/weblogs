No comments please, we've made it through peer review (?)

Recently [Daniel MacArthur](https://twitter.com/#!/dgmacarthur/status/183840282280853504) pointed to the [vibrant discussion](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/03/questioning-the-evidence-for-non-canonical-rna-editing-in-humans.php) over at [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) on a moderately infamous paper from *Science* last year, [Widespread RNA and DNA Sequence Differences in the Human Transcriptome](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/53), asserting that it is “exactly what open peer review should be like.” This made me wonder, it’s been [over five years](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2007/02/to-post-or-not-to-post/) since Chris Surridge asked why there was so much more commentary on a *PLoS ONE paper*, [By Hook or by Crook? Morphometry, Competition and Cooperation in Rodent Sperm](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000170), on [blogs](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/spermcooperation.php) than on the paper itself. Has anything changed? The most viewed paper on *PLoS Biology,*[How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001127), has 9 comments for 45,000 article views. In contrast, [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/03/questioning-the-evidence-for-non-canonical-rna-editing-in-humans.php) has 14 comments for likely far fewer page views. Additionally, **if you find the post on the weblog the comments automatically load.** Not so with the *PLoS Biology* paper, you have to click through (yes, I see how this can be a feature, not a bug, but in that case why even bother with comments if you provide an email address for correspondence?)

  
I’m not going to rehash Joseph Pickrell’s [argument](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) in [Why publish science in peer-reviewed journals?](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) Rather, I want to reiterate that the ultimate goal here **is to figure out how the world works.** To understand that you need to get a sense of the science, and if you aren’t a specialist simply consulting peer reviewed literature is not always sufficient or practicable. Recently a researcher was discussing the *Science* paper at issue above to some graduate students, reiterating Joseph Pickrell’s points. When someone was curious about further details **the individual explaining the controversy specifically cited Pickrell’s [earlier post](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/05/notes-on-the-evidence-for-extensive-rna-editing-in-humans.php) on the topic in *Genomes Unzipped* to get an understanding of the broader issues of the critique.** From what I know this person is not a major reader of science blogs. Rather, Pickrell’s post likely came up high on a search engine query, and to his mind was an appropriate reflection of the scientific consensus as he understood it. The question is **why does the discussion not begin in the journals themselves?** Why do curious people have to scour the internet? When a controversy or “big paper” emerges in a specific area outside of my detailed focus I know what I do: I simply load the appropriate science blogs which cover that topic. There I hope to get a sense of what the people in the field think. **Peer review is *not sufficient* in many cases.** Science is a production of humans, and so is fraught with politics, and reputations are thrown about to get a paper in “high impact” journals.

But is anything broken in the first place? Is this how it’s supposed to work, and how it’s going to work? Journals make a huge argument for their value. They charge academic libraries quite a mint (**with honorable exceptions made for open access journals!**). It seems that they should make at least a good faith effort at post-publication review and extension. Did you know that *Nature* has a comments feature? Have you *ever* seen a comment posted via this feature?
