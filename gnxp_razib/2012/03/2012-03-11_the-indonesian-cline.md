The Indonesian cline

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/wallace.jpg?resize=587%2C209)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/wallace.jpg?resize=587%2C209)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/wallace.jpg)

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2012/03/austronesian-spread-across-indonesia.html) has touched upon it in detail, so I don’t have much to add. Except for two points:

1\) The ancestry cline here is not due to isolation-by-distance, but the expansion of the Austronesian population rather precipitously \~4,000 years ago. As Dienekes observed this was rather clear by non-genetic means; this is just icing on the cake.

2\) There is evidence of an [Austro-Asiatic substrate](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/07/to-the-antipode-of-asia/) across maritime Southeast Asia. For whatever reason it seems that Austro-Asiatic speaking agriculturalists ceased their push east at the Wallace Line.
