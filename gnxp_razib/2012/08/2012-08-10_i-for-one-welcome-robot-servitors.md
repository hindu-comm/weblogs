I, for one, welcome robot servitors!

This is an incredible story, [Meet ROBOT-Rx, The Robot Pharmacist Doling Out 350 Million Doses Per Year](http://singularityhub.com/2012/06/03/meet-robot-rx-the-robot-pharmacist-doling-out-350-million-doses-per-year/):

It’s happening, and not just with ROBOT-Rx. **Both the > University of California, San Francisco’s Automated Pharmacy and the > PillPick system at New Jersey’s Holy Name Hospital work ’round the > clock filling thousands of doses each day.** >

At > least for the pharmacist, this seems to be true.

From what I have read the [UCSF pharmacy](http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2011/03/9510/new-ucsf-robotic-pharmacy-aims-improve-patient-safety) has been an incredible success in terms of reducing errors.
