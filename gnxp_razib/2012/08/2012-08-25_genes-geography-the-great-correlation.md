Genes & geography – the great correlation

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/journal.pgen_.1002886.g004.png?resize=600%2C403)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/journal.pgen_.1002886.g004.png?resize=600%2C403)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/journal.pgen_.1002886.g004.png)

A paper is out in *PLoS Genetics* which attempts to formalize the relationship between genes and geography, [A Quantitative Comparison of the Similarity between Genes and Geography in Worldwide Human Populations](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002886?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002886.g004). They found a reasonable correlation, but there are two issues. First, African hunter-gatherers tend to reduce the correlation. This makes sense. If you think of African genetic variation to a great extent being shaped by the wave front of Bantu expansion, then isolation by distance works well enough. But the Pygmies, Hadza, etc., are isolated shoals which disrupt the smoothness of the sea of Bantu genetic variation. Second, they found a really good correlation in Asia. But one should be cautious about this:
