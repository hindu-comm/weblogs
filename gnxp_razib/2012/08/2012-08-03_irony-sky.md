What big money for physicists means

[9 Scientists Receive a New Physics Prize](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/science/9-scientists-win-yuri-milners-fundamental-physics-prize.html?pagewanted=print):

I doubt anyone will go into physics to get this prize. Rather, the importance here is **what this teaches society in terms of what is valuable and worthy of praise in our culture.** It is a question of values, not incentives and utils. The difference between Athens in the 5th century BC and Constantinople in the 6th century AD is not a matter of material conditions. The empire which Constantinople could mobilize dwarfed the Delian League headed by Athens. But the Athenians had different values than the early Byzantines. Aside from Justinian and Theodora, arguably the most famous individual from this period in Constantinople is the general, Belisarius. In contrast, Alcibiades ranks somewhat lower in the high society of Athens.
