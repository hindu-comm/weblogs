A survey on genes, behavior, etc.

First, a minor note. People have repeatedly mentioned my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:gnxp) in the comments. This surprised me, as the kind of things I bookmark for later are very diverse and…interesting I suppose. Out of curiosity I checked to see how many people had used Google Reader to subscribe, and it was 27! Anyway, if you want to see what I’m bookmarking every day, then here’s the [RSS](http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:gnxp/)(and if you like that, subscribe to [Jason Malloy’s Delicious feed](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/jasonmalloy?count=20)).

Second, **I want some reader feedback on a survey design**. I normally ask questions on reader surveys about attitudes toward things like sex differences. I want to do something similar, but in more in-depth. I’d also like to ask readers about genetically modified organisms and other such things. The reason I’m putting this post up is that I always get complaints about the wording of questions no matter how precise I try to be. So enter in questions, and demographic variables, that you think might be interesting. I’m not a patient person, so I’ll probably put up the survey next week.
