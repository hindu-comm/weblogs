An exegesis of Robert Pollack?

I was going to review [North African Jewish and non-Jewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/31/1204840109.abstract) at some point soon, but I’m going to have to move that up. [Someone on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ArikSharon) pointed me to this really weird [article](https://forward.com/articles/160919/being-jewish-is-more-mind-than-matter/?utm_campaign=&utm_content=general-general&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=jd.fo-other), [Being Jewish Is More Mind Than Matter: It’s Not Just Genes That Makes Us a People or Nation](https://forward.com/articles/160919/being-jewish-is-more-mind-than-matter/?utm_campaign=&utm_content=general-general&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=jd.fo-other), by one [Robert Pollack](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/faculty-data/robert-pollack/faculty.html). Let me be frank: **I have a hard time even commenting on material which I can’t really understand.** For example:

> Ancestors are a very large population: Each of us can be sure we had > more than 1,000 ancestors in only the last 10 generations, or a few > centuries. And genetically speaking, a lot can happen over the > generations. After all, each of us inherits only one of the two > versions of DNA that each parent had previously inherited from his or > her parents. A particular version of DNA information may be discarded > and lost at any point in time; new DNA may be introduced; or an > ancient line of genetic information may be conserved — carried and > passed on from generation to generation even as it accumulates > different genetic changes that are also passed down.

This stuff is just hard to decrypt. Really it sounds like a high school science paper in portions, but since the author is a professor at Columbia you have to give him more credit than that, and assume he has a deeper meaning, right? Or maybe not.
