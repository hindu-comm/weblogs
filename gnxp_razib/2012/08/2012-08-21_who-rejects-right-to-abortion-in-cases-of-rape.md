Who rejects right to abortion in cases of rape?

It’s basically impossible to avoid hearing about [Todd Akin](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/us/politics/todd-akin-controversy-may-hurt-republican-chances.html?pagewanted=all) right now. My Twitter and Facebook feeds are kind of swamped. But it did make me wonder: what percentage of Americans reject abortion in cases of rape and incest? The GSS has a handy variable, ABRAPE, which asks respondents about the possibility of abortion if a woman gets pregnant as a result of rape (let’s stipulate that it’s possible to get pregnant as a result of rape!). **I also limited the sample to the year 2000 and later, and non-Hispanic whites** (to clear out confounds).
