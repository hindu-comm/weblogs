The sea as it was

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/06/The-Great-Sea-A-Human-Histor.jpg?resize=140%2C215)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/06/The-Great-Sea-A-Human-Histor.jpg?resize=140%2C215)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195323343/geneexpressio-20)I haven’t mentioned that a few months ago I read an incredible book, [The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195323343/geneexpressio-20). It weighs in at \~650 pages of dense narrative text, and you’ll want to jump to the footnotes as well! There isn’t much I can say in this space that would do justice to the book, the author has produced a tour de force of macrohistory. As someone with more scholarly tastes in history and culture I have noticed a definite bias toward monographs on my part. Too often generalist tomes are superficial surveys; no author can command all of the literature, and Wikipedia has truly replaced many of the entry-level works. [The Great Sea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195323343/geneexpressio-20) has some of the typical problems with broad sweeping histories, but they’re usually evident only in closer inspection of footnotes (there seems a particular weakness in prehistory and far antiquity).

But ultimately this is definitely a book that’s worth it because it shows you exactly how one can generate an intellectual scaffold. Too often people know densely but narrowly, and more often thinly but superficially. Both of these modes lack heft and the ability to cut thickly through reality. It takes a genuinely dense and interlaced work such as [The Great Sea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195323343/geneexpressio-20) to give you a good model for the true shape of reality.
