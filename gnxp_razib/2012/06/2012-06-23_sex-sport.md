Sex & sport

*The New York Times* has an article up on a [new I.O.C. ruling](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/sports/olympics/ioc-adopts-policy-for-deciding-whether-athletes-can-compete-as-women.html?hp&pagewanted=print) on who can compete as a woman. Basically they look at testosterone levels. This seems a different tack than cases where women were banned from competing as women [because they had a male karytoptype](https://zagria.blogspot.com/2009/08/maria-jose-martinez-patino-1961-athlete.html) ([AIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome)). This article came on my radar because I had already read this op-ed from about a week ago, [You Say You’re a Woman? That Should Be Enough](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/sports/olympics/olympic-sex-verification-you-say-youre-a-woman-that-should-be-enough.html). This sentence jumped out at me:

> Second, when it comes to sex, sports authorities should acknowledge > that while science can offer evidence, it cannot dictate what evidence > we should use. **Scientifically, there is no clear or objective way to > draw a bright line between male and female.**

What do people think of this assertion? I’m aware of [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) individuals. But if we start to assert that [dioecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioecy) is just a “social construct” then let’s revisit [species concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species). I’m sure there are some farmers and loggers who might assert that one can’t draw objective bright lines between populations. Distinctions between male and female in most species is much more clear and distinct than various taxonomic categories.
