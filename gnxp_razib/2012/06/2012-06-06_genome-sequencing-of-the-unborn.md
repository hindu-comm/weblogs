Genome sequencing of the unborn

[Noninvasive Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Human Fetus](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/137/137ra76):

> Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma holds promise for > the development of noninvasive prenatal genetic diagnostics. Previous > studies have been restricted to detection of fetal trisomies, to > specific paternally inherited mutations, or to genotyping common > polymorphisms using material obtained invasively, for example, through > chorionic villus sampling. Here, we combine genome sequencing of two > parents, genome-wide maternal haplotyping, and deep sequencing of > maternal plasma DNA to noninvasively determine the genome sequence of > a human fetus at 18.5 weeks of gestation. Inheritance was predicted at > 2.8 × 10⁶ parental heterozygous sites with 98.1% accuracy. > Furthermore, 39 of 44 de novo point mutations in the fetal genome were > detected, albeit with limited specificity. Subsampling these data and > analyzing a second family trio by the same approach indicate that > parental haplotype blocks of \~300 kilo–base pairs combined with > shallow sequencing of maternal plasma DNA is sufficient to > substantially determine the inherited complement of a fetal genome. > However, ultradeep sequencing of maternal plasma DNA is necessary for > the practical detection of fetal de novo mutations genome-wide. > Although technical and analytical challenges remain, we anticipate > that noninvasive analysis of inherited variation and de novo mutations > in fetal genomes will facilitate prenatal diagnosis of both recessive > and dominant Mendelian disorders.

Here’s the last paragraph:

> The ability to noninvasively sequence a fetal genome to high accuracy > and completeness will undoubtedly have profound implications for the > future of prenatal genetic diagnostics. Although individually rare, > when considered collectively, the \~3500 Mendelian disorders with a > known molecular basis (19) contribute substantially to morbidity and > mortality (20). Currently, routine obstetric practice includes > offering a spectrum of screening and diagnostic options to all women. > Prenatal screening options have imperfect sensitivity and focus mainly > on a small number of specific disorders, including trisomies, major > congenital anomalies, and specific Mendelian disorders. Diagnostic > tests, generally performed through invasive procedures, such as > chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, also focus on specific > disorders and confer risk of pregnancy loss that may inversely > correlate with access to high-quality care. Noninvasive, comprehensive > diagnosis of Mendelian disorders early in pregnancy would provide much > more information to expectant parents, with the greater accessibility > inherent to a noninvasive test and without tangible risk of pregnancy > loss. The less tangible implication of incorporating this level of > information into prenatal decision-making raises many ethical > questions that must be considered carefully within the scientific > community and on a societal level. A final point is that as in other > areas of clinical genetics, our capacity to generate data is > outstripping our ability to interpret it in ways that are useful to > physicians and patients. That is, although the noninvasive prediction > of a fetal genome may be technically feasible, its interpretation—even > for known Mendelian disorders—will remain a major challenge.
