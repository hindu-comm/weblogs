Redefining "impact factor"

In rereading the paper on [Pygmy height genetics](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002641), I noticed that *PLoS* had rolled out some nice [new metrics](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/metrics/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002641). To my shock this paper, which I think is a moderately big deal, had less than 1,000 views, and only \~150 PDF downloands! This is going to change, but it still shocks me. With all due respect to my statistical geneticist friends, but this isnâ€™t an abstruse methods paper debuting a new technique!

I decided to check on an older paper which has been rather influential, [A Map of Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/metrics/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040072), from 2006. Here are the metrics:

Bad? What do you think? Did you expect more downloads in the past 6 years?
