Ancestry painting: true but trivial, or interesting but inaccurate

[23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) has done some great things, and I highly recommend its service to friends. But I’m really glad that [CeCe Moore](http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/) is being consulted by them in regards to improving their ancestry feature set. Below are the “ancestry paintings” for myself & my daughter.

According to 23andMe I’m 40% Asian, and she is 8% Asian. Obviously something is off here. The situation easily resolved itself when I tuned my parameters and increased my sampled populations in [Interpretome](http://esquilax.stanford.edu/). But it just goes to show you the limits of this sort of thing without fine-grained control of the details of the analysis.
