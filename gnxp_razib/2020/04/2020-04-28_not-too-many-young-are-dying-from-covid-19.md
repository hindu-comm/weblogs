Not too many young are dying from COVID-19

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid19infl.jpg?resize=625%2C437&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid19infl.jpg?resize=625%2C437&ssl=1)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm)

When does COVID-19 get more dangerous than the flu? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm) has some deaths listed for COVID-19. It also has deaths recorded for influenza. **These are not perfect records**, but, they give us a general comparative sense.

The total count in their data for the column I’ve plotting is about half of or so of the current death total for the USA. With that said, COVID-19 seems to be a really marginal disease in terms of **mortality** for those 24 years and under. For those 85 years or old COVID-19 is killing order of magnitude more than the flu.

Of course, there is **morbidity** as well as mortality. COVID-19 seems to have a longer course of progression for the symptomatic, and, there is the worry that it may cause lifetime problems in many people who survive from the severe cases (and even possibly the asymptomatic).

But, the number of people who are under the age of 40 who are dying doesn’t seem that high. And yet when I see headlines and profiles in the media, a huge number of feature focuses seem to be about younger people who die of COVID-19. Why? Obviously, because the deaths of the younger are surprising. But, I also think that part of it is the same rationale for the HIV-AIDS campaign: by pretending as if everyone is vulnerable, you obtain mass social mobilization.

I happen to know lots of people will not look at the raw data to understand what’s happening. But enough will to get annoyed.

50% of the deaths in Europe are in care homes. My family is self-quarantining no because we feel at risk, we’re not. But because there are older people in our family from whom we don’t want to be exiled. Does the media think if we admit and highlight the enormous danger that older people in particular face, we’ll conclude that they’re disposable?
