Homo antecessor is not the ancestor!

A new paper in *Nature*, [The dental proteome of *Homo antecessor*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2153-8):

This is an 800,000 year old sample from Spain. Proteins are more robust than DNA, so they last longer, but they tend to give less information. But at the scale of species-wide differences there is enough variation to establish some tentative relationships.

Previously some researchers argued *H. antecessor* was ancestral to modern humans. This seems to suggest this is unlikely. Or at least that *antecessor* is not the dominant direct ancestor.
