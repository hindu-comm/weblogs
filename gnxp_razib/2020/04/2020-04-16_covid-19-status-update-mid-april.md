COVID-19 status update, mid-April

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thecomingplague.jpeg?resize=215%2C215&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thecomingplague.jpeg?resize=215%2C215&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FGR6RO//geneexpressio-20)Spencer and I recorded another coronavirus episode of [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/). It should be live in a day or so. Therefore, I thought it was good to take stock and make some comments (my Twitter autodeletes).

– A few weeks ago I had been optimistic and suggested that the USA would have 40,000 deaths. [That seems unlikely](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). I will remain optimistic and suggest 85,000 deaths by August 31st.

– I think most of the country will “open up” between May 15th and June 15th.

– Heterogeneity in trajectory persists. Some of this is through clear policy (e.g., Taiwan). But some of it is through demographics (USA is 40% obese, Japan is 3% obese). And, some of it is probably genetics.

– Many commentators make the correct observation that “no evidence of X” is not good evidence. E.g., “we have no evidence of human-to-human transmission…”

– The term “conspiracy theory” is totally debased. Just like the word racist or squish.

– High levels of uncertainty on everything. For example, many preprints which find confusing associations between weather and COVID-19 somehow transform in the media to titles of the form “COVID-19 won’t disappear in the summer!”
