The brotherhoods of the plains

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/comancheempire.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/comancheempire.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MA1S86M//geneexpressio-20)One of my favorite concepts is “evoked culture.” This is basically pointing to the fact that some human cultural forms and practices aren’t contingent and arbitrary, but naturally emerge due to the canalization imposed by our cognitive biases and the physical and social world around us. An example Spencer Wells likes to use to illustrate this is that indigenous hunters on the Andaman Islanders immediately took to dogs as helpmates when they were introduced to them. The coadaptation between domestic dogs and humans is clearly intense and natural.

Horses are another example. The Plains Indians of the New World became some of the most fearsome mounted warriors in history after the Spaniards introduced domestic horses. By the 18th century some tribes, such as the [Comanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians#The_horse), were fully mounted and mobile. This occurred over 200 years.

The last great chief of the Comanche, Quanah Parker, was the son of a white Texan woman.

I think of the Comanche when I wonder what the early steppe peoples were like. The Scythians, Sarmatians, the Sintashtas and Turks. The impact of the horse on their lifestyles, and the centrality of the horse, still echoes down to the present. The Central Asian Turks still drink [mare’s milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis#Consumption). Indian grooms still ride on a white mare at their wedding.

But one of the major themes in pastoralist communities seems to be patrilineality and integration of local women. This seems to be illustrated in a new paper, [Corded Ware cultural complexity uncovered using genomic and isotopic analysis from south-eastern Poland](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63138-w):

This seems a consistent pattern: **“steppe” ancestry seems to be mediated through male migrations.** There are likely differences between agro-pastoralists (like the early Germans who moved into the Roman Empire), and full-blown nomads like the Huns, Turks, and Mongols. But overall the trend seems to be the rise of a particular patriarchal culture with the horse people, along with the spread of gods of the sky and lacking attachment to a particular place.
