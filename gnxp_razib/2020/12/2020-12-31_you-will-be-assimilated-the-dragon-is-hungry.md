You will be assimilated: the dragon is hungry

In *WSJ*, [Beijing Accelerates Campaign of Ethnic Assimilation: China has taken an aggressive approach to melding the nation’s many groups into a national identity](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-accelerates-campaign-of-ethnic-assimilation-11609431781?mod=hp_lead_pos11).

Because the audience is American the author quotes scholars talking about colonialism and the model of the American “melting pot.” Obviously, China’s actions \`have been to be understood in an **early modern and ancient context**.

But, the original border to the north was only established in 1689 with the [Treaty of Nerchinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nerchinsk) between the **Manchus** and Russia. In other words, much of China today as a political-territorial entity has relatively shallow historical roots and derives from the Manchu Empire, which itself is often depicted as alien by Chinese nationalists. The Chinese nation-state has reappropriated the Manchu patrimony and erased its origins in cultural memory.

To me, it is clear that the difficulties of integration and assimilation having to do with several of the peoples mentioned in the *WSJ* piece is due to the fact that the Peoples’ Republic of China **inherited the multiethnic Manchu Empire.** The Manchu relationship with the Tibetans and Mongols was close, with the Mongols often serving as imperial auxiliaries (there was a tradition of intermarriage between the descendants of Genghis Khan’s younger brother, Khasr, and the Manchu elite lineages), and the Tibetans providing the Manchus ideological legitimacy in the same manner that they did earlier to various Mongol groups. These relationships are outside of, and parallel, to early modern Chinese history, by which I refer to the Imperial Chinese tradition which Manchu rulers such as Kangxi Emperor so perfectly exemplified ***within* China proper.**

One has to bracket the relationships between the Han Chinese with peripheral groups that have some level of ethno-territorial integrity (e.g., Tibetans, Uighurs, Mongols), and those minorities which have been resident with China proper (e.g., the Hui and the Zhuang). The Chinese have never had a history of assimilating Tibetans and Uighurs on the frontiers because these territories are relatively new acquisitions (Han and Tang dynasty control of parts of Xinjiang were always very tenuous and short-lived). The Tibetan autonomous zone was under Chinese rule only when China was ruled by foreign dynasties with pro-Tibetan cultural policies, the Mongol Yuan and the Manchus.

In contrast, **China has a long history of assimilating minorities to various extents within Han dominated territory.** Han Chinese north of the Yangzi clearly have West Eurasian ancestry. My own belief is that this is mostly assimilation of pastoralists, whether Turkic or Mongol, as these groups both exhibit West Eurasian ancestry (the Tang dynasty had partial Xianbei origins).

Rodney Stark in [One True God: Historical Consequences of Monotheism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07DMVPV9Z/geneexpressio-20) reports an empirical instance of assimilation in China proper. **The wives of the last prominent Jews of Kaifeng in the 18th century were raising pigs in their front yards.** It was a clear instance of assimilation into Han culture. Stark argues that the integration of Jewish elites into the Chinese bureaucracy bled away leaders who might have allowed the community to maintain its integrity.

Though most of the Kaifeng Jews (who were [probably descended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaifeng_Jews#History) from Persian Jews) became Han, some of them became Hui. That is, Muslims who speak the local Han dialect and besides religion are not so different from the Han. Why did the Hui persist while the Jews did not? The key here is clearly numbers, as the Hui were never as isolated from other Muslims, and there were always enough of them that many cities had zones allocated to their habitation. But even the Hui were subject to assimilative pressures, and many Han today have Hui ancestry. Because of the Chinese fixation on paternal lineage, there are clans who know that their direct paternal ancestor was a Persian Muslim, even though in all ways the clan members are Han Chinese.

As a stylized fact, the traditional Confucian understanding of being civilized was predicated on cultural orientations and rituals, not descent. This means that the path toward assimilation was relatively easy for those amenable to participating in the proper rites and speaking the Chinese language. If you read the *WSJ* piece it is hard not to come away with the idea that the aim of the PRC is simply to integrate ethnic minorities into being Han through the Chinese language, abandonment of excessive ties to exclusive religion, and intermarriage.

For obvious reasons, the piece focuses on the assimilation of ethnic and religious minorities. **But the PRC has also been engaging in a major drive to make it so that all citizens of the PRC, including dialect-speaking Han, are fluent in [Standard Mandarin](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1164941.shtml).** Today the figure is around 80%. Within a generation, it is likely to be well above 90%. This is not surprising or exceptional. All Germans can now speak Standard German, but there was a time when many spoke only regional dialects.

This was probably an underestimate. Nearly all of the “Manchu” (0.75%) were culturally Han and identified as Manchu to obtain benefits that accrue to ethnic minorities. Peter Brown in [The Rise of Western Christendom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118301269/geneexpressio-20) argues that it was after the switch to Arabic that Islamicization occurred at a much faster pace in the Fertile Crescent. When Uighur and Mongol parents protest that their children are learning Mandarin Chinese as their first language, their fears are well-founded.

**My overall comment here is that China has to be understood on its own terms.** The imposition of external categories and interpretative frameworks can illuminate some elements, but quite often it obscures and muddies. The leadership of China may justify its policies on modern grouds (e.g., “we are developing them economically…”), but it is hard for me not to see echoes of previous civilizing drives, whereby ethnic minorities became Chinese (part of this entailed edicts which imposed outmarriage!).
