Week 4-7, Gene Expression book club, Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom

Catching up on [![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/autumnheavenly.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/autumnheavenly.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20)[Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20) (I have to get to [chapter 11](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/event/gene-expression-book-club-autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-not-born-yesterday/) in the next few days). To say that this is a hard book to follow on occasion is understating difficulties. The narrative jumps across years, across China, and between protagonists, extensively. There are obviously three factions. The Taiping. The Qing regime. And foreigners. But the last class is heterogeneous in nationality and interests. While the Taiping and Qing obviously oppose each other, there are cases where the Europeans fight both the Taiping and Qing and other cases where Europeans lean toward supporting the regimes of the Taiping and Qing. Additionally, in the case of the French and British forces, many of the “Europeans” are non-white colonials. Algerian Arabs and Indian Sikhs, to name two instances.

Geographically the core of the action is still in the lower Yangzi valley. The Taiping, whose origins are in the South are now firmly established for years as a dominant regime. Internal faction and infighting hobble their effectiveness, and Hong Rengan, the cousin of the Taiping king, is the de facto leader. Local levies in Hunan around the loyalist official [Zeng Guoquan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guoquan) are described as the real factor in stopping the Taiping advance. The sections about Zeng are interesting to me because he illustrates the banality and normalcy of Chinese scholar officialdom for thousands of years. Knowing about the Taiping Rebellion only superficially I have long wondered how the Qing managed to not be overthrown. And Europeans and Americans of the time also took it for granted quite often than the Qing would be toppled.

[Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20) so far depicts the Qing, and the Manchu and Mongol core of the ruling caste, as ineffectual and incompetent. Rather, Taiping infighting, European ambivalence, and perhaps more importantly the inertia and robustness of the Chinese imperial system maintain a metastable equilibrium of three parties engaging in battles with each other. Zeng in particular seems like a force of nature, somewhat independent of his notional fealty to the Qing. The Chinese elite accepts Qing rule, but by this point, they ran much of the show.

I was not aware before this book that the Europeans engaged in joint expeditions against the Qing during the Taiping Rebellion, but this is described in detail in these chapters. Additionally, the French in particular come off as rather brutal and fixated on looting. The religious difference between the Catholic French and Protestant British and Americans also seems to color their views of the Taiping, as the latter was influenced by Protestant iconoclasm. Overall, many of the more enthusiastic Europeans and Americans remind me somewhat of pro-Iraq pundits in the early 2000’s. They thought that the Taiping victory would produce general realignment, and bring China into the Anglo-Protestant orbit.

The only “good guy” that I see so far is Zeng. His militia seems to be fighting for the people. For Hunan. In contrast, the Taiping as a whole have lost the plot, while most of the Europeans and Qing elites are focused on their own power and status.
