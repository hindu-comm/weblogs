Week 1, Gene Expression book club

The author reviews the extant literature and folk wisdom that humans are gullible, and not suspicious of people trying to swindle them. To a great extent, this is the mainstream view now, with the emergence of the “heuristics and biases” literature, and the field of “cultural evolution” which is rooted in the idea of social cognition.

Social cognition basically means instead of thinking things through yourself you allow the community to decide. As a hadith states, the Ummah shall not agree upon an error. It’s cheap, easy, and good enough. But, this reliance on community means that irrational herds can erupt, and the opportunity arises for ‘cheaters’ to game these systems of information flow (think ‘affinity scams’).

The first chapter of [Not Born Yesterday](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07W62V5WP/geneexpressio-20) is a capsule of the view not taken in this book, so I assume the best is yet to come.

This makes sense, because it’s history, and twice as long. For me, the most notable aspect is that [Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20) starts with a global scope, emphasizing the foreignness of the Manchus, and the close attention Europeans paid to the Taiping rebels. There is even a section where observers from the American South analogize the situation to their own slave society.

[Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20) is written engagingly, but I have to admit that many of the historical details might be difficult for readers not well versed in the broad canvas of Chinese history. But so far it promises a lot in the subsequent chapters, synthesizing social and political history.
