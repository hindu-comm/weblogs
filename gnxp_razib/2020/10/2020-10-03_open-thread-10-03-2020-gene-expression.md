Open Thread – 10/03/2020 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/birthofthewest.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/birthofthewest.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20)When I get busy and don’t post open threads you guys start leaving comments elsewhere (which is fine, since the articles/papers are usually pretty good). I’ll be better about posting, but from now on I’ll just “pin” the open thread post too… So page down if you don’t use an [RSS](https://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed) feed.

  
[The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20) has a lot of citations of [John Julius Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Julius_Norwich). If that doesn’t say something to you, basically there is a lot of personal biography. The title may seem to promise a deep structural understanding of what happened in the 10th century, but the book is mostly a detailed diplomatic history. People, battles, and treaties. There’s more structural/social stuff at the end. Save the best for last?

I much prefer something like Chris Wickham’s [Medieval Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ01AC8/geneexpressio-20). All that being said, [The Birth of the West](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20) pulls off narrative description well, and of course, I found out more about the “[pornocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornocracy)“. Always exciting!

In relation to the [“book club”](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/09/28/lets-read/#comments), I’ve made a final decision. **I’m reading two books.**

– [Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom: China, the West, and the Epic Story of the Taiping Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20)

– [Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and What We Believe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07W62V5WP/geneexpressio-20)

I’ll be reading the prologue/first chapter for both by next Friday and putting up blog posts. Interestingly, **both books have 16 chapters.** I’m going to combine chapter 1 and prologue, and the last chapter and epilogue. This means that the reading will run to the end of January 2021. Hopefully, we’ll have good vaccine news by then. My plan is to post every Friday on both books. Obviously, you can read both, or just one. [Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20) is about twice as long as [Not Born Yesterday](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07W62V5WP/geneexpressio-20), but my experience is cognitive science books are more difficult to read, so if you pick one, keep that in mind (depending on the interest I may do a Livestream discussion now and then that I’ll post on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan)).

In case you want a bookmark, I created an “event” page for the [Book Club](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/event/gene-expression-book-club-autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-not-born-yesterday/). As the posts come up I plan to link to each chapter review.

[The Advisor and the Slack Channel That (Sort Of) Singlehandedly Destroyed an NYU Newsroom](https://jezebel.com/the-advisor-and-the-slack-channel-that-sort-of-single-1845214591). This is from *Jezebel*, and it looks like older Millennials aren’t down with some of the poses struck by Zoomers. Do a “close reading.” The future is a joke.

[The Return of Indoor Dining in New York City Doesn’t Mean Business as Usual](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-return-of-indoor-dining-in-new-york-city-doesnt-mean-business-as-usual-11601408140?mod=hp_featst_pos4). The world has changed, hasn’t it?

[Ruchi in China](https://www.youtube.com/user/246ruchi). Sometimes I watch YouTube channels of foreigners living in China to see how “normal” their lives are now. This channel is hosted by an Indian woman who married a North Chinese man who lives in Guandong with their son. It’s pretty interesting insofar as it’s an unselfconscious ethnography of Chinese culture from the perspective of an outsider (e.g., when visiting her in-laws in Jilin she explains that they eat a lot of meat and drink a lot of alcohol because it gets so cold there; she’s from Rajasthan which is the most vegetarian state in India).

[Academic acceleration in gifted youth and fruitless concerns regarding psychological well-being: A 35-year longitudinal study.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-47023-001) Common sense. But not our experience as parents. The focus in America is on the 10%. The bottom 10%.

When I first began reading Brandon Sanderson 12 years ago I thought he was somewhat silly. A self-described Mormon “boy scout” he writes novels very different from the “grimdark” that was in vogue in the 2000s. But in this age and time perhaps a bit of boy scout perspective is necessary? To my surprise, Sanderson is coming out with his 4th volume in ten years of the Stormlight Chronicles, [Rhythm of War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0826NKZHR/geneexpressio-20). This is projected to be a ten-volume series. I was skeptical he could do this, but now I think he’ll hit his targets.
