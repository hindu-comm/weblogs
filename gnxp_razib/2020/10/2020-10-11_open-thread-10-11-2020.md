Am I a sucker for cheap Kindle books with high page counts? Yes. But I stopped eating out over the past year, so what’s a few dollars here and there?

Chris Wickham’s [Medieval Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ01AC8/geneexpressio-20) is also on sale. If you can afford [Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean, 400-800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006SF3M5G/geneexpressio-20), get that. But this is a decent book.

Here is the [book club event page](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/event/gene-expression-book-club-autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-not-born-yesterday/). I’ll update the links to the posts and the date periodically.

Some people ask me how I see book deals. I check [Kindle Daily Deals](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=11552285011). But not all price drops show up there. For example, [Shape of Ancient Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20) regularly is discounted. But, I do check my Amazon referrals and I often see readers of this weblog buying books that are surprisingly cheap and interesting. Unfortunately, that’s not a “secret” that others can make recourse too.

There are now estimates of [Bangladesh’s nominal GDP per capita](https://www.brownpundits.com/2020/10/11/beyond-the-bangladeshi-basket-case/) being higher than India. This masks high regional variation in India, but, it also shows how far Bangladesh has come. I’m mildly skeptical that Bangladesh can move up the value chain, but you take what you can get.

[Michael Fortner and the Black Silent Majority](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/michael-fortner-and-the-black-silent-majority). Interview on the Brown Pundits podcast. This is a really important book and Fortner is an important voice.

I don’t know much about K-Pop. Probably because I’m old now. But is this the sort of cultural synthesis we can expect from the 21st century?
