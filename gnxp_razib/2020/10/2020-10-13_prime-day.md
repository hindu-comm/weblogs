Prime Day!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20)It’s “Prime Day” (well, the second). I know it has nothing to do with Prime Day as such, but I really do recommend all of you read [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20). It’s getting out of date here and there, but it’s essential in 2020 if you are interested in the human past.

I’m surprised how two years on there hasn’t been much else that’s come out.

I recently cracked my primary Fire so I was using a backup. I realized that the backup was too heavy, and instead of getting one of the big Kindles I got a smaller one that’s lighter. I don’t really use the Kindles for surfing the web or watching movies, I have computers or smartphones for that. I have a paperwhite, but I do most of my reading on the fire.

I know some people don’t like reading on an e-reader, but it does make me much faster.
