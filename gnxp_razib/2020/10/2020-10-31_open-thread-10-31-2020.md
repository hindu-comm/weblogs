[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/misquotingmuha.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/misquotingmuha.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00M80KZ64/geneexpressio-20)I’m going to post about the book club late this week. Very busy and behind. Just a heads up, I haven’t forgotten.

[Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet’s Legacy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00M80KZ64/geneexpressio-20). The author is a white American convert to Islam, so this is an ‘orthodox’ treatment.

[Evidence for adaptive evolution in the receptor-binding domain of seasonal coronaviruses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.352914v1). From Trevor Bedford’s group. So read it.

[The Evolutionary History of Man’s Best Friend Revealed](https://quillette.com/2020/10/29/the-evolutionary-history-of-mans-best-friend-revealed/). A piece in *Quillette* where I talk about the new Bergstrom et al. paper.

[The evolution of social learning as phenotypic cue integration](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.358028v1).

[Americans hate each other. But we aren’t headed for civil war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/civil-war-united-states-unlikely-violence/2020/10/29/3a143936-0f0f-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html). An op-ed from my friend Richard Hanania. He presents political science data that makes it clear a civil war is unlikely. I think this is broadly correct, though I think our affluence and obesity are big variables. Many of my anti-Trump friends are terrified by a coup, but I think they are judging this wrong. The true dangers are coming later.

Richard also did an episode on his opinions about this and France on my [podcast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/religious-conflict-in-france-civil-war-in-america-and-the-post-modern-world).

[Reclaiming, on Netflix, an Ancient Battle Beloved of Germany’s Far Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/arts/television/barbarians-netflix.html). This quote: *Today’s Germans, Wemhoff noted, are descended from groups that came from other regions of Europe. “There is no continuity”*, is clearly false. There was a migration of the noble and warrior classes. But it seems clear the peasants remained, left behind, and there is broad continuity in Germany from the Bronze Age. After ancient DNA [Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0035KD36U/geneexpressio-20) reads better. If you haven’t read it, do so!

[Glenn Greenwald](https://greenwald.substack.com/) leaves for Substack. Greenwald is kind of a dick. He’s very disagreeable and often unpleasant. **This is one reason I actually *trust him* more than other journalists.** He deludes himself, he’s human, but he’s not a conformist, which is the norm among most journalists (look at the middle school level burns coming from some bluecheck reporters at places like *The New York Times*).

[Possible changes in fidelity of DNA polymerase δ in ancestral mammals](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.327619v1).

[Is degree of sociality associated with reproductive senescence? A comparative analysis across birds and mammals](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.360636v1).

[Genetic ancestry predicts male-female affiliation in a natural baboon hybrid zone](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.358002v1).

[How Hindu Nationalism Could Shape the Election](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/30/hindu-nationalism-election-indian-american-voters-433608). Uh, no.

Over at [Brown Pundits](https://www.brownpundits.com/) they asked me to create a [reddit group](https://www.brownpundits.com/2020/10/31/open-thread-10-31-2020-brown-pundits/). I did. I bit the bullet and went ahead and did the same for [GNXP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeneExpression/new/).
