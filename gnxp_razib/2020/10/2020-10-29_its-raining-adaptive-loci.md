It’s raining adaptive loci!

It never ends with these Denisovans. More and more results. Filling the gaps in our knowledge.

[Denisovan DNA found in cave on Tibetan Plateau](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/512):

> For today’s Buddhist monks, Baishiya Karst Cave, 3200 meters high on > the Tibetan Plateau, is holy. For the ancient Denisovans, extinct > hominins known only from DNA, teeth, and bits of bone found in another > cave 2800 kilometers away in Siberia, it was a favorite rest stop. > Last year, researchers proposed that a jawbone found long ago in the > Tibetan cave was Denisovan, based on its ancient proteins.

Tens of thousands of years of occupation by “Denisovans” in highland Tibet.\* The introgression into modern Tibetans, probably via a deeply basal “East Eurasian” Paleolithic lineage absorbed by rice farmers who migrated to the plateau in the last 10,000 years, makes more and more sense.

Related to this is a new paper on dogs, [Ancient Dog DNA Shows Early Spread Around the Globe](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/science/dogs-ancient-DNA-wolves.html). I’ll have a piece out on this in [Quillette](https://quillette.com/author/razib-khan/) shortly (as well as a podcast with the first author on my [substack](https://razib.substack.com/p/coming-soon). But here’s one aspect: **the Tibetan mastiff which has high altitude adaptation from Tibetan wolves doesn’t seem to show wolf admixture.**

So what’s going on? Well, very small levels of genome-wide admixture can still bring in beneficial adaptive loci. Perhaps this is more common in humans than we might imagine.

\* I put “Denisovans” in quotes because it is becoming clear East Eurasian hominins were a diverse group of populations with larger effective population sizes than West Eurasian hominins, Neanderthals. Denisovans are a clade, but one with many branches.
