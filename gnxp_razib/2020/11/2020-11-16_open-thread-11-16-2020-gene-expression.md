Open Thread – 11/16/2020 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rhythmofwar.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rhythmofwar.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0826NKZHR/geneexpressio-20)Tomorrow [Rhythm of War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0826NKZHR/geneexpressio-20) is out. This is the fourth of Brandon Sanderson’s ten-book Stormlight Archive. I began reading this series ten years ago, when my life was different. I don’t know when I have time to read this, but I will.

Sanderson’s work is not dark, and I need that now. Is it a coincidence I became a fan of George R. R. Martin in the 1990s?

Apologize for getting behind in the [book club](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/tag/book-club/). I’ll catch up!

The main reason is I’m kind of overwhelmed now, especially getting my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/p/coming-soon) up (this week!). I plan to put long-form essays and particular podcasts there. And more comment engagement. Thanks to everyone who subscribed before the announcement! (I’ll blast out an email to the Mailchimp lists soon)

[Matt Yglesias](https://www.slowboring.com/p/welcome-to-slow-boring) moved to Substack.

Another allocation of time: I’ll have a review of Alex Gibney’s new film, “Totally Under Control”, in Quillette soon. It’s OK. But kind of thin.

I’ll be taking suggestions on what to write about, but probably the two first essays will be a “short genetic history of the world” and the “closing of the liberal mind.”
