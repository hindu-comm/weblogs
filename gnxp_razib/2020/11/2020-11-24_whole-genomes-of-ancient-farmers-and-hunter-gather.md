Whole genomes of ancient farmers and hunter-gatherers

A new preprint uses about a dozen ancient genomes to create a model of the origins of Europeans and European farmers more precisely. The big deal here is that they aren’t relying on the same old SNP-array, but using the whole genome. This allows for some more explicit model-building and testing. **I do think explicit model creation is something that needs to be done.** A lot of the work today is data-first, and there needs to be more “theory”.

[The mixed genetic origin of the first farmers of Europe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.23.394502v1):

> While the Neolithic expansion in Europe is well described > archaeologically, the genetic origins of European first farmers and > their affinities with local hunter-gatherers (HGs) remain unclear. To > infer the demographic history of these populations, the genomes of 15 > ancient individuals located between Western Anatolia and Southern > Germany were sequenced to high quality, allowing us to perform > population genomics analyses formerly restricted to modern genomes. We > find that all European and Anatolian early farmers descend from the > merging of a European and a Near Eastern group of HGs, possibly in the > Near East, shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Western and > Southeastern European HG are shown to split during the LGM, and share > signals of a very strong LGM bottleneck that drastically reduced their > genetic diversity. Early Neolithic Central Anatolians seem only > indirectly related to ancestors of European farmers, who probably > originated in the Near East and dispersed later on from the Aegean > along the Danubian corridor following a stepwise demic process with > only limited (2-6%) but additive input from local HGs. Our analyses > provide a time frame and resolve the genetic origins of early European > farmers. They highlight the impact of Late Pleistocene climatic > fluctuations that caused the fragmentation, merging and reexpansion of > human populations in SW Asia and Europe, and eventually led to the > world’s first agricultural populations.

The supplements are worth reading too. It’s all there.

No mention of Basal Eurasians. The last author told me on Twitter that they weren’t needed, but Iosif Lazaridis (also on Twitter) disagrees, naturally.
