Open Thread – 11/08/2020 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/americannations.jpeg?resize=304%2C304&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/americannations.jpeg?resize=304%2C304&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0052RDIZA/geneexpressio-20)I’ve been busy with a lot of things this week. **I plan on putting up a post on the “book club” early this week.**

Lots of stuff happening in the USA today. I think some historical context would help explain it. I also think going back to the past is not feasible.

I’m seeing a lot of chatter by young scientists that one should question whether one should engage in certain types of basic science due to their ethical/moral implications. This is not a crazy viewpoint, but I doubt the people airing these thoughts understand the long historical context of this line of thought. Once the principle is conceded those who have been making these claims for decades, that science should be integrated and a servent of moral-ethical systems, are on much stronger ground.

The idea that widespread dissemination of the idea that truth for truth’s sake is possibly dangerous is almost certainly going to undermine support and funding for basic science.
