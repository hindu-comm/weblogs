I don’t read too many books on Indian history to be honest, because there seems to be a death of them (perhaps they are printed in India?). This is in contrast to China. Then again, China has a much stronger tradition of premodern history writing (which, to a great extent, is really Muslim observations of India).

Everyone should know some population genetics and some quantitative genetics. OK, not everyone. But more.

[University of Chicago only accepting English students willing to work in black studies](https://nypost.com/2020/09/15/uchicago-only-admitting-english-students-to-work-in-black-studies/). A lot of conservatives are mad. First, I don’t think this is sincere. They don’t want to admit people this year, and, the faculty want to just say that they did this to avoid accusations of racism. Look at all the [old white people](https://english.uchicago.edu/people/faculty-and-lecturers) collecting salaries in their English department (seems like they’ve really increased diversity in the assistant professor track though).

Second, for most people, even at an elite university, studying the humanities is a scam. Instead of demanding that these universities take ten years of someone’s life to do a novel interpretation of a Shakespeare play, more people should be reading Shakespeare, period. The current system is not sustainable.

I wrote this [spring of 2017](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/05/19/the-eternal-axial-age/):

> Sulla is efficient. Cruel, but certain in his rightness. Sulla is not > a clown. He is not narcissistic, for Sulla does have ideals, even if > you hold that those ideals are cruel or callous. Sulla is a piece of > furniture, found in many places at many times. The United States of > America has not seen Sulla yet. I believe it will.

I have no idea why I had such a dark vision of America in 2017. But I did. And in some ways, I think I was justified. The main difference now is I am not so sure that the lictors will ever come. Perversion, not proscriptions.
