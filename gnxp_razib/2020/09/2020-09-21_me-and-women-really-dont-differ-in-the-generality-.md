Men and women really don’t differ in the generality on abortion

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webpreview_htm_3357d8a6.jpg?resize=625%2C613&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/webpreview_htm_3357d8a6.jpg?resize=625%2C613&ssl=1)

Many years ago I wrote an [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/opinion/the-abortion-stereotype.html) which reported the simple and obvious fact that there isn’t a difference between men and women when it comes to abortion as a policy issue. The only reason that the op-ed was written is that the media seem to be under the impression that women are more pro-choice than men. Not really.

Now that abortion is in the news again I thought I’d check the GSS to see if anything had changed in the last few cycles. As you can see, nothing much has (perhaps a tilt toward more support for abortion rights?). Also, the plot above should make it clear: men and women seem to change their opinions in sync. Basically there is broad social consensus impacting both sexes.

The correlation between the two series over the years is 0.83. So your eyes aren’t lying.
