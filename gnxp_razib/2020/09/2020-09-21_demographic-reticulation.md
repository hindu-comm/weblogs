Demographic Reticulation!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20)I made an offhand comment on Twitter that it would take a few decades for the public to understand the insight that demographic reticulation is ubiquitous in human prehistory. This is probably the biggest claim in [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20).

Well, it turns out that that [is a new phrase](https://twitter.com/Steve_Sailer/status/1307981558339391490). I confirmed it myself. If Google is perplexed, it must be a novelty.

As many of you know ‘populations’ are constructs. Really what’s happening is that we’re tracing the genealogies of genes, and those summary genealogies give us insights into population splits and mixture.

[Reticulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulate_evolution) is a pretty general concept in evolution and genetics. I didn’t really know what other terms to give the dynamic I was alluding to.

What other term describes the process you see in the admixture graph below?
