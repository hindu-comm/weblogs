Gene flow, again and again, even unto Neandersovans

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/F1.large_.jpg?resize=640%2C689&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/F1.large_.jpg?resize=640%2C689&ssl=1)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/8/eaay5483)  
The Alan Rogers paper which includes ideas of “super-archaics”, is finally out, [Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly related hominin](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/8/eaay5483). It’s open access, so I encourage you to read it. In it, the authors looking at patterns of derived mutations that vary between populations and try and see which models fit the pattern. I’ve added some labels to the figure above for clarity. The raw results in [figure 2](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/6/8/eaay5483/F2.large.jpg) are easy enough to understand. **But how do they go from that to the model?**

I haven’t reread the [legofit paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3154-1), so honestly, I don’t know the details. Rather, I’m more interested in the discussion:

Basically, the genetic results have been conflicting with the archaeology in a really strange way for a long time. The geneticists keep saying that the divergence between Neanderthals and Denisovans is relatively recent, and the Neanderthal fossils predate the estimated split. This is a case where I trust the paleoanthropology people, so methods that resolve this problem are welcome.

More broadly, **I assume some form of this model is correct, even if not in the details.** With what we know today, it seems unlikely that pre-Neanderthal/Denisovan humans did not mix with the newcomers. These results indicate that in fact these earlier archaic groups mixed with the expanding proto-Neanderthal/Denisovan population, the Neandersovans.

**Update:** A friend who I trust looked closely at the legofit paper. He says “I don’t believe a word of this shit.”
