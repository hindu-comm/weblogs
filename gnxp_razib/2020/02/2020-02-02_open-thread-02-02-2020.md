There is a lot more talk on backchannels than you see in this piece, partly because until the full investigation is complete people don’t feel comfortable airing suspicions and rumors. But, it is likely to get worse before it gets better from everything I hear.

Last week a friend in psychology asked whether this was similar to [Diederik Stapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diederik_Stapel). I said at the time that it wasn’t that bad, but I’m really not sure anymore.

[Is It Fair to Award Scholarships Based on the SAT?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-it-fair-to-award-scholarships-based-on-the-sat-11580639400) Being *WSJ* the piece at least mentions Asians. “Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts stopped using the test for merit scholarships last year, said Andrew Palumbo, dean of admission. Instead, the school is weighing grades, community service and leadership.” Biased against Asians, since it is known Asians lack “leadership.” Also, grades will basically disappear as a useful measure since all mostly pre-college prep high schools will be under pressure to give good grades. As for community service, which economic class has the most time for this?

I quite enjoyed the last Mercier book, [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067423782X/geneexpressio-20).

I would appreciate more positive reviews for [The Insight](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?ls=1&mt=2) on Apple Podcasts. This week we’ll be posting an episode I recorded with Anders Bergstrom on the genetics of New Guinea.

Finally starting to go through it.

I haven’t been tracking the impeachment or coronavirus since I don’t think they’ll seem too consequential in a few years.
