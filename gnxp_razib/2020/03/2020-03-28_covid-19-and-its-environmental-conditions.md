COVID-19 and its environmental conditions

The same sort of logic seems to apply when it comes to talking about the environmental parameters which might affect the progress of COVID-19, such as temperature, humidity, and density. Many people seem to strenuously want to deny there is any plausible evidence that COVID-19 might exhibit seasonality. There is a fair amount of correlational work which suggests that there is an environmental factor shaping the spread and depth of COVID-19. And, we know three out of the four previous coronaviruses exhibit seasonality.

Well, I noticed this note on medRxiv today, [Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036673v2). It’s a very short write-up of their experimental results. I don’t really know much about virology so I can’t evaluate it well, but you can see the figure above. As you increase the temperature the virus titer seems to drop much faster. At a very high temperature of 70 Celsius, they basically can’t detect anything after 1 minute.

Here is one of the better correlational analyses, using some sophisticated techniques, [Causal empirical estimates suggest COVID-19 transmission rates are highly seasonal](https://t.co/8Xfpq6DW7c?amp=1):

To be clear. Does this mean weather/climate determine whether COVID-19 will spread or not? No. Rather, I think that weather/climate has some effect on the margin on the R₀. I am not sure of the exact reason, but if the virus degrades much faster in hot climates, that could be one explanation of why spreading is more limited. It also does not seem to be the case that tropical countries are going to avoid mass healthcare crises. Rather, as these countries formulate policies to decrease R₀, it may not be as long of a haul.

I believe that many are worried that if there is **some** relationship between temperature and COVID-19, people will think they are safe in a particular climate. The way to deal with this is not to ratchet up skepticism to an inordinately high extent. Rather, it is to be more clear and careful in how one presents the data.

Similarly, I think density has some impact. But, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan show that density does not seal one’s fate.
