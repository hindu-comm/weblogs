Blood group A at greater risk from COVID-19 (maybe)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tempmicro.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tempmicro.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2007/11/12/abortion-blood-groups/)To a great extent much of the population genetics of humans in the 20th-century that doesn’t involve external traits is the population genetics of blood groups. A, B, and O, along with Rhesus factor. Read L. L. Cavalli-Sforza and William Bodmer’s [The Genetics of Human Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20), the first edition of which was written in the 1960s. The emergence of more genetic markers, and Y, mtDNA, and genome-wide analysis has marginalized the exploration of population genetic variation of ABO. But it’s still useful. And it’s still functionally important (there’s a reason that A and B groups evolved!).

Many years ago while reading Alan Templeton’s [Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409510/geneexpressio-20/) I stumbled upon the fact that [spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is associated with blood group differences between mother and fetus](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2007/11/12/abortion-blood-groups/) on [![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanpopgenetics.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/humanpopgenetics.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20)the ABO blood groups. Basically, women who are O (and so genotype OO) have issues with fetuses that express A or B antigen. This isn’t deterministic, just a change in probabilities (I’m A, my wife is O, and our children are a mix, as my genotype is AO).

ABO has also been associated with different risks to different diseases (e.g., it is well known that those who express blood group B are more at risk for Hepatitis B).

So with that, a new preprint, [ABO blood group and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096v1):

> …The ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan showed a distribution of > 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, > versus the distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, > AB and O, respectively, in 1775 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Jinyintan > Hospital.

Similar ABO distribution pattern was > observed in 398 patients from another two hospitals in Wuhan and > Shenzhen. **Meta-analyses on the pooled data showed that blood group A > had a significantly higher risk for** COVID-19 (odds ratio-OR, 1.20; > 95% confidence interval-CI 1.02\~1.43, P = 0.02) compared with non-A > blood groups, **whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk** > for the infectious disease (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60\~0.75, P \< 0.001) > compared with non-O blood groups.

It looks like from their data that A individuals were:

1\) more likely to get infected  
2) more likely to have severe responses

The **individual difference is modest.** You aren’t invulnerable if you are O. But, this might impact the course and severity of COVID-19 as it runs through populations…

Here is the table:

[South China Morning Post has a good write-up](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3075567/people-blood-type-may-be-more-vulnerable-coronavirus-china-study). Here are blood group distributions if you don’t know them offhand (they are pre-Columbian):
