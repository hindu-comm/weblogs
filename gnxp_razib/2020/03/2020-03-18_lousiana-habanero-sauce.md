Lousiana Habanero Sauce!

We are stocked up with toilet paper (got our usual year’s worth in early February) and all the basics, but you know, I need flavor. Normally I order small batches from [Fuego](https://www.fuegobox.com/?discount=SAUCE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjcfzBRCHARIsAO-1_OpD4Id46eEQs9l_wU-j-v-WTkjSLTxGt1TcLCfseG8sdZ6Y4_AzfFEaAu6HEALw_wcB&next=%2F) or browse the hot sauce selection in gourmet markets, but this isn’t really a time for that.

So I ordered a 1-gallon container of [Louisiana brand habanero sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SFK8KXC/geneexpressio-20).

Thoughts? I’d give it 8 out of 10. A B+. This is something I would recommend if you are holed up in semi-quarantine. First, it’s a lot of sauce. Greater value. Second, it is spicy a.f. This is real habanero. It packs a big punch. Third, it has the nice tangy flavor of classic Louisiana cayenne hot sauce.

But in that’s actually this sauces the main downside: **it’s basically just conventional Louisana hot sauce on steroids**. Nothing creative or new. It’s the same flavor profile that you know and love, just amped up.

Definitely a recommended sauce. Just know what you’re getting.
