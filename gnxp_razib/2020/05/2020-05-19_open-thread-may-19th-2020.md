Open Thread – May 19th, 2020

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/birthofthewest.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/birthofthewest.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20)I noticed [The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20) is \$3.49 on Kindle. So I got it. It’s 500 pages and people complain it’s too academic. So what else could I do?

Please give [The Insight](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) more 5-star ratings (or [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight). Unlike many podcasts, our downloads have increased during the quarantine.

Tanner Greer, [China’s Plans to Win Control of the Global Order](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-plans-global-order), and Francis Fukuyama, [What Kind of Regime Does China Have?](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2020/05/18/what-kind-of-regime-does-china-have/) The real issue is that noninterventionist soft-authoritarianism was fine. Interventionist totalitarianism? That’s different. As Fukuyama and Greer both note the latter is more an **aspiration** than a reality. We’ll see.

[Tractor: A framework allowing for improved inclusion of admixed individuals in large-scale association studies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.17.100727v1). This is a big deal.

[Global cooling event 4,200 years ago spurred rice’s evolution, spread across Asia](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115646.htm). The argument here is that Austro-Asiatic migrations were triggered by this cooling event.

[The End of the Harvard Century](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-china-scrutiny/). Again, about China. The issue here is Harvard needs to figure out what it’s about: power or scholarship? Scholarship gives one freedom to think. Power means one can’t afford to consider practicalities.
