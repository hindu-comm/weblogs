Let’s hope the 21st century is not another Red Century

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kapital.jpeg?resize=263%2C368&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kapital.jpeg?resize=263%2C368&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002RI9D2E/geneexpressio-20)A few years ago [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/column/red-century) had a strange series of articles about Communism, [“Red Century”](https://www.nytimes.com/column/red-century). Some of the pieces seemed almost laudatory of Communism and the Soviet Union. I don’t necessarily think that everything I read should have the same moral stances as I do, but much of the contemporary media is **highly moralistic** in regard to matters of history. So it struck me as a rather strange that the ideology under whose banners the highest totalitarian body counts of the 20th century occurred should be given a “fair shake.”

I thought of this because there was a recent “Twitter controversy” about the unacceptability of some books that some people had on their bookshelves. These were, of course, Lefty scolds of the usual sort. But it got me thinking: in my books, I believe I have Karl Marx’s [Das Kapital](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002RI9D2E/geneexpressio-20) volumes along with Adam Smith’s [An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B087ZCSYDF/geneexpressio-20). The reason I have these books is that I thought perhaps I should go and refamiliarize myself with the 18th and 19th century precursors of modern economic and social thought.

As it happens I’ve never been able to devote much time to reading Marx or Smith. My ownership of books by Karl Marx, and, Christian apologetics, is due to the fact that I read lots of stuff I don’t “agree” with. Sometimes you read things you disagree with. That seems what a curious and liberal-minded person should do? This is just very old-fashioned now?

But it brings me to a final point. This is Karl Marx’s birthday. I don’t know much about his biography besides the simple sketch. **Would he have been shocked and outraged as a person by the millions who were killed in his name in the 20th century?** Do readers know?
