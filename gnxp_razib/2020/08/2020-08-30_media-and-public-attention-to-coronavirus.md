Media and public attention to coronavirus

I haven’t been talking about coronavirus much. What’s there to talk about? In April I tried to be optimistic, and well that didn’t work out. We’re not at worst-case disaster scenarios, but likely “excess deaths” of 200,000 don’t look good. The idea expressed by some (and which I really hoped for) that weather or decreased virulence would “take care” of coronavirus seems to have not panned out.

The two very positive things for me are:

– children seem relatively unscathed. The original age-trends hold

– the outdoor spread is very low. The “superspreader” events tend to happen indoors

A possible point of optimism, which I’m uncertain of, is that “herd immunity” may in some cases be lower than 70%. In many areas, it looks like “herd immunity” is really what’s going to happen, though treatments and vaccines may be important for some regions (e.g., Taiwan).

Anyway, I was curious about public and media concern about coronavirus, so I looked at Google Trends. You can see the public, against the baseline peak, tends to delay a bit. The American media also seems to have gotten bored with coronavirus into the middle of February, just like all of society (this is when some of the really stupid pieces making fun of coronavirus alarmists showed up in the bluecheck clickbait world).
