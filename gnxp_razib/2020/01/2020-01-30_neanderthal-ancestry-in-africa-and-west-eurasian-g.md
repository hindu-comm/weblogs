Neanderthal ancestry in Africa and West Eurasian gene flow

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/graphabstract.jpg?resize=600%2C603&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/graphabstract.jpg?resize=600%2C603&ssl=1)](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30059-3#secsectitle0080)  
A new (open access) paper in *Cell*, [Identifying and Interpreting Apparent Neanderthal Ancestry in African Individuals](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30059-3#secsectitle0080), is making a big splash in the media. Whether you believe this paper on its own is conditional on how deeply you can grok the [methods](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30059-3#secsectitle0080). Honestly I don’t know if I trust myself to render any judgment until I’ve replicated the whole analysis pipeline. Intuition doesn’t come from a priori.

That being said, **in light of other factors and our general understanding of hominin gene flow this is a highly plausible result.** They conclude that “A model that combines both of these events, elevated back migration and human-to-Neanderthal gene flow, matches the empirical data best across all features.” Gene flow from neo-African modern humans into Neanderthals seems very likely. Similarly, it is quite possible that there was widespread Eurasian back migration into Africa. But, that back migration was *West Eurasian*.

The “problem” with the older models is that it simply assumed that groups such as the Yoruba had no Neanderthal ancestry, presupposing a particular model of paleoanthropological gene flow where Africa is purely a source, rather than also a sink. Assume nothing!
