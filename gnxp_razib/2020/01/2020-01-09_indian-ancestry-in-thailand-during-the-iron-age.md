Indian Ancestry In Thailand During the Iron Age

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thailandhistory.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thailandhistory.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1107420210/geneexpressio-20)A follow-up to my previous [post](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/01/05/indian-ancestry-in-cambodia-was-present-2000-years-ago/), one of the “Iron Age” samples from Thailand seems a definite outlier in comparison to the other Iron Age and Bronze Age samples. There is suggestive evidence again of Indian ancestry, as one sees in the plot above. One of the samples from Thailand overlaps with the Cambodians and Burmese, who do seem to have South Asian shift, while the other samples from Thailand do not. Today most Thais seem to show some Indian ancestry as well, at low levels.

Unfortunately, much of Southeast Asian history before 1000 A.D. is pretty much a cipher. Perhaps the best survey I’ve seen is [Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800–1830](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZKNRFN/geneexpressio-20), though even there it’s rather thin before the arrival of the Tai and the shocks that entailed for the earlier Indic societies of Southeast Asia.
