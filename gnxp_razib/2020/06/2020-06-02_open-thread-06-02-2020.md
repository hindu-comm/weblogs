But in the short-term they’re exhilarating.

When violence broke out last week and the looting started I was downcast. It was “explained,” by some among the intelligentsia that property crime was not truly violent against people, these, the same people who talk about the “violence” of words. The reality is that in the midst of the greatest economic contraction in generations the shock of the looting will redound to us all, though currently, the major sufferers that I think about are the owners of small businesses that were already struggling during the quarantine. But violence, disturbance, and fear impact us all indirectly. Lack of order, and low confidence the authorities, have major impacts on the accumulation of capital.

The best analogy to how people feel right now perhaps is the time after 9/11. Americans were angry. The invasion of Iraq was basically something that happened because “we wanted to break something.” That did not turn out well for anyone. The combination of the pandemic, economic stress, and the [Great Awokening](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020), set the conditions for an explosion. We’ll be cleaning up the mess for years.
