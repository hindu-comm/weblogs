Louisiana Habanero Hot Sauce…again!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/louisanagallon-1.jpeg?resize=178%2C335&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/louisanagallon-1.jpeg?resize=178%2C335&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SFK8KXC/geneexpressio-20)Three months ago, early on in the quarantine, I purchased some [Louisiana Brand Habanero Hot Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SFK8KXC/geneexpressio-20). In fact, I purchased 1 gallon. The reason was quarantine. I was clearly not going to go shopping for small batches, so I wanted a big one. And I wanted it to be hot, and have a simple and clean flavor. And [Louisiana Brand Habanero](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SFK8KXC/geneexpressio-20) was just that.

Now that three months have passed, I’m almost out. So I purchased some more. I will try other hot sauces, but this stuff really gets me 80-90% of the way there, and as long as we’re not really going shopping in person this seems best (I used to use [Fuego](https://www.fuegobox.com/?discount=SAUCE&gclid=CjwKCAjwxLH3BRApEiwAqX9arR8UnednfMfOX5yoeIXqLYwjtvZD7ObfHAhmOaL3bwciU33ZGhD3OBoCj9AQAvD_BwE&next=%2F), but it all seemed a bit precious).

Anyway, if [The Fall of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20)*the*history book you should get, this is the hot sauce equivalent.
