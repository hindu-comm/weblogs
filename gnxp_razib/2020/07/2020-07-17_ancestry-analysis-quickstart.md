Ancestry analysis quickstart

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KanayaReferenceNoOutgroupKeralaHigh8.jpg?resize=300%2C750&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KanayaReferenceNoOutgroupKeralaHigh8.jpg?resize=300%2C750&ssl=1)Over the years I have posted periodic tutorials on how to do some simple admixture analysis. Initially this was to foster the growth of “genome blogging”, but that’s basically dead along with blogging as a whole ([Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/) being the primary exception here).

But, unexpectedly it turns out a lot of baby-academics find my tutorials early in graduate school or when they are trying to transition into ancestry inference in population genetics. I have lots of scripts I use myself, but they are not too organized or clear to others. But, I did create two tutorials for simple pipelines that are useful to others, judging by how many emails I get.

The reason I get emails is occasionally I delete the scripts in the process of housekeeping…but I’ve now created a folder “tutorials” that I will make sure NOT to delete. So all the files are present below at the links now:

– [Tutorial To Run PCA, Admixture, Treemix And Pairwise Fst In One Command](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/07/11/tutorial-to-run-pca-admixture-treemix-and-pairwise-fst-in-one-command/)

– [Tutorial To Run Supervised Admixture Analyses](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/07/13/tutorial-to-run-supervised-admixture-analyses/)

In the near future, I’m going to clean up and post more scripts (e.g., some I use to make qpAdmin outputs earlier). But I will update this particular blog post since I think these posts are more useful/relevant for people doing web searches than regular readers.
