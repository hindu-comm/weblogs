Let’s talk about sexual selection and Charles Darwin

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thedescentofmanselection.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thedescentofmanselection.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07474P4SX/geneexpressio-20)Charles Darwin famously posited the origin of species through adaptation driven by natural selection. The theory of evolution as we understand it. But another of Darwin’s major ideas was that sexual selection was very important in driving diversity within species. More specifically Darwin thought that female choosiness was critical and explained why in species such as birds the males were so much more “showy.”

Sexual selection is a huge field of study, and it’s hard to deny that it is a real thing. But, there has long been an argument about the efficacy of sexual selection within humans. Depending on how you define it, it does not seem that humans are particularly sexually dimorphic compared to common chimpanzees and gorillas, for example. This goes back to whether we are polygynous or monogamous. Because of high reproductive variation for males in polygyny sexual selection can drive changes really fast (e.g., one super-fit male can produce huge numbers of offspring). The situation in monogamy is more difficult since there is less reproductive variance.

A new preprint seems to suggest that selection is happening on males, even today, due to deleterious genes. [Sex-biased reduction in reproductive success drives selective constraint on human genes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.116111v1):

> Genome-wide sequencing of human populations has revealed substantial > variation among genes in the intensity of purifying selection acting > on damaging genetic variants. While genes under the strongest > selective constraint are highly enriched for Mendelian disorders, most > of these genes are not associated with disease and therefore the > nature of the selection acting on them is not known. **Here we show > that genetic variants that damage these genes reduce reproductive > success substantially in males but much less so in females.** We > present evidence that this reduction is mediated by cognitive and > behavioural traits, which renders male carriers of such variants less > likely to find mating partners. Our findings represent strong genetic > evidence that Darwin’s theory of sexual selection is shaping the gene > pool of contemporary human populations. Furthermore, our results > suggest that sexual selection can account for about a quarter of all > purifying selection acting on human genes.

The major reason seems to be that males can’t find a partner. If they can find a partner, the effect is much weaker. Basically, this is detecting an increase in childlessness.

A plausible explanation is that it impacts fertility, but the above indicates that that is not the case. And, the deleterious mutations aren’t enriched in the testes, nor does pruning out loci with known reproductive effects remove the impact. The authors also looked at intelligence. Those with mutations were not as intelligent, but that can’t explain most of the effect (and obviously it didn’t have much of an impact on women). The same with known conditions such as schizophrenia. Rather, what’s going on is that people are picking up on overall “genetic quality.”

This is in **British people.** And, the samples from the Biobank tend to be somewhat healthier than average. There is a lot more work to be done with a lot more samples. **But this is an awesome result in that it synthesizes the power and methods of modern genomics with a classical evolutionary hypothesis about the shape of human variation.**

The main question I have regarding sexual selection then is what will the results in other societies be? As per Joe Henrich’s recent book, [The WEIRDEST People in the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07RZFCPMD/geneexpressio-20), the British have been in enforced monogamy for 1,000 years. Purifying selection could be much stronger in some non-WEIRD societies (and in inbred Arab cultures cousin-marriage would also ‘expose’ recessive alleles faster). That might mean there aren’t as many deleterious alleles. Or, it could be the effect is much stronger in those who have no children (males).

This is just the beginning. Perhaps it’s time to reread Geoffrey Miller’s [The Mating Mind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006F2182G/geneexpressio-20)?
