[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1billionamericans.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1billionamericans.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593190211/geneexpressio-20)I got a review copy of [One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593190211/geneexpressio-20). I’m curious about this because I’ve become much more open to flooding the country with immigrants since I of the opinion our elites have gone insane.

I also got a copy of Virginia Postrel’s [The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1541617606/geneexpressio-20). Obscure fact: Postrel’s husband read this weblog in its early years.

Don’t know what I’m going to read next after [One Billion Americans](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593190211/geneexpressio-20). A lot of books that are in my “to-read” list. Don’t want to read anything about Islam for a while, and perhaps I should avoid cultural evolution. But I think I’m going to get to Hugo Mercier’s [Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and What We Believe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691178704/geneexpressio-20).

Part of it is I’m lax on quality control, but once you get a certain amount of engagement then a feedback loop occurs.

Speaking of Indians, I contributed a chapter to [Which of Us are Aryans?](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9388292383/geneexpressio-20) It’s been out for a while, but I just got my payment so I remembered it again.

I’m toying with the idea of a weekly “Patron livechat” for my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan) supporters. The main reason for the Patreon is to compensate for the [Brown Pundits podcast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/), which costs me some money to host and edit.

[Genetic basis of offspring number and body weight variation in Drosophila melanogaster](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203406v1?rss=1).

[Early Medieval Genetic Data from Ural Region Evaluated in the Light of Archaeological Evidence of Ancient Hungarians](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200154v1?rss=1). Magyars are who we thought they were.

[How robust are cross-population signatures of polygenic adaptation in humans?](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200030v1?rss=1) Not very robust.

[What Journalists Say When No One is Watching](https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/what-journalists-say-when-one-is). Journalists are class. Not objective observers.

Why does the journalistic drama resemble **Middle School**? That is, the tween-years of 11-13? My hypothesis is that tweens aren’t having sex yet, or serious relationships, or preparing for career/college. But, they now have hormones. That is why social infighting is so intense during this period. A lot of the arguments among journalists seem to be incredibly vicious back-biting over a shrinking pie. It’s not future-oriented, but present-fixated. Unfortunately, this is a case with capitalism is driving us away from virtue. Journalism with monopoly rents was more mature.

[What the Post-Trump Right Will Look Like](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-12/post-trump-right-will-focus-on-china-internet-and-the-left). Tyler Cowen.

I haven’t been saying much about COVID-19 because it seems like we’re going to just keep going until herd, vaccination, or a really good therapeutic. Depressing.
