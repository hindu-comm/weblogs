Umayyad invention of the idea of Islam

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/muhammadempires.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/muhammadempires.jpeg?resize=185%2C273&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0844Q8CL2/geneexpressio-20)A few months ago I wrote [The Myth Of Arabian Paganism, And The Jewish-Christian Origins Of The Umayyads](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/04/28/the-myth-of-arabian-paganism-and-the-jewish-christian-origins-of-the-umayyads/). Some readers suggested I look at Sean Anthony’s [Muhammad and the Empires of Faith: The Making of the Prophet of Islam](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0844Q8CL2/geneexpressio-20). After finishing [Muhammad and the Empires of Faith](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0844Q8CL2/geneexpressio-20) there are no **major** revisions I would make the earlier post. But, there are some changes in the details of my confidence of various aspects of the post.

First, **the historical Muhammad existed.** This seems to be something I can say with high confidence. Higher than before I read [Muhammad and the Empires of Faith](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0844Q8CL2/geneexpressio-20). The figure of Muhammad and many banal details of his life seems to be very likely. More likely than the historical Jesus (who I also believe existed as a Jewish reformer and prophet). In addition to Muhammad, something like the Koran in broad form also existed quite early.

Second, **I am much more sure than the basis of a crisp and distinct Muslim identity which serves as the core of a universal salvation religion dates to the period in and around the [Second Fitna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Fitna), between 680 and 692.** Basically, the texts seem to suggest to me that the Umayyad Caliph who came out of the conflict in victory engaged in fence-mending with the rebel faction, which was based out of the city of Mecca. The last decade of the 690s and early 700s is when we see the proliferation of distinctly Islamic aspects of the Arab Empire, from the phasing out of Greek in administration, to the separation between Muslims and Christians in the church in Damascus where they had earlier worshipped together. This is the period when the formula which we are so familiar with in regards to Muhammad’s prophethood comes to the foreground.

All that being said, I want to distinguish an Islamic **identity** from the substance and form of what Islam means today. [Muhammad and the Empires of Faith](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0844Q8CL2/geneexpressio-20) makes it clear that the roots of many Islamic traditions and practices do date to the Umayyads (e.g., hadith culture was not created out of thin air). But it is during the Abbassids, after 750, that the flesh was put upon the skeleton of the religion created by the Umayyads. That flesh is a function of the reality that the Abbassid Islam transcended Arab identity through the assimilation of large numbers of Iranians of Zoroastrian, Christian, and Buddhist, backgrounds. Umayyad already had a potentiality of universality, but when Islam truly became multi-ethnic, with non-Arab Muslims retaining their own independent national identities, a rapid consensus of what Islam was and is emerged.

To recap:

– The basic “furniture” to assemble the House of Islam was present in the early 7th century

– The foundations of the house date to the last quarter of the 7th century

– The house was completed in the last half of the Umayyad period and into the early Abbassid period

– The house was furnished, decorated, and painted, in the period between 750 and 900 AD, so that by 900 AD it looks just like the house we know today
