At this point, I am curious about something that is more like economic history (yes, I’ve read [The Great Divergence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0093HEKLQ/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=-mgngnlJZcXYYRNtyUzTMA&slotNum=0&imprToken=Jq8d5if2Gritxc0D.HmJ7g&slotNum=47&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)). Recommendations?

Here is a fact I learned from[Imperial China 900–1800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674012127/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=tl8L9xPCiLdZSugVu1M-qA&slotNum=7&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=GqkJYB5R0vMIGDdFkrTyeA&slotNum=48)that might be of interest: in the late 17th century the expanding Manchu Empire (which had conquered China) and Russia began to jostle for power in Inner Asia, and the [Khalkha Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalkha_Mongols), the Mongols proper, were deciding which side to align with. I had long known that the Khalkha Mongols had aligned with the Manchus. What became the Manchu imperial line had a genealogical relationship with the Mongols, as they would often take wives from a particular group of Mongol tribes (Kangxi Emperor’s paternal grandmother [was a Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Xiaozhuang)). [Imperial China](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674012127/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=tl8L9xPCiLdZSugVu1M-qA&slotNum=7&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=GqkJYB5R0vMIGDdFkrTyeA&slotNum=48)makes it clear that Mongol cavalry units were critical elements of the Manchu military machine, and as the Manchu assimilated into the Han culture they became arguably even more important as a population which could provide militarily ready men at a moment’s notice.

But a more interesting aspect of the Manchu alliance with the Mongols are the ethnoreligious implications, and what they wrought across Inner Asia. The Khalkha had become Tibetan Buddhists by the time the Manchus conquered China. According to[Imperial China](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674012127/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=tl8L9xPCiLdZSugVu1M-qA&slotNum=7&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=GqkJYB5R0vMIGDdFkrTyeA&slotNum=48),their religious leaders argued for the furtherance of their alliance as junior partners to the Manchus as opposed to the expanding Russians in part because the Manchus were more respectful of Buddhism. Mind you, the Manchus were not themselves Tibetan Buddhists, though they were always keen to co-opt the various prominent Tibetan lamas. But, they had earlier practiced Chinese and Korean forms of Buddhism (as the Jurchens) and seemed [resistant to Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people#Buddhism) in comparison to the Mongols.

The Russian Empire was obviously dominated by an Eastern Orthodox Christian elite. But, eventually, they made accommodations with various minority religions, including Buddhism. But, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and non-Orthodox Christianity were all subordinate religions. Historically non-Orthodox ethnic groups invariably suffered erosion due to the social advancement which conversion to Orthodoxy entailed. From the viewpoint of meta-ethnic identity, the Manchus were clearly superior to the Russians, as the Manchus tended toward more neutrality in religion than the Russians.

![Dzungaria in red](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/300px-Xinjiang_regions_simplified.jpg?resize=200%2C152&ssl=1)

And yet there are two conditions that need to be highlighted here. **The Manchus were responsible for the ethnic cleansing of the Mongol Dzungar tribes in the 18th century**. The Dzungars were the last great Inner Asian polity to challenge the gunpowderempires. They were arguably the final flowering of the steppe and its way of war. Unlike the Khalkha Mongols the Dzungar tribes, who were Oirat, were not part of the Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan. Ethnically somewhat distinct, the Dzungar nevertheless were Tibetan Buddhists, just like the Khalkha.

The 18th-century wars to destroy the Dzungar polity and exterminate or scatter its people occurred with the assent and aid of the Khalkha Mongols, who were ethnically close and religiously identical. Some of the Dzungar even fled westward, to joint co-ethnics under Russian rule in the [Kalmyk Khanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmyk_Khanate). The region of Xinjiang that today is labeled “Dzungaria” had very few Mongols after the wars against the Dzungars. Nor did it have many people who we today would call Uygurs. Rather, post-genocide Dzungaria was occupied by nominally Muslim Kazakh and Kirghiz people, while today it has become a magnet for Han and Hui people as Urumqi has become Central Asia’s largest city.

Why am I reviewing all of this? **To show how complicated the idea of alliances and affinities based on civilizational identity can be**. The reality is that religion and ethnic identity do matter somewhat, but on the medium-scale, they are not as important informatively as on the extremes. Obviously traditionally ethnoreligious groups exhibited ingroup affinity. Buddhist Mongols lived with Buddhist Mongols. Muslim Mongols often assimilated to becoming Turks, while Mongol tribes which had experimented with Islam but eventually became Buddhist lost their Islamic connections. And, on the largest temporal scales and on the margin broader ethnoreligious affiliations matter. Buddhists from as far away as Japan protested to the Taliban when they were mooting the idea of destroying the Bamiyan Buddhas. Christians focus on the persecution of Christians in China. The Mongols, Oirat and Khalkha, became heavily involved in Tibetan politics after their conversion.

Details matter.

About six months ago I said something about the Kali Yuga on Twitter in a joking manner, and someone responded: “isn’t that an alt-right meme.” Well, it turns out that some alt-right people are Evola-loving pagans, though I doubt most are. But the idea of the Kali Yuga kind of predates the alt-right in the Hindu tradition, though a lot of people don’t know anything about Hinduism. Similarly, many Indian Hindus (religious or not) have weird perceptions of the origin of any ideas that are also found in Islam…and my name does not help in the way they reflexively respond when I express ideas that might be found in Islam.

But the reality is that it is hard to tease apart Indian culture today from the various influences that domination by Muslims left, even if said Indians are self-consciously anti-Muslim. This is to many people somewhat offensive. I think a good analogy might be some conservative white Americans who don’t want to admit that for many decades white supremacy was considered part and parcel of American patriotism, and constitutive to American nationalism. That arguably has long-term impacts, though unlike many on the Left I do not think that it is an all-pervasive miasma which touches every aspect of American life in 2018.

Not much in the report is surprising.

Here is a surprise to me though: **New Age beliefs are more common among the orthodox Christian/religious groups than among the secular subset that is dominated by atheists and agnostics**.

There are some interesting distinctions between the “Religion Resisters” and “Solidly Secular.” The latter is 65% male, while the former is majority female. The latter is more educated, wealthier, and more likely to be concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, while the former is more often in the West. The “Solidly Secular” are the type of people who would be New Atheists. The “Religion Resisters” are actually somewhat more liberal socially and politically issues than the “Solidly Secular.”

Another [Pew report](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/u-s-adults-are-more-religious-than-western-europeans/) suggests that Americans with no religious affiliation have nearly as many Christian beliefs as Europeans who say they are Christian. This is not because those with no religious affiliation in the USA are very Christian. Rather, it’s because European “Christians” are a lot less orthodox than you might expect.

[The Next Financial Crisis Lurks Underground Fueled by debt and years of easy credit, America’s energy boom is on shaky footing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/the-next-financial-crisis-lurks-underground.html). Basically, the argument is that the fracking boom, which has driven American fossil fuel supply to the point where we now surpass Saudi Arabia, is an artifact cheap credit pumping money into the system.

Fracking isn’t profitable at current oil prices. I think the author is probably a little too pessimistic, because technology does get better, and increased crude oil prices will probably show up at some point to fuel further investment.

That being said, how are books like Confronting Collapse maintaining such [high Amazon star rankings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005GLMATM/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=CNK7aJe5h-MHkKyO-RcD.A&slotNum=0&imprToken=Jq8d5if2Gritxc0D.HmJ7g&slotNum=47&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)? Is it a fraud? Or do these sorts of pessimistic tomes just always sell well?

Obviously, I can still jump chapters, but the reality is that I don’t do it much. Is it just me?

This claim is important: “Polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence are the most powerful predictors in the behavioural sciences and exceed predictions that can be made from parental phenotypes such as educational attainment and occupational status.” I’m assuming this is the sort of stuff in Robert Plomin’s new book, [Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CV4NPJC/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=kkaPNtn1iZyX1sVDRvQFpA&slotNum=50&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

[Numbers did not add up in the passport revocation story](https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/1041714890510139392). Unfortunately, this is a pattern in the media.

[Genomic history of the Sardinian population](https://t.co/psjofPxvIJ). As Spencer and I alluded to on last week’s episode of [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2), L. L. Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues did a really good job in their sampling. “Low effective migration rates separate these provinces from a broad area that extends to the mountainous Gennargentu massif region, including inland Ogliastra to the west. The Gennargentu region is also where some of the Sardinian individuals in the HGDP originate (A. Piazza, personal communication). We find that the HGDP Sardinian individuals partially overlap with our dataset and include a subset that clusters near the Ogliastra subpopulation.” **That is, the HGDP Sardinians are among the more “EEF” Sardinians.**

[A Game of Thrones: The Graphic Novel](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007LB5MF4/geneexpressio-20) is on sale for Kindle. I don’t even know if I’d want to read a novel in graphic form. But then I’m not a very visual person. Some of the original books actually had a few illustrations. But not that many.

[Eight Decades of Ethnic Dilemmas: Iconic sociologist Nathan Glazer on the problems of group identity, affirmative action and Donald Trump.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eight-decades-of-ethnic-dilemmas-1536962839) It’s incredible to me that Nathan Glazer is still around and intellectually active. To a great extent I’m sympathetic to many of the views he expresses in this article. He’s in the same class as Thomas Sowell for me, though to be entirely frank Sowell has gotten a little too predictably partisan with age for my taste.

Podcast with Alice Dreger. One of the co-hosts seems to have disappeared for most of the podcast. I assume he was just drinking beer. The last third where Dreger talks about journalism is probably the most novel.

Also, Dreger admits that she probably would have defended Bret Weinstein and Heather Heyer with vigor if she had not been so exhausted and drained by her own academic controversy, as she was forced out of her Northwestern position.

I will add on a personal note that I feel some fatigue and exhaustion because many of my friends in academia expect me to “speak up” about topics that are too politically sensitive for them to broach. I’m OK with doing that…but I have my limits, and other peoples’ third rails are not the burning passion of my life.

To be frank, I’m pretty skeptical about the future of the republic of letters and intellectual life in the West. At least in public. The liberal moment is probably passing. If you have opinions you want to spread, then try to convince those with power. They will make people agree with you.

By the way, the consistently shared drift between Basques and Sardinians, especially highland Sardinians, should make us lean toward the non-Indo-European hypothesis for [Paleo-Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Sardinian_language#Pre-Indo-European_hypothesis).
