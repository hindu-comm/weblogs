Sequence them all and let God sort it out!

That is, **to some extent this is an area of science where technology and economics are just as important as science in driving progress**.

I remember back in graduate school that people were talking about sequencing hundreds of vertebrates. But even in the few years since then, the landscape has shifted. I’m so little a biologist that I actually didn’t know there were ***only*** [\~66,000 vertebrate species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate#Number_of_extant_species)!

And yet this brings up a reasonable question from many scientists who came up in an era of more data scarcity: **what are the questions we’re trying to answer here?**

Science involves people. It’s not an abstraction. Throwing a whole lot of data out there does not mean that someone will be there to analyze it, or, that we’ll get interesting insights. To be frank, the original Human Genom Project project should probably tell us that, as its short-termbenefitswere clearly oversold.

In relation to how cheap data storage is and the declining price point of sequencing, I think my assertion that a genome, a sequence, **is not a depreciating asset still holds.** There is the initial cost of sequencing and assembling and the long term cost of storage, but these are small potatoes. The bigger considerationsare the salaries of scientific labor and the opportunity costs. Sequencing tens of thousands of genomes may not get us anywhere, but really we’re not going to lose*that*much.

Ultimately I side with those who believe that the existence of the data itself will change the landscape of possible questions being asked, and therefore generate novel science. But it’s pretty incredible to even be debating this issue in 2018 of sequencing all vertebrates. That’s something to reflect on.
