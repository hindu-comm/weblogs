*Salon* is [stiffing freelancers of \$150](https://twitter.com/DeidreLOlsen/status/1041768299317616641). I think this is more a commentary on the market for freelancers than *Salon*‘s always tenuous finances. The market-clearing price for a lot of web journalism/commentary is pretty low.*Salon* does this because it knows freelancers will tolerate and accept this behavior more often than not.

Of course **it’s really really light on the science of nutrition.** Or should I say “science”? Because the truth is that nutrition science has a lot of problems, so there is space to criticize it. But that being said, this piece is being shared by people who seem to think that there is a conspiracy make it seem like being obese is unhealthy. But most of the article is about how cruel people are to the obese, especially medical professionals. There’s really little evidence presented that being obese doesn’t cause issues with morbidity and mortality. Quotes like this are representative: “But individuals are not averages:[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040597/)have found that anywhere from **one-third to three-quarters** of people classified as obese are metabolically healthy.” That’s a huge interval. Why?

Ultimately the article should have been titled *Everyone Is Cruel to Obese People and That is Wrong and Ineffective*.

If you want some real nutrition science, [What I learned about weight loss from spending a day inside a metabolic chamber](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17486110/metabolism-diet-fast-weight-loss).

I bought [Early China: A Social and Cultural History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GA22L0E/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=u3owK4vZmARJcbdojrU2fg&slotNum=1&imprToken=Nm9TFYHEuxIMK7QKzhq.EA&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). A lot of archaeology. But that’s what you get! **I figure I should know more about Zhou China though**. I think next I’ll try to read up on Neo-Confucianism, a topic I’ve been lax in because of my leaning toward “[Han learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_learning).”

Most of the book does not deal with the Vietnam War. One curious thing I learned: the Vietnamese identity in the period around 0 AD was strong influenced by the influx of [Yue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue) people from southern China, as they imparted their culture and statecraft on the proto-Vietic populace. Of course on top of that came later Chinese migration, which resulted in the emergence of Vietnamese as a tonal language.

Though you’ll probably really wantPhở as you read the book….

Also, I knew this, but[Viet Nam](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06WV7FGWV/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=sfhENv2Ner0d1f7.liU1nA&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) makes it clear in all the gory details that the Austronesian Cham people of central and southern coastal Vietnam were undergoing the same shift to Islam from Hinduism that was occurring further south in the period after 1500. It seems rather clear that the emergence of a Cham sultanate on the model of Mataram or Johor never occurred because the Vietnamese conquered the Cham kingdom, and then assimilated or exterminated most of the natives. Many Cham fled to Cambodia, where they form the Muslim minority of that nation.

It seems entirely possible that if the Cham had retained their independence as a nationality one would have seen total Islamicization, as occurred among the Malays. As is this, this process was retarded by Vietnamese conquest, and so some Chams still remain Hindu (the same process applies to the Philippines, where the native population was influenced by Hinduism first, and was in the first stages of Islamicization, when the Spaniards conquered the archipelago).

Not as dense and informative as[Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06WV7FGWV/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=sfhENv2Ner0d1f7.liU1nA&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

[Change in sexual signaling traits outruns morphological divergence in a recent avian radiation across an ecological gradient](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/23/424770). Not a surprising result I guess.

This AJ+ video about [“white feminism”](https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/1042997097073725440) is getting a lot of attention. Mostly because AJ+ is backed and owned by a conservative Salafist regime which runs an oligarchic state on the backs of dark-skinned South Asian indentured labor. I’ve spent a week in Qatar at a really nice hotel. **I’ve never encountered service staff as solicitous and courteous in the United States**. At some point I may write about how certain organizations and institutions use political movements as instruments…but I always feel this is so obvious.

[Digging Into the Genetics of Drug Targets](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/09/12/digging-into-the-genetics-of-drug-targets). Derek Lowe, the science blogger who has been blogging for the longest time. This is why it’s worth reading him.

Next week on [The Insight](https://twitter.com/insitome/status/1043209578643644416) we’ll be talking about Indian genetics, again. Partly in anticipation of the ancient DNA paper, which should drop any day now (I have no inside information). Question suggestions welcome.

It’s a good value on a pound-for-pound basis….

[Individual selection leads to collective efficiency through coordination](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/21/422287). The last sentence of the abstract is key: “This finding reveals a general principle that could play a role in nature to smoothen the transition to efficient collective behaviors in all games with multiple equilibriums.” You need to figure out ways to get to cooperation.

[Late Pleistocene human genome suggests a local origin for the first farmers of central Anatolia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/20/422295). It seems within the Near East farming spread mostly through cultural diffusion. My suspicion is that that is due to the fact that it didn’t provide that huge of a demographic boost in its primitive form. Once the various farmer groups perfect their toolkit, they expanded into areas dominated by hunter-gatherers, not other farmers.

The [Austronesian expansion](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/1042850375898939393) actually makes me consider the possibility that we may never understand why the modern humans in the Near East \~55,000 years ago “broke out” and absorbed all the other hominin groups.

[Cornell Just Found Brian Wansink Guilty Of Scientific Misconduct And He Has Resigned](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-retired-cornell).
