Height differences across Europe could be less affected by selection than we had thought

So it’s no surprise he’s an author on one of two preprints which have rocked the genomics world:

[Reduced signal for polygenic adaptation of height in UK Biobank](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/25/354951):

> There is considerable variation in average height across European > populations, with individuals in the northwest being taller, on > average, than those in the southeast. During the past six years, a > series of papers reported that polygenic scores for height also show a > north to south gradient, and that this cline results from natural > selection. These polygenic analyses relied on external estimates of > SNP effects on height, taken from the GIANT consortium and from > smaller replication studies.

And…[Signals of polygenic adaptation on height have been overestimated due to uncorrected population structure in genome-wide association studies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/25/355057):

> Genetic predictions of height differ significantly among human > populations and these differences are too large to be explained by > random genetic drift.

I haven’t read both preprints through and through, but my first thought (along with others), is the same as Casey Brown:

Note that no one has responded to his question.

Finally, recall that population structure within Europe is relatively weak and the distances between the groups low. It reminds you of how difficult polygenic traits are to analyze due to the small and subtle effects, and how they might be overwhelemed even by subtle population structure. And recall, even the British population has some of that… (albeit, an order of magnitude or so less than what you can find across Europe).
