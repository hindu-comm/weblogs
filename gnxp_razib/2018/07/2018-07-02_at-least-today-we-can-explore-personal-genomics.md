At least today we can explore personal genomics

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C7S753I/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=51.Qr7Q6gcV0C5.zQng9Pg&slotNum=0&imprToken=V3dEYib3-p8TDiePBQZXrg&slotNum=18&imprToken=vAQP8LBKXG2BbzmAq9Ar8Q&slotNum=4&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55)A [very long piece](https://alcalde.texasexes.org/2018/06/how-did-dna-kits-become-so-popular-and-whats-next/) on the “personal genomics industry.” Lots of quotes from my boss [Spencer Wells](https://twitter.com/spwells), since he has been in the game so long.

The piece covers all the bases. I actually think some of the criticisms of direct-to-consumer genetics are on base. I just don’t think they’re insoluble problems, or problems so large that that should discourage the industry from growing. I think part of the problem is that many of the people journalists can talk to who can comment on the industry are based in academia, and academia has a different focus when it comes to comes to genetics than the nascent industry. For rational reasons academics need to be very careful when it comes to ethics. Consumer products I think are somewhat different.

But I do think we need to reflect how far we’ve come in 10 years. Back in the 2000s when I was reading stuff on Y, mtDNA and autosomal studies, I honestly didn’t imagine that I would know my own haplogroups and genome-wide ancestry decomposition. It seemed like science fiction. That all changed rather rapidly over a few years, and I purchased kits in the early years when the price was still high. Today it’s a mass industry, with a sub-\$100 price point in many cases.

Yes, there are plenty of cautions and worries we need to consider. But the future is already the present, and the horse has left the stable.
