Rule #34 for Elves

![Arwen Evenstar by Anna Kulisz](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Arwen_by_Anna_Kulisz-1.jpg?resize=200%2C349&ssl=1)

George R. R. Martin’s [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20) was striking in the mid-1990s when the first book debuted because it combined the epic aspect which suffused J. R. R. Tolkien’s work with a gritty realism in regards to sex and violence more appropriate for HBO.**So it was entirely unsurprising that Martin’s vision has translated reasonably well to HBO.**

This wouldn’t work as well with other epic series’ from the era. Robert Jordan’s [The Wheel of Time](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00VZIF6VO/geneexpressio-20) was certainly epic, but its characters were the sort entirely comprehensible to a twelve-year-oldboy.

Now that Amazon has confirmed that the new Tolkien series is going to be based around the early life of [Aragorn](https://culturedvultures.com/amazon-lord-rings/), some are highlighting what they see as a likely problem with the new series:

> While Game of Thrones is often held up as grittier and more cynical > than Lord of the Rings – often by people who see the latter as a > simplistic, morally two-tone tale of good vs. evil – the biggest > difference, when it comes down to it, **is the titties (and the > characters’ filthy fucking mouths).** Lord of the Rings is darker than > it’s often given credit for.

This, despite the fact that the exterior scenes in lush and green New Zealand did not properly reflect the ancient decay of the landscape of the fallen civilization to which Aragorn and his companions were the heirs to.

George R. R. Martin begins [A Game of Throne](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20)s in a brutal manner. Additionally, the perverted sex is frontloaded. HBO really didn’t have to do much to sensationalize the material that Martin gave them. In fact, I’ve stated many times that some characters, such asRamsay Bolton, were cleaned up quite a bit for the small screen. Not only is the actor who plays Bolton more handsome than the character described in the book, but he’s*less*depraved and cruel in comparison to the one Martin sketches out.

A scene where Arwen Evenstaris getting railed by Aragorn from behind would seem a bit out of character. And, the way Tolkien writes about them, I’m pretty sure that his elves did not have anuses, so the real kinky stuff is off the table.

But if the show neglects sex altogether, I suspect many adult watchers will perceive it as ajuvenile. In three films it was reasonable that due to time constraints the characters were depicted in a relatively chaste manner. But over five episodic seasons?
