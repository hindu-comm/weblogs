Carthage (and others) must be read

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/carthagemustbe.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/carthagemustbe.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004IYJEB0/geneexpressio-20/)The first half of Richard Miles’[Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004IYJEB0/geneexpressio-20/) is useful, but there’s less of a focus on the culmination you know is coming, the Punic Wars. For a history of that, I’d actually recommend Adrian Goldsworthy’s [The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265-146 BC](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GU3ASJ4/geneexpressio-20/) (one of the best descriptions of Cannae).

By utilizing archaeology and generating an inferred cultural history of Carthage, Miles does a great job contrasting the Punic mercantile republic with Rome. Aside from the penchant to name their leading citizens Hanno, Hannibal, and Hamilcar (to the point it’s hard to keep track of who is who), the most notable aspect of ancient Carthage seems to be its tendency to crucifygenerals who fail in battle. The Carthaginians come off as cartoon villains, even setting aside the child sacrifice. This is probably partly history being written by the winners, but it’s clear that still, Rome, in particular, was unique in its public spiritedness and social cohesion. This, despite the fact that Rome and Carthage had both converged on a system of an oligarchic republic during the height of their rivalry.

For China, I don’t know of a better treatment in survey form than John King Fairbank’s [classic](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006R4S9QU/geneexpressio-20/). I also have a very soft spot for Jaques Gernet’s [A History of Chinese Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521497817/geneexpressio-20/). Fairbank’s book is more narrative history with some cultural fat on the bones. Gernet is more a cultural history with an exoskeleton of narrative diplomatic history.

But I still really like Michael Grant’s big thick survey, [History of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684159864/geneexpressio-20/). I don’t know about Greece since I haven’t read Greek history much since I was a child. Though Grant has some books on Greece too.

It’s a little off the beaten path because it’s a history of Iran. It’s got only superficial coverage of the recent past and tries to go deep into the psyche of what makes Iran Iran. I think it is fair to say that the book ends of concluding that Iran, as we understand it today, is hard to detach from the Safavid period (when it become Shia).

I think these civilizations of the Eurasian oikoumene are good places to start to understand the human condition because so many people were peasants and those ruled by peasants over the past 10,000 years. I would recommend a book on India, but those are mostly religious books. Islam comes a little late, as does Northern Europe. Much of Eurasia and Africa had no written language. If you understand China, Persia, and Rome, you’ll understand a lot. And probably enough.

Book recommendations welcome.
