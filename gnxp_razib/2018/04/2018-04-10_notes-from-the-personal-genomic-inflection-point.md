Notes from the personal genomic inflection point

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C7S753I/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=2GFhD7RV9URCP4ZdChQUOw&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0060957557&linkCode=w61&imprToken=qGPmdDHXBuef34lpJEfhZw&slotNum=117)There’s a debate that periodically crops up online about the utility, viability, and morality of returning results from genetic tests to consumers. Consumers here means people like you or me. Pretty much everyone.

If you want to caricature two stylized camps, there are information maximalists who proclaim a utopia now, where people can find out so much about themselves through their genome. And then there are information elitists, who emphasize that the public can’t handle the truth. Or, more accurately, that throwing information without context and interpretation from someone who knows better is not just useless, it’s dangerous.

Of course, most people will stake out more nuanced complex positions. That’s not the point. Here is my bottom-line, which I’ve probably held since about \~2010:

1.  The value for most people in actionable information in
    direct-to-consumer genetics is probably not there *yet* when set
    against the cost. 2.  With the reduction in the cost of genotyping and sequencing, there’s
    no way that we have enough trained professionals to handle the
    surfeit of information. And there will really be no way in 10 years
    when a large proportion of the American population will be
    sequenced.

At some point, the cost will come down enough, and the science probably is strong enough, that direct-to-consumer genetics moves away from novelty and early adopters to the mass market. At that point, we need to be able to make the best use of that data. Genetic counselors, geneticists, and doctors all cost a fair amount of money and have a finite amount of labor supply to provide to the public. **They need to focus on serious, complex, and consequential cases.**

To some extent, we need to reduce much of interpretation in the personal genomics space to an information technology problem. For example, if someone’s genotype pulls out a bunch of statistically significant hits of interest the tool should *automatically* condition significance on that individual’s genetic background.

Yes, there are primitive forms of these sorts of tools out there already. But they’re not good enough. And that’s becausethere isn’t the market need. But there will be.
