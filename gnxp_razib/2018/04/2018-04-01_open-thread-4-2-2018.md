I talked to Antonio about this piece a few times. I didn’t have much to say with any insight. These tests aren’t ready for primetime because the prediction is pretty weak/worthless.

With a lot of this stuff **realized phenotype** is what matters. If I took a test and it said my predicted IQ was 90, or if I took an IQ test and it said that I was in the 15th percentile from the bottom, I wouldn’t reconsider whether I’m dumber than most people seem to think I am. I’d think that the tests were dumb.

Like genetic screening more generally this sort of stuff will become more important for newborns in the future because you don’t have a realized phenotype. Siblings different in intelligence. Some of this is random, but some of it surely dependent on genes. If children have different talents or competencies I suspect many parents will want to know as early as possible (my two oldest are young, but it’s already pretty obvious that my son is much stronger on visuospatial skills while my daughter has a better ability to abstract in a general sense).

[Ancient DNA tracks the mainland extinction and island survival of the Tasmanian devil](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13214#.WsDtjOZqnGo.twitter). The main issue I have with all these studies is the importance they put on climate. Climate changes. Often. That’s usually not a sufficient condition for extinction. People and the animals they bring around are.

That being said, I bought one for myself. Of course, I would! (I’m going to post a photo of me wearing it when I get)

A *Financial Times* story about the [Kalash](https://www.ft.com/content/0bf722c8-2b6b-11e8-97ec-4bd3494d5f14). I filled in some dumb surveys and it allowed me to read for free. It’s a pretty good story.

[When Gmail Launched On April 1, 2004, People Thought It Was A Joke](https://www.fastcompany.com/3028513/when-gmail-launched-on-april-1-2004-people-thought-it-was-a-joke). I’m starting to worry about our reliance on platforms. And that includes Gmail.

[How to Talk About ‘Race’ and Genetics](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/opinion/race-genetics.html). David Reich responds in*The New York Times*.

There has been a lot of talk on “science Twitter” about the David Reich situation. Some of it in public. And some of it in private DMs. I am heartened personally to see that most people are defending him because he does not deserve the patronizing abuse that’s being directed at him.

I am not much in touch with David, though we have met in person, and exchanged a few emails about his work. It’s not breaking any confidence for me to say that he did not write [Who We Are and How We Got Here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=W8wF8X2etDq616urFNULfA&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45) to become famous. The book will sell well, but it’s not written in a manner that will make him rich. In any case, among his peers, he is already quite famous after all. As he noted in the introduction to[Who We Are and How We Got Here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=W8wF8X2etDq616urFNULfA&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45) he wrote it to speak to those outside of the community of human population geneticists who read and write scientific papers.

Since David has such a high-status people within the community are very careful about what they say about him if they have strong criticisms. Not only is it hard to argue that he’s ignorant of the science (after all, he is one of the major producers of science!), but he’s a powerful figure embedded in a powerful institution.

I heard a rumor that there were actually a few genetic anthropologists willing to sign, but who didn’t agree with the final text and withdrew. And good for them, because this op-ed is a confused mess.

But, to be frank it’s entirely to be expected from a certain type of scholarship. Like many, I have expressed some concern and annoyance that geneticists engage in imperialism without consulting historians and archaeologists. But these are real disciplines with real facts and theories, whether those facts are undermined, and the theories shown to be false. **There is something real to be grasped at.** The Buzzfeed op-ed, in contrast, is by turns patronizing, incoherent, or just false.

The conversation has been bracing, but I’m not sure it’s moving toward any synthesis.

Complex traits are probably subject to Kurzweil’s [The Law of Accelerating Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil's_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns). Stuff is moves slow, then faster, and then we’re slammed against a new world before we can adjust.

Here’s a poll I created:

[Detecting signatures of positive selection along defined branches of a population tree using LSD](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msy053/4956645). The day will come when ancient DNA papers will start to slow down in their rate of release and I’ll have to catch up on the selection literature (though to be fair, there’s only so many real targets of selection we’ll pick up).

[Comparison of Genotypic and Phenotypic Correlations: Cheverud’s Conjecture in Humans](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/291062).

Back to reading [Enlightenment Now](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525427570/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0226684644&linkCode=w61&imprToken=eXmmDB26qzA853lOL5rU-A&slotNum=46).

Excited that the [AAPA](http://physanth.org/annual-meetings/annual-meeting-2018/) meeting is happening in a few weeks in Austin. Will be meeting up with a few people.
