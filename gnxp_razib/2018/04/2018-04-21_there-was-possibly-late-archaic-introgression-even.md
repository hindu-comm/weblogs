There were possibly late archaic introgression events in Eurasia

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cryptozoo.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cryptozoo.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684856026/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0716745305&linkCode=w61&imprToken=vYrSv9uK3G-.k.JhcKLrPA&slotNum=54)A few weeks ago [I posted on the strong likelihood that there were at least two Denisovan admixture](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/03/19/denisovans-neanderthals-yetis-oh-my/) events in Eurasia into modern humans. That’s probably the floor, not the ceiling. We have an Altai Denisovan genome, but the proportion is so low in most of South and Southeast Asia I don’t think we have a good grasp of how that component differs from the Oceanian fraction, which is much higher.

At the AAPA meeting last week I noticed something strange in one of the presentations: **introgressed Denisovan variants which were present among East Asian populations, but lacking elsewhere.** The fractions were not \>50%, but they were \>10%. The Denisovan variants were nearly absent outside of this core zone of East Asians.

There are two possible reasons for this distribution. One reason is that Denisovan variants were segregating in East Asians for thousands of years, and a common bottleneck, or, more likely selection, drove them up in frequency. Another, not exclusive, explanation is that **admixture occurred in East Asia relatively late**. The Denisovan signature is totally absent in the New World. Either that’s selection or drift eliminating variation, or, it’s the fact that this admixture event happened in East Asia less than about 30,000 years ago when Native American populations’ East Asian-like source population began to divergence from that of East Asians.

One thing that we know from paleontology is that species exist before the remains we find, and persist after the remains we find. It’s quite possible that small relic populations of Denisovans persisted for thousands of years after modern humans came to dominate the East Asian landscape.
