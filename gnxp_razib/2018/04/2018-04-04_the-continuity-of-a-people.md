The continuity of a people

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was no great loss. They were stone. Carved by man. That might be a Benthamite view. It would be a Salafi view.

But most people don’t think this way.

One of the themes of Toby Wilkinson’s [The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553384902/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=cZkITK5dwNOeFLp0CHiK8Q&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0691135894&linkCode=w61&imprToken=YsEWD8kvVA5-h0qfs5HYhw&slotNum=31) is that the temple institutions persisted over thousands of years. Even as dynasties turned over, the temples maintained a link to the past. Though many of their cultural characteristics were disappearing by the time of Ptolemies the Egyptians of this period still exhibited continuity with their ancestors. The hieroglyphicsystem actually was used down to 400 AD. The last inscription is dated to [394](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffito_of_Esmet-Akhom) at the temple of Philae. Philae continued in operation down to the 6th century, before it was closed by Justinian.[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plato_google.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plato_google.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307456722/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=yaJ-6Nt.lxTIazdHISwu8Q&slotNum=0&imprToken=-UdxRHxi3x6R6xHNbrmMyQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0582243025&linkCode=w61&imprToken=0-TZukoHTv4X9obi4hay.w&slotNum=172)

Other documents indicate knowledge of thehieroglyphic system into the 5th centuryAD. But the destruction of the old temples, the old customary religion, was the death of the old history and identity.

The Chinese continuity is striking because it is true that down the last years of Imperial China in the early 20th century the literati could access the entire corpus of Chinese though back 2,000 years. Dynasties fell, but unlike the West, there was no rupture with antiquity.

The case of India is interesting because I would argue Hindu Indians have maintained continuity with the civilization of India as it had matured in the centuries around the invasion of Alexander the Great. The Brahmins have maintained Vedic texts and the Sanskrit language. Those from the Abrahamic traditions sometimes contemptuously refer to Hinduism as “pagan,” but there is some truth in this, insofar as the religion grew and accrued itself organically from the native cultural traditions.

Today China is promoting “Confucius Institutes” as part of its “soft power.” Chinese who lived in the late 1960s would find this very strange, as they had abolished Confucius and were overturned the culture, the civilization, of China. But such tumult is not sustainable. I wonder if we are going through the same thing in the West. If so, perhaps we too will be promoting Plato institutes a generation from now?
