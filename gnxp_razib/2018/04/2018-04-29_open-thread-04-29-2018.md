[Matthew Hahn](http://www.indiana.edu/~hahnlab/) has a new book out, [Molecular Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878939652/geneexpressio-20). If there is one single reason I keep blogging, it’s to get awareness of the field of population genetics to spread beyond the small circle who are “in the know.” I joked on Twitter that buying this textbook is like spending money to talk to Matt about pop-gen, and that’s surely worth it.

Another one for the stack!

Not done, and I’m not sure it’s better than [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20). Perhaps my issue is that exogenous shocks are to be expected in my view of the world. Though the details in [The Fate of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071SLPWVL/geneexpressio-20) are novel, the general thesis and framework were what I’d assumed were taken for granted.

[What Happens When Geneticists Talk Sloppily About Race](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/reich-genetics-racism/558818/). I don’t think that David Reich was sloppy…though the op-ed was edited in a way that was confusing. That being said I’ve heard through the grapevine that some prominent human population geneticists may write a response to David’s op-ed, which is something I want to see. Part of me still thinks that these vigorous **public** discussions are important (another part of me just thinks that when Sulla or Marius take over all this old-fashioned fixation on truth will be irrelevant).

One thing stated in the piece above is that regular people have a Platonic model of race. This is true. But it is also a fact that geneticists have not done a good job of explaining to the educated public what population structure is, and why it’s not trivial or arbitrary. I know this from personal experience over 15 years interacting with people about genetics online (some of the funniest interactions are on Facebook where a person of professional class background/status “genetics-splains” me about how I don’t understand the extent \[lack\] of human geneticvariation and how arbitrary population cluster identity is).

There will be lots of detailedelaborations of how/what happened, but I think the big picture is nailed down.

That being said some of the objections remind me a lot of Creationist tendencies. Creationists often focus on weak points and hammer in on them over and over.

One of the weird things about Indian genetics is that a lot of people think new research will overturn Hindu nationalism. But I know several Hindu nationalists, and privately they tell me that most Hindu nationalists don’t care about these abstruse issues, and many of the more intellectual ones don’t have a major problem with the science.

We skipped a week, but we’ll be back. Taking some feedback in relation to various aspects of the show. A common issue seems to be that my voice is too quiet though Spencer’s is “just right.”

Again, if you use [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) please remember to give us positive reviews and 5-stars!

If you have ideas for shows, we’re game.
