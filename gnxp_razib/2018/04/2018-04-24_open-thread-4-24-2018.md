To be honest I was pleasantly surprised that the narrative wasn’t overly fixated on the ‘perversions.’ Sometimes it’s hard to move past that.

I think different people will benefit from reading the book differently. If you are a layperson a serial reading from front to back is optimal. [She Has Her Mother’s Laugh](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101984597/geneexpressio-20) is a long book, so this will take a while. But you need to do this to get situated. If you are a geneticist, you may benefit from jumping around chapters, and sampling what people in other fields are doing. Additionally, some geneticists would actually benefit from reading the historical chapters.

Yes, it’s very good. Will see if it’s better than [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20) after I’ve finished.

Thanks for whoever reviewed the [podcast](http://insitome.libsyn.com/website) I cohost on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) and [Sticher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight). If you haven’t done so, please do so!

Appreciate the feedback so far.

Found out today that *India Today* posted my [review](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/up-front/story/20180416-who-we-are-and-how-we-got-here-book-david-reich-dna-paleogenetics-1206274-2018-04-05) of [Who We Are](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20) a few weeks ago! Pretty funny I didn’t see it.

Meanwhile, [The Genetic History of Indians: Are We What We Think We Are?](http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/science/the-genetic-history-of-indians-are-we-what-we-think-we-are) It looks like Indian scientists are bending before reality: ““How do I say it? See, I am a nationalist,” Rai says over the phone. “People will be upset. But that’s how it is. All the studies are showing that people came here from elsewhere.”

If you need a gentle introduction, [Population Genetics: A Concise Guide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801880092/geneexpressio-20) is probably that. But I read [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) in 2004 without any formal training in the field. It’s not that difficult if you put time into it.

[Supervised machine learning reveals introgressed loci in the genomes of Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007341). Gotta do it on flies first!

[California, Coffee and Cancer: One of These Doesn’t Belong](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/upshot/california-coffee-and-cancer-one-of-these-doesnt-belong.html). The cancer warnings in California are treated as a joke by the population. Unfortunately, there are real carcinogens out there.
