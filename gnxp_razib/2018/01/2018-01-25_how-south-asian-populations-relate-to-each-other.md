How South Asian populations relate to each other

The radial plot above is a neighbor-joining tree visualized from pairwise Fst statistics (basically a proxy for genetic distance).

I also used Treemix to generate a plot. You see the similar patterns as the one above, though the two methods are different. Treemix tests a bunch of models and sees how the data fit those models. The visualization ofFst is just a way of representing the summary statistic.

Not sure if they add anything, but you can see that some of the nodes move around because they are so mixed.
