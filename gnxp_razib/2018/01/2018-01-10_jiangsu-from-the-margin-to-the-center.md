Jiangsu, from the margin to the center

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jiangsu-1.jpg?resize=200%2C159&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jiangsu-1.jpg?resize=200%2C159&ssl=1)When I was eight years old I memorized all the capitals in the world…because (well, because a friend had done the same). I’ve always been into geography. But there is one thing I’ve been guilty about for nearly twenty years: **I can’t point to all the provinces of China on a map and name them.** For example, I only scored 83% in 2 minutes 10 seconds on [Seterra’s China province quiz](%20https://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3206). For comparison, on the [African countries quiz](https://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3163) I got 100% in 1 minute 59 seconds. Obviously the latter is “harder” than the former, so it indicates my lack of focus.

To make up for my lack of fluency, I’m going to be reading Wikipedia entries of Chinese provinces and putting my reflections into this space. Readers who know more can also chime in in the comments.

The coastal province north of Shanghai, it is not surprising that this is a wealthy region in a Chinese context. Shanghai is administrativelydistinct, but it seems that it’s core “native” culture is really that of southern Jiangsu. Even without Shanghai in the mix, Jiangsu would have about the 14th largest economy in the world if it was a separate and distinct nation.

Since I read Kenneth Pomeranz’s [The Great Divergence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691090106/geneexpressio-20) about ten years ago I was not surprised at the fact Jiangsu was so economically vital. It had been the same in the 18th century when the lower Yangzi region became the heartland of Chinese economic growth and industry. But it seems that this region’s importance in trade and Smithian growth dates back at least to the Song dynasty, as the [Grand Canal](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691090106/geneexpressio-20) betweennorth and south constructed during the Sui-Tang triggered development.

Originally Jiangsu was not part of China proper, as during antiquity it was inhabited by barbarian peoples. Of course, eventually, it was Sinicized, and when non-Chinese groups took over the North China plain Jiangsu and the [Huai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_River) riverserved as a barrier to further southward expansion.
