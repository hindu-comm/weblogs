The duty to kill your friend

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/red_branch.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/red_branch.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080410591X/geneexpressio-20)In the late 1980s Morgan Llwellyn wrote a [novelization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080410591X/geneexpressio-20) of the legends of Cu Chulainn, [Red Branch](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080410591X/geneexpressio-20).

One of the most dramatic passages involves the fight between Cu Chulainn and Ferdiad mac Daman. In the end Cu Chulainn kills Ferdiad (in a rather underhanded manner), because they were champions who represented rival tribal confederacies in Iron Age Ireland. **But it was poignant in part because they were also very good friends.**

Most of you do not know me personally, obviously. But those of you who do know me from undergraduate years (and a few of those do read this blog!) also know that one of my closest friends from that time is now a Gender Studies professor at a major research university. We stopped being as close when she went to do her study abroad and we sort of drifted apart, but we are still friends on Facebook, and despite our sharp divergences on social and political issues I can’t exactly deny and negate the history that we had. That’s part of who both of us are today.

And yet we both implicitly know we’re on opposite sides in the culture war. And that’s fine by me. Not everything is political. And even if you have to do your duty in the end and stand with your own tribe when the rubber hits the road, you don’t need to deny the humanity in others.
