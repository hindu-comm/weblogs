Why Confucianism matters

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/short_intro_confucianism.jpeg?resize=179%2C281&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/short_intro_confucianism.jpeg?resize=179%2C281&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195398912/geneexpressio-20)Human nature has not changed, within some broad parameters, across history. When I first became interested in topics such as ancient philosophy twenty years ago **I recall being struck by the contemporary relevance of thinkers such as Aristotle.** Previously my focus has been on the natural sciences, where the dead were just names, whose ideas had often been superseded and extended.

And yet when it came to ethics and moral living the philosophers and religious thinkers who flourished 2,000 years ago seem to have arrived at the primary issues at the general level, though progress and change occurred on the details (and continues to occur).

Why look to China? After all, there were ethical systems in the West. First, I’m not sure that the supernaturalistic religions work to bind elites together anymore due to lack of credibility. Christianity is getting weaker. My own personal hunch is that the current wave of Islamic assertiveness and violence is the paroxysm of a civilization confronting its irrelevance.

Second, Classical Antiquity had plenty of ethical systems, especially during the Hellenistic and Roman period. But Rome collapsed. There was a great rupture between antiquity and the medieval period. In contrast, the Confucian and Neo-Confucian system persisted down to the early 20th century in classical form and casts a strong shadow over East Asia even today. While Stoicism had personal relevance, Confucianism was designed to scale from the individual all the way to the imperial state.

The 1960s saw a radical transition to notional social egalitarianism in the West. This is the world I grew up and matured in. Arguably, I believed in its rightness, inevitability, and eternal dominance, until very recently. But I think that today that model is fraying and people are looking to find some mooring. In particular, I think we are in need of a [rectification of names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_of_names). From Wikipedia:

> Confucius was asked what he would do if he was a governor. He said he > would “rectify the names” to make words correspond to reality. The > phrase has now become known as a doctrine of **feudal Confucian > designations and relationships**, behaving accordingly to ensure > social harmony. Without such accordance society would essentially > crumble and “undertakings would not be completed.”

How are we supposed to behave with each given person? A lot of this is free-form and improvisational today, and it turns out that many people are not comfortable with this. **Humans need scripts.**

Finally, the world that Confucianism developed was highly stratified, though there was some chance of advancement. It was not a calcified caste system, but it was a hierarchical one. I believe that is the system that we are moving toward in the West, and it seems that a system that takes for granted non-egalitarianism, such as Confucianism, may benefit us.
