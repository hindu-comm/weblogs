My top posts?

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cuneiform.jpeg?resize=301%2C167&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cuneiform.jpeg?resize=301%2C167&ssl=1)The fact that platforms tend to disappear has started to make me wonder: **what posts should I figure out a way to preserve for posterity?**

Do any long-time readers have opinions? I’m not talking popular posts necessarily even, that I can find through google analytics.

(note that I have my full archives on this site, so if you want to some for something that you vaguely remember that should be doable)
