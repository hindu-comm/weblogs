One thing though: **climate always changes.** It’s how organisms react to that change and why that is perhaps more informative. The way the Roman political order reacted the way it did to the exogenous environmental shocks had more to do with the nature of the Roman political order than the *sui generis* character of the shocks (they were going to happen….).

If you haven’t subscribed to my podcast with Spencer Wells, [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/website), you should (so far it’s on iTunes, Google Play and Stitcher). We’re coming out with episodes every week now. The next one will include Spencer’s recollections of the Paleolithic period of personal genomics, before 2005. We’re also recording a podcast with [Gencove’s](https://gencove.com/) Joe Pickrell on ancestry testing this week.

[DNA Geeks](https://dnageeks.com/search?q=GNXP&utm_source=gnxp_blog_post&utm_medium=open_thread) has more[Gene Expression](https://dnageeks.com/search?q=GNXP&utm_source=gnxp_blog_post&utm_medium=open_thread) themed gear now, including a redesigned [“Are you genotyped”](https://dnageeks.com/products/are-you-genotyped?utm_source=gnxp_blog_post&utm_medium=open_thread) shirt.

A new blog, [mtDNAwiki](http://mtdnawiki.com/).

Have not read. Though I anticipated the conclusion over 5 years ago.

I contribute regularly to the [Insitome Blog](https://blog.insito.me/). So, [No genetic test will tell you if you are Hispanic or Latino](https://blog.insito.me/no-genetic-test-will-tell-you-if-you-are-hispanic-or-latino-866d3fd38d05), was written after watching days of DNA-test reveals on YouTube. There’s a lotof education that needs to be done! As the [Regional Ancestry](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-regional-ancestry?utm_campaign=insitome-regional-ancestry&utm_content=blog-hispanic-vs-latino&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog) product rolls out results expect many more blog posts (and probably explainers in podcast/video format at some point).

The convergences between the racialist Right and the identity politics Left have always been sad. But now that both are the waxing it’s quite sinister. For example, both would agree that [science is Eurocentric](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/955181197335900160) in some deep way. And, both [pay close attention to marriages which are racially mixed](https://www.theroot.com/the-model-minority-is-not-a-myth-it-s-ajit-pai-1822165245) to draw broader lessons.
