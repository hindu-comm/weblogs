South Asian Genotype Project update

Just a quick update. I know I haven’t been responsive, but I’ve been traveling and spending time with the family and working a lot for the past few weeks. I’m going to make some revisions to my pipeline as well. **I will get back to generating results soon** (as in a week or so). So please keep sending data to [\[emailprotected\]](contactgnxp@gmail.com).
