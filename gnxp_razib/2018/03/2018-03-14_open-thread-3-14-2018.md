Ramez’s publisher sent me his book [More Than Human: Embracing the Promise of Biological Enhancement](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0557582334/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0195325419&linkCode=w61&imprToken=KSHkgwezmjtCY4A.Tbym0g&slotNum=33) in 2005. One thing led to another, and somehow he’s guest blogging on *Gene Expression*!

CRISPR as we know it did not exist in 2005. Things have really changed since then, and for the better, at least from the perspective of genetic engineering. It’s as if some of the stuff in[More Than Human](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0557582334/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0195325419&linkCode=w61&imprToken=KSHkgwezmjtCY4A.Tbym0g&slotNum=33)is coming to life.

Ramez is more optimistic about the future than I am, though cautiously so. I hope he’s right, and I’m wrong. I fear he’s not.

My concern is not with technological innovation. That will happen. It’s with maintaining social stability due to the immiseration of what was the middle class in developed societies. Also, the bourgeois version of the New Class seems to lack empathy toward the future *lumpen*….

[SEC Charges Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes With ‘Massive Fraud’](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-founder-ceo-sec-fraud-blood-test-investigation-settlement-sunny-balwani.html). “Fake it ’till you make it” will keep happening if there are no follow-up criminal charges. Holmes may not have gotten away the con, but she was a paper billionaire for a while and funded R & D with the cash that they raised on lies. One moral some are going to take away is that she took a big risk and failed, but it was one that perhaps needed to be taken.

I’m pretty bullish on a Democrat takeover of the house. The country will swing back. That being said, I’m also bullish on the idea that the Democrats are their own best enemy, and divisions and lack of coherency in their plan going forward will mean they won’t be able to capitalize on their electoral windfalls over the next few years.

I’ll be avoiding drunk people on the streets of Austin. But I also want to point out that my “side-hustle” [DNA Geeks](https://dnageeks.com/products/the-r1b-m222-haplotee?utm_source=open_thread_3_14_2018&utm_medium=dnageeks) has an [M222 t-shirt available](https://dnageeks.com/products/the-r1b-m222-haplotee?utm_source=open_thread_3_14_2018&utm_medium=dnageeks).

[‘Tomb Raider’: Fans Slam Criticism of Alicia Vikander’s Body](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tomb-raider-fans-slam-criticism-alicia-vikanders-body-movie-1094440). There are two points that I want to make. First, at 5’5 inches, Alicia Vikande is of a very normal height (Angelina Jolie was two inches taller). She’s not physically imposing, and she has a very narrow waist as well. Her figure is “boyish.” Second, since the 1990s there has been a shift in male action stars toward being more shredded/athletic as opposed to jacked-up and exaggerated in their physicality. This is a very different Lara Croft for a very different time.

Saw the book [The Invention of Humanity: Equality and Culture Differences in World History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674971965/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B00RTY0LPO&linkCode=w61&imprToken=RH8TIPnsC7U4cCROc.d0YA&slotNum=29). I hate the overuse of the term “invention” in book titles, but when I noted the beginning covered China, I got it. Too often books that are Eurocentric turn out to be more data than narrow/inference, and they rig the data ahead of time to support their thesis (see, [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674979885/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35)).

I also got [Constructing the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019960858X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35) (a David Chalmers book), [The Bible and Asia: From the Pre-Christian Era to the Postcolonial Age](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674049071/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35), [Creators, Conquerors, and Citizens: A History of Ancient Greece](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019023430X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35), [The Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1451651139/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35). That’s ranked in order of likelihood that I’ll get through them.

Also, Philip Jenkins has a new book, [Crucible of Faith: The Ancient Revolution That Made Our Modern Religious World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465096409/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QxNOFjkunbWsg-fLf7OtEA&slotNum=35). Jenkins is a great scholar, I admire his work a lot. But I think I’m going to take a break from religious history, since I know a fair amount about the topic.

[Polygenic scores and tea drinking](https://gcbias.org/2018/03/14/polygenic-scores-and-tea-drinking/).

[Exposing flaws in S-LDSC; reply to Gazal et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/13/280784). Working your way through this literature is often pretty useful, so start at this commentary.

*National Geographic* has a special on race and what not. One piece being shared is kind of interesting, [These Twins, One Black and One White, Will Make You Rethink Race](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/04/race-twins-black-white-biggs/). Here’s an important quote:

> In genetic terms, skin color “is not a binary trait” with only two > possibilities, Martin notes. “It’s a quantitative trait, and everyone > has some gradient on this spectrum.” >
> Historically, **when *humans* have drawn lines of identity—separating > *Us* from Them—they’ve often relied on skin color as a proxy for > race.** But the 21st-century understanding of human genetics tells us > that the whole idea of race is a human invention.

If you’ve read this blog you know I’ve blogged about “black and white twins” for over ten years. Also, I think a lot of the debunkings of race are pretty facile. But that’s not what I want to talk about. Rather, one of the things that are unmasked unwittingly in pieces such as this is how deeply Eurocentric these conversations are. **It’s as if public intellectuals and journalists that write on this topic either don’t know any non-white families or they pretend that they don’t.**The “humans” and “Us” implicitly points to white European systems of racial classification (e.g., East Asians relied on skin color somewhat, but since they are not much darker than white Europeans, they also included hair color, to distinguish the Dutch from the Portuguese, and large noses and body hair, to distinguish from themselves).

Twins with different skin tones are striking. **But almost any South Asian, black American, or Latino, or Southeast Asian, or even East Asian, can tell you that there is a wide range of pigmentation *within*many families.** Basically, unless you are in a homogeneous European social environment, where most everyone has very light skin on a global scale, you will see the variation of pigmentation within families. Both my parents have large sibling cohorts, and in both of them there are cases where the difference in complexion between siblings is in the same range as the two fraternal twins highlighted in the piece.

Of course, journalists who work for*National Geographic*or*The New York Times* know people of varied ethnicities and probably see that there is pigmentation variation within those families. They just pretend as if they don’t for these sorts of pieces which debunk race, and the readers pretend they don’t know this information as well as they take it in in a self-satisfied manner and nod sagely.

But those who say it’s quite like [The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143122010/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0060932902&linkCode=w61&imprToken=KTRnxLwRu1fUrkMO9tw04Q&slotNum=30) seem correct from how how far I’ve gotten.

My timeline has been swarming with debunkings of[Enlightenment Now](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525427570/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0060932902&linkCode=w61&imprToken=KTRnxLwRu1fUrkMO9tw04Q&slotNum=30) from all ideological angles. The best responses to these can usually be found in [Saloni’s](https://twitter.com/salonium) timeline (from her), who is “Pinker’s bulldog.”

[Ex-Muslim TV](https://twitter.com/ExMuslimTV/status/973386979218984960)‘s Twitter account is irritated that some of its stuff is now labeled “sensitive material.” The day before this came up I noted that one of my posts that Jerry Coyne retweeted about Islam and apostasy was also labeled “sensitive material.”

Basically if Muslims find it offensive, it might be subject to scrutiny from Twitter. This may or may not be defensible from Twitter’s perspective in a business sense, or ethically. But it’s just the reality we have to deal with, though I would like to know which school of Islamic jurisprudence Twitter relies on to gauge sensitivity and offense. I suspect it will be the Hanafi *fiqh* due to its liberal utilization of [qiyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas), which allow’s Del Harvey’s minions more free play.

The nation-state is dying. What will come out of its ashes? I suspect empire by another name….
