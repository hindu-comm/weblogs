The Nation of Islam has an antisemitism problem, and that’s about it

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/american_judaism-1.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/american_judaism-1.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030010197X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=030010197X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JZRWvh-ymIkyNx3jPO4IJg&slotNum=78)Currently, there is a mini-controversy of sorts related to antisemitism, Louis Farrakhan, and some organizers of the 2017 Women’s March. The main problem seems to be that these three co-chairs of the Women’s March, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez, and Tamika Mallory, are balking at denouncing their association with and tacit tolerance of Farrakhan. In particular, the focus is onTamika Mallory.

Personally, histrionic demands of denunciation usually leave me cold.

But in this case, there are strong grounds. **Louis Farrakhan and his small splinter sect, the Nation of Islam, have a long history of very extreme perspectives on Jews, and whites more generally.** The racism isn’t a minor idiosyncrasy with the Nation of Islam. It’s a constitutive part of their ideology. The Nation of Islam believes that [white people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam#Teachings_on_race) are a race of mutants designed by a malevolent black scientist. There are some similarities fundamentally with white nationalist [Christian Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Identity#Adamites_and_pre-Adamites), which dehumanizes non-whites in a literal manner. And, both the Nation of Islam and Christian Identity operationally share very similar and stereotypical views of Jews as evil puppet-masters.

In reaction to this much of the media has taken to writing long analyses. This piece in *The Atlantic*, [The Women’s March Has a Farrakhan Problem](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/womens-march/555122/), meanders over an enormous amount of territory. Frankly, it seemed a bit much.

First, **the co-chairs of the Women’s March are not the marchers themselves.** The marchers are to the Left of center, but many of them are quite moderate and mainstream and conventional. I know some personally who aren’t even very liberal and self-identify as centrists. And many are Jewish. The point is that leaders and organizers can have very different politics and associations from the movement they lead. Tamika Mallory has a problem. The Women’s March, not so much.

Second, there was a theme in *The Atlantic* piece about the fraught *and* cooperative relationship between blacks and Jews in the United States. Impressionistically there’s something to this, especially considering the Crown Heights riot. But part of me wonders if there really is such that much antisemitism among American blacks that’s out of the ordinary.

I binned the results into quartiles. You can see that black Americans are less warm toward Jews than white Americans, **but the difference is very marginal.**

Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam are clearly antisemitic by any definition. But black Americans are not particularly antisemitic at all. Farrakhan is as representative of black American attitudes toward Jews as those on the “Alt-Right” who obsess over the “JQ”.

To check I played around with a multiple regression.

Changing variables around I found three traits that were robustly predictive of warmer feelings toward Jews:

1\) The biggest effect was vocabulary score, which is correlated with general intelligence (r=0.7). If you don’t put this variable in, education matters. But once WORDSUM is in the equation the effect of education disappears.

2\) Being a woman.

3\) Being younger.

Being black as opposed to white is associated with being somewhat more antisemitic in many regressions, but it’s very weak as an association, and, it’s not statistically significant (this is probably due to sample size).

What’s the point of this post? Not to sound too much like Steven Pinker, **but there isn’t a looming threat of antisemitism in the United States from any large demographic.** Rather, there are small old groups like the Nation of Islam and white nationalists, which remain resolutely antisemitic. And, the Israel-Palestine issue does loom over campus politics in a way that blurs the line between being anti-Zionist and antisemitic. A small number of campus radicals and students from Muslim backgrounds do step pretty clearly from anti-Zionism to antisemitism in my opinion. In the latter case, it’s from personal knowledge, as when I was a graduate student a few kids approached me during controversies related to BDS from Islamic backgrounds expressing their strong reservations about Jews and taking courses from Jewish professors. These conversations were not welcome by me, but because of my physical appearance and name, they assumed I’d be sympathetic.

The problem here is simple, and it’s the indulgence that the black intelligentsia (that includes you President Obama) and some of the radical non-black Left, have given the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan for decades. Remember, he was on [Arsenio Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sljentVMg)‘s show in 1995. The issue isn’t the Women’s March (whose politics I somewhat disagree with), nor is it antisemitism in the black community. And most of the public doesn’t even know what BDS stands for.
