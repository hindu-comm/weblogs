Diving into Chinese philosophy

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ashorthistoryofchinesephilosophy.jpeg?resize=177%2C285&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ashorthistoryofchinesephilosophy.jpeg?resize=177%2C285&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684836343/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0143035908&linkCode=w61&imprToken=hzYhnnvcYXWw2ovxaBMUnQ&slotNum=127)Back when I was in college one of my roommates was taking a Chinese philosophy class for a general education requirement. A double major in mathematics and economics (he went on to get an economics Ph.D.) he found the lack of formal rigor in the field rather maddening. I thought this was fair, but I suggested to him that the this-worldyand often non-metaphysical orientation of much of Chinese philosophy made it less amenable to formal and logical analysis.

I recalled this when a friend of mine, from an Indian background, asked what I would recommend for him to learn a bit about Chinese philosophy. What I suggested was that he read [A Short History of Chinese Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684836343/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=l0P67slyY7QwBrAJFOdBlA&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45), and then read [The Analects](https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Chinese-Philosophy/dp/1420955055/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521704873&sr=1-1&keywords=history+chinese+philosophy) and something like [Confucius: And The World He Created](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046502551X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=l0P67slyY7QwBrAJFOdBlA&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45).

As someone who lives in the West from a Hindu background, I didnâ€™t think it was worth it for him to explore Chinese Buddhism, or even Neo-Confucianism, which emerged out of the reaction and accommodation with Buddhism.
