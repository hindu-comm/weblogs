Yellowbird ghost pepper sauce, 4.5 out of 5 stars

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yellow_bird_ghostpepper.jpg?resize=200%2C267&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yellow_bird_ghostpepper.jpg?resize=200%2C267&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XGPKCZY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0716745305&linkCode=w61&imprToken=CNdSty45EbNfeOoJZed-Rg&slotNum=10)Yellowbird is a small-batch artisanal hot sauce brand out of Austin, TX. I’ve talked some smack about their [habanero sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00TBFMXGE/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=081297381X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PtE7rXBauDAJ5P5k-mAyAA&slotNum=7) before.

Well, today I swung by the local hot sauce shop, as I was out of the spice, and needed some more. I chatted up the clerk and we were talking Yellowbird, how the serrano sauce tasted so good, and how the habanero one was second-rate. I asked him about the [ghost pepper variety](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XGPKCZY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=z.U7apar6GF9z0R0GxdArQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0716745305&linkCode=w61&imprToken=CNdSty45EbNfeOoJZed-Rg&slotNum=10), and he told me to try a sample. So I did. And I liked what I tasted!

This is not the spiciest sauce in the world. But very few non-extract hot sauces are killer. And, unlike extract sauces, [Yellowbird ghost pepper sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XGPKCZY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=z.U7apar6GF9z0R0GxdArQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0716745305&linkCode=w61&imprToken=CNdSty45EbNfeOoJZed-Rg&slotNum=10)doesn’t taste artificial or metallic. Real hot sauceshave complex flavors. Though not as spicy as something like [Dave’s Insanity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B078SSHHK3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=081297381X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PtE7rXBauDAJ5P5k-mAyAA&slotNum=7&th=1), this will leave most civilians sweating.

But there’s more than spice! [Yellowbird ghost pepper sauce](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XGPKCZY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=z.U7apar6GF9z0R0GxdArQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0716745305&linkCode=w61&imprToken=CNdSty45EbNfeOoJZed-Rg&slotNum=10)has a rich and nuanced flavor profile despite the powerful spice level, with a strong sour punch that hits you in the face before you even realize how hot it is. The savor is pretty flat from the beginning to end, but I tend to get a sweet kick at the end. I’m not a big fan of sweetness in hot sauces, but it isn’t pervasive and overwhelming and serves as a nice accent before you start to get the sweat on ascapsicum binds to your receptors.
