The 23andMe BRCA test

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23andme.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23andme.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ5K87Z/geneexpressio-20)In case you were sleeping under a rock, [23andMe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ5K87Z/geneexpressio-20) got FDA approval for DTC testing of markers related to BRCA risk. Obviously, this is a pretty big step, in principle.

But the short-term implications are not that earth-shaking.

From the FDA [release](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm599560.htm):

> The three BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary mutations detected by the test are > present in about 2 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish women, according to a > National Cancer Institute study, but rarely occur (0 percent to 0.1 > percent) in other ethnic populations. All individuals, whether they > are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent or not, may have other mutations in > BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, or other cancer-related gene mutations that are > not detected by this test. For this reason, a negative test result > could still mean that a person has an increased risk of cancer due to > gene mutations….

Apparently, women with one of these variants have a 45-85% chance of developing breast cancer by age 70. So the penetrance is high.

It seems that you’ll know if this sort of test is going to have utility for you based on family history.

The big thing is the transition to DTC. This will increase availability and drive the price down. That’s probably going to mean more work for those engaged in interpretation and education. False positives are going to start being a major thing….
