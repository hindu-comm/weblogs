The book is long, and review copies are in short supply. Would be nice if I could see it before it’s released at the end of May. Just use my contact [email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cdaea2a3b9acaeb9aaa3b5bd8daaa0aca4a1e3aea2a0) if you have a copy.

Pretty excited about it! The use of the word “heredity” is a clue to me that this is going to be a book with a really long historical narrative.

[How Genetics Is Changing Our Understanding of ‘Race’](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html). Everyone is talking about this David Reich op-ed in *The New York Times*. Well, at least in my corner of Twitter.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=175%2C264&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=175%2C264&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45)It’s adapted from a chapter of [Who We Are and How We Got Here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fDulYuyUQ6zTwMWmDYjWPA&slotNum=19&imprToken=dWwgZdarJqhovcdBcTXbCA&slotNum=5&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45). That chapter is both more subtle and more punchy than the op-ed. Anthropologists will probably dislike it even more than they dislike this op-ed because Reich does not pull punches (though contrary to the impression you might get from the op-ed he clearly prefers to use “ancestry” rather than the word “race”).

There’s not much to say about the op-ed.

I think it’s more interesting to perceive the dynamics of scientific culture at work in the reaction. The Reich lab is an eminent one, and its Diaspora includes other elite institutions now. He is affiliated with Harvard Medical School and the Broad.

Friends of mine who operate outside of human genetics characterize this subfield within genetics as one with sharp elbows and a mafia-like network of pedigree laboratories and superstar professors. It’s probably worse in theexplicitly biomedical area, but population geneticists who don’t work on humans still say human population geneticists are different (we’re talking *averages* here).

There were many criticisms of the op-ed from human population geneticists…but they were subdued, restrained, and often prefaced by praise for Reich’s scientific chops or his generosity as a collaborator. Both true of course. There was also praise.

**But the op-ed illustrated the reality of some unpalatable propositions.** In[Who We Are and How We Got Her](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fDulYuyUQ6zTwMWmDYjWPA&slotNum=19&imprToken=dWwgZdarJqhovcdBcTXbCA&slotNum=5&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45)David Reich himself makes it clear that some of the ideas he’s mooting are not palatable to him. If it wasn’t clear from the op-ed already.

It also illustrated a truth in academia from what little I’ve seen and experienced within it: **it is a highly feudal culture defined by patronage networks and an ordered understanding of the relationship of superiors to subordinates.** As they say: “You come at the king, you best not miss.”

This op-ed reminds me of nothing more than Symmachus’ [plea](http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/symmachus_plea.htm) for an old way that is fading before the new. Symmachus was rich and famous. He could dissent from the ascendant orthodoxy that was “passing on to better things.” But his class of the old pagan elite was at its dusk.

Most of the more vociferous criticisms of the 0p-ed are coming from anthropologists because it’s a different field with an alternative nobility of blood and status. David Reich can be thought of as an alien warlord who as trespassed the boundaries of their kingdom. But he is also aiming at the very foundations of their rule, so they can do no other but unleash the dogs of war.

Speaking of that book, my review is up at [National Review Online](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/03/book-review-david-reich-human-genes-reveal-history/). Hope to contribute more in the future to that publication! Doesn’t look like Kevin Williamson is getting fired from *The Atlanti*c, so there’s space in those pages.

I’ll probably talk more in a spoilerish way next week so that people who purchased the book can read it.

[Efficiently inferring the demographic history of many populations with allele count data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/23/287268) and [Recovering signals of ghost archaic admixture in the genomes of present-day Africans](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/21/285734). These deserve close readings.

I assume everyone on this blog has heard about my podcast and are sick of hearing about it. But there are still people who follow me on Twitter who haven’t.

Since nothing has changed in a while, [more positive reviews on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) and [Sticher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight), please.

**In a few days, I’ve going to have a post up on a new shirt which I pushed for at**[**DNAGeeks**](https://dnageeks.com/collections?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_3262018&utm_medium=dnageeks) (we got an artist to do something). But for now, check out the GNXP-helix themes [hats and beanies](https://dnageeks.com/collections/hat?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_3262018&utm_medium=dnageeks).

[The Battle of the Blue Cat Café How an anti-gentrification boycott became a proxy war between the radical left and the alt-right](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/the-battle-of-the-blue-cat-cafe/). Hits a little close to home.

The basic outline is that gentrification in East Austin is transforming lower class & lower-middle-class black and Latino neighborhoods into middle and upper-middle-class white neighborhoods. This makes some people really angry because they don’t want their neighborhood to change.

I’ve had some “interesting” discussions about this with locals with deeper roots. It’s fashionable to bemoan gentrification, but when I bring up my experience as an immigrant, and how that naturally results in change and transformation of neighborhoods, people get uncomfortable. **The emotions deployed against gentrification aren’t that different from the emotions used against immigration.** In many ways, the East Austinites who are being “displaced” can be psychologically analogized to middle and lower-middle-class Trump voters who feel they’re being “displaced.” Both groups *feel* they are being marginalized by people who are changing the world that their ancestors created with their own labor. And they probably are.

The free-market person in me says that gentrification has to happen, and the neighborhoods are going to change no matter what. But another part of me actually understands the argument by making an analogy to the national level: **too much migration into a polity can result in a transformation of its institutions and dispossession of its majority**. Pretty soon East Austin will mean something very different from what it has traditionally meant.

If you haven’t had wood ear salad, you haven’t lived. I highly recommend it as one of the major experiences of Sichuan cuisine (and of course don’t go to the place if their green beans are not recommended.
