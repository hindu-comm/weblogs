Also, updating a plugin broke the site, so I had to deactivate and reactive all the plugins. For whatever reason, the ‘related posts’ plugin also no longer works. Does anyone click those links? Might have to find a replacement.

[Models of archaic admixture and recent history from two-locus statistics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/07/489401).

Would appreciate subscriptions+reviews.

[America’s New Religions](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2018/12/andrew-sullivan-americas-new-religions.html). I dislike overuse of the term “religion.” And I’m generally skeptical of the idea of “political religion” as a useful term, as opposed just mass movement. But I think I”m coming around.

When it comes to religion, I take for granted that you’ve read a book like [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=rji8sv2CD1zc4Tl3VlqU5Q&slotNum=124). That being said, I do wonder about the psychological research used to support some of the conclusions in the field of the cognitive anthropology of religion in the wake of the “replication crisis.” Some of the stuff, like depictions of eyes making you more ethical don’t seem to be robust findings.

On [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) this week we talked [Game of Thrones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2). Yes, I do think meiotic drive is the best rational explanation for the persistence of Valyrian characteristics.

More data from the [Estonian Biocentre](http://evolbio.ut.ee/). Also, the title of a paper, “Multiple deeply divergent Denisovan ancestries in Papuans” which is clearly in review.

[Criticizing Islam is turned into “hate speech” on Facebook](https://secularright.org/SR/wordpress/criticizing-islam-is-turned-into-hate-speech-on-facebook/). The problem is that the “big platforms” like Twitter and Facebook are so big and diverse that it’s not that hard to “game them” and engage in speech policing. Facebook is really about family photos now. And Twitter is best done non-ironically if you have more than a trivial following.

[George R.R. Martin takes time off from not writing his book to laud New York pizza](https://thetakeout.com/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-new-york-pizza-1830881056).

[Why We Miss the WASPs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/opinion/george-bush-wasps.html). The reactions seem to be driven by people who were not clear what the narrow connotations of “WASP” originally was.

[Anti-Zionism Isn’t the Same as Anti-Semitism](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/rashida-tlaib-israel-antisemitism.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage). I pretty much agree, though operationally the lines between ‘anti-Zionism’ and ‘anti-Semitism’ bleed over pretty easily.
