The end of the year as we know it

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/download-3.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/download-3.jpeg?resize=150%2C84&ssl=1)Another one is almost in the bag. Lots of interesting stuff this year, though probably the most important story in “world-historical” terms, the genome-editing of babies in China, hasn’t really ended.

And 30% off everything with code [WELCOME2019](https://dnageeks.com/?utm_source=gnxp_side3&utm_medium=dnageeks).

I am playing around with [Member Pass](https://memberpress.com/) to create a leaky gated model for this website. Suggestions are welcome in the comments (I’ll say that I’m not going to gate archives).

I think 2019 will*finally*see the ancient India DNA. They can’t keep putting this off. My [review](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190107-early-indians-tony-joseph-review-1419016-2018-12-28) of the new Tony Joseph book is up at [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190107-early-indians-tony-joseph-review-1419016-2018-12-28) by the way.

I think we’ll see more “Golden State Killer” style stories. Well, actually, perhaps not…because it’s becoming so banal.

We won’t be able to predict what happens in the genomics space, because it’s moving so fast. But the stuff that David Mittelmann and I said in our [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1506-1) comment will really apply.

We’ll get more ancient DNA of course…but I don’t know what, as it seems Europe is tapped out.

The plot will keep thickening in “archaic hominin” land.

What are you looking forward to?
