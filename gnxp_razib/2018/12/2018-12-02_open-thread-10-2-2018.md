If you are ignorant, the [Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata) is about an epic poem that’s an order of magnitude longer than the [Iliad](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003ZDNZ1A/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=UMmTUFaf-MF7zefTCG-FhQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=t61TH5r9h2Jm6sMVbNyerg&slotNum=0&imprToken=amTx37Kn6DcyLIcdUhlmvA&slotNum=0&imprToken=AzgfUDs2bv2uQEsJ40Hx0g&slotNum=0&imprToken=nI2WcW-BmeFPRAFuSD4W7w&slotNum=0&imprToken=tD8XW2sLSv6f12lna0Hoyw&slotNum=0&imprToken=t9fzMS-D3IgC75NCvbxELw&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=1400032059&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PbhERoJIK5xi4ypDSzT-vA&slotNum=0) or [The Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003V8BN9K/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=UMmTUFaf-MF7zefTCG-FhQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=t61TH5r9h2Jm6sMVbNyerg&slotNum=0&imprToken=amTx37Kn6DcyLIcdUhlmvA&slotNum=0&imprToken=AzgfUDs2bv2uQEsJ40Hx0g&slotNum=0&imprToken=nI2WcW-BmeFPRAFuSD4W7w&slotNum=0&imprToken=tD8XW2sLSv6f12lna0Hoyw&slotNum=0&imprToken=t9fzMS-D3IgC75NCvbxELw&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=1400032059&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PbhERoJIK5xi4ypDSzT-vA&slotNum=0) combined. Menon’s prose rendering seems to get some good marks, so I that’s not why I chose it. It’s not the most artful writing, but that’s not what I was looking for, nor would I appreciate it in any case.

My rationale for reading this two-fold. First, as someone who was raised on [Bulfinch’s Mythology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07K616WFV/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B00ALWYMSI&linkCode=w61&imprToken=sX6h30Y4dVnzeiidjB688A&slotNum=4) and has read [Genesis](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009X5BVEW/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B00ALWYMSI&linkCode=w61&imprToken=sX6h30Y4dVnzeiidjB688A&slotNum=4) in dozens of translations, I thought it was behoove me to become a bit more culturally fluent about brown stuff. Especially in light of the fact that I’m “tagged” on a “Hindu Twitter” thread every few weeks now (12+ hard science disciplines apparently prove the Mahabharata happened 25,000 years ago!).

Second, **the age of Indian historical population genetics is coming to an end.** Perhaps ten years from now people will be doing temporal transects of eastern Maharashtra, but the bigger framework will be nailed down soon enough. And real intellectual understanding is going to have to synthesize archaeology and mythology with the demographic inferences.

There are some technical issues in this book you might pick up, as well as airbrushing out of [Eric Turkheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Turkheimer) citation. But I left that stuff out of the review since regular people won’t care or understand.

Plomin is definitely an enthusiast on some counts. But most of the book covers his career and views on behavior genetics.

[Why There Will Not Be a Beige Future: Skin Color, Genetics, Race and Racism](https://areomagazine.com/2018/11/28/why-there-will-not-be-a-beige-future-skin-color-genetics-race-and-racism/). Written for an audience less familiar with genetics. You shouldn’t need to read this. But some of you still don’t know what the breeder’s equation is.

[The New Evolution Deniers](https://quillette.com/2018/11/30/the-new-evolution-deniers/). I haven’t read this piece, but people keep asking me about it. Plenty of biologists have these sorts of views from what I can tell, but they’re never going to say a word.

So that’s why this battle is lost in my opinion. I don’t really care. American culture is now a battle between different groups of propagandists who manipulate the levers of power. The rest is commentary, and positivism and critical-rationalism are dead in the broader culture. They only persist in the “inner party” of the elect. Truth is the real conspiracy….

[The Harlot by the Side of the Road: Forbidden Tales of the Bible](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002PYFW02/geneexpressio-20/). Good book.

I’ve been defending Marc Lamont Hill’s right to speak and express his views, and retain his professional positions. Mostly because “free speech” really doesn’t matter unless you kind of detest the views you are defending…. So I guess I’ m still delusional and not a realist. I contain multitudes.

[Inside the chaos and corruption of Tripoli, where militias rule the streets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/01/inside-tripoli-chaos-corruption-militas-rule-streets). We violated the “Pottery Barn rule.”

[Ancient Yersinia pestis genomes from across Western Europe reveal early diversification during the First Pandemic (541-750)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/29/481226). Last author “Krause.” You’ll be seeing that a lot related to historical genomics from this group in the near future. Ancient DNA is cheap enough that it can be used to resolve historical questions as opposed to shedding light on prehistory.
