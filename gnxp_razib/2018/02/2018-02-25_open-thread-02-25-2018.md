Seems fine enough. Will say more when I get done.

I will say it’s strange to see how many people really hate the book (presumably without reading it?) and hate Steven Pinker. And curiously, it’s a pretty broad and ecumenical hate, from the respectable Left to the respectable Right. There is also more measured criticism on the merits from academics.

[Land of Promise](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061834815/geneexpressio-20/), by Michael Lind, is a book I’ve mentioned several times. It is broadly within the mainstream “big government Left.” But, I don’t think I’ve observed that it ended on a curious note. It used the term “chain migration” and argued for a shift toward skilled migration. Lind also asserts that low skill immigration pushes down wages of low skill Americans.

[Land of Promise](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061834815/geneexpressio-20/) came out in 2012. The 2008 financial crisis looms large. But we’ve moved a lot when it comes to immigration even since then… Not sure if the editors would let Lind leave that section in if he was writing today because it’s pretty much consonant with Donald Trump’s positions.

[The Inside Story Of How An Ivy League Food Scientist Turned Shoddy Data Into Viral Studies](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking?utm_term=.ocqjRVD2PZ#.bb78DbY4GJ). Another story from Buzzfeed on the Wansink story. Some assertions:

\* Brian Wansink is a “good person” by normal definitions.

\* His ultimate aim as a scholar is something most people would agree with. That is, he wants people to eat healthier.

\* Any single aspect of his behavior in this article, p-hacking, recycling papers to lower ranked journals, sloppiness, and trying to get the media to pay attention to his research, is not that exceptional. **It’s the magnitude and synergistic complementation.**

The Wansink affair is a really great illustration of the symptom. But the structural problems are still there.

Reading a bit of the [The Classical World: The Foundations of the West and the Enduring Legacy of Antiquity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B019G14YTQ/geneexpressio-20/). But really I think perhaps Robin Lane Fox’s [The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B77AEY2/geneexpressio-20/) does it better. But we’ll see.

Picked up Stephen Oppenheimer’s [Eden in the East: The Drowned Continent of Southeast Asia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0753806797/geneexpressio-20/). The thesis seems kind of crazy, but I’m curious and doing some research for a future podcast.

Tania gets a lot of space in Graeme Wood’s [The Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812988752/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691037116&linkCode=w61&imprToken=d8ZrXlqjthq7FdxEvwyjcg&slotNum=38), but she’s apparently writing her own book. I’m pretty curious, because Tania and I have a lot in common, but are also different in many ways. She grew up in a British Bangladeshi household, and one of the major things she mentions in the interview is how oppressively capricious and controlling her parents were. To be honest I related to this…but as a male, I’m sure my experience was much milder. Additionally, British Muslim communities are isolated and regressive in a way that American Muslim communities never are (in fact, outside of a few places like Hamtramck,Michigan, there aren’t American Muslim *communities* as such). That also comes through in what Tania says.

Spencer wrote a blog post today which is worth checking out, [R.I.P. Great Leap Forward](https://blog.insito.me/r-i-p-great-leap-forward-b666598a1050), which reflects his own historical progression and understanding on this topic. Our podcast with Chris Stringer should be up Wednesday night (so [subscribe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2)), and we touched on this somewhat (it was recorded before the paper landed, though Chris already knew about it). We’ll be talking to Milford Wolpoff this week, so we’ll see what he thinks.

One thing I want to mention offhand. Back in the 2000s, I had some online exchanges with [“Mencius Moldbug”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin). They weren’t exactly hostile, but ultimately I dismissed him because he got a lot of details wrong. And, to be honest, I was kind of annoyed by his stupid cultists who would leave comments. Moldbug himself was and is a smart guy, but some of his acolytes were not.

In 2018 I do have to say that I think that though Moldbug was wrong on a lot of details, and still is, **he had insight into something more general which I lacked.** My deep pessimism about bourgeois liberal democratic civilization and the state of intellectual culture draws from the same well that he drew from, though I disagree on a lot of the details to this day (I also now am much more open to radical Leftist critiques as well).

I bring this up partly because one of the things that convinced me to ignore Moldbug was his rejection of data which conflicted with his priors. For about 10 years it has been rather obvious to me looking at the literature and my own data analysis that **most ancestry in Southern Italy and Sicily does not derive from migration from the east which dates to Roman antiquity**.

The blogger at [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2018/02/bronze-age-sicilian-vs-modern-day.html)has posted the result from a Sicilian Bell Beaker individual. You can see that modern Sicilians are shifted away from the Bell Beaker Sicilian, who is more skewed toward the EEF cluster. But it’s pretty obvious that the shift has not been predominant. Modern Sicilians tend to have some ancestry which is certainly North African, and perhaps Greek. And the Sub-Saharan African in some individuals, which probably arrived during the Islamic period, is hard to miss. But most of their ancestry seems to date to before the Roman period.

And Sicily is the “best case” for predominant replacement in Italy.

I am a lumper, so I’m between two and three.

It’s kind of weird that people are explaining that there are “species concepts” to me in the comments. I thought answer 3 makes it pretty clear I’m aware of that.

I watched Black Panther. I liked it. It looks like it will make a lot of money. I wouldn’t be surprised if it results in copy-cat films. They probably won’t make a lot of money because they won’t be good films, and then Hollywood will go back to doing what it always did.

Tom Cruise is the new Dick Clark of our era.

Apparently, there isn’t a character for the word “problematic.” That’s good.

But I’m reading Judith Butler’s [Gender Troubles](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FBFG7G/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=Ta2KEqj0TZZuFjDKQoMaeQ&slotNum=32) soon. You might find that strange, but I’ve read Christian and Muslim apologetis too.
