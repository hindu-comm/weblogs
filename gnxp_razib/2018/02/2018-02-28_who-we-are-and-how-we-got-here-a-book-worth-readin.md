Who We Are and How We Got Here, a book worth reading

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PUW5C.BXxkUe4Wid3mF8Vg&slotNum=55)Yesterday I talked to a friend who has a review copy of [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PUW5C.BXxkUe4Wid3mF8Vg&slotNum=55). They gave me a preview (their overall assessment was positive).

I haven’t personally asked to get a copy because, to be honest, I thought there wouldn’t be anything new in it. If you “read the supplements” what more could there be in 368 pages? So I was waiting until the end of the month to buy the book and read it in my own sweet time as due diligence.

Well, this morning I asked a publicist to send me a copy. I will be getting it next week. The reason is that I’m told the latter portions of the book are quite challenging and candid as to what genetics may tell us in the 21st century.[Who We Are and How We Got Here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=PUW5C.BXxkUe4Wid3mF8Vg&slotNum=55)is a 21st-century revision and update of [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691029059&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZFfYd5ZkFO5ENXztvYql8Q&slotNum=221). But it’s apparently a lot more.

Also, I make a small cameo in the book, as does [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/) and [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/). I have always appreciated how the David Reich and Nick Patterson and their whole lab has taken people outside of the halls of the academy seriously. They didn’t need to as a matter of professional necessity but often engage as a matter of decency and seriousness.
