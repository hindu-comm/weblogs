[Land of Liberty](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061834815/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0804726302&linkCode=w61&imprToken=RZhraPhIIGtYOM4gnIFY4g&slotNum=10) in many ways was a historical foil of Stoller’s article, [How Democrats Killed Their Populist Soul](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul/504710/).

And yet both exhibit an intellectual honesty which I generally find lacking in the modern pundit class, agree or disagree.

Apparently this now one of Bill Gates’ [favorite books](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Enlightenment-Now).

I’m a big fan of Steven Pinker. But I’ve become much more pessimistic than him over the past few years. Here’s hoping that[Enlightenment Now](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073TJBYTB/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0804726302&linkCode=w61&imprToken=RZhraPhIIGtYOM4gnIFY4g&slotNum=10)turns that around.

Check it out.

I haven’t been saying this on the podcast yet, but you should be subscribing to it on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight), and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I7jprtnf55fbp6z77d24zfcmika), and review and rate it. Spencer and I have a certain audience already, and we’d like to expand it.

This has probably always been so, but I’m really getting tired by the emergence of different verbal ticks in various socio-political subcultures. For example, when liberals say “my dude” -“bros”, it’s dismissal-by-identity. Both NRx, and what is now called the Altright, also have their own subculture languages, which makes understanding what they’re trying to say hard for outsiders. A feature or a bug?

Taking a Twitter break for a week.
