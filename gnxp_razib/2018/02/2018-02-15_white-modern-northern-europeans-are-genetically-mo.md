White modern Northern Europeans are genetically more like brown South Asians than brown(ish) ancient Northern Europeans were

But there is a curious quirk here and it reveals something about human psychology: **modern Britons are genetically much closer to South Asians, like Arathi Prasad, than these ancient darker-skinned Britons.** The plot to the left illustrates this (it’s using the [Dystruct](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/07/261131) package). The far right of the top panels represent South Asians. You can see Europeans pretty clearly. Let’s note two things:

1\) Modern Europeans (except for Sardinians) share an orange “steppe” component with most South Asians (these are no doubt Indo-European migrations of the Bronze Age)

2\) The brown element represents European hunter-gatherers. This element is found at varying quantities across Europe, with the lowest fractions in Sardinians. Though present in South Asians (this may or may not be an artifact to be honest), it’s not present at very high frequencies.

One always has to be careful about taking these proportions as literal representations of ancestral populations. They are not.**But what they show is that modern Northern Europeans and South Asians have been touched by the same population movements over the past 5,000 years, and so are genetically much closer than the people who lived in Northern Europe and South Asia 5,000 years ago**.

In a pre-modern environment, physical cues were important for group identity, though I suspect just as much due to scarification and tattooing as phenotypic differences due to biology. The fact that Cheddar Man, and Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in Western Europe more generally, probably resembled modern South Asians more than they do modern Northern Europeans (I think they were more likely to be olive-brown than dark-brown, but I’m not confident), is more salient to human folk biology than the fact that modern Northern Europeans are much closer genetically to South Asians than the more “brown” ancient Northern Europeans.

Stuff like this always reminds me of the deep wisdom in Artur C. Clarke’s [Childhood’s End](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345347951/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=069111854X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=wwuc2PMIsXRBi9moXgS-Gw&slotNum=22). The ultimately benevolent alien species which mentored humanity shielded us from their physical appearance because the knew we’d find it horrifying. The substance of what they did for us, who they were, was going to be less important to immature humans than the fact of what they looked like.

**Note**: [Fst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_index#FST_in_humans) between Sindhi from Pakistan and WHG (Cheddar Man was one) is 0.087. Sindhi from Pakistan and English is 0.023. English to WHG is 0.058 ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048219/bin/NIHMS801601-supplement-ExtDataTable_3.pdf)). Fst**can not be naively interpreted as “genetic distance.”** But, this gets at the fact that Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers were very distant from modern South Asians. And widespread gene flow and admixture over the past 5,000 has compressed a lot of genetic differences which were starker across geography in the past.
