My prediction: Dems will take the House. But Republicans will make a gain of +1 in the Senate.

[Pakistan’s Hybrid Government and the Aasia Bibi Fiasco..](http://www.brownpundits.com/2018/11/02/pakistans-hybrid-government-and-the-aasia-bibi-fiasco/) Basically, reasonable people in Pakistan are terrified about being openly reasonable, lest the crazy minority kill them. Another thing is that the details of what this woman did is irrelevant now, she’s a symbol. We’ve seen this in the United States: feelings don’t care about your facts.

[DNA Sequencing Giant Illumina Will Buy Pacific Biosciences For \$1.2 Billion – Exclusive CEO Interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/11/01/dna-sequencing-giant-illumina-will-buy-pacific-biosciences-for-12-billion--exclusive-ceo-interview/). I think this is precautionary.

[Half of Americans believe in ghosts…](https://twitter.com/JoHenrich/status/1058820467723776000)

[Least-cost pathway models indicate northern human dispersal from Sunda to Sahul](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248418302136).

[Inferring the ancestry of everyone](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/01/458067). “We introduce an algorithm to infer whole-genome history which has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but can process around **four orders of magnitude** more sequences.”

[Genetic Consequences of Social Stratification in Great Britain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457515). This is obviously triggering discussion. But please note this preprint is the beginning of a conversation, not the closure on anything.

[Species limits in butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae): Reconciling classical taxonomy with the multispecies coalescent](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/29/451039).

Again, Tim Blanning’s [Frederick The Great](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B014NZGRW2/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0571223923&linkCode=w61&imprToken=IVYePVpod0h14EMSLN0K2A&slotNum=40) is interesting as both biography and history of 18th century Prussia. The book has the subtitle “King of Prussia,” but if Blanning was in it for the clicks, it would be “The Gay Atheist Autocrat.”
