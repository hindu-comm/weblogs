Going beyond WEIRD dichotomies-cultural anthropology with a genetical lens

> I entirely agree that the average quality of anthropological research, > especially of the cultural type, is kept extremely low by lack of > statistical knowledge and of hypothetical deductive methodology. At > the moment there is no indication that the majority of cultural > anthropologists accept science – the most vocal of them still choose > to deny that anthropology is science. They are certainly correct for > what regards most of their work.

But Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd learned the application of population and quantitative genetic modeling to cultural dynamics from Feldman in the 1980s. In their own turn, they trained researchers such as Joe Henrich.

Henrich in his turn helped train scholars such as [Michael Muthukrishna](http://michael.muthukrishna.com/). Here’s a preprint that has me really excited, [Beyond WEIRD Psychology – Measuring and Mapping Scales of Cultural and Psychological Distance](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3259613):

> We present a new tool that provides a means to measure the > psychological and cultural distance between two societies and create a > distance scale with any population as the point of comparison. Since > psychological data is dominated by samples drawn from the United > States or other WEIRD nations, this tool provides a “WEIRD scale” to > assist researchers in systematically extending the existing database > of psychological phenomena to more diverse and globally representative > samples. As the extreme WEIRDness of the literature begins to > dissolve, the tool will become more useful for designing, planning, > and justifying a wide range of comparative psychological projects. We > have made our code available and developed an online application for > creating other scales (including the “Sino scale” also presented in > this paper). We discuss regional diversity within nations showing the > relative homogeneity of the United States. Finally, we use these > scales to predict various psychological outcomes.

For the people who know genetics, **they have created a cultural analogy of Fst!!!**. From the preprint:

> Cultural F_(ST) (CF_(ST)) is calculated in the same manner as Genetic > F_(ST), but instead of a genome, we use a large survey of cultural > values as a “culturome”, **with questions treated as loci and answers > treated as alleles.**

I’m going to just present two figures without comment:
