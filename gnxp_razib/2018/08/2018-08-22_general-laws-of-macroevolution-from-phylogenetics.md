General laws of macroevolution from phylogenetics

A lot of the stuff is interesting, though over my head. In biology, I began with a fascination with natural history. What we might term macroevolution today. I was that kid carrying out [The Dinosaur Heresies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688042872/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0451529065&linkCode=w61&imprToken=NglwheU7P7-MHiepZyGmSg&slotNum=225) when I was nine. But aside from the specific, broad patterns of diversification and extinction over geological time periods were clear. Over the years I wended my way through biochemistry, molecular evolution, and finally population genetics. My professional interests, therefore, have generally focused on patterns of variation on a microevolutionary scale. Stuff*within*species, not *across* species.

But I’m still quite interested in big picture evolutionary processes. I’m not a fan of Stephen Jay Gould, but I did read the highly repetitive and prolix [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IVHCTOY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=Hycuzuq5guWsBHCGHckPHg&slotNum=0&imprToken=O1EAwP0UankxxrjFzIGLlA&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). And, I have a decent course background in phylogenetics because of where I studied (well, at least in Bayesian and ML computational methods and the big picture theory). So I followed very closely [the reports](https://twitter.com/fsantini2015/status/1031792143461965824) of [Luke Harmon’s](http://lukejharmon.github.io/) Presidential address at the meeting this year.

After the talk came the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/21/396598), [Macroevolutionary diversification rates show time-dependency](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/21/396598):

The major figure is at the top of the post. The authors tried to check if the pattern that they saw was a statistical artifact, and they don’t think it is. Rather, they believe that the pattern is a reflection of some genuine material or dynamic processes latent in the origin and extinction of species. They conclude that “This scenario, consistent \[with\] our results, would imply that the scaling of rates of sedimentation, phenotypic divergence, molecular evolution, and diversification with time all might share a common cause.” More concretely, earlier in the paper they note that the K-T boundary resulted in an extinction and speciation event (for dinosaurs and mammals respectively). But these massive catastrophic shocks don’t seem to happen regularly as much as randomly.

There’s a lot to chew on in the preprint. I can’t judge the technical details, which are in the supplements. For example, I have heard of [BAMM](http://bamm-project.org/introduction.html) before and know some of its general principles because of my coursework, but I’ve never done this sort of analysis extensively, and so I’ve never developed a good intuition about what passes the smell test and what doesn’t. But it strikes me that this field of phylogenetics is nevertheless very accessible to those who are non-scientists but genuinely interested in evolutionary biology. I recommend you read the preprint closely if you do aver an interest in this field.

**Addendum**: Note that I still think that evolution is [scale independent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11258392)on a deep level. Should I change my mind based on this? I don’t see why.
