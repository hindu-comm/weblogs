The coming genetic invasion of history, and the rage to come

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/saxonsvikingskings.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/saxonsvikingskings.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004I1KX0E/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=VdcOIiX2dlVvIXkGiO3Z3w&slotNum=39&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)About ten years ago I reviewed Bryan Sykes’ book [Saxons, Vikings, and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004I1KX0E/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=VdcOIiX2dlVvIXkGiO3Z3w&slotNum=39&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). It was what it was, **a product of the Y/mtDNA era.** Therefore, there were a fair amount of conclusions which in hindsight turn out to be wrong. Sykes, and other genetic historians, such as Stephen Oppenheimer, have annoyed historians for years with their genetic imperialism. More frequently, genetic research has been an accent or inflection on historical work. Peter Heather has integrated some genetic results in his earlier books, though you can ignore those and still obtain the general conclusions.

The [recent work on near antiquity](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/03/13/the-barbarian-invasions-illuminated-by-genetics/) is a hint that that is going to be blown apart. Ancient DNA in the **historical** period has been a slow simmer for a while now. The reason is simple: ancient DNA returns more on the investment for prehistory, where there aren’t historical documents. Until recently ancient DNA techniques were expensive in a variety of ways. The industrial process described in [Who We Are and How We Got There](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=KCgdT4PLKQQcnWj5ztZDsg&slotNum=39&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is going to change that.

You would think that testing hypotheses, generally with demographic predictions, would be something that historians would welcome. The problem is that the test will mean some scholars are going to turn out to be wrong. People who spent decades building up a particular model or understanding of the past are going to have that torn away from them.

The normal human reaction is to get defensive. But the problem is that many historians are not well trained in genetic methods. In fact, many geneticists are not well trained in the abstruse statistical methods developed by scholars in ancient DNA.

But archaeologists had models which were, to be frank, more speculative than those historians cling to. Even if a particular historical model may be wrong, it is likely there are reasonable grounds to have held onto to that position. If ancient DNA falsifies it the reaction will be even more strident I suspect.

Of course, geneticists need the help of historians. So when the bad feelings clear I think the synthesis will get us to a better understanding of the past.
