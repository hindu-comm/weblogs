Cave bears live on in brown bears, and were vegetarians (what!?!?!)

A sad thing about this publication is that brought to my attention that these ancient cave bears were mostly herbivores. It makes me view [The Clan of the Cave Bear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00466HQ2Y/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=k.X-CzAoNfZLLoV.rCFCIg&slotNum=0&imprToken=N4Lgw0AoqIqcKItQzl6z-g&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) differently!

I assume most readers of this weblog are not surprised. We know that various [extant and extinct members of the elephant lineage have mixed](http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/02/27/elephant-dna-mammoth). By a strange coincidence (or perhaps not?) the fraction of cave bear DNA in modern brown bears seems very similar to the fractions of Neanderthal DNA we seen in modern lineages. The authors infer that the gene flow may also have been bidirectional, so various bear lineages had multiple and complex interactions over hundreds of thousands of years. Something notable is that the divergence between cave and brown bears is considerably deeper than that between Neanderthals and modern humans. If the latter can be dated to*around*750,000 years ago, with large intervals on either side, the bears apparently separated into separate species 1.2 to 1.4 million years ago.

The greater time depth is of interest to the authors. From [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/science/cave-bears-dna-extinction.html):

The expectation here is conditional on the idea that bears which occupy different ecological niches probably won’t hybridize even if they overlap in range.

Big mammals tend to occupy a lot of territory, and different big mammal lineages overlap. It seems rather common for gene flow to occur between them. There is evidence of jackal and coyote introgression into Eurasian wolves, for example.

So I guess I’m not that surprised. And David Quammen’s new book, [The Tangled Tree](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075RX2QY4/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=DNg1cBWZwK2vtOkluIASiQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=GqkJYB5R0vMIGDdFkrTyeA&slotNum=48), presents a rather non-revolutionary message from where I stand. Though perhaps it hasn’t gotten out to the “public.” The complexity and multi-textured reality of the “species problem” is pretty clear to any biologist who work’s on population-level data.
