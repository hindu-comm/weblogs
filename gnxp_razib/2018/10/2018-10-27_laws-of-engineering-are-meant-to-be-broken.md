Laws of engineering are meant to be broken

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/greatestshowonearth.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/greatestshowonearth.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002LVVCQM/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=JScrVKty4iYyAiMdUrw7Ww&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)A [reader](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/10/24/the-crash-of-the-cost-of-genome-sequencing/comment-page-1/#comment-10802) pointed out a very interesting passage in Richard Dawkins’ [The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002LVVCQM/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=JScrVKty4iYyAiMdUrw7Ww&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) on the future possibilities of genome sequencing. Since the book was published in the middle of 2009, it is quite possible the passage was written in 2008, or even earlier.

Unfortunately for Dawkins’ prognostication track-record, but fortunately for science, he was writing at the worst time to make a prediction:

> …the doubling time \[data produced for a given fixed input\] is a bit > more than two years, where the Moore’s Law doubling time is a bit less > than two years. DNA technology is intensely dependent on computers, so > it’s a good guess that Hodgkin’s Law is at least partly dependent on > Moore’s Law.

![Obsolete plot from *The Greatest Show on Earth*](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hogkinslaw.jpg?resize=300%2C177&ssl=1)

The cost for a sequence here is somewhat fuzzy. The*first*assembly of a genome sequence of an organism is much more difficult than subsequent alignments of later organisms (though more in computation than in the sequencing). But, the upshot is that Dawkins was writing when “Hodgkin’s Law” was collapsing. From 2008 to 2011 Moore’s Law was destroyed by the [sequencing revolution](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/10/24/the-crash-of-the-cost-of-genome-sequencing/) pushed forward by Illumina.

Though you can get a \$1,000 consumer human sequence today, the reality is that this is for 30× coverage. For lower coverage, which means you aren’t as sure of the validity of any given variant, the price drops rapidly. And for the type of evolutionary questions Dawkins is interested in, the coverage needed is far lower than 30× (you probably want to get a larger number of samples than a single high-quality sample).
