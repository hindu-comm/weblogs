[Sex in humans may not be binary, but it’s surely bimodal](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/sex-in-humans-may-not-be-binary-but-its-surely-bimodal/). Jerry Coyne is a well known evolutionary biologist who is also a vocal atheist. He’s now emeritus from the University of Chicago, and so I feel he’s kind of “out of step” with the culture. For example, within this post, which I generally agree with, he uses the term “transsexual” when most academics would use “transgender” to mean what he means. A lot of biologists don’t comment on this issue for two reasons. First, it’s politically fraught and you can’t really win. Second, the terms, norms, and frameworks are changing fast and constantly, so that people don’t even know what they’re addressing.

Speaking of fraught, the first robust SNP hits for male nonheterosexual behavior were reported at ASHG. The preprint should be out in less than four months. Antonio Regalado has already reported on it, [Genes linked to being gay may help straight people get more sex](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611946/genes-linked-to-being-gay-may-help-straight-people-get-more-sex/). We plan to interview one of the authors on our [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2).

Recently talked to some people from [Andy Kern’s](http://kernlab.org/) lab about implications of Wright-Fisher vs. non-Wright-Fisher models in terms of spatial heterogeneity. It really makes me excited for the “forward simulation revolution.” Talking to people in evolutionary genomics that isn’t focused on getting NIH grants for human research, and it is clear why [Matt Hahn](https://twitter.com/3rdreviewer) has stated that there’s already enough data produced for many years to come.

I’m skeptical of the conclusion, but this post has a lot of interesting information. Additionally, I think that AASI ancestry is going to be found in the Indus Valley between 3000 and 2000 BC…but I’m not totally sure. Johanna Nichols’ work is recommended though.

[The Fifth Column podcast](https://player.fm/series/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition-2360215/ep-118-a-conversation-w-sarah-haider-identity-apostasy-and-islam) talks to Sarah Haider. In general, I’m a fan of the podcast.

Recently I’ve been thinking about China and Saudi Arabia. Recently we’re looking skeptically at our elite’s ties with [Saudi Arabia](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/20/659122586/saudi-arabias-deep-influence-in-the-u-s). But what about China? Many researchers and businesspeople “have” to work with China, and unlike Saudi Arabia, it seems implausible that we can “avoid” interactions. But there are plenty of human rights issues with the Chinese state. The only conclusion I draw is that people need to be careful about getting on their high horses. Researchers who criticize working with the Saudis or in Israel should also consider them working with Chinese colleagues who are under the purview of a problematic state…but that penalize their Chinese colleagues, and would be harder and harder to maintain over the years.

The media and the mainstream institutions basically colluded to create a narrative more politically convenient. Are we surprised?

The Blanning Frederick the Great [book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400068126/geneexpressio-20/) really is good. Though some of you might want to speed through the details of campaigns (and some of you may not).
