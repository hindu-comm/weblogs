Postcolonial imperialism

But the general thesis and the review of the literary works seems moderately coherent actually. Far less of a screed than the more recent distillations. Who says evolution ascends upward in complexity?

As someone who isn’t well versed in literature I can’t really comment on the validity of the interpretations, but, there is one thing that I noticed in Said’s argument which prefigures modern postcolonialism: **it abstracts and generalizes from a particular instance in human history, European interactions with non-Europeans in the early modern and modern period, and projects them across all of history**. Like tachyons going back in time the manipulations and predations of early modern Europeans echo back through time and forward into infinite.

Here is a representativesample of what I’m talking about. The first section is a quote fromAeschylus:

> *Now all **Asia’s** land  
> Moans in emptiness.  
> Xerxes led forth, oh oh!  
> Xerxes destroyed, woe woe!  
> Xerxes’ plans have all miscarried  
> In ships of the sea.  
> Why did Darius then  
> Bring no harm to his men  
> When he led them into battle,  
> That beloved leader of men from Susa?  
> *  
> What matters here is that **Asia speaks through and by virtue of the > European imagination**, which is depicted as victorious over Asia, > that hostile “other” world beyond the seas….

In part, the idea of a decadent civilization and the decline from more vigorous ages is a common theme in the ancient world, and the Romans in their turn depicted the Greeks as the Greeks had depicted the Persians.

And, of course, the context here is that *some* people of Hellas were resisting the domination and expansion of the world’s greatest empire of the time, that of the Persians, which was based in Asia.Aeschylus was a bard of the subaltern in this context! The whole passage when exposed is actually an inversion of the larger thesis.

The author does not mask the historical context of the passage, but it strikes me that it’s totally silly to make any identity between Europe in the 5th century BC to Europe in the 18th to 20th centuries, and Asia in the 5th century BC to Asia in the 18th to 20th century.

In fact the concept of [différance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance) may be relevant here. Said cannot be so naive as to not understand the chasm between Europe in the Classical World, which was an almost clinical description of the geography, and Europe in the early modern period, which was freighted with the weight of history. The Thracians did not care if they were European, but the Russian nobility yearned to be so thought.

Now transfer this to a typical undergraduate. Are they intuitively aware of the chasm of history, the centuries, the transmutation of words and their implications? To be entirely frank, I think some of the teaching assistants guiding the students are probably too stupid and ignorant to actually understand these nuances themselves.

But the students learn about terms like postcolonialism and Orientalism, and as some of them move into the professions and the media these words became part of the common lexicon to show you are an educated person, just as dialectical materialism was for an earlier generation.

**And that is how postcolonial theory mutated from being a system that decomposes very precise and delimited historical dynamics to becoming an heir to classical Marxism**, a theory for all of history in the past and into the future.

Forgive them their ignorance, for they infer the path through the darkness by Theory alone.
