Ultrasociety: How 10,000 Years of War Made Humans the Greatest Cooperators on Earth

[![UltrasSoc_cover_epub](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UltrasSoc_cover_epub.jpg?resize=300%2C479)![UltrasSoc_cover_epub](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UltrasSoc_cover_epub.jpg?resize=300%2C479)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0185P69LU/geneexpressio-20)A while back I promoted Joe Henrich’s [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691166854/geneexpressio-20). I did finish Frank McLynn’s [Genghis Khan](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00X2ZW5ZI/geneexpressio-20) book, and am re-reading his [Marcus Aurelius biography](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0044BD5Y4/geneexpressio-20). There will be a review of the first book coming out soon, but I will tease here that unlike [Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/10/genghis-khan-by-frank-mclynn.html) I don’t think it would come close to being the best book of the year (in part, because unlike many readers I know a fair amount about the topic). I also have a copy of Mary Beard’s [SPQR: A History of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871404230/geneexpressio-20), and someday really need to get to Dehaene’s [Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DMCVXO0/geneexpressio-20)

**But here’s another must read, Peter Turchin’s [Ultrasociety: How 10,000 Years of War Made Humans the Greatest Cooperators on Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0185P69LU/geneexpressio-20).** This seems like an excellent complement to Ian Morris’ [War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00FOB3IU4/geneexpressio-20), which I have not managed to get to read, in part because I want to hit [Foragers, Farmers, and Fossil Fuels: How Human Values Evolve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00Q0MNEDM/geneexpressio-20). Yet I’ve read a fair number of Peter’s books (see my [10 questions for him](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/10-questions-for-peter-turchin.php)), so I’ll probably be moving this up the stack.

Peter is a serious thinker, and human social complexity and cooperation is an important, and unresolved topic (I am not as sanguine or flip on this David Sloan Wilson). Currently only the [Kindle edition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0185P69LU/geneexpressio-20) is available, but Peter says that the “dead-tree” version should be available in the next few days.

(note, I have to read [The Hive Mind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804785961/geneexpressio-20)!)

**Addendum:** Here’s [Peter’s post](http://peterturchin.com/blog/2015/11/21/ultrasociety-how-10000-years-of-war-made-humans-the-greatest-cooperators-on-earth/) on the book….
