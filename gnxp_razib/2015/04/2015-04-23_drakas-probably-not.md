Drakas! (?) Probably not

[![Drakas_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drakas_cover.jpg?resize=143%2C230)![Drakas_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drakas_cover.jpg?resize=143%2C230)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00APADCWI/geneexpressio-20)Everyone and their mother has heard of the story about the CRISPRed embryos by now. If you haven’t, the original paper is [open access](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5/fulltext.html). Second, Carl Zimmer’s primer is excellent, [Editing Human Embryos: So This Happened](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/22/editing-human-embryos-so-this-happened/). For those who are overly alarmed by the non-ethical aspects, I think this is key:

Livestock and pets. And plants. I think CRISPR is going to be a big deal. It already is a big deal. But some people are worried now about a profusion of designer babies. We need to get calm here. **For something to become a *consumer* product it needs to get much better in terms of probability of outcomes, and we’re a long long way from that.** As [Ramez Naam](https://twitter.com/ramez) pointed out people are very risk averse with their children.

Rather, the real danger is more one of ethics. Something out of S. M. Stirling’s [Draka](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00APADCWI/geneexpressio-20) series where a government or society isn’t bound by normal human ethical standards, and begins to basically treat their population like livestock. As is usually the case the major issues looming are not scientific, but have to do with human volition.
