Happy New Year!

In fact, at this point I’d put a rank order as so: body weight \> free weight \> machines. So I ordered myself a [tower](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002Y2SUU4/geneexpressio-20) that I could do pull ups and chin ups on at home in case I don’t make to the gym. Yes, yes, I know I could just do push ups, but I really like the rapid strain of pull ups, and putting the equipment somewhere salient will probably motivate me more in the morning. And honestly one thing that I worry about in winter is how sick so many of the people in a university gym seem to be, so working out at home seems more advised.

The above video also illustrates one reason I’m wary of the gym: **early January is always packed.** Not looking forward to that.
