Many interesting comments, and I learned a lot. **It’s a thread that I have actually *reread* several times.** For what it’s worth, I got a copy of [The Lean Muscle Diet](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1623364183//geneexpressio-20), mostly because I want to start learning more about the topic, not because I’m taking it as gospel. But one thing I’ve started doing immediately was cut back on the running on frequency, but increase intensity/pace. Also, I’m working in more pull-ups and chin-ups into my routine, and hitting machines less frequently. The squat racks at the gym always have a line out the door, so perhaps I’ll have to [buy one myself](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002EJC990//geneexpressio-20) at some point, because I don’t have the patience to wait 20 minutes (also, there’s going to be a line behind me once I do make it to the rack). Considering the amount of usage they might get it seems like an investment that might pay off? Does anyone have suggestions?
