Two books which would be excellent complements are [Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1107658764/geneexpressio-20) and [God’s War: A New History of the Crusades](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002RI95F4/geneexpressio-20). I’ve gone back to [Wonderful Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H987FS6/geneexpressio-20), and again find myself annoyed by Stephen Jay Gould’s pompous and self-aggrandizing tendencies. But I do find when he goes straight to the descriptive science, such as anatomy which I am not familiar with, he is far less insufferable. Though I’m reading [Wonderful Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H987FS6/geneexpressio-20) partly to get to its rebuttal, [Crucible of Creation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502567/geneexpressio-20). When I can’t handle Gould I’ve been going through Stanislas Dehaene’s [Reading in the Brain: The New Science of How We Read](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SR2Q2I/geneexpressio-20). Years ago I enjoyed his [The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058C6FJ0/geneexpressio-20), and since I’m a big reader I figured his more recent book would be of interest to me. Finally, I’ve put Victor Lieberman’s [Strange Parallels: Volume 2, Mainland Mirrors: Europe, Japan, China, South Asia, and the Islands: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c.800-1830](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003AT11FG/geneexpressio-20) in my stack. I read [volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521804965/geneexpressio-20), but never finished volume 2.

Any books you are reading?
