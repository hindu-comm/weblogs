The end of the bookstore and the end of genre?

[![AmericanGods-Reprint](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AmericanGods-Reprint-168x300.jpg?resize=168%2C300)![AmericanGods-Reprint](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AmericanGods-Reprint-168x300.jpg?resize=168%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FC10MU//geneexpressio-20)The *new* *TNR* seems to be a weird mismash of SJW-clickbait and interesting pieces on aspects of culture which the *old* *TNR* probably wouldn’t have thought to publish. I doubt that this version of *TNR* is long for this world, but I do appreciate pieces such as this conversation between Neil Gaiman and Kazuo Ishigoru, [Breaking the Boundaries Between Fantasy and Literary Fiction](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121982/neil-gaiman-and-kazuo-ishiguro-talk-books-storytelling-dragons). It’s rather self-indulgent, but what do you expect? The main question which they circle around is the nature of genre boundaries. This portion really jumped out at me:

When I was an adolescent the way I would decide how to purchase a book, usually a paperback science fiction or fantasy, was to look for specific authors and covers. There wasn’t really that much planning or research ahead of time. There was a great deal of serendipity involved.

Things are different today. Usually before buying something in person I do some research online. Also, recommendation engines are pretty useful, and good at guiding you to a narrower set of choices attuned to your preferences. **This obviates the need to some extent for genre categories as guides in the first place.**

I’m thinking of this specifically because apparently [Spotify Wants Listeners to Break Down Music Barriers](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/technology/personaltech/spotify-sees-a-future-where-music-genres-dont-really-matter.html) (well, according to Farhad Manjoo). It makes sense for Spotify sense it has so much more data to work with than old style radio stations. Similarly, at some point Amazon will have enough reading and purchase information to get really good at pointing you to authors and works that are suited to your interests.
