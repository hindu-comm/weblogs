I am not part of the echosphere

![twit](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/twit.png?resize=308%2C191)![twit](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/twit.png?resize=308%2C191)If you go into [Twitter analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com/accounts/l0pcn/audience_insights?audience_types=followers%2Corganic&audience_interactions=%2Cimpression&audience_ids=*%2C35304791&custom_types=%2C&targeting_criteria=%5Bobject+Object%5D%2C%5Bobject+Object%5D&attribute_group=lifestyle) you can see various aspects of audience demographics. For example, 85 percent of my Twitter followers are inferred to be male. This actually is exactly in line with surveys of readers I’ve taken for 15 years. So when I saw the number of Republican to Democratic followers I was very curious. When I compared followers, that is, those who follow me, vs. “Organic audience – reached,” which I think includes my impact via retweets and such, the balance is pretty striking. The difference here is pretty easy to understand. Many of my followers are scientists, who will tend to lean left. But the top followers who RT things often lean right, and are non-scientists. E.g., [Glenn Reynolds](https://twitter.com/instapundit), [Jonah Goldberg](https://twitter.com/jonahnro), and on rarer occasions [David Frum](https://twitter.com/davidfrum). In contrast, I rarely get RTs from non-science liberals.
