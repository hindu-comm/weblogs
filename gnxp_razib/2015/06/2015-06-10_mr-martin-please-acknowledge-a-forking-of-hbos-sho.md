Mr. Martin, please acknowledge a “forking” of HBO’s show & the books

[![91-rbDuvMoL.\_SL1500\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/91-rbDuvMoL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C278)![91-rbDuvMoL.\_SL1500\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/91-rbDuvMoL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C278)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20)There are some of us who have waited years. It has even come to pass that we have grown into manhood, and one generation has waned and another waxed as George R. R. Martin has been weaving his series [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20). His [“So Spake Martin”](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/) once had oracular aspect for the patient ones. Now we wait…we wait. Years pass.

And yet a new specter haunts the horizon, the specter of HBO. There are those of us who have not followed this show, which began at the beginning of the decade. We have watched with curiosity as the newcomers have reacted with horror at what we who have waited have [known](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Wedding) for all these years. But we harbor no ill will, we, the waiters. We know. We know the end will come, and a new creation will join the constellation of the volumes which have come before. We wait.

**But now there is talk that the show is proceeding ahead of the books, and that our patience is for naught.** George R. R. Martin needs to make this clear: are the shows “spoiling” the books, or, is the television series a [“fork”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))? Obviously I’m hoping for the second.
