Though it’s not at the same level as Steven Pinker’s [The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0049B1VOU/geneexpressio-20)\*, it’s not that far below it. There was a time when I read a fair amount of cognitive neuroscience. Not so much now. So I’m finally trying to get through [Reading in the Brain: The New Science of How We Read](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SR2Q2I/geneexpressio-20), again, by Stanislas Dehaene. This is partly an exercise of narcissism, since I want to do what I can to understand myself.

[![CoverReadingInTheBrain](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CoverReadingInTheBrain-198x300.jpg?resize=198%2C300)![CoverReadingInTheBrain](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CoverReadingInTheBrain-198x300.jpg?resize=198%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SR2Q2I/geneexpressio-20)Speaking of which, Bryan Caplan, a big fan of Judith Rich Harris’ [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005JSSAH8/geneexpressio-20), reports that [reading is kind of a big deal](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/05/the_hours_acade.html) in developing a child, and impacting their ultimate life outcomes. The effect is modest, but robust. Though also please read [Will Ambrosini’s cautionary comments](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/05/the_hours_acade.html#341917) about interpretation of this result.

So what else is going on? I apologize to those whose comments I don’t respond to who are asking *me* a direct question. Time is finite and it often slips my mind, even though responding to questions is on a “TO-DO”. Also, the new book about Elon Musk, [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KVI76ZS/geneexpressio-20), looks interesting. But I doubt the whole of the text is worth purchasing. I care a lot less about Musk’s family background and personal life than I do about his vision for the human race. But really the latter could be outlined on a napkin.

Finally, [BAPG XII](https://stanfordcehg.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/bapgxii-saturday-may-30-2015/) @Stanford in Palo Alto. May 30th, a Saturday. Looking forward in particular to Michael McLaren’s talk on fitness landscapes.

\* [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCTNIM/geneexpressio-20) is probably more well known, and Pinker’s most successful book in terms of broad cultural impact. But I think [The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0049B1VOU/geneexpressio-20) is his best science book aimed at a general audience.
