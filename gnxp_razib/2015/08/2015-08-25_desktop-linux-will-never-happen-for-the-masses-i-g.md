Desktop linux will never happen for the masses

OMG.

I remember very precisely that it was in the spring of 2008 that I finally transitioned toward being a total desktop Linux user. Basically I’d been in Linux for a few days…forgotten, and tried to watch something on Netflix streaming. I then realized I wasn’t in Windows! Now that Netflix works on Ubuntu I don’t really use Windows at all. I still have a dual-boot notebook, but I have two desktop computers than are Linux only machines.

Well, it looks like I’m somewhat of an outlier. I think the rise of Mac utilization among nerds over the past 10 years has really had an effect. Since you can go into the terminal on a Mac it removes a lot of the advantage of Ubuntu, which after all is still somewhat less “turn-key” that Windows or Mac OS.

Then of course there’s [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)). So in a way Linux has won. Just not in the way people were imagining in the mid-2000s.
