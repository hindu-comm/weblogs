A Note on Uralic (& Finnish) genomics

![609px-Fenno-Ugrian_languages](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/609px-Fenno-Ugrian_languages.png?resize=609%2C480)![609px-Fenno-Ugrian_languages](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/609px-Fenno-Ugrian_languages.png?resize=609%2C480)

I was playing around with some data, and I saw a strange migration from Amerindians to Finns in one run. I looked through replicate runs the same pattern reoccurred. The weird thing is that I had a Siberian data set in there (Ngannassan, Koryak, and Chukchi). The Amerindians were a mix of Pima, Maya, and a few 1000 Genome Peruvians.

To explore this further I got ran TreeMix with progressively fewer populations. I got the Ancient North Eurasian genotype and also put it in there. Using various quality filters I got down to 112,000 SNPs. All of the plots are [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbvkaa0jlq7v10g/treemix.tar.gz?dl=0), but representative ones are below.

As you can whatever I saw was an artifact. Probably due to merging the various Siberian populations together. Now there is a gene flow edge from at least near the Nganassansand Nenets toward the Finnic groups, or from the Finnic groups. The relationship of Mal’ta is complicated by the fact that it’s so old, and, the population structure of North-Central Eurasia seems to have changed several times over the past few tens of thousands of years.
