No time to blog right now, but here’s an important preprint, [A Spatial Framework for Understanding Population Structure and Admixture](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/07/013474):

> Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, > produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer > and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically > limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be > more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so > genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use > genome-wide polymorphism data to build “geogenetic maps”, which, when > applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic > positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect > historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele > frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, > and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as > anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is > explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of > admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the > utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish > warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for > gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring > species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for > which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support > for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool > for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is > implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.
