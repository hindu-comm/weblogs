[![a-cooperative-species](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/a-cooperative-species.gif?resize=210%2C300)![a-cooperative-species](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/a-cooperative-species.gif?resize=210%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050PADW0/geneexpressio-20)Been reading [A Cooperative Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050PADW0/geneexpressio-20) and [A Wonderful Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039330700X/geneexpressio-20). The grammatical sections of [The Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670025852/geneexpressio-20) were heavy-going for me. [Jason Collins](http://jasoncollins.org/2012/03/26/bowles-and-gintiss-a-cooperative-species/) reviewed [A Cooperative Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050PADW0/geneexpressio-20) a few years ago. As for [A Wonderful Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039330700X/geneexpressio-20), it seems to me that Stephen Jay Gould had mastered the ponderous and egotistical prose flourishes evident in [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006135/geneexpressio-20) rather early in his writing career. In any case, Simon Conway Morris’ [The Crucible of Creation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502567/geneexpressio-20), a direct response to Gould’s interpretation of the Burgess Shale finds, is next on my list.

In other news, I’ve been trying out the [ThinkUp](http://Thinkup.com) Twitter analytic service. Not a big fan of Anil Dash so don’t worry, I’m just using the trial. But I think I understand why it’s not gaining traction: **at 5,000+ followers I don’t think I have enough to warrant the utility of the service.** 5,000 isn’t too shabby, so I suspect the market segment for which this might be valuable, people with 50 K followers, is just too small (at least at the price point they’re asking for).
