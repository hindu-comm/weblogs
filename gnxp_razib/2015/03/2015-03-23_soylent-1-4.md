Soylent 1.4

[![2015-03-22 22.55.17](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-22-22.55.17-168x300.jpg?resize=168%2C300)![2015-03-22 22.55.17](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-22-22.55.17-168x300.jpg?resize=168%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ODCNCCO/geneexpressio-20)So about six months ago or so I ordered [Soylent](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ODCNCCO/geneexpressio-20). Specifically, [Soylent 1.4](http://blog.soylent.me/post/112067551237/soylent-1-4-begins-shipping-today). My interest in Soylent is due to the fact that I’m a very busy person plotting the subversion of America’s progressive liberal democratic order, and everyone knows that Peter Thiel and the Illuminati are behind Soylent. More seriously, I’m thinking of replacing lunch with Soylent.

The new version has no oil packets. It took literally 1 minute to make the concoction. Tasting it with a few friends I have to say that it’s not half bad, better than many protein shakes I’ve had. Version 1.4 is very slightly sweet, with some salty aftertaste. It is a bit reminiscent of pancake batter according to one of my friends. I’d recommend it.

**Update:** Over the past few days several of my friends have tried Soylent 1.4. First, there’s a consensus that without flavoring it’s basically like drinking pancake batter. Second, there don’t seem to be major issues with gas, as has been the case with previous iterations of Soylent.
