Why my Substack posts are better and worse than ancestry calculators

Of all my Substack posts, [Ashkenazi Jewish genetics: a match made in the Mediterranean](https://razib.substack.com/p/ashkenazi-jewish-genetics-a-match?r=u0rd&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) has been the most popular of the paid posts. It prompted this response from a reader:

The issue here is that my Substack is doing something different than what personal genomics companies are trying to do. My Substsack post is giving a survey of a whole population and its history, a personal genomics test is trying to give an individual estimate that is intelligible. When 23andMe or the other companies tell you are are 99% “Ashkenazi Jewish” it is simply giving you confirmation that you’re within the range of variation typical for Ashkenazi Jews (there is some suspicions from genealogy enthusiasts that 23andMe smooths out differences between Galicianers and Litvaks, for example).

Imagine that 23andMe told its Jewish customers that they were 45.3% Northern Levantine, 40% Southwest European, and 9.7% Northern European. How would they interpret it? Sophisticated users would understand this points to a deep history of admixture, but most users are not sophisticated. They want to know that they’re Ashkenazi Jewish, and how Jewish they are (most will be nearly 100%, but some people may have non-Ashkenazi cryptic ancestry).

When I worked for Embark Vet. one of the issues that the canine DNA test was having is that we were looking for wolf ancestry in dogs, as some customers with F1’s or backcrosses wanted to test their pooch. But, it turned out that you had to be careful because some northern Arctic dog breeds kept coming back with “wolf” ancestry at low fractions because they did have ancient wolf ancestry. But that’s not what the wolf test was designed to pick up.
