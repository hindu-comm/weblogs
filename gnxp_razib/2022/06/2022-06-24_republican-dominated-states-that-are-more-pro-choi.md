Republican dominated states that are more pro-choice than you think

Because our politics have been nationalized, it’s easy to forget there are still regional quirks and variations. Comparing Pew’s [2014](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/) views on abortion by state with 2020 election results, you can see that states like Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska are far more Republican and pro-Trump than they are anti-abortion. That didn’t matter too much…until recently.
