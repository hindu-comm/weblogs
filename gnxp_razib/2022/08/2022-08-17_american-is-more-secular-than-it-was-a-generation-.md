American is more secular than it was a generation ago

*The Wall Street Journal* has an op-ed, [Religion Is Dying? Don’t Believe It Many of the ‘Nones’ aren’t secular; they belong to minority faiths. The problem is how to count them](https://www.wsj.com/articles/religion-is-dying-dont-believe-it-nones-others-surveys-faith-institutions-atheists-agnostics-practice-minority-11659017037), which engages in a lot of sophistry. The co-authors worked with the late Rodney Stark, who died on July 21st of 2022 (seven days before publication). Stark has argued for fifty years that the vibrancy of religion is determined by the offerings that people can choose from. A “religious free market” like the US is optimal for the phenomenon. This is why the secularization of the US over the last thirty years has been disturbing since it goes against their theory.

The authors of the op-ed assert:

> Data from five recent U.S. population surveys point to the vibrancy, > ubiquity and growth of religion in the U.S. Americans are becoming > more religious, and religious institutions are thriving. Consistent > with some previous studies but contrary to widely held assumptions, > many people who report no religious affiliation—and even many > self-identified atheists and agnostics—exhibit substantial levels of > religious practice and belief.

The evidence is mostly sophistry. It is probably true that there are more small churches as the big churches collapse, but a lot of small churches may still mean fewer religious people than a few big churches.

Here is belief in God and religious attendance from the GSS (one of their sources), and the trend is obvious:

We’re still mostly a religious nation. But there has been a massive breaking of the uniform religious consensus that was the norm in the 80’s and 90’s, where nominally religious people thought being irreligious was a step too far.
