Ancient DNA Selection Paper Just Dropped!

Sometimes statistics confirm what you can already intuitively discern. I’m an avid reader of the ancient DNA and pigmentation literature. **It was immediately obvious to me that the Bronze Age Northern European samples were darker than modern populations in that region.** There are massive sample sizes for modern Europeans, and it jumped out at me that the *derived* SNP at *SLC45A2* was at a lower frequency two to four thousand years ago than it is today. This paper confirms that selection not only occurred during the Bronze Age, but has been happening in the historical period…

**Note:** The backstory on why I had my suspicions about this goes back to 2009. When the first Reich lab India paper came out I was pretty skeptical that the “Ancestral North Indians” were so similar to Northern Europeans. My rationale was straightforward: we should see way more blonde and blue-eyed people in Northern India and Pakistan. Nick Patterson pointed out the relevance of natural selection. Perhaps the Northern Indians got darker? There is a bit of evidence of this for some loci, but the Narasimhan et al. paper had a bunch of Sintashta, who are probably the best ancestral population proxy for the early Indo-Aryans, and they were clearly just not as lightly pigmented as related people on the Baltic today. The Sintashta were very similar to their relatives in Poland genetically, but they diverged from their Northern European relatives 4,500 years ago as the Fatyanovo population migrated eastward, and were probably in India when selection was changing the allele frequencies around *SLC45A2*.
