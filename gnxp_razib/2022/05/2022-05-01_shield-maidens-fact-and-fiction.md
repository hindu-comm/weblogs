Shield-maidens, fact and fiction

  
Ed West has a post up about the pervasiveness of shield-maidens in modern dramatizations of the Viking culture: [The hunt for the kick-ass Viking girlboss](https://edwest.substack.com/p/did-kick-ass-viking-women-exist?s=r). In terms of how it is depicted, there is a ludicrousness to it all. At least in *Game of Thrones* [Gwendoline Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendoline_Christie) is 6’3 and not particularly delicate of build. West points out how unrealistic it is that Scarlett Johansson’s “Black Widow” character can take down men far larger than her, but Johannssen is aware of how stupid it all is. When asked by a fawning late-night talk show host (I believe it was Steven Colbert) how she did all those things, she stated plainly that they made it seem like she could do all those things. At 5’3 Johannssen must be conscious of the physical differences between men and women.

Here’s a [paper](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/223/2/jeb212365/223648/Sexual-dimorphism-in-human-arm-power-and-force) on arm strength differences between men and women:
