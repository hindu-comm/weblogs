Eurasia, the Stone Age and revenge of the Danes!

In the last week, I put up a big two-part series of posts on Substack, [The wolf at history’s door](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-wolf-at-historys-door?s=w) and [Casting out the wolf in our midst](https://razib.substack.com/p/casting-out-the-wolf-in-our-midst?s=w), about the spread of Indo-European (men) 5,000 years ago. By coincidence, a **massive** preprint on ancient DNA just came out of the Willerslev coalition of researchers, [Population Genomics of Stone Age Eurasia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.04.490594v1). It really is massive, and is hard to summarize, but here’s the abstract:

> The transitions from foraging to farming and later to pastoralism in > Stone Age Eurasia (c. 11-3 thousand years before present, BP) > represent some of the most dramatic lifestyle changes in human > evolution. We sequenced 317 genomes of primarily Mesolithic and > Neolithic individuals from across Eurasia combined with radiocarbon > dates, stable isotope data, and pollen records.

There’s so much, I can’t really reduce. Here are some highlights

1 – New hunter-gatherer cluster with a focus in the eastern Ukraine/Russian border region. Between the Dnieper and Don. Because I can barely read the admixture grap in extended figure 4, I’m not totally clear where this group is positioned in the graph, though it has some Causus hunter-gatherer

2 – Neolithicization was pretty slow (demic) in most of Europe, except Scandinavia. We knew this. Steppe arrival was faster everywhere, but mixed with local Neolithic substrate…except in Scandinavia, where there was straight up replacement. But Scandinavians do have Neolithic ancestry…so where’s that from?

3 – The paper claims that the Corded Ware people mixed with Globular Amphora culture. I’m pretty sure if they looked closely all the South Asians will steppe ancestry will show this too, and not any other type of European Neolithic.

4 – Scandinavia seems to have had several replacements even after the arrival of the early Battle Axe people. This is clear in Y chromosome turnover, from R1a to R1b and finally to mostly I1, the dominant lineage now. They claim that later Viking and Norse ancestry is mostly from the last pulse during the Nordic Bronze Age.

5 – They claim to detect it’s clear that Neolithic ancestry in North/Central/Eastern Europe was from Southeast Europe, while that in Western Europe was from Southwest Europe. This is expected.

6 – They confirm that in terms of polygenic prediction Yamnaya people were taller. They claim that it looks like N vs. S European differences in height aren’t selection, but stratification (Yamnaya predicts tallness).

7 – They find that dark hair and skin in Europeans seems correlated with WHG ancestry. This seems to confirm that the WHG were indeed dark of hair and eye. They find that lighter skin/hair really seems to come with Anatolian farmers and Yamnaya. Not the hunter-gatherers. Though selection does start earlier. They assert this has something to do with UV/Vitamin D, but if that, why were the HG groups dark? (if blue-eyed in the case of WHG) I think the explanation is some interaction with the agro-pastoralist lifestyle.

They also confirm that pigmentation selection went on until 3,000 years ago. This is obvious, and to me, it explains easily the heterogeneity in some CWC and post-CWC populations. Some of the early Bell Beakers in Britain look totally modern in pigmentation, but other populations are darker than they should be.

8 – Lots of selection in diet and immune system. What you’d expect. Basically a lot of illnesses might be mixture of the various populations. For example, diabetes comes from WHG.

9 – Neolithic Anatolians seem associated with some psychiatric issues. Could this be due to early dense-living? No idea. Also, they find EDU was selected for (one locus). Might be pleiotropy though.

10 – They find the African R1b around Lake Chad in some Ukrainian samples. Seems to confirm that somehow it’s from Eastern Europe? Weird.

Anyway, read it and tell me what you think.
