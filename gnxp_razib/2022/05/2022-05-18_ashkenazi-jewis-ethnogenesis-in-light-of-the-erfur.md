Ashkenazi Jewish ethnogenesis in light of the Erfurt medieval DNA

I’ve been asked how this modifies the narrative [in my Substack](https://razib.substack.com/p/ashkenazi-jewish-genetics-a-match?s=w) piece. I’d say only on the margins.

The Erfurt community dates to the 1300’s. Interestingly it shows variation in Eastern European ancestry. The authors suggest that genetically there are actually two clusters here, though sociocultural they’re identical. The best guess is that the Eastern European enriched population migrated to Erfurt from the east (there is some difference in the isotope analysis for the teeth). Modern Ashkenazi Jews show less variability and are positioned between the two Erfurt communities in PCA and admixture space. The group without Eastern European ancestry seems to resemble Sephardi and Italian Jews. This isn’t surprising, since they confirm Ashkenazi Jews are some proportional mix of a Middle Eastern population, Italians, and Eastern Europeans, while Sephardi and Italian Jews clearly just lack the last.

The Erfurt community experienced a strong bottleneck, stronger than the one in modern Ashkenazi Jews. This implies that there are other groups out there unsampled, and modern Ashkenazim descend from that. This isn’t surprising, one feedback I got is that there are so many medieval Jews for the inferred population size during this period (going by the texts). I think one issue might be a lot of the medieval Jewish communities simply went extinct. Many of them were undergoing similar dynamics, but not all contributed to future Ashkenazi ancestry.

The homogeneity (relative) of modern Ashkenazim is probably due to late-medieval metapopulation dynamics.
