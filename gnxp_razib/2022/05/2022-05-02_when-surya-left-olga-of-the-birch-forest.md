When Surya left Olga of the Birch Forest

In the recent film [The Northman](https://indianbronson.substack.com/p/the-northman-reviewed?utm_source=%2Finbox&utm_medium=reader2&s=r) the protagonist, Amleth, has a romantic relationship with a woman, “Olga of the Birch Forest.” Amleth was a Viking who raided Kievan Rus, and Olga was a Slavic woman who was captured in a raid.

Birch trees flourish across the temperate zone, but they’re particularly dominant in the north, due to being hardier. When I [wrote about Finnish genetics, history and culture](https://razib.substack.com/p/frontier-finns-cabins-rakes-and-indians?s=w) last year I stumbled upon the fact that early Finns who arrived in America (usually they were identified as “Swedes” because they were ruled by the Swedish Crown) often found an immediate affinity with northern Native American tribes. One explanation is that Finns and northern Native Americans are both “birch forest people.” Many aspects of their culture were similar, down to their moccasins.

As it happens, a long long time ago, and far far away, my forefathers were also birch forest people. Long before Olga’s kith and kin occupied the birch forests of northwestern Russia, they were occupied by the [Fantyanovo-Balanovo culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatyanovo%E2%80%93Balanovo_culture). Until recently this cattle-raising society on the northern edge of the Indo-European world was assumed to perhaps be Baltic-speaking due to local hydronyms, but ancient DNA retrieved from Fatyanovo-Balanovo suggests a different answer. The vast majority of the men in their burial grounds carry Y chromosomal haplogroup R1a-Z93. This lineage is now found **overwhelmingly in Indo-Iranian people, as well as in the Altai region.**

The ancient DNA transect and succession is clear  
– Fatnyanovo-Balanovo expanded eastward  
– Turned into the Abashevo copper miners west of the Urals  
– Gave rise to the Sintashta on the southern slope of the Urals into northwest Kazakhstan

At this point the Sintashta around 2000 BC exploded and turned into the Andronovo Horizon that covered much of Central Eurasia between 2000 and 1500 BC:

At some point Olga of the Birch Forest was left behind. A recent [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zia-Rahman/publication/349651253_Complete_mitogenomes_document_substantial_genetic_contribution_from_the_Eurasian_Steppe_into_northern_Pakistani_Indo-Iranian_speakers/links/621e33e27106690c08530452/Complete-mitogenomes-document-substantial-genetic-contribution-from-the-Eurasian-Steppe-into-northern-Pakistani-Indo-Iranian-speakers.pdf) estimates that about 8% of the mtDNA lineages among populations like the Kalash and Pashtun in northern Pakistan is of steppe provenance. This is in contrast to about 2% to the south and east in “mainland” South Asia. This is contrast to the frequency of R1a in this region of Pakistan, about 50%, and 25% in mainland South Asia. In terms of total genome ancestry, about 25-30% of the ancestry in northern Pakistan among these groups is steppe, with an average across the subcontinent a bit below 15% (I did a weighted calculation a while ago).

What you see here is a massive drop off in maternal lineages of steppe Indo-Iranians, and a strong persistence of Y chromosomes, with total genome content being about in the middle. Figure 4c of [Narasimhan et al.](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/eaat7487.full_.pdf) shows the same thing, with R1a fractions way higher than total genome content of steppe heritage.

This sex-specific admixture is not limited to South Asia. It can be found in [the European context](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217307248) as well, though rarely as extreme.

So what’s going on here? **One thing to note about Indo-European people is that on the whole they are patrilineal and patrilocal and exogamous**. That is, one’s identity was determined by one’s father. Women moved into the household’s of their husband, and tended to be unrelated to them. This seems to be a perfect recipe for the assimilation of women into a society. But that’s not the reason all of these culturally and genetically different women are being brought into Indo-European societies. It is because the men are moving, and migrating very long distances.

In a podcast last year with myself and Patrick Wyman David Anthony claimed that they have detected Yamnaya individuals buried in western Mongolia and in Europe who are clearly related to each other. This means that Yamnaya cultural and social networks spanned Eurasia due to their mobility. In*The Northman* Olga was shipped from Russia all the way to Iceland. But this was the exception, not the rule. As Indo-European men expanded out of the core Eurasia zone, they moved as bachelor groups, and assimilated local women.

And not just Indo-Europeans. Among Uralic people, as well as some Siberians, [a particular Y chromosome](https://razib.substack.com/p/go-west-young-siberian?s=w) is very dominant from the Baltic all the way to eastern Siberia.

It’s [a branch of N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_N-M231#/media/File:Prehistoric_migration_routes_for_Y-chromosome_haplogroup_N_lineage.png), and it is clearly East Asian in origin. It seems to have shown up in the Baltic region about 2,500 years ago, and it’s now the dominant haplogroup in Finland, and the Baltic countries. And yet the total genome content of modern day Finns that is East Asian is about 5% or so, even if N3a (TAT-C) is about 70%. There are almost no Siberian mtDNA lineages among Finns (OK \~1%). Among the Saami, about 25% of the genome is Siberian, but less than 10% of the mtDNA. Just like the Indo-Europeans, there seems to have been a male-mediated migration west. Why didn’t they bring women?

Can you imagine women and children moving fast across the zone of Eurasia*north*of the birch forest???

**I think the common thing that connects the Indo-European groups here and the Uralic people is that there was a period when they were highly mobile over very long distances**. This does not mean that women and children could never be involved. Some women were moving with their men judging by the mtDNA here and there. But, on the whole these were strongly male biased migrations. These were young and robust groups of men with few ties that moved rapidly across territory. There wasn’t time or inclination to have a baggage train.

Another way to look at it is from the gene’s-eye first view. Let’s look for explosive punctuated clusters within haplogroups.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/haploI.jpg?resize=637%2C545&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/haploI.jpg?resize=637%2C545&ssl=1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884158/?source=post_page---------------------------#SD2)

The above is a phylogenetic tree with I1 and I2 (Y). I1 is dominant in Northern Europe, and particular Scandinavia, and I2 is mostly found in the Balkans, though it was once dominant in Northern Europe during the late Neolithic. Both come out of Western European Hunter-Gatherers. Notice that I1 is geographically distinct, and the genetic distance between the tips is small, and there’s a veritable exposition from a recent common ancestor. Contrast it with I2, which has deeper divergences between the nodes, and a stead accumulation of informative mutations.

I1 seems to have been assimilated into the early Corded Ware society, and expanded north and west after the assimilation, and become very successful. I2, less so.

R2, R1a, R1b, and Q all descend from P. You can see just visually that R1b and R1a seem to diverge from a really recent common ancestor, and all these tips are equally differentiated. This is due to a rapid population expansion before diversification in a stepwise fashion.

Here’s another figure which shows you in a clearer way what’s going on:

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-03-at-2.04.36-AM.jpg?resize=640%2C247&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-03-at-2.04.36-AM.jpg?resize=640%2C247&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-03-at-2.04.36-AM.jpg?ssl=1)

Note R1b, R1a, I1 and E1b. E1b is associated with the Bantu expansion, though they time it somewhat earlier.

Finally, here’s a graph that shows you how spread out N3a is, and how recent it is:

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-s2.0-S0002929716301604-gr1.jpg?resize=640%2C853&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-s2.0-S0002929716301604-gr1.jpg?resize=640%2C853&ssl=1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929716301604)

There are haplogroups that are old and venerable, like G and J, that come in various branches, and seem associated with gradual increase in frequency during farming. But, there are a subset of Y chromosomal haplogroups associated with “burst” within the last 6,000 years or so. **I would hold that most of these bursts are due to massive radiation of groups of men who are defined by a particular lifestyle and ecology they’ve mastered**.
