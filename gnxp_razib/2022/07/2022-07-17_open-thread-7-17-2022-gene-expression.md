The new [Rings of Power](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09QH98YG1/geneexpressio-20) series debuts on September 2nd, so they have a new trailer out. I’m skeptical, but they pulled all the stops for the effects. My expectation is that this will be to the *Tolkien* canon what Taco Bell is to Mexican food, but I will be happy to be surprised. It is obvious that they are taking [Black Númenóreans](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Black_N%C3%BAmen%C3%B3reans) a bit too literally, but if they execute well on things unrelated to the identity politics I bet people will be willing to overlook that (it could be that this was just the price they’d have to pay in Hollywood to get this produced).

Tad Williams [Into the Narrowdark – Last King of Osten Ard Book 3](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09JBCZ7VW/geneexpressio-20) is good. Williams, in my opinion, is great at navigating between George R. R. Martin’s somewhat excessively gruesome world-building with Brandon Sanderson’s “boy scout” approach. Like R. Scott Bakker he is excellent at the fashioning of human-like elven analogs that push into the uncanny valley territory of “human nature,” very much like us but different in critical ways as to seem alien and fantastic.

[A Late Pleistocene human genome from Southwest China](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00928-9). I haven’t had time to read this closely, but thanks for posting the link.

I don’t have time to write up all the ancient DNA that is coming out, but I do try and read it. Keep the links coming; I do appreciate them.

Most of you know I ungated my Substack podcasts after two weeks. The [reviews](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/razib-khans-unsupervised-learning/id1542136715?ls=1) have trailed off, which means that there will be ‘less discovery’ of them. If you have a moment, I would appreciate a five-star (I may mention this on my podcast at some point, I don’t push this heavily).

I’ve been writing on this blog for 20 years. One sad trend is that a huge swath of academics are becoming incredibly conformist, censorious and ideologically motivated. Yes, this tendency was always there in a field like sociology, for example, but now it’s everywhere. The public doesn’t even know the tenth of it from what the stuff I hear. Just keep your skeptical hat on…
