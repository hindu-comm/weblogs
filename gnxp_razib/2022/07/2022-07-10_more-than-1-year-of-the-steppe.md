More than 1 year of the steppe

Over at my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) I’ve spent more than a year writing about the cultural and genetic impact of the Eurasian steppe. I’ve put out a large number of essays, so I want to post them here in case you missed one. In reverse order…

[A Hun by any other name – On the genetic trail of Europe’s enduring bête noire](https://razib.substack.com/p/a-hun-by-any-other-name):

> The specter of these pitiless barbarians swooping in on horseback had > haunted the ancients, their horror recorded in histories that filtered > down to modern Europeans. In these classical texts, the Huns were the > epitome of brutal and alien savages whose raison d’etre was total > victory on the battlefield, punctuated by gluttonous orgies of flesh, > food and drink. They were the embodiment of the European cultural > imagination’s bête noire, the austere and erudite Roman aristocrat > contrasting sharply with the brutish barbarian guzzling mare’s milk > and gnawing on a hunk of raw meat while in the saddle.

[The wolf at history’s door](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-wolf-at-historys-door) and [Casting out the wolf in our midst](https://razib.substack.com/p/casting-out-the-wolf-in-our-midst) are more anthropological and focused on the *koryos* and their role in shaping Eurasian history. I count these two as steppe-adjacent since they lack the chronological focus of the other pieces.

[Dark Horse out of the Steppe Fishing the Sintashta, Scythians and Sarmatians out of obscurity](https://razib.substack.com/p/dark-horse-out-of-the-steppe).

[Steppe 2.0: would you swipe right on a steppe brother? – The biological and social consequences of Yamnaya nomadism](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe):

> The Yamnaya-powered transformation of Europe and Asia more than 5,000 > years ago was a social and economic revolution, with the explosion of > nomadic pastoralism across the Eurasian steppe. Its downstream > linguistic and cultural consequences are with us to this very day: > billions of us speak Indo-European languages, and we preserve those > ancestral religious beliefs both in the shared mythology of the West > and in the living religious traditions of India. To premodern minds > untouched by science, the rise of obscure tribes to world conquest > would have been evidence of divine providence and fate. Theirs was a > world of miracles, and the gods always chose favorites. By the 20th > century, supernatural explanations had foundered on the shoals of > scientific materialism. But unless you were a Marxist, history was a > matter of narrow description of particular places and times, rather > than general theoretical narratives that explained the arc and ebb of > societies and cultures. It was one damn thing after another, with > broader patterns attributed to the vague laws of probability.

[Hungarians as the ghost of the Magyar confederacy: The cultural legacy of the Magyars far outweighs their genetic impact](https://razib.substack.com/p/hungarians-as-the-ghost-of-the-magyar). Another steppe-adjacent piece, though this one focuses on one nation so it’s more appropriate.

[Steppe 1.1a: A nowhere man’s world](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11a-a-nowhere-mans-world) and [Steppe 1.1b: culture vultures descend](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11b-culture-vultures-descend) [are two posts about the Corded Ware, Bell Beakers, and the steppe intrusion into Europe.](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11a-a-nowhere-mans-world)

[Steppe 1.0, Going Nomad: The early Indo-Europeans’ great leap forward](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-10-going-nomad):

> Today 3.5 billion humans speak Indo-European languages, which dominate > Eurasia from Spain to the Indian subcontinent. This is the legacy of > the pastoralists who roamed the Pontic steppe north of the Black sea > 5,000 years ago. They were the original Indo-Europeans. They pioneered > the nomadic lifestyle, leaving behind hard toil at the plow and > thankless foraging in cold Siberian forests. They chose instead to > wander the open grasslands in search of fresh pastures for their > herds. They were the first to unleash young warriors raised as roving > nomads upon the world, predatory packs marching the breadth of a > continent in a few centuries. We don’t know what they called > themselves. We don’t know the names of those who led them. But their > cultural innovations and the choices they made transformed our world > and made us who we are today. These nameless people left no monuments > or seminal texts. Instead, we live with their language, their gods and > their genes.

Finally, the two introductory posts, [Entering Steppelandia: pop. 7.7 billion: Why the steppe matters to me, and why it should matter to you](https://razib.substack.com/p/entering-steppelandia-pop-77-billion) and [Library of the Steppe: They didn’t read, but you should](https://razib.substack.com/p/library-of-the-steppe).
