Yes, we want to be richer, but in large parts of the country, there is a strong tendency to want to bake incumbency advantages into the cake. Texas and Florida still retain relatively open development cultures, which explains much of their growth. Meanwhile, of course people are fleeing California due to the expensive (at least if you want to have children).

We’ll probably stabilize to somewhere between 4 and 8 episodes a month. The [last](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/hindu-nationalism) [two](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/a-carvaka-speaks-about-hindu-nationalism) have been very popular (they touch on Hindu nationalism).

Having done these podcasts now for a few months…the [BrownCast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/) is quite different than [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/). On [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/) we’re tackling technical and scholarly topics, and the goal is clarity and density of exposition. Not dialogue as such. [BrownCast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/) is different.

**This causes issues because speaking is far lower data density and less structured than writing**. During every podcast, I take notes but rarely get a chance to follow up. Extemporaneous digressions are common. To be frank, it’s probably interesting, but the quality of insight is just lower on a substantive scale.

Written dialogue and disagreement is fruitful because of the external structure imposed upon it, removing the ability of individuals to temporize, dodge, and digress. It makes human stupidity just a little less stupid.

Speaking of stupid. Last week I was having beers with a member of the “mainstream media” who was coming through Austin. We were talking all things D.C., and I mentioned offhand that a key aspect of [Ilhan Omar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar) that is not spoken of enough is that she’s likely not very smart in comparison to the average member of Congress. She graduated from North Dakota State University with bachelor’s degrees in political science and international studies in 2011. Her B.A. likely indicates an ability to parrot platitudes. Not the ability to think analytically, or, to engage in verbal parsing so as to be subtle enough to maintain deniability. Her attempt to [lift the ban on trans powerlifters](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/omar-demands-usa-powerlifting-lift-ban-on-trans-women/) is probably sincere.

Relative stupidity is I think an explanation for these sorts of cringe-inducing tweets:

[An Anarchist View of Human Social Evolution](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/an-anarchist-view-of-human-social-evolution/). Peter Turchin reviews a tendentious essay. Of course he’s correct. Of course it won’t matter.

Obviously I talk about genetics. At least what we knew in the summer of 2018. I would like to thank [Priya Moorjani](https://moorjanilab.org/) in particular for detailed feedback on my initial draft.

[Walter Jones, congressman who worked to atone for his Iraq war vote, is dead at 76](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article225147640.html). Jones was an honest and sincere man. That’s why he never became nationally successful as a politician.

There are so few science blogs in the world now that are active. But here is a new one on quantitative evolutionary biology, [After Sol](https://locusofctrl.github.io/blog/).

[The Dune Reboot Could Be the Next Lord of the Rings](https://www.cbr.com/dune-reboot-lord-of-the-rings/). Unlikely, but one can hope.

[Cupertino Mayor: “Build the Wall”](https://medium.com/@rmehlinger/cupertino-mayor-build-the-wall-cb34fb3cc9fa).

[A Bell Beaker superhighway](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/02/a-bell-beaker-superhighway.html).

[Patterns of African and Asian admixture in the Afrikaner population of South Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/542761v1). No big surprise when it comes to the issue of admixture (confirms what I found). But there are some interesting suggestions of really strong selection. I would bet not a true positive, but if I’m wrong, super notable.

In general I seem to agree with Wes, so I didn’t see the point in reading a collection of his essays…but a friend suggested I really should because it’s that good. So there you go.

[Tides of History](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/df37e252-8e35-4f4f-b83f-17125aec9a8d) has been on fire recently. [Games of Thrones and Late Medieval Politics](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/df37e252-8e35-4f4f-b83f-17125aec9a8d). Patrick Wyman’s podcast is one where when there’s a new episode I immediately listen and ignore the rest of the queue. It’s that good.

Highly recommend a listen. Armand Leroi, author of [The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20), is one of the guests.

[Characterization of prevalence and health consequences of uniparental disomy in four million individuals from the general population](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/540955v1).

Several people have asked me about my reduced frequency of posting. A major issue is that I’ve been trying to figure out how to implement the [MemberPress](https://memberpress.com/) plugin to my satisfaction (the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan) I’ve set up for the BrownCast is easier to manage obviously). I have particular concerns and needs, and it’s not entirely easy to customize in the way I want. But at this point, I think I’ve implemented “leaky gating” for this website in a way I want. I am only gating the long-form essays. They will become free after about a month (and you get a few freebies, so it allows outside sites to link without a major issue). I’m currently set up for one tier, a \$2/month membership that renews every month. The [registration page is here](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/register/gnxp-premium-post-membership/). You can change your status (pause, cancel), on the [account](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/account/) page. These two links are on the top right.

It seems everything works correctly **except the password reset email**. I’ll try and get it fixed, but if anyone has an issue you can email me until I get that working.
