Salman Rushdie and me, 30 years on

![Salman Rushdie with Bernie Sanders, 2004](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rushdie.jpg?resize=249%2C186&ssl=1)

Readers of this weblog know that I have a peculiar relationship to the [Salman Rushdie controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses_controversy) in the late 1980s. When I first heard the name “Salman Rushdie” and book called [The Satanic Verses](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004KABDMA/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=B002SR2Q2I&linkCode=w61&imprToken=AOj1Gf38WZ7nBwPWyacnpg&slotNum=0) I was by chance *not* in the United States. I happened to be spending my winter vacation in Bangladesh and was in a rural area of Comilla (near the eastern border with India) traveling with family, visiting shrines dedicated to Sufi ancestors of mine and such. To be frank, I was already skeptical of religion by that point, having realized years ago that people*believed* in supernatural beings in a deep and intuitive way that I never had. But, my cultural identity still remained nominally Muslim.

Somehow, in rural Bangladesh, word had gotten out that a writer of Indian and Muslim origin, and British national background, had written a blasphemous novel. A group of religious students approached my uncle, who was traveling with us, to have us “translate” some leaflets that were printed in English that they had gotten their hands on. My late uncle was by training a geologist, but his primary focus in life was as a member of the [Tablighi Jamaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat). These students trusted my uncle immediately and knew that we, his nephews, could speak English. But the pamphlets contained material that was totally inappropriate for children. I remember specifically lines to the effect that “Salman Rushdie claims that Muhammad’s wives and daughters were whores.” To be frank, I did not know the word for “whore” in Bengali, and I did not want to talk about the sexually explicit material that was printed in the leaflet in any case.

With some hindsight, this incident in the late 1980s illustrates the viral power of propaganda and lies. By the end of the process what Rushdie had written was immaterial. **The truth was less important than the cause**, and the cause was defending the honor of Islam against an irtidad.

To be entirely honest, the “truth being less important than the cause” is something that is much more prominent in public life from what I can tell today than it was then. When I went back to the United States our class had a discussion about the issue, and my very liberal teacher (she was a major supporter of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988) took a straightforward position in defense of free speech, despite the fact two of her students (myself and Egyptian boy) were from Muslim backgrounds. After the Charlie Hebdo massacre, some American and European writers temporized. That is our age.
