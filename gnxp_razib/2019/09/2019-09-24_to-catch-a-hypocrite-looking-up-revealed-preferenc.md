To catch a hypocrite: looking up revealed preferences

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/allseeingeye.jpeg?resize=256%2C197&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/allseeingeye.jpeg?resize=256%2C197&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/allseeingeye.jpeg?ssl=1)One of the strange things about the whole Justin Trudeau brown/black-face affair is that it makes someone like me, nonwhite, but unconvinced of the extreme racism of most white people, reflect a bit. I spent my formative years in overwhelmingly white environments and didn’t encounter that much racism. I did not know anyone who did black or brown-face. Or so I think. Could it be that behind my back this what a lot of white people were doing?

I’m skeptical, but I’m not sure.

That being said, Justin Trudeau is a certain type of “progressive” white person when it comes to racial matters who puts a lot of stock in symbolics. So this is pretty bizarre for him to have done repeatedly. My own personal issue with this is always that I don’t see these people revealing in their life choices that they believe all the stuff about diversity they say. **These people marry white people, and they live among white people, and are friends with mostly white people, all the while talking loudly about how nonwhite people are awesome!** (though to be frank my personal experience is once you disagree with a woke white person you are not so awesome anymore even if you are from a “community of color”….)

With the beauty of the internet, there is a simple way to check if some people “walk the walk.” A few days ago an educational consultant of some sort decried “dead white males.” The person was himself a white male. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if this person who believes in diversity walked the walk of diversity. Within a few minutes, I uncovered the fact that this person lived in a 94% white neighborhood tract according to the census (the city in which he lives is 78% white).

This person, the author of *Reaching and Teaching Students in Poverty: Strategies for Erasing the Opportunity Gap* and *Case Studies on Diversity and Social Justice Education* has done quite well for himself. The house in which he lives is valued at \$456,000 dollars in a city where the median home value is \$280,100.

So how did I find all this out in a few minutes?

1.  Look up someone in [Family Tree
    Now](https://www.familytreenow.com/). I checked the CV of the person
    above to get a sense of age and where they had lived. Family Tree
    Now tells you where people have lived as well as their ages, so it
    allows one to make a positive identification. 2.  The easiest way to lookup demographics is [Justice
    Map](http://www.justicemap.org/). It draws on census data. Put the
    address in, and you’ll see the racial demographics visually. 3.  [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com) has home values.

Why are these tools relevant? **Sometimes it is useful to know where someone has “come from.”**For example, it is easy to find out if particular people speaking on class issues who seem to be vague about their own background come from the upper-middle-class (lookup where they lived and the value of the home in which they grew up). Usually, when someone doesn’t mention their class background in this context they are privileged or grew up as such.

The racial stuff is more interesting because there is constant talk about it today in the United States. But in the choices well-educated Americans make they exhibit underlying beliefs and preferences often at variance with their averred values (at least once they have children; diversity is something of a ‘life phase’).

Sometimes the results of this snooping can be weird. Recently a black education professor at NYU wrote an op-ed weirdly stating that elite schools were eugenic. I mention his race because this warrior for social justice happens to live on a block that is 89% white near the NYU campus.
