Phenotype does not imply ancestry (always)

One issue is that though the WHG tended toward high frequency of the derived *OCA2-HERC2* haplotype, other populations clearly carried it, **the other is that admixture is so far in the past that having blue or brown eyes is not informative to any degree of ancestry.** There were probably relict populations of WHG less than 4,000 years ago ([David has mentioned](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/) of a sample less than 3,000 years ago in Scandinavia), but the admixture of WHG into other groups was very long ago. More than 1,500 generations ago. To a great extent, it seems plausible that even within populations variation in ancestral fractions should be marginal to non-existent.

But this is a verbal model. A new preprint on bioRxiv has posted a formal model that outlines the different parameters that shape the trajectory of this decoupling between phenotype and ancestry. [Assortative mating and the dynamical decoupling of genetic admixture levels from phenotypes that differ between source populations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/773663v2):

There are a lot of words and math. It’s quite gnarly. **But the figure at the top of the post shows the major effect.**

Basically:

– loci in a trait (e.g., height) means that association between ancestry and trait decays more slowly  
– stronger assortative mating of phenotype means that the association between ancestry and trait decays more slowly  
– stronger assortative mating on ancestry means that the association between ancestry and trait decays more slowly

Since historically people did not have individualized genome-wide ancestry results “assortative mating on ancestry” means by physical appearance in the generality. To me panel E above is really what you should focus on. About 10 genes impact the phenotype, and assortative mating is at 0.5 (between 0 and 1.0). You see the correlation is already only \~0.50 between genome-wide ancestry and the trait in about 10 generations.

Anyway, dig into the math. I read the whole thing but didn’t go over the math in detail. The model and simulations make intuitive sense. I’d be curious how they fit empirical results (which are cited in the paper).
