Late Denisovan admixture?

From [A method for genome-wide genealogy estimation for thousands of samples](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0484-x), this section jumped out at me:

The inference of deep structure within Africa is not a great surprise. But note that their estimate for Denisovan admixture is that on the whole, it could be half as old as Neanderthal admixture. I don’t put much stock in the specific estimate of the date, but rather the relative time.
