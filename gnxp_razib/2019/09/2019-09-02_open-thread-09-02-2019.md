[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/worldofrome.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/worldofrome.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GVFSHT4/geneexpressio-20)Today I noticed Michael Grant’s [World Of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GVFSHT4/geneexpressio-20) is on Kindle. It’s a pretty decent survey. If you want a meatier survey, I recally recommend [History of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684159864/geneexpressio-20). But that’s not in print anymore, so you’ll have to get a used copy.

I love contemporary scholars, but they generally don’t write big long surveys aimed at the general audience from what I can see ([SPQR](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1631492225/geneexpressio-20) is an attempt, and it’s an exception).

[What Genetics Is Teaching Us About Sexuality](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/opinion/genetics-sexual-orientation-study.html). I’ve known about this study for a while now. To be honest, I was surprised they found GWAS hits. I will at some point write a blog post about the paper.

[Humans Dominated Earth Earlier Than Previously Thought](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/science/archaeology-earth-anthropocene.html). This seems like the sort of “big” and collaborative science that the historical sciences are going to benefit from in the coming years.

[Amid Italy’s Beauty, a Vista of Decline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amid-italys-beauty-a-vista-of-decline-11567180425). Italians are not having children. They’ve written the ending to their story already.

[Fossil DNA Reveals New Twists in Modern Human Origins](https://www.quantamagazine.org/fossil-dna-reveals-new-twists-in-modern-human-origins-20190829). You should know this…but a write-up in a high-tone science magazine indicates that paradigms are shifting.
