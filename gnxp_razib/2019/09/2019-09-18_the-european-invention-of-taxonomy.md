The European invention of taxonomy?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inventingtheberbers.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/inventingtheberbers.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081225130X/geneexpressio-20)One of the temptations of rejecting Eurocentrism in modern scholarship is to confuse the semantic terms for reality. Europeans have reshaped the semantic landscape over the past few centuries, but that does not mean that what the terms were pointing to did not exist in some form before.

Last year Aeon published [What is the Muslim world? Islamists and Western pundits speak of ‘the West’ and ‘the Muslim world’ but such tribalism is dangerous colonial propaganda](https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-of-a-muslim-world-is-both-modern-and-misleading). This led me to read [The Idea of the Muslim World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWDZGMV/geneexpressio-20). **This book did not convince me that colonialists had invented the Muslim world.**

Rather, the rise of Europe and the West reconfigured preexistent identities and solidarities.

Today, I noticed Aeon published [Race on the mind: When Europeans colonised North Africa, they imposed their preoccupation with race onto its diverse peoples and deep past](https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-west-made-arabs-and-berbers-into-races). The author of this piece also wrote [Inventing the Berbers: History and Ideology in the Maghrib](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/081225130X/geneexpressio-20). The book actually seems somewhat nuanced. That being said, the Aeon piece is focused on Europeans.

As someone who has read a fair amount recently on the Moorish period of Spain, one thing that is obvious and notable is that **ethnolinguistic difference between various Muslim groups.** Though 19th-century Europeans imposed a particularly harsh and brutal taxonomy on other peoples, **the reality is that to engage in taxonomy is human. The Berbers and Arabs in Al-Andalus were divided due to the fact that Berbers were overrepresent military, while the Arabs had the cultural prestige.**

There is an unfortunate trend today to see all past history as a reflection of the present. When you see this, understand that there’s shoddiness…
