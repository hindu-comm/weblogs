I am at a point in my life where I am averse to purchasing physical books. Even after multiple waves of purging I have too many of those. That being said, the Seshat project is only putting [Seshat History of the Axial Age](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0996139567/geneexpressio-20) in physical form to maximize funds getting to the Sesha project.

So I got [Seshat History of the Axial Age](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0996139567/geneexpressio-20) mostly to support the project. Many readers of this weblog are very interested in Seshat and fellow travelers are trying to do. I encourage everyone who can support the project. Twenty years ago Peter Turchin had an audacious vision. Many people were highly skeptical of the possibilities, and I think Peter and his colleagues have come very far indeed.

[The Money Men Who Enabled Adam Neumann and the WeWork Debacle](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-money-men-who-enabled-adam-neumann-and-the-wework-debacle-11576299616?mod=hp_lead_pos12). Capitalism is better than the alternatives. But mistakes will be made.

[Millennials Are Leaving Religion And Not Coming Back](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/millennials-are-leaving-religion-and-not-coming-back/). I am a believer in the robustness of religion as a cultural phenomenon. But adaptation needs to occur for a different equilibrium. In the short-run, all the prognostications in the 2000s that “God is back” were simply wrong. On the contrary, we’re going through more, not less, secularization.

My only comment on the British election is that from the perspective of the Right it seems like **electorally** we’ll see good times in the near future. For various reasons, the Left can’t seem to engage in rational internal self-regulation.

I got [Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465093507/geneexpressio-20) by Tom Holland due to the blurb from Diarmaid MacCulloch, author of [The Reformation: A History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/014303538X/geneexpressio-20). I’ve read books of this sort before and the problem that always crops up is necessity versus sufficiency. Convinced Christians are often already convinced by the necessity of Christianity for all good things.
