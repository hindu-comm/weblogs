The past needs to be graded on its own curve

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/godlessconstitution.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/godlessconstitution.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393328376/geneexpressio-20)As a follow-up to the [below post](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/12/27/the-2020s-the-decade-of-taking-everyone-seriously-but-not-literally/), I want to outline a bit more precisely how I view judgments of the nature of the Founding and Founders. The difficulty is due to the fact that:

1\) The late 18th-century was a profoundly different time

2\) Humans in the late 18th-century were also profoundly proto-modern in some ways

They were different. But not ***totally*** different.

To me, one way to judge the Founders is in the context of their times, which were different in some substantive ways. Below I alluded to the argument made by some modern American evangelical Protestants that the United States was founded as a Christian nation. What does this mean? Though not always explicit, what they mean is that the United States of America was founded as a Christian nation in an evangelical Protestant sense.

There are several issues with this. First, American evangelical Protestantism is hard to understand without the Second Great Awakening, which postdates the Founding by decades. Second, American evangelical Protestantism has to be seen in the context of the sorts of divisions within American Christianity that came to a head in the [Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist%E2%80%93Modernist_controversy). In other words, saying that the United States of America was founded as a Christian nation comes close to being “not even wrong” in the narrow reading. The Founders would not recognize Christianity in American evangelical megachurches, for example.

Though the Deism of many of the Founders is often emphasized, it is probably closest to the mark to assume that most Deist Founders conceived of their religious opinions as an extension, culmination, and rational perfection, of the Christian tradition.

And yet despite all this, the most interesting aspect of the Founding and religion is how detached the republic was from religion. As noted in Jay Winik’s [The Great Upheaval](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SF9YJA/geneexpressio-20) **the establishment of a federal government without an established religion was shocking, revolutionary, and controversial, at the time**. The Founders may have seen themselves as Christian and assumed that the populace would be Christian indefinitely, but their decision to leave the federal government without attachment to a particular religious institution was what was particularly notable at the time. Similarly, today [Elizabeth Cady Stanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton) would seem on the socially conservative side, but during her lifetime she was a firebrand radical, and her writings shifted the discussion in that direction.

Taken out of context, a sliver of a fact can be used to ‘prove’ anything. That’s the style of argumentation fitting a university English undergraduate. A thesis, and a few supporting facts. True understanding comes from appreciating context.
