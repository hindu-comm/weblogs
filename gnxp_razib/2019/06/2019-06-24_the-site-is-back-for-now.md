The site is back… for now

I spent some time trying to lock down the issue with this website. It’s back online again. Apparently, it was getting hit with too many requests and it was taking down the shared host it’s on (CPU problems). I’ve installed a bunch of caching and other features (including blocking bad crawlers).

Hope we’re back in the saddle for a while.
