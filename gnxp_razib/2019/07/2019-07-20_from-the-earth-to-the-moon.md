From the earth to the moon!

> ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.

I suspect Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Probably Charles Darwin. Perhaps Genghis Khan. Due to the likelihoods of demographics, I would bet that more will recall Mao Zedong than Joseph Stalin.

But the men who stepped on the moon, I suspect, will also be known as names. It was a singular accomplishment.

As a subscriber to *The New York Times* I decided to go look at some of the articles from July 1969. I was surprised to find this: [SURVEY FINDS PUBLIC BACKS MOON LANDING](https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/15/archives/survey-finds-public-backs-moon-landing.html?searchResultPosition=4):

> With the Apollo 11 moon mission to start tomorrow, the American people > now favor landing a man on the moon by 51 to 41 per cent, according to > a new poll by Louis Harris published yesterday in The New York Post.

Support was much more equivocal than I would have guessed. The public was quite aware of how expensive it all was.

My own suspicion is that humans will go back to the moon. But I think it will be a private company or an effort led by China. I don’t think our culture has the will to engage in such a task anymore.
