A pretty quick read, and recommended. Two major things that stood out to me:

1.  The importance of the fact that dinosaurs likely were more efficient
    at getting oxygen from the air, like modern birds, than mammals
    (explains their size?). 2.  The description of the cataclasm at the K-T boundary is pretty good.
    Though the author was mildly critical of the
    [story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died)
    in*The New Yorker*on this, it’s a good complement to that.

  
Unless you’ve been sleeping under a rock, [An early dispersal of modern humans from Africa to Greece](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02075-9). There’s a lot of uncertainty in the dating. So don’t take this home, but the plot keeps getting thicker and more muddled.

The idea that Buddhism leads to pacifism is falsified by **almost all of history.** Kind of annoying that Western conceptualizations of Buddhism are foregrounded to such an extent that history is rewritten.
