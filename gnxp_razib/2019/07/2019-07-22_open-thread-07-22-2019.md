Open Thread, 07/22/2019

Fun time sat the ISIR 2019 meeting in Minneapolis. Lots of deviltry, but that’s for the open thread.

I will tell readers that James Lee has more to come after 2018’s [Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3). And Greg Clark has something in the works on the heels of [A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001EQ4OLA/geneexpressio-20) and [The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00HNF5Z96/geneexpressio-20).

Probably the most interesting and but unsurprising empirical result at the conference is that recommendations add pretty much zero toward evaluation possible admittees to graduate school.

There’s an interesting section on **why** the early Christians tended to distribute what became the New Testament in the codex as opposed to scroll form. It’s not totally clear or coherent, but highly informative.

As I noted in [my other weblog](https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/07/21/india-after-gandhi-1-99-kindle-deal/), [India After Gandhi](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07QR79QXF/geneexpressio-20) has a Kindle sale right now. This is not a book without controversy or dispute, but it is probably worth reading nonetheless.

There’s a link within the story with the text [“an increasingly competitive space race”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-shoots-for-the-moon-chasing-influence-closer-to-home-1498210205?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=15&mod=article_inline), that describes the race between China and India. Welcome to the 21st-century.

Basically in Bangladesh educated Hindus experience a “glass ceiling.” For professional or social advancement they have to leave for India, so of course, they do.

[Microsoft’s Cloud Business Drives Record Sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-cloud-business-drives-record-sales-11563481232?mod=hp_lead_pos5). I feel like the 2000s for Microsoft was a bit like the 1990s for Apple, where there was a period where the brand was in sharp decline before its bounce back. While the Silicon Valley firms have been dealing with PR nightmares, Microsoft seems to have stayed under the radar.
