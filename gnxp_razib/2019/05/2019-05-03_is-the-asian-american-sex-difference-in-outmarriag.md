Is the Asian American sex difference in outmarriage due to adoption of girls from East Asia?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-03-15.19.51.jpg?resize=640%2C464&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-03-15.19.51.jpg?resize=640%2C464&ssl=1)](http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml#sthash.3pvXL9Y5.dpbs)

I was revisiting the statistics on intermarriage rates of various Asian American ethnicities on the [Asian Nation](http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml#sthash.3pvXL9Y5.dpbs) website drawn from the 2010 census. And something weird jumped out at me: the absolute number of 1.5 and 2nd generation “Asian American” women of some ethnicities is way higher than for others. For Korean Americans, it’s almost a 1:2 ratio of men to women.

So I looked at the inmarriage rate of various ethnicities by for women, and it turns out that there is a \~0.90 correlation between the rate and the ratio. Basically, **when there is a huge surplus of women to men of the same ethnicity these women tend to marry men of other ethnicities**.

This is not a deep interest of mine, but I do know that the number of girls adopted from many Asian nations tends to exceed the number of boys. Adoptees, in general, are already much more likely to marry out of the racial category that their physical appearance codes, but if there was a massive sex ratio difference that would probably exacerbate the issue.

The main reason I’m posting on this is that there is a huge literature, and lots of talk, about how Asian American men are emasculated, and the issues with regards to interracial dating being unbalanced in this community. I think that that is probably still a valid point, but I’m not sure that the interracial marriage statistics reflect the magnitude of the issue. Rather, perhaps it is just an artifact of adoption patterns and the large representation of adoptees in cohorts for certain ethnicities?
