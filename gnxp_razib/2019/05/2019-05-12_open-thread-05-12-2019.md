[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/koreahistory.jpeg?resize=178%2C283&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/koreahistory.jpeg?resize=178%2C283&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009SKECT8/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=yfMkIVFBg1ffLOFYHjm8Sg&slotNum=16&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)[A History of Korea: From “Land of the Morning Calm” to States in Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009SKECT8/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=yfMkIVFBg1ffLOFYHjm8Sg&slotNum=16&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is very cheap on Kindle right now. Seems less propagandistic (unwittingly to be fair) than some other Korean histories I’ve read. Basically, Korean histories seem less interesting in detaching from nationalism as they’re writing, and it can get grating (everyone has opinions, but you don’t want them leaking through all the time).

If you haven’t, you might want to check out my podcast interview with an [epigeneticists](http://insitome.libsyn.com/the-epigenetics-revolution) who takes a dim view of some of the hype in the field. If you are a geneticist you’ll have all this before of course, whether you agree with it or not.

[Harvard Drops Harvey Weinstein Lawyer as a Faculty Dean](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/us/ronald-sullivan-harvard.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes). A contrary take from Harvard students: [‘With Us or Against Us’: Current, Former Winthrop Affiliates Say Faculty Deans Created a Toxic Environment Stretching Back Years](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/5/10/winthrop-climate/). Basically, some people who I know who were at Winthrop house are telling me that the administration took the move because the protests gave them the opportunity. It’s an interesting epistemological question here for all these ‘culture war’ conflicts. A lot of the time the underlying dynamics are more prosaic and personal than what you might read in the media, but it’s not in anyone’s interest to surface that.

Here’s [reader survey as a .csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90k4ixnn82g836p/Gene%20Expression%202019%20Reader%20Survey%202.csv?dl=0). No big surprises. Though some of you don’t want me to post about *Game of Thrones*. Well, that will a “done” thing soon anyhow. I doubt I’ll be blogging ten years from now when Martin comes out with the next book… (if…)

[Evolution unleashed: Is evolutionary science due for a major overhaul – or is talk of ‘revolution’ misguided?](https://aeon.co/essays/science-in-flux-is-a-revolution-brewing-in-evolutionary-theory). Kevin Laland. The usual response is “niche construction isn’t new.”

[Evaluation of the Diagnostic Stability of the Early Autism Spectrum Disorder Phenotype in the General Population Starting at 12 Months](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2732144?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=content-shareicons&utm_content=article_engagement&utm_medium=social&utm_term=051019#.XNYsiWHqjtY.twitter).

[Shadi Hamid](https://twitter.com/shadihamid/status/1127571637736484865) is getting dragged on Twitter for working with a “Christian Zionist” organization (Shadi disputes the characterization). The weird thing is a lot of the critics are journalists who work for AJ+, which is a [subsidiary of Al Jazeera Media Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Media_Network), which is run by a royal family that rules a Salafi state, Qatar. There are good things and bad things about Qatar. But journalists who work for a techno-reactionary absolute monarchy should perhaps be careful about pointing fingers from their glass houses.

[Asia Bibi: Pakistan’s notorious blasphemy case](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/Asia_Bibi). The utilization of these laws to target minorities by people with **personal disputes** is really familiar, though the consequences are more extreme than what you would see in the West. A lot of the time the public is even tacitly aware of the personal nature of the original dispute, but they back the idea of blasphemy laws so much that innocence is no defense.

New podcast on anthropology and archaeology, [The Arch and Anth Podcast](https://archandanth.com/about-the-arch-and-anth-podcast/).

[Why falsificationism is false](https://necpluribusimpar.net/why-falsificationism-is-false/). Since I know a little philosophy of science I have known that Popper is passe within philosophy of science for a long time. But it is surprising to many scientists.

[Is species a social construct](https://twitter.com/DevoEvoMed/status/1126098428105318400)? Some people have argued that rejecting the species concept by biologists is a [deepity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:deepity). The issue that biologists have is that the public has a different perception of what species are than what biologists have. The public perception derives from folk biology, augmented by stuff like the Bible (species = “kinds”). This drives biologists crazy.

[5-HTTLPR: A POINTED REVIEW](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/). Been hearing this from friends since 2007 or so.

[Variable prediction accuracy of polygenic scores within an ancestry group](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629949v1). Important.

[Pakistani Christian girls trafficked to China as brides](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pakistani-christian-girls-targeted-chinese-brides-62870420). China’s demographic problems are going to leave a huge shadow over Asia.

[Don’t Let Students Run the University](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/camille-paglia-protests-represent-dangerous-trend/588859/) and [Academe’s Extinction Event Failure, Whiskey, and Professional Collapse at the MLA](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190510-academes-extinction-event?key=mi0Bff1vaLHL09_no2Emg10qt7p80aeegQ9TpB5QAj7CR1-6q-W9WwTJh5LxzsF5eE5sNW1ZWEw0VFIzbE5mV0lfRVA3dl9PLUFXM25Wak0zVFExU05vczcwQQ).

[Unraveling ancestry, kinship, and violence in a Late Neolithic mass grave](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/04/30/1820210116). This week’s episode of [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/) will be with two of the corresponding authors of this paper.

[Discovery of ongoing selective sweeps within Anopheles mosquito populations using deep learning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/589069v1). A podcast of [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/) in a few weeks will drop with the last author, Andy Kern. Though we talked about pop-gen and machine learning a lot, the last 15 minutes ended up about the issue of how pop-gen needs to reform itself in terms of large collaborations instead of small competing labs.
