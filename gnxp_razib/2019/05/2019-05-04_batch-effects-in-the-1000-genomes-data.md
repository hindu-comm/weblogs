Batch effects in the 1000 Genomes data?

This is an important preprint, [Legacy Data Confounds Genomics Studies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/624908v1):

While some of these reports have been > replicated in other cohorts, most have been reported only in the 1000 > Genomes Project (1kGP) data.

Despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of high-quality whole genomes sequenced today, the [1000 Genome Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/data/) looms very large as a diverse reference set. As noted in this preprint the sequencing was done a while back, so some of the data is of relatively low coverage (so the variant calls may not be confident). And, I think many of us have seen publications which have left us scratching our heads a little over the years, so this preprint really comes at the right time.
