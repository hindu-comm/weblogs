Having a common name in a post-Dunbar’s number world

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/grooming.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/grooming.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674363345/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=LEcEHdCOSt4osuEwaOAFEg&slotNum=17&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)I’m not sure I believe the model outlined in Robin Dunbar’s [Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674363345/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=LEcEHdCOSt4osuEwaOAFEg&slotNum=17&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). I’m not even sure about the specific details of [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number%20). But, the overall insight, **that the vast majority of human history has been defined by small groups with people you see again and again had an impact on our psychology seems robust.**

The connotations of the very word “stranger” are complex but generally lean to the negative. And I think that makes sense. One of the tasks of cultural norms and values is to figure out a way that strangers can be interacted with in non-zero sum relationships.

All of this is to preface a banal assertion about interaction in day-to-day life if you are a middle-class professional. **I get a lot of emails from people with common names, and it’s a non-trivial cognitive load to figure out if I should pay attention or not**. Names like “David”, “John”, and “Omar” are so common that I’ve actually ignored people I shouldn’t because I didn’t realize it was*that*David or Omar. I’ve almost even responded to the wrong person when two people with the same first name are emailing me at the same time.

In a premodern village or a Paleolithic hunter-gatherer tribe, having a common name on a population-wide scale wasn’t a big deal. The people you would address by name regularly was far less than 100 over a year. But in today’s world, some people have to interface with ten different strangers per day, along with all the “regulars.”

If I was a parent considering names, this would be something that I would take into account. It’s probably not optimal to have a very rare name, because people might misspell it or misremember it, though it will be salient. But having a very common name can also be annoying, to the point where many people with common names now go by their middle name or a nickname. Rather, a familiar but not-so-common name is probably optimal.

To give an example, the name “Dennis” is not too common for people my age (as opposed to “David”). If I get an email from a “Dennis” there is only one or two people it could be.
