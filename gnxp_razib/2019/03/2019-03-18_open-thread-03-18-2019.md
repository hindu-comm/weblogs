My general attitude so far is that I’m skeptical, but the author presents a plausible thesis. Additionally, the book is worth reading because of its engagement with the whole literature in this area. It’s got a good bibliography you can follow-up.

We had Shadi Hamid on the [Brown Pundits podcast](https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/03/19/browncast-podcast-episode-24-shadi-hamid-american-politics-egyptian-politics-being-online/). Really appreciate Shadi’s interest in engaging with a diverse array of people. A real intellectual for our time, and unfortunately all too rare in many places these days (I think Shadi should go on the [Extremely Offline podcast,](https://www.patreon.com/extremelyoffline/posts) even though he is extremely online).

[There’s a Fake Outrage Machine on the Right, Also](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/fake-outrage-machine-right-radical-professors/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_content=5c905bed4b73850001587e9f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter). Basically, they’re trying to get a professor fired for saying in some forum several years ago that cops should be killed. This is egregious, but one of the features of academia, as it is today, is that egregiousness is defended.

Some people are making the analogy to the professor who is under fire at Sarah Lawrence, who wrote an op-ed suggesting there needs to be more intellectual diversity in academia. That’s a pretty weird comparison, but I guess it tells you something. If you are conservative your very existence is scary. If you are on the Left, suggesting people should be killed is scary. But look, there are literal Communists in the academy. No one is demanding they be fired, and unless you add all sorts of caveats being a Communist often means you believe in violent revolution against a class of people. Being liberal in the broad sense is illustrated only when it’s hard, not when it’s easy.

A conservative assault on academia may need to occur, but it shouldn’t be around small things like a professor here and there. Go for the money. That’s the heart. Crazy professors are like stray strands of hair.

[The Stanford professor who rejected one of Elizabeth Holmes’ early ideas explains what it was like to watch the rise and fall of Theranos](https://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-professor-phyllis-gardner-on-theranos-and-elizabeth-holmes-2019-3). If you listened to [The Dropout](http://abcradio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/), you get the feeling that Dr. Phyllis Gardner was the hero we didn’t deserve. It must have been difficult to watch what has happened over the past 15 years for her. She knew it was fake all along.

[Immune Gene Diversity in Archaic and Present-day Humans](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/11/1/232/5253179). Starting to think that the low diversity and population sizes of northern humans were a long-term problem, and one reason they were absorbed by southern modern humans. Not totally sure though.

[The Scandals of Meritocracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/opinion/sunday/the-scandals-of-meritocracy.html). Virtue vs. competence. Would you rather have a boss who is evil but competent, or good but incompetent? The reality is you have to balance the two. Richard Nixon was probably smarter that Dwight Eisenhower in raw *g*, but Eisenhower was probably a better person.

Much of South India is below replacement. Kerala’s fertility is similar to Japan’s. The Gangetic core of North India is well above replacement. The state of Bihar has 100 million people and a total fertility rate of 3.41. That’s similar to Pakistan’s.

[Classic Mechanism of Epigenetic Inheritance Is Rare, Not the Rule](https://www.the-scientist.com/notebook/classic-mechanism-of-epigenetic-inheritance-is-rare--not-the-rule-65511?utm_content=87280434&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-18198832). Some geneticists are in “but we all knew that” mode. But the reality is that going by the popular press the public doesn’t know that. The unfortunate reality is that scientific revolutions don’t come around that often.

[Fooled By Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812975219/geneexpressio-20/) is my favorite Nassim Taleb book.

Graham Coop has released a textbook, [Population and Quantitative Genetics](https://github.com/cooplab/popgen-notes/releases/tag/v1.0). Since I periodically get emails to delete comments from kids in high school and college, I knew younger people read this weblog. I’d recommend a resource like this to see if you are *really* interested in population and quantitative genetics.

Check out the [Population Genomics blog](https://populationgenomics.blog/).
