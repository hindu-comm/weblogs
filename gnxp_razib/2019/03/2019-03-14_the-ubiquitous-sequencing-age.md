The Ubiquitous Sequencing Age

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/genomics.jpeg?resize=180%2C245&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/genomics.jpeg?resize=180%2C245&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198754833/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=ZAF92xkyIgYEE7GsHshhPg&slotNum=0&imprToken=FJpHRPkF1UFq17ZQCrlmWw&slotNum=29&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)Several years ago Yaniv Ehrlich published [A Vision for Ubiquitous Sequencing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/019018v2). We’re inching in that direction. In *The Atlantic* Sarah Zhang has a piece, [An Abandoned Baby’s DNA Condemns His Mother](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/38-years-later-dna-leads-to-teenager-who-abandoned-her-baby-in-a-ditch/584683/), while *The New York Times* just came out with, [Old Rape Kits Finally Got Tested. 64 Attackers Were Convicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/nyregion/rape-kit-tests.html):

> Still, even with such successes, the problem of untested rape kits > persists. Advocates for rape victims estimate that about 250,000 kits > remain untested across the country.

Unfortunately, until recently, the ‘forensic genetics’ employed rather primitive 1990s technology. But that’s changing, though both money and expertise need to be brought to bear. Companies such as [Gencove](https://gencove.com/) and [Othram](https://www.othram.com/) are bringing that expertise to a broader market, with the latter company focusing specifically on the forensic market.

**So ubiquitous sequencing is happening.** Soon. What does that mean? We need to think about privacy. We need to think about data. We need to reflect on the broader implications of this world beyond specific targeted tasks such as forensic identification.
