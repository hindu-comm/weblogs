Anticipating post-postcolonialism

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/destinydisrupted.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/destinydisrupted.jpeg?resize=182%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005EYEPB2/geneexpressio-20)Recently on Facebook, an old friend who is now a professor promoted a new series of essays to which she contributed. She noted that this is a history which “…place enslavement, colonialism, and indigenous removal at the center…” Some of the analyses clearly take [postcolonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism) for granted, **where the contact with and shock of European imperialism are critical to understanding *everything***.

One some level empirically it is impossible to understand the recent history of black Americans or Native Americans without understanding the role that imperialism and colonialism played in shaping their self-understandings, and how they reacted to their oppression. But, on a purely normative level, I wonder if this diminishes the attempt to understand cultures and societies in a positive sense. As in, what defines a people beyond their reaction to other people? To be frank, often the fixation on slavery and genocide by white intellectuals allows these intellectuals to continue to focus on white people as the agents of history.

But even in bondage and subjugation people continued to innovate, create, and flourish. The long recession of the native peoples and nations of the New World in the face of European hegemony was the work of centuries. How many people know that the [last Maya kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804735220/geneexpressio-20) was conquered by the Spaniards in 1697? Or that the [Mapuche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche#Incorporation_into_Chile_and_Argentina) people of southern Chile were fully not conquered until the late 19th-century?

There are whole histories here that could be told which are not nearly as Eurocentric.

But the bigger issue is that outside of the context of the peoples of the New World, who felt the blunt force of European imperialism for centuries and manifested the colonialist experience par excellence, **a postcolonial narrative that foregrounds the agency and action of Europeans may not be fully informative**. The period between 1400 and 1800 is one where Europe became progressively more dynamic and powerful vis-a-vis other regions of the *oikoumene*, but until the very end of this period European powers were often marginal players except in their own imaginations.

After 1800 European hegemony truly took hold, as the Eurasian “gunpowder empires” collapsed, and the interior of Africa was finally opened up to colonization due to quinone. The question then becomes: **does this century or so allow us to understand by and large the course of future history**?

![British rule in 1800](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Map-of-India-1800-AD-Courtesy-peopleofindia1868.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1)

Consider both India and China. India was under direct or indirect British rule in totality by the middle of the 19th-century, though note that even in 1800 much of the subcontinent was under native rule. India and Pakistan were independent by 1947. China began to be impinged by European powers by the 1840s, and then underwent a series of shocks and decentralizations so that it was quasi-colonial by the early 20th-century. Like India, China’s indigenous elite shucked off foreign rule in the 1940s with the victory of the Communists.

But both India and China were strongly shaped by non-indigenous ideologies and currents after independence. China was Communist, while India’s elite was shaped by Fabian socialism. **But today both China and India are arguably shifting toward more self-consciously indigenous modalities**.

For example, Hindu nationalism as an analog to nationalist movements in 20th-century Europe. These analogies are not without merit, but the problem is that often they are taken to extreme correspondences which are highly implausible. To me, it is important to consider the possibility, even likelihood, **that deep indigenous sentiment and sensibilities are resurfacing in these societies as European ascendency recedes**.

If this is the case, then it is important to understand the histories of these people beyond their interaction and engagement with the West. Beyond postcolonialism. Hindu nationalism is far more than fascism in brownface, and Salafism is more than a purely rational reaction to the Western challenge.\* We must move beyond our European schemas to understand the post-European age.

\* Actually, I do think Salafism is impossible to understand without its reaction and engagement with the West, but the impulse is far more ancient and goes back to [Ibn Taymiyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah).
