Napoleon Chagnon, R.I.P.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/noblesavages.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/noblesavages.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006VJN2FE/geneexpressio-20)[Napoleon Chagnon has died](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/science/napoleon-chagnon-dead.html). It is unfortunate that Chagnon is known to many for the fact that he became involved in a [controversy](https://www.salon.com/2000/09/28/yanomamo/) triggered by the activism of a polemical journalist. It will surprise none of the readers of this weblog I agree with [Alice Dreger’s take](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178026/) on the whole issue.

If you want to familiarize yourself with Chagnon, I would recommend [Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes — the Yanomamo and the Anthropologists](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006VJN2FE/geneexpressio-20). It was written at the end of Chagnon’s life, so it summarizes his research and overall views.

I will be frank and state that **I am much more skeptical of the generality of some of Chagnon’s inferences using an evolutionary psychological framework than I was 20 years ago.** If Chagnon’s critics had focused more on the science everyone would have benefited. As it is, they went the easy route with political food fights.

Chagnon asked the right questions, even if I now judge that he came to some wrong answers. Such is science.
