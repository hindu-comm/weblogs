Sorry-not sorry, about the lack of posting. This blog has gone on much longer than I would have thought when I started it back in 2002, but obviously it has to take a backseat to other things in my life now that I’m no longer in my mid-20s.

One of the most interesting facts in [The Cultural Revolution: A People’s History, 1962—1976](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01DNDPPH8/geneexpressio-20) is that **there is only one case of a child turning in their parent on a capital crime for which the parent was executed.** The child is now a middle-aged man and found this out in his adulthood that his was the only validated instance of this occurring.
