The arc of selection on polygenic traits

A very important new preprint, [Polygenic adaptation after a sudden change in environment](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/792952v1):

> Polygenic adaptation in response to selection on quantitative traits > is thought to be ubiquitous in humans and other species, yet this mode > of adaptation remains poorly understood. We investigate the dynamics > of this process, assuming that a sudden change in environment shifts > the optimal value of a highly polygenic quantitative trait. We find > that when the shift is not too large relative to the genetic variance > in the trait and this variance arises from segregating loci with small > to moderate effect sizes (defined in terms of the selection acting on > them before the shift), the mean phenotype’s approach to the new > optimum is well approximated by a rapid exponential process first > described by Lande (1976). **In contrast, when the shift is larger or > large effect loci contribute substantially to genetic variance, the > initially rapid approach is succeeded by a much slower one.** In > either case, the underlying changes to allele frequencies exhibit > different behaviors short and long-term. Over the short term, strong > directional selection on the trait introduces small differences > between the frequencies of minor alleles whose effects are aligned > with the shift in optimum versus those with effects in the opposite > direction. The phenotypic effects of these differences are dominated > by contributions from alleles with moderate and large effects, and > cumulatively, these effects push the mean phenotype close to the new > optimum. Over the longer term, weak directional selection on the trait > can amplify the expected frequency differences between opposite > alleles; however, since the mean phenotype is close to the new > optimum, alleles are mainly affected by stabilizing selection on the > trait. Consequently, the frequency differences between opposite > alleles translate into small differences in their probabilities of > fixation, and the short-term phenotypic contributions of large effect > alleles are largely supplanted by contributions of fixed, moderate > ones. **This process takes on the order of \~4Ne generations** (where > Ne is the effective population size), after which the steady state > architecture of genetic variation around the new optimum is restored.

If you jump to the discussion it frames its importance pretty well. A lot of selection is probably quantitative and polygenic, but a lot of the empirical investigation has been of the sweep of single-locus alleles that rise up to fixation. It strikes me that some of the results here resemble R. A. Fisher’s geometric model of adaptation ([The Genetical Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20) is the first citation).

I read the whole preprint, but I didn’t double-check the formulae. I have neither the ability or the time. **This is where I really which there was a lot of visible post-publication review**. I am very interested in the topic under discussion, but it is outside of the purview of my competency, but I know enough that I would probably benefit from extensive comments by others.

This part of the discussion jumped out at me since it echoes my thoughts:

> Another implication of our results pertains to the search for the > genetic basis of human adaptation, as well as adaptation in other > species. Efforts to uncover the identity of individual adaptive > genetic changes on the human lineage were guided by the notion that > their identity would offer insight into what “made us human”. Under > the plausible assumption that many adaptive changes on the human > lineage arose from selection on complex, quantitative traits, this > approach may not be as informative as it appears (15, 19). Our results > indicate that after a shift in the optimal trait value, the number of > fixations of alleles whose effects are aligned to the shift are nearly > equal to the number of alleles that are opposed (Fig. 6).
