[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20)Just noticed that the [Kindle version](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20) of [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20) is \$4.99. If you haven’t read it, I suggest you do it sooner rather than later.

[The Dark Psychology of Social Networks](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/). Perhaps a little alarmist. One thing is clear is that now most people are on the internet, median conversation is probably not as elevated (people are stupid). But there are structural and cyclical aspects of this. Ecosystems eventually all collapse.

[Population-specific and transethnic genome-wide analyses reveal distinct and shared genetic risks of coronary artery disease](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/827550v1).

[‘I Will Never Be German’: Immigrants and Mixed-Race Families in Germany on the Struggle to Belong](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/reader-center/german-identity.html). In college, I had a philo-German friend whose mother was a German immigrant. His father was a Japanese American. He learned German in college to supplement what he learned from his mother and maternal grandmother (his grandmother was, to be frank, an unrepentant fan of Adolf Hitler). In his junior year, he went to do study abroad in Germany.

When he came back I asked him what he thought, since he had loved the idea of Germany and German culture (he had been into techno). He got angry, and explained he dealt with a lot of casual racism, and people would complain about how many “Chinese people” there were now in Germany around him in German, assuming he didn’t know German (they were complaining about him, as he looked visibly Asian, albeit he did actually favor his mom’s side in appearance). I never asked him about Germany after that.

Glad to see Peter Turchin getting some love. Of his older books, I really recommend [Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B076ZX45Y6/geneexpressio-20). I’ll be honest and that I thought Peter was full of it when he made his pessimistic predictions in 2010. He could be wrong still, but he wasn’t offbase to be worried.

[Human Origins in Southern African Palaeo-wetlands? Strong Claims from Weak Evidence](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201911.0193/v1). Measured response. This is how it should be done.

[Elevated polygenic burden for ASD is associated with the broad autism phenotype](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/838375v1).

[Five Polling Results That May Change the Way You Think About Electability](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/upshot/democratic-polls-battleground-states.html). The fact that socially moderate downscale young Democrats don’t get a lot of “woke” language dovetails with Rob Henderson’s piece, [Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class—A Status Update](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/). Freddie DeBoer wrote something along the lines of language being a way to maintain class privilege many years ago. The eternal rectification of names is the game of gentleman.
