It’s an excellent book. About ten years ago I read an earlier book of his, [The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374531161/geneexpressio-20). The author and I have also corresponded a bit on Burmese genetics (and his own). Anyhow, [The Hidden History of Burma](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07P9DCVP2/geneexpressio-20) is highly recommended (by me and at least).

I posted [admixture coefficients for South Asian Genotype Project members](https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/11/26/some-admixture-coefficients-for-south-asian-genotype-project-members/) at my other weblog (which now routinely gets more traffic than this weblog!).

[Blogs I Read, Researchers I Follow, and Podcasts I Listen To](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/11/blogs-i-read-researchers-i-follow-and.html). Tanner mentions my own work. Also read his post, [Review: Inside the Mind of Xi Jinping](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/11/review-inside-mind-of-xi-jinping.html).

A little something about Albert: though we differ a great deal on political questions and orientations, he has always tried to take my views seriously and engage in good faith. This is rarer and rarer today in our polarized world.

[In Cincinnati Suburb, Some Republicans Are Uneasy About Trump’s Tone](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-cincinnati-suburb-some-republicans-are-uneasy-about-trumps-tone-11574692823?mod=hp_listb_pos2). The story is really interesting for this sentence: “…said she used to call herself a “closet liberal” and refrained from talking politics. But in recent years, she **found she shared political sentiment with more people than she had imagined**.” “Preference falsification” is a lot more common than people in the majority or minority think. See Timur Kuran’s book,[Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674707583/geneexpressio-20).

[Racial Bias in the Sharing Economy and the Role of Trust and Self-Congruence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3434463).

[Chinese Woman Denied a Job in Case of Provincial Prejudice—and She’s Suing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-woman-denied-a-job-in-case-of-provincial-prejudiceand-shes-suing-11574698024?mod=hp_listb_pos1). People from Henan, the traditional seat of ancient Chinese civilization, are stereotyped negatively.

[Why is labor mobility slowing in America?](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/why-is-labor-mobility-slowing-in-america.html) People are settling down.

[A multiple-trait Bayesian Lasso for genome-enabled analysis and prediction of complex traits](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/852749v1).

But I decided to rent this textbook too, [The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00NSTL6BC/geneexpressio-20).

Charles Murray’s new book, [Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07Y82KNS1/geneexpressio-20), is coming out in January.

Some readers may want to check out this [interview](http://brownpundits.libsyn.com/sadanand-dhume-unfiltered) of [Sadanan Dhume](https://twitter.com/dhume?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for the [Brown Pundits Browncast](%22https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/).

Ben Shapiro interviewed [David Berlinski](https://www.podcastone.com/episode/David-Berlinski--The-Ben-Shapiro-Show-Sunday-Special-Ep-78). Listening to Berlinski is weird, because he seems to have not moved mentally into the 21st-century. He seems rather hale for someone born in 1942 (he mentions his age), but at the end of the day, Steven Pinker is not the enemy of David Berlinski. Pinker wants to convince through persuasion. There are now people who want to put people like Shapiro and me into reeducation camps. Those are the True Enemies.

The day will come when the evangelical Protestant and the New Atheist wills stand shoulder to shoulder facing massed formations of Critical Theory orcs. And one will say to the other, “I never thought I’d die next to an Elf.”

He would do great on Twitter! He also has a book out, [Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07Z43L655/geneexpressio-20). It’s really weird how much time he spends attacking Steven Pinker.

Tad Williams is back in Osten Ard with [The Witchwood Crown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IAUG3FM/geneexpressio-20). Williams’ Elf-analog people are well done. They occupy a behavior “uncanny valley.” Human-like, but definitely not human.

[Intra-Species Differences in Population Size shape Life History and Genome Evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/852368v1). The abstract is not surprising.

[Increased ultra-rare variant load in an isolated Scottish population impacts exonic and regulatory regions](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008480).

[Leaked China Files Show Internment Camps Are Ruled by Secrecy and Spying](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/leak-chinas-internment-camps.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

[An interview with historian James McPherson on the New York Times’ 1619 Project](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/11/14/mcph-n14.html). The 1619 project is kind of like [David Barton’s books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Barton_(author)) about how the United States was founded as a fundamentally Christian nation. Basically you start with an ideological wish, and you fulfill it by hook and by crook.

[Model-based inference of punctuated molecular evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/852343v1).

[A comparison of humans and baboons suggests germline mutation rates do not track cell divisions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/844910v1). This is a very important preprint.

[Approximating the coalescent under facultative sex](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/846568v1).

I find a lot of ebooks using [Bookbub](https://landing.bookbub.com/covers_ext_scrolling/?source=ga_bookbub_exact&gclid=Cj0KCQiAt_PuBRDcARIsAMNlBdr5fzEiesUFqFw0-2fGijPf92XYQFWj4VSGq_rxhj1uoCx77NEi9GcaAgdlEALw_wcB). More specifically, I find deals. But make the settings a little loose so you see random stuff too.

Any recommendations on a history book for children? Asking for a progeny. I really liked [A Child’s History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/160796533X/geneexpressio-20) when I was seven.
