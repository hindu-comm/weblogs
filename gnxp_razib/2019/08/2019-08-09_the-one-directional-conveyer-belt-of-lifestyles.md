The one directional conveyer belt of lifestyles?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/theinsight.jpeg?resize=224%2C224&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/theinsight.jpeg?resize=224%2C224&ssl=1)](http://insitome.libsyn.com/)Though we are taking a hiatus for the summer for [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/) podcast, we have many episodes already recorded and ready to go. The current plan is to launch season 3 with a discussion between Spencer and myself on the [Tocharians](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/07/26/the-yamnaya-origins-of-the-tocharian/).

One of the things I brought up is an observation about the changing lifestyles of proto-Tocharians and post-Tocharian peoples. It seems likely that the proto-Tocharians, the descendants of the Afanasevio people, were pastoralists. At some point, they settled down in the oases around the Tarim Basin. And, they became city-dwellers. Eventually, they were conquered by the Uygurs. They too were pastoralists, and they settled down to become city dwellers. The Uygurs were eventually conquered by other Turks, who also became city dwellers.

To my knowledge, the shift from pastoralism to a sedentary lifestyle seems to be far more common than the other way. Pastoralist peoples conquer sedentary peoples…and in their turn settle down, and are conquered by later pastoralists. Meanwhile, hunter-gatherers, such as Mongolians and Australian Aboriginals, adapt to pastoralism quite well.
