Between Terence and incommensurability

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/terence.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/terence.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199556032/geneexpressio-20)One of my favorite quotes is from the Roman playright Terence. He asserted: *Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto*. I know of it through the English translation, “I am human, and I think nothing human is alien to me.”

This truth was brought home to me in the early 2000s when I read Scott Atran’s [In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20). Atran has a long section where he critiques a dominant mode of analysis and interpretation within American cultural anthropology **which emphasizes differences in cognitive frameworks and paradigms, to the point of incommensurability**. The simplest reduction of Atran’s critiques are that the logical conclusion of this line of thinking would make even the interpretive scholarship of this school of cultural anthropology totally worthless.

Consider the discussion about democratic forms of governance. One can assert, with credibility, that the Greeks “invented” democracy. **But, I think this masks the reality that the democratic impulse existed across many cultures and societies** (e.g., the [republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic#Indian_subcontinent) of ancient India). The Greeks had a genius for systematizing and formalization of social and political structures. But the basic elements and dynamics were already there.

Similarly, people are wont to say that one can’t understand Chinese or Indian religion from the Western perspective of religion. I understand where people are coming from when they say this (and in fact, it’s not a “Western perspective,” but often a post-Calvinist confessional Protestant conceptualization that they have in mind as “Western”), but the reality is that the broader category of religious phenomena is easy to identify. That is the reason that Portuguese Catholics initially though Indian Hindus were Christian. It is the reason that the Chinese and Japanese in the 16th century often confused Roman Catholicism with a sect of Pure Land Buddhism. Religions differ a great deal across cultures. But they are pretty recognizable.

But there is the reverse side to this equation: **thinking that you understand the psychology of others so well that you misconstrue their motives and intentions**.

Two concrete examples come to mind. My liberal friends often talk about conservatives in ways that seem totally wrong-headed, but, they behave as if they understand the conservative mind as experts, despite not knowing any conservatives besides myself or reading much about conservatives in a way that takes ethnography seriously. There is some evidence that liberals, [in particular](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092), have problems modeling conservative motivations, but the issue is general and not specific to any ideology.

To illustrate this, on the [Say Goodnight Kevin](https://www.youtube.com/saygoodnightkevin) YouTube channel, there is an analysis of Christian\* films and media from a skeptical perspective. Kevin himself is an evangelical Christian who was homeschooled. One of his major criticisms is that in evangelical Protestant Christian media nonbelievers, especially atheists, are depicted in a way that is totally unrealistic, and in keeping with the prejudices of evangelicals about the low moral character and motives of nonbelievers.

Obviously, there is a spectrum here. Humans are not total islands from each other. The limits of my comprehension are not the limits of my culture. But neither are cultural and subcultural norms and idioms so transparent that one can always make very precise and deep inferences about the intentions of outgroups. Any analysis of human psychology and culture must always wrestle with this reality.

\* “Christian” here refers to the American evangelical Protestant subculture.
