Millennials turn away from Creationism

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/thecreationists.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/thecreationists.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674023390/geneexpressio-20?imprToken=n6qDh5pc5OQdccY5pS1oJg&slotNum=0&imprToken=r2BybiXlYXpPxc8Hm9ELHw&slotNum=0&imprToken=A9YAqD8rbSj4gZ3zqr.wJg&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0)When I was younger dealing with Creationists was something I had to do as a matter of course. Like many members of “Generation X” I haunted Usenet groups in the 1990s where the “evolution-creation” debate raged, always defending the consensus science from detractors. Even in the early years of this weblog, we tackled Creationists now and then. It was something you had to do.

But over the past decade or so there has been a change in the air. American society has become more secular, and religious conservatives do not wield as much power. Acceptance of evolution has been increasing, simply due to secularization. Books like [The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674023390/geneexpressio-20?imprToken=n6qDh5pc5OQdccY5pS1oJg&slotNum=0&imprToken=r2BybiXlYXpPxc8Hm9ELHw&slotNum=0&imprToken=A9YAqD8rbSj4gZ3zqr.wJg&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0), seem to be artifacts of the 20th century, dealing with the concerns of a bygone age.

I haven’t read a piece of apologia for Intelligent design since the 2000s, and it’s rather strange **because we have so much data now due to genomics.** Many of the old arguments that Intelligent Design advocates deploy ring hollow and theoretical because the data refute them. People like [David Klinghoffer](https://evolutionnews.org/author/davidk/) are beneath notice.

It is true that a minority of the population rejects evolution on cultural grounds. But as with the rejection of gay marriage, the broader society has moved on to other concerns. “Darwin’s enemies on the Left” are far more vocal and powerful than those on the Right. I can’t imagine an organ of mainstream secular conservatism such as *The Weekly Standard* publishing something like [Evolutionary Psychology and Its True Believers](https://www.weeklystandard.com/andrew-ferguson/evolutionary-psychology-and-its-true-believers) today. At the time it struck me as a coalitional sop to evangelicals.

To explore the demographics of this situation more closely, I took the General Social Survey, looked at the EVOLVED variable from the year 2010 and later. This question asks respondents if they think “humans developed from animals.” It’s true or false, **so I’m presenting the results for “true.”**

What is immediately clear is that a move away from the special creation of human beings, as opposed to common descent, **is occurring among most demographics among Millennials.** Even self-described “fundamentalists” show a shift from older generations to Millennials!
