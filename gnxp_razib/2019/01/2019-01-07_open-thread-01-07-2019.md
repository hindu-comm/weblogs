For example, [The Roman Empire and the Silk Routes: The Ancient World Economy and the Empires of Parthia, Central Asia and Han China](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MA3TAQ5/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=kSvGv8uHd-7SG7SGCjMLeg&slotNum=177) is now \$1.30 on [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MA3TAQ5/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=kSvGv8uHd-7SG7SGCjMLeg&slotNum=177). This is like when [The Shape of Ancient Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=kSvGv8uHd-7SG7SGCjMLeg&slotNum=177) was steeply discounted a few years ago. The prices go up and down. But definitely a boon to any nerd.

It is highly likely I’ll try a leaky gated model for this weblog next month as a trial. I’ll try and set it up so a few extended entry posts are free so links from high-traffic sites aren’t impacted (I don’t see gating posts which aren’t extended entry). If it doesn’t work, perhaps I’ll try something else, or, just sunset the blog. There are enough posts that there is still value even if this becomes an archive website.

Twitter is toxic to discussions with any subtletyor depth are pretty. People are polarized. It’s a great place to get links to papers. But not a great place to have a discussion except on a subset of very narrowly delimited topics.

[China Targets Prominent Uighur Intellectuals to Erase an Ethnic Identity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-intellectuals.html). Looks like China wants all its citizens to become Han.

One of the major biases of the “chattering” classes is that they are drawn from the upper socioeconomic strata. And those that aren’t, tend to be conscientious and studious in relation to the average American.

[The Myth of Drug Expiration Dates](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myth-of-drug-expiration-dates). “News you can use.” This is usually on a list of “things doctors know that you don’t.”

Props to *Vox* for putting a form of the Price Equation in the text! Oren Harman’s book [The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003R7L91C/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=kSvGv8uHd-7SG7SGCjMLeg&slotNum=177) is highly recommended. I had drinks with Harman and George Price’s daughters in Berkeley about eight years ago. Unfortunately, it is clear Price’s personal life was a total mess in ways that aren’t totally communicable in books. It’s particularly interesting comparing Harman’s fuller picture with the George Price that you get to know in [Defenders of the Truth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198505051/geneexpressio-20?imprToken=7BNL1V5hGwESHa48WYHucg&slotNum=4&imprToken=7djkpZFu8lrfIFrOn4-3AQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=kSvGv8uHd-7SG7SGCjMLeg&slotNum=177), which was refracted through William D. Hamilton’s recollections.

My Mom](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/technology/apple-iphone-replacement-mom.html). Smartphones are utilities now. When was the last time you upgraded your microwave? There are lots of things in computing which are like this now. Until it breaks, why get a new computer, tablet, or smartphone?
