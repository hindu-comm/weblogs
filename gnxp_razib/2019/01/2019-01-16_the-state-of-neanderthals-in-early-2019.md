The state of Neanderthals in early 2019

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005XMK898/geneexpressio-20)*PNAS* has published a paper, [Limits of long-term selection against Neandertal introgression](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/01/14/1814338116). It’s from a preprint which [I blogged this summer](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/07/04/what-neanderthals-tells-us-about-modern-humans/). What are the major takeaways here?

It’s been about 10 years since the draft Neanderthal genome was published. At around that time everyone realized that there was archaic introgression into the modern human genome. More precisely, reticulation in the human phylogeny was a major thing in the time scale of 50,000 years and earlier.

But there were a lot of details to clear up. For example:

1.  Did % Neanderthal admixture vary outside of Africa? 2.  Was there really only one single admixture? 3.  Has natural selection shaped the proportion of Neanderthal genetic
    material in our genomes?

1.  Neanderthal % is Europe is no different than Asia, rather, there is
    West Eurasian gene-flow into Africa 2.  Selection against Neanderthal genes seem to have occurred very
    early, and little later one 3.  Selection seems to be strong around regulatory elements 4.  The lack of variation due to basal Eurasian admixture indicates they
    may have been part of the admixture

This is not the final world. Rather, it illustrates that though the first pass result stands, a lot of details are being worked out, and that this dynamic field is sensitive to the samples available and theoretical frameworks that leverage those samples.
