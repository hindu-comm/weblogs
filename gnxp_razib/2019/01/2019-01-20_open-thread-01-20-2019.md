It’s dry. But good. It is also one of those academic books where thecost of the [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07BNT9W3K/geneexpressio-20?imprToken=A9YAqD8rbSj4gZ3zqr.wJg&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0) version is \$50 less than the hardcover version.

[Two for Tea](https://soundcloud.com/user-761174326) is a good podcast. One the most recent one they interviewed two anthropologists, both known to me. It was a nerdy but informative conversation and convinced me to not take up [Sex at Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004ADQAPM/geneexpressio-20?imprToken=A9YAqD8rbSj4gZ3zqr.wJg&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0)(it’s in my stack).

We’ve got 9 episodes now on the Brown Pundits podcast, the [BrownCast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/brown-pundits/id1439007022?ls=1). The latest is on [Sanskrit](https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/01/21/browncast-episode-9-conversation-on-indo-aryan-linguistics/). The current plan is to range over a lot of topics. If you have ideas, shoot them my way.

People have been asking about my other podcast, [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2). It will be back soon!

I really recommend them.
