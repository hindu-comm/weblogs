[![1984-Big-Brother](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1984-Big-Brother.jpg?resize=180%2C257)![1984-Big-Brother](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1984-Big-Brother.jpg?resize=180%2C257)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B018TVAAGU/geneexpressio-20)I’m reading [1984](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B018TVAAGU/geneexpressio-20). Incredible how well it anticipated the behavior of the Cultural Revolution. Yes, I’ve read [Brave New World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JTYQJ3K/geneexpressio-20), and have just purchased [Fahrenheit 451: A Novel](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0064CPN7I/geneexpressio-20).

*The New York Times* has a two part series on the decision to overthrow Gaddafi and Hillary’s involvement in it: [Hillary Clinton, ‘Smart Power’ and a Dictator’s Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/hillary-clinton-libya.html), and [A New Libya, With ‘Very Little Time Left’](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/libya-isis-hillary-clinton.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news). I’m not a big fan of Barack Obama, but I appreciate his cautious and indecisive pattern in foreign policy. If we learn anything from George W. Bush’s presidency it’s that boldness can have long term consequences which we can’t foresee. It seems likely that Hillary will be president at this point, so we’re going back to neocon-lite liberal internationalism in all likelihood.

It’s 2,000 pages. But the [Kindle edition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007XJ77QG/geneexpressio-20) is still only \~\$20. Pretty good.

Though their 30x sequences are [\$1,650](https://www.fullgenomes.com/purchases/5/?), their 2x is [\$280](https://www.fullgenomes.com/purchases/10/?). Now 2x may seem useless, but 35% of my readers have already done genotyping, so perhaps they can squeeze more juice out of combining the two data? The world we live in in terms of options….

I’m going to finally try and push out some non-blog content in the near future, so please remember to subscribe to my [total content feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan).

[Warriors of the Cloisters: The Central Asian Origins of Science in the Medieval World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691155313/geneexpressio-20) is a much more compact book than [Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691150346/geneexpressio-20). Recommended, though I’m not that convinced by the thesis proffered in the subtitle, there’s a lot of interesting information in the book which will be fodder for a future post. Also got Valerie Hansen’s [The Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0190218428/geneexpressio-20), but who knows when I’m going to get to that?
