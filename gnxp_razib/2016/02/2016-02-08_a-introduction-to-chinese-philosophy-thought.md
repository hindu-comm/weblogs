A introduction to Chinese philosophy? (thought)

[![51ryboe8q7L.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/51ryboe8q7L._SY344_BO1204203200_-180x300.jpg?resize=180%2C300)![51ryboe8q7L.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/51ryboe8q7L._SY344_BO1204203200_-180x300.jpg?resize=180%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684836343/geneexpressio-20)A young friend of mine was asking for recommendations on an introduction to Chinese philosophy. [Xunzi: The Complete Text](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M//geneexpressio-20) would be hard going for him I suspect, as he has minimal background. My inclination is to suggest [A Short History of Chinese Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684836343/geneexpressio-20). My personal experience (yes, I’m still slogging through the medieval section of [A New History of Western Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199656495/geneexpressio-20)) is that a narrative historical framework makes the abstruse nature of philosophical reflection go down a bit easier.

If you want to get primary sources (translated obviously), [Sources of Chinese Tradition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231109393/geneexpressio-20) would be a good bet, but it’s probably too much without having any reference points. Any thoughts from readers? [T. Greer](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/) can probably help here….
