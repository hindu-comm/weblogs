Happy Darwin Day! Now read some Fisher….

[![41L69h9XdRL.\_SX331_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/41L69h9XdRL._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)![41L69h9XdRL.\_SX331_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/41L69h9XdRL._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20)It’s [Darwin Day](http://blogs.nature.com/aviewfromthebridge/2016/02/12/darwin-day/). I’m a little ambivalent about the sort of cultishness that sometimes accrues to Charles Darwin. But it is probably a phenomenon that only makes sense in light of the culture war started by evolution-rejectionists. But there is reason to be optimistic on this; according to the GSS young people tend to be more accepting of evolutionary theory. And I was intrigued by these [Pew data](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/12/darwin-day/) which indicate that a substantial minority of religious people accept a naturalistic evolutionary model! (Muslims have a high fraction of this element, **and**, of Creationists, indicating that this is a particularly heterogeneous group)

I’m gratified that \~40 percent of my readers have read [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451529065/geneexpressio-20). But, I’m a bit concerned that only \~8 percent have read [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20) (though one more than [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IVHCTOY/geneexpressio-20)). Darwin is important, but for the stuff that is more the bread & butter of this weblog, I think R. A. Fisher is probably more relevant. That is, an analytical and formal understanding of evolutionary process. With that in mind I would recommend that if you can afford it, get a hardcover [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20) with the forward by J. H. Bennett. Otherwise, read the [original version online](https://archive.org/details/geneticaltheoryo031631mbp). Focus on the first half, and understand that Fisher was not God, so it’s *how* he conceived of a problem, not his particular solution, that’s useful (he was wrong on dominance it seems for example).
