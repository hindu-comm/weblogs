It’s a major pet peeve of mine that people deduce from what they see on this blog and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan) to generate a full picture of whom I am. If the data you saw were representative, then that might be one thing, but they really aren’t. Rather, they’re strongly biased.

A long time reader (as in, back to the ScienceBlogs days) is someone who I now socialize with semi-frequently. One observation he makes is that I tend to engage in more unguarded bloviating in real life. That sounds about right. **In real life everything I say is not recorded for posterity.**

The basic insight thought is that there is much you don’t see when you consider just what you see.

When people engage in others, they use theories to fill in the background of their interlocutors. It’s pretty impossible not to do so. On the other hand, theories are always imperfect, and you shouldn’t get surprised when those who you theorize about are angry when your theories miss the mark.

One way that my “non-internet” and internet personas do align well is that I’m rather aggressive. If think you’ve mischaracterized me, I won’t be happy in person, or online.

I read [Foucault: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192805576/geneexpressio-20) on a plane last week. I have the “very short introductions” series a great deal (have also read [Hegel](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019280197X/geneexpressio-20)). It strikes me they’re good to orient and refresh you before a deeper dive.

A commenter below dismissed the importance of the genealogy of intellectuals and their movements in comparison to mass culture. **But reading [Foucault: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192805576/geneexpressio-20) you see clearly the lexical armamentarium on display decades before it would percolate to Facebook threads and MSNBC.**

I read Said about 15 years ago, but dismissed the work. My objection? **It was simply wrong on many facts.** In hindsight, it strikes me that I was naive in regards to what people admired about Said’s work, and its significance. That is, it’s importance was not as a narrative about the historical past, but possibilities for narrative frameworks relevant for organizing the political present.

[Campus debate on Black Lives Matter called racist, shut down by protesters (VIDEO)](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/29212/). If state campuses are to be thought of as arms of the Left-progressive movement in America, I can’t see any reason for states where the majority of the population is not Left-progressive to continue funding them.
