Game of Thrones spoiling A Song of Ice and Fire

[![51OMI4Jez3L.\_SX260\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51OMI4Jez3L._SX260_.jpg?resize=260%2C241)![51OMI4Jez3L.\_SX260\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/51OMI4Jez3L._SX260_.jpg?resize=260%2C241)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345535529/geneexpressio-20)I finally “broke” last year, and began watching [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01HKAXMPM/geneexpressio-20), the HBO show. As a longtime reader of the [series](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345535529/geneexpressio-20) I had held out hope that [The Winds of Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter) would come out early enough not to be spoiled by the series, but it was not to be. In fact, it is probably likely that [that book will come out *after*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter#Publication_date) next season.

Say whatever you will about the “fork” between the television series and the books, **Benioff and Weiss have made it clear that they know the conclusion, and that they’ll tie the threads back together broadly in line with the books.** That means unless Martin engages in a major course correction, we’ll know conclusion of the series years before last book.

I began to watch the show because it was pretty much impossible to avoid spoilers on Twitter as they began to push the story forward rapidly. What’s the point in waiting another ten years? But that also means that I now have access to other material which can spoil the show: **below the fold is footage of the actors in what is clearly a very important scene.** The scene brings together two characters who are so important that I have a hard time believing that this is a major difference between the book and the television show. It is entirely likely that this scene occurs in the book in some form. It isn’t an entirely unlikely occurrence, but, it still brings into realization what was only a probability.

If you want to be spoiled, click below the fold. Even if you don’t want to be spoiled, it will happen. If you haven’t read the book and are waiting on George R. R. Martin to finish, probably a good time to [read all the books that are out](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345535529/geneexpressio-20) and hope *Winds* comes out shortly.
