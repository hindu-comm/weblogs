Razib Khan at the center of Eurasia

[![Razib_Khan](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Razib_Khan.png?resize=625%2C341)![Razib_Khan](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Razib_Khan.png?resize=625%2C341)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Razib_Khan.png)  
The [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2016/11/fund-raising-offer-basal-rich-k7-global.html) blog is running a fundraiser. I chipped in mostly to support his continued blogging. I don’t agree with everything he posts, but the site is a good and valuable resource. “Genome blogging” hasn’t gotten as far as I’d have thought it would have in 2010, mostly because the initial burst of enthusiasm wasn’t followed up by a consistent **producer** community (in addition to the commentariat). But [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2016/11/fund-raising-offer-basal-rich-k7-global.html) soldiers on….

I wasn’t super interested in this because I know a fair amount about my genotype, and the analysis isn’t too informative for someone like me who is \>10% East Eurasian. But I thought I would post the PCA because it’s interesting. It’s hard to see in the image above (click it for a larger version), but you notice that I am almost equally positioned between the antipodes of Eurasia (Western Europeans vs. East Asians). Most South Asians occupy a position in between, but definitely skewed toward West Eurasians (the green). **But you notice I’m nearly the most “eastern” of the main cluster of South Asians**. Depending on how you calculate it I’m between 10% and 20% East Eurasian. This “pulls” me in that direction more than almost all other South Asians. Like a colossus I look east, and I look west, and stand athwart Eurasia bridging the gap.

In any case, if you have \$12 to spare, think about donating to [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2016/11/fund-raising-offer-basal-rich-k7-global.html). Logistics are at the link.
