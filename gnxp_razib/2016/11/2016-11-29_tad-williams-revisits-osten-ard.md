Tad Williams’ revisits Osten Ard

[![heart_of_what_was_lost_tad_williams](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/heart_of_what_was_lost_tad_williams.jpg?resize=221%2C333)![heart_of_what_was_lost_tad_williams](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/heart_of_what_was_lost_tad_williams.jpg?resize=221%2C333)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/075641248X/geneexpressio-20)Tad Williams has a new book set in Osten Ard, [The Heart of What Was Lost](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/075641248X/geneexpressio-20). At only 224 pages it seems more like a novella compared to what he produced for his original series. The last of that of that trilogy, [Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20), [To Green Angel Tower](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20), weighed in at more than 1,000 pages in the original print hardcover edition (of course it was split in two for paper back).

People are talking about how [Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20) was an inspiration for series such as [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20). First, Williams finished the series in three books. So that’s a huge difference. [Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20) produced large narratives on a per publication basis, but the story was relatively spare compared to what people are attempting now (Brandon Sanderson’s [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003P2WO5E/geneexpressio-20) is already coming out with 1,000 pages books in a projected ten book series). Additionally, William’s world-building was relatively thin and superficial, while the ultimate resolution of the plot threads of [Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20) struck me as a bit cliche and pat.

This is not to denigrate what Tad Williams achieved with [Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn Book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002SV37EA/geneexpressio-20). But to be honest I think the past generation has seen huge changes in epic fantasy. Whether for the worse or better, that is up to you….
