Based on a few minutes scanning online. Also, I suspect that Trump supported is being overestimated. Low confidence that I’m adding value with my opinion.

After finishing [Unfinished Empire: The Global Expansion of Britain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009SJZR4S/geneexpressio-20) I’m struck by the fact that the author had to make some criticisms of Edward Said’s [Orientalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039474067X/geneexpressio-20), because [Orientalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039474067X/geneexpressio-20) is so weak on both details and overall theoretical framework. That’s why I dismissed it fifteen years ago when I read it, but today I have to say that [Orientalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039474067X/geneexpressio-20) is the model of scholarly sophistication compared to what prevails today in postcolonial theory.
