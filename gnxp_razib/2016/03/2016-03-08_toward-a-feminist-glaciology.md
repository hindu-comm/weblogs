Toward a feminist glaciology?

![1280px-Baltoro_glacier_from_air](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1280px-Baltoro_glacier_from_air.jpg?resize=600%2C450)![1280px-Baltoro_glacier_from_air](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1280px-Baltoro_glacier_from_air.jpg?resize=600%2C450)I was pretty skeptical that this paper in *Progress in Human Geography*, [Glaciers, gender, and science: A feminist glaciology framework for global environmental change research](http://phg.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/08/0309132515623368.abstract), was real. But at [Reason](https://reason.com/blog/2016/03/07/this-university-of-oregon-study-on-femin) Robby Soave confirms that this isn’t a hoax (e.g., apparently the research was founded through an NSF grant). The University of Oregon even put out a [press release](http://around.uoregon.edu/content/glaciers-melt-more-voices-research-are-needed):

> “The root of this paradigm comes from the era of Victorian Imperialism > in which manly vigor and scientific discovery provided the dominant > way of both understanding and dominating foreign spaces,” Rushing > said. “This results in a total lack of consideration of alternative > ways of understanding glacial ice, which is especially troubling in > the current age of rapid melt.” >
> … >
> “We do a lot of modeling and study satellite images, but what if we > look at literature, at art, at drawings and recordings of glaciers?” > Carey said. “We need to be looking at the cultural lenses on how > people describe and talk about their landscape.” >
