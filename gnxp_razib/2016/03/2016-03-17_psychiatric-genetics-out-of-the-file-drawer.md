Psychiatric genetics out of the file drawer

I’ve been rather bearish on candidate gene studies of human behavior (e.g., “hug gene” or “violence gene”) since 2007. The reason being the influence of friends who warned me that a lot of false positive results were being published because they could be published. Basically you might have one group publish on a plausible candidate gene, and other groups would follow up and publish **only** when p \< 0.05, neglecting all the null results.

I'm a believer that much of variation in behavior has a biological basis in terms of variation in genes. **But I’m a believer in robust and replicable science which I have faith in.** With that, [Is there a publication bias in behavioral intranasal oxytocin research on humans? Opening the file drawer of one lab](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.12384/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle):

> The neurohormone oxytocin (OT) has been one the most studied peptides > in behavioral sciences over the past two decades. Primarily known for > its crucial role in labor and lactation, a rapidly growing literature > suggests that intranasal OT (IN-OT) may also play a role in humans’ > emotional and social lives. However, the lack of a convincing > theoretical framework explaining IN-OT’s effects that would also allow > to predict which moderators exert their effects and when, has raised > healthy skepticism regarding the robustness of human behavioral IN-OT > research.
