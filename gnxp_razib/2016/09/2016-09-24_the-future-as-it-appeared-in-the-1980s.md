The future as it appeared in the 1980s

Airports are in interesting window into architecture and perceptions of the future. When I landed at [Vienna International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_International_Airport) in 2010 it was as if I landed back in the 1970s. In contrast, [Frankfurt Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Airport) was the closest I’ve felt to really be pushed into the “gleaming future” you sometimes see in science-fiction films.

With that in mind, lately I’ve been thinking that for some reason the airport at [Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Metropolitan_Airport) reminds me of what the future was going to be like in my childhood of the 1980s.
