[Parents Didn’t Just Dislike Super Nintendo 25 Years Ago—They Thought It Was a Scam](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/super-nintendo-25/). Fun fact: I stopped playing video games when I was 16. Mostly because it was taking up too much of my time. This means that I’m excluded from a lot of conversation and pop culture. So be it.

Excited to be going to [ASHG 2016](http://www.ashg.org/2016meeting/). Is Vancouver really part of Canada? Isn’t it like Seattle with a queen? In any case, the abstracts aren’t online yet. They should drop this week….

Taking about five seconds, mine are the following: [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20), [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20), and [In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058RTMXG/geneexpressio-20). The next three? [Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KAH5LMK/geneexpressio-20), [The Genetical Theory Of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KP2B96W/geneexpressio-20), and [From Dawn to Decadence, 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060928832/geneexpressio-20).

It’s often joked that geneticists don’t know real biology, and despite an undergrad background in biochemistry that’s probably somewhat true for me.

Got a copy of [The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-1950](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007CJLZWE/geneexpressio-20). If history is written by the winners, I figured I should get to know the winners a little better!

I was doing most of my Python object-oriented, but everyone kept telling me that I should go functional (online and offline). As I don’t have too much time, I got [Treading on Python Series: Intermediate Python Programming: Learn Decorators, Generators, Functional Programming and More](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BT95CWM/geneexpressio-20).

People have been talking about this for a while. [Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/Embryo%20selection#multiple-selection-on-genetically-correlated-traits) did some real analysis, [Embryo selection for intelligence](http://www.gwern.net/Embryo%20selection#multiple-selection-on-genetically-correlated-traits).

[Tabs Or Spaces – One Billion Files Later An Answer](http://i-programmer.info/news/99-professional/10049-tabs-or-spaces-one-billion-files-later-an-answer.html). Sorry Richard, it’s all spaces all the way….

[5 racist stereotypes that historically were the opposite of what they are today](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/3/12754828/racist-stereotypes-history). Vox is doing well because they’re very cautious about challenging the preconceptions of their readers. Often they reinforce them. Too easy to deconstruct, but please note that stereotypes which might be held about Asians may not be common for certain types of Asians. This sort of banal observation is difficult to make when you are experiencing an orgasm because of the smug-saturation.

I had forgotten this was once \#1 in the early 90s:
