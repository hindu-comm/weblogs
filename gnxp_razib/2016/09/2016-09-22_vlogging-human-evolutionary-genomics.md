Vlogging human evolutionary genomics

[The Estonian Biocentre](http://evolbio.ut.ee/CGgenomes.html) has been one of the best resources in human population genomics, because their policy under [Mait Metspalu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xOPd7N0AAAAJ&hl=en) seems to be to release the data once itâ€™s published. Today I went and checked the site, and noticed a vlog accompanying their *Nature* paper, [Genomic analyses inform on migration events during the peopling of Eurasia](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19792.html).

Well done.
