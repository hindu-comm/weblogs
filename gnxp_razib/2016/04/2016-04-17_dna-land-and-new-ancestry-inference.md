DNA.Land and new ancestry inference

[DNA.Land](https://dna.land/profile/ancestry) has a new [ancestry report](https://medium.com/@dl1dl1/the-new-ancestry-report-f2844384259b#.nrmp0cgp9). Above is my own. I’m pretty aware that designing these consumer-oriented services/applications isn’t easy. But I want to express a little skepticism that two of the three South Asian populations which they used for their “Dravidian” reference are ***not*** Dravidian speaking. In fact, geography and ethno-linguistic affinity in South Asia is only modestly correlated with genetic variation because of caste. Something more generic, such as “South Indian” is what I would have gone with.
