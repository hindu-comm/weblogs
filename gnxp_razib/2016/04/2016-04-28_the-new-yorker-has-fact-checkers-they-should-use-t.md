The New Yorker has fact-checkers, they should use them

![darwin-as-an-old-man-337-450-17](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/darwin-as-an-old-man-337-450-17-224x300.jpg?resize=224%2C300)![darwin-as-an-old-man-337-450-17](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/darwin-as-an-old-man-337-450-17-224x300.jpg?resize=224%2C300)*The New Yorker* has a piece up, [Same but Different: How epigenetics can blur the line between nature and nurture](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/02/breakthroughs-in-epigenetics), which I think on the balance is pretty good. It introduces epigenetics to a broader audience in a manner that’s more than just a catch-phrase, and, cautions that people shouldn’t over-hype what is a legitimately interesting field of science.

But there’s a major factual problem which I mentioned when it came out, and, which some friends on Facebook have been griping about. I’ll quote the section where the error is clearest:

> …Conceptually, a key element of classical Darwinian evolution is that > genes do not retain an organism’s experiences in a permanently > heritable manner. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, in the early nineteenth > century, had supposed that when an antelope strained its neck to reach > a tree its efforts were somehow passed down and its progeny evolved > into giraffes. Darwin discredited that model….

It is true that in *Neo-Darwinian* evolution, the modern synthesis, which crystallized in the second quarter of the 20th century, genes do not retain an organism’s experiences in a permanently heritable manner. But this is **not** true for Charles Darwin’s theories, which most people would term a “classical Darwinian” evolutionary theory. This is because first, Darwin worked in the pre-genetic era. He did not posit particulate inheritance, and had no genetic model. Second, though it is correct that Charles Darwin’s deemphasized the role of acquired characteristics, **he himself was quite open to Lamarckianism in some cases.** This openness persisted into the early 20th century, Ernst Mayr started his career as a Lamarckian!

In the least *The New Yorker* should have had someone with a background in evolutionary biology read the draft. The error is pretty obvious, and easy to fix.
