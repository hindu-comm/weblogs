The Great Ordeal

[![611jQLzlbwL.\_SX338_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/611jQLzlbwL._SX338_BO1204203200_-204x300.jpg?resize=204%2C300)![611jQLzlbwL.\_SX338_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/611jQLzlbwL._SX338_BO1204203200_-204x300.jpg?resize=204%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1468301691/geneexpressio-20)I notice that [R. Scott Bakker](https://rsbakker.wordpress.com/) is finally coming out with a sort-of conclusion to his second trilogy, with [The Great Ordeal](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1468301691/geneexpressio-20). I say sort-of because it seems that his final book in the second trilogy of this planned three trilogy series is going to be one of two, as Bakker submitted a manuscript that was far too long.

Presumably there were issues in relation to the logistics of publishing, because it’s been nearly five years since [The White Luck Warrior](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B010MEQ0Z2/geneexpressio-20). That’s unfortunate, because Bakker’s series really has no parallel in the epic fantasy genre from what I can tell. It leverages standard genre tropes, but introduces a dark philosophic undertone set against the foreground of an incredibly rich and finely crafted world. Much of the brutality in [The Prince of Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing) seems almost gratuitous, but if you want a more antiseptic narrative, there’s always [Brandon Sanderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson).

Bakker’s descriptions of the antagonists threaded throughout his series are chilling, and communicate both menace and mystery. The [Inchoroi](http://princeofnothing.wikia.com/wiki/Inchoroi) are like no other villains I’ve read of in fantasy….
