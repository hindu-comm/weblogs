If maternal stress is a problem, stop stressing pregnant women out!

The screenshot to the left is from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Carolynyjohnson/status/735149604522627072), and shows an alternate title. The article is written by a journalist whose work I normally am appreciate of, but when I saw that I started swearing. There’s just no way that that’s nothing but some spurious correlation. But this research is just too sexy not to write up. It has everything. Inequality. Scientific revolution. And some catchy hooks which relate to American culture (sports).

Mind you, **the fact that Mendelian genetics works as a model should give you a clue as to the reality that epigenetic stress is not ubiquitous in explaining inter-generational variation.** But it doesn’t hurt to have a University of Chicago economist step in to rebut the latest well-meaning moral panics.

Here is the reason I am posting this: **if you actually believe that mild stress has major long-term impacts, why would the media post a piece *that probably induces stress in pregnant women!***
