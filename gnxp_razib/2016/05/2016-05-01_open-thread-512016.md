That being said, I made time to read [The Monkey’s Voyage](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465020518/geneexpressio-20). My main interest was driven by the fact that macroevolution and biogeography aren’t scientific questions which I’ve focused much on lately. But, ultimately the book totally convinced me that [vicariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicariance) doesn’t explain much in terms of geographic patterning of biological variation.

To make it more concrete: **the flora and fauna of New Zealand are not relics of Gondwanaland, but *relatively* recent arrivals due to dispersal.** This is in my opinion rather less romantic than the popular view, but the argument and evidence offered in the book are pretty convincing.
