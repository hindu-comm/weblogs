The gods curse the sin of incest!

It’s a shame most people don’t know more about him. His campaigns against the Persians in the early 7th century were truly audacious. But, he also lived long enough to witness the [loss of Syria and Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius#War_against_the_Arabs). If you haven’t, I would highly recommend [A History of the Byzantine State and Society](https://www.amazon.com/History-Byzantine-State-Society/dp/0804726302?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20).

In any case, I was double-checking the marriage to his niece Martina because of some comments below, and came upon this interesting passage on Wikipedia:

> Martina and Heraclius had at least 10 children, though the names and > order of these children are questions for debate… >
> … >
> **Of these at least two were handicapped, which was seen as punishment > for the illegality of the marriage.**

The coefficient of relatedness between uncles and nieces is 1/4. Twice as close as cousins, and the same as that between half-siblings. It isn’t entirely surprising that debilities would show up at this genetic distance, though two out of ten at that extreme might be a bit high.
