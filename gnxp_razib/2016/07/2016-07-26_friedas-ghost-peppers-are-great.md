Frieda’s ghost peppers are great

![ghost](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ghost1-187x300.jpg?resize=187%2C300)![ghost](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ghost1-187x300.jpg?resize=187%2C300)Recently I was at the supermarket, getting some shrimp at the fish counter. The clerk noticed I had some habanero peppers, and he asked if I’d checked out the ghost peppers. My interest was piqued, but I had no idea what he was talking about. He told me to look at again.

They were [Frieda’s ghost pepper](http://www.friedas.com/ghost-chile/) chilis. My first question: **are these really ghost peppers?** Comparing to the standard orange habaneros you’d get at the supermarket I’d stay these peppers were about three times as spicy. So probably [real ghost peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#Peppers) then. But here’s the great thing: there was a tangy astringency which made them much less bland that mass produced orange habaneros. **The pepper was legitimately delicious.**

The main caution I’d give is that what goes in easily may not come out with grace and comfort.
