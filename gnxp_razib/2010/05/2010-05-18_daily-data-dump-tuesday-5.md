Daily Data Dump (Tuesday)

[Gene Tests For Everyone](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/05/gene-tests-for-everyone/). Probably not much value in most of these tests for most people right now. Also, many of these common variants have been found in subject populations which are European, so if you are Colored it might not tell you anything relevant (i.e., the SNP which is identified as a risk has only been shown to have an effect in Europeans, or, you know you have a trait but it turns out you don’t have any of the “common” variants, perhaps because your population has different variants which are common).

[Return of the Neanderchimps](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/chimpanzees/genetics/neanderchimp-redux-hey-2010.html). Complex demographic history for one and all! I do find the genetic isolation between Bonobos and Common Chimpanzees interesting. Apparently the Congo river was an imposing enough barrier to allow for allopatric speciation. I wonder if this can tell us about the fear our own ancestors might have had in traversing water barriers.

[A New Clue to Explain Existence](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/science/space/18cosmos.html). Physicists can always make themselves look the non-devilish scientists by inserting a reference to God.

[Only Processed Meat Boosts Diabetes And Heart Disease](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/007183.html). Medicine was quackery until the 20th century. Nutritional science seems to be quackery into the 21st.

[The *Microcephalin* Ancestral Allele in a Neanderthal Individual](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010648). No evidence for introgression/admixture at this locus.
