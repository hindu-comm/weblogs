Chickens are like people

In that their demographic history is complicated. [The Origin and Genetic Variation of Domestic Chickens with Special Reference to Junglefowls *Gallus g. gallus* and *G. varius*](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010639):

I wonder if domesticates in particular exhibit these more complex reticulated patterns in their phylogenies because they spread along human trade routes.
