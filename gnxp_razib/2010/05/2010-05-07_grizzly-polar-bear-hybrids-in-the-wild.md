Grizzly-Polar bear hybrids in the wild

Timely, [Pizzly Bears](http://www.slate.com/id/2253332/?from=rss):

> Scientists confirmed last week that a bear shot by an Inuvialuit > hunter in the Northwest Territories is a second-generation > grizzly-polar bear hybrid—a “pizzly” or “grolar” bear.

Not that big of a deal. It is likely that [polar bears are simply a recent derived variant of brown bear](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/03/of-polar-bears-people/). The main issue not noted in the *Slate* piece is that time until last common ancestor isn’t the only parameter to consider. [Placental Invasiveness Mediates the Evolution of Hybrid Inviability in Mammals](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/505162):

For what it’s worth, primates tend toward invasive placentation.
