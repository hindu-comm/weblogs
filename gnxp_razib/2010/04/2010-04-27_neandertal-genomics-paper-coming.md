Neandertal genomics paper coming?

Last week I was [emphasizing the fact that someone from Max Planck](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/04/admixture-between-humans-and-the-others/) seemed to really be positive about the University of New Mexico research which indicates that there has been “archaic” admixture into the modern human lineage derived from Out-of-Africa. This was curious because [Svante Pääbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Pääbo#Work) is at the Max Planck Institute, and he’s reconstructing the Neandertal genome. I wasn’t going to do more than hint at rumors, so I’ll point to [Thomas Mailund](http://www.mailund.dk/index.php/2010/04/24/ancient-admixture/) (after linking to posts on the topic of admixture or not) :

Remember that I didn’t say anything, Thomas Mailund did. Though he wasn’t explicit either, so whatever conclusions you draw are your own. But perhaps a reminder that when people are talking about things in public that might seem curious or a bit farther than the evidence warrants, it may be an issue of you not knowing what they know.
