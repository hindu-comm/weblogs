Daily Data Dump

[Friday Weird Science: Smells Fishy? Check your semen](http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2010/04/friday_weird_science_smells_fi.php). I’m not going to describe the post. You read it (though perhaps not on a full stomach).

[Freeing human eggs of mutant mitochondria](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100414/full/news.2010.180.html). I’m pretty sure this would be banned by the [Orange Catholic Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Catholic_Bible#Teachings).

[Scientists Devise Way to Link Complex Traits With Underlying Genes](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100414152138.htm). At least for some model organisms, though the authors claim at the end of their [paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7291/full/nature08923.html) that they could be transfered to humans.

[Mixed-Race People Perceived as ‘More Attractive,’ UK Study Finds](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100414092523.htm). In general I think these sorts of studies are the inverse of the results of [Charles Davenport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Davenport) on Jamaican mulattoes, scientists sometimes know what findings are congenial to the *Zeitgeist*, and will keep looking until they find them. I suspect there might be *some* effect here, but I doubt much in most non-inbred populations. To me the issue is diminishing returns, the same sort of problem which I think crops up in racialist arguments promoting [ethnic genetic interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Genetic_Interests) (that should even the balance of the scales of Political Correctness). Also, if you accept these results as rooted in heterosis you’d naturally want to compare Eurasians to European/Asian-African mixes, since the former are from much closer populations genetically than the latter, and so would exhibit proportionality more gains.

[Obama, Republicans clash over financial reform](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D1Y020100414). I think this is a case where David Frum’s [half-a-loaf](http://www.frumforum.com/waterloo) is probably wisest; the public is suspicious of Republicans when it comes to financial regulation. This isn’t an entitlement, so Republicans could probably change things in the future anyhow if they had the Presidency and majorities in Congress (though perhaps they’ll make a big stink now so that Wall Street is more positively inclined toward them in terms of political donations).

[Quantum Hustles](http://scienceblogs.com/pontiff/2010/04/quantum_hustles.php). Sometimes science blogging is not going to make intuitive sense.
