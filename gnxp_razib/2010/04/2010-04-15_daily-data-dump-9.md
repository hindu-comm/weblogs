Daily Data Dump

[The Secret of the Banks’ Success](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/the-secret-of-the-banks-success/). 35% of the domestic American profits are now in finance. This much “intermediation” in our economy is like having to service the the enormous parasitic noble class of the Ancien Régime.

[Bad mutations are good for you](https://pleion.blogspot.com/2010/04/bad-mutations-are-good-for-you.html). It’s about fitness landscapes. In [Narrow Roads of Gene Land](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198503369/geneexpressio-20) W. D.

[Retail Sales increase sharply in March](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/04/retail-sales-increase-sharply-in-march.html). The author of the Calculated Risk blog usually presents positive data by offering some skeptical pessimistic commentary.

[Starting from the Beginning: Evolutionary and Developmental Origins of Human Knowledge](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/04/starting_from_the_beginning_ev.php). ScienceBlogs is adding some serious heft.

[APCDD1 is a novel Wnt inhibitor mutated in hereditary hypotrichosis simplex](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7291/full/nature08875.html). Hair loss gene.
