Podcasts about language as a complex adaptive system

For those of you more interested in listening rather than reading, then the journal [*Language Learning*](http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0023-8333&site=1) has [a load of podcasts](http://www.wiley.com/bw/podcast/lang.asp) about language as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system). If you fancy some reading, [here is the position paper](http://www.wiley.com/bw/podcast/LACAS_PositionPaper.pdf) by [the Five Graces group](http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/author/tfggroup.html). Below is the abstract:

> Language has a fundamentally social function. Processes of human > interaction along with domain-general cognitive processes shape the > structure and knowledge of language. Recent research in the cognitive > sciences has demonstrated that patterns of use strongly affect how > language is acquired, used, and changes over time. These processes are > not independent from one another but are facets of the same *complex > adaptive system (CAS)*. Language as a CAS involves the following key > features: The system consists of multiple agents (the speakers in the > speech community) interacting with one another. The system is > adaptive, that is, speakers’ behavior is based on their past > interactions, and current and past interactions together feed forward > into future behavior. A speaker’s behavior is the consequence of > competing factors ranging from perceptual constraints to social > motivations. The structures of language emerge from interrelated > patterns of experience, social interaction, and cognitive mechanisms. > The CAS approach reveals commonalities in many areas of language > research, including first and second language acquisition, historical > linguistics, psycholinguistics, language evolution and computational > modeling.
