Daily Data Dump (Friday)

Hope the weather is good enough where you are that you’ll enjoy the weekend.

[Tories Still Short of a Majority: Hix-Vivyan Prediction up to 26 April](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/election/?p=1820). Trendlines + 95% confidence intervals as shading. What’s not to like?

[Tolerance and Tension: Islam and Christianity in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://pewforum.org/executive-summary-islam-and-christianity-in-sub-saharan-africa.aspx). In 1900 there were 50% fewer Christians than Muslims in Africa. In 1950 there were as many Christians as Muslims in Sub-Saharan Africa. Today there are twice as many Christians as Muslims. Christ was a black man, while Muhammad had [white thighs](http://www.wikiislam.com/wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Muhammad's_White_Complexion).

[Listening to (and Saving) the World’s Languages](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/nyregion/29lost.html?pagewanted=print). I don’t get why there are always “languages of the world are dying” articles popping up regularly in the mainstream and scientific media. I mean there’s a great benefit to having one language unify diverse groups. It’s just like how Europeans gained efficiencies by ditching their local currencies and going with the Euro. Eh, well, perhaps not the best example right now….

[What can you learn from a whole genome sequence?](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/04/what_can_you_learn_from_a_whol.php) Dr. Daniel MacArthur seems to suggest that there isn’t a whole lot more you can learn that you couldn’t learn from a chip with hundreds of thousands of SNPs instead of all 3 billion base pairs. Seems about right. And remember the baseline, many people are highly skeptical of the marginal value of the SNP chips beyond what you’d know from your family history.

[Absence of Evidence for MHC–Dependent Mate Selection within HapMap Populations](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000925?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosgenetics/NewArticles+(PLoS+Genetics:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Reader). I’m starting to lean away from thinking that the MHC studies in humans are finding any real robust correlations. The studies are literally all over the place, with reverse signs of statistically significant correlations in some cases.
