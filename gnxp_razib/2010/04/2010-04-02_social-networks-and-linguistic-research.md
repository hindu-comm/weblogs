Social Networks and Linguistic Research

I’m always interested in ways of using social networking sites as massive pools of data for researchers to mine. So on that note check out [The Adventures of Auck](https://theadventuresofauck.blogspot.com)‘s post on [Cultural Variation and Social Networks](https://theadventuresofauck.blogspot.com/2010/04/cultural-variation-and-social-networks.html). The post is more of a rumination, accompanied by some simple statistical analyses, than a detailed exposition. But it is does highlight the potential of using social networking sites (he uses Twitter) to investigate a specific question, which in this case is: Do bilingual communities have different social network structures to monolingual communities? He’s got some pretty intriguing results, and like him I’m not sure what to make of them, but I certainly hope this is something he’ll develop in the future.

On another note, the blog also examines the surprising relationship between [language evolution and Acacia trees](https://theadventuresofauck.blogspot.com/2010/01/language-evolution-tree.html).
