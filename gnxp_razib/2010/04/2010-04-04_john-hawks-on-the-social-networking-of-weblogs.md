John Hawks on the social networking of weblogs

He asks: [Has Technorati suddenly gotten useful again?](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/blogging/technorati-working-again-2010.html) I’m tempted to take a look at Technorati again, though since I switched domains I’ll probably wait up until the shift from ScienceBlogs percolates through the web. One thing to note, John probably relies a bit more on reciprocal linking as the lubricant for discussion because he has no comments on this weblog.
