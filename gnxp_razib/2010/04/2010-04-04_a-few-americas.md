A few Americas

[The Best Jobs Report In a Long Time](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/04/best-jobs-report-in-long-time.html):

> Less than a high school diploma: 14.5%  
> High school with no college: 10.8%  
> Some college or associates degree: 8.2%  
> **Bachelor’s or higher: 4.9% (this is near full employment from an > economic perspective).**

If you read the media sometimes it seems like the past recession was total hell in the white-collar sector, but really it wasn’t (comparatively). For what it’s worth, 84% of readers of my weblogs have university degrees or higher….

(Yes, I know the issues in regards to underemployment, part-time employment and those who have dropped out of the labor force, but all the issues seem more relevant to those with less education from what I’ve seen. Correction with data welcome)
