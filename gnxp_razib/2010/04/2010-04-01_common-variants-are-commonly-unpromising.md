Common variants are commonly unpromising

Excellent post from Dr. Daniel MacArthur, [Common copy number variation doesn’t explain much complex disease risk – but why not?](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/04/common_copy_number_variation_d.php):

> The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium has just published the > results of a massive survey of common, large DNA duplications and > deletions (collectively termed copy number variation, or CNVs) in > 16,000 patients suffering from complex diseases and 3,000 controls. > The results come as no surprise, but are nonetheless disappointing: > the study identified absolutely no novel CNVs associated with complex > disease.

[Missing heritability](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/12/finding-missing-heritability.php) is a major issue. Though I guess it does science some good to have white whales to chase….
