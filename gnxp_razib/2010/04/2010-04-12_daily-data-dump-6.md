Daily Data Dump

[You’re Awesome, America!](http://www.slate.com/id/2250374/). The subhead is: “Why the U.S. recovery will be bigger, faster, and stronger than economists and politicians expect.”

[So How’s the Economy Doing, Anyway?](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/04/so-hows-economy-doing-anyway) Guarded pessimism from Kevin Drum. I do wonder about the fuel constraint as well.

[Synesthesia: crossed wires or free association?](https://wiringthebrain.blogspot.com/2010/03/synesthesia-crossed-wires-or-free.html) [Wiring the Brain](http://feeds.feedburner.com/blogspot/WiringTheBrain) is an RSS worthy blog.

[Literary critics scan the brain to find out why we love to read](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/11/brain-scans-probe-books-imagination). It seems that literary types are getting on the neuroimaging bandwagon, but am I wrong to believe that the high water mark of the early neuroimaging hype is now a thing of the past? This is not to say that neuroimaging is not important, just that it didn’t change *everything*, and a lot of bad science slipped in under its sexy cloak.

[Testing Influence of Tea Party in Kentucky](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/us/politics/11kentucky.html?hpw). Rand Paul vs. the Machine.
