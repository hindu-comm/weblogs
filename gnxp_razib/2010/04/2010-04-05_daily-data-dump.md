Daily Data Dump

I’m going to posting links M-F which I don’t manage to blog (probably focus less on science in these links as well). I’m calling it the “Daily Data Dump.”

[The Cloudy Revolution](http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/goodnight-gutenberg/2010/04/05/cloudy-revolution). 10 years after the initial hype the “cloud” is here. Somewhere Larry Ellison is crying.

[You Don’t Need an iPad](http://www.slate.com/id/2249822/pagenum/all/#p2), but Farhad Manjoo really, really, loves it. It sounds like the reviews of the Kindle on steroids. I don’t have a TV because the device is all about consumption, and I think I’ll avoid the iPad for the same reason. But just as television and the net are merging through online streaming, I assume that the iPad is a foretaste of what’s to come in computing devices. At least outside of the office (I think a little artificial constraint and discomfort probably is necessary in a work environment).

[You’re Born a Copy but Die an Original](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100404203159.htm). The values of elderly individuals diverge in relation to their age cohort between 70 and 90.

[Cassini Doubleheader: Flying By Titan and Dione](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100404221303.htm). Spaceflight is so banal today that it isn’t necessarily newsworthy. Who remembers Dione?

[Michael Steele calls his critics racist](http://dailycaller.com/2010/04/05/michael-steele-calls-his-critics-racist/). That’s really weak dawg.
