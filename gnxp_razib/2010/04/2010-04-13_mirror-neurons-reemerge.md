Mirror neurons reemerge

A few years ago I was hearing a lot about [mirror neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron). There was a hyped up article on *The Edge* website about them, [MIRROR NEURONS and imitation learning as the driving force behind “the great leap forward” in human evolution](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/ramachandran/ramachandran_p1.html). But I haven’t heard much since then, though I’m not neuro nerd so perhaps I’m out of the loop. So I pass on this link with interest, [Single-Neuron Responses in Humans during Execution and Observation of Actions](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4YT72MH-1&_user=10&_coverDate=04/08/2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f02d1f9f0529a5e32c4aaabf6d803822):

> Direct recordings in monkeys have demonstrated that neurons in frontal > and parietal areas discharge during execution and perception of > actions…Because these discharges “reflect” the perceptual aspects of > actions of others onto the motor repertoire of the perceiver, these > cells have been called mirror neurons. Their overlapping sensory-motor > representations have been implicated in observational learning and > imitation, two important forms of learning \[9\]. In humans, indirect > measures of neural activity support the existence of sensory-motor > mirroring mechanisms in homolog frontal and parietal areas…other motor > regions…and also the existence of multisensory mirroring mechanisms in > nonmotor region…We recorded extracellular activity from 1177 cells in > human medial frontal and temporal cortices while patients executed or > observed hand grasping actions and facial emotional expressions. A > significant proportion of neurons in supplementary motor area, and > hippocampus and environs, responded to both observation and execution > of these actions. A subset of these neurons demonstrated excitation > during action-execution and inhibition during action-observation. > **These findings suggest that multiple systems in humans may be > endowed with neural mechanisms of mirroring for both the integration > and differentiation of perceptual and motor aspects of actions > performed by self and others.**

*ScienceDaily* has a hyped-up headline, [First Direct Recording Made of Mirror Neurons in Human Brain](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100412162112.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)&utm_content=Google+Reader).

**Update:** [Neuro~~skeptic~~critic has much more](https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/04/mirror-neurons-join-marilyn-monroe.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNeurocritic+(The+Neurocritic)&utm_content=Google+Reader).
