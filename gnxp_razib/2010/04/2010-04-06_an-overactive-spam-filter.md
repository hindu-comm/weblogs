An overactive spam filter

It has been brought to my attention that some legitimate comments without copious linkage seem to have gotten caught in the spam filter. If your comment is legit and it isn’t showing up after a day (or, if you’ve already been approved for comments and it doesn’t show up immediately), [email me](http://razib.com/).
