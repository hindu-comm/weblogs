District 13

I wasn’t feeling well today (flu), so I decided to see what was in Netflix. I ended up watching Luc Besson’s [District 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_13). It’s an action film without the typical special effects, rather, it hinges on the main actors’ mastery of [parkour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour). Here’s a YouTube clip of a sequence which illustrates the parkour techniques:

Much more like an Asian martial arts flick than a Western action movie. Highly recommended for these sorts of sequences. Here’s an [article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_wilkinson?currentPage=all) in *The New Yorker* about parkour.
