Review of the Hobbit paper

[Excellent one](http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/is-homo-floresiensis-really-that-strange/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingAnthropologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Anthropology)&utm_content=Google+Reader) at [A Primate of Modern Aspect](http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/is-homo-floresiensis-really-that-strange/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingAnthropologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Anthropology)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

The mouse lemur decreased in both to a greater > degree, for example.
