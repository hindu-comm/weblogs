Peer groups & bourgeois virtues

[Self-Control and Peer Groups](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/01/self-control_and_peer_groups.php):

> However, according to a new study by Michelle vanDellen, a > psychologist at the University of Georgia, self-control contains a > large social component; the ability to resist temptation is > contagious. The paper consists of five clever studies, each of which > demonstrates the influence of our peer group on our self-control > decisions. For instance, in one study 71 undergraduates watched a > stranger exert self-control by choosing a carrot instead of a cookie, > while others watched people eat the cookie instead of the carrot. > Thatâ€™s all that happened: the volunteers had no other interaction with > the eaters. Nevertheless, the performance of the subjects was > significantly altered on a subsequent test of self-control. People who > watched the carrot-eaters had more discipline than those who watched > the cookie-eaters.

I assume [time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) is heritable (at least via its correlation with other traits such as IQ), but, that assumes you control background social and cultural variables.
