Lactase persistance in India

[Frequency of lactose malabsorption among healthy southern and northern Indian populations by genetic analysis and lactose hydrogen breath and tolerance tests](http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/1/140):

> Volunteers from southern and northern India were comparable in age and > sex. The LTT result was abnormal in 88.2% of southern Indians and in > 66.2% of northern Indians…The lactose HBT result was abnormal in 78.9% > of southern Indians and in 57.1% of northern Indians…The CC genotype > was present in 86.8% and 67.5%…the CT genotype was present in 13.2% > and 26.0%…and the TT genotype was present in 0% and 6.5%..of southern > and northern Indians, respectively. The frequency of symptoms after > the lactose load…and peak concentrations of breath hydrogen…both of > which might indicate the degree of lactase deficiency, were higher in > southern than in northern Indians.

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/lptact3-763608.png)The north Indian samples were from [Lucknow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow) on the mid-Gangetic plain, and the south Indian samples from [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). The genetic variant conferring lactase persistence is the [Central Asian](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/08/convergent-evolution-of-lactase.php) one, T-1390. You can see the distribution of the genotypes by phenotype in the table to the left. These authors assume that the T allele was brought by the Indo-Aryans; this seems plausible seeing its clinal variation, as well the fact that this variant seems to be common in European and Central Asian populations. The frequency of the T allele in the Lucknow sample was 39%, and 13% in the Bangalore sample. Here are a selection of frequencies for the T allele in other populations:

17% – Saami  
13% – Greeks (Athens)  
82% – Scandinavians (Stockholm)  
6% – Tuscans (Florence)  
24% – Russians (Moscow)  
73% – English (London)  
66% – Basques  
10% – Roma (Prague)  
56% – Germans (Hamburg)  
95% – North Irish (Enniskillen)  
1% – Armenian (Yerevan)  
5% – Uygur (Beijing)  
10% – Mongolian (Beijing)  
13% – Indians (Madras)  
19% – Indians (New Dehli)  
36% – Balochi (Islamabad)  
51% – Pathan
