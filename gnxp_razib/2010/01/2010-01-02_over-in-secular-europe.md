Over in secular Europe

[Irish atheists challenge new blasphemy laws](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/01/irish-atheists-challenge-blasphemy-law):

> Secular campaigners in the Irish Republic defied a strict new > blasphemy law which came into force today by publishing a series of > anti-religious quotations online and promising to fight the > legislation in court.  
> The new law, which was passed in July, means that blasphemy in Ireland > is now a crime punishable with a fine of up to €25,000 (£22,000).  
> It defines blasphemy as “publishing or uttering matter that is grossly > abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion, > thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of > adherents of that religion, with some defences permitted”.  
> The justice minister, Dermot Ahern, **said that the law was necessary > because while immigration had brought a growing diversity of religious > faiths**, the 1936 constitution extended the protection of belief only > to Christians.

> The police foiled an attempt to kill an artist who drew a cartoon > depicting the Prophet Muhammad that sparked outrage in the Muslim > world, the head of Denmark’s intelligence service said Saturday.  
> Jakob Scharf, who heads PET, the Danish intelligence service, said a > 28-year-old Somalia man was armed with an ax and a knife when he tried > to enter the home of the artist, Kurt Westergaard, in Aarhus on Friday > evening.

Westergaard was home with his 5 year old granddaughter. It looks like the [Danish People’s Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_People's_Party) might be subsidizing unhinged adherents of the Religion of Peace, because they’re going to the primary beneficiaries of attempts to spread the barbaric mores of [much of the Muslim world](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/12/cultures-of-restriction-islam-india-and.php) in regards to anti-religious expression to the civilized world.
