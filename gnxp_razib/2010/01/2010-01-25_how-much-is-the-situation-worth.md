How much is "The Situation" worth?

[‘Jersey Shore’ — MTV Tries to Divide and Conquer](http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/25/jersey-shore-mtv-the-situation-pauly-d-the-situation-negotiating-contract/):

> Sources tell TMZ the network has told the cast if they don’t accept > MTV’s deal by the end of business Monday, they will be replaced. And, > MTV has told them it does not have to be a package deal — the cast > members who accept the offer will stay … those who do not can have a > nice life. >
> As we first reported, MTV offered each cast member a \$10,000 signing > bonus and \$5,000 per episode. We’re told the cast rejected the offer > and made it clear they would all stand together and hold out for their > price, though they didn’t say what it was. >
> MTV made a new offer of \$10,000 an episode — there are 12 episodes in > the new season — but so far the cast hasn’t responded. >
> We’re told MTV already has replacements if Snooki, Pauly D, The > Situation and the others don’t accept the offer on Monday. But, we’re > told, MTV is happy to mix and match if some of the cast accepts the > offer and others don’t. >
> As for who’s being the most hard-headed in the negotiations — The > Situation and Pauly D.
