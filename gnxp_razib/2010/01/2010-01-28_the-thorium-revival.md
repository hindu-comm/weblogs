The thorium revival

[Mike the Mad Biologist](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2010/01/is_thorium_an_answer_to_global.php) points me to an interesting article in *Wired*, [Uranium Is So Last Century — Enter Thorium, the New Green Nuke](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_new_nukes/all/1). Of course *Wired* is a booster of many things which never take off, but in general I think it’s probably safe to bet on nuclear power becoming more prominent in the near-to-medium-future. I recently have been reading a bit about oil, stuff that’s not written by [Daniel Yergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prize:_The_Epic_Quest_for_Oil,_Money,_and_Power), and was fascinated by this chart of long term crude prices:  
![Inflation_Adj_Oil_Prices_Ch.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Inflation_Adj_Oil_Prices_Ch.png?resize=500%2C367)![Inflation_Adj_Oil_Prices_Ch.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Inflation_Adj_Oil_Prices_Ch.png?resize=500%2C367)  
The inflation adjusted values are of interest. **But look at the lack of volatility before 1974!** My whole life has been characterized by volatility of crude oil prices, so I simply assumed that that was the nature of the beast….
