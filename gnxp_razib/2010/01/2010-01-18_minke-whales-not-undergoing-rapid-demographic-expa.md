Minke whales not undergoing rapid demographic expansion

[Are Antarctic minke whales unusually abundant because of 20th century whaling?](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123216925/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

Populations, such as humans, who have expanded rapidly from a small population tend to exhibit a particular [genetic signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajima's_D).
