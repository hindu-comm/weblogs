Mongol

[![mongol.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/mongol.png?resize=200%2C300)![mongol.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/mongol.png?resize=200%2C300)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416044/)I noticed that [Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416044/) was watchable online on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/WiHome) the other day, so I checked it out. I liked it. As any movie there were liberties taken with aspects of Genghis Khan’s biography, but I felt like most of them were true to the general outlines of what really happened. The main downside was the whole warlord-with-a-heart-of-gold element to his personality. I’m definitely looking forward to [The Great Khan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235784/), the rumored sequel.
