The New York Times may charge for content

That’s what [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/01/new_york_times_set_to_mimic_ws.html) is reporting. By spring. I’ve actually paid for online content before, but generally have let my subscriptions lapse because the net has so much information that it didn’t seem worth it. It seems likely that [Google News](https://news.google.com/) and other aggregators will be the big winner out of this. In many areas *The New York Times* does have better content (e.g., [Carl Zimmer’s](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/) articles), but the big difference from other newspapers is the breadth of their coverage. It’s one-stop-shopping, and most aggregators don’t offer much of an advantage. With a price differential they may.  
All that being said, this seems like a more rational and realistic plan than gating off opinion columnists as they did with [TimesSelect](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-new-york-times-to-close-timesselect-effective-wednesday/). Opinion seems to be where a traditional newspaper operation has been totally superseded by web-only outfits, in large part because columnists who do print & web duty are more constrained in terms of space and frequency. On the other hand, *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal* do publish articles in specialized areas such as science, foreign affairs and business which strike a perfect balance between the vanilla generalities you could find in the AP and the narrow focus websites which assume some level of technical fluency.
