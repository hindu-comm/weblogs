Primitive man had "Neandertal teeth"

[Dental maturational sequence and dental tissue proportions in the early Upper Paleolithic child from Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/22/0914202107.short?rss=1):

Modern humans have been becoming more gracile over the past few tens of thousands of years. Why? Probably has something to do with the switch to agriculture. It goes to show the importance of local environment in shaping phenotype.
