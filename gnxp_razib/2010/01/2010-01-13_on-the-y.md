On the Y

Here’s the link to the new paper in *Naure* on the evolution of the human & chimp Y chromosome, [Chimpanzee and human Y chromosomes are remarkably divergent in structure and gene content](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature08700.html). [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100113131505.htm) and [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/science/14gene.html?ref=global-home&pagewanted=print) have summaries up. Wonder if there’ll be future editions of [Adam’s Curse](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001114.html)….
