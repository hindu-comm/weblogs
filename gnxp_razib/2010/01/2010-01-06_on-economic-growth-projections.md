On economic growth projections

[Alex Tabarrok](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/01/soviet-growth-american-textbooks.html) has the back story on the [infamous Paul Samuelson projections about Soviet growth](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/01/soviet-growth-american-textbooks.html). It gets interesting:

> Tarshis and Heilbroner were more liberal than Samuelson and McConnell > but offered a more nuanced, descriptive and tentative account of the > Soviet economy. Why? **Levy and Peart argue that they were saved from > error not by skepticism about the Soviet Union per se but rather by > skepticism about the power of simple economic theories to fully > describe the world in the absence of rich institutional detail.**

The issue can be generalized to many domains outside economics. If someone tells you that Polaris will be in the same position in the sky that it is today in [26,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star#Past_and_future), all things equal, trust them. If someone then goes on to preface a description of social model with “assuming current rates of….”, and then projects beyond a generation, be very cautious.
