Jersey Shore coming back

They’ve been [signed](http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/31/jersey-shore-cast-season-two-contracts-snooki-situation/) for \$10,000 per episode the next go around. Years ago [Joel](http://yrif.org/) floated the idea of using Reality TV to test theories in social science. Paying the cast of *Jersey Shore* this much is going to mean that they’ll be under serious pressure to produce high quality “product.” I assume that means they’re crank up the magnitude of their “character.” For example, Ronnie Magro will be under pressure to beat up more d-bags next season. “The Situation” is going to have to do the nasty with even nastier.
