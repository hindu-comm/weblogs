Levelling off of the "Obesity Epidemic"?

Thereâ€™s a lot of media buzz right now about a new report in JAMA on the empirical trends on prevalence of obesity in the United States. You can [read the whole paper here](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/2009.2014v1) (too many tables, not enough graphs). Interestingly, like George W. Bush it seems that [Harry Reid](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/magazine/24reid-t.html?ref=politics&pagewanted=print) is prejudiced against the overweight. The data in the paper above strongly implies that anti-fat bigotry is going to have disparate impact.
