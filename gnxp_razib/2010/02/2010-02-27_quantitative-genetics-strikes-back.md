Quantitative genetics strikes back! (?)

[The Genetics of Human Adaptation: Hard Sweeps, Soft Sweeps, and Polygenic Adaptation](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02070-3):

The whole review is well written & open access, so I would recommend just reading the whole thing. I would though add that obviously population and quantitative genetics complement each other because they approach the same phenomenon from opposite ends. Additionally, one of the major criticisms of Charles Darwin’s original work was its heavy reliance on domesticated lineages which had been subject to artificial selection on quantitative traits. I suspect in many ways humans are themselves “self-domesticated,” and the protean nature of the selection regimes shaped by rapidly changing culture makes it more likely than not that we adapt through tweaking standing genetic variation.
