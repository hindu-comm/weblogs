Be safe and live long

[Arboreality has allowed for the evolution of increased longevity in mammals](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/02/12/0911439107.abstract):

> The evolutionary theory of aging predicts that species will experience > delayed senescence and increased longevity when rates of extrinsic > mortality are reduced. It has long been recognized that birds and bats > are characterized by lower rates of extrinsic mortality and greater > longevities than nonvolant endotherms, presumably because flight > reduces exposure to terrestrial predators, disease, and environmental > hazards. Like flight, arboreality may act to reduce extrinsic > mortality, delay senescence, and increase longevity and has been > suggested as an explanation for the long lifespans of primates. > However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested in mammals in general. > We analyze a large dataset of mammalian longevity records to test > whether arboreal mammals are characterized by greater longevities than > terrestrial mammals. Here, we show that arboreal mammals are longer > lived than terrestrial mammals at common body sizes, independent of > phylogeny. Subclade analyses demonstrate that this trend holds true in > nearly every mammalian subgroup, with two notable > exceptionsâ€“metatherians (marsupials) and euarchontans (primates and > their close relatives). These subgroups are unique in that each has > experienced a long and persistent arboreal evolutionary history, with > subsequent transitions to terrestriality occurring multiple times > within each group. In all other clades examined, terrestriality > appears to be the primitive condition, **and species that become > arboreal tend to experience increased longevity, often independently > in multiple lineages within each clade.** Adoption of an arboreal > lifestyle may have allowed for increased longevity in these lineages > and in primates in general. Overall, these results confirm the > fundamental predictions of the evolutionary theory of aging.

The same logic probably explains the [long lifespans of tortises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise#Lifespan). Until humans showed up their shells were pretty good at insulating them from the risks of predation.
