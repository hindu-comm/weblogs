Armenian genetics

[Armenian genes: Scientist in Yerevan launches a project to reveal genetic history of the nation](http://armenianow.com/news/21032/armenian_genetic_history). The description of the science in the piece is ***very*** garbled. But, it would be nice to elucidate the genetics of Armenians in more detail. Their language, like Greek and Albanian, is a singleton in the [Indo-European family tree](http://www.wsu.edu/~gordonl/S05/354/IE-Germanic_files/image002.jpg). Additionally, the Armenian nation has an extremely [long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia#History). Their identity crystallized in the wake of the Persian and Hellenistic Empires just like that of the Jews.

Demographically we know that historically much of eastern Anatolia was dominated by Armenians. Many of the [prominent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_dynasty) Byzantine dynasties were of Hellenized Armenian lineages. I would predict that one will likely find that most of the Turks of eastern Anatolia would cluster with Armenians, just as those Turks from the west and coastal Anatolia might cluster more with Greeks, because it seems likely that the ethnogenesis of most Turks in Anatolia was a process whereby Greeks and Armenians assimilated to the identity of a small minority of eastern Turkish invaders.
