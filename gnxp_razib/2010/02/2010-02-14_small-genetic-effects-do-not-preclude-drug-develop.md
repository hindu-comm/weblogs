Small genetic effects do not preclude drug development

[Daniel MacArthur points](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/the_end_for_the_decodeme_perso.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2Fgeneticfuture+%28Genetic+Future%29) me to [a Newsweek article](http://www.newsweek.com/id/233494) on the bankruptcy of Decode Genetics. The author describes (one of) Decode’s problems like this:

> The genetics of illness turned out to be more complex than researchers > expected. At deCODE and elsewhere, the new genes linked to common > diseases turned out to be rare or to have only small effects on > individual risk. That killed any prospect of using deCODE’s > discoveries to make blockbuster drugs.

The leap–that small genetic effect sizes means no prospects of drug discovery–sounds reasonable, but is actually wrong. Here’s an example of why:

Consider a trait like, say, cholesterol levels. [Massive genome-wide association studies have been performed on this trait](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v41/n1/full/ng.269.html), identifying a large number of loci of small effect. One of these loci is HMGCR, coding for [HMG-CoA reductase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG-CoA_reductase), an important molecule in cholesterol synthesis. The allele identified increases cholesterol levels by 0.1 standard deviations, meaning a genetic test would have essentially no ability to predict cholesterol levels. By the logic of the Newsweek piece, any drug targeted at HMGCR would have no chance of becoming a blockbuster.

Any doctor knows where I’m going with this: one of the best-selling groups of drugs in the world currently are [statins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin), which inhibit the activity of (the gene product of) HMGCR. Of course, statins have already been invented, so this is something of a cherry-picked example, but my guess is that there are tens of additional examples like this waiting to be discovered in the wealth of genome-wide association study data. Figuring out which GWAS hits are promising drug targets will take time, effort, and a good deal of luck; in my opinion, this is the major lesson from Decode (which is not all that surprising a lesson)–drug development is really hard.
