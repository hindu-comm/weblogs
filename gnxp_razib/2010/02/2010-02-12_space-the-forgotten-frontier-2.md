Space, the forgotten frontier

[The End of the Space Age](http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/the-age-of-space/):

The administration > wouldn’t be cutting the manned spaceflight program if Americans were > still enthusiastic about going to the stars — if space exploration > still occupied a privileged place in our imagination, if our jocks > still wanted to be astronauts and our nerds still wanted to build > rockets. Obama is simply bowing to our culture’s priorities: Our geeks > want to build a better XBox, and our jocks want to buy it to play Call > of Duty: Modern Warfare.

Bush made a declaration that some day we’d [make it to Mars](http://www.space.com/news/bush_1989speech_040114.html). That day keeps disappearing over the horizon.
