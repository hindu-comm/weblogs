Canada vs. USA Hockey

![sp_0710_05_v6.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/sp_0710_05_v6.jpg?resize=250%2C187)![sp_0710_05_v6.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/sp_0710_05_v6.jpg?resize=250%2C187)There’s apparently a game in this sport at the Olympics tonight. Canada is the favorite. Which is awesome, because if the USA loses, no one in the USA will care. But if the USA wins, we’ll get to laugh at the Canadians. Don’t lie, you know Canada is the country that keeps on giving in terms of humor.  
**Update:** Yeah, you guys are funny. LOL.
