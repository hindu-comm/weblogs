Brain damage = transcendence

[The Spiritual Brain: Selective Cortical Lesions Modulate Human Self-Transcendence](http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(10)00052-8):

This seems part of the general phenomenon that neurological findings confirm what you know from more conventional personal experience. Drugs, deprivation (e.g., fasting) and traumatic personal events seem to push people toward this state of “self-transcendence” quite often. If [Hóng Xiùquán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan#Visions_and_iconoclasm) had managed to pass his civil service examination, perhaps the decline of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century would have been a bit less [traumatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion#Death_toll).  
I assume that susceptibility to self-transcendence has something of a genetic component through the heritability of personality. There have been atheists with a materialist world-view who I have met who seem emotionally fragile to me, and I generally assume that they’ll become religious later in life because of some spiritual experience. Quite often I later find out that they’ve had exactly such a first person experience, and are religiously devout. In contrast, others (a smaller number in my estimation) lose faith and become much more concrete and irreligious in their orientation in the face of trauma or distress. A combination of circumstance & predisposition then leads to very different behavioral phenotypes, which I assume are ultimately conditioned on differences in initial hardwiring.
