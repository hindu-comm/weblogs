Graphs lack mass appeal?

Andrew Gelman, [Red State, Blue State sales are a factor of 2^100 lower than they should’ve been](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/02/red_state_blue_8.html):

> In his forthcoming book, Albert-László Barabási writes, “There is a > theorem in publishing that each graph halves a book’s audience.” If > only someone had told me this two years ago! >
> More seriously, this tongue-in-cheek theorem, if true, defines an > upsetting paradox. As we discussed at the beginning of the Notes > section of Red State, Blue State, we structured the book around graphs > because that seemed to be the best way to communicate our findings. > Tables are not a serious way of conveying numerical information on the > scale that we’re interested in, and, sure, we could’ve done it all in > words (even saying things like “We ran a regression and it was > statistically significant”), but we felt that this would not fully > involve readers in our reasoning. The paradox–or maybe it’s not such a > paradox at all–is that graphs are grabby, they engage the reader, but > this makes reading the book a slower, more intense, and more difficult > endeavor.

I recall hearing about the lack of appeal of *equations*, and their negative impact on book sales, but not graphs. Then again, I remember that the author of [Calculated Exuberance](https://calculatedexuberance.blogspot.com/) was a bit perplexed when I enthused about his chart & graph heavy posts.

Here’s a chart from from a paper in *Current Biology*, [The Evolution of Human Genetic and Phenotypic Variation in Africa](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02065-X):

All that information in prose would take up more time, and be way less precise.
