Goodbye Peace Dividend

I got the following chart from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States), and it suggests that on a per capita inflation-adjusted basis weâ€™re spending **more on defense today than we were during the Reagan build-up, or Vietnam!** Is this for real?
