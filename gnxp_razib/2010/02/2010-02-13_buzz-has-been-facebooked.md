Buzz has been "Facebooked"

[Critics Say Google Invades Privacy With New Service](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/technology/internet/13google.html):

The reference to Facebook is that when Facebook does something a bit shady in regards to privacy there is often an explosion of indignation which results in Facebook having to walk-back features (e.g., the default visibility of friend lists). That being said, Facebook is huge, and still expanding. So I don’t see this as necessarily anything more than a speed-bump for Google Buzz. But personally I’m really not so sure that I want one company to manage my “social graph,” provide productivity tools (Google Docs), and so on. I don’t need a “too big to fail” software service at this point in my life.
