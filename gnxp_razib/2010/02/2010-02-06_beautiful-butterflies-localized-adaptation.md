Beautiful butterflies & localized adaptation

Two new papers are out in *PLoS Genetics* which make inferences about adaptation using butterfly species which exhibit [Mullerian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry). I’ll give the author summaries instead of the abstracts.

[Genomic Hotspots for Adaptation: The Population Genetics of Mullerian Mimicry in the Heliconius melpomene Clade](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000794?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosgenetics/NewArticles+(PLoS+Genetics:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

> The diversity of wing patterns in Heliconius butterflies is a > longstanding example of both Mullerian mimicry and adaptive radiation. > The genetic regions controlling such patterns are “hotspots” for > adaptive evolution, with small regions of the genome controlling major > changes in wing pattern. Across multiple hybrid zones in Heliconius > melpomene and related species, we no find no strong population signal > of recent selection. Nonetheless, we find significant associations > between genetic variation and wing pattern at multiple sites. **This > suggests patterning alleles are relatively old, and *might be a better > model for most natural adaptation*, in contrast to the simple genetic > basis of recent human-induced selection such as pesticide > resistance.** Strikingly, across the region controlling the red > forewing band, a very strong association with phenotype implicates > three genes as potentially being involved in control of wing pattern. > One of these, a kinesin gene, shows parallel differences in expression > levels between divergent forms in the two mimetic species, making it a > strong candidate for control of wing pattern. These results show that > mimicry involves parallel changes in gene expression and strongly > suggest a role for this gene in control of wing pattern.

[Genomic Hotspots for Adaptation: The Population Genetics of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius erato](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000796):

Here’s a section from the first paper which I found intriguing:

> **The results therefore appear to support the ‘shifting balance’ model > for the evolution of Heliconius colour pattern races**…whereby novel > wing patterns arise and spread through otherwise continuous > populations behind moving hybrid zones…The ‘Pleistocene refuge’ model > seems less likely, as recent contact after extended periods of > geographic isolation would presumably have left a stronger signal of > genetic differentiation between divergent races, perhaps across the > genome but especially more strongly in regions linked to patterning > loci…

I have no idea why they necessarily think this validates the shifting balance. You can see David’s [critique](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000629.html) of the model, but reading [Will Provine’s intellectual biography of Sewall Wright](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684733/geneexpressio-20/) it seems that the shifting balance sometimes becomes the evolutionary genetic version of “it’s complicated.”\* What they seem to have done here though is refute a simple model of powerful selective sweeps giving rise to these morphs recently. Rather, these seem to be ancient local adaptations, whose frequencies and genetic architectures are perhaps perturbed by long term exogenous (e.g., environment) and endogenous (e.g., complex frequency dependencies) dynamics.

Despite my lack of clarity on a few theoretical issues, I found the papers very interesting, and haven’t really processed them fully.

\* I see one reference to [epistasis](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/through-rugged-roads-of-gene-land.php) in both papers, and that concept is very important in the shifting balance. Though I assume the [LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium) and supergenes might point to that.
