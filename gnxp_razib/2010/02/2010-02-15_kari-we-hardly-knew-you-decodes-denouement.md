Kári we hardly knew you, deCODE's dénouement

[Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/the_end_for_the_decodeme_perso.php) returns from hiatus, and observes that [deCODE](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/the_end_for_the_decodeme_perso.php) is now in the advanced stages of corporate death. Pointers to a *Newsweek* article and other bloggers at Dr. MacArthur’s post. Over at [Gene Expression Classic](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/small-genetic-effects-do-not-preclude.php) [p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/small-genetic-effects-do-not-preclude.php) points out that [Small genetic effects do not preclude drug development](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/small-genetic-effects-do-not-preclude.php) (one of the rationales given for why deCODE couldn’t translate associations in \$\$\$).  
Also, for historical perspective, check out this [2002 article about deCODE](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/health/genetics/18PROF.html?pagewanted=1&pagewanted=print).
