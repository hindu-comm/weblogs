Sometimes it just tastes good Felix

I agree that the “story” or our understanding of something (e.g., whether it’s \$100 or \$10) can affect our perception of the hedonic experience. But sometimes **coffee just tastes better.** So the first time I had a [Stumptown roast](http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/) I was blown away, without knowing anything of the roaster’s history or reputation (it has a good reputation). I wasn’t even much of a coffee snob then (and really, I’m not much now). Though I think that [the narrative of civet coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak) might make me avoid it, even I if accept that objectively it has a better taste.

**Note:** Naturally Felix takes wine as an analog. But I think the ‘narrative’ is a much bigger deal in that case because people have far less objective discernment when it comes to wine.
