Don't genetically profile yourself just yet…perhaps

*Newsweek* has a [long piece](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/07/the-little-flaw-in-the-longevity-gene-study-that-could-be-a-big-problem.html) up which reviews some major issues with the new study of centenarians that’s been all over the media right now. [Ed Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/07/01/genetic-signatures-for-extreme-old-age-accurately-predict-odds-of-living-past-100/) already covered the paper, but I’m going to look at the details myself. Here’s a update from the *Newsweek* post:

> Within an hour of this story’s publication, the Science study’s > authors released a statement which a BU spokeswoman described as > appearing “because of your inquiry and a similar one from the New York > Times concerning methodology used to test 2 of the 150 genetic > variants.” Here is what the statement says: “Since the publication of > our study in Science, which was extensively peer-reviewed, a question > has been raised about two elements of the findings. One has to do with > two of the 150 genetic variants included in the prediction model, > while the other is related to the criteria used to determine the > significance of the individual variants. On the first concern, we have > been made aware that there is a technical error in the lab test used > on approximately 10% of the centenarian sample that involved the two > of the 150 variants. Our preliminary analysis of this issue suggests > that the apparent error would not effect the overall accuracy of the > model. Because the issue has been raised since the publication of the > paper, we are now closely re-examining the analysis. Another question > that was raised concerns the criteria used to determine if an > association between a genetic variant and exceptional longevity was > statistically significant. We used standard criteria for the analysis, > and we are confident that the appropriate threshold was used.”
