How Lost Should Have Ended

So I’ve never watched an episode of *Lost*. And I probably never will as people keep saying that the finale made following all those seasons kind of pointless. But could someone interpret the following video? I don’t get what’s so amusing about it…because I haven’t watched the primary material, which is obviously pretty complex.
