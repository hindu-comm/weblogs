Daily Data Dump – Wednesday

Another reminder, if you are a **regular reader**, and have not done so, please take the [Summer 2010 Gene Expression survey](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/default.asp?SurveyID=72013).

[Assortative mating, regression and all that: offspring IQ vs parental midpoint](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2010/07/assortative-mating-regression-and-all.html). Very sad: “For n = 3 (parental midpoint of 145) the mean for the kids would be 127 and the probability of exceeding 145 less than 10 percent.”

[On individuality, stochasticity and buffering](http://astuscience.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/on-individuality-stochasticity-and-buffering/). I think this is relevant at higher levels of organization than cell biology as well.

[How far will the homeownership rate fall?](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/07/how-far-will-homeownership-rate-fall.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+CalculatedRisk+(Calculated+Risk)) This is not necessarily a disaster. People are less rooted, but that means there is more fluidity in labor mobility.

[Get a Blazing-Fast Computer for Free](http://www.slate.com/id/2261781/). I’ve been using Ubuntu (dual boot) for years. I think perhaps it is ready for “prime time” in relation to ease-of-use for your grandmother. At least if she likes to perform BIOS upgrades!

[Social Relationships and Mortality Risk: A Meta-analytic Review](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316). We’re a social animal. I think that the methodological individualism at the heart of American politics, liberal, libertarian, and conservative, may not be rooted in human nature. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. But good to know.
