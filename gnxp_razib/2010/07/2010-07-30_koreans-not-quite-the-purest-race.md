Koreans, not quite the purest race?

I can’t comment too much on the inferences they make from the results because I’m not familiar with the geography of South Korea, or particular historical details. But more generally the genetics of Korea are of particular interest for [social reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea#Demographics):

Korean racialism has recently gotten the spotlight in works such as [The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1933633913/geneexpressio-20/), articles in *The New York Times* about[South Korean prejudice against dark-skinned people](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?scp=1&sq=korea%20racism&st=cse), and the rise of [mixed-origin Koreans nationals](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29babies.html?scp=1&sq=korea%20vietnam%20brides&st=cse) due to the large number of Vietnamese brides in rural areas. Here’s an interesting comment on South Korean race consciousness, [Western Mixed-Race Men Can Join Military](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/205_59014.html):

The article was published in January of 2010. And that’s not the [weirdest idea](http://anthropology.net/2007/06/05/evolution-of-humans-according-to-north-korea/) to come out of the Korean peninsula. With all that in mind, the distinctiveness, or lack thereof, of the Korean nation as adduced from scientific genetics is of particular curiosity, as it is a clear example of the intersection of science and culture. First, here’s the figure which shows where in Asia & South Korea they got their samples from:

![journal.pone.0011855.g001](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g001.png?resize=600%2C402)![journal.pone.0011855.g001](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g001.png?resize=600%2C402)

And here’s a detailed breakdown of samples:

![journal.pone.0011855.t001](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.t001.png?resize=600%2C479)![journal.pone.0011855.t001](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.t001.png?resize=600%2C479)

One point to note is that there seem to be some mixed-nationality individuals in the sample; Korean-Japanese, and Korean-Vietnamese. Here’s a [MDS plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) showing the relationship between the various East Asian groups:

[![journal.pone.0011855.g002](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g002.png?resize=600%2C660)![journal.pone.0011855.g002](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g002.png?resize=600%2C660)](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/11/population-substructure-within-china/)

And Structure (remember K = putative ancestral populations which contribute quanta to the genome of individuals):

![journal.pone.0011855.g003](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g003.png?resize=600%2C509)![journal.pone.0011855.g003](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g003.png?resize=600%2C509)

I think it is important to note that their Chinese samples were all **north Chinese; Beijing and Manchurian**. Fujianese and Cantonese would span the Vietnamese and Chinese cluster. The outliers are probably due to the moderately cosmopolitan nature of the Beijing HapMap sample. The Han Chinese are less diverse than Europeans as a whole, [but not inordinately so](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/11/population-substructure-within-china/) (using pairwise Fst’s a measure). There is an asymmetry when talking about China and any other East Asian nation because it is feasible that Han groups from various regions of China are more genetically similar to non-Han groups which are geographical neighbors. This is what L. L. Cavalli-Sforza found in [History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20). The northern Chinese clustered with northern Asians, while the southern Chinese clustered with Southeast Asian groups. There have been conflicting results since that initial finding, but I think that points to the sensitivity of some of the inferences to the geographical and linguistic biases of sampling (different dialect groups in [Guangdong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong) may be very genetically distinct).

With all that said it’s pretty clear from the above figure that the Japanese and Korean samples are close enough that you need to zoom in on them specifically. So here you go:

![journal.pone.0011855.g004](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g004.png?resize=600%2C642)![journal.pone.0011855.g004](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/journal.pone.0011855.g004.png?resize=600%2C642)

KB_Japanese = Kobe Japanese. In the paper itself they’re testing a few historical hypotheses. So I’ll leave it to them for the interpretation:

The connections between coastal southern Korea and the western islands of Japan are well known. It seems like that the [Yayoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_) people, who probably contributed the preponderance of the ancestry of modern Japanese, arrived in Kyushu approximate \~2,500 years ago. And were originally a group within the Korean peninsula. Over the past 2,000 years Korea has gone through a process of ethnic-linguistic homogenization during the ethnogenesis of the modern Korean nation, but it seems possible that the original group(s) which gave rise to the Yayoi existed in southern Korea to facilitate contact between the islands and the peninsula into the historical era.
