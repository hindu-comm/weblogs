"Unzipped," not the film about Isaac Mizrahi

Just got notice of a new weblog, [Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/), which I have added to my [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GenomesUnzipped) feed. One of the primary contributors is [Dr. Daniel MacArthur of *Genetic Future*](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/announcing_genomes_unzipped_a.php) (no, he’s not leaving ScienceBlogs!). Another is the [always impressive](http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=871) Luke Jostins. Here’s their *raison d’etre*:

> Welcome to Genomes Unzipped, a new group blog bringing together > experts in the scientific, legal, ethical and commercial aspects of > genetics. Our goal is to provide you with independent analysis of > advances in the field of genetics, with a particular focus on > implications for the budding industry of personal genomics. We’ll also > be discussing ways in which you can make the most of your own genetic > data using online resources and techniques developed by researchers.
