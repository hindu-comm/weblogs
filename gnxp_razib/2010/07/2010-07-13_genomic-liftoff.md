Genomic liftoff

The firm [GenomeQuest](http://www.genomequest.com/) has a blog, and on that blog they have a post, [Implications of exponential growth of global whole genome sequencing capacity](http://blog.genomequest.com/2010/07/implications-of-exponential-growth-of-global-whole-genome-sequencing-capacity/). In that post there are some bullet points with numbers. Here they are:

\* 2001-2009: A Human Genome

\* 2010: 1,000 Genomes – Learning the Ropes

\* 2011: 50,000 Genomes – Clinical Flirtation

\* 2012: 250,000 Genomes – Clinical Early Adoption

\* 2013: 1 Million Genomes – Consumer Awareness

\* 2014: 5 Million Genomes – Consumer Reality

\* 2015-2020: 25 Million Genomes And Beyond – A Brave New World

Let’s transform these projections into charts.

Of course GenomeQuest sells analytics tools for the tsunami of genomic data which they see cresting. Though if only 25,000,000 people have whole genome sequenced by the year 2020, I’m not sure if we’ll feel that it’s a “tsunami” of data at that point. I’m sure there would be plenty of stories about the “sequencing gap” between different communities, by class and race and what not. But what do you think about GenomeQuest’s projections?
