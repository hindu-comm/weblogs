Daily Data Dump – Wednesday

[Case-Control Analysis of SNPs in GLUT4, RBP4 and STRA6: Association of SNPs in STRA6 with Type 2 Diabetes in a South Indian Population](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011444?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosone/GeneticsandGenomics+(PLoS+ONE+Alerts:+Genetics+and+Genomics)). Nice to see this sort of stuff. If [Reich et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html) are correct that there are many population-specific disease patterns in South Asia then this level of granularity is necessary.

[Huffington Post Is Afraid of Criticism From Their Own Writers](http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2010/07/huffington_post_is_afraid_of_c.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). A little creative re-editing to soften the tip of the spear.

[Many English Speakers Cannot Understand Basic Grammar](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100706082156.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)).

[Gender Gap Persists at Highest Levels of Math and Science Testing, 30-Year Study Finds](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100706113210.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Twice as many males as females obtain a perfect 800 on the mathematics SAT.

[Genetic structure of cattle in Eurasia](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/07/genetic-structure-of-cattle-in-eurasia.html). It’s fascinating to see how our domesticates seem to track and correlate with population movements. It’s like humans and their domesticates are a movable ecology.
