ScienceBlogs has good blogs

I don’t have real value to add on the [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/) controversy. The only thing I want to mention is that there are some nascent superstar weblogs on that network which aren’t big names, *yet*, but perhaps will be. You can miss them coming in via the front page because they don’t crank out 10-15 posts per day, but they make them count when they do post. Two new weblogs which have caught my attention are [Thoughtful Animals](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/) and [Observations of a Nerd](http://scienceblogs.com/observations/). There are others too if you poke around (your disciplinary focus may differ).

At this point I think for some people ScienceBlogs is not a the optimal venue. Obviously I was one of those people, as I left in late March. But for other people the reach of a prominent network still has utility. No need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. So by all means, let’s keep [track of the *SB* Diaspora](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/07/07/oh-pepsi-what-hath-thou-wrought/), but there are also diamonds in the rough who aren’t budging.
