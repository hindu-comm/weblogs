Privacy as a bourgeois privilege

[Ruchira Paul](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2010/11/gnashing-white-teeth-and-looking-down-a-pretty-nose.html) has her own reaction to Zadie Smith’s [pretentious review](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/) of *The Social Network*. One of the aspects of Smith’s review which Ruchira focuses upon is her concern about the extinction of the “private person.” I have mooted this issue before, but I think it might be worthwhile to resurrect an old hobby-horse of mine: **is privacy as we understand it in the “modern age” simply a function of the transient gap between information technology and mass society?** In other words, for most of human history we lived in small bands or in modest villages. These were worlds where everyone was in everyone else’s business. There was very little privacy because the information technology was well suited to the scale of such societies. That “technology” being our own innate psychology and verbal capacities. With the rise of stratified cultures elites could withdraw into their own castles, manses and courtyards, veiled away from the unwashed masses. A shift toward urbanization, and greater anonymity made possible by the rise of the mega-citywithin the last few centuries, has allowed the common citizen to also become more of a stranger to their neighbors. It is far easier to shed “baggage” by simply moving to a place where everyone *doesn’t* know your name.

Or it was. Today neighbors can dig through the information trail you’ve left in the great data cloud. You can’t lie about your age if you give people your real name, it’s easy to find it on various services. You can’t lie about where you are from, the same services usually track that too. Classmates.com can allow someone to confirm whether you actually graduated from the secondary school you claim to have graduated from. If you have left your Facebook friends list open then they can quickly see what sort of people you associate with. It takes 10 seconds to find out how much your house is worth on Zillow, what taxes you’ve paid on it, how much you’ve purchased it for, and, if you have a lien against you. If you dressed up like a [ladybug](http://www.fitsnews.com/2010/10/29/odonnells-ladybug-love/) for Halloween then everyone may know.

The power of the new technologies was brought home to me last weekend. Amos Zeeberg, *Discover Magazine*‘s web editor, mentioned my comment moderation style on a panel at a conference in New York City. Someone in the audience tweeted what Amos had said about me, and I saw the tweet since she added @razibkhan to her message. Five years ago I may have heard about this, but only later on from one of the other people in the audience, or another panelist. But there would have been a fair amount of latency. Now the information got to me in \~15 minutes. Not only did I see the tweet, but so did everyone else who was a follower of that individual.

**The world is turning into a village.** But only from your own perspective; in the aggregate there are *millions* of distinctive villages.
