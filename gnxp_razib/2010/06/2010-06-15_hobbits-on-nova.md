Hobbits on NOVA

This looks interesting, [Aliens from Earth](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hobbit/):

> An ancient legend on the Indonesian island of Flores tells of an > elflike creature similar to the fictional hobbit of novels and film. > But a controversial 2003 archeological find not only suggests that > there could be some truth behind the legend but promises to rewrite a > key chapter in the human evolutionary story. This program investigates > the discovery, analysis, and startling implications of the hobbit of > Flores.

Airs tonight in the USA.
