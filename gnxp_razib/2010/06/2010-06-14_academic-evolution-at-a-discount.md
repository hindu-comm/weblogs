Academic evolution at a discount

I was at the bookstore today and noticed that [Evolution—the Extended Synthesis](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262513676/geneexpressio-20/), edited by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller, was pretty affordable for an academically oriented work. I think readers of this weblog will find many of its chapters of interest (the Amazon review was pretty weird by the way, and I don’t think it reflects the book very well).
