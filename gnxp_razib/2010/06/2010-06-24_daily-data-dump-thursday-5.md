Daily Data Dump – Thursday

[This Doctor Does What to 6-Year-Old Girls’ Clitorises?](http://www.slate.com/id/2257987/?from=rss) This reminds me of the possibly apocryphal story of a pediatrician being attacked in England because a really stupid outraged person was opposed to pedophilia. Here’s a sentence for the ages: ” Because much as Savage might like it to be, the world is not yet a place where most little girls can have a clitoris that looks like a penis and feel entirely at ease.” I think the intersex have been subject to such misrepresentation historically that advocates for this group should really focus on being true to the facts and not appealing to emotions.

[Caring About Strangers](http://secularright.org/SR/wordpress/?p=4215). I recall years ago that the Christian Rock group Jars of Clay collaborated on a concert with liberal Hollywood-based organizations to raise consciousness about religious intolerance and persecution in China. Jars of Clay naturally was focused on the Protestant “House Churches,” while Hollywood was focused on Tibetan Buddhists. Both instances of persecution were, and are, real, but which one you focus on is obviously determined by your own world-view and sympathies.

[Consumer Genetics Needs More Transparency, Not Excessive Regulation](http://www.xconomy.com/national/2010/06/23/consumer-genetics-needs-more-transparency-not-excessive-regulation/). In general I agree. I suppose my null or default position is *not* to regulate this sort of thing. Those who wish to regulate need to make their case, as opposed to fear-mongering.

[Gore Was Accused of Sexual Advances](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/us/politics/24gore.html?hp). [Excelsior!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wmczxnT3c)

[Are High Glycemic Index Carbs Worse Than Saturated Fat?](http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/2010/06/are_high_glycemic_index_carbs.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss) “…swapping saturated fat for carbs with a high glycemic index (e.g. 5% lower calories from saturated fat, and 5% increased calories from high GI carbs) was associated with a 33% increased heart attack risk.”
