You have no privacy, deal with it

*The Washington Post*‘s blogger-journalist [Dave Weigel](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/an_apology_to_my_readers.html?wprss=right-now) has a [post up](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/an_apology_to_my_readers.html?wprss=right-now) where he preemptively apologizes for stuff he posted on an “off-the-record” e-list,. Extracts are going to be published by a gossip site. Journalists are the tip of the iceberg; **privacy is fast becoming a total fiction, remember that.** We’re slowly drifting toward David Brin’s model of a [“transparent society”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society), but it’s happening so fluidly that people aren’t even noticing. And yet as I have noted before, people are [resisting the push](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/death-of-email-death-of-facebook/) to merge all their *personas* into one. Interesting times.
