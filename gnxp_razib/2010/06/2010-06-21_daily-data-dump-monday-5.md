Daily Data Dump – Monday

[I won the 3 Quarks Daily Science Prize. ‘Top quark’. Heh.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/06/21/i-won-the-3-quarks-daily-science-prize-top-quark-heh/) “I” = Ed Yong. ‘nuf said.

[Brown-eyed men perceived to be more dominant](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/06/brown-eyed-men-perceived-to-be-more.html). Dienekes offers up a more banal explanation, that the disjunction between blue vs. brown-eyed males in dominance perception has to do with a correlation that’s a holdover from past population differences which are being eliminated through admixture. Plausible enough to me, excepting that I do wonder at models which presume that continental populations were ever so isolated.

[Chimpanzees murder for land](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/06/21/chimpanzees-murder-for-land/). In biology Malthus was right. Intrapspecific competition is the norm quite often because of reproduction up to the carrying capacity. This is why I think [Brian Ferguson’s](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~socant/brian.htm) idea that war is a product of agriculture is highly naive; hunter-gatherers were up at their carrying capacity as well.

[Bernie Madoff, Free at Last](http://nymag.com/news/crimelaw/66468/?loc=interstitialskip). Celebrity sociopath.

[If it’s OK to reject blood from gay men, what about blacks?](http://www.slate.com/id/2257655/?from=rss) Will Saletan takes things to their logical conclusion to undermine the premise.
