Daily Data Dump – Monday

[High Rates of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Older Swingers](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100623212635.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). This goes into the “they had to do research!?!?!” category. Older swingers are a “high risk” group, like gay men and prostitutes.

[Golly, Beav, We’re Historic](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/arts/television/27beaver.html?hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1277686878-QQWrJKOiQxFM+KZ+hAhrZw). I really loved *Leave It To Beaver* when I was a kid.

[Religious Extremists Will Inherit the Earth](http://www.takimag.com/article/religous_extremists_will_inherit_the_earth/). John Derbyshire reviews the new book [Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846681448/geneexpressio-20). I’m looking forward to this book, though I’m generally skeptical of the error bars on any social prediction beyond the 20 year time horizon.

[Born to be a slave in Niger](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4250709.stm). This a story from 2005, but from what I gather nothing has really changed in much of the Sahel since then. Slavery is particularly pernicious in [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Mauritania), where the racialized aspect is pretty straightforward.

[New Clues Suggest Wet Era on Early Mars Was Global](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100624141343.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher). This story caught my attention because I just found out that Edgar Rice Burrough’s first [Barsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carter_of_Mars_(film)) novel is going to be turned into a film.
