The ways of the forefathers & foremothers

Fascinating [post](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/culture/phylogenetics-cultural-evolution-and-horizontal-transmission) by [Bayes](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/culture/phylogenetics-cultural-evolution-and-horizontal-transmission), [Phylogenetics, cultural evolution and horizontal transmission](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/culture/phylogenetics-cultural-evolution-and-horizontal-transmission):

I think the point that horizontal transmission may be less important relative to vertical transmission than we’d previously thought in regards to the spread and diffusion of cultures may explain [some of the recent findings from DNA extractions which suggest that hunter-gatherers were replaced in Europe by farmers](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/03/the-science-of-human-history-as-written-by-herodotus/). The standard model before the recent wave of extractions was that farming spread through cultural diffusion, with a minority view championed by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza of “demic diffusion” whereby demographic growth from the point of origination spread a culture, though the initial distinctive genetic signal became progressively weaker through dilution via admixture. But if cultural practices such as agriculture were much more vertically transmitted, from parent to child, rather than horizontally across societies, the genetic pattern of replacement becomes more comprehensible.

Of course, the main caveat is that intermarriage has been very common between neighboring groups. The [rape of the Sabine women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women) may reflect a common practice on the part of migratory males; the Greek colonization of the western Mediterranean was almost all male, so the subsequent generations were biologically the products of Greek men and native women (though culturally they were fully Greek, as evidenced by the term “Magna Graecia” to refer to Sicily and southern Italy). It is not atypical for vertical transmission of culture to occur from one parent, and in particular one sex. More recently the descendants of the pairings of Iberian men and indigenous women in Latin America tend to speak Spanish and avow the Christian faith. Though aspects of local identity, such as cuisine and clothing, may retain an indigenous stamp it is no coincidence that these populations are labelled “*Latin* American” despite their mixed genetic provenance.

**Note:** In the United States children have traditionally been more often raised in the denomination of their mother than father, so there isn’t always a male-bias in vertical transmission when the parents are not concordant for a cultural trait.
