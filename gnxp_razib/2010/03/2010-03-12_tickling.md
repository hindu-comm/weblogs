Tickling

Did not [know this](http://www.slate.com/id/2247671/):

> Still, these platonic tickle sessions appear to be rare. Based on a > survey he conducted for his fascinating book Laughter, neuroscientist > Robert Provine **notes that adults and adolescents are seven times > more likely to be tickled by members of the opposite sex**. When asked > whom they would most like to be tickled by, there was a fifteenfold > disparity. Provine also notes that “the Dutch word for clitoris is > kittelaar, ‘the organ of being tickled or titillated.’ ” The Internet > is littered with tickle fetish sites. >
> … >
> Nevertheless, Robert Provine notes that history and mythology tell > tales of death by tickle. The Leshii, a Russian fairy-tale monster, > abducted peasants and tickled them to death. The Rusalka, drowned > maidens of Ukrainian lore who populate inland waterways, tempted > bypassing bachelors and delivered fatal tickle attacks. Real-life > Prince Vlad—yes, that Vlad—of Transylvania may have tortured victims > by dripping salty water onto their feet and letting goats lick it off. > **English rebel Simon de Montfort reportedly tickled opponents to > death with a feather, and an Anabaptist sect uncomfortable with > bloodshed is also alleged to have used the method.** Provine suggests > one possible mechanism for death-by-tickle: “The sustained, > uncontrollable laughter and struggling of the victim may cause cardiac > arrest or cerebral hemorrhage.”

There’s a lot more to tickling than I thought!
