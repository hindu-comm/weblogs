Billion year contract

[This is funny](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/us/07scientology.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

> Raised as Scientologists, Christie King Collbran and her husband, > Chris, were recruited as teenagers to work for the elite corps of > staff members who keep the Church of Scientology running, known as the > Sea Organization, or Sea Org.  
> **They signed a contract for a billion years** — in keeping with the > church’s belief that Scientologists are immortal. They worked seven > days a week, often on little sleep, for sporadic paychecks of \$50 a > week, at most.

Check this conclusion:

> Ms. Collbran says she still believes in Scientology — not in the > church as it is now constituted, but in its teachings. She still gets > auditing, from other Scientologists who have defected, like Mr. > Rathbun.  
> Mr. Davis said there is no such thing: “One can’t be a Scientologist > and not be part of the church.”  
> Mr. Collbran, for his part, wants nothing to do with his former > church. “Eventually I realized I was part of a con,” he said, “and I > have to leave it and get on with my life.”  
> Despite all they have been through together, Ms. and Mr. Collbran are > getting a divorce. The reason, they agree sadly, is that they no > longer see eye to eye on Scientology.

No surprise that some individuals who are abused by Scientology want to “reform it.” Look at the history of [Millerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerism).
