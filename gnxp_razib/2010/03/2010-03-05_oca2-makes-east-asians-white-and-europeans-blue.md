OCA2 makes East Asians white and Europeans blue

The major reason is that that’s where the money is; unlike height, let alone intelligence, the [genetic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_architecture) and evolutionary history of pigmentation has been elucidated with relative clarity. That is, we know roughly the number and nature of the genes which control much of the between population variation in pigmentation. And, we also have some sense of whether the variation is due to natural selection, as well the historical trajectory of the between population differences.  
For example, consider the [HERC2](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=herc2+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search)–[OCA2](https://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&safe=off&client=pub-5976931228913298&cof=FORID:13;AH:left;S:http://scienceblogs.com;CX:ScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine;L:http://scienceblogs.com/channel/img/logo_science-blogs.gif;LH:66;LP:1;VLC:%23551a8b;DIV:%23cccccc;&adkw=AELymgU_cMkYx3XYaxrJaz5HNwKGd_rTrZTrINxGxblTknkMnR85WfwhnZMqnqnYps_VVPJx78WLtP19Ght9FjML-QUdaSthdEP6lwJSUC90ltjRb93siPBQGBXEIhKS6pTMbljdhbddECAcPk_P3ltLhyHWFw9hTYQ7QDXMKMeTt2YNeNGqwx8wYEHhIx1MXebSLAkJhgoBfUxKUkMxKcHhlqbn6xmaIA&boostcse=0&q=oca2+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&btnG=Search&cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0) region of the genome in West Eurasians. It is responsibe for \~75% of the variation in blue vs. non-blue eye color. It also seems to be responsible for some variation in skin complexion. This makes sense, as one would presume that different pigmentation related phenotypes would be controlled by the same set of genes. Finally, the genomic region is characterized by a very long haplotype, which might be an indication of rather recent natural selection driving one variant to high frequency. More plainly, it seems probable that the genetic variants around *HERC2-OCA2* which are correlated with light eye colors rose to high frequency with the last 10,000 years or so.  
![ss_101152509.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/ss_101152509.jpg?resize=200%2C266)![ss_101152509.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/ss_101152509.jpg?resize=200%2C266)A major reason we have such clarity on these issues is that **only a handful of genes seem to be responsible for most of the between-population variation in pigmentation.** This was expected from older studies using classical genetic techniques, see [The Genetics of Human Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20/). But theory is one thing, science has a way of upsetting expectations. This is one case where new techniques have solidified and fleshed out the inferences of the old. But there is a twist in the simple story, though there seems to be only one way that humans are dark in regards to genetic architecture, there are at least two ways to be pale. More precisely West Eurasians and East Eurasians seem to have developed lighter complexions by different genetic pathways in relatively recent evolutionary time. As an example, the derived variant of *SLC24A5* is present at very high frequencies across West Eurasia, and is responsible for 20-40% of the difference in complexion between Europeans and Africans, and around 35% of the variation in complexion among South Asians. But, Africans and East Asians have the ancestral variant. Obviously Africans and East Asians have very different complexions, so there must be other variants which East Asians carry which have not been detected.  
Though genome-wide analyses have pinpointed many genes implicated in pigmentation pathways as having been targets of selection in East Asians there have been relatively few association studies which see if those genes actually correlate with pigmentation with East Asian populations. Today *PLoS Genetics* published a paper which does just that, [Association of the OCA2 Polymorphism His615Arg with Melanin Content in East Asian Populations: Further Evidence of Convergent Evolution of Skin Pigmentation](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000867?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosgenetics/NewArticles+(PLoS+Genetics:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

Their method here was simple, they focused on pigmentation genes which have given positive signals in tests of natural selection, and ran an [association](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/linkage-versus-association-mini-primer.php) analysis. The sample size was small, on the order of the low hundreds, and they had individuals from the core East Asian nations as well as some Indochinese.  
Here is the effect of *OCA2* SNP in question (substitutions of the derived from left to right):  
![journal.pgen.1000867.g001.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/journal.pgen.1000867.g001.png?resize=500%2C499)![journal.pgen.1000867.g001.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/journal.pgen.1000867.g001.png?resize=500%2C499)  
The effect is roughly “co-dominant,” each substitution of the G allele, which is ancestral, with the A allele, which is derived, has a significant lightening effect on the phenotype. The heterozygote is 1.6 melanin units lighter than GG, and the AA is 2.6 melanin units lighter than GG. For comparison, in African Americans (who are admixed between West Africans and Europeans) for *SLC24A5* GG versus AG and GG versus AA genotypes were separated by about 7 and 9.5 melanin units, respectively. While *SLC24A5* can explain 20-40% of the variance between Europeans and Africans, this SNP on *OCA2* can explain only 10% of the variance within East Asians.  
Here is the conclusion of their discussion:

It is not surprising that there is an SNP within *OCA2* associated with pigment variation. A lot of the genes implicated in population X are often implicated in population Y (e.g., *SLC24A5* is a cross-West Eurasian gene in terms of its effect on skin color). In fact, many genes implicated in species X and often implicated in species Y (*SLC24A5* started out in a fish model). *OCA2* and its flanking genes have a lot to do with pigmentation in Europeans, so that should increase the probability that might do the same in East Asians. Additionally, doing simple comparisons of between population differences in allele frequencies on *OCA2* shows large differences between light and dark skinned groups generally. Finally, I suspected that much of the action was going to be on different alleles/SNPs on the same small set of genes. Though most of the genes implicated in skin lightened are *roughly* additive/co-dominant in effect, that is, heterozygotes have a phenotype between the two homozygotes, there tends to be a “light” allele partial dominance on some of these genes. I’m thinking here especially of *KITLG* and *SLC24A5*. If East Asians and Europeans had genetic differences on all their skin lightening genes, and there was some dominance in effect of these alleles, then Eurasians should be quite ghostly indeed! To my knowledge this isn’t what’s occurring. If the alleles are on the same genes, even if they’re of different allele variants their effect is the same and they can’t *both* be partially dominant. Of course I wouldn’t put great stock in the architecture I’m assuming here, especially since I’m a bit perplexed how loss of function mutations would have a dominant effect on melanin index (molecular geneticists step forward!). But for what it’s worth, you see the same effect with this SNP in *OCA2*, diminishing returns in the AA homozygote.
