Alcoholism, genes, and genetic background

PNAS has a [new study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/03/01/0911109107.abstract) out on the “modest” association between *GABRA2* and “alcohol dependence.” The odds ratios pretty weak. But what struck me is that the populations they looked at was mostly European and African American. I wonder why these research programs just don’t focus on Native Ameicans; who are operationally an [admixed](http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/Section%201.htm) population (European + Native American) and manifest a lot of alcohol dependence.
