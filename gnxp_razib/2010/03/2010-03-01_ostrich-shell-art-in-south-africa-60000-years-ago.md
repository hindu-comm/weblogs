Ostrich shell art in South Africa 60,000 years ago

There’s a new paper in PNAS reviewing the tradition of etching on ostrich shells. Since it’s PNAS, the paper isn’t on the website, but ~~[Edward](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/an_60000-year_old_artistic_movement_recorded_in_ostrich_egg.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss)~~ [Edmund Yong](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/an_60000-year_old_artistic_movement_recorded_in_ostrich_egg.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss) is able to cover the [major points](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/an_60000-year_old_artistic_movement_recorded_in_ostrich_egg.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss) thanks to his [access](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/02/why_dont_the_links_in_your_posts_work.php). This stuff is of interest because there was a long time lag between the emergence of anatomically modern humans in Africa, and their subsequent expansion out of Africa \~50,000 years ago, the crystallization of “behavioral modernity.”
