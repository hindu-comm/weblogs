Twins in Kerala

[The strange case of the twins of Kodinji](http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100313/MAGAZINE/703129992/1284/ART):

> The latest survey, from December 2009, counted 265 pairs of twins in > the village, which is home to about 3,000 families and 13,000 > inhabitants. This equates to a twinning rate of about 30 to 35 per > 1,000 live births within a radius of about 500 metres. The average in > the rest of the country is 8.1 per 1,000 live births.  
> …  
> Unlike in Cândido Godói, consanguineous (blood-related) marriages are > not a factor in the Kodinji twin phenomenon. “The majority of the > population is Muslim, but the incidences of twinning are present even > among the small minority of Hindu families,” Sribiju explains. “More > importantly, brides who are not originally from Kodinji are giving > birth to twins after they move to the village.”
