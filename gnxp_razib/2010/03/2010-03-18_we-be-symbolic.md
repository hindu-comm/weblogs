We be symbolic

[The Evolution Of Symbolic Language](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/03/the_evolution_of_symbolic_lang.html) by Terrence Deacon and Ursula Goodenough. Deacon’s [The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317544/geneexpressio-20/) is a book I liked a great deal, though in hindsight I don’t think I had the background to appreciate it in any depth (nor do I now).
