Heterozygote advantage in resistance to tuberculosis

[The lta4h Locus Modulates Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Infection in Zebrafish and Humans](http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867410001285#Summary):

> Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces varied early outcomes, > ranging from resistance to infection to progressive disease. Here we > report results from a forward genetic screen in zebrafish larvae that > identify multiple mutant classes with distinct patterns of innate > susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum. A hypersusceptible mutant > maps to the lta4h locus encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase, which > catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a > potent chemoattractant and proinflammatory eicosanoid. lta4h mutations > confer hypersusceptibility independent of LTB4 reduction, by > redirecting eicosanoid substrates to anti-inflammatory lipoxins. The > resultant anti-inflammatory state permits increased mycobacterial > proliferation by limiting production of tumor necrosis factor. **In > humans, we find that protection from both tuberculosis and > multibacillary leprosy is associated with heterozygosity for LTA4H > polymorphisms that have previously been correlated with differential > LTB4 production.** Our results suggest conserved roles for balanced > eicosanoid production in vertebrate resistance to mycobacterial > infection.

Figure 6C has a mortality curves for patiens from meningeal TB:

Interestingly, heterozygote advantage against tuberculosis has been [offered as the reason for the high frequency of the cystic fibrosis allele in Europeans](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10013-cystic-fibrosis-gene-protects-against-tuberculosis.html). TB has been around for [at least 10,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis#History).
