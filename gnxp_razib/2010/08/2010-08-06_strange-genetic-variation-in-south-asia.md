Strange genetic variation in South Asia

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/08/genome-wide-study-of-indian-men.html) has a [post up](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/08/genome-wide-study-of-indian-men.html) where he highlights the fact that the recent paper on [South Asian metabolic diseases](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011961) has a figure which elucidates population structure within the region. Accounting for structure is important for genome-wide associations since you might get a spurious correlations if trait value/disease frequency is simply tracking cryptic population variation. Dienekes says:

The second issue is easily addressed. The Christian outliers are both give English as their native language. That suggests to me that they’re [Anglo-Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian), a community of mixed South Asian and European origin. South Asian Muslims are overwhelmingly [of indigenous origin](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/10/the-mostly-south-asian-origins-of-indian-muslims/). But, a minority of the Muslim elite are West Asian, or have substantial West Asian ancestry, as is evident by the fact that they look white. [Benazir Bhutto’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto) mother was of Kurdish and Persian ethnic background (her family was from Esfahan in Iran). I’ve reedited the religious & linguistic PC plots to fit onto the screen.

So what’s going on with the cluster which extends along the second principal component? The first component is probably just a European/West Asian-South Asian axis of variation. But I don’t understand where the variation for the second is coming from. **Observe that the one South Indian group, Tamil speakers, are not represented in the secondary cluster.** The plot reminded me of something I saw last fall.

Below is figure S4 is from the supplements of [Reconstructing Indian population history](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html). I added some labels. The Indian cluster is tight when the genetic variation includes non-Indian groups. But, when you constrain the variation to Europeans and South Asians only, something strange happens:

The Gujarati sample is from Houston, and is from HapMap Phase 3. I have a suspicion that the secondary cluster among the Gujaratis here is of the same class of phenomenon as the secondary cluster in the first plot. The Anglo-Indians and West Asian Muslims serve as rough proxies for Europeans, and you have an expected European-South Asian axis. But you also have this strange orthogonal component. I had assumed that the plot from the Reich et al. paper was an anomaly, but I’m not so sure seeing the second paper.
