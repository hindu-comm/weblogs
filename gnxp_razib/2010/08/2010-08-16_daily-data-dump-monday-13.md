Daily Data Dump – Monday

[Dogs’ Family Status Depends on Family’s Locale](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100815162124.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). “People who think of their pets as their children often re-evaluate this thought when they have human children of their own.”

[The Politics of Ideas : Hauser Gone Wild](http://scientopia.org/blogs/childsplay/2010/08/the-politics-of-ideas-theres-something-rotten-in-the-state-of-denmark/). “Must read” post on “Hausergate.”

He sometimes [comments on this weblog](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/the-three-layers-of-the-neandertal-cake/#comment-23033).

[Secret Assault on Terrorism Widens on Two Continents](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/world/15shadowwar.html?pagewanted=print). I’m surely wrong abut this, but something about BHO’s geopolitical strategy smells to me of LBJ’s gradual escalation in Vietnam. Why do Democrats always have to prove that they’re bad-asses?
