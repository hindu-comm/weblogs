Daily Data Dump – Wednesday

[Elite Isolation](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/08/elite-isolation/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+matthewyglesias+(Matthew+Yglesias)). This is a specific instance of a general problem. The rulers as a rule are not sampled randomly from the population. Operationally democracy often seems to turn into competitions between rival elites who are making the “best offer” to segments of the electorate.

[Children and Stress](http://www.slate.com/id/2262309/pagenum/all/#p2). The article connects childhood stress with later life outcomes. In a novel turn the authors attempt to explore the possible biophysical processes which might lead to such a correlation. But the major problem for me is that it doesn’t give weight to the fact that the genetic correlation between parent and child will are probably accounts for much of the association between abuse and abuser.

  
[A Dog’s Eye View of Morphological Diversity](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000452?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosbiology/NewArticles+(PLoS+Biology:+New+Articles)). PLoS commissioned an particle on the [paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/the-dogs-world-of-large-effect-qtls/) I reviewed as well.

[Delayed Gratification = Success?](http://sciblogs.co.nz/skepticon/2010/08/10/delayed-gratification-success/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingSocialScienceEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Social+Science)). Perhaps. I am generally skeptical of the idea that the less intelligent can become more intelligent, but, it seems to me plausible that the impulsive can develop habits to dampen their tendencies.

From now on \#5 every day will be something from Google public [data explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/home). Here are GDP per capita for selected Latin American nations + China since 1980.
