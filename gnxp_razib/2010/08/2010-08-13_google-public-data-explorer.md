Google Public Data Explorer

One of the main issues that we as human beings have is that we don’t have a *gestalt* understanding of social data, and its change over time. Among biologists one of the major recurring problems is the gloominess which is a consequence of the Malthusian mindset (which is understandable because of their professional bias) which has a hard time understanding that the human species is far healthier and wealthier today than it was in 1960. Below the fold is something I cobbled together in 30 seconds with [Google’s public data explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=b&strail=false&nselm=s&met_x=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&scale_y=log&ind_y=false&idim=country:KOR:AFG:WBG:ZAF&ifdim=country&pit=1199145600000&hl=en&dl=en&iconSize=0.5&uniSize=0.035000000000000024). On the y-axis is the log-transformed total fertility rate, and the x-axis the life expectancy. I’ve highlighted a few polities to show different trajectories since 1960.
