Daily Data Dump – Monday

Hope you had a good weekend.

[Scientopia](http://scientopia.org/blogs/). New blog network. Mark Chu-Carroll of [Good Math, Bad Math](http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/) is the tech admin. He’s a Google engineer, so he’s got game. Lots of familiar faces on the blog list.

[Field of Science](http://www.fieldofscience.com/). I just noticed that the commenter who I think of as “Scissors Michelle” now has [moved her blog to this network](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com). I’m familiar with it because it hosts one of my favorite social science weblogs, [Epiphenom](http://epiphenom.fieldofscience.com/). There’s other stuff there worth checking out.

[Pushing towards acknowledging sex differences in physiology and treatment efficacy](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com/2010/08/pushing-towards-acknowledging-sex.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingBiologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Biology)). I’m obviously of the class of person who takes human biological variation seriously. Sex differences in physiology and medicine seem like the lowest hanging fruit there is, but the fact that it needs to be mooted is commentary on the state of affairs (though I assume that some of this is that researchers just don’t want to reduce the sample size of their treatment groups if they feel like they don’t have to).

[How well can a screening test predict disease risk?](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/08/predictive-capacity-of-screening-tests.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+GenomesUnzipped+(Genomes+Unzipped)) You’ve probably heard all about the low value-add of DTC kits when it comes to risk profiles for diseases. This post digs deeper into the technical reasons why this often occurs.

[Armarium Magnum](https://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/). Book reviews of ancient and medieval history. The [survey of the shift in Rodney Stark’s ouvre](https://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/2010/05/gods-battalions-case-for-crusades-by.html) sounds about right to me. We’ve read many of the same books, and his reviews align with my own impressions and assessments. So of course I think he’s the bomb.
