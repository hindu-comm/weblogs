Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

[Genetic Components and Cultural Differences: The social sensitivity hypothesis](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/genetics/genetic-components-and-cultural-differences-the-social-sensitivity-hypothesis/comment-page-1). The frequency of genes and “memes” change in very different ways. As I have long observed while memes can be passed from only one parent, genes are constricted in sexual reproduction to being inherited in part from both parents. How the two may relate (e.g., lactase persistence), and the causal direction of that relation, is going to be interesting to flesh out in the next generation.

[Demographic Disparities Found Among Children With Frequent Ear Infections](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100809161232.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Sometimes when I see stuff like this I wonder, “is this another article about how colored people bite?” Nope. “frequent ear infections plague white children and children living below the poverty level more than children of other racial or ethnic backrounds or income levels.”

  
[Virginia May Nab Serial Rapist Through Blood Relative DNA](http://abcnews.go.com/News/TheLaw/familial-dna-expose-east-coast-rapist/story?id=11334748). Wow, things move fast. Looks like someone has introduced legislation to allow the FBI to do this sort of thing too.

[Population admixture, biological invasions and the balance between local adaptation and inbreeding depression](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/07/29/rspb.2010.1272.full). Open access *and* accessible.

[Pets Vital to Human Evolution : Discovery News](http://news.discovery.com/animals/pets-humans-evolution.html). Humans are the technological species, but much of our technology is biological in the form of our domesticates. But physical and biological technology are fundamentally different in some ways, because biology has more proximate (neurological) and ultimate (evolutionary) agency.
