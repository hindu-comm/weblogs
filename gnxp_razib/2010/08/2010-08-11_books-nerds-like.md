Books nerds like

The [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kk/book_recommendations/) community is [having a book discussion](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2kk/book_recommendations/) and offering up recommendations. I’m currently reading [Lives of Confucius: Civilization’s Greatest Sage Through the Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385510691/geneexpressio-20) (long time readers will know that I’m a particular fan of [Xun Zi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xun_Zi) though). It is revising my view of the “received orthodoxy” as to the development of state sponsored Confucianism during the Han dynasty. A good complement to [The Authentic Confucius](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003D7JVUC/geneexpressio-20), which is less a historical work and more a religio-philosophical exegesis of the sage’s life. I did finish [Empires of the Word](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060935723/geneexpressio-20), but I will review it at some point so I won’t say more than I would recommend it, though with a critical eye.
