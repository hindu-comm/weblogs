Open thread – August 8th, 2010

Didn’t get to looking into papers from last week’s open thread…but I will. But as usual, comments, links, etc. While I have your attention, my twitter feed is [here](https://twitter.com/razibkhan). I don’t post what I’m eating or anything, but it’s another way to get a feed of all my posts.
