Daily Data Dump ‚Äì Thursday

[Essential Science Fiction Movies](http://scientopia.org/blogs/galacticinteractions/2010/08/25/essential-science-fiction-movies/). People always put [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(film)) on the list, or bemoan the fact that they haven‚Äôt seen it. What do you think of it? I quite enjoyed, but much of the greatness of the film seems to be that it prefigured so much of what was to come.

[The Real Estate Collapse](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/the-real-estate-collapse/). Jonah Lehrer suggests that the problem with prices *not* declining (or at least listed prices) has a lot to do with loss aversion/sunk cost fallacy. I agree. On the other hand, many Americans who are older bought into the idea that real estate was the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place to put their savings, and now are looking at taking a big loss. If you have 15-30 good years left it might be really hard to simply ‚Äúmove on‚Äù when you don‚Äôt have the time left to rebuild equity.

  
[Our advice re: donations for Pakistan flood](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/08/25/our-advice-re-donations-for-pakistan-flood/). The idea is to get the most bang-for-your-buck. From what I have heard \~20 million people have been impacted by the floods. I guess it gives you a sense of what a Pakistani peasant‚Äôs life is worth to the world.

[Generation X More Loyal to Religion](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100826083620.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). This looks more likely to just be the law of diminishing returns. The disaffection of the Baby Boomers from organized religion correlates with a relaxation of social norms. The distribution of religiosity among Gen-X probably more accurately reflects their individual preferences.

[This Hauser thing is getting hard to watch](http://www.neuronculture.com/http:/www.neuronculture.com/archives/this-hauser-thing-is-getting-hard-to-watch). David Dobbs reviews some of the issues with *l‚Äôaffaire* Hauser. Basically everyone who is a blogger of note seems to be getting emails from people who wish to remain anonymous. Draw whatever conclusions you want to from that.
