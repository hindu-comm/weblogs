Daily Data Dump – Thursday

[Which population is most genetically distant from Africans?](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/08/which-population-is-most-genetically.html). Dienekes argues that Amerindians are the furthest not due to bottlenecks, but because of isolation from gene flow. He points to particular markers which span Africa and Eurasia. I know of the one he’s talking about. I need to rethink whether the first approximation of no major gene flow since Out-of-Africa (OoA) except for recent historical migration is useful, mostly because I haven’t familiarized myself with the literature well enough.

[Inferring Geographic Coordinates of Origin for Europeans Using Small Panels of Ancestry Informative Markers](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011892?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosone/GeneticsandGenomics+(PLoS+ONE+Alerts:+Genetics+and+Genomics)). 500-1000 well selected SNPs are sufficient to narrow down geographical origin of an individual within Europe. I assume that the number would be lower in Africa.

[The effect of ancient population bottlenecks on human phenotypic variation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978547/). Doing with skulls what you do with genes. Same general results.

  
[Time to revise the mtDNA timescale?](http://johnhawks.net/node/14674) What’s a few tens of thousands of years? Well, it matters quite a bit since you need to align genetic with paleoanthropological data. Conflicts between geneticists and anthropologists and paleontologists have been flaring up since the 1960s. Sometimes the geneticists are right, as [Allan Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wilson#Career_and_scientific_contributions) was about the separation between humans and other primates, and sometimes the geneticists are crazy, as Wilson was when some wrong results in his lab indicates that modern humans had their origin in Australia (see [The Monkey Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0370304691/geneexpressio-20), where the authors report this bizarre preliminary result in the conclusion to tantalize the readers. The source was Allan Wilson, and it was just crazy on the face of it).

[People With No Religious Affiliation Have Less Favorable Views of the US](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100817131006.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Being irreligious makes you unpatriotic, but being an ethnic minority does not. This may not be generalizable across nations, I looked at China in [The World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) and religion (or lack of) doesn’t make a difference.
