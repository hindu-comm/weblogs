Daily Data Dump – Thursday

[Nobel-winning brain researcher retracts two papers](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100923/full/news.2010.489.html?s=news_rss). Looks like there’s the typical blame-it-on-the-Asian going on here, so perhaps this won’t blow up.

[In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/in-our-time/) is back. This week: [Imaginary Numbers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tt6b2).

[“200 genes potentially associated with academic performance in schoolchildren”](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/found-genes-that-make-kids-smart/story-e6frg6nf-1225926421510). Most genes of small effect. We’ll see. Don’t get too excited yet, you might be disappointed.

[Through the Language Glass (Part 2)](https://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/09/through-language-glass-part-2.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingAnthropologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Anthropology)). Second part of a review of [Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080508195X/geneexpressio-20/).

[Blogging out of Balance](http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/blogging_out_of_balance/). Dave Munger did some serious legwork on analyzing the data sets available. For what it’s worth 75% of the readers of this weblog are male. 75% of at least some European descent. 60% are irreligious. 80% atheists and agnostics. 1/3 have graduate school degrees. 85% have completed calculus. I’ve done surveys regularly of the readership since 2004 or so, and they’re always 75-85% male, with the other figures about the same. The main difference is that the median reader is becoming more politically liberal.
