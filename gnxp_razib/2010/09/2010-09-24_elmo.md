Elmo!

I didn’t realize that [Elmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmo) is almost 40 years old. Not only that, apparently some “Sesame Street Traditionalists” refer to him as the [“Little Red Menace”](http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_412445.html). Since I haven’t watched the show regularly since the 1980s I don’t have a strong opinion about his influence, malevolent or not, but generally I’m pro-Elmo. He’s not quite in the class of Mickey, but he’s definitely got a spot in the history books at this point. Here’s Elmo in the now nixed Katy Perry video:
