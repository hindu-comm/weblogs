The hobbits were cretins. Perhaps. Or perhaps not

I was thinking a bit about *H. floresiensis* today. Probably my thoughts were triggered by[John Hawks’](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/dinosaur-species-mistakes-2010.html) post on the propensity for paleontologists to be “splitters,” naming new finds as species when they’re not. The issue with *H. floresiensis* is a little more cut & dried: if they weren’t a separate species they were obviously pathological. The original paper on the Flores hobbits came out in 2004. Is it too much to ask for a little clarity here six years on? [Carl Zimmer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/) has covered this story in depth before, so perhaps he’ll have some insights or inside sources who can shed some light at some point in the near future. [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/) was sure that the specimens were pathological in the early days, but he hasn’t said much for a bit now. And from what I hear there are new controversies about [“Ardi”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus#Ardi). I was at a talk years ago where [Tim White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_D._White) played up the importance of fossils as the final word, as opposed to the more indirect inferential methods of statistical genetics, but this is getting ridiculous. After the [Neandertal admixture](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/the-three-layers-of-the-neandertal-cake/) paper and the [Denisova hominin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisova_hominin), genomic inferences are looking pretty good. I assume there’s more coming in the near future (though [Svante Pääbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_P%C3%A4%C3%A4bo) may have kidnapped family members of people working in his lab to gain leverage, so word probably won’t start leaking until a few weeks before the paper breaks). [Ötzi the Iceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi_the_Iceman#Genetic_analysis) is going to have his genome published next year.

With all that as preamble, here’s a new paper,[Post-Cranial Skeletons of Hypothyroid Cretins Show a Similar Anatomical Mosaic as *Homo floresiensis*](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013018). It’s in PLoS ONE, so read it yourself. Does anyone care? I don’t know enough about about anatomy and osteology to make well-informed judgments about these sorts of things, so to the experts I absolutely defer. But frankly some of the experts strike me jokers. Here’s the problem: **I don’t know who the jokers are!**

I just went back and reread some of the press when the hobbit finds were revealed. New member of the human family tree! Evolution rewritten! And so forth. If *H. floresiensis* turns out to be pathological, I don’t know what to think about paleontology. More honestly, I might start slotting the discipline in with social psychology or [macroeconomic modeling](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/09/21/pm-dont-bet-on-economic-forecasting/).
