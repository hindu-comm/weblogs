Daily Data Dump – Monday

Summer is almost over.

[What was malt liquor?](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2010/09/what-was-malt-liquor-by-andrew-rosenblum.html) The history of malt liquor, and also Pabst Blue Ribbon. No idea that malt liquor used to have an upscale association.

The Genetics & Linguistics Of Central Asia. Excellent overview from a somewhat different angle from my own. [Excellent map](http://anthropologynet.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/ethnicities-of-central-asia.png).

  
[Cousin marriage in the UK and genetic testing](http://johnhawks.net/node/14778). John Hawks ruminates with caution and sensitivity. “I’m inclined toward the opinion that people should choose themselves, and technology should facilitate their choices, not foreclose them. **The State may educate, not shouldn’t dictate.** But not everyone agrees, and most argue for some point at which the State should bar people from destructive choices. But where is that, and who should control the information? That’s what’s at stake in genetic testing.” One of the aspects in living in societies where some risks are socialized is that in fact collective “wisdom” can coerce individuals. That’s not a normative *should*, but really more of an *is*. The question is not *should*, but *where*, as in where is the line? In societies where \~30% of the population is obese vs. 1% of the population engaging in cousin marriage, I think the efficacious path of reducing socialized health care expenditures may differ from the politically feasible path. More voters love their twinkies than have the hots for cuz.

[Asian ‘Unicorn’ Photographed for First Time in Over 10 Years](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100917090846.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). There are some still “blank spots” in the map, even for big mammals.
