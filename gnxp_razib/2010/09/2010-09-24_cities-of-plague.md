Cities of plague

I noticed this entry on *Time*‘s [Healthland](http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/23/study-city-life-spreads-disease-but-if-it-doesnt-kill-you/) blog, [Study: City Life Spreads Disease, But If It Doesn’t Kill You…](http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/23/study-city-life-spreads-disease-but-if-it-doesnt-kill-you/). The author ends kind of strangely:

Arabic is a language from what I know, Arabs are a people. So it was *Arab* invasions. Second, the Arabs did not invade India in the 12th century, they invaded Sindh in the 8th century. But Arabs never went further than Sindh, the Muslims who pushed into the rest of India were generally ethnic Turks or Iranians (Afghans in the latter case). Also, there isn’t much evidence that genetically the Arabs had an impact on the Sindh or Spain if you look at phylogeographic research. But there’s a bigger issue which rebuts the question mark introduced here, [in the abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01132.x/abstract) of the original paper they state that they controlled for shared population history!

You can find the [full review of the paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/the-city-that-kills-you-makes-you-strong/) and my own thoughts on the relationship between diseases, cities, and genetics, over at [Discover](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/the-city-that-kills-you-makes-you-strong/). UCL [also put out a press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/ucl-chh092310.php).
