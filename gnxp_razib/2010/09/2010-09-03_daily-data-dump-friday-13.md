Daily Data Dump – Friday

Have a good Labor Day weekend!

[Catholics and the Evolving Cosmos](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703846604575447493644515142.html?KEYWORDS=Humani+Generis). And yet 35% of American Roman Catholics are Creationists according to the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08).

[23andMe kits at some discount](https://www.23andme.com/), with a subscription to the [“personal genome service”](https://www.23andme.com/personalgenomeservice/) for at least 3 months. Normal complete edition is about \$500, with the discount it’s about \$300 + 3 X \$5 = \$315. The personal genome service doesn’t look like much value-add from what I can tell, just a way to get extra money out of you. I assume they’ve calculated that \$5 is a small enough amount that many people won’t unsubscribe after 3 months.

  
[Capsaicin Can Act as Co-Carcinogen, Study Finds; Chili Pepper Component Linked to Skin Cancer](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100902121057.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). The problem is with topical creams. I keep track of this stuff because I eat a lot of spicy food. On the balance it seems that it does more good than bad, so I’m pretty chilled out, so to speak.

[Insight Offered Into Superstitious Behavior](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100902131736.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)) Thinking about death makes people *less* superstitious? Can you think of a better explanation of what’s going on here?

[How Bankruptcy Can Rescue Students from the Debt Trap](http://www.frumforum.com/how-bankruptcy-can-rescue-students-from-the-debt-trap). Yeah, I think this should be an option. The median undergrad is graduating with around a little north of \$20,000 in debt, but there are people way up the scale. It’s a skewed distribution. Too many people think of student loans as “free money.” Actually, it’s *someone’s* money. In fact, it’s your money, whether through direct federal loans and subsidizations, or through the big pool of capital drawing on pension and mutual funds.
