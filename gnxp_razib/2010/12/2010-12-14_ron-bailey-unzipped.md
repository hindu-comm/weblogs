Ron Bailey Unzipped

Over at [Reason](http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/13/ill-show-you-my-genome-will-yo/print) Ron Baily has an excellent piece up, [I’ll Show You My Genome. Will You Show Me Yours?](http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/13/ill-show-you-my-genome-will-yo/print) He reviews his results from two genotyping chips, and has placed his results [online](http://snpedia.com/index.php/User:Ronald_Bailey). I doubt readers of this weblog will learn anything *that* new, though the article might prove illuminating to friends & family. But, some cautions:

  
– Even papers which make it through “peer review” may not be reporting robust results. So Baily reports the breastfeeding & IQ gene-interaction findings…but [the statistics in this might be flawed](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/questioning-breastfeeding-iq-fads2.php). *Reason* should also just tack the [Genomes Unzipped odds ratio post](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/09/getting-even-with-the-odds-ratio.php) to that article. Bailey knows how to interpret the results (with a grain of salt), but I don’t think how important this is comes through in the piece.

– Second, he repeats the argument that genomic screening might make insurance unfeasible:

> In 2008 Karen Pollitz, director of Georgetown University’s Health > Policy Institute, wrote in the journal Managed Care, “Much of life’s > uncertainty about health will become much more known to us, and since > insurance is all about protecting people from the unknown, that will > be a profound change.” So profound that Pollitz thinks it could > ultimately make the insurance industry obsolete….

Unlikely. There’s still a fair amount of randomness in health outcomes. This is probably a function of the stochasticity of development and environment. I think people need to stop repeating this argument (which I found plausible until I thought about it more deeply).

Oh, and a final minor note, Bailey notes that contrary to family rumor he doesn’t have Native American ancestry. I don’t know what Pathway does, but 23andMe really can’t go back more than five generations apparently.
