South Asians too are sons of the farmers?

I mentioned a [few days ago](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/genome-blogging/) that a friend was trying to get together some data to analyze the genetic variation of South Asians. By a [strange coincidence](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2010/12/fine-scale-south-asian-admixture.html) Dienekes just published a more detailed analysis of South Asians…and uncovered something very interesting, though not *that* surprising. Some technical preliminaries:

> A note of caution: The reduced marker set (\~30k) means that a lot of > noise is added in the admixture estimates. In particular, many > individuals are likely to get low-level admixture from population > sources that can be attributed to noise. But, as we will see, the > small marker set does not really affect either the power of the GALORE > approach, or of ADMIXTURE to infer meaningful clusters.

In addition to the various online sources of public data Dienekes got about [a dozen South Asians](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_UOHFTxL-bOA/TQuRoTDA7hI/AAAAAAAAAQ0/wDrPvzTERB4/s1600/admixture_dodecad.png). I was one of those South Asians, DOD075. In many ways I’m a rather standard issue South Asian, similar to Gujaratis, [except that I have a substantial ‘East Asian’ component](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/my-dodecad-results/). More concretely, between 1/6 and 1/7 of my ancestry seems to be of eastern origin, far higher than the norm among South Asians. The rest of my ancestry was mostly South Asian specific, with a minor, but significant ‘West Asian’ component common across northern India.

Rerunning with more data with different samples Dienekes came out with a different set of ancestral components. Of particular interest to me he broke down the East Asian between East Asian proper and Southeast Asian. Below are a selection of populations with ancestral components + me. I’ve also renamed a few components. North Kannadi = Dravidian and Irula = Indian tribal. Indian = Generic Indian. Looking at the [Fst](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_UOHFTxL-bOA/TQuNTsn3q6I/AAAAAAAAAQs/ATgKQ5YHifU/s1600/distance10.png) it seems that Indian endogamy and population bottlenecks has had an effect…look at the North Kannadi distance from everyone else.

Remember that in the previous analysis I was very similar to a Gujarati, except with an East Asian element. My supposition that my ancestry has some connection to Burma seems to be supported by these results. Looking at my balanced ratio between East Asian and Southeast Asian, that is what one might expect from someone of a Burman ethnicity. I am not saying that I have recent Burman ancestry per se. Rather, Ahom, Mizo, Chakma, and a range of tribal populations from the liminal zone between South and Southeast Asia may suffice. The main other option is that I have a great deal of Munda ancestry. Not implausible in light of the likelihood that Munda brought rice agriculture to northeast South Asia, and pre-date Indo-Aryans, and possibly Dravidians, in Bengal. How would I distinguish these possibilities? I’ve ordered [23andMe](http://23andme.com/) kits for both my parents. The most likely candidate for recent Southeast Asian ancestry is my paternal grandfather. If the admixture event was recent, if I have a recent ancestor(s) of “hill tribe” origin, I would expect to see more linked regions of East/Southeast Asian origin than if the admixture was ancient (and so distributed more equitably across DNA strands due to recombination).

But the bigger point of Dienekes’ post is what he terms “Dagestani” ancestry across much of Eurasia. I’ll quote him:

Paul Conroy [observes](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2010/12/fine-scale-south-asian-admixture.html?showComment=1292615160237#c666569682837820451) that on this finer-grained analysis I don’t have any “West Asian” at all. What had previously been West Asian terms out to have been, in my case, a compound of Dagestani + European. I can’t say that I’m that surprised by this. Years ago I noticed that HGDP STRUCTURE analyses were always giving suggestive signs of a [connection between West-Central Eurasia and South Asia](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/02/shadows-of-the-past-in-genes/).

Who were the Indo-Iranians? I lean toward the proposition that they do derive from the [Andronovo culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronovo_culture) of the Eurasian steppe. This would date the entrance and expansion of Indo-Aryans in northern India 3-4,000 years ago. I also [contend that the dominant element of ancestry among modern South Asians is *not* Indo-Aryan](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/09/indians-as-hybrids-a-k-a-aryan-invasion-in-the-house/). Rather, it is an ancient stabilized hybrid of pre-agricultural societies in the Indus valley and Neolithic farmers who originated from what is today western Iran and eastern Anatolia. Therefore, I posit that the “Aryanization” of the Indian subcontinent is properly modeled as the same processes which led to the emergence of an Anatolian and Rumelian Turkish identity; a small elite population which forces a identity shift among the majority.

Back to farming:

The [Irula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irulas) are South Indian tribals, so they are the the closest one can get to South Asian autochthons, and yet even they presumably have a large minor component of “Ancestral North Indian.” The tribal groups in [Reconstructing Indian Population History](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html) all exhibited proportions on the order of \~40% ANI. It seems that agriculture “stalled” in the Indus valley and the highlands to the west for thousands of years in South Asia. During this period of stalling I believe that the farmers absorbed a great deal of genetic material from the indigenous hunter-gatherers, and so produced a “distinctive” Indian genetic profile. More West Eurasian than not, but with a very large dollop of the ancient substrate of southern Eurasia which had a distant, but closer, affinity with that of East Asia. Once social and cultural forces allowed for the rapid expansion of farmers there was a wave of advance from the Indus valley east and south. In the east the proto-Indians would have encountered Mundari speaking groups drifting who practiced rice agriculture, which they also adopted. In the south the proto-Indians would have encountered more hunter-gatherers. Many of the tribal people in India are today facultative hunter-gatherers, herders, and extensive farmers. I believe that these marginal proto-Indian groups assimilated hunter-gatherers more easily than would have otherwise been the case because some of the proto-Indians reverted to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the agriculturally unsuitable highlands of the Deccan and Chota Nagpur. The social boundaries in the uplands of South India were such that the line between hunter-gatherer and farmer was more fluid than elsewhere, explaining the former’s greater genetic impact through intermarriage and assimilation.

This sort of general dynamic probably applies to Indo-Europeans. There is no reason why the original Indo-European tribes could not have been compounds who picked up different ancestral components in their peregrinations. Compare the various Turkic people, Anatolian Turks, Chuvash, and Yakut. All of them have affinities with nearby peoples, despite having a common Turkic culture and genetic component. One notable trend in Europe is that while the French have a minor, but significant West Asian component, the Basque have none of it. Dienekes’ sample is small, but it looks as if Scandinavians have more of this than the Finns. This West Asian component may not have been the dominant one among the Indo-Europeans, but I suspect it was a significant one. If the original speakers of proto-Indo-European did not have it, they likely absorbed early on, just as the West Asians absorbed a native South Asian element in the Indus valley.

Finally, as a general rule of thumb, I would now suggest that the primary way in which hunter-gatherer genes can persist is through an ecological stall on the part of farmers. During the stall gene flow naturally occurs, probably through exchange of females (coercive or not), or the integration of hunter-gatherer males into war-bands or as slaves. Over time the farmers on the frontier have changed genetically, so that when they start expanding rapidly due to a technological or cultural innovation, they share more with the hunter-gatherers whom they supersede than they otherwise would have.
