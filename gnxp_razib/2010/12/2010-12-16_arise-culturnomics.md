Arise culturnomics!

First, read [Ed Yong’s post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/12/16/the-cultural-genome-google-books-reveals-traces-of-fame-censorship-and-changing-languages/#more-3304). There’s real reporting in it. Such as:

Genomics did not mean that genetics disappeared. Broad surveys complement, they don’t substitute. You can read the paper for free at *Science* if you register, [Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/15/science.1199644):

> We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all > books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate > cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of > “culturomics”, focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were > reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how > this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as > lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the > adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and > historical epidemiology. “Culturomics” extends the boundaries of > rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena > spanning the social sciences and the humanities.

You can get much of the data at the [Culturnomics website](http://www.culturomics.org/). And, you can explore some of the data via a [Google browser](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/). Below are some comparisons/trends I found interesting:
