Technology & genetics in the 21st century

I assume there will be more stories like this in the next year, [Gene Machine](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0117/features-jonathan-rothberg-medicine-tech-gene-machine_print.html):

> The machine that could change your life is a compact device, only 24 > inches wide, 20 inches deep and 21 inches high. At a glance you might > mistake it for a Playskool toy–or, better yet, the Apple II computer, > which sparked a revolution. Indeed, this gizmo, developed in a drab > office park overlooking a duck pond in Guilford, Conn., could have as > dramatic an impact as any technology since the personal computer and > help kick off a market that one day could be worth perhaps as much as > \$100 billion. >

Below that > is a row of four test tubes, marked with a circle, an X, a square and > a plus sign. These symbols represent the four basic chemical letters, > or bases, the body uses to form DNA–guanine, cytosine, adenine and > thymine. >
> Audaciously named the Personal Genome Machine (PGM), the silicon-based > device is the smallest and cheapest DNA decoder ever to hit the > market.

This seems a case where the technological innovation has raced ahead of the science which could leverage the new possibilities. Then again, it might also be a chicken & egg issue. If firms such as [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) get enough customers they might be able to drive the research themselves and therefore create their own demand.
