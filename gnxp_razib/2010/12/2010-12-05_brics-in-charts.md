BRICs in charts

The term “BRICs” gets thrown around a lot these days. At least it gets thrown around by people who perceive themselves to be savvy and worldly. In case you aren’t savvy and worldly, [BRICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC) just means Brazil, Russia, India and China. The huge rising economies of the past generation, and next generation. Here’s a summary from Wikipedia:

> The BRIC thesis recognizes that Brazil, Russia, India and China…have > changed their political systems to embrace global capitalism. Goldman > Sachs predicts that China and India, respectively, will become the > dominant global suppliers of manufactured goods and services, while > Brazil and Russia will become similarly dominant as suppliers of raw > materials. It should be noted that of the four countries, Brazil > remains the only nation that has the capacity to continue all > elements, meaning manufacturing, services, and resource supplying > simultaneously. Cooperation is thus hypothesized to be a logical next > step among the BRICs because Brazil and Russia together form the > logical commodity suppliers to India and China. Thus, the BRICs have > the potential to form a powerful economic bloc to the exclusion of the > modern-day states currently of “Group of Eight” status. Brazil is > dominant in soy and iron ore while Russia has enormous supplies of oil > and natural gas. Goldman Sachs’ thesis thus documents how commodities, > work, technology, and companies have diffused outward from the United > States across the world.

But there are big quantitative differences between these nations as well. Below the fold are some charts which I think illustrate those differences.
