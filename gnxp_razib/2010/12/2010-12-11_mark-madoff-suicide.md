Mark Madoff suicide

Long time readers know that I’ve been fascinated with the whole Bernie Madoff saga over the past few years. It looks like one of Bernie’s sons, Mark, [committed suicide](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-12-11-madoff_N.htm?csp=hf) on the two year anniversary of his father’s arrest. If you haven’t, I strongly suggest you read [this profile](http://nymag.com/news/crimelaw/66468/) of the elder Madoff’s time in prison:

> Madoff was accustomed to hearing other inmates call his name. From > July 14, the day he arrived, he’d been an object of fascination. > Prisoners had assiduously followed his criminal career on the prison > TVs. “Hey, Bernie,” an inmate would yell to him admiringly while he > was at his job sweeping up the cafeteria, “I seen you on TV.” In > return, Madoff nodded and waved, smiling that sphinxlike half-smile. > “What did he say?” Madoff sometimes asked. >
> But that evening an inmate badgered Madoff about the victims of his > \$65 billion scheme, and kept at it. According to K. C. White, a bank > robber and prison artist who escorted a sick friend that evening, > Madoff stopped smiling and got angry. **“Fuck my victims,” he said, > loud enough for other inmates to hear. “I carried them for twenty > years, and now I’m doing 150 years.”**

I don’t think we have to worry about Bernie ending his life by his own hands.
