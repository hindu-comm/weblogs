Everyone who is literate knows that the Sahara desert is the largest of its kind in the world. The chasm in cultural, biological, and physical geography is very noticeable. Northern Africa is part of the [Palearctic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palearctic_ecozone), while the peoples north of the Sahara have long been part of the circum-Mediterranean population continuum. The primary continuous habitable corridor is that of the Nile valley. And yet scholars [have long known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Subpluvial) that there has been variation in the climatic regime of the Sahara. The pharaohs of ancient Egypt seem to have hunted a wider range of fauna than is to be found in the deserts surrounding the current Nile valley, perhaps relics from a more humid period. Rock art in some regions of the desert indicate aquatic life, and species more characteristic of the savanna. And yet we should not think of the Sahara as a recent phenomenon; it does seem to be geologically ancient, despite periodic humid interregnums.

The ultimate aim seems to be to better frame the geographic constraints on the expansion of humanity from its African homeland, and refute a simple projection from the present to the past. In this case, it is the existence of the Nile as a verdant and habitable watercourse which connects the north and south, and bisects the continuous desert. [Ancient watercourses and biogeography of the Sahara explain the peopling of the desert](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/23/1012231108.abstract):

This paper was written before the [Denisovan admixture results](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-paradigm-is-dead-long-live-the-paradigm/) shifted the necessity to genuflect so explicitly to Out of Africa. But its results are interesting nonetheless, since they don’t depend too deeply on a paleoanthropological model. Rather, by surveying biogeogeography and geologic data they produce a sense of how the Sahara exhibited climatic flux over the past 100,000 years as a function of time and space. The latter is important because the Sahara is not an amorphous sandy waste. Rather, it exhibits a great deal of topographical variation:

In the [Tibesti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibesti) mountains the highest peaks are \~11,000 feet above sea level (3,400 meters). Because of the aridity of the Sahara in general even these elevations does not induce sufficient precipitation to produce a “green mountain” effect, common in other arid parts of northern Africa and Arabia. But in a regime of slightly only higher precipitation and milder temperatures (remove 3 degrees fahrenheit per 1,000 feet against latitude controlled sea level temperature)one can imagine the Tibesti having been much more biologically productive in the past. Consider this from the [Tassili n’Ajjer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassili_n'Ajjer) region of southern Algeria:

The main thrust of the paper seems to be to refute the common assumption that an eternal Nile served as the north-south corridor for African fauna, including humans. Here is the reason:

> Reanalysis of the Saharan zoogeography…suggests that many animals, > including water-dependent creatures such as fish and amphibians, > dispersed across the Sahara recently. For example, **25 North African > animal species have a spatial distribution with population centers > both north and south of the Sahara and small relict populations in > central regions.** This distribution suggests a trans-Saharan > dispersal in the past, with subsequent local isolation of central > Saharan populations during the more recent arid phase. If a diverse > range of species (including fish) can cross the Sahara, it is > impossible to envisage the Sahara functioning as barrier to hominin > dispersal. The zoogeography of the Nile suggests that it was a much > less effective corridor…**Only nine animal species that occupy the > Nile corridor today are also found both north and south of the > Sahara**….

There are also isolated pieces of evidence which refute a Nile-only model: **Saharan oases which have endemic species of crocodiles.** The existence of “desert crocodile” populations is a signal of a more well-watered past, with a subsequent retreat into isolated oases (some of these populations did go extinct in the 20th century though). In some ways this is a problem. Simple models make simple predictions, and are easier to test. But if simple models are false, that is an even greater problem.

Here are the figures which outline the primary results from geology and biogeography:

\[nggallery id=27\]

There are two primary inferences made in regards to humans:

1\) The Holocene inference seems to be that Nilo-Saharan populations have their origins in the societies which expanded north and south along the liminal zone of the Sahara. The authors argue that Nilo-Saharan populations on isolated oases in the northern Sahara are relics from the past expansion in the early Holocene. This sounds plausible, but it would be nice to explore this in more depth via linguistic and genetic analysis. With the rise of the camel and Islam a trans-Saharan trade in humans may have resulted in a great deal of trans-location of whole populations from one area to another. Concurrent with the Nilo-Saharans who pushed north the authors also suggest that savanna hunters moved south. I am not clear who these people are from the paper, and the mapping between archaeology and linguistics here seems more tentative.

2\) A deep history inference also seems to be that trans-Sahara population movements were feasible in a period around 120-100 years BP, but *not* 50-60 years BP. The distinction here matters because the latter is a relatively young age for the Out of Africa migration, while the former is an older one. If the latter view is correct then the only plausible route of migration is probably the coastal fringe of the Horn of Africa. If the former view is correct then a whole host of possibilities confront us, because the hydrography of the Sahara may have been constrained, but there were several avenues of migration.

In regards to \#2, a clement phase, and then resealing of the genetic barrier, may align well with [recent models](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/we-were-all-africans-before-the-intermission/) which posit a non-trivial period of separation between Africans and non-Africans *after* the Out of Africa migration. In other words early modern humans may have followed the pattern of many species, with an expansion into, and beyond, the Sahara, and then a subsequent separation of two populations by a resurgent desert. The difference is that the daughter population isolated on the far side of the desert eventually “broke out” from the margins of the African homeland to the rest of the world.
