On that Native American ancestor

[Traces of Sub-Saharan African and Amerindian admixture in old stock European Americans](https://bga101.blogspot.com/2010/12/traces-of-sub-saharan-african-and.html):

I discount the role of the Roman Empire. Rather, I think the key point is to focus on the *maritime* nature of Britain’s possessions, and the historically attested presence of numerous sailors from Africa and Asia in port cities in the 18th century. A good test of this would be the Netherlands, which like the United Kingdom had a far flung maritime colonial presence ([Portuguese](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UOHFTxL-bOA/TOYpHMIrsVI/AAAAAAAAAOE/on63ho681uI/s1600/ADMIXTURE10.jpeg) have a significant minor African ancestral contribution, but this is a somewhat different case because Portugal had African slaves in the metropole in the early modern period).

How about Native Americans? Harder for obvious reasons:

It seems likely that it is going to be harder to make definitive assessments about *individuals*, but, one can be confident that there are trace but non-trivial elements of African and Native American ancestry among “Old Americans.” That is, those whose ancestors arrived in the USA before the Revolutionary War, and so have roots in this continent when Native Americans (and Africans as well) were a substantially higher proportion of the human population.

It’s pretty awesome that all this is being done by a self-described amateur. With the emergence of [Genomes Unzipped](http://genomesunzipped.com/), [Dodecad](//dodecad.blogspot.com), and [BGA](https://bga101.blogspot.com/) we’re in a new era (and thanks to all the researchers who contribute software like [ADMIXTURE](http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/) to the public tool base).

As thanks for the all hard work and transparency of method of the principal behind [BGA](https://bga101.blogspot.com/) I’ve dropped a tip into his [PayPal account](https://www.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=aRCmyKbOVFMR8z7nSVyUYmFgP7yf7w0_g9yT4OfXRJ9AEZlavcP90hhdepm&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d9384d85353843a619606282818e091d0). I know this sort of analysis requires some serious investment of time, but I suspect that these early projects will have a positive spillover effect, showing the intelligent and curious public what can be done with a little perseverance and effort.
