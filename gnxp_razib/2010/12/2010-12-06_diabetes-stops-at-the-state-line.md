Diabetes stops at the state line!

Visualization of data is great. And sometimes it tells us something…though we don’t always know what. [Slate](http://labs.slate.com/articles/diabetes-in-america/) has an interactive feature showing the rise of [diabetes in America](http://labs.slate.com/articles/diabetes-in-america/) by county. Nothing too surprising.

![stateline](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/stateline.png?resize=600%2C341)![stateline](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/stateline.png?resize=600%2C341)

But follow the gradient from El Paso to the Illinois-Missouri border. The differences are small across state lines, **but the consistent differences along the borders really don’t make.** Are there state-level policies or regulations causing this? Or, are there state-level differences in measurement? This weird pattern shows up in other CDC data I’ve seen.

**Update:** I think the mystery is solved in the [comments](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/diabetes-stops-at-the-state-line/#comment-53843):
