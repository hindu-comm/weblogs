"Genome blogging"

*Nature* [profiles](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101215/full/468880a.html) [Dodecad](dodecad.blogspot.com),the [Pickrell Affair](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/11/am-i-partly-jewish-an-unexpected-turn-of-events.php), and the emergence of amateur genomicists in a [new piece](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101215/full/468880a.html). Interestingly David of [BGA](https://bga101.blogspot.com/) is going to try and get something through peer review. In particular, the relationship of Assyrians and Jews.

So we have [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/), [Dodecad](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/), and [BGA](https://bga101.blogspot.com/). What next? Who next? I hope Dienekes doesn’t mind if I divulge the fact that the computational resources needed to utilize ADMIXTURE as he has is within the theoretical capability of *everyone* reading this post. Rather, the key is getting familiar with [PLINK](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and writing some code to merge data sets. After you do that, to really add value you’d probably want to get raw data from more than what you can find in the HGDP, HapMap and other public resources.

But here I make an open offer: if you start a blog or a project which replicates the methods of [Dodecad](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/) and [BGA](https://bga101.blogspot.com/) I’ll link to you and promote you. When Dienekes began [Dodecad](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/) I actually started to play around with the data sets in ADMIXTURE, but I’ve personally held off until seeing what he and David find. What their pitfalls and successes might be. Here’s to 2011 being more interesting than we can imagine!

**Update:** Already had a friend with a computational background contact me about doing something on South Asian genomics. So again: **if you get a site/blog set up, and start pumping out plots, I will promote you.** In particular, if you need 23andMe raw data files of geographical region X it might be useful to try and get the word out via blogs and what not.
