Notes & links – December 9th, 2010

[Of arsenic and aliens: What the critics said](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/12/08/of-arsenic-and-aliens-what-the-critics-said/). Carl Zimmer’s correspondence dump is gold.

[Linear Population Model: Explores a linear model to examine genetic population admixture results and human prehistory](https://linearpopulationmodel.blogspot.com/). I read *every* post on this weblog after I stumbled upon it yesterday. The major focus seems to be to use ADMIXTURE results along with formal diffusion models to construct a plausible scenario of the spread of Neolithic populations from Southwest Asia to Europe. I think the author probably needs to be a bit careful about the noise in the data, but still very interesting. Anticipated some of my own thoughts which I was too cowardly to post online!

You may not know it from the links on the front page, but *Wired* does have some awesome [science blogs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs). I often mention the *enfant terrible* of the cognitive neuroscience blogosphere, [Jonah R. Lehrer](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/frontal-cortex), but be sure to check out [Laelaps](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/laelaps) & [Neuron Culture](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/neuronculture).

Now reading [War in Human Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199236631/geneexpressio-20/). Quite the page turner. Thanks for the recommendation.

[Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025//geneexpressio-20). A useful book. I wish more people were familiar with it.

[WikiLeaks cables: Saudi princes throw parties boasting drink, drugs and sex](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-cables-saudi-princes-parties). The West may be decadent, but it is not hypocritical in this fashion. King Saud of Saudi Arabia was an [alcoholic](https://books.google.com/books?id=h9FZaNi5ToYC&lpg=PA122&dq=Saud%20%20Abdul%20Aziz%20alcoholic&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false).

[Denim & Tweed](http://www.denimandtweed.com/). Another excellent weblog.
