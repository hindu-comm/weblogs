Daily Data Dump – Wednesday

[Epigenome effort makes its mark](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101006/full/467646a.html?s=news_rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+news/rss/most_recent+(NatureNews+-+Most+recent+articles)). “This week, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, a US\$170-million effort to identify and map those marks — known collectively as the human epigenome — begins its first comprehensive data release.”

[At Flagging Tribune, Tales of a Bankrupt Culture](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/media/06tribune.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print). The story of executives taking home millions while the ship goes down is very old-school. Mao ate well while millions starved and China as a nation-state was being economically eviscerated. The scale of the moral calamity differed by orders of magnitude, but I think the principal-agent problem is basically the same.

  
[Science Knows Best](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Appiah-t.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all&pagewanted=all). ‘The most compelling strand in “The Moral Landscape” is its unspooling diatribe against relativism.’ I am not a “New Atheist,” and find some of Sam Harris’ assertions about religion as a natural phenomenon embarrassingly unsubtle. I also have much more sympathy for David Hume’s is/ought distinction and assumption that reason is generally the “slave of the passions.” *But*, I also have sympathy for Sam Harris’ almost guileless positivism and Western chauvinism. I may deny on some deep level that Ed Witten engages in an enterprise which is more morally edifying than that of a witch-doctor, but for practical purposes I encourage the flourishing of shamans who ply in String Theory as opposed to those who drink their own urine. I differ with Sam Harris as to how reality works, but I am definitely one of his tribe, and even I as *a*tribal as I am in disposition feel its pull when Harris inveighs against the witch-doctors.

[483 – The Great European Shouting Match](http://bigthink.com/ideas/24357?utm_source=feedburner). All the maps of Europe as seen by various European countries. Very funny that Germany is viewed as “dirty porn” by several other nations. How’d that come to be?

[How not to fight colds: is it really that clear cut?](http://blogs.plos.org/bodypolitic/2010/10/06/how-not-to-fight-colds-is-it-really-that-clear-cut/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plos/blogs/bodypolitic+(Blogs+-+Body+Politic)). An interesting rebuttal to some of the advice that Jennifer Ackerman has been offering while promoting her new book [Ah-Choo!: The Uncommon Life of Your Common Cold](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/044654115X/geneexpressio-20).
