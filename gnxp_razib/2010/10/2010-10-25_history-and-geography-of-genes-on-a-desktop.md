History and Geography of Genes on a Desktop

In case you donâ€™t know, [Dienekes Pontikos](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/search/label/ADMIXTURE-experiments) has been posting a lot of analyses of [available](http://hagsc.org/hgdp/files.html) [population genetic](http://jorde-lab.genetics.utah.edu/?page_id=23) [data sets](http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with the [ADMIXTURE](http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/) program. You can find his myriad posts under the [ADMIXTURE-experiments](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/search/label/ADMIXTURE-experiments) tag. Below is a bar plot he generated today.
