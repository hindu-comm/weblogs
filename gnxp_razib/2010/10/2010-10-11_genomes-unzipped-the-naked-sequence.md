Genomes Unzipped – the naked sequence

[Looks like Dr. Daniel MacArthur & company went and did it](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/our-genomes-unzipped.php), go get their [genotypes](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/data), or [browse them online](https://github.com/genomesunzipped/genomesunzipped). This should be interesting. Since Dr. MacArthur’s wife has agreed to be a participant in some ways [Tobias MacArthur](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/09/my_genetic_future_part_2_resul.php) is also part of the project by implication. To some extent the same is true of the current or future children of all the [participants](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/members). And you can work your way up and across the family trees as well. I’m 99.9% sure that this won’t really matter. I believe that by the time Tobias MacArthur is self-aware people won’t be so paranoid about genetic privacy. On the other hand I too have a raw 23andMe data file, and I haven’t posted it online, and I won’t just quite yet. This is a case where I’ll let others get on the elevator first to test it out.
