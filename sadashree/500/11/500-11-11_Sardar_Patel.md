> *“The problem of states is so difficult, you alone can solve it”.*
>
> *— Mahatma Gandhi*

When one thinks of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, there is just so much to the man, that it is well impossible to explore his life in one singe article. But if I had to choose one part of his life, it would be the way he integrated, 500 odd princely states, into one nation. Imagine having to deal with multiple mini states, each having their own set of issues, and welding them into one single nation.

Add to it, a newly independent India, dealing with the trauma of Partition, the Pakistan attack on Kashmir, and the Nizam of Hyderabad trying to create his own independent state. It would surely need a man of iron will to surmount these challenges, and it had to be Sardar Patel.

When India became independent in 1947, there were two distinct entities, one that was directly under the British, and other the Princely states, under the British crown. Apart from these there were the colonial enclaves of French( Pondicherry) and the Portuguese( Goa, Daman, Diu).

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3884f730-fbd5-4354-a239-0488fa3b4fc1_602x491.jpeg)

This how the map of India looked like during the British era, so one can just imagine the magnitude of the challenge, confronting Sardar Patel. And with differing positions on accession, a “one size fits all” strategy would have been counter productive. The concerns of the Princely states, would have to be taken into account, and balanced with the need for Accession. What Sardar Patel, did was use the traditional *saam, daan, bhed, dand* tactics, of negotiating with the states, addressing their concerns, and using force only as a last resort.

The major issue he had to deal with was that of the Princely states, each of which had their own concerns and apprehensions to be dealt with. Bhopal, Hyderabad, Travancore, did not want to go along with India or Pakistan, and sought independent status. Both Hyderabad and Travancore reached out to Western nations for support, while Bhopal began to work upon an alliance with other princely states and the Muslim league in it’s favor.

However the lack of unity among the princely states, meant the resistance fell flat. Add to it, most of the smaller princely states, were apprehensive of being dominated by the larger states. And there was no love lost between the Hindu and Muslim rulers. Another factor, that helped Patel’s cause was the Muslim League’s decision to stay out of the Constituent Assembly, that meant Bhopal’s plan did not work out. Also in most of the princely states, the ordinary people favored integration with India. The ruler of Travancore, abandoned plans for independence, after his subjects favored integration with India.

The three persons who played a key role in the integration were Patel himself, Mountbatten and Patel’s Man Friday V.P.Menon. Mountbatten being on friendly first terms with most princes, categorically told them, that Britian would neither grant them any dominion status nor admit them into the Commonwealth. He also emphasized that integrating with India was better for the states economic interest, and also they did not have the resources to combat a likely Leftist insurgency.

Patel and Menon came up with a policy to please the princely states, more conciliatory and seeking to negotiate, than force them. Patel promised a more federal structure, where the States would be treated as equals than subordinates under the Union. Two key documents, were presented by him, to the Princely states. One was the Standstill Agreement, which promised status quo and not doing away with existing practices of states.

The other was Instrument of Accession by which the ruler agreed to accession to India, while having control over subject matters. It again varied from state to state. Only defense, external affairs, and communications were completely with the Centre, the rest were negotiable with the States. It guaranteed the States, a complete degree of autonomy over subjects they had jurisdiction over. Nor would the states lose their right to receive British honors or decorations.

There were issues with border states like Jodhpur, whose ruler Hanwant Singh, was dead against Congress. Along with Jaisalmer, he began to negotiate with Jinnah, who saw this as a god given opportunity to gain control of strategic border areas. However the overwhelming support among the subjects of these two states, made the rulers change their minds, and both acceeded to India.

Junagadh’s ruler wanted to accede to Pakistan, however the neighbouring princely states, vehemently opposed this idea, and tension was building up in Gujarat. Patel pointed out that Junagadh being 80% Hindu should be part of India, and called for a plebiscite. Simultaneously all food supplies, communications, to Junagadh were cut off, forces were sent to it’s border. With it’s Nawab and his family fleeing to Pakistan, by 1948, the Indian Government took over.

Now came the task of completing the integration process, again each state had it’s own legislature and administrative set up, that Patel had to consider. The first step was to merge the smaller princely states, with other larger states to create a union.

December 1947- Princely states in Odisha, Bihar, Central India signed merger agreements, forming part of those states by January 1, 1948.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

948- 66 smaller states in Kathiawar, and some in the Deccan, were merged with Bombay Presidency. These included Kolhapur, Baroda to create Bombay state, that would later split into Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Other states were merged with Assam, United Provinces( now UP), Madras, East Punjab and West Bengal. 30 states of the erstwhile Punjab Hill States Agency were integrated into Himachal Pradesh, that was directly under the control of the Center. Himachal being a sensitive border state, it was felt necessary to be under Central control.

Some of the larger princely states like Kutch, Bhopal, Tripura, Manipur, were directly bought under Central control.

All the smaller princely states in Kathiawar were merged with Saurashtra. Madhya Bharat emerged in 1948, which consisted of Gwalior, Indore and smaller princely states. PEPSU( Patiala and East Punjab States Union) was formed by July 15, 1948 with merging of Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Faridkot.

By May 1949, most of the Rajput princely states, were integrated into the United State of Rajasthan. By mid 1949, Travancore and Cochin merged to form Travancore-Cochin, that would later be Kerala. Madras Presidency was divided and neighboring princely states, were merged to form Karnataka( erstwhile Mysore State), Kerala( Travancore-Cochin), Andhra Pradesh( Ceded districts and Coastal area).

And of course there was Operation Polo to integrated Hyderabad, that would be a separate article by itself, you can check that out [here](https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/operation-polo/).

**Governance**

Sardar Patel also played a key role in drafting the Constitution of India, and backed the appointment of Dr.Ambedkar as Chairman. TheKaira District Milk Producers Cooperative was formed with Sardar Patel’s guidance, and it would be a predecessor to Amul.Gandhi’s assasination upset Sardar Patel, who felt guilty that as Home Minister he could not prevent it, and offered to resign.Nehru, Rajaji and others defended Patel, in public, over the criticism to prevent Gandhi’s assassination.Nehru again wanted Rajaji to be first President, but Sardar’s backing for Babu Rajendra Prasad, helped in his election.

The same with P.D.Tandon, whom Nehru did not want as Congress President in 1950, but was backed again by Sardar Patel. Hewas also instrumental in creating the IAS and IPS, has also been regarded as father of Indian civil services. He backed the bureaucrats fully, gave them a free hand, listened to them, the reason why they respected him so much.When Sardar Patel passed away in 1950, 1500 civil servants attended his funeral, to pledge complete loyalty to service of nation. Today he is no longer with us, but his legacy remains in the form of a united India.
