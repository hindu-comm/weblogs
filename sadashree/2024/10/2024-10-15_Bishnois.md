The Bishnois are basically a Vaishnava Panth found primarily in Western Rajasthan, and parts of Haryana.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F708035bf-9d12-4a1a-8f43-b7dc12699f30_220x304.jpeg)

</div>

The Panth was believed to have been founded by Guru Jambeshwar, who was born in a Rajput family, hailing from a small village in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. He was basically a cow herder, and at the age of 34 founded the Bishnoi sect at Samrathal Dhora. For the rest of his life, he would preach the values he laid down for the community in the form of Shabadwani. This is the reason why Bishnois are also called Jambeshwarpanthis.

The backdrop to the founding of the sect was the massive drought in 1485, that devastated large parts of Rajasthan. He laid down 29 Niyamas or rules, which in a way also explains the sect’s name Bis(20) and Noi(9), that prohibit killing of animals and cutting down sacred trees. The Khejri tree is considered sacred by them.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9035d2b-9813-4ae1-9049-7710dcebf465_220x293.jpeg)

</div>

One thing to note is that Bishnoi does not indicate any particular community, there are Jats, Brahmins, Rajputs, Banias and Charans who are part of the sect. While Bishnois are often considered as one of the Jat clans, in reality it’s more a sect, that encompasses different communities.

The Bishnois in a sense were one of the early eco warriors in India, protecting trees, animals. Of the 29 Niyamas prescibed, 8 of them deal with protecting bio diversity, that include a ban on killing of animals, cutting down green trees. They are also instructed to see that the firewood they use is devoid of small insects. Blue color is prohibited, as the dye is made from indigo.

One incident that has influenced their value system has been the Khejarli massacre that occured in September 1730, when 363 Bishnois laid down their life trying to protect a grove of Khejri trees at a village called Jehnad. Apparently Maharaja Abhai Singh of Jodhpur, had sent his minister Giridhar Bhandari, to cut down the Khejri trees near the village, as he needed wood for the construction of a new palace.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe331d235-9c94-44c9-8ed8-e35f09afcaa1_220x325.jpeg)

</div>

However the villagers led by Amrita Devi Bishnoi, refused to allow the soldiers to cut the trees, stating they were sacred to them. When the soldiers demanded a bribe to leave the trees alone, Amrita Devi refused and along with her daughters began to hug the trees. The soldiers killed Amrita Devi and her two daughters, and soon the news spread to surrounding Bishnoi villages. The village councils convened a meeting, and directed that each village would have at least one volunteer to protect the trees.

Giridhar Bhandari ordered the Bishnois hugging the trees to be killed, but it only intensified the resistance, as they laid down their lives for what they believed one. Around 363 Bishnois were killed, in protecting the trees, that included elders, women, children. Abhai Singh, shocked by the massacre, recalled his men, and personally travelled to the village to apologize.

The village was later renamed as Khejarli, and it’s now a place of pilgrimage for the Bishnois. There is a memorial there commemorating this event, that would be the inspiration for other such events like Chipko in Uttarakhand. Also every year on Bhadrapad Shukla Dashami, the Bishnois assemble there to commemorate the sacrifice.

Of the other 29 Niyamas of the Bishnois, 10 are on personal hygiene and good health, seven for healthy social behavior and four for the worship of God. The ideal life is defined as following Kshama(patience), modesty, Santosha( Happiness) and Shaucha( cleanliness).

Puja is to be performed twice, and a Vishnu Aarti is to be given in the evening, while Havan is done to distance lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego from oneself,and fast has to be held on Amavasya.

Animals have to be sheltered and taken care of, while bulls are not to be sterilized. The niyamas forbid the usage of Bhang, tobacco, alcohol, trading in Opium, eating of meat and lead a moral life.

The sacred sites of the Bishnois are known as Sathri or Dham, located in places that have some connection with Guru Jambeshwar, while there are open air shrines located in fields or under trees called Than. They have 8 major shrines called Ashtadham.

Peepasar Dham in Nagaur dt, the birthplace of Guru Jambeshwar, also called as avatar sthal. The childhood home of Jambhoji is called Thakur Lohatji, and Janmasthami is also celebrated here grandly.

Samrathal Dhora located nearby, is where Jambhoji delivered most of his sermons, and also where the Bishnoi sect originated.

Lohawat in Jodhpur district, is where Jambhoji is believed to have given darshan to Jodhpur prince Maldev, while the Bishnoi temple at Janglu( Bikaner dt) has a collection of Guruji’s personal belongings, and also a fire altar where havan was performed.

Rotu in Nagaur district, has a huge shrine dedicated to Jambhoji, while Jamba Dham is where he is believed to have got a holy pond dug, known as Jamba Talaw, an annual fair on Chaitra Amavasya is held here. And Lalasar is where Jambhoji was believed to have breathed his last, following which his body was taken to Mukam.

The Bishnoi legacy lives on in other ways too, the Science and Technology university in Hissar, Haryana is named after Guru Jambeshwar, while the National award given by the Central Govt for wildlife conservation is named after Amrita Devi Bishnoi.
