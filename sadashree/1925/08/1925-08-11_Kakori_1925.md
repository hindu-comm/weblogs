Kakori is a small town located near Lucknow, famous for it’s kebabs, Dasheri mangoes and Zardozi work. It is also the seat of the Qadiriya Qalandari Sufi order, and since the 15th century, one of the main abodes of the Alavi, Abbasi branches of the Kakorvi Shaikh community. Like most of the towns in Avadh, it has large palatial homes of landed Muslim gentry. Many famous Muslim writers like Mohsin Kakorvi, his son Noorul Hasan Nayyier who compiled Nurul Lughaat, a well known Urdu dictionary and satirist Ghulam Ahmed Alavi hail from here.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

The town would however be more well known for an incident that happened here on August 9, 1925, the Kakori Conspiracy or the Kakori Train Robbery an important chapter in the revolutionary struggle. It wasn’t just an act of rebellion — it was a symbolic rupture in colonial authority. What’s compelling is how this singular event allowed an otherwise modest town to inscribe itself permanently in India’s freedom narrative. The meticulous planning, the ideological courage — it’s the kind of historical drama begging for more retelling.

The mastermind was Ram Prasad Bismil, one of the greatest revolutionaries ever who had co founded the Hindustan Republican Association along with Sachindranath Sanyal and Jadugopal Mukherjee. Bismil already had a well running business in Shahjahanpur which he had left to organize the revolutionary movement. However the lack of funds was proving to be a main hindrance.

While he led some dacoities initially to gather money, Ram Prasad realized it was not sufficient, and there was no point in harassing his own fellow Indians. It was at such a time, while he was travelling from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow, by train, he observed that at each station, the Station Master bought bags of money and placed them in the guard’s carriage, there was no one to guard them.

The 8 Down between Shahjahanpur and Lucknow used to pass through Kakori daily, and that was the genesis of the conspiracy. The intention was to stop the train at Kakori, loot the money bags, which would be used to fund the revolution.

And soon a team was assembled with Bismil leading it,and his close friend Ashfaqullah Khan, the next in charge. Both of them were from the same town Shahjahanpur, then a leading revolutionary hub, and Ashfaq was an admirer of Bismil’s poetry from long.

They had joined the Congress in 1921 along with another freedom fighter Prem Kishen Khanna. When the HRA was founded, he was Deputy to Ram Prasad Bismil, and together both expanded the revolutionary activity in the Northern plains.

Ashfaqullah had initially opposed the plan, saying it was too risky, and the Government would crack down real hard. His initial resistance highlights the moral weight of the plan — not just for him, but for a generation navigating the tightrope between idealism and survival. That he eventually lent support shows how conviction sometimes overrides caution when history calls.

However with others like Rajendra Lahiri, Thakur Roshan Singh going along with Bismil, he too lent his support. And that was one powerful ensemble, the fiery audacity of Chandrashekhar Azad, the quiet resolve of Rajendra Lahiri and Roshan Singh ,while Bismil and Ashfaq made up the emotional and ideological backbone. Each name carries a legacy etched in defiance and vision.

And above all Manmath Nath Gupta, whose book They Lived Dangerously, would give an excellent perspective of the revolutionary struggle for freedom. His insider view transforms the Kakori episode from historical record to lived memory. His reflections add depth, humanity, and context to these fighters beyond their stoic public personas.

August 9, 1925

It was around evening time, the revolutionaries had already boarded the train. Rajendra Lahiri pulled the chain at Kakori station, while Ashfaqullah held the driver hostage with his Mauser pistol . While Ram Prasad Bismil pushed the guard down and looted the Government money from his cabin. However when none could break the safe, it was Ashfaq once again who managed to break it with all his strength.

There was no bloodshed, except for one passenger killed accidentally. Soon the Government cracked down, on the Kakori conspirators and, and arrest warrants were issued. While Azad managed to evade the crackdown, Ram Prasad was arrested soon enough at Saharanpur, while Ashfaqullah went into hiding for some time.

Ashfaq spent some time in Kanpur, working in Ganesh Vidyarthi’s printing press. And for quite some time he wandered all over the North from Kanpur to Bihar to Rajasthan, changing names. He finally went to Delhi, and wanted to somehow escape India and meet Lala Hardayal. However he was betrayed by his own friend in Delhi, to the police and was arrested by Ikramul Haque.

The British response was swift, unforgiving, and expansive. Arresting forty individuals wasn’t just tactical — it was meant to psychologically break the movement. Yet in doing so, they also revealed its scope: a resistance not confined to town or caste, but stretching from Shahjahanpur to Bengal, Pratapgarh to the pulse of Pan-Indian awakening.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

The lion hearts of Shahjahanpur, Ashfaqullah, Bismil, Roshan Singh, the emotional and strategic core.

Sachindranath Sanyal, from Bengal, the philosopher of resistance, HRA’s constitutional mind.

Sachindranath Bakshi, from Pratapgarh,  soft-spoken yet staunch.

Each arrest wasn’t just a blow; it was a revelation of the depth, diversity, and intellect driving the rebellion. Of these 15 were released due to lack of evidence, while Banwari Lal and Indu Bhushan Mitra turned approvers for a more leninent sentence.

May 21, 1926

The trial began against the remaining in the special sessions court of A. Hamilton. The appointment of Jagat Narayan wasn’t incidental — it was tactical. Bringing in a prosecutor with a known vendetta against Bismil injected bias into a process already skewed by colonial power. His prior role in the Mainpuri Conspiracy made the trial feel less like justice and more like revenge cloaked in legalese.

The police leaned hard on him — promising clemency, threatening consequences. Yet Ashfaq chose loyalty over life. His refusal to testify wasn’t just brave; it was monumental. In a system built to fracture unity, he upheld it, refusing to betray those who had become more than comrades — fellow dreamers in a vision for free India.

Gobind Ballabh Pant, Mohan Lal Saxena, and Chandra Bhanu Gupta weren’t just lawyers — they were patriots in robes. Their presence gave the courtroom dignity, transforming a legal defense into a statement of solidarity. They represented not just individuals, but ideals.

Having names like Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malviya, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi speak up sent shockwaves. It meant that the revolutionaries weren’t fringe outlaws — they were sons of the soil fighting with conscience. The revolution had stepped out of the shadows and into the embrace of mainstream nationalism.

And finally the verdict was pronounced.

The death sentences for Bismil, Ashfaq, Lahiri, and Roshan Singh felt less like punishment and more like a colonial effort to erase courage from memory. But instead, those gallows became sanctuaries of sacrifice.

Cellular Jail awaited Sanyal and Bakshi — a place where freedom fighters were buried alive in silence. Yet from its depths emerged *Bandi Jeevan*, an immortal chronicle, pulsing with pain and resilience.

Manmath Nath Gupta, with his 14-year sentence, became both prisoner and historian, shaping how future generations would remember the revolutionaries not as martyrs alone, but as thinkers, poets, friends.

This wasn’t merely a verdict. It was a reckoning. The British may have hoped to extinguish a fire — but they ended up kindling a thousand more. Each sentence handed down only deepened the ink of history, enriching the soil from which later freedom movements would bloom.

The petitions — from Madan Mohan Malviya’s earnest appeal backed by 78 signatures, to S.L. Polak’s direct plea to the King — reflect how deeply these revolutionaries stirred hearts across political and geographical divides.

Yet every rejection didn’t just seal a fate — it echoed the stubborn cruelty of colonial indifference. The cries for mercy weren’t just for four men — they were for the ideals they embodied.

Rajendra Lahiri, hanged prematurely at Gonda, perhaps to diffuse protest by staggering the sentences.

Ashfaqullah Khan at Faizabad, his execution, like his life, marked by dignity and quiet intensity.

Ram Prasad Bismil at Gorakhpur,a poet facing death with verses, not vengeance.

Thakur Roshan Singh at Nain, another spark extinguished with deliberate finality.

Their hangings did not deter the movement — it consecrated it.

The voices fell silent, but the spirit would continue to inspire countless other revolutionaries.

And it did so through Bhagat Singh’s fire, Chandrashekhar Azad’s resolve, and in every heartbeat that refused to bow before empire. Kakori wasn’t just a chapter — it was a torch handed down through time, a a rebellion reincarnated in verse, protest, and sacrifice. From student movements to wartime resistance, Kakori was the spark beneath every call to conscience.
