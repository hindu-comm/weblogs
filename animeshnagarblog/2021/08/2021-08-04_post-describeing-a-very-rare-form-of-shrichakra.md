A very rare form of shrIchakra



![ह्रीँ श्रीँ श्रीचक्रेश्वरीपादुकां पूजयामि
॥](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/img_20210804_1228482894998123942998425.jpg)

This kashmIrI / pahADi style painting depicts a very rare form of
shrIchakra . In contrast with the prevalent geometry of shrIchakra ,
this form of shrIchakrarAja have single bhupura and three valayas (
which is actual and correct interpretation of ‘vRRittatrayaM’ pada in
uddhArashloka of shrIchakra).

```

Both paramAnandatantra and vAmakeshvarImata describes this single
bhupura and tri-valaya geometry of shrIchakra. In earlier traditions of
traipurasaMpradAya this form of shrIchakra was worshiped . Deities in
trailokyamohanachakra were very different from the current one ,
worshiped according to later traditions of traipurasaMpradAya which rely
on later shrIkulatantras.  
rAjAnaka jayaratha in his gloss on vAmakeshvarImata also describes this
form of shrIchakra in following verse.

chakraM baindavamambikAmayam iyaM vAmA trayo ye bhramA jyeShTheyaM
yadidaMpurandarapure rekhAchatuShkaM bahiH ।  
yoayaM shaktyanalatrikoNanivaho raudrIyamityAmRRishan

Oh goddess ! baindavachakra is thy ambikA shakti form, three circles are
vAmA shakti form of thy , bhUpura with four lines is thy form of
jyeShThA shakti and triangles in shrIchakra represents thy raudrI shakti
form .The person who knows this and meditates on your fourfold form is
only your true worshiper.

Lost shrIrasamahodadhi , an earlier text of shrIkrama too supports
single bhupura in shrIchakra.

shrIbhAskararAya too was aware of this form of shrIchakra. In his
setubandhaTIkA he qoutes an verse of unknown origin describing this
form.

guNavRRittaM tataH kuryAchchaturasraM cha tadbahiH ॥

Regarding three circles of shrIchakra shrIbhAskararAya in his
setubandhaTIkA mentions” In tradition of other saMhitAs and tantras only
three circles are discribed not five. “

> saMhitAtantrAntarespaShTaM vRRittatritayamevopalabhyate na tat

Regarding bhupur he writes ” Bhupur is square with four gates drawn by
single line. As single line bhupur is described in vAmakeshvarImatam.”
