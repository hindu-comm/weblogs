A verse from karpUrama~njarI

karpUrama\~njarI is an experimental drama written in shaurasenI
prAkRRita around 900 CE by mahAkavi rAjashekhara . The early mediaeval
period of Indian history was time , when many tantric sects rose to
prominence . They were both subject of fear and reverence in Indian
society . Dramatists too were part of that society , so most of them
choose to potray a fearsome image of kApAlikas.This work is unique in
many sense. In contrast with Indian tradition of Sanskrit drama,it is
written in pure prAkRRita. Second important point to notice about this
drama is, it potrayes a positive image of kApAlika ascetic while other
dramatists of that time potrayed a negetive and fearsome image of
kApAlikas to there subjects. mAlatImAdhava ,harShacharitra
mattavilAsaprahasana and yashastilaka are examples of such dramas. In
pandemic time , while going through the karpUrama\~njarI , a prAkRRita
verse attracted my attention.This verse is invocation to goddess
chAmuNDA .

Sanskrit ChAyA of this sloka will be like

” Praise to godess chaNDikA who drinks alcohol of life from skull of
brahmA , in mahAkAlarudra’s palace of destruction. “

This verse praises fearsome form of mother divine chAmuNDA who is
drinking blood and alcohol from skull of brahmA during the final
distruction of Universe.Why This verse attracted my attention is because
this verse have multiple secrate meanings.This verse can be interpreted
in light of krama doctrine ,kula doctrine and Tantra doctrine. I’m not
interpretating whole verse but pointing out some words and hidden
aspects encapsulated in them .

**chaNDI** = kuNDalinI,chaNDakApAlini, chAmuNDA ,kAlasaNkarShiNI  
**kapAlachashaka=** Skull cup,kAdya, brahmarandhra, VirapAtra  
**kalpANtakelibhavan** = mahAshmashAna, Final yogic State of

**rudhirasurAm** = brahmarasa, nector falling from sahasrAra ,
