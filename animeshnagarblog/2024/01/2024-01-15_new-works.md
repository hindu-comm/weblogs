By the blessings of goddess Kālasañkarshinī and Guru Mandal, our kalīKrama Prachāriniī Sabhā has released two new works.  
  
1. amriteshwarārchan paddhati  
( अमृतेश्वरार्चनपद्धतिः )  
  
The book includes a sadhana vidhi for Amriteshwar Bhairava based on the Shāradā and Devanāgarī manuscripts of the 14th and 17th centuries. Amriteshwar Bhairava’s Shaiva rituals based on Netra Tantra and nandīshikhāvatāra are described in detail, including the very rare saptāvarana puja and nyāsas.  
  
  
2. brahma yāmalokta yoginī vijaya Stava  
(ब्रह्मयामलोक्त श्रीयोगिनीविजयस्तवः)  
  
A single manuscript was used to publish this rare stotra from Brahmayāmala.  
The main mandala of Kapālisha bhairava and various yoginis is described by it. Stotra praises several yogis and matrikas. In their respective pithas, there is also a description of the union of ashta matrikas and ashta bhairavas.A stotra that has 333 verses in detail and is associated with southern agmic currents ( Bhairavāgama or Bhairava Shrota)
