Ramblings on Tibetan Chöd System

-   Chöd (གཅོད/Chedaka) is a special vajrayAna Buddhist sAdhanA of
    anuttarayoga class tantra.

&nbsp;

-   Chöd literally mean ‘Cutting Through the Ego’.It cuts through
    hindrances and obscurations, sometimes called ‘demons’ or ‘gods’.It
    is also known as ‘The Beggars Offering’.

&nbsp;

-   Chöd has long been a way of seeking direct and personal experiences
    of mind and divinity outside of conventional and institutional
    frameworks of Vajrayana Buddhism.

&nbsp;

-   According to Machig Labdrön མ་གཅིག་ལབ་སྒྲོན the main goal of Chöd is
    cutting through ego clinging.

&nbsp;

-   Historically Maa Machig Labdrön མ་གཅིག་ལབ་སྒྲོན is originator of the
    Chöd lineage in Tibet.

&nbsp;

-   She is renowned 11th century Tibetan tantric Buddhist yoginI who is
    reincarnation of Yeshe Tsogyal ཡེ་ཤེས་མཚོ་རྒྱལ.

&nbsp;

-   Padampa Sanggye was guru of Machig Labdrön.Dampa Sangye is known as
    the ‘father of Chöd’.

&nbsp;

-   Machig’s encounters with and teachings received from Dampa Sangye, a
    famed Indian master, provided the basis for her development and
    formalization of the Chöd.

&nbsp;

-   One of her major contributions in Tibetan Buddhism is systemisation
    of the practice of Chöd .She is known as the ‘Mother of Chöd’.

&nbsp;

-   As one of Machig Labdron’s biographies states

> All the Dharmas originated in India And later spread to TibetOnly
> Machig’s teaching, born in Tibet Was later introduced in India and
> practiced there.

-   Iconographically, she is depicted holding a large drum, a vajrablad
    in her right hand and a bell in her left. Her right leg is often
    lifted and the standing left leg is bent in motion, in a dancing
    posture. Machig Labdron is depicted as white in color with three
    eyes and a pleasing countenance. She wears the Six Bone Ornaments of
    the charnel grounds, and stands on a lotus. Above Machig Labdron is
    Buddha Shakyamuni and mahasiddhas and the Chod lineage masters,
    while specific teachers and lineage holders are on either side.
    Below her is a tantric deity holding a Chod bone trumpet and
    swinging skins, while Gesar and a wrathful tantric dakini are on
    either side.

&nbsp;

-   Machig and her guru are generally viewed as the founders of the Chöd
    system.

&nbsp;

-   It is practised among Yundrung Bön traditions as well as the Nyingma
    and Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism .

&nbsp;

-   There are three different Chöd lineages. (1) Method based Father
    tantra lineage (2) Wisdom based Mother tantra lineage (3) Experience
    based Son tantra lineage

&nbsp;

-   Chöd combines praj\~nApAramitA philosophy with specific tantric
    rituals of vajrayAna.

&nbsp;

-   Chöd practitioners perform rituals in lonly caves, hidden
    monasteries , graveyards, mountains and in no mans land.

&nbsp;

-   Chöd practitioners visualise offering their bodies in a tantric
    feast in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the
    ultimate test.

&nbsp;

-   In Chöd sAdhanA the mindstream precipitates into a tulpa simulacrum
    of vajrayoginI. In sambhogakAya attained through visualization
    sAdhakas offers a gaNachakra of their own physical body to the four
    guests: ratnatraya, DAkinI, dharmapAla and beings of the
    bhavachakra, lokapAlas and the pretAs. The rite may be protracted
    with separate offerings to each maṇḍala of guests, or significantly
    abridged.

&nbsp;

-   As an internalization of an outer ritual, Chöd involves a form of
    self-sacrifice. Practitioner visualizes their own body as the
    offering at a ganachakra. The purpose of the practice is to engender
    a sense of victory and fearlessness.
