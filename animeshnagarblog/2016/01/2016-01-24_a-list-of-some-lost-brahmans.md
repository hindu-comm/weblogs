A list of some lost brAhmans.

From the infinite time our vedic tradition considered the brAhmans
granThas as veda . All maharshis of our glorious tradition declared ”
mantrabrAhmanyOvedAnAmadheya ” and ” mantrabrAhmanaM veda ityAchakshatE
“. Even in modern time excluding indologists and follower of dayAnanda
saraswatI , for all adherents of vedic tradition brAhmans too are veda.
Here I’m writing a short list ( vedA wise ) of some lost brAhmans, .
This list is traditional at all and uncritical from indologist point of
view. This list of lost brAhmans is based on the quotations quoted from
this brahmans in commentaries ( bhAshya ) on several vedic texts. Also
I have included brAhmans granThas which were mentioned in vedic texts ,
shrauta sutras , grihya sutras and bhAshyas . Although our glorious
tradition had 1000s of brAhmans but most of them are lost , this list
covers names of those brAhmans which are mentioned or quoted. Defiantly
many fragments of this brAhmans are still available and some are
published like kAthaka samkalana ( A collection of fragments of kAThaka
brAhmans ).
