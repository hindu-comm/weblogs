परमेकांशमेवन्तु परमेश्वरलोचने ।  
जयते भद्रकाली तु दारुकावधकारिणीम् ॥

In keraladesha Goddess bhadrakAlI is invoked with bAlAbhairavI vidhAnaM
hence bAlA mantra is present in famous dashAkShara mantra of bhadrakAlI
. Instead of bhadrakAlI devatA one can observe shaktibhairavI devatA in
Chhanda of dashAkShara mantra . She carries a trident, head of dArika,
sword, vattala and vetAla is her vehicle. She has three eyes, four or
eight hands. The appearance of Kali in Kerala is in sitting position.  
Local Keralalite legends of bhadrakAlI are recorded in saMskRRita and
malayAlabhAShA texts like shrIbhadrolpatti , dArukavadham ,
dArikavadham  
, shrIbhadrakAlImAhAtmyaM & bhadrakAlIsaptashatI .  
The story is also alive and narrates well in oral tradition. The entire
myth of dArikavadham of Kerala does not appear in any of the authentic
version of Purana but appears to have its origin in oral tradition such
as ‘thottampattu’ in various versions.  
There are small diversions in all of thses texts but main corpose of
story remains same .The word kAlI originates from the Sanskrit word
kAlakuTa. She got her name because she originates from the kAlakuTa of
paramashiva’s neck. The other version is that, the Malayalam word kaluka
means horror and one who created horror is known as kAlI.  
devagaNa and asuragaNa had a big fight in dwApara yuga and at the time
of the war viShNu killed all of the asuras except two woman dinapati and
danapati who manged to escape and hide in the underworld pAtAla. The two
women wanted restablishment of asuravaMsha and started penance to
appease Lord brahmA. Brahma appears infront of them and asked about
their wishes. They ask for sons . brahmA replied that, danapati’s
penance was not in full honest and that’s why she will give birth to a
foolish son and he will be the king of karkapurI and known as karka.
dinapati had penance in fullswing and she will get a strong son. His
name would be dAruka and he will become the king of dArukapurI .Then
brahmA gave little rice and water. These two women left and danapati
married bhadra and dinapati married bhikara the king. After both women
conceived and gave birth to two boys.karakana grow and one day he tried
to eat Sun as his food. Aditya got angry, threw an arrow on karakana and
he got killed. dinapati gave birth to dAruka and during his birth time,
sea became dirty, animals started runing .When he grows, he asked about
his relatives and enemies.When he grew up he came to know that their
clan had been destroyed by viShNu and took an oath to take revenge upon
him. His mother said that devagaNa were their enemies. viShNu gave help
to devagaNa to deafeat their ancestors. She asks him to go and make
penance to brahmA and get his wishes fulfilled. To fulfil this purpose
he went to gokarNakShetra and observed austerities.The penance continued
for a very long time and brahmA did not appear. dAruka starts his
penance in standing position, stands in water, and stands around fire.In
desperation, he began to cut off his head with a sword. No sooner had
the first drop of blood fallen on the ground then Lord brahmA appeared
before him and promised to give whatever boon he wanted. Demon dAruka
after intense ascetic practice, secured boons of invincibility from lord
brahmA . A drop of his blood would generate thousands of dAruka known as
upadArukagaNa and no one could kill him. Thus armed, dAruka began to
commit numerous depredations. When Shiva came to know of dAruka’s
misdeeds, he opened his fiery third eye (trinetra) and an enormous
flaming form of bhadrakAlI emerged to destroy dAruka. Shiva gave
trident(trishUla), sword(asi), mace(gadA), axe(parashu) in her hand and
sent her to kill dAruka .

bhagavati bhadrakAlI went through the forest and sought the help of
bloodthirsty vetAla, king of forest ghosts and spirit.Then bhadrakAlI
turned to war with dAruka. vetAla spread his enormous tongue over the
battlefield, drinking dAruka’s blood as bhadrakAlI cut off his head.  
She trew the intestines to pishAchagaNa and flesh to bhUtagaNa. vetAla
cut the thighs of dAruka and drank the remaing blood . dAruka’s wife
(mandodarI) discovering the death of her husband got angry and began to
do penance of shiva .Shiva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
from his body saying that the person on whom she sprinkled the sweat
drops would suffer from small pox. On her way back she met bhadrakAlI at
whom she threw the sweat drops to avenge for her husband’s
death.dAruka’s wife threw the sweat to bhadrakAlI’s body. Immediately
bhadrakAlI fell down on the floor and she got smallpox on her body.
bhadrakAlI asked for help. Hearing bhadrakAlI’s cries for help, Shiva
created ghaNTAkarNa from his earwax (karNamala). ghaNTAkarNa licked his
sister’s body to remove the small pox but out of modesty could not touch
her face which remained scarred.The furious bhadrakAlI returned to
kailAsha, holding dAruka’s head in her left hand.She offered the head of
dAruka to Shiva. Shiva gives blood from his little finger of right hand
and try appeases her with blood offerings . On seeing still fearful
nature goddess, Shiva attempted to calm her saying daughter dance up on
my body and release your temper. Doing this, she was satisfied and
henceforth began to receive offerings from devotees as a boon from
Shiva.
