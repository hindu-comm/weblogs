mahAchInakrama tArA

Some goddesses are commonly worshipped in Buddhist and Hindu Tantric
traditions. tArA, vajrayogini, ChinnamastA and vajravArAhI are best
examples. Usually it is not easy to trace how and when these adaptations
took place. In the case of mahAchInakrama tArA , a special form of tArA,
it has long been suspected that the goddess was imported from the
Buddhist pantheon into the Hindu tArAkula pantheon.Buddhist
mahAchInakrama tArA is iconographically identical to one of several
existing forms of tArA described in tArAkula tantras. Same mantra is
employed for both goddesses. Colophon of bhaTTAchArya’s edition of
sAdhanAmAlA states that nAgArjuna took the tradition of mahAchInakrama
tArA from the inhabitants of bhoTa country (भोटेषु उद्धृतम् ). He
identified bhoTadesha (Tibet ) with mahAchIna and concluded that
mahAchInakramatArA worshipped by native inhabitants of Tibet probably
professing the Bon religion of Tibet, entered the Buddhist pantheon with
the Tantric nAgArjuna in the 7CE. Western scholar Tucci identified
mahAchInadesha with kaNvara in the upper Sutlej valley.bhAratI held it
to be included in the entire region to the north of the himAlaya, Tibet
and at least parts of Mongolia and western China. BAgachi thought it to
refer to Mongolia. ShAstrI and Weller held that it refers to China.
Sarkar interpreting shaktisaNgamataNtra identified mahAchIna with Tibet
.  
mahAchInakramatArA is said to have been introduced to India by
vashiShTa, who received the transmission from buddha in mahAchInadesha..

> बौद्धदेशेऽथर्ववेदे महाचीने सदा ब्रज \|  
> तत्र गत्वा महाभावं विलोक्य मत्पदाम्बुजम् ॥

rudrayAmala and brahmayAmala have famous story of buddhavashiShTha
vRRittAntaH. brahmA’s son vashiShTa, who worshipped the goddess tArA
with austerities and vedic path unsuccessfully for a long time, is
advised by the goddess herself to go to the mahAchInadesha and follow
the atharvanic practice of left hand tArAkula. An intresting form of
godess is discribed in buddhavashiShThavRRittAntaH

> सा देवी परमा शक्तिः सर्वसङ्कटतारिणी । कोटिसूर्यप्रभा नीला

Buddhist mahAchInakrama tArA bears akShobhya on her head. This is
because the deities of the vajrayAna pantheon are considered emanations
of five families of buddhas ( paNchatathAgatakula). In buddhist
iconography of tArA he is desipated as buddha .

tArAkula discription of akShobhya on head of tArA is unusual and
requires explanation. akShobhya is interpreted as an epithet of shiva.
According to toDalatantra, shiva is called ‘ unshakeable’ because he
drank the deadly halAhala poison without agitation .akShobhya is genraly
decipated as having the form of a snake or akShobhya shiva sitting on a
snake on TArA’s head. While the snake is absent from the Buddhist
images. In the tArAkula tradition akShobhya also figures as the RiShi of
tArAmaNtra .

The bone ornaments (paNchamudrA) of the goddess were interpreted as a
garland of five skulls on her forehead . Buddhist kartRRi appears as a
kind of dagger with a diamond sceptre on its handle, in contrast to its
tArAkula representation as a pair of scissors .  
In Buddhist sAdhanAmAlA goddess’s mUla mantra is given as ***OM hrIM
trIM hUM phaT*** in Buddhist tradition , tArAkula tradition has
preserved the variant ***strIM*** for ***trIM***. The same mantra is
employed for ekajaTI who shares many iconographical characteristics with
mahAchInakramatArA . The mantra is said to grant eloquence and turn the
yogin into a great poet. This must be the effect of the seed syllable
***trIM*** contained in it, which, according to the passage produces
similar results when recited by itself. Meditative verses for mahAchIna
kramatArA are
