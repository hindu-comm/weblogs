Traces of lost paippalAda brAhman

Today we have only ***samhitA*** portion of ***paippalAda shAkhA***.
There are few traces of lost brAhman portion . It was also known as
***paippalAda gopatha brAhman*** / ***paippalAda brAhman*** .  
Even ***srI sankarAcharya*** quotes a mantra from lost brAhman / lost
aranyaka portion of paippalAda shAkhA in his ***bramhasutra bhAshya***
.

\[ bramha sutra 3.3.25 \]

( The last phrase of mantra is traced at PS 1.76.4cd but that’s not
upanishada Arambha .)  
At another instance he made citation from paippalAda samhitA.( 8.9.11 )

From this two example it is clear that till the time of ***Acharya*** ,
***paippalAda shAkhA*** was studied with **brAhman** and **Aranyaka
bhAga** and **srI shankarAcharya** was familiar with it. Next to him
***venkata mAdhava*** ( commentator of rig veda ) in his
**rigvedAnukramAnI** , referred to paippalAda brAhman.

***” SrI dhara”*** who is author ( **prayoga+ paddhati kAra** of
paippalAda shAkhA ) of “karmapanjikA ” quoted many untraceable verses
from gopatha brAhman .” ****My opinion is that they are from lost
paippalAda brAhman**** .”  
( Some verses quoted on behalf of **Gopatha** , are traced in
**atharvaveda parishishTha**. )

For example a ***“madakarma brAhman*”** quoted in **vedavrata** section
of ***karmapanjikA*** is untraceable , I think it belongs to lost
***paippalAda brAhman***.

A treatise “**prapapanch hridaya** ” of unknown authorship also informs
us of paippalAda brAhman.

” **paippalAda shAkhA** ( samhitA ) have 20 kAndas , which have riks and
yajus , where yajus are in majority. Total number of mantras are
**12,300**.****The paippalAda brAhman have 8 adhyAyas , containing
explanation of divya ( adhbhutAni ) , sAmpradAyika ( of yagniks i.e. of
vedic sacrifices ) ,prAyachhita ( atonement ) , abhichAra ( mantric
attack ).”****

**BramhAnda purana** also informs us of paippalAda BrAhman.

The **caranvyUha upanishad** of paippalAda shAkhA also describes the
paippalAda brAhman.  
[![image](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wpid-img_20141201_212602.jpg?w=700 "IMG_20141201_212602.JPG")](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wpid-img_20141201_212602.jpg)

On the basis of all this **pramAns** ( proofs ) following are my
hypothetical conclusion on lost paippalAda brAhman .  
” **paippalAda brAhman contains 100 prapAthaks within the 8 adhyAyas (
chapters ) and is divided in 2 bramhans i.e. purva brAhman and Uttara
brAhman .The total number of kandikAs are 5000 , in which 1000 are
mantras ( riks ) and remaining 4000 are brAhmanical prose .It covers
following four subjects .  
1) divya ( adhbhutAni )**

2\) sAmpradAyika ( explanation of vedic sacrifices , upanishads like
prashna etc belongs to this section .)

3\) prAyachhita ( atonement during any unfavorable condition )

4\) abhichAra ( mantric attack ). ”
