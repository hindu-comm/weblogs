An introduction to vaikhAnasa kalpa sutraM

The vaikhAnasa as a community are temple priests. They regard themselves
as ordained by birth to be temple priests and they are enjoined not to
follow other avocation in life.  
To “***vikhanas muni*** ” lord vishnu taught at the very beginning of
creation the doctrine subsequently celebrated as vaikhAnasa
kalpa-sutraM, which comprehends all the Vedas and contains the secret
teaching of the Vedic lore.

And ***sage vikhanasa*** in his turn briefly communicated this
doctrine to the four sages. No doubt the ***VaikhAnasa kalpa sutraM***
is an ancient one, and what is more important, it is comprehensive,
dealing as it does with all respects of ‘***kalpa***‘ ( ***srauta***,
***smArta*** or ***grihya***, ***dharma*** and ***sulba***). By common
consent, this text is held to be the source for all the later
***vaikhAnasa texts*** and manuals.  
The ***vaikhAnasa*** school retained vishnu in his Vedic context and
advocated the worship of Vishnu with the six Vedic hymns addressed to
vishnu (***shadvaishnavam***). It may be noted that this scriptural lore
aligned itself firmly and uncompromisingly to the Vedic wisdom ,more
specifically to the ‘***aukheya shAkhA’ of krishna-yajurveda*** and was
therefore described as ‘***vaidika***‘ in contradistinction to the other
approaches which incorporated the ***tAntrika*** or folk practices.

sutra](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/wpid-img_20141213_2123101.jpg?w=700 "IMG_20141213_212310.JPG")

Even now, the vaikhAnasa priests, at home and in the temple, insist on
first performing the fire-ritual prescribed in the Vedas, and then
worshipping Vishnu, as the supreme spirit. In fact, the ***vaikhAnasa***
is the only group among temple-priests to have a kalpa-sutra of their
own.  
The ***Kalpa sutraM*** consist of 32 chapters. Among them are ***7
grihya sutra***, ***3 dharma sutra***, ***21 srauta sutra*** and ***1
pravara sutra***. The worship of vishnu was tantamount to the
performance of a great Vedic sacrifice. The
***vaikhAnasa-kalpa-sutra***, therefore, prescribe the worship of vishnu
in the household as well as in the temple, along with the Vedic rituals
that were necessary and sufficient. It is not surprising that the Vedic
rituals were gradually subordinated to the worship of Vishnu; but the
Vedic rituals were never entirely given up. The ***vaikhAnasa*** are
probably the only group of ***Agama*** adherents who rely heavily on
Kalpa-sutra. The ***vaikhanasa kalpa-sutra***, has four distinct
divisions:  
***1. srauta,***  
***2. smArta (Grihya),***  
***3. pravara***  
***4. dharma,***  
With the ***sulba-sutra*** prescriptions accommodated in the first two
divisions.

****srauta sutraM****

The first division *srauta sutraM* begins with the settling up of the
ritual fire (***agnyAdhana***) and goes on till the ritual known as
***soma samstha***. It includes rituals like daily (***nitya***) and
occasional (***naimittIka***) and also ***prAyaschittas*** for these. In
all it contains 21 rites and expiations for:    
***1) sapta havir yagnas,***  
***2) sapta soma yagnas ***  
***3) sapta pAka yagnas.***

**SrlnivAsa diksita’s vyAkhyA** is there on the srauta sutraM, really is
a **prayoga-vrtti,** that is a brief explanation of a practical manual
for the use of officiating priests, and accordingly rather a paraphrase
than an explanation of the words of sutra.

****Grihya sutra****

The second one ***grihya Sutra*** consists o***f 7 prasnas*** with
details ranging from ***ashtadasa sAriraka samskaras***,
***sandhyAvandana vidhI, punyAhaM, agni pratishthA, AghAram, Antha
homaM, vAstu homaM, Rites for nitya, pAka, havir yagnas, soma yagnas,
grihArcha Methods, Funeral rites, and expiatory rites for astadasa
sAariraka samskarAs.*** The Grihya sutras relate to life in the
household and deal with 18 sacramental rites for the individual which
are meant to cleanse the physical body and render it fit for spiritual
progress. So the ***vaikhAnasa*** have the rites beginning with those
connected with birth and ending with the rites regarding death and
cremation . Among the sacraments included is ***vishnu-bali*** which is
unique for the ***vaikhAnasa***. The texts also deal with the
installation and worship of the icons at home and other details
pertaining to religious observances.  
Many mantras which, though foreign to the *taittarIya***** texts, are
quoted only by their opening words in the **vaikhAnasa grihya sutraM,**
are taken from the **Mantra-Samhita** of this community,( famously known
as **vaikhAnasa mantra prashna** ) the first four chapters (**prasna**)
of which run parallel to the grihya sutra . The chapters 5—8 of this
**vaikhAnasa mantra samhitA ( prashna )** —which cannot in its present
redaction be contemporaneous with the sutras of this community—are
intended to accompany the complete ritual of the **vaikhAnasa** as
described in *kashyapa’s manual.* The whole collection is still in use.
The mantras contained in chapter 9, known as **visnudaivatyaM**, are not
found in any other kalpa sutraM or Vedic text. Most of its **106**
mantras—are in praise of vishnu. Their language resembles that of the
**Vedic purUsha and SrI sukta**.  
**pitrumedha sutras** are included in grihya sutraM.  
Chapter 5 of grihya sutra is devoted to the funeral rites—for the
**AhitAgni** as well as the common householder and their wives—be it
that the last sections (13—15) deal with the *srADdha rites.***** The
subjects treated are: the rites in the house of the deceased person, the
conveyance of the dead body to the cremation ground; the dead body on
the pyre; the cremation; the return of those who have attended the
cremation; the rites to be observed during the first ten days; abnormal
death; death of little children. By way of introduction section I deals
with the moribund person and the two paths the prospect of which is in
this late text held out to the dying—viz. that by which one reaches
without returning the “place of brahman” and that by which one
returns—as well as with the process of dying. Section 8 treats of the
disposal of the dead body of ascetics who have no ritual fires; they are
interred in sitting posture. In section 11 the author deals with persons
whose cremation is not allowed: those who die a violent death, suicides,
drunkards, those who have met with an accident, etc. There are some
peculiarities of minor importance.

****dharama sutraM****

The dharma dutras which are complete in three chapters (***prasnas***)
deal with religious life and conduct of different groups and castes of
people, responsibilities and duties in different states of life (
***Asrama dharmas***), the characteristic conducts of hermits,
***renunciants*** and such matter. There are also details concerning the
eight-fold technique of yoga and other spiritual practices.

***pravara sutraM***

pravarasutram Sutra concerns itself with the lineage of several
***rishis*** with special reference to the ***vaikhAnasa*** community.
It contains one chapter. In essence.

The ***vaikhanasa kalpa sutra*** provides the essential code of conduct
for a ***vaikhAnasa*** in his personal, familial and social settings.
The test is intended to enable him to discharge his duties and
responsibilities with ability and wisdom, which are occasioned by the
association of relevant Vedic mantras with all corresponding kriyas.  
Better to end with;  
**नारायणः पिता यस्य माताश्चापि हरि प्रिया । भ्रुग्वादि मुनयः
शिष्यास्तस्मै विखनसे नमः ॥**
