maitrAyanI-rUdraM

**MaitrAyans** were descendants of **kaThas**. Again **maitrAyana** was
a term used by group of 12 **yaju shAkhAs** .( 7 were the **mUla
maitrAyans** + 5 were **Upa maitrAyans** ).  
The **gurU paramparA** of maitrAyanI shAkhA is as follows .  
**charakAcharya** imparted this yajurveda to **kaThAcharya**, One among
his 12 shishya was **maitrAyan maharshI** .  
**maitrAyan maharshI** impart this yajurveda to 7 shishyas.  
Namely  
**1) mAnava** ( author of mAnava kalpasutra )  
**2) vArAha** ( maitreya , son of maitrAyan maharshI , author of vArAha
kalpa sutra )  
**3) dundubha  
4) Ekeya  
5) hAridrAvIya  
6) shyAmA  
7) shyAmAyayan**

Again **haridrAviyAcharya** imaparted this yajurveda to 5 shishyas
.Namely

**5.1) vAsvIya  
5.2) AsurIna  
5.3) GArgya** ( son of garga rishI )  
**5.4) shArkarakshyA  
5.5) mArga  
**

shAkhA](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/wpid-img_20141125_022115.jpg?w=700 "IMG_20141125_022115.JPG")

Among total of twelve , even today we have two shAkhAs surviving
,namely  
**1) maitrAyanI shAkhA in mAnava sub recension**

It is prevalent in Maharashtra near the nagapur , the adherents are
followers of mAnava kalpa sutra

**2)maitrAyanI shAkhA in vArAha sub recencion  
**  
It is prevalent in Gujarat , mostly in community of **mODha brAhmans.**
The followers are adherents of vArAha kalpa sutra.  
Long time ago a mODha brAhmana ” **SrI harshajI suta SrI rAmakrIshna
shAstrI** ” famed as ” **pandita pAthaka** ” had published a ritual
manual of this shAkhA under title ” **maitrAyanI Ahanika-darpana**
“.Unfortunately this book is out of print , only few copies are there of
this book, mostly in private possession.

According to oral tradition of maitrAyans , **dundubha shAkhA** was
prevalent in **Kashmir desha** , **Ekeya** in **SaurAshTra kshetra** ( A
west-southern portion of Gujarat) . **gArgya shAkhA** was studied in
present **Vraja khetra** ( present brija ) , **AsurIna shAkhA** was
prevalent at **gAndhAra** ( present Afghanistan) . **hAridrAvIya
shAkhA** was studied in **marU desha** i.e. present Gujarat+ Rajasthan (
possibly near the **haridrA sarovara kshetra** ).  
Even in **nirUkta** we get a small fragment of **hAridrAvIya shAkhA.**

![A fragment describing rUdratVa from hAridrAvIya
shAkhA](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/wpid-img_20141125_113732.jpg?w=700 "IMG_20141125_113732.JPG")

With slight variation in recitation style the **rUdraM** is common to
both **upashAkhAs**.  
It has two parts

**1) namakaM**

**namakaM** is housed in **2 kAnda** ( **also known as madhyam kAnda**
*)* , **prapAThaka 9 , anuvAka 1-10**.  
In **srauta** context , both mAnava and vArAha srauta sutra employ this
hymn in **shatarUdrIya homa** of agnichayan ritual.

![( from mAnava srauta sutra

In grihya context **shatarUdrIya** hymns are used in **shulagava
yagya** and in ceremony of marriage . When groom with bride returns to
his home , and counters special places then **bramhA / Adhavaru**
recites some mantras .

2\) **chamakaM**

**chamakaM** is housed in **2 kAnda** ( also known as madhyam kAnda ) ,
**prapAThaka 11 , anuvAka 1-6**.  
The srauta context of chamakaM is in **vasoRdhArA homa** of agnichayan
ritual.

The hymn invokes, apart from agni and vishnu at the beginning, a
pantheon of Vedic deities that are successively linked with Indra to
enable the yajamAna or sacrificer/patron to successfully perform Vedic
fire sacrifices .
