kapishThala rudrIya

There was a time , **kapishThala shAkhA** was studied in Maharashtra ,
Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh.  
The last adherents of this shAkhA surviving in **Maharashtra**, still
refer to this fact in order to enhance their social position. While the
**kapishThala** **shAkhA** still was well-known to the commentators
until the end of the first millennium there followed a retreat of the
school to a few areas in Central India. This is matched by the evidence
of inscriptions and copper plates during the last few centuries, the
**kapishThalas** could only survive in some districts of Northern and
Eastern Maharashtra and central part of Madhya Pradesh . Their numbers
have concentrated more and more at **Nagpur** where for the first time
since the medieval period they were accorded some support by the
**Bhonsle dynasty**.The retreat of this school has been accompanied by
increasing loss of their written and oral traditions: Surrounded on all
sides by the strong and expanding traditions of the **shukla and krishna
yajurvedIns** *. Benefited by medieval monarchs, the charak
**kapisThalas** of Nagpur at length imported the traditions of the
**maitrAyani shAkhA** (in the **mAnav** sub recension i.e. their sutra
is **mAnav** ) from **Nasik** and **Nandurbar**which have been
cultivated ever since. However, there are a few indications that even
today manuscripts and remnants of the oral and ritual traditions of the
**charak kapishThalas** still survive.  
The following **kapishThala rUdrIya** is one of orally preserved portion
of **kapishThala** tradition.*

**kapishThala rUdrIya** have two parts namely  
**1) namakaM**  
It is housed in 27^th chapter ,of kapisThal samhitA, anuvAka 1-6 . (
This portion contains a total of 6 anuvAka )  
The original context of the **namakaM** *according* to my opinion ( on
behalf of lost **kapisThala srauta sutra** ) is in **shatarUdrIya
homa** of agnichayan ritual.

**2) chamakaM**  
It is housed in 28^th+29^th ( partially ) chapters of kAthaka samhitA,
anuvaka 7-11, 1anuvaka of 29^th chapter. The original context of the
chamakaM according to lost kapishThala srauta sutra is the piling up of
the fire-altar of chayan . The hymn invokes, apart from agni and vishnu
at the beginning, a pantheon of Vedic deities that are successively
linked with Indra to enable the yajamAna or sacrificer/patron to
successfully perform Vedic fire sacrifices .
