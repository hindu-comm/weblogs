BaijavApa grihya sutra – The lost grihya sutra of shukla yajur veda

Apart from famous **pAraskara** ***grihya sutra** , their was another
grihya sutra ( **baijavApa grihya sutra** ) followed by some of **shukla
yajurvedins.** Some fragments have been preserved of a **baijavApa
grihya sutra** .The charanvyuha ( famously known as **kAtIya
charanvyuha** among followers of shukla yajur veda ) mentions the
**baijavApa** as one of the fifteen divisions of the shukla yajur veda
. References to the kalpa sutra of this school are made by **bhatta
kumArila** (8th cent.) \[ see **tantravArtika** 1.3.10 \] and **pit\~ru
bhuti** (probably 9th cent.), and its grihya sutra is extensively quoted
by several authors between the 11th and 16th centuries,some among them
are **aparArka** (first half of the 12th century) , **hemAnda pandit**
( author of hemAdri / **chaturvarga chintAmani )**, unknown author of
**kratyakalpatarU** .  
Among modern writers this sutra is quoted in **samskAra ratnamAla of
bhatta gopinAtha dikshIta**.  
All possible fragments I was able to collect are given below.
