kAthak sandhyAvandan prayoga

**SandhyAvandana** is a basic ritual that a brAhman should observe
after **upanayan** *till death .The tradition of **kaThas** ( kashmiri
brAhmans )  
) is declining fast.  
I have used a ritual manual of **satIsara vidwAns** for this study.  
There are several **akshara ashuddhis** ( peculiarities due to
pronunciation ) in manual .Yet I have not corrected them because they
are due to pronunciation “**what they pronounce they had written that
with out concerning authentic text** ” .  
**SandhyAvandan of *kaThaka yajurvedins* have been described at last
with instructions in Hindi for every step.  
The mantras used in** **prayoga*** *are from **kAThaka** samhitA and are
unaccented.  
A small tantric influence is also there. I was unable to trace any
authentic source for this kAthaka sandhyA prayoga .Only tradition
followed by **satIsara brAhmans*** *( satIsara brAhmans are one among
subdivisions of kashmiri brAhmans ) was source for this prayoga .  
I’m also not aware of any variation due to family traditions, region ,
subdivision among kAthakas .  
Even kashmiri brAhmans have peculiar names for this steps which are
against the standard names and are quite misleading and confusing.( for
example they use word tarapan for dropping the water i.e. vinIyoga )  
This peculiarities are due to not well preserved written text and
consciousness living tradition.*
