Eternal Sound Of Veda

Blossoms of my heart dance in delight,  
Eyes of mine glad in devine  
When I use to hear on twilight,  
The eternal sound of veda by bramhacharins.

Young bramchacharin reciting the sounds ,  
filling my ears with melodic bliss,  
recharging me , healing my wounds .  
Let my cosmos chant its my wish .

Chants of veda in archetype \* and ectype\* manner  
recitied by pupils and achArya ,  
fixed by sages of past in same genre.  
May this unbroken chain remains continues.

Sri Rudram , durga suktam and chants of ArUna flag\* ,  
pseudo recitation of nambothiri guys.  
samaganas of JaminEyas and Kauthumas , let me to glad,  
reminds me the glory of immersed Suns rays .
