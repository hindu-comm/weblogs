Two lost grihya sutras of Atharva veda

Kaushika grihya sutra is the only sutra followed by Atharvavedins for
Srauta and smarta rites. Beside Kaushika grihya sutra two more grihya
sutra belongs to Atharva veda , namely  
1) Paithinasa Grihya sutra  
2) Agastya Grihya sutra  
The evidence for there existence is traced in ********Karmapanjika ( of
Paithinasa Grihya sutra), Prapancha-Hridaya ( of Agastya Grihya sutra )
.********

***1) Paithinasa Grihya Sutra:***

Compiler of *Karmapanjika* ****Srī Dhara**** quotes **some** sutras from
*paithinasa grihya sutra* and States that the base for *karmapanjika* is
*paithinasa sutra of Paipalada shakha* belonging to Atharvan veda.This
means that till the time ****Srī dhara,*** **paithinas sutra***
existed and *Utkal bramhans (Orrisan bramhans* ) were follower of this
sutra , but with influence of time and dominating Yajurvedic schools (
Kanwa shakha of yajur veda ), this sutra got lost in darkness of time.  
( My critic of Yajurvedic influence is true ,most of paipaladins have
given up Atharvan shakha and are learning Kanwa shakha due to more
opportunities of income from yajan-yAjan ).  
But due to some dedicated Atharvan bramhans we posses” Karmapanjika “a
paddhati grantha based on Paithinasa sutra.Yet in small number but, some
atharvans are till the date studying Paipalada shakha and performs all
rites and rituals by the help of ****Karmapanjika****.  
Due to unavailability of date of ***Srī Dhara swamin*** we are unable to
trace the date till which our ***sutra*** existed.

***2) Agastya Grihya Sutra:***

***Prapancha- Hridya*** describes an another grihya sutra ( in quite
pseudo manner belonging to atharvan veda paipplada shakha in it’s
**ShAdanga Prakrana)**  
I’m unable to trace the author of the treatise ***Prapancha- Hridaya***
,but after studying it  
critically it is clear that this grantha was compiled after the time of
***Bhatta Kumarila*** and ***Prabhakar*** .( i.e. after 7 th century )

According to description in this treatise **,Agastya muni** compiled
***Agastya Grihya Sutra ,*** which was having ***7 chapter*** **.** It
belongs to ***Paippalada shakha of Athar*va veda.** Even in it’s **veda
prakrana** it describes a bramhana ( not gopatha bramhana ) with 8
chapters affiliated to Paippalada shakha .

So these are few traces of this lost sutras.It is quite interesting to
see that, both of these sutras belongs to Paipalada shakha . I think
like kaushika sutra ( 4 shakhas of atharva veda follow it namely
Shaunak,Bramhavada,Jalad,JAjal ) it is probability that some other lost
shakhas also follow this two sutras.
