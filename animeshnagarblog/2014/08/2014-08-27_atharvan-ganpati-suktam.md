Atharvan Ganpati Suktam

Apart from the famous ****ganpati atharva shIrsha****,atharvans also
posses sukta dedicated to ganpati *from samhita portion.(A.S. 1.18.1-4
)*  
RishI for the ganapati sukta is ***dravinodA*** ( the one who is giver
of wealth or the one who is granted wealth by lord ).This is only sukta
by ***dravinodA*** rishI found in Saunaka samhita.  
Deity of the sukta is ***v******inAyaka*** ( in case of ***samputa*** by
**vakratUnda mantra** deity is ***vakratUnda ganapati***. )  
Chhandas are described in viniyoga portion.  
( ***dravinodA rishI*** ***\|\| v***inAyaka***** **devatA \|\|***
***brahatI , jagatI , tristup , anushtup ChhandA)***

( I am giving the sukta in picture format due to reason of vedic svara
and ease in saving picture. Below is it’s translation in English with
devanAgari transliteration )

**निर् लक्ष्म्यं ललाम्यं निर् अरातिं सुवामसि । अथ या भद्रा तानि नः
प्रजाया अरातिं नयामसि ।।1।।**  
We the worshippers remove the marks of ill fortune and by gress of lord
( ***vinAyaka*** ) accepts the sign of fortune and wealth.

***निर् अरणिं सविता साविषक् पदोर् निर् हस्तयोर् वरुणो मित्रो अर्यमा
।***  
***निर् अस्मभ्यम् अनुमती रराणा प्रेमां देवा असाविषुः सौभगाय ।।2।।***

Oh ***savitA*** ( Ganapati described as savita” the creater” ) ,
***varUna*** ( Ganapati described as “destroyer of sins “), ***aryamA***
( sun in form of Ganapati as caretaker ) please remove the inauspicious
signs and ill luck from our body parts( from tip of fingure to foot )
.Oh ***anumatI*** ( siddhi and bhuddhi described )the motivater please
remove the the obstacles and fulfill our wishes.  
Rishi indirectly using qualitative names pray to ganapati and his
shaktis .

***यत् त आत्मनि तन्वां घोरम् अस्ति यद् वा केशेषु प्रतिचक्षणे वा ।***  
***सर्वं तद् वाचाप हन्मो वयं देवस् त्वा सविता सूदयतु ।।3।।***

Thou oh man ,by the power of lord ( vinayaka ) and mantra ,we remove the
ill signs from your body, soul, hairs, eyes.Let Ganapati ( described as
savita” the creater” ) inspire us. ( in good deeds )

***रिश्यपदीं वृषदतीं गोषेधां विधमाम् उत ।***  
***विलीढ्ह्यं ललाम्यं ता अस्मन् नाशयामसि ।।4।\|  
***  
We remove by ***mantrabala*** the inauspicious signs of femal body
having foot like dear , ox like teeth, posture of walking like cow (
vashA not genral cow ) , use of abusive words from oh femel thou.
