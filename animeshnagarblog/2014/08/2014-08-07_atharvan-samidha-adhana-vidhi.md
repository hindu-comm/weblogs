Atharvan Samidha Adhana Prayoga

 \|\| Samidha Adhanam \|\|

Only bramhacharis have to perform samidha adhana. Bramahcharis should
do it before Kamokarshita japam ( In actuality bramhachari should
perform it on daily basis like all other nityakarma , sandhya vandan ,
savadhyaya etc .But rarely modern bramchari performs it . )
