VaitAna Srauta SutrA – A introduction

The srauta sutra belonging to *Atharvanic tradition* is ***Vaitana
Srauta sutra*** .  
It is only available srauta sutra to Atharva veda.  
Yet a single manuscript of ***Kaushika Srauta Sutra*** is in possession
of ***Maharshi Mahesha yogi institution***.

Vaitana srauta sutra is single granta which throws light on Atharvanic
srauta tradition.  
It consists of ***8 chapters and 43*** ***kandika* ( AnuvAka )**  
The subject of ***Vaitana srauta sutra*** is arranged in the same order
of that ***pAraskar Srauta*** ****Sutra**** but with originality of
*atharvanic* tradition. A text with notes and indices is published by
sir Richard Grabe unde the title ” ***vaitāna sūtra : the ritual of
Atharvaveda “.***  
There is single known commentary ***” AkshEpa ”*** on *vaitana sutra*
by ***Sri*** ***SomAditya.***  
The name Vaitana sutra is coined due to ***pravachan-kartA rishi ”
VaitAyan Maharshi “.***  
According to some indologists the term is coined due to the first sutra
it self.  
***atha vitānasya \| brahmā karmāni brahmavedavid dakshinato vidhivad
upaviśati vāgyataḥ \|\|1\|\|***

**(** I personally don’t support there view that ***vaitAna term is
coined due to first sutra .***  
I suppose this name ***vaitAna*** is due to ***pravachan-kartA rishi*
,** even same is true in case of KatyAyan, ApastambA , BhAradwaja ,
HiranyakEshin, Vadhula and other Sutras. )  
There are 6 chapters supplement to ***vaitAna*** sutra they are known
as ***Yajna-Prayachhita AdhyayA*** or alternatively ***ShEsha
sutrA.***  
With every manuscript of ***vaitAna*** **sutra** we have this ***ShEsha
