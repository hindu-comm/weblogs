Paithinasi – Dharma shastra attributed to Atharva veda

***P******aithinas smriti*** famously known as ***Paithinasi*** is the
dharma shastra belonging to Atharva veda . Yet ***Angirasa smriti ,
Aushnas smriti*** might also be considered as smriti texts belonging to
***Atharva veda.***But after studying them critically I think there is
no direct relation of these two with **Bramha veda.**But in case of
***paithinasi*** ,it possesses direct relationship, it quotes mantras
from samhita ( Both paipalada and Shaunak ) of Atharvan veda .  
For example in ***Bramhachari khanda*** it indicates SamA Sinchatu…… \[
A.S-7.33.1\] mantra , which is in both Atharvan samhitas .Even
***Kaushika*** **sutra** implies same mantra for paryukshan  
before and after samidhaadhanm.  
Even in ***Shraddha khanda*** it gives same vidhi as of ***Atharvan
parishishtha*** for shraddha .  
The mantra ***Yad annadha…..***  
also belongs to ***Atharvan veda.***  
( The authorship of some atharvan parishishtha is also attributed to
***Paithinasa Acharya*** .)  
**yA dIvyA ….** Mantra also belongs to ***Atharvan veda.***  
These are some examples.  
According to my information lost ***paithinasi had 7 khandas and shlokas
about 1000-1500***. ( in anushtup meter mostly )  
Some part ***( partial fragments)*** of three khandas are known out of
seven because we get their fragments in dharmashastra- nibhandhas of
medieval period .**( Krityakalpataru , Dharmasindhu , HemAdri also known
as Chaturvarga cintamani , Viramitrodya , Smriti chandrika ).** I have
traced names of remaining khandas by the help of ***Karma-Panjika ,
Karma- Sammuchya, paipalad grihya paddhati*** these are ***paddhati
grantas*** of ***paipalada atharva vedins*** used till date by Orrisan
bramhans ( Utkal bramhans ).***Karma panjika*** and ***Karma
sammuchya*** also quotes ***sutras*** from ***Paithinasi Grihya sutra***
which is lost grihya sutra of Paipalada shakha. ***The Karmapañjikā***
(***KP***), a text whose existence first taken note of by
**Bhattacharyya** , has been used here and there, but has nowhere been
discussed, by Bhattacharya in his edition of ***paipplada*** samhita (
***Utkal patha*** or ***Orrisan patha*** ) PS 1-15. The ***KP*** claims
to follow an otherwise lost ***Sūtra*** of ***paithinasa*** , and at
several points quotes directly from this ***Sūtra***. I have not yet
been able to find any evidence about the author of the KP,
***Śrīdhar***a. ***Paithīnasi’s*** work referred to in the KP may have
been a counterpart of the ***Kauśikasūtra*** of the ***Śaunaka Śākhā***,
i.e. a ***Grihyasūtra*** of the ***Paippalāda Śākhā,*** or an
***Atharvavedic Dharmasūtra (of the Paippalāda Śākhā).*** Confirmation
of these interesting possibilities requires further intensive study.For
example in vedavrata section of ***Karmapañjikā*** posses quotes from
paithinasi.  
“agnyādheyaṃ svadhāṃ caiva yajñadānavratāni ca \| vedavrataṃ vṣotsargaṃ
cūḍākaraṇamekhalā \| māṅgalyam tatrādau śiṣyaḥ abhiṣekaṃ ca malamāse
vivarjayed iti ǁ” This is a single example of fragment from
***Karmapañjikā .*** ***Karmapañjikā*** contains lots of fragments from
samanya dharma & Paribhasha section of paithinasi .  
A list of names of seven ***khandas*** is given below .( It is not
critical ,but based on primary information, I am working on this
treatise )

***1) ParibhAshA Khanda***  
***2) SAmAnya dharma khanda***  
***3) BramhachArI khanda***  
***4) Grahasta khanda***  
***5) ShrAddha khanda***  
***6) AdhikAra khanda***  
*** (dAyabhAga khanda )***  
***7) Prayachhita khanda***

Authorship of these treaties is attributed to” **MaUslI putrA –
PaithInasa “.**Paithinasa acharya is described as An authority ***(
PurvA AcharyA )*** in Kaushika sutra. I’m trying to collect all
fragments of paithinasi and will publish this fragments under a title ”
***Paithinasi – revived again ”***
