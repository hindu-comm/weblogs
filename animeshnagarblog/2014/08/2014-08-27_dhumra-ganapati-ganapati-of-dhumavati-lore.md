Dhumra Ganapati- Ganapati of Dhumavati lore

In north Indian trantric tradition each mahavidya is assigned by a
form of ganpati.  
With each of 10 mahAvidya one or more ganpati is associated .For example
Bagalamukhi – Haridra ganpati, Matangi – nritya ganpati ( matang ganpati
)  
In case of Dhumavati , Dhumra ganpati is assigned i.e. Dhumra ganpati is
ganpati of Dhumavati mahavidya.

He is described as gloomy, old, wearing dirty white clothes. Having a
garland of human skull with a smokey complexion.Having four hands in
which he holds skull cup(kapAla) , danda (stick), Damru ( hand drum )
and varamudra ( fruit giving gesture ).

He is to be worshipped before dhumavati in ***somya and shanti
karma***.***( mostly by dakshinachAra , shAbar vidhi )***  
In ***ugra karma ( in case of very emergency and less time he is also
worshipped but by means of aghorAchar, vAmAchara only)*** even ganapati
is not worshiped.  
RishI of dhumra ganapati mantra is ***aghora*** and ***dhumra
ganapati*** is devata with ***yajusha*** chhanda.  
Dhumra ganapati mantra is of ***11 latters*** with couple of dhumavati
beeja instead of omkara.  
There are also some **shabar** and **aghora** mantras belonging to him
in which ***aghora*** mantra is most powerful and rapid fruit giver.  
Most of dhumavati sadhaka recites shabar dhumra ganapati mantra 21 times
before the actual dhumavati mantra sadhana for removal of obstacles.
This form of ganapati is worshipped by the ***vAmamArga*** using 5 M’s
for destruction of enemy .  
He also can be worshipped by ***dakshinachara*** for destruction of
karmic layers, grahadoshA and removal of obstacles.  
I’m not giving the mantra due to secrecy of mantra and sampradaya.
