Finding Dattatreya ……

Having left my home  
kith less for you ,I roam  
in search of oh ! ***Dattatreya***  
son ! of ***Atri*** & ***Ansuya*** .

When I asked the the tree  
have you seen the one who is free,  
Tree said to me” I haven’t seen ”  
I asked sky have you seen him.

I asked Smokey ***dhuni*** devine  
Have you seen ***datta*** ***digamabara*** of mine.  
Flames of bliss said to me oh seeker  
Search him inside and drink ***tattva*** liquor.

Now I’m a drinker who drinks delight,  
Finds ***datta*** in my heart full of light,  
I was a fool searching him outside,  
***dhuni*** guided me to vision inside.

My eyes glows and words dance,  
I’m glad to watch the inner romance.  
My experiences sings the only song ,  
Find ***datta inside , no need to roam………….***
