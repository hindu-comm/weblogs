Dhumavati tantra , Anga vidya and kalpas

Following 12 ***vidyas*** are the ***anga vidya*** of dhumavati .  
Yet there are few sadhaks who are devoted to smokey goddess.  
Mostly ***shabar mantra*** of ***dhumavati*** is popular among sadhaks
which is immediately siddhī giver.So it is rare in practice to get
initiated in pure ***Shastriya*** and ***tantric*** manner for this Maha
vidya .  
Aghor and shabar mantras of dhumavati are mainly practiced due to
immediate impact and fruit.***Aghor and shabar*** mantras neither
needs viniyoga ,rishiyAdinayAsa  
nor anga vidyas , only chanting them in manner your guru told is
sufficient. One of such shabar mantra is *Charpatbhanjan natha pranita
mantra. “धूम्रासपर्या कल्प पद्धति”*  
*Is* one of few paddhati granthas belonging to this mahavidya.  
*Dhumavati tantra , Dhumavati kalp* , Dhumra kalp , dhumra- varahi
tantra , portion of kalamrityu tantra are few authoritative granthas of
this lore.  
Note that there is no ***shiva*** ( concert ) for this mahavidya shakti
is in widow and old form, but bhairava is mentioned there in aghor
paddhati, ***Aghor bhairava*** (For Ugra karma )

***(dhyana of aghor bhairava***

***त्रिपाद हस्त नयनं नीलांजनं चयोपमं,***  
***शूलासि सूची हस्तं च घोर दंष्ट्राटट् हासिनम् \|\|***

***Mantra is*** ***धूं धूं******अघोर रुद्राय नमः***  
***Some times shabar aghor mantra is also used )***  
and Kalabhairava ( for saumya karma ).  
\*  
Mantra for kala bhairava is ***Dhum Dhum kalabhairavaya namah***
