The following passage from ***agniveshya*** ***grihya*** ***sutra***
describes the yagnopavitham dharan vidhi.  
Those who are well versed with ***taitarIya samhItA*** will able to
trace the mantras. Most of mantras are from ***taitarIya* shAkhA .**The
mantra for yagnopavitha dharan is quite different from other **sutra (
shAkhA ).**  
Temple priests of ” ***adIkElAsha Ksetra ”,*** an old and reputed  
place of pilgrimage, some 70 miles to the south of the  
town of ***Tanjore*** follows this sutra. Only those  
belonging to this Sutra are permitted to enter the *garbha-*  
*griha or officiate as priests* in that temple. The tradition  
being that, at the beginning of *kaliyuga* ***Siva*** appeared at  
the place before his devotees and ordained that only ***agniveshya***
***sutra*** ***followers*** should officiate as priests in this
temple  
and appointed the fore-fathers of the present priests as  
hereditary ***archakas*** there. There are about only ***eleven***  
***families*** following this Sutra and they are all, in one way  
or other, related to each other, as may naturally be expected  
in the case of a small group marooned in the midst of aliengroups.

( for sake of preservation of lesser practiced veda shakhas and
respectively there rituals I have posted this post. Other sutra
followers i.e. Apastamba , boudhAyan ,vAdhula posses there own vidhi.
I’m not aware about any variation in actual practise from grihya sutra
, by this sutra followers. )
