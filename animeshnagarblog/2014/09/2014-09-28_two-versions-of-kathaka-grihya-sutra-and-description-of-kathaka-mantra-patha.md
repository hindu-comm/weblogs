Two versions of kAthaka grihya sutra and description of  kAthaka mantra pAtha

The ***kAthaka grihyasutra***, also known as ***laugAkshi
grihyasutra*** is the household ( grihya ) manual of those who follow
any of ***kAthaka shAkhA*** of ***krishna yajur veda.*** ** Actually
***vaishampAyan*** imparted this ***yajurveda*** to ***katha Acharya***
, then he imparted his knowledge of ***yajurveda*** to 12 **shishyAs**
namely  
***1) charaka***  
***2) Avhraka***  
***3)bhrAjishthal katha***  
***4) prAchya katha***  
***5) kapishthala katha***  
***6) vArAyanIya***  
***7) chArAyanIya***  
***8) shveta***  
***9) shvetAshavatar***  
***10) Aupamanyava***  
***11) pAtandineya***  
***12) maitrAyana***  
Then they imparted this to their ***shishyAs*** so this formed ***12
shAkhAs*** of ***katha*** ***yajurveda*** . Hence every ***shAkhA***
among 12 ***shAkhAs*** is known as ***kAthaka*** .***kAthak*** is not
name of independent ***shAkhA*** but a term used by group of ***12***
***shAkhAs*** in remembrance of ***katha Achary***. Even in printed text
of ***kAthak samhitA*** we observe

According to the brahmins of kashmir who have held the rules given in
this manual in esteem for a long time ,the author is ***laugAkshi*** .
***kashmirians*** studied it intensively .

It have two distinct versions for two different branches of ***krishna
yajurveda*** ( namely ***caraka shAkhA*** and **cArAnIya** ).  
1) ***sa-mantraka*** ******* **kAthakE*** ********laugAkshi********
******* ********sutrE******** * *****caraka***** ***grihya***
********sutra********  
***2) ***********sa-mantraka******** *************************
**************kAthakE***************
*****************laugAkshi********************
*****************************
********************sutrE******************** ***cArAnIya ***grihya
sutra******

Among three commentaries ( one bhAshya , two paddhati) two are of
***sa-mantraka*** ** *****caraka***** ** ********grihyasutra******** ,
and one of ***sa-mantraka-cArAnIya ***grihyasutra*** .***  
The earliest explanatory work is a brief ***vivararan*** by
***Adityadarsana*** ,in which each sutra is explained separately.
***brahmanabala*** wrote a ***pancika***, a detailed treatise of the
***paddhati*** style, containing ritual rules and regulations and
supplementing the sutra text with additional instructions. Quoting for
each chapter first the complete sutra text and subjoining the mantras to
his own observations.( these two belongs to ***sa-mantraka*** **
*****caraka***** ** ********grihyasutra******** ,)

There is, in the third place, a commentary ***bhAshya*** on the sutras
and indicated as well as full mantras ( ***mantrapratika ,sakal
pAtha*** )by ***devapAla***,he commented on a different version i.e.
***“sa-mantraka-cArAnIya ***grihyasutra*** ”*** in which the sutra text
is often preserved but elsewhere replaced by the commentary. Moreover,
there are very useful so-called ***richakas*** .

![Colophon from devapAla's
commentary](https://animeshnagarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-img_20140926_202633.jpg?w=700 "IMG_20140926_202633.JPG")

****kAthak mantra pAtha****

***kAthak mantra pAtha*** is collection of mantra which are indicated as
***mantrapratika*** in grihya sutra and aren’t found in ***kAthaka
samhitA*** .These some times also known as **kAthaka mantrAdhyaya** is
additional section found onlyin commented version by ***devapAla***
of this grihya sutra. i.e. in **sa-mantraka-cArAnIya**
***grihyasutra*** **.**  
The major possibility is that, this mantras are either from
***cArAnIya*** ***shAkhA or kalapajA*** ***richaks*** ( mantras of
ritualistic origin ) . Some of this mantras are accented ( only with
uddAta which is only svara marked in kAthak samhitA , marked as a bar
on top of ***akshara*** ) and other are not .There are 8 parts of this  
**kAthaka mantrAdhyaya** .

***1st part*** contains a single  
mantra without accent , this mantra is not traced in any vedic samhita .

***2nd Part*** consist of ***jayAdi mantra*** , it is clear that this
mantras are not found in kAthak samhita so they are collected in this
section .

***3rd Part*** consists of ***Adhipatya mantra*** commonly known as
AbhyAtan mantra in yajur vedic tradition.

***4th part*** consist of ***sarasvatyanuvAka*** consisting of 21
accented mantras.( they are also not traced anywhere ) devapAla applies
this mantras in ***vivAha samsakAra .***

**5th Part** consists of 5 mantras related to ***agnimukham***.  
Last mantra’s half part is traced in ***kAthak samhita.***

***6th Part*** consists of 8 mantras known as ***kapota sukta*** in
***kAthak*** tradition .

***7th Part*** is longest part consisting of two ***anuvAka*** related
to ***srAddha*** ceremony .  
Some mantras in this section are from ***kAthak samhita.***

***8th Part*** consists of 8 mantras known as ***adabhuda shAnti
sukta.***

This ***mantraprashna*** has collection of mantras which aren’t
connected to each other( ***prakrana pathita mantrA*** ), so it is also
a possibility that this is a small fragment of ***kAthaka mantra
pAtha*** preserved in ***devapAla’s*** commentary . Possibly the
original one was quite brief than that of our text. Few accented mantras
show that this treaties like that of ***Apastamba*** was accented and
possess important place in ***kAthak grihya tradition***.  
Even till the date Kashmiri brAmhans followes this sutra and perform
rituals on behalf of the kAkhaka grihya sutra .
