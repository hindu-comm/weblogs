svara marking of paippalAda samhitA

It is commonly misunderstood that ***paippalAda shAkhA*** of *atharvan
veda* lacks **vedic savars.** In actuality about 70 percent of
***paippalAda samhitA*** had lost it’s ***svara*** yet 30 percent part
preserves orignal ***svara*** .{ I am not including the part which is
either found in ***saunaka samhitA*** or in any other ***vedic
samhitA*** , if we accounts this we can restore about 40- 45 percent
part with ***svara*** of **paippalAda samhitA .Orissan version ( utkala
pAtha ) of paippalAda samhita lacks svaras about completely, it’s
kashmira version( kashmira pAtha ) where we get orignal svaras of
paippalAda shAkhA.** }  
Svara marking of ***paippalAda*** ***samhitA*** is unique in it’s way
.  
***paippalAda samhitA*** **** possesses ***4 svaras*.**  
**1) udAtta**  
**2) anudAtta**  
**3) svarita**  
**4) jAtya svarita**

**1) udAtta:-**  
This is the natural or inherent accent in a word. Traditionally it is
rendered as middle pitch. ***udAtta*** may be signaled especially
inatharvan traditions by raising the hand. In ***paippalAda samhitA***
it is marked as line above the letter.( upper vertical bar )

***2) anudAtta :-***  
It is rendered in low pitch. In paippalAda samhitA it is indicated by
line below the letter. ( lower vertical bar )

***3) svarita :-***  
It is rendered in high pitch on short vowel. In atharvan tradition long
vowel svarita-s are rendered as an elongation or duplication in an
elevated pitch. In ***paippalAda samhitA***  
it is marked as a dot below the letter.

***4) jAtya svarita***  
It is denoted by a symbol of right below the letter. It is recited like
any other svarita depending on whether a short or long generated by the
sandhi.

A mantra with orignal svaras from paippalAda samhita ( PS 1.22.1 ) is
given below.

The same mantra in ***saunaka*** ***samhitA*** ( AV 1.31.1) is

Since ***orissan version*** of ***paippalAda samhita*** lacks the
***svaras*** so the reciters from ***orissA*** chant the ***paipalAda
samhitA*** in ***ekashrutI*** ***svara*** i.e. in single pitch mode of
recital.Vedic lineage of Kashmir got distorted ,so not a single reciter
is there in Kashmir of paippalAda shAkhA  
but a portion with ***savars*** is available in Kashmir version of it.
The Vedic texts studied in Kashmir at the time are known from the
quotations contained in ***jayanta Bhatta’s Nyåyamañjari*** They include
texts from all the four Vedas. The ***atharvan veda*** was very well
known at the time, not in ***shaunak*** form but in the ***paippalAda**
form* ,apparently it still was recited with ***svaras*** at that time.
Some of its later texts were also studied, and the ***atharvavedins***
were proud to have a special initiation; only someone having undergone
it, was allowed to study their texts.
