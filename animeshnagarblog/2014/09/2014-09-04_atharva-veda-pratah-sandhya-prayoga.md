atharva veda prAtaH sandhyA prayoga

The foundation of **Braahman**, the essence of being a **Braahman**, is
**Sandhyaavandanam.** All **Braahmanans** not only must need to wear the
sacred thread (***yagnopavitam***) but also observe the appropriate
rites of SandhyAvandanaM . ***Sandhya prayoga for atharva veda is based
on sandhyA parishisthA***. Yet there are slight variations in actual
practice. In the end I have given the *prayoga , first instructions are
described*.( I have marked numbers in prayoga and instruction.)  
In the general topic of atharva  
Sandhyaavandanam the following are included:  
*1) AchamanaM*  
*2) mArjanaM*  
*3) prAnAyAm*  
*4) jala prAshanaM*  
*5) arghya dAnaM*  
*6) surya upasthAnaM*  
*7) gAyatri japaM*  
*8) prArthana*  
*9) sAvithrI visarjanaM*  
*10) sAvithrI upasthAnaM*

***Some genral codes to be followed:***

1\) The hair must be styled into a lock (Sikha) . Those without long
hair must ensure that a few strands of hair must be twisted together to
replicate a lock of hair.  
2) Clothing should either be a loin cloth or the “dhothi” trussed up in
traditional braahminical fashion.  
3) Hands and feet should be duly washed.  
4) One must face the east or north or optionally any body of (fresh)
water.  
5) When at a body of water like a pool or lake, observe the following
posture: Squat with one foot in the water and the other ashore; bring
your arms between the two knees; dip your left hand in the water (if at
a faucet, hold the left hand under it) and perform the AchamanaM with
the right hand.

******1)***** **AachamanaM***

By Aachamanam it is intended the cleansing of the indriyams, loosely
translatable as “sense organs”. Sit in squatting position ( if you are
doing it on land rather than in water body )take few drops of water in
your right palm and ingest it three times. Finally, touch the heart by
reciting following mantra.  
This makes one AchamanaM. To complete the ritual, repeat the whole
process all over again. Wherever it says “wash your feet and do
AchamanaM” remember that the ritual is complete only with the
duplication.

***2) mArjanaM***

Aachamanam is followed by mArjanaM which is internal cleansing with
Manthrams and dedication. there are three Manthrams to be recited, Take
water in your hand and after reciting each Manthram, sprinkle the water
on your head .With pada ***yasya kshayaaya jinwattha*** sprinkle water
on Big Toes .

****3) prAnAyAm****

Close the left nostril with ring finger of right hand and exhale from
right nostril slowly. Close the right nostril with thumb of right hand
. Now, open the left nostril and inhale slowly. a. While inhaling,
recite mentally the following Mantra: Afterwards, close the left
nostril also as before, so that air is held inside the body. Holding
breath, recite mentally the Mantra, Close the left nostril with ring
finger of right hand and exhale from right nostril slowly. While
exhaling, recite mentally the mantra. The thumb and first finger of the
left hand should be in contact with the left hand palm facing
skywards.Do the above thrice.

***4) jala prAshanaM***

jala prAshanaM is recommended after performance of***AachamanaM and
mArjanaM*** . It is ordained as a penitence ritual for any sinful acts
one may have committed, in thought or deed, knowingly or unknowingly.
While in our tradition we perform it routinely, it does not appear in
vidhi described by ***sandhyA parishishthA.*** It may be a later
addition in *mula vidhi* due to ***yajurvedic influences .***  
Sit down in squatting position. Take water in the right hand crooked to
hold it, recite the Manthram and ingest the water as one would a Brahma
thIrtham. It is important to keep the thumb turned away from the palm
not touching the index finger.

***5) arghya dAnaM***

arghyadaanaM is propitiation of the Sun God. Perform ***arghyadAnaM***
four times with the sun ahead of you.( 4 times ***arghyadana*** is
peculiar to atharvan tradition) Face east at dawn and midday, and west
at dusk.  
Stand erect holding tumbler in the left hand between thumb and first
finger. Hold both palms together, separating the thumb of the right
hand from rest of fingers. Take water in both palms – holding palms at
the level of the face. Recite mantra verbally with sound waves emanating
from the mouth; throw the water up in the air, looking at the sun, while
doing so the heels of both legs should be raised.( in morning ). That is
arghyam is offered standing on toes.  
In case of prayachhita arghya offer another arghya i.e. 5 th one by the
same mantra for atonement due to any delay.

***6) surya upasthAnaM***

Stand facing the sun with anjali mudra (Namaste posture). Recite the
mantrams.

***7) gAyatri japaM***

Before commencing **gayatri japam** some preliminaries such **gayatri
aavahanam** should be completed.For **pratah** and **madhyanika** it is
done standing, while for sayam it is done sitting. The japam is done
8,10, 28, 32, 108 or 1008 times.The counting is done in fingers, with
thumb moving to different positions to indicate the number. By using
right hand for units and left hand for tens we can count upto 100.The
hands for counting should be covered by the upper garment.The hands are
held at neck level for pratah, chest level for madhyanika and navel
level for sayam.

***8) prArthana***

Recite the mantras in namaskaram mudra.

***9) sAvithrI visarjanaM***

Perform the udvaasana mudra with the palms stand up and hold the palms
in praNaama/namaste posture and recite the mantras.

***10) sAvithrI upasthAnaM***

Recite the mantras in standing position with *namaskara* mudra.  
With last mantra do samarpan to bramhan the all mighty.

***AbhivAdan*** :

It is also not mentioned in the parishishtA but it is in tradition to
perform it. The palms of the hands are kept near ears, the body is bent
at waist level and Abhivadanam is recited.  
***abhivAdaye (..your pravara rishi’s name…{e.g.
svayambhu}……){+optionally ( ……..) (………) thrayarsheya or pancharsheya
pravarAnvita} (..gothra… {e.g. vaitAyana}…..) (..suthra … {e.g.
kaushika-vaitAna suthra}….) (..your veda’s name …… {e.g.atharvan veda
saunaka }……) shaakhaa adhyaayI shrI (…..{e.g. animesh }………)
sharmAnAmAhaM asmibhoH \|\|***

After completing the recitation, the right forehand crosses above the
left forehand, and touch the feet of elders. By this an individual
expresses his descent namely dynastic ***rishis, gotra, sutra, veda,
shAkha and name.***
