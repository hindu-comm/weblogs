Upakarma -1

Hear I am giving a step by step procedure for atharva veda.Upakarma
prayog for othere 3 veda will be published after.  
Upakarma (/upaakarma/) means beginning or “Arambham”, i.e. to begin the
study of the your shakha belonging to your own Veda (Veda
Adhyayanam).Atharva Upakarma means to begin the study of the Atharvan
Veda. Upakarma, means “Beginning” and it is historically, the day was
considered auspicious for beginning the Vedic studies. O this day one
has to start study of Vedas after doing samarpana of what he has studied
in the earlier years. Hear I am describing it with some specific
points  
 (1) Importance :  
To expiate the sins of wrong intonation, lack of devotion during the
chanting of mantras & not being seated properly during the chanting of
mantra, this upakarma is performed.The mantras lose their potency &
do not fetch any merit if upakarma is not performed. Itis a compulsory
ritual. All brahmins must perform this ritual . In atharvan
upakarma, gratitude is offered to Atharvan and Angiras clans ,to whom
Atharva-Vedic mantras were revealed & to the devathas who are the
abhimanidevathas of those mantras. Then the yajnopavita is worn. We can
call it annual atonement for misconducts.  
  
 (2) Timing and thithi :

Atharvan upakarma is performed on Shravan Sukla Purnima ( Purnima
should be udayavayapini thithi ) in Sravan nakshatra.  
Some bramhanas ( from Maharashtra & Gujrat ) perform upakarma on
Abhijita nakshtra in sravan month.  
Due to some reason if you are unable to perform upakarma on shravan
purnima you may perform it on Ashadha/ Bhadrapada purnima .  
Only for those who are having Soothaka or Vrudhi during the said period,
they need not do Upakarma on that day. However, after the soothaka or
vrudhi is completed,they must do the Upakarma homa and have the
yagnopaveetha changed.

 (3) Kamokarshita japam :

Kamokarshita japam is performed as an atonement for not performing
Utsarjan ( discontinuing study of samhita and bramhana portion )
ceremony on Paushya purnima. The mantra for the kAmo’kArshIt japam is
“kAmo’kArshIt………and manyur akArshIt”…….. .Some people also change their
yajnopavItam before the kAmo’kArshIt japam, in addition to the changing
done for upAkarma itself. It should be remembered that the changing
before upAkarma is the more important one, and if one only wants to
change once, the upAkarma changing is preferred. The utsarjana has
unfortunately fallen into disuse for quite a while, so what remains is
the meager prAyaScittam for not having done it. Therefore, the
important yajnopavItam changing is for the upAkarma.

Pujya Chandrashekhrendra saraswati mahaswamingal known as Paramacharya,
Mahaswami or Maha Periyavaal wrote in “Hindu dharma”  
-“Today we perform upakarma as a one-day ceremony without keeping up the
study of the Vedas. We do not go through the utsarjana at all. For our
failure to do it we mutter a mantra in expiation, the mantra called
“Kamokarsit”which says, “I did not sin. Kama (desire) did it. Anger did
it. . . “There is no need to repeat this mantra if we perform the
utsarjana. Everybody must learn his own Veda \[the Veda that is his by
birth\] and other subjects in addition. When we perform upakarma we must
start learning a new part of the Vedas. Later, at the time of utsarjana,
it must be discontinued and the study of the Vedangas taken up. The
Vedas, to repeat, must be studied during the six months roughly of
Daksinayana, from the south of Sravana to Taisya. The next six months
must be devoted to the Vedangas. ”

\(4\) Samidha adhanam:

 Samidhaadhanam is a part of daily conduct of a bramhachari. Today yet
it is not irrelevent but rarely bramhacharis perform it on ragular
basis. Kaushika sutra mentions proper atonement for it and vicchinagni
sandhan for a bramhachari.

\(5\) Bramhachari prayachitta :  
Gopatha- bramhana mentions several sins that a bramhachari may have,
and gives prayachhita for them. In todays life style possibility of
these sins are more , so a bramhachari should perform atonement to get
out of the sins.

 (6)Upakarma prayoga :

In upakarama prayog gana snana ( ritualistic bath ) , yagyopavita
dharan ( changing yagyopavita in which old is discarded and a new
yagyopavita is put on ) , anuvaka rishi tarpan ( offering of gratitude
to rishis ) , upakarma homa and veda- arambha is performed .  
It is often erroneously thought that upAkarma is primarily the changing
the yajnopavItam . This cannot be further from the truth. Changing the
poonool happens very often, whenever a significant vedic karma is
performed. UpAkarma, however, is a rededication of oneself to the study
of one’s Veda, along with salutations to the rishis who perceived and
revealed the Vedic mantras to the world. This is the significance of the
angirasadi anuvaka tarpaNam and the anuvAka recitation.

\(7\) Gayatri homam/ japam :

Better is let me qoute maha periyavaal “If a brahmacarin makes any
mistake in chanting the Vedas, in matter of tone or enunciation, he must
do penance for the same on upakarma day. On this occasion he eats no
more than a few sesame seeds; otherwise he fasts the whole day; and on
the following day he offers 1,008 sticks of the palasa in the sacred
fire chanting the Gayatri. He should do this every year. Nowadays
brahmacarins perform this rite only on the day following the first
upakarma following the upanayana. Actually this a rite all Brahmins are
expected to perform, though we find today householders doing only
Gayatri-japa. When you merely mutter the mantra you feel sleepy and you
may go wrong in the japa. But such will not be the case if you also
perform a homa as you chant the Gayatri. Sticks offered in the fire must
be those of palasa, if not of the asvattha; darbha grass may be used if
the other two are not available.”

\(8\) Fasting on upakarma day:

On the UpAkarma day, strictly speaking, the rule is to eat only after
upakarma . If done properly this lasts well into the afternoon. Because
of the length of the procedure, young brahmacharis and those others who
are absolutely unable to bear their hunger are permitted to eat before
the homam itself. The typical meal consists of phalaharam. Complete
fasting is observed after this through the night, in preparation for
the next day’s gAyatrI japam/homam In some traditions one meal is eaten
during the day and phalAhAram is observed at night.
