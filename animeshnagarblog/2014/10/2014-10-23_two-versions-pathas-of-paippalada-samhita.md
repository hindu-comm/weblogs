Two versions (pAthas) of paippalAda samhitA

paippalAda shAkhA is one of two surviving ***atharvan shAkhAs.***Until
relatively recently the ***paippalAda*** material was believed by the
scholarly world( I’m speaking about westerners as well as Indian
scholars who works in western way ) to have survived only in corrupted
***kashmiri version***( which I call ***kashmir pAtha*** of paippalAda
samhitA rather than corrupt due to local pronunciation ) , During the
1960’s, however, a vastly superior Orissa manuscript tradition as well
as living tradition was brought to the attention of the academic
community by ***D.*** ***Bhattacharyya***, who later published orissan
paippalAda samhitA.( which I call ***utkala pAtha*** of paippalAda
samhitA)  
I personally believe that ,this two are two distinct versions( two
samhitA ) of paippalAda shAkhA rather than two incomplete,peculiar and
corrupt version of same samhitA .Even same is true about **kAnva
samhitA** of **shukla yajur veda** which has a **orissan version** with
41 chapters and a **Arsha** version with 40 chapters ,which is more
famous. Tradition holds the information that even ***taittarIya***
samhitA had two versions namely ***sAraswata pAtha*** and ***Arsha
pAtha*** .  
Even ***kAndAnukramAnI*** mentions of ***sAraswata pAtha*** .Yet the
pAtha in both versions are same , but the textual arrangement is
different.  
Verses in ***sAraswata pAtha*** (सारस्वतपाठः) are numbered as
\[A.B.C.D.E\] standing for \[भागः\].\[काण्डः\].
\[विषयः\].\[अनुवाकः\].\[पञ्चादि \]  
A sequence no. of TS\[1.1.2.3.4\] refers to \[भागः = सम्हिता\]. \[काण्डः
= 1\].\[प्रश्नः = 2\].\[अनुवाकः = 3\].\[पञ्चादि = 4\]  
Verses in ***Arsheya pAtha*** (आर्षेयपाठः) are numbered as \[A.B.C.D\]
standing for \[काण्डः\]. \[विषयः\].\[अनुवाकः\].\[पञ्चादि \]  
A sequence no. of TS\[1.2.3.4\] refers to \[काण्डः =
प्राजापत्य-काण्डम्\]. \[विषयः = याजमानम्\].\[अनुवाकः = 3\].\[पञ्चादि =
4\]

Some proofs in support of my view of two ***pAthas*** of ***paippalAda
shAkhA*** are

1\) For instance in kashmiri pronunciation –***v***– cannot be
pronounced at the beginning of a word, thus we find ***rAtUm*** as
**kashmiri pAtha** and ***vrataM*** as ***Orissan pAtha.*** One example
may suffice to show the pervasive influence of local pronunciation has
had on the transmission of the ***paippalAda shAkhA.***

2) Another example is ***Kashmir pAtha*** : ***yixe torze taa…..; atha
kuxmaanDe zoyaat yo opotyau manyeta..*** = orissan pAtha : **ishe tvorje
tvaa…; atha kushmaNDair juhuyaat yo ‘puta iva manyeta.**  
Some typical peculiarities of Kashmiri pronunciation are easily seen
from the above example: ***x\~sh, Cva\~Cu, z\~j, o\~u,*** etc. ***The
above example does not fail to stress that the written manuscript
itself rest on recitation, whether directly or indirectly.***

3\) ***karmapanjikA*** which quotes ***mantrAs*** *from* ***orissan***
***pAtha*** of paippalAda samhita have different ***rishi / chhanda /
devtA*** for mantras than that of ***kashmira pAtha*** .

4\) There are various **pAtha bheda** ( difference in ***shabda*** /
pada/ ,half richAs, ) in two versions.

5\) Total no of ***suktas*** as well as mantras varies in two versions.

6\) Some mantras found in ***utkala pAtha*** are not in ***kashmira
pAtha*** and vice versa is also true.

7\) The internal arrangement within ***kAnda*** in the ***orissan
version*** is quite peculiar. Each ***kAnda*** is composed of hymns
which in ***kashmira version*** are found in their entirety but in
orissan version are divided into two hymns of 10 +x.  
To clarify, ***kashmira version*** PS 13.12 = ***orissan version*** PS
13.1 (10 verses) + kashmira 13.2 (6 verses). What emerges from a no so
close examination of ***kAndas*** is that the text arrangement of the
two traditions seems to be different at the most basic level, the
***sukta*** level.

8\) ***Kashmira*** version have partial ***svara*** ( you may refer to
my previous post “***svara marking of paippalAda samhitA “***
<http://wp.me/p4M2ms-5E> )  
and orissan version had lost it’s svara .  
The accents of orissan version were lost already in ***srIdhara’s***
time ( author of ***karmapanjikA).*** In chapter 3 ***( tritIya
adhyAya )*** of the ***karmapanjikA*** he himself admits this fact with
the words **** ****“idAnIṃ tadavyavahArAt asya mantrasya svarA na
nirnIyante.”****  
***“The accents of this mantra cannot be ascertained because of their
having gone out of practice.”***

9\) ***Orissan*** ***paippalAda*** always have –***ch***-, on the same
place ***kashmira paippalAda*** have  
–***śch***– in the mantras.

10\) Another difference between the Orissa and Kashmir ***paippalAda***
lies in the fact that the ***Orissa pAtha*** use only ***visarga***
before velar and labial voiceless stops in external ***sandhi***, while
the ***Kashmir pAtha*** follows the typically Kashmiri habit of using
***jihvAmUlIya*** and ***upadhmAnIya*** .

11\) A sign for avagraha (’) is frequently but not reliably used in the
***or******issan pAtha*** and never in the ***kashmir pAtha***.

12\) Oriya script does not distinguish between ***-b-*** and ***-v-***
( When quoting readings from ***Orissan pAtha***, one may thus choose
the appropriate phoneme. The Orissa pAtha cannot be used as evidence for
establishing the spelling, with ***-b-***or ***–**v-***, of rare words
with uncertain etymology .

13\) the Oriya vowel sign ***-ri-*** is pronounced ***/ru/***. Hence,
the sound ***/ru/*** is mostly written either with the initial - sign
in words like ***va-//ri//-n*** (= –***varuna***-), or with the
postconsonantal sign in ******cak-//ri //-r (= cakrur).******

14\) There are additional differences of sandhi-treatment between the
Kashmir and Orissa transmissions but they need not be detailed in the
present discussion of peculiarities.

15\) Especially this last point is important: while e.g. at ***PS***
***19.1.10 a*** the Kashmir pAtha, indeed writes ***Ileagniṃ*** (and
thus seems to preserve a possibly old Vedic allophony,) the Orissa
pAtha read ***IrE agniṃ***(not ***Il******E*** or ***Id******E*** ! ),
thus introducing the allophony of the Oriya language (intervocalic
voiced retroflex stop becomes f lap) into the orthography for Vedic
language. There is no letter in kashmiri \[languageor script?\]
possessing the sound of the ***-rre-*** or ***-R-***. Since the sign
was probably used only in writing Vedic texts, to render the sign that
Vedic scholars are accustomed to transliterate as ***-l-***,prefer to
retain this interpretation rather than ***-d-***.

This all evidences are sufficient to prove that ***orissan paippalAda
samhitA*** and ***kashmira paippalAda samhitA*** are two different
versions ( better to call ***upa-shAkhA*** )of ***paippalAda shAkhA.***

Even some scholars are trying to reconstruct **paippalAda samhitA i**n
archetype on the basis of these two version , two tradition and two way
of transmission , but they don’t know about the entity
***“*****shAkhA-bedha “.**Better to end with following ***“shloka
“******:-***

***” yasya rAgyo janpade atharvA shAnti pAragaH \| nivasatyapi
tadrAshtraM vardhate nirupadravaM \|\| “***

The king in whose state resides a ****atharvavedin**** “the *knower of
shAnti* ” grows without difficulties.
