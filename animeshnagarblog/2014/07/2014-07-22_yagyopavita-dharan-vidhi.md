|| Yagyopavita Dharan vidhi ||

Hear I am giving another vidhi for yagyopavita dharan which is most
commanly used by all bramhans irrespective of there sects, shakhas.  
I have confirmed that Paipaladins also uses this vidhi . The process
given above is authentic and std. for shaunak shakha.  
I have seen some shaunka- shakhadhyayins using this vidhi due to lack of
living tradition,paddhati granta, corruption in texts , not maintaining
family tradition and lack of interest in atharva vediya karmas.  
Bramhans belonging to atharva veda are studying othere shakhas ,due to
opportunity of income as they are majorly followed.Some paipaladins from
Orrisa are learning Kanva shakha , Shaunkins from Gujrat are learning
Shukla yajurveda, In south, some are learning Taittariya shakha instead
of there own shakha ( Shaunak & Paipalada Atharva veda)  
This vidhi is comman to all vedic bramhans , hence I am giving this.)  
Perform Achmanam twice and pranayam thrice.  
Perform samkalpam, then recite the following mantra for wearing
yagnopavit.Visarjan mantra for old yagyopavita is same.

***yaGYopavIta dhArnaNa mantrasya prajApati R^ishiH,
triShTupChandaH,***  
***trayIvidyA devatA\|***  
***yaGYopavIta dhAraNe viniyogaH\|***

***yaGYopavItaM paramaM pavitraM prajApateH yatsahajaM purastAt.h
\|***  
***AyushyamagryaM pratimu\~ncha shubhraM yaGYopavItaM balamastu tejaH
\|\|***

Discard old yagyopavita by following mantra

**upavItam ChinnantuM jIrNam kashmala-dUshitaM \|**  
**visRjAmi punarbrahman.h varco dIrghAyurastu me \|\|**

Perform Achmanam, do samarpanam.

**Note : grahasta should again perform the above procedure for second
yagyopavita. Add the samkalpam lines as** *mama grahasta-AshramArthE
dwitIyA yagyopavIta dhAran karIshyE.)*
