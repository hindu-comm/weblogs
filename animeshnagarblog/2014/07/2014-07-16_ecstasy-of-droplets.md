Ecstasy of droplets

My heart glad ,when it rains  
Winds of ecstasy,Blows in thy world.  
With bliss and joy for me  
Thou,remover of my pain…..

Tiny droplets dancing in bliss,  
Showing your grace to world.  
Oh rain!Remover of sufferings,  
Be always in my heart ,it is my wish…..

Sound of yours is too devine,  
Like voice of god in a silent manner.  
Ultimate bliss to earth oh!rain  
Showing love of him for mine…..
