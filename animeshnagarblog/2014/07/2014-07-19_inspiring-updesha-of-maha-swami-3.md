Inspiring updesha of Maha Swami

Maha periyavaal jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhrendra Saraswati needs no
introduction .His introduction is like *showing lamp to sun*, pouring
water droplets into sea.  
Hear I am giving his view on education. Personally it is inspiring for
me and seems to be inspiring and guiding for humankind.

” ****Right education should make us know that God is the Truth.
Knowledge must fill one with good qualities, through which one can
realise the Truth, that is God. Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the
understanding of the Ultimate Truth. The first fruit of education must
be humility and self control.”****
