Rules for Bramhacharins

Rules in general, many more strictly supervised strictures are imposed
on the Brahmachaaris, many of which may sound rather amusing for the
present generation.  
\* After Veda studies till noon, perform” ***Upastthaanam*** “, carry
“***Danda***” and go for “***Bhiksha***” (food got through begging).  
\* “***Bhiksha***” (such food) may be consumed with the permission of
the “***Guru***“.  
\* Eat only out of plantain leaf – end or split piece, but not a middle
piece.  
\* The left hand (fingers) should be touching the leaf throughout the
period –  
\* Must not remove the hand even for drinking water, which can be
poured into the mouth by someone.  
\* Taboo : horse gram, Urad dhal, onion, asafoetida, red chillies,
moringa-leaf curry, coconut oil, jaggery-milk mix, pop-rice kept in
copper vessel, fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), honey, “***Paanakam***” with
dried ginger, sugarcane juice, “***Pappadam***“, etc.  
\* Avoid everything that has “***Asuddhi***” (pollution).  
\* Do not talk while eating; if one must, then speak only in Sanskrit.  
\* Should not sleep during the day. If slept accidentally, take bath
before “***Sandhyaavandanam***” and dinner.  
\* No diving into the pond.  
\* Don’t climb trees or on elephants. In other words, stay on the ground
only.  
\* Do not wear long cloth / ***“Dhothi” / “veshthi***“.  
\* Do not cross the “***Desam***” without “***Danda***” and
***kaupina*** (“Thorth”).  
\* The tuft of hair ( ***shikha*** )must be twisted and knotted.  
\* Smear forehead, etc. with ash.(***tripundra dharan***)  
\* No ornaments are to be worn.  
\* Do not chew pan, nor smoke.  
\* No make-up (“***Alankaarams***“).  
\* Do not look into the mirror.  
\* Do not use eye-liner / mascara.  
\* Do not utter bad words nor scold others.  
\* Should not look at the sun, other than during rituals like
“***Upastthaanam***“, wearing new sacred thread, etc.  
\* Do not bed with others.  
\* Do not look at animals and insects when they are mating; avoid them
as enemies.  
\* Do not keep chatting with women.  
\* No dancing, no singing.  
Do not make noise nor drum with finger nails.  
\* Do not hang around lazily.  
\* Do not tell lies.  
\* Do not hurt animals.  
\* Avoid anything that the “***Aachaarya***” declares as not good.  
\* Except on holidays (***anadhyaya*** ) and local temple festivals,
recite the “***Vedam***“.  
\* Masturbation corrupts “***Brahmacharyam***“.  
\* It is during this “***Brahmacharyam***” that ***Veda*** learning is
pursued; ****Veda is the basis for all the good that Braahmanans
acquire.****
