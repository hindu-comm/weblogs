|| Vamsa for Atharvaveda ||

Vamsa is nothing but lineage of acharyas. Mostly this vamsa is lineage
of rishis getting the upadesha ( teaching about parabramha or on any
subject ) from some other rishis . In most of vamasas lineage of
bramhavidya is mentioned ( yet shatpatha bramhana gives vamsa for
yagniki vidya )  
Another important point is that all lineages start from bramha ( some
times he is also called svayabhu bramha , sometimes prajapati, )  
Like all other traditions of Rigvedis (shankhayan) ,Suklayajurvedis
having vamsa starting from svayambhu bramha,Krishna yajurvedis
,Samavedis having a bramhana dedicated to vamsa ( Vamsa bramhana )
.Atharvans have there vamsa too. These vamsa is mentioned in Mundaka
upanishad.

Starting from Bramha to shaunak maharshi, acharyas mentioned in vamsa
are enlisted below :

\(1\) Bramha ( viswasya karta bhuvanasya gopta )

\(2\) Atharva ( Eldest son of Bramha )  
(3)Angir

\(4\) Satyavaha bharadwaja  
(5) Angirasa

\(6\) Shaunak  
( shaunak mahashal )

This is lineage of seekers and seers of bramhavidya in accordance with
atharvan tradition. Like all other traditions of north India ( mostly of
shukla yajurvedis ), oblations are offered to all this acharyas by
Atharvans on upakarma day.
