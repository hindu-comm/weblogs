Atharvan Yagyopavit Dharan Vidhi

The procedure for yagyopavita dharan in accordance with Kaushika sutra
\[ Grihyasutra of Atharva veda \] is quite different from all other
traditions , Somewhat it is parallel to procedure followed by Ashvalayan
rigavedi nambothiris, Jaimineya samavedi nambothris .  
Other Rigvedi , Yajur vedi ( both krishna & sukla ), Samavedi and
Paipalada atharvavedis uses ****yagyopavitam paramam…….**** this mantra
for wearing bramhasutra , whether it is mentioned in there Grihyasutra
sutra or not . Even brahmans following ashwalayan sutra ( mostly
Maharashtrin brahmans ), Jaiminyeya brahmans ( belonging to Varanasi )
uses same mantra even if it is not mentioned in there sutra. Only
Nambothiri and some other traditions preserve original, authentic and
standard procedure for wearing yagyopavita for the bramhans following
such grihya-sutras where no mantra is prescribed for wearing
yagnopavita.  
\* The most common procedure among all sects of brahmans as well as in
both north Indian & south Indian tradition is to wear yagnopavit by
use of mantra ****Yagyopavitam parmam pavitraaam . ..****……It seems to
be that this mantra is common to all brahmans.  
The procedure given below is followed by my family tradition ,( recently
I have confirmed procedure used by us and described by Darila bhashya on
kaushika sutra.) .A parallel procedure is used by nambothiris of
ashvalayan , jaimineya, vadhula sects, please refer to nambothiri
website of Callicut trust.(url = <http://www.nambothiri.com>)

note-Procedure may differ according to sect, family tradition ,
guru-parampara, ( please refer to your elders / purohita / guru )
