Series of Emotion

My heart possesses emotions,  
feelings that are left unsaid.  
The person of love is faraway and I have to wait,

Glittering eyes full with love,heart beating with ballot of olds.  
Lips waiting for wine of love, awaiting her hands to be hold,

Breathing more deeper love,  
Endless time with series of emotion,  
Thou oh my sweet beloved , I have feeling ” My love is my devotion.”

To be with her is my religion  
dear beloved you are my devine ,  
Love is my nationality, emotions and feelings are race of mine.

Do you know ? how am I awaiting for little bit voice of yours.  
charming face and love for mine. I’m missing you with eyes full of
tears.
