Atharvan tvarita rudra mantra

These mantras are house in *Atharvavediya-Mahanarayan* upnishad .It is
in tradition to recite these mantras for rapid wish fulfilling.Even
shaiva agama mentions about it ( please refer to **Vatul-Agam )**.Since
they belongs to atharvan tradition so rishi assigned for these mantras
are **Atharvan or Atharva .** It is clear from mantras that deity for
these mantras is Tvarita-Rudra.  
( A parallel anuvaka with difference in mantras, rishi is there in
Taittariya aranyak (10 chapter famously known as Narayanvalli or
mahanarayan upnishad ).Famous commenter Sayan in his bhasya describes
this mantra as tvarita rudranuvaka)
