jaiminIya sAmaveda rUdraM

The Primacy of sAmavedaM is in UpAsana through the singing of hymns .
The science of music is said to have evolved from this vedaM , gandharva
vedaM is a subsidiary of sAmavedaM ,  
as with other vedaMs, sAmavedaM originally had numerous branches, but
only three exist now ( jaiminIya shAkhA, rAyayaNIya shAkhA , kauThuma
shAkhA ). The jaiminIya shAkhA been traditionally chiefly practiced in
the states of tamiZh deshaM and kerala deshaM .  
sAmaMs are made by modifying riks using the same words, changed,
repeated, deleted, or letters and words added, all according to strict
rules, with no provision for improvisations. The musical chanting has
come down through the ages from Acharya ( gurU ) to shishya by word of
mouth. The jaiminIya shAkhA is the most musical of the three existing
branches. While other vedaMs use three notes (swaraMs) sAmaM is sung
using seven notes (prathhama, etc.). jaiminIya shAkhA uses syllables
consisting of regular vowels and consonants for its svara marking ,
svara marking is limited to the gAna part of the jaiminIya shAkhA . The
svara marking of the jaiminIya shAkhA is a different matter entirely
and has not been studied and analysed yet . Following is rUdraM of
jaiminIya shAkhA consisting of 11 sAmaMs.
