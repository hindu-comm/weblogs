Yantras , gurUkrama , mantras, and several prayogas of ***Atharvan
dhUmAvatI*** are described in mahAtharvan samhitA but unfortunately text
is lost only mantroddhAra and yantroddhAra of atharvan dhUmAvatI are
preserved in my tradition. ***kAkarUdha dhUmAvatI*** is described as
sitting on crow and ***raTharUdha dhUmAvatI*** is described as sitting
on old and damaged chariot mulamantra is same in both cases but dhyAnas
differ.
