laghu rUdra sukta of kAThaka yajurvedins

The land which once was enchanted with mantras of four vedas ( *rigveda
shAkal ,yajurveda kAthaka ,sAmaveda kauThuma* and *atharvaveda
paippalAda shAkhA* ), 84 *Agamas* and many *sAkta* tantras is barren
from sound of namakaM and chamakaM.Ancestors of present kashmIrI
pandits were chaturvedIs, with time only largest following shAkhA( i.e.
kAthaka shAkhA with laugAkshI sutra ) remain preserved.Due to decline in
tradition all groups of *kashmIrI brAhman* adopted it . As for as my
knowledge one of such group have *bhava-kapishThala gotra* and they are
originally follower of *kapishThala shAkhA* but lately adopted *kaThaka
shAkhA .Today* land of *kashmIra* lacks even a single samhitA pAthI of
kaThaka shAkhA *.*Due to practical use only rituals and ritual manuals
of kaThaka shAkhA remain preserved .Unfortunately due scarcity of time,
sake of bred and butter , malecchAs and lost interest thisrituals and
ritual manuals ( prayoga pustakas ) are also dying . *As told to me by
an old kashmIrI priest on telephonic conversation* ” from last 150 years
rituals and ritual manuals are continuously getting shortened , Those
manual that we were taught was about 90-100 pages and our forefather’s
handwritten manuscripts were about 150-200 pages ,different ritualas
take 4-5 hours. Now rituals manuals are shortened to 30-45 pages and
don’t consume much time ( only about 1:30 to 2 hous ) , the rituals
which previously performed for 40 days are now performed for 15 days
.”  
In such transition period ( where shortening of *prayoga pustaka* was
taking place ) kAThakas evolved a laghu rUdra suktA which was an easy
substitute to bulky rUdraM .In case of time’s devil , generally (in
north ) first sixteen mantras of namakaM are recited .Peculiarly
kAThakas evolved a unique laghu rUdra sukta.  
A pseudo dhyAna mantra is recited in beginning by kAthakas and then
last 11 mantras of namakaM with two additional mantras , first of them
is tvarita rUdra mantra and second is vedic aghor mantra , are recited
.This 14 mantras in total makes *laghu rUdra sukta*.( 14 mantras flashes
back my memory to 14 *mantramaheshvaras* in trika system )
