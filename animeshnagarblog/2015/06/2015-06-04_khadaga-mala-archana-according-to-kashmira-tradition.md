khadagamAlA in kashmIra srIvidyA tradition

saktIsangaM tantra describes three schools of kulamArga srIvidyA in
bhAratvarsha .

1\) kashmIra school ( with two subdivisions purvakaulikas and
Uttarkaulikas , prevalent in kashmIra , alive )

2\) gauda school ( prevalent inbanga desha ,srI kula practically dead
)

3\) kerala school ( various subdivisions among nAmbothiris and
nayyaras, prevalent in kerala , alive , meppada sampradAya is famous )

kashmIra was once famous for its kaula mArga srI vidyA ( kashmir
sampradAya )and srI nagar was headquarter of kulamArga anuyAyIns.With
attacks of AtAtAyIns and scarcity of eligible students kaula school
faced a sudden decline.All mAheshwara Acharyas of kashmIra desha were
UpAsakas of srI vidyA ( secretly ).What we have today is some upAsakas
in dark , fragment of some granthas and past glory.  
kashmIra sampradAya worship srI chakra in samhAra krama. In samhAra
karma, each devI is worshiped and is absorbed into the next devI , and
it continues until we reach srI kalilA, in whom, by that time, all the
devI will be absorbed.

khadaga mAlA is famous mAla mantra used for srI chakra archana ,
different sampradAyas have variations in archanA krama and text of it
.It is not merely a stotra or a hymn but is a mAlA mantra which invokes
srI kAmeshvarI along with all her Avarana devtA ,it is a very powerful
invocation for srI chakra worship. There are many variations based on
different tantras and sampradAya bheda. Even the number of letters in
mAlA is calculated differently based on different readings of the mAlA ,
again due to sampradAya bheda and also depending on whether the mAlA is
chanted for kAmya or nishkAmaya purpose. pATha bheda depends upon oneâ€™s
own samprayadAya , grantha it follows and finally on gurU
krama.Following is khadaga mAla archana prayoga based on kashmIra
sampradAya.
