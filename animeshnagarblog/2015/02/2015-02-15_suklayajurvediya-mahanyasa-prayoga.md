suklayajurvedIya mahAnyAsa prayoga

*mahAnyAsaM* is recited to purify the body, mind and soul of all the
impurities. It is a part of the methodology of chanting of the
*rUdraM* on special occasions such as *ekAdasharUdraM , laghu rUdraM ,
mahA rUdraM and ati Rudram.* It invokes different deities and in the
different limbs (anga’s) of the chanter. Such an invoking is done to
seek the blessings of the Lord, and at the same time giving one and all
a feeling of the immediate presence of the Lord in the vicinity of the
chanting. The self-purification process is mandatory prior to the
chanting of *Sri rUdraM* during the specialoccasions mentioned above .
So *rUdra kalAs* are invoked within the devotee to become a rUdra
himself, who can then commence the worship of the *shivalinga*. It must
be remembered that the *mahAnyAsaM* confers on the person purity for
that particular occasion only and not throughout the day and much less
throughout one’s lifetime.There are many versions of the *mahAnyAsaM*
but in case of shuklayajurveda ‘*brihad-pArAshara smritiukta* ‘ version
is employed.
