mahAnyAsaM from nepAlamandala

From the earliest vedic period ‘*shukla yajurveda* ‘(in mAdhyandina sub
recension ) was prevalent in *nepAlamandala*. ( only *HindurAshtra*
**Nepal ).** Famous kingdom of ‘videharAja janaka ‘ actually will have
included some parts of the *nepAlamandala*  
. These then would be the  
earliest literary references and material remains of Vedic culture in
*nepAl*. There are several authentic and peculiar ritual handbooks
belonging to *mAdhyandina* *shAkhA* in *nepAlamandala* . It seems that
in *nepAl* of the 15th century, the old way of Veda recitation as
described by the great grammarian *pAninI* was still extant, while it
had died out in this form in most parts of India. Today, this type of
recitation survives only with some families in *kerala*. It would,
therefore, seem that the older way of Vedic recitation, which dates back
even to earliest vedic times (i. e. pronouncing the *UddAta*, and not
the *svarita* as the syllable with the highest tone) . The medieval
Vedic transmission and the actual recital of the texts therefore seems
to have been very conservative and faithful in nepAl. On the other hand,
there was a considerable influence of the North Indian traditions,
coming with the *maithilI* Brahmins.

While undergoing a nepAlI treaties ‘ ***bAlabodhinI rUdrAbhisheka
paddhati*** ‘ (***बालबोधिनी रुद्राभिषेकपद्धति*** ) I came to know about
a peculiar form of mahAnyAsaM prevalent only in practice of *vAjasaneya
brahmins* ( or *shuklayaju-shAkhAdhyAyins* )of *nepAlamanda*. Deviating
from *shuklayajurveda-sarvAnukrama sutra* ( a treatise describing rishI
, devatA ,chhanda of mAdhyandina samhitA ),it mentions of peculiar
*rishIs* and *devatAs* for the mantras.  
The treatise neither mentions of the original source from where these
version of *mahAnyAsaM* is taken nor of peculiar *vinIyogas*. A tantric
infulence is also their on this version , as it starts *nyAsa* procedure
from *SrI kanTha mAtrUkAnyAsa (श्री कण्ठ मातृकन्यास ).(* a pure *shaiva
tantric nyAsa* ). Then *laghunyAyasaM* is performed, also several
*nyAsaMs* are performed by mantras of rUdrI . In last a *purvapujA* is
performed to lord *shiva* .Of course the instructions are in nepAl
bhAshA but mantras are in Sanskrit. The script is of devanAgrI lipI .
