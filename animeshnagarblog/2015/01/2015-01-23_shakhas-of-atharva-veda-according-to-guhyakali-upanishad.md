shAkhAs of atharva veda according to guhyakAlI upanishad

‘*guhyakAlI upanishad*‘ belongs to *guhyakAlI khanda* of *mahAkAla
samhitA*. *mahAkAla samhitA* is a tantric text dealing with the worship
of ‘ *navakAlIs* ‘.  
{ The *navakAlIs* are  
1) *dakshiña kAlI*  
2) *bhadra kAlI*  
3) *shamshAna kAlI*  
4) *kAla kAlI*  
5) *guhya kAlI*  
6) *kAmakalA kAlI*  
7) *dhana kAlI*  
8) *siddhI ( hamsa ) kAlI*  
9) *chanDa kAlI* }  
The *guhyakAlI* section of *mahAkAla samhitA* is a voluminous work,
comprising many thousands of verses and with ‘*guhyakAlI* ‘as its focus.
But the work also covers a number of other topics in equally great
detail, and along the way also includes subjects rarely referred to in
other tantras. One of such subject is description of *shAkhAs of
atharva* *veda* in upanishad .  
The *guhyakAlI upanishad* in its opening describes 6 shAkhAs of
‘*bhrugavAngirasa veda’* and affiliate itself with last one.  
{ A parallel case is of vaishnava ‘ *tripAdavibhutI
mahanArAyan upnishad’* , which affiliate itself with the *devadarsha*
*shAkhA* of same . “ब्रह्मन् देवदर्शीत्याख्याथर्वणशाखायां  
परमतत्त्वरहस्याख्याथर्वणमहानारायणोपनिषदि गुरुशिष्यसंवादः  
पुरातनः प्रसिद्धतया जागर्ति \|”(TMU 1.1 )  
}  
The *guhyakAlI upanishad* mentions of following 6 shAkhAs.

*1) vAratantava shAkhA*  
*2) mauñjAyana* *shAkhA*  
*3) tArnabaindava* *shAkhA*  
*4) shaunaka* *shAkhA*  
*5) paippalAda* *shAkhA*  
*6) saumantava* *shAkhA*

Interestingly mention of this shAkhAs are in order of youngest to
oldest.  
For instance the 6) *saumantava* *shAkhA* is oldest shAkhA as bramhanda
purAñ mentions ” *taThaivAtharva vedasya sumantuM RishitaM* “.SrI vyAsa
who divided veda in four parts, imparted atharvaveda ( firstly ) to
sumantu. The pravachan kartA rishI is sumantu of this shAkhA .  
Next comes the *paippalAda* shAkhA , no need to say it is chronically
older then that of *shaunaka* . No mention of *tAranbaindava* shAkhA is
there in present vedic , *puranic* and tantric literature.  
Next comes *mauñjAyana* shAkhA , *bramhanda purAñ* narrates ”

*saunaka maharshI* imparted *atharvan* veda to 1) *babhrava*  
2) saindhavAyan. *saindhavAyan* again imparted it to *muñjAyan* (
*muñjakesha* ).So chronically this shAkhA is younger then that of
saunaka. Again no traces of vAratantava shAkhA is there . Probably
vAratantava and tArnabaindva are other name of some famous shAkhAs.

There is no direct relation of *atharvaveda* and *guhya kAli tradition*
but *kAlikAgam* ( also known as *kAlamrityu* tantra ) mentions of
several *tantric prayogas* related to guhyakAlI as the very essence of
atharva veda. A nepAli digest of the same source on the propitiation of
the pratyangirA and guhyakAlI contains a chapter setting out a Paddhati
for the worship of the latter whose colophon attributes it to the
*atharvan* samhitA of the **hAhArAva** tantra.  
( The colophon reads  
*ItI hAhArAva tantre atharvansamhitAyaM guhyakAlI pujA patalaH* )  
Also to be considered in this context is the *kubjikopnishad* preserved
in Nepalese manuscripts, in which the cult of the *kubjikA* is expounded
by *sanatkumAra* to paippalAda for the use in *abhichAra prayoga* by
*atharvavedins*.
