agni and aTharvana

These passages contain one or more verses which allude to the episode of
agni’s hiding, mostly found in hymns dedicated to agni which otherwise
deal with other aspects of the god

” He ( agni ) hides three times in three different places: first in the
sea, then in the earth (in which he dissolves), then in the ocean.
Agni’s presence is revealed or brought forth by three different means in
each case. When he hides in the sea, the gods cannot find him, although
they look for him. The fire then sees the sage aTharvana, and requests
him to carry the oblations in his stead . Then the fire goes to some
other place, but the fish betray him, and he curses them thus: “***You
shall be the food of creatures in your various modes of being”***: Then
the fire again requests  
aTharvana to carry the oblations for him. aTharvana tries to persuade
him to resume his duties, but Agni refuses and abandons his body. He
enters the earth, thereby producing various metals and precious stones
out of different parts of his discarded body. There he remains fixed in
the highest penance, but is again roused by the combined austerities of
bhrgu, angirasa and other seers, and bursts into flames. Seeing the
sages, he takes fright once more, and hides in the ocean, where he
disappears. The whole world is afraid and turns to aTharvana for help.
aTharvana sees the fire, and creates the worlds. Then he churns the
great ocean and the fire reappears from the water, and henceforth always
carries the oblations . aTharvana finds agni hiding in a lotus-leaf,
thus being the only sage credited with finding the hidden agni. At
times, aTharvana also seems to be a name of agni himself.”
