kauThuma sAmavedaM yagnyopavIta dhArana prayoga

Following sAmaveda yagnyopavIta dhArana prayoga is employed by sAmavedIn
brAhmans of my city UjjainI.( generally all families are
kauThuma-shAkhAdhyAyI ).I was allowed to photograph some portions of
there ritual manual ” **sAmavedIyahnika** “.The prayoga was published in
90’s ( in Banarasa from chaukhamba publications).The practice of scared
tread is quite peculiar, prayoga first instructs of making yagnyopavIta
then wearing it. Instead of ‘**yagnyopavitaM…….’** they use mantra
‘**yagnyopavItamasI……****‘ for wearing and after achamanaM they recite
the **yagnyopavitaM……** **mantra. The procedure was peculiar in
comparison with other prayogams published in south India and drawn my
attention. Even the sandhyavandan in prayoga book have larger deviation
from south Indian kauThumas.
