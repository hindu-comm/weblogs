To kAlI , tArA and sundarI

Fool like mine tries to praise you,  
is it wonder or your grace ?  
Courage of mine with words that are few  
is nothing but my love for thee !

Standing on corpse *shiva*  
Oh ***kAlI*** , mother of *rAmakrishna*  
Dressed with garland of alphabets ,  
I have devine vision of thee

Oh , blue complexion goddess **tArA**  
Mother of *vAmAkhepA*  
dancing in fearful *shamshAna*,  
I have devine vision of thee

Oh queen of kAmeshwara ***sundarI***  
mother of ‘*shankara* ‘  
Sitting on the throne of panchapreta  
I have devine vision of thee

My eyes glitters when I sing praise of thee ,  
When thy devine grace will be on me .
