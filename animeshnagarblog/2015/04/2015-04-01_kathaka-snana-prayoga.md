lakshman rAinA shivAcharya** ) .The manual have sandhyA prayoga ,
tarpana prayoga, nitya snAna prayoga , gurU gItA in handwriting of srI
lakshman joo. Although mantras are from *kAthaka samhitA* and *laugAkshI
grihya sutraM* but neither vedic swaras are marked nor recited with
swaras. All mantras are chanted in ***EkashrutI mode***.
