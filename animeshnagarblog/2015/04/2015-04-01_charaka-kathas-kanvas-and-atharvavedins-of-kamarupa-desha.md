charaka kaThas , kAnvas and atharvavedins of kAmarUpa desha

The earliest description of brAhman civilization in Eastern India (
*kAmarUpa desha* )  is tracedback in several *purans* ( *kAlikA purAn ,
skanda purAn, kartoyA mahAtmaya* ) and tantra granthas.( *yoginI tantra
, kAmakhya tantra , vArAhI tantra* ). According to the tradition Lord
‘vAraha’ and goddess ‘bhumI’ had a son ‘ naraka'( bhAuma ). vAraha
bhagavAn coronated ‘ naraka’ for kingdom of *kAmarUpa desha* with
*prAgajyotishpura* as capital. He was first to invite brAhmans to his
kingdom i.e. Eastern India .Several brAhmans well versed in vedas,
tantras, *puranas* , *shAstras*, astrology and astronomy were settled
in *kAmarUpa desha* by him. By curse of sage *vashisTha due to cause of
not honouring him, h*is kingdom got demolished. Although it’s kind of
myth, yet *‘naraka-bhAuma’* have pseudo relation as founder ( *mula
purUsha* ) with bhAuma dynasty but no factual record of this. Afterward
in copper inscriptions of bhAuma dynasty /*varman dynasty*( descends of
naraka- *bhAuma* ) we find name, gotra , shAkhA , pravara of these
brAhmans who were settled in kAmarUpa desha. nidhanpur copper
*inscription by king bhAskara varma (600-650 CE ) was a* renewal of
lost copper *inscription* of land grant (bhumI dAna) to205 brAhmans
by king bhutI varman ( 518-542 CE ) *.*From *‘nidhanpur copper’*
inscription , we came to know that followers of five shAkhAs were
settled in *kAmarUpa desha namely .*

1\) Rigveda- brihavacha ( shAkal ) shAkhA

2\) Shukla yajurveda-mAdhyandina shAkhA

3\) krishna yajurveda –  
1. taittirIya shAkhA (with Apastamba sutra)  
2. ****charaka kaTha shAkhA****

4\) samaveda- chhAndoga shAkhA ( kAuthuma )

The number of charaka kaThas was only six out of 205 brAhmans.That
clearly show , kaThas were a minority shAkhA group. These seven brAhmans
were

1\) **kushmAnda patra swAmIn** ( 40/305 , vatsa gotra )  
2) **sAdhU swAmin**  
( 51/205 , pArasharya gotra )  
3) **chandraprakAsha swAmIn**  
( 95/ 205 , samkrUtiyAyana gotra )  
4) **pramodasena swAmIn**  
( 120/205 , gargya gotra )  
5) **somasena swAmIn**  
(121/205 , gargya gotra )  
6) **ghoshsena swAmIn**  
(123/205 , gargya gotra )  
7) **Ishwara datta swAmIn**  
( 40/205 , vatsa gotra )

All these four gotras are mentioned in chAranIya pravarAdhyAya so no
doubt they all were transmigrated kaThas from kashmIra desha. . Last
three brAhman (except last ) mentioned were relatives or sagotras as
there surname and gotras are identical.  
All this land grants were made near the chandrapurI .And these brAhmans
were settled in a colony called ‘ *mayurshAmala* .In the Agrahara
mentioned above they lived for generations .When in course of time the
original copper-plate was destroyed, the officers of the State proceeded
to levy taxes on the lands. There upon the descendants of the grantees
came to karanasuvarana and explained their case to jyesthabhadra, who
was the officer-in-charge there.The new copperplate was issued by
bhAsakara varmana .  
Interestingly not a single atharvavedin is mentioned in this
inscription. Probably till 5th century not a single atharvavedin was
present in  
*kAmarUpa desha* .Later king *bhAskara varma* attempted to settled
atharvavedins ( mostly ***nAgara brAhmans*** from guRjar desha , with
paippalAda recension ) and kAnva shAkhAadhyAyins in *kAmarUpa desha* .
Later with the establishment of the bhAuma dynasty in Orissa many of the
descendants of the brAhmans to whom grants of land had been made,
migrated there. ( that’s the reason why Utkala desha have preserved
paippalAda and kAnva tradition ) Unfortunately the paippalAda and kAnva
tradition got extinct in *kAmarUpa desha* but is preserved in utkala
desha .

The’ neulpur grant ‘of subhakara deva ( about 7th century ) enlists
names of atharvavedins in kAmarUpa desha, who were granted lands.

The list of *gotra* and *pravara* of this brAhmans matches with that of
*nAgara brAhmans.*( courtesy of a treaties named as nAgara pushpAnjalI
).  
****pAninI , gaurIsrvasa ,vasisTha, sAndilya , paippalAyana, paippalAda
, parAsharya, darbhya**** are most frequent gotras ( generally all with
3 pravaras )  
among atharvavedins .  
In the copper plate grant of king valavarma of kAmarUpa there is
reference to a sectionof Brahmins belonging to the kAnva shAkhA with the
surname ***dhara*** and of kapila gotra. Another grant was made by king
ratnapAla to kAnvashAkhins of parAshara gotra and bhAradwAja gotra.  
Several other copper grant plates mentions of kAnvashAkhins of kAshyapa,
vishwAmitra gotra.

****Conclusion****

Due to effort of various kings different shAkhA brAhmans were settled
in kAmarUpa as they were living form of vedic dharama ( murta rUpa )
.For establishment and advancement of any kingdom ( dharma rAjya ) this
living encyclopedias were must , they were the torch bearers of vedic
dharma who propagated vedic dharma in north east.  
Better to end with words of periyvA” ….. So long as the Brahmin
possessed sattva-guna (the quality of goodness and purity) and so long
as he kept the Vedic tradition going and lived a simple life, others
recognized his value for society. They regarded him with affection and
respect and paced their trust in him. They realised that if society was
not afflicted by famine and disease (as in the case today), it was
because the sound of the Vedas pervaded everywhere and the performance
of Vedic recites created a healthy atmosphere around and brought its own
blessings. ”
