**By Jason kaul A Kashmiri Pandit.**

**Spot on ,Anita ji.I am a Kashmiri Pandit myself who is still living in
Kashmir.**

**I was a student then and saw everything with my own eyes………how my
community was driven out of Kashmir, their property looted and houses
burnt down.**

**Pandits were murdered in cold blood .There was a notorious character
called Bita Karate who took special pleasure in killing Pandits.**

**The popular slogan during those days was ‘Aeis banavav Pakistan, Batav
varaiye Batnivav saan’**

**\[we will make Pakistan without Pandits but with Pandit women\]…….**

**All this happened before my very eyes.**

**So I am not the least surprised when I hear about atrocities done by
taliban and other Muslim outfits.**

**This is true ugly face of Islam…….real Islam……..**
