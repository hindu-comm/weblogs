devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## Notes from the padmodbhavasaMhita

![](https://goghritam.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-20.png?w=502)

This is meant to be a note on some topics of interest from the padmodbhava saMhita and will be updated periodically.

According to the foreword by Dr. Kidambi Narasimhacharya, the padmodbhava saMhita is potentially one of the oldest pA\~ncharAtra saMhita-s as it is referred to in the pAdma, pArameshvara, puruShottama, mArkaNDeya, vishvAmitra and the viShNu saMhita-s and hence must be earlier than these. The sanatkumAra saMhita it is said, refers to the padmodbhava eleven times by explicitly asking the readers to refer to the same for some topics. My own observation is that the sanatkumAra especially does so in the mantroddhAra and mantra vAda sections.

The catushshatAxarI vidyA referred to both in the sanatkumAra saMhita and the parama saMhita can be found in the padmodbhava. However, both saMhita-s talk about the 400 in the context of pAtAla sAdhana with nR^isiMha i.e. the pAtAla nR^isiMha mantra, though the 400 vidya (421 axara-s in actual count) that is given in the padmodbhava as a mix of three mAla mantra-s and anuShTup mantra-s is more directed at viShNu along with the chaturvyUha and has no direct reference to nR^isiMha. The sanatkumAra has, chatuHshatAxarI vidyA proktA padmodbhave tu sA – चतुःशताक्षरी विद्या प्रोक्ता पद्मोद्भवे तु सा (shivarAtre 3.10), while in the parama saMhita we have chatuHshatAxarI mantro nArasiMha iti smR^itaH – चतुःशताक्षरी मन्त्रो नारसिंह इति स्मृतः (16.8). The shaiva compendium, IshAna shiva gurudeva paddhati also gives a catuH-shatAxara pAtAla nR^isiMha vidya. This gives rise to the doubt that some sections of the available padmodbhava might be incomplete. The third adhyAya of the shiva rAtra of the sanatkumAra and the 8th paTala of the padmodbhava bear many similarities and both are unique in the sense that this material is not usually found in other saMhita-s. The contents of these adhyAya-s in the two saMhita-s can be seen as the source material for the vaiShNava bhUta nigraha mantra-s, mirroring the contents of the shaiva bhUta tantra-s, both in syntax and application.

The ninth paTala has the following to say on UrdhvapuNDra.

वश्यार्थी कृष्णचूर्णेन श्रीच्चन्‌ रक्तेन धारयेत्‌

पीतेन मोक्षकामी तु श्वेतेनाथोर्ध्वपुण्ड्रकं

वर्तिदीपाकृतिं चैवमुत्पलं मुकुलाकृतिं

For vashya, the puNDra is done with black powder, while those desiring wealth red and yellow/yellowish-green for moxa. The shape of the puNDra may be like a wick, dIpa, an utpala (water lily-Blue Lotus), or like a flower bud, a lotus bud, a bamboo leaf, fish or tortoise shaped, or like a sha\~Nkha or like bhagavat pAda i.e. feet of bhagavAn viShNu.

Of the kAmya utsava-s, for vighna vAraNa (to remove obstacles) one may perform the patrachChedana utsava:

This is mentioned in the 30th paTala, the context is removing vighna-s arising to sins/faults, as the text gives us patrachChedam pravaxyAmi vighnanAshAya duShTajaM, पत्रच्छेदम्‌ प्रवक्ष्यामि विघ्ननाशाय दुष्टजं. The utsava involves cutting of various types of leaves in a variety of shapes and then offering to viShNu. The paTala mentions many different kinds of tools starting with a needle, that are used to cut the leaves into different shapes. The leaves are to be cut into a total of 24 different shapes including sha\~Nkha, chakra, gada , padma, gaja, ratha, haya, peacock, swan, temple, pitcher (kuMbha) etc. The leaves from which the shapes may be made are, banana, turmeric plant, lotus leaves, leaves of the night lotus and leaves of other plants. After making the required shapes the leaves are to be offered to bhagavAn in less than 1.5 days, beyond which one risks the leaves being transformed into nirmAlya. The leaves should be adorning, bhagavAn, the Asana of bhagavAn, the walls of garbha gR^iha, and outside, doing which is said to please viShNu and grant the wishes of the yajamAna.

The 30th paTala also mentions a certain kAmya garuDa pUja which is meant for eliminating both diseases and shatru-s. This is to be done after the archana to the mUla biMba to the garuDa vigraha along with garuDa mantra japa. It is said that garuDa being an aMsha of sankarShana destroys the roga-s. For the purpose one is to deploy the garuDa pa\~nchAkShari.

tri-laxmI – yoga laxmI, bhoga laxmI and vIra laxmI : The laxmI present in the vaxasthala (chest of bhagavAn) is yoga laxmI, the laxmI on the side of the viShNu is bhoga laxmI while the laxmI whose pratiShTha is done in a separate Alaya i.e. not in the garbha gR^iha is vIralaxmI. The three laxmI-s are to be towards the right of bhagavAn (like the separate vIra laxmI shrine to the right of nR^isiMha, in the old nR^isiMha Alaya in yAdAdri) while bhU devI is to be on the left and the laxmI biMba-s are to be made using the same dravya as that of bhagavAn but slightly smaller in size relative to the biMba of viShNu.
