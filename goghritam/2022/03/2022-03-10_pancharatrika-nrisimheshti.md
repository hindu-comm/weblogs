devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## pA\~ncharAtrika nR^isiMheShTi

![](https://goghritam.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/sudharshana.jpg?w=601)

While the main [laxmI narAyaNa yAga](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/2021/05/13/laxmi-narayana-yaga-vaibhaveshti/) is in process, a number of other iShTi-s may be performed by the AchArya on a need basis. If the yajamAna or his kuTuMba or bandhu mitra jana are suffering due to any pishAcha or duShTa graha-s, the AchArya might perform a nR^isiMheShTi.

Before narrating the details of the iShTi, the cause of such pishAcha janma-s is discussed. Such pishAchatva it is said, can possibly happen due to any lopa in the mantra, tantra, kriya, kAla & dravya while performing vedokta kAmya yaGYa-s. [Such people who turned into pishAcha/duShTa graha-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/11/27/the-strange-case-of-the-apastamba-sprite/), roam around mountain tops and forests while suffering, and they a seize a normal human when he chances upon such a paishAcha dwelling. The said nR^isiMheShTi is said to not only free the one who is seized by the pishAcha but also grant a better position to the pishAcha/duShTa graha itself.

The iShTi might be done of any day while the pradhAna laxmI nArAyaNa yAga is proceeding. The yajamAna is to get up early on the chosen day, clean himself, adorn himself with UrdhvapUNDra & tulasi mAla-s and while accompanied by bhakta-s & bhAgavatottama-s, should approach the AchArya and request him to free them from duShTa graha bAdha. The AchArya out of vAtsalya is to agree and proceed to the yAgashAla.

The AchArya first invokes vishvaksena for vighna vAraNa and perform punyAha vAchana for sarva dravya shuddhi. A vR^ittAkAra kuNDa or a pa\~nchakoNa kuNDa may be constructed for the purpose. A ShaTkoNa maNDala is to be made on a dhAnya pITha and a kalasha should be placed which is made of gold, silver or copper and adorned with UrdhvapuNDra-s, new cloth, pa\~ncha tvak -pallava-s, darbha kUrcha, nArikela and puShpamAla. Additionally it may be filled with pa\~nchAmR^ita, pa\~nchagavya, tulasI dala-s, akShata-s and various auShadhi-s. Gold which is a niShka in measure, should be made into a circular form and a very terrifying(..raudra rUpin…tIkSha dR^iShTirbhUta bhaya pradaH) eight handed form of nR^isiMha is to be inscribed on it. This is to be washed in pa\~ncha gavya and placed inside the kuMbha while uttering the mantra rAja and all upAchAra-s are performed to the nR^isiMha in the kuMbha along with a naivedya offering of dadhyannaM (curd rice), coconut and cow milk followed by tAMbUlAdi.

In the circular or pa\~nchakoNa sthaNDila that is already prepared earlier, after agni pratiShTha and saMskAra-s, samit-s, charu, Ajya, curd, cow milk, sesame oblations are made numbering 10,000 or 1000 or 108 with each of the dravya-s while uttering the nR^isiMha gAyatri. After pUrNAhuti, the kuMbha is touched with the saMpAtAjya and the remaining placed inside the kuMbha. The kuMbha is touched now and the nR^isiMha gAyatri uttered 108 or 28 times. aShTa dikpAlaka pUja is done around the kuMbha and the lokapAlaka-s are offered arghya pAdyAdi with their respective mantra-s. In front of the kuMbha, a ShaTkoNa maNDala is made with kuMkuma and other substances and the hetIsha ShaDaxari inscribed. darbha-s are placed in the maNDala and AvAhana & ArAdhana of sudarshana is performed. On the four sides of the maNDala the four names hetIsha, chakrarAja, sahasrAra & sudarshana are inscribed and archana is done with axata-s. A coconut is offered in the four directions and a haridrAnna (turmeric rice) bali is offered in the eight directions along with bali for kumudAdi gaNa-s and indrAdi dikpAla-s.

The final phase would involve the effected person to be taken near the maNDala while uttering the shAnti sUkta-s to the accompaniment of drums and other musical instruments and make him/her perform pradakShiNa to the ShaTkoNa maNDala and should be made to see the extremely terrifying form of nR^isiMha. The person then is to be made to sit in the ShaTkoNa maNDala and the water from the kuMbha is poured or the kuMbha jala can be mixed with more water and a snAna can be performed. The AchArya or someone competent is to take a pAsha or a daNDa and slightly (the text clearly says it should be gentle/manda) tap the effected person uttering mochaya mochaya while putting on a fierce countenance. The nR^isiMha form which is inscribed on the golden plate should be tied to the arm of the effected person. This removes all pishAcha and duShTa graha-s which run away on seeing the ShaTkoNa maNDala and the person gets completely relieved once he sits in the maNDala. Seeing the nR^isiMha raxa, the duShTa graha-s would never attempt to harm the individual again. Starting from that point, the person it is said will have good Arogya, bhoga & bhAgya and live long due to the kR^ipa of nR^isiMha. The iShTi is concluded by offering a satisfying amount of daxiNa to the AchArya and by arranging bhojana and daxiNa to other brAhmaNa-s.
