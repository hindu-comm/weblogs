devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## bhairavIya jAti

A brief note from the svachchanda tantra regarding the jAti of the initiates:

![](https://goghritam.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=491)

brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s, shUdra-s and others who are initiated into the path have the same dharma which is shiva dharma.

During pa\~nkti bhojana, the suggestion is to segregate those who belong to the stream, only based on the status of various levels of initiation i.e. putraka, sAdhaka and chuMbaka and not on the basis of the jAti before initiation into the path. All those in the path are said to belong to bhairavIya jAti.

ekapa\~nkti bhujaH sarve samayinastu varAnane : 4-541: As per the commentary, by sarve is meant all those initiates who before initiation belonged to various varNa-s from brAhmaNa-s to various saMkIrNa varNa-s.

Furthermore, it is said that by the mention of the earlier jAti of an initiate, one puts himself in a position requiring prAyaschitta.
