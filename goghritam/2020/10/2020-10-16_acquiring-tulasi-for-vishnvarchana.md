devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## Acquiring tulasI forviShNvarchana

That tulasi is to be acquired for the purpose of viShNvarchana is well
known. When there is a shortage of the same or if unavailable, one can
resort to alternatives. The former always being preferable to the later,
as outlined below:

tulasI flower is to be offered if available, and in its absence tulasi
pallava i.e a twig / sprig of tulasI may be acquired. If not, a tulasi
sprout or 4 to 6 leaves can be offered. Even if that is not possible,
tulasI kAShTha (dried or undried stem) can be used or the tulasI root
when stem is unavailable. When even this is not possible, clay
(mR^ittikA – perhaps clay on which tulasI grew earlier?) can be offered.
As a final resort, one utters the name tulasI when all of the above are
unavailable. – From the vaikhAnasa ahnikAmR^itaM

Going by this, it would seem, those living in an area where tulasI might
not grow or will be unavailable for few months of the year, can utilize
tulasI maNi / beads which are made from the stem, as a ready offering
for archana.

When acquiring tulasI for archana one utters:

tulasyamR^ita janmAsi sadA tvaM keshava priye  
keshavArthelunAmi tvAM varadAbhava shobhane  
tvanmUle sarvatIrthAni tvanmadhye sarvadevatAH  
tvadagre viShNupatnI cha tulasi tvAM namAmyahaM

तुलस्यमृत जन्मासि सदा त्वं केशव प्रिये  
केशवार्थेलुनामि त्वां वरदाभव शोभने  
त्वन्मूले सर्वतीर्थानि त्वन्मध्ये सर्वदेवताः  
त्वदग्रे विष्णुपत्नी च तुलसि त्वां नमाम्यहं

Apart from the above there are two more known usages of tulasI kAShTha
i.e. the dried stem of a mature tulasI plant, in the context of
vaiShNava sAdhana-s. The gandha extracted from the tulasI stem is to be
offered to viShNu either by itself or mixed with other fragrant
substances. This is said to be very pleasing to viShNu as seen in the
following shloka from the mArgashIrSha mAhatmya:

tulasI chandanopetaM mAmatyanta sukhAvahaM  
yo dadAti hi mAM nityaM tulasI kAShTha saMbhavaM

तुलसी चन्दनोपेतं मामत्यन्त सुखावहं  
यो ददाति हि मां नित्यं तुलसी काष्ठ संभवं

The third use is for a simple yantra that is to be drawn on pure
sandalwood plank with chandana as ink, using a tulasI kAShTha as pen.
Then one performs archana to the same and does aShTAkSharI japa,
followed by viShNu sahasranAma pArAyaNa with each of the 108 shloka-s
coupled with aShTAkShari.
