**The 18 steps:**

The 18 steps on shabari giri are said to be indicative of various
deities as listed below:

1\. nAga yakShi 2. mahiSha mardini 3. annapUrNa 4. kAlI 5. kR^iShNa kAlI
6. shakti bhairavI
7. kArtavIrya
8. kR^iShNAbha
9. hiDuMba
10. bhetAla
11. nAgarAja
12. reNukA
13. svapna vArAhI
14. pratya\~NgirA
15. bhUmi
16. aghora
17. pAshupata
18. mR^ityunjaya

mahiSha -mardini – Though specifically called mahiSha mardini, chaNDikA
is meant here and navArNa seems to be employed.

kR^iShNa kAlI – Not the combined kR^iShNa devakIputra + kAlI that is
popular in Bengal but a different version of kAlI popular in chera desha
, called as karuM kAli.

kR^iShNAbha – Sanskrit for karuppu svAmi.

shakti bhairavI – From the formula deployed, it is to be understood as
tripura bhairavI

aghora – What seem to be used in practice is the aghorAstra.

From folk lore which must have been based on some root text expounding
the rites or tattva of shAstA we gather that the 18 steps represent the
18 astra-s of ayyappa who is seen as infused with the tejas of the deity
shAstA. Most likely these 18 vidyA-s mentioned above, are the vidyA-s
that ayyappa practiced, mastered & deployed during his time. If so, this
is an interesting tradition as this seems like a list of vidyA-s
complementing and compounding each other when appropriately deployed and
are quite useful for a great vIra/warrior like ayyappa who is endowed
with the aMsha of dharma-yoga shAstA.

There is also the practice of visiting shabari giri 18 times and each
time the sAdhaka is considered as advanced and the experience is
associated with specific symbols. As an example, the sAdhaka visiting
shabari giri for the first time is called a kanni svAmi represented by
an arrow, the fifth time by a bow and arrow and the 15th time/year by a
trishUla.

Apart from the above, the 18 steps also have a different significance
where different aspects of the human nature are said to be conquered by
invoking and worshiping specific deities (a different list from the
above) at each step as mentioned below. The procedure given is a mini
sankalpa for each step followed by ShoDashopachAra pUja and a
puShpArchana with a nAmAvali (12 to 16 names) for each devata.

1.  guNa sought to bring under control by the sAdhaka: kAma. devata
    invoked : kAma deva. Ayudha – Arrow /shara. From second, we will
    list only the guNa, devatA and Ayudha.
2.  krodha – rudra – ChurikA/short sword
3.  lobha – viShNu – ghaNTa
4.  mada – dakShiNAmUrti – gadA
5.  mAtsarya – hayagrIva – pA\~nchajanya
6.  moha – nAgeshvara – nAgAstra
7.  darpa- balarAma – halAyudha
8.  ahaMkAra – indra – vajra
9.  vakra dR^iShTi – Aditya – sudarshana
10. kaTu shabda – gaNesha /viShvaksena – danta
11. gandhAkarShana – nArasiMha – nakhAyudha
12. jihva chApalya – varuNa – varuNAstra
13. sparsha sukha lAlasatvaM -vAyu – charma
14. sattva guNa – viShNu – shAra\~Nga
15. rajo guNa – brahma – brahmAstra
16. tama – shiva/pashupati- pAshupatAstra
17. guNa nigraha siddhi – shrI devi – shUla
18. moxa/GYAna – bhuvaneshvarI/rAja rAjeshvarI – shUlAyudhaM

If you prefer a rather dramatic description of the above devata-s (the
first list starting with nAga yakShi) with some music added, you can see
it in the below video from a Telugu movie: The list of 18 in the video
is different from the above and perhaps can be attributed to a different
lineage/tradition. This list has karNa pishAchI, subrahmaNya, and
bhadrakAlI instead of aghora, pAshupata and mR^ityunjaya.

**Various mUrti-s of shAstA:**

Like other deities in the Hindu world there are various shAsta-s and the
known ones are listed below from various sources. Most of the mUrti-s of
shAstA in the list below, have their own mantra with which they are
invoked. Some mUrti-s overlap and might have a common mantra.

pratyakSha shAstA,

revanta shAstA

kubera shAstA

rudra shAstA

bhUtAdhipa shAstA

haMsa madana shAstA

Arya shAstA

ghoShavati shAstA

bhuvana shAstA

goptR^i shAstA

mohana shAstA – sammohana

kirAta shAstA

hariharAtmaja shAstA / mahA shAstA

GYAna shAstA

bAla shAsttA,

brahma shAstA – A dhyAna shloka of the same is said to be from the rare
text chidaMbara rahasyaM.

viShNu shAstA

kalyAna varada shAstA – pUrNA puShkalA sameta

laxmI shAstA

mantra shAstA

ashvArUDha shAstA

yoga shAstA – dharma shAstA

It is said that the rites**++** to shAstA are based on the AkAsha
bhairava kalpa (ABK)\*\*. About two decades ago when witnessing a shAstA
pratiShTha, there were several homa kuNDa-s set up as part of the
pratiShTha for the deities which are the main focus of the ABK. The ABK
mentions six shAstA-s: mahA shAstA, jagat shAstA, shatru shAstA, agni
shAstA, bAla shAstA & prashAstA. An interesting part of the shAstA
archana according to ABK involves the invoking of 16 shaktis in the
ShoDasha dala: durgA, bhairavI, tvaritA, bhuvaneshvarI, nArAyaNI,
bhadrakAlI, rudrANI, chaNDikA, vArAhI, siddhalaxmI, mAta\~NgI,
manonmanI, kAlarAtrI, mahAmAyA, mahiShAsura mardini & nishAcharI.

The mahAlaxmI ratna kosha (MRK)also touches upon the shAstA upAsana
briefly. The material is similar to the one in the ABK with the
exception that MRK lists out one more variant of the popular
mAhAshAstR^i mantra. The list of six shAsta-s in MRK is: mahAshAstA,
jagatshAstA, shatrushAstA, sarvashAstA, shAstA & prashAstA.

Other sources for shAstA: 1) bhUtanAtha upakhyAna 2) guhya ratna
chintAmaNi (some shAstA mAla mantra-s are said to be form this text). 3)
Possibly chidambara rahasya ( The dhyAna of a certain brahma shAstA is
said to be from here)

\*\**As an aside, the ABK can be viewed as the southern equivalent of
the rudrayAmala which itself is seen as a tAntrika equivalent of skanda
purANa. However unlike the rudrayAmala, the satellite texts claiming to
be part of the ABK seem more organized & genuine. We get this impression
because the subject matter of most of these texts is limited to the
deities of interest for the ABK system and the material bears some
degree to similarity to ABK.*

shabari giri.*
