devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## nava durgA

dakAro daityanAshArthaH ukAro vighna nAshakaH  
repho rogaghnavachanaH gashcha pApapraNAshakaH  
bhaya shatrughna vachanaH AkAraH parikIrtitaH

That devata which destroys daityas, along with the vighna-s, roga-s,
pApa-s, bhaya-s, & shatru-s of her votaies is called durgA.

devAnAM durgate strANAt durgeti parikIrtitA  
duritaM gacchati smR^ityA tasmAddurgeti kIrtitA  
durgamAsurahantrItvAt durgeti parikIrtitaH

Since she saved the deva-s from utter misfortune or from dire straits
she is called durgA, or that by smaraNa of which durita-s go away is
called durgA or that devata which killed durgamAsura (perhaps to be seen
a personification of all kinds of ill luck & misfortune) is called
durgA.

Various sets of nava durgA-s are mentioned in different places. The
standard list starting with shailaputrI is well known. The list
comprising shailaputrI, brahmachAriNI, chandraghanTA, kUShmANDa,
skandamAtA, kAtyAyanI, kAlarAtrI, mahAgaurI &siddhidAtrI seems to have
been popular in kAshmIra desha in the past. Another list has jAtaveda
durgA, vanadurgA, shUlinI durgA, shAnti durgA, shabari durgA, jvala
durgA, lavaNa durgA, dIpa durgA & Asuri durgA. A context for each of
these nine durgA-s is provided below. Another list from a particular
lineage has rudra durgA, krUra durgA, anuchaNDikA, chaNDadurgA,
sachidurgA, shaiva durgA, chaNDikA, ugrachaNDA & navamI as the nava
durgA-s.

Two sets of navadurgA-s mentioned in the durgA kosha:

1.  nIlakaNThI, kShemankarI, harasiddhi, rudrAMsha durgA, jaya durgA,
    agni durgA, vindhyavAsinI durgA, vana durgA and ripumArini durgA.
2.  mahAlakShmI, nandA, kShemankarI, shiva dUtI, mahA chanDI, bhrAmarI,
    sarva ma\~NgalA, revatI & hari siddhi
