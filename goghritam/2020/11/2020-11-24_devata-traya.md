devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## devatA traya

kula devata, iShTa devata & siddha devata are the devata traya meant for
this post.

kula devata: The deity invoked in the family through generations. The
default guardian deity of the family/clan.

iShTa devata – The deity, the idea/concept of which is most fascinating
to the practitioner among the multitude of deva-s/devI-s.

siddha devata – The deity who grants favor quickly to that particular
practitioner. Deity with whom a practitioner shares a natural
bond/affinity. The reasons for such can be many. Examples include: 1)
Deity was propitiated in the past by the parents and the practitioner
inherited this like genes. 2) The svabhAva of the practitioner resonates
well with that of the devata. etc 3) Or some attribute this to upAsana
done in a past janma…which IMO is actually a restatement of 1.

If there are deities that naturally favor a practitioner then it should
naturally/logically follow that there must be chance of a(or some) deity
being naturally unfavorable to some practitioner. There are indeed such
known cases. As an example, a great AchArya who is a shrIvidyA upAsaka
of high caliber has a situation where upAsana of a certain deity will
not go well for the family. Other examples exist.

Now for the complications:

It is observed that for many, iShTa devata and siddha devata are not the
same. It is common to have enormous bhakti towards a certain iShTa
devata while not perceiving any external affinity for the siddha
devatA/mantra. The why of it is not always easy to pinpoint. A
practitioner x might be a staunch vaiShNava externally and it is
possible that some shaiva mantra-s give him results quicker rather than
the vaiShNava ones & vice versa.

kula devata is forgotten: Options:

1.  Ask elders or the purohita-s of the village or town and find out
2.  Approach someone who can perform a prashna and find out.
3.  At times an advanced yoginI/yogin or a siddha puruSha might be able
    to figure it out. This rarely happens.
4.  A purohita can perform rituals to make his kula devata as yours if
    there is sufficient bonding or under special circumstances out of
    compassion – As per AchArya vachana.

iShTa devata: One has many iShTa devata-s. This is not an issue per se.
However, if one wants to focus, the closest of the iShTa devata-s may be
made a central focus with all others as AmnAya devata-s or parivAra
devata-s. The later part should be preferably done under expert
guidance. Like the pa\~nchAyatana for example, but being inclusive of
other very important deities.

siddha devata: Is the hardest to find. Sometimes there may not be one at
that time/stage in life. Procedures to find out the same:

1.  Usage of any of the common chakra-s i.e. a-ka-tha chakra, nakShatra
    chakra, siddhAri chakra etc.
2.  A ritual performed for the same under the guidance of an AchArya
3.  A yoginI/yogin or a siddha can sometimes see and instruct which
    devata.
4.  Employ someone who can perform prashna to determine the same.
5.  Most common method is to employ astrological knowledge and look at
    birth chart.

Other snippets: A family has laxmI nR^isiMha as kula devata. The eldest
child of each generation is named after the devata. Family observes that
deviating from this, results in negative happenings consistently.
Account narrated in person to me by a member of the said family.

Another anecdote picked from internet. A brAhmaNa family has a deity as
kula devata for whom animal sacrifice is to be made yearly. Desisting
from the same despite repeated indications from the devata resulting in
Apada/calamity.
