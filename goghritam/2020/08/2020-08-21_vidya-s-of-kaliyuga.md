devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## vidyA-s of kaliyuga

For kali yuga, it is said that kAlI and bhairava are awake.

Many other vidyA-s like shAkaMbharI, pratya\~NgirA, durgA, tArA, etc we
are told are asleep and that mere act of japa awakens them. This act of
awakening is said to be offending to the respective devata-s.

However, this statement should be seen as being made to encourage
aspirants to take up bhairava and kAlI vidya-s and not to be taken
literally.

This is because we have upAsaka-s in our time who have achieved a great
degree of success with some of the vidyA-s which are said to be asleep.

We will come back later to understand the complete context, the
seriousness and the reality of the statement from the ka\~nkAla mAlinI.
