dashAvaraNa vanadurgA mahAyantraM

While there might be a multitude of durgA sahasranAma-s, few are listed below.

The first one from tantrarAja tantra with nArada as R^iShi starting as shrIdurgA durgatiharA paripUrNA… A second from rudrayAmala with maheshvara/mahAdeva as the R^iShi called as mantragarbha sahasranAma, because of it’s relation to mUla durgA, while the third is said to be from kulArNava and is called as dakArAtmaka durgA sahasranAma. These three can be found in the durgA kosha published by SKR of kalpataru.

The version of durgA sahasranAma that is popular in Andhra will be listed as the fourth. This is the sahasranAma that one gets on asking for a durgA sahasranAma in any book store in Andhra. Though popular only as durgA sahasranAma, this sahasranAma is specifically meant for one of the nava durgA-s, as it has the mUla mantra of that durgA embedded and this aspect of the stotra is not popular. The source of the text for now is unclear.

A fifth durgA sahasranAma is also available, possibly only in Andhra but it is rare to find. This sahasranAma is said to incorporate the mantra of another one of the nava durgA-s though I personally haven’t decoded the how of it, but it is clearly related to that specific durgA. There is a sixth from the vishvasAra tantra with nArada as the R^iShi and the devata described as AdyAshaktir bhagavatI durgA devatA. One might add the mahiShamardinI sahasranAma as a seventh and a certain chaNDikA sahasranAma (Have a vague memory of seeing this somewhere..?) as an eighth.

There were some statements off-late by some shrIvidyA upAsaka-s filled with durmada or durahankAra (which seems to be a hallmark of most contemporary shrIvidyA upAsaka-s for whatever reason and an observation also shared by an accomplished elderly yoginI), likely arising from taking few statements of shrI kula texts literally, while they are meant to be arthavAda. Examples include statements like “durgA is the dvAra-pAlika for shrIvidyA/shrI kula deities”***^(\*\*)*** or that “durgA gives only materialistic benefits and that real spiritual elevation comes from practice of shrI-kula” etc. The vanadurgA kalpa remarks “how pointless and lowly it is to approach a kalpa vR^ikSha and ask for a kaupIna (under garment) when it can grant far greater things”, to mean, what use is there in asking vanadurga for material benefits when she can grant moxa itself. It is quite baseless and misleading to think durgA upAsana is meant for materialistic benefits alone or to think that durgA upAsana is only for removing obstacles or Apada-s to facilitate some other upAsana. To say so, is to go against the statements of both the vanadurgA kalpa and the durgA saptashatI where bhagavatI clearly grants both bhoga and moxa in the thirteenth chapter. The vishvasAra tantra says the following about the durgA bIja: “zrI Izvara uvAca \| praNamya zyAmavarNAbhAM durgAM durgatinAzinIm \| **da**kAre **dakSiNAmUrti**r**ukAre** ca **umApatiH** \|\| **arddhacandre zivaH** sAkSAt devastribhuvanezvaraH \| durgAdhyA devatA proktA sarvadurgapraNAzinI \|\| yena bIjAdikaM kuryAt daivateva tadAdikam \| “

**“श्री ईश्वर उवाच । प्रणम्य श्यामवर्णाभां दुर्गां दुर्गतिनाशिनीम्‌ । दकारे दक्षिणामूर्तिरुकारे च उमापतिः ॥ अर्द्धचन्द्रे शिवः साक्षात्‌ देवस्त्रिभुवनेश्वरः । दुर्गाध्या देवता प्रोक्ता सर्वदुर्गप्रणाशिनी ॥ येन बीजादिकं कुर्यात्‌ दैवतेव तदादिकम्‌ ।”**

dakAra is said to represent daxiNAmUrti while the ukAra is to represent umApati and the ardhachandra representing shiva himself. Each akShara of some durgA mantra-s is said to represent a specific deity and performing japa with such contemplation aided by appropriate visualization along with preparatory background, will bring favours from multiple deities. The equivalence/representation is not arbitrary and has the backing of shAstra and we have AkhyAna-s filled with awe-inspiring power, which support such an equivalence.

Or at other times, there is a confusion among some shrIvidyA aspirants/students/upAsaka-s, on whether durgA can be called as parameshvarI or if this word should be reserved only for a ShaDaxara mantra variant of a certain powerful and charming shrI-kula deity. While not denying that there might be “technical reasons” for calling the deity with the parameshvarI suffix, shrI kula does not get any exclusive rights on the parameshvarI pada, given the fact that we have mantra-s to other deities which are referred to “parameshvarI chAmuNDA mantra” or “shAmbhava parameshvarI chAmuNDA mantra”. The durgA saptashatI along with at-least one mAlA mantra of a specific durgA, call her as parameshvarI on multiple occasions and that should put the confusion to rest.

The dashAvaraNa vanadurgA yantra shown above, includes in itself the ShaDaxarI bAlA, nArAyaNa aShTAkShari, vaiShNava dvAdashAkShari and the mahAvidyA bagala (who is one of the a~Nga mantra-s for vanadurgA) and few other mantra-s. The pUrvA~Nga mantra-s for vanadurgA are guru, gaNapati, vaTuka (or svarNAkarShaNa bhairava in some tradition), mahA-vArAhI and brahmAstra-bagalAmukhI while the uttarA~Nga mantra-s are shiva pa~nchAkSharI, shrI-kR^iShNa mahAmantra (aShTAdashAkShari), mahAlakShmI, nArAyaNa-aShTAkSharI and the last one is daxiNa kAlI (or rAjashyAmalA in some tradition). daxiNA kAlI makes more sense here. The original text specifying the uttarA~Nga mantra-s says shyAmA which is kAlI. There is a record of a slight variation of this tradition though no known text specifies this. The a~Nga-s are similar to above but have kirAta vArAhI instead of mahAvArAhI, gopAla sundarI instead of kR^iShNa mahAvidyA , baDabAnala-nIlakaNTha-aghorAstra instead of pa~nchAkShari and the famed nArAyaNAstra instead of nArAyaNa aShTAkShari.

**\*\***1) It must be noted that the shrIvidyA person who made this statement, ran into some trouble due to unknown reasons, a few weeks after the incident and was required to do some parihAra-s. Not implying any direct connection but making a note of the same.

2\) A very elderly nR^isiMha upAsaka who was involved in solving numerous issues, who did nR^isiMha pratiShTha-s etc over several decades, records an instance, where a gentleman who has been a shrIvidyA upAsaka for almost 20 years, come to him with a problem. The elderly nR^isiMha upAsaka immediately suggested performance of the jAtavedAgni durgA mantra prefixed with bIja-s along with a brief vidhi, and the issue was resolved in a couple of weeks.

3\) An elderly yoginI associated with a deity, who in one way can be seen as a common intersecting deity between kAli-kula and the daurga-Agama, who removed scores of doSha-s over decades for many, surprised a shrIvidyA upAsaka, when she was able to pin point an issue which the shrIvidyA upAsaka has been struggling to know for quite sometime. The standard answer from shrI-kula anuyAyin-s (followers) would be to say that they have either not learnt shrIvidyA properly or that they havent been performing it properly.

These examples are here to show the importance of daurgAgama and it’s vidhi-s and are not meant to show other path-s in poor light. Undoubtedly, the shrI-kula mantra-s/deities are of great might/power and none of these examples are meant to deny that.
