devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## Andhra bAla grahachikitsa

Below is a summary of the bAla graha chikitsa extracted from three texts published in the Andhra country:

  
The three texts from which material is extracted are bAla graha chikitsa-1(BGC1 -compiled by piShiNi svomulu), bAla graha chikitsa-2(BGC2) and a section of the Andhran shUlinI durgA tantra. In the first two, the name of the graha which effects the child on the first day, first month and the first year is given along with the effects associated with the affliction till the year 16. This is followed by a remedy for the same which usually consists of an offering to the said graha, a special dhUpa with specific ingredients, a mantra that is uttered and/or sometimes written on a thin copper sheet or similar material along with a yantra that goes with it which is tied to the child. Additionally, an image of the graha that afflicts is also provided. In the first two (BGC1 & 2) versions, the details stay different except for the rUpa/form of the afflicting graha, while in the third i.e. shUlinI durgA tantra, no images are provided

  
In the case of BGC1, the mantra-s are directly addressed to the graha as, “oM namo bhagavati –kaphAlini– ehi ehi bAlika mu~ncha mu~ncha svAhA” and so on till 16th. In BGC2, the mantra-s till the 12th, take the form of “oM namo rAvaNAya -vudari/udari- ane devata bali tR^ipti bondi bAlakI sukhI sukhI svAhA”. The mantra-s from 13th to 16th remain the same as in BGC1. “vudari/udari ane devata bali tR^ipti bondi” is Telugu for “may the devata by name vudari/udari, being pleased by the offered bali…”.

  
The third source is the published shUlinI durgA tantra. This publication has essentially material drawn from shUlinI kalpa and the shUlinI durgA tantra available in Sanskrit, but with a commentary in Sanskrit by an Andhra mantrin named gopAla kR^iShNa shAstR^in. The bAla graha section however is not found in the shUlinI kalpa and the shUlinI durgA tantra but finds mention in the Andhran publication as an additional material. The shUlinI kalpa does treat the subject but quite briefly and is not as elaborate as found in the Andhran publication. This text considers graha-s till the 12th year. This text gives one mantra “oM shrIM phaT svAhA” for the first day/month/year and perhaps the same mantra is to be used till the sixth day. From the seventh, the mantra-s significantly differ from the other two sources and invoke viShNu in the form of nArAyaNa and vAsudeva to remove the doSha-s along with a list of offerings to be made for each graha. As an example, for the seventh day, the accompanying mantra that goes along with a special dhUpa for the day would be “oM nArAyaNAya trailokya-vidrAvaNAya jvala jvala oM hrIM phaT svAhA”.

An additional but brief section from BGC1 which has the garbhinI chikitsA vidhi to ensure safety of pregnant women will be added later…To continue.
