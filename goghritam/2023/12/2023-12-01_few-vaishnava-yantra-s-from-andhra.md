aShTa mukha gaNDa bheruNDa mahA yantraM

The first two are the hayagrIva yantra-s. The yantra 1 which is more elaborate than the second incorporates all the important vaiShNava mantras, i.e. the aShTAkShari dvAdashAkShari, vaiShNava ShaDakSharI, sudarshana and nR^isiMha. Interestingly on the outermost rim, it is enclosed by scribing the bIja nIM. Coming to the hayagrIva mantra, it has the standard hayagrIva mantra which is similar to the medha daxiNAmUrti in addition to the hayagrIva gAyatrI which is, vAgIshvarAya vidmahe hayagrIvAya dhImahi tanno haMsaH prachodayAt. One of the yantra-s incorporates the standard vidyArAja mantra from the hayagrIvopaniShad and additionally is also associated with an interesting hayagrIva mantra meant for kAmya which isnt seen elsewhere or at-least not as common as the vidyArAja and other variants.

The mantra goes thus: oM vANI -viyat-bhR^igu-agni+auM- vANI namo vidyA vAgIshvarAya sakala vidyApradAya vANI 2 -viyat-bhR^igu-agni+auM- hayagrIvAya mama sakala vidyA sumR^idu-madhura-rasabhAva-bhAsura-vAgjAlaM dehi 2 ramA 2 -viyat-bhR^igu-agni+auM- dAridrya vidveShaNAya laxmI hayagrIvAya dhana kanaka vastu vAhanAdyakhilaishvaryaM dApaya 2 shriyaM dehi 2 hsrAmAdi trayaM oM svAhA

On the third yantra named as the muralIdhara mahAyantra, one might say the yantra together with all the mantra-s that it incorporates is a distinct school of mantra shAstra in itself. On closer look one can see that the mantra-s of other devata-s like the mahAgaNapati, various bhairava-s, indrAkShI, the mAtR^ika-s, shAstA, vIrabhadra can all be found within the yantra. The central mantra/deity for the yantra is apparently muralIkR^iShNa or venugopAla. Thus, the central/mUla mantra-s for archana are said to be 1) klIM venugopAla charaNau sharaNaM prapadye 2) klIM kR^iShNAya vAsudevAya devakInandanAya nandagopa kumArAya govindAya namo namaH 3) vaiShNava dvAdashAkShari. For the yantra pUja or specifically for puShpa or tulasI archana, one uses the 24 names of viShNu thus: klIM keshavAya namaH, klIM nArAyaNAya namaH, klIM mAdhavAya namaH and so forth.

Coming to the prayoga-s, three among the several prayoga-s will be listed: 1) After daily archana, after japa of the mUla mantra-s mentioned above, one utters “oM klIM ruM rudrAvatArAya namaH mAM raxa 2 mama shatrUn bhaxa 2 shrI bhairavAya vaTukAya huM phaT, oM klIM brAhmI shaktibhyo namaH, aM asitA~Nga bhairavAya namaH”, for Atma raxaNa and shatru jaya. 2) After daily archana, after japa of the mUla mantra-s mentioned above, one utters “oM klIM vaiShNavyai namaH krIM krodha bhairavAya namaH, oM klIM kR^iShNa putrAya namaH sarva chorAn stambhaya Chedaya huM phaT svAhA” for chora stambhana to ensure thieves do not get to rob the house. 3) After daily archana, after japa of the mUla mantra-s mentioned above, one utters “oM klIM ghR^iNissUrya Aditya, bhAno bhAskara, mArthANDa chaNDa rashme divAkara, AyurArogyamaishvaryaM vidyAm dehi divAkara” for health, wealth and pANDityaM.

The tripAdvibhUti mahAvaikuNTha nArAyaNa yantra is from the devasthAna in annavaraM in Andhra. In the xetra, one might see the yantra, carved as a meru when having the pa~nchAyatana darshana downstairs. As we do not get to spend much time within to examine, I wish to mention this with a caution. It felt that this yantra is carved as a meru, but one to need to look at it closely before ascertaining the same. One can see that the yantra has within itself several vaiShNava mantra-s along with few shaiva ones. The most easily visible shaiva mantra is that of nIlakaNTha mahArudra and also garuDa, which goes thus: “oM namo nIlakaNThAya”. An old partial scan is all that is available to me now, which is the reason it has to be shown as two pieces.

The last two are gaNDa bheruNDa nR^isiMha yantra-s, of which the last one is associated with the mantra which goes thus: “oM namo bhagavate aShTa mukha gaNDa bheruNDa mahogrolkojvala-jvAlA sudarshana vArAha shrI laxmI nR^isiMhAya namaH”

A high resolution version of the muralIdhara mahA yantra will be uploaded in time.
