Similar to hayagrIva, the detailed upAsana and power of dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s is not spoken of much. He is seen as one of the teacher-deities, and is associated with shrIvidyA along with [hayagrIva](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/notes-on-hayagriva-siddhi-among-the-nastika-s/) and Ananda bhairava. For the lay populace, like [hayagrIva](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/2023/10/07/shri-laxmi-hayagriva-mahavishnur-devata/), he is an exam-deity or academics-deity. However, the compendiums which expound the mantra clearly mention mahA-dakShiNAmUrti, as sarvakAma phala prada (or prApya kAmAnasheShAn according to another compendium) i.e. granting all desires and as giving all puruShArtha-s dharma, artha, kAma and moxa (samasta-puruShArthadaM), in addition to mentioning that muni-s in the past attained divya GYAna by japa of dakShiNAmUrti mantra.

Two (potentially three) traditions of [dakShiNAmUrti](https://sreenivasaraos.com/category/dakshinamurthy/) upAsana will be discussed. The first one from kerala (and perhaps vogue in tamil nADu too?), is the tradition of nava dakShiNAmUrti. The second one is the upAsana of ShoDhasha daxiNAmUrti known in Andhra. A third tradition probably exists centered around the dakShiNAmUrti upaniShad. The first tradition includes the upAsana of nine dakShiNAmUrti-s which are medhA dakShiNAmUrti, lakShmI dakShiNAmUrti, kIrti dakShiNAmUrti, GYAna dakShiNAmUrti, sAMba dakShiNAmUrti, saubhAgya dakShiNAmUrti, vIra dakShiNAmUrti, saMhAra dakShiNAmUrti, doSha nivAraNa dakShiNAmUrti. The sAdhana of mahA dakShiNAmUrti is also included in this tradition along with the nava dakShiNAmUrti and their own prayoga-s. This tradition is also known to at-least one in the Telugu lands and the doSha nivAraNa dakShiNAmUrti, is known as apasmAra nAshaka dakShiNAmUrti with slight change in the mantra which comes from integrating/combining it with the laghu pAshupatA. The second tradition from Andhra will be reproduced from an earlier post: A dakShiNAmUrti upAsaka initiated in this tradition is supposed to perform daily pArAyaNa of a special and unique sUkta called the mAlA mantra sUkta, which is a collection of sixteen mAlA mantra-s of the dakShiNAmUrti-s mentioned below. The complete procedure involves performing standard preparatory ritual actions from snAna till digbandhana followed by pArAyaNa of the dakShiNAmUrti hR^idaya first, then by the mUla mantra japa with all the pUrvA~Nga and uttarA~Nga mantra-s. The mUla mantra spoken of here is that of medhA dakShiNAmUrti. Then one performs pArAyaNa of the mAlA mantra stava consisting the mAlA mantra-s of the following 16 dakShiNAmurti-s. This is further followed up by the recital of the mantra varNA valI stotraM, the dakShiNAmUrti jaganmohana kavachaM, the aShTottara and the sahasranAma stotra-s. The list of sixteen dakShiNAmUrti-s in this tradition includes, suddha dakShiNAmUrti, medhA dakShiNAmUrti, vidyA dakShiNAmUrti , laxmI dakShiNAmUrti , vAgIshvarAbhidAna shrI dakShiNAmUrti, vaTamUla nivAsAbhidAna shrI dakShiNAmUrti , sAMba dakShiNAmUrti , haMsa dakShiNAmUrti, lakuTa dakShiNAmUrti , chidaMbara dakShiNAmUrti , vIra dakShiNAmUrti, vIrabhadra dakShiNAmUrti , kIrti dakShiNAmUrti , brahma dakShiNAmUrti , shakti dakShiNAmUrti , siddha dakShiNAmUrti. The source of the mAlA mantra sUktaM consisting the mAlA mantra-s of above dakShiNAmUrti-s is said to be the sixty third chapter of the stotra khaNDa of dakShiNAmUrti saMhita as it is said towards the end “iti shrI dakShiNAmUrti saMhitAyAm-uparibhAge stotra khaNDe laxmI nArAyaNa saMvAde shrI dakShiNAmUrti mAlA mantra stavo nAma triShaShThitamo adhyAyaH”. The fruit of the pArAyaNa of the mAlA mantra stavaM is said to be, pacification of the vinAyaka-s(note the plural vinAyakau cha shAmyanti), stability of laxmI, rAjya siddhi, khecharatvaM, vidyA siddhi, fulfillment of all desires, destruction of disturbances, removal of all inauspiciousness and pApa-s. maharShi-s like vyAsa and others, deva-s, gandharva-s, dAnava-s, siddha-s, sAdhya-s, and yaxa-s are said to have attained mukti by reciting the mAlA mantra sUkta.

**yoga dakShiNAmUrti**

The pUrvA~Nga mantra-s of dakShiNAmUrti in this tradition are guru, gaNapati, durgA (or vanadurgA), kShetrapAla & sarasvatI and the uttarA~Nga devata-s would be bAlA ShaDaxarI, devI ShaDakSharI, svarNAkarShana bhairava, mR^ita sa~njIvinI & mahAmR^ityu~njaya. A third potentially independent tradition exists centered around the dakShiNAmUrti upaniShad which lists the medhA dakShiNAmurti, navAxari, aShTAdashAkShari, dvAdashAkShari (a variation of sAMba dakShiNAmUrti), anuShTup mantra-s. Though some dakShiNAmUrti-s are common in both of these traditions, the mantra-s differ along with the upAsana procedure. The common mantra-s among all three traditions are the medhA dakShiNAmUrti and the sAMba dakShiNAmUrti which also means that each of these traditions have unique dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s. It must be noted that, though sAMba dakShiNAmUrti is present in all three lists/traditions, the mantra and the dhyAna differ in all three traditions/lists. Similarly the navAkShara dakShiNAmUrti though found in the upaniShad and the Andhran tradition, both the mantra and the dhyAna differ significantly. The medhA dakShiNAmurti mantra is the only mantra which stays same in all these three lists without any variation. Other than these, one comes across mUrti-s like trailokya mohana dakShiNAmUrti and a different(from the one mentioned above) apasmAra nAshaka dakShiNAmUrti in some Andhran publications.

**shakti dakShiNAmUrti**

We will try to understand the role of dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s in ShaTkarma and the relative power/hierarchy of the deity’s mantra-s, by examining the contents of the mAlA mantra sUkta. The lakShmI dakShiNAmUrti mAlA mantra, which is said to be from the dakShiNAmUrti saMhita, praises the deity as “shrImat-tripura sundarI parisevita pAdAravinda yugalAya ” i.e. as one whose lotus feet, are served by the great shrIkula deity bAlA/lalitA-tripura-sundarI herself. The mAlA mantra of vaTamUlanivAsAbhidAna dakShiNAmUrti mentions “shrI shyAmalAMbA vINA gAnAsakta manaskAya” i.e. one who evinces interest in listening to the vINA gAna of (rAja) shyAmalA. One might be tempted to hold a view that the mAlA mantra of a deity having pada-s where other deities revere the main deity, as mere exaggeration or praise and one should not be naive to derive deity hierarchy from the same. While there might be an element of this, we will explore further to see why this not a mere exaggerated praise but does have a ritual basis. It can be said that dakShiNAmUrti is the R^iShi/seer for many shrI vidyA mantra-s and hence the pada-s like “shrImat-tripura sundarI parisevita pAdAravinda yugalAya” advances an opposite or a seemingly inappropriate sentiment. For this, it must be pointed out that dattAtreya is the R^iShi for few kArtavIrya mantra-s, even though the great deity kArtavIrya is a bhakta of dattAtreya, and hence there is nothing inappropriate or inconsistent as mentioned in the preceding statement. To explore further, we will move to a text which describes in great detail some of the high and mighty prayoga-s of one of the most-fierce of the dasha mahAvidyA-s. The shAkta tAntrika text when discussing a particular prayoga of this mahAvidyA mantra, mentions that to escape the ill effects (including mAraNa) of this mightly shAkta prayoga one has to resort to a specific dakShiNAmUrti mantra. It is said that the victim is to be given, water which is sanctified with the said dakShiNAmUrti mantra three times a day for a maNDala, to break free from the ill effects of the offensive mahAvidyA prayoga. It is one thing when a stotra says that the deity is served by other deities, but an altogether different thing when the primary text spelling out the prayoga details of a mahAvidyA, recommends invoking another deity with a specific mantra and vidhi, to counter it’s own destructive effects. Considering all the above together, one might appreciate the status and power of dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s relative to the mahAvidyA-s.

**ShaDbhuja dakShiNAmUrti**

On a related note, some of the complex [vidhAna prayoga-s involving mantra-s from the rudra prashna](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/2021/08/03/mahaprayoga-s-with-namaka/) are to be performed in the presence of dakShiNAmUrti, though only one gets listed in the post. Even the [Andhran muslim mAntrika, SA Sattar’s manual](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/2020/10/09/tantrika-practitioners-among-muslims/) has a quite unusual dakShiNAmurti mantra not for vidyA but for graha AkArShaNa and Avesha which is combined with hanumAn, bhagavatI and bagalAmukhI which goes thus: oM namo bhagavate Avayakhyi(vyAkhyAna?) dakShiNAmUrti shIghraM ra 9 shIghraM jvala 2 prajvala 2 guba 2 gabul 2 gada 2 gagaDagaDA shIghraM AkarShaya Aveshaya oM phaT svAhA. The context here, which is bhUta/graha nigraha and the league/group/type of deities that it is combined with, should be particularly noted.

The following is a \*\*secondary\*\* exercise i.e. the glory of dakShiNAmUrti is not dependent on the strength or lack thereof, of the following train of thought, but is indulged in, as a related and interesting examination/mild-polemic: While it is odd and not a necessarily productive exercise all the time, to derive the glory of a deity from works which are meant to praise a different deity, in this case, we will consider the lalitA sahasranAma whose primary goal is to praise lalitA-tripura sundarI, where we find a well known but a peculiar and a unique name, -dakShiNAmUrti-rUpiNI-. It is not dakShiNAmUrti sevitA or pUjitA or ArAdhyA but rUpiNI and does that give a hint of the high status of the deity? This can be compared with other names from the LS like mahAbhairava pUjitA, mArtANDa bhairavArAdhyA, kAmapUjitA, mantriNIparisevitA, kamalAkoTi sevitA, sachAmararamAvANI-savyadakShiNasevitA. This maybe objected to, by saying that LS also has the names kAmarUpiNI, viShNu rUpiNI and govinda-rUpiNI and hence dakShiNAmUrti rUpiNI is not special. To this, it must be pointed out that, though we have the names with rUpiNI suffixed for kAma, viShNu and govinda, we also have names as kAmasevitA and haribrahmendra-sevitA, but we do not have similar name for dakShiNAmUrti. It might be said, that dakShiNAmUrti is praised so, as the shrIvidyA system considers him as one of the generating-propounding teachers. This is true, but the entire gurumaNDala is covered already by the name gurumaNDala-rUpiNI, but yet special care was taken to include a name with dakShiNAmUrti. The other pakSha might retort now, saying that all forms of shiva are covered as indulging in worship of lalitA-tripura-sundarI, by the name shivArAdhyA. This is a name, that one finds in several sahasranAma-s, and not a visheSha (all LS names are special but not in the way compared to the nAma which is of interest to this exercise) nAma. The stotra-s of many deities or every second/third devI sahasranAma have names similar to shivArAdhyA, in addition of LS itself saying a new names further shivaGYAna pradAyinI i.e. one who grants shiva GYAna the ultimate goal to the deserving. The bhadrakAli sahasranAma also has the name “shivaprabhR^itisuraiH sevitA” i.e. one who is served by devata-s starting with shiva, even though as per the bhadrakAlI mAhatmya and other texts, bhadrakAlI is created by rudra. Hence the name shivArAdhyA of LS lacks the puShTi or force to say the deity lalitA tripura sundarI is propitiated by dakShiNAmUrti. A certain mAlA mantra of dakShiNAmUrti which is not covered above, also sees dakShiNAmUrti as mahAbhairava sevitAya, similar to LS. One might say, the vAgdevata-s ensured that the high status of dakShiNAmUrti is acknowledged even when praising lalitAMbikA, which is unsurprising given that, one of the dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s call him as vAgIsha (…vAgIshAya mahAGYAnadAyine…)

As we have seen that in the durgA bIja duM, dakAra is said to represent daxiNAmUrti while the ukAra is to represent umApati and the ardhachandra representing shiva himself, a mapping exercise between nava durgA-s and nava dakShiNAmUrti-s will be attempted. Both the nava durgA-s and the nava dakShiNAmUrti-s were revealed to grant specific phala-s to the upAsaka-s though forms of both deities extend beyond the number nine. This is similar to the various kAli-s (and other deities) meant to grant both bhoga and moxa to the respective sAdhaka-s. kanaka durgA can be seen as equivalent of laxmI dakShiNAmUrti, GYAna dakShiNAmUrti or vidyA dakShiNAmUrti paired with GYAna durgA. Due to intent of the mantra, giri durgA and saMhAra dakShiNAmUrti can be paired and in a similar fashion, shUlinI durgA and doSha (apasmAra)-nivAraNa dakShiNAmUrti are comparable, as are the pair of AsurI durgA and the trailokya mohana dakShiNAmUrti. In the shUlinI sahasranAma bhagavatI is described as “apasmAra mR^iga vyAghrI” i.e. shUlinI is like the Tiger which tears apart the Deer which is apasmAra. In the shUlinI sahasranAma we also have the name “deshikesha-hR^idAnanda-sampachchibukapeTikA”, where deshikesha means the Isha (rudra or lord) who is in the form of a deshika/teacher, which is dakShiNAmUrti. The name may be translated as “The chin of the divya rUpa of shUlinI durgA bhagavati is verily like a treasure-casket filled with Ananda which gladdens the heart of dakShiNAmUrti”. It is more appropriate to interpret deshikesha as dakShiNAmUrti instead of hayagrIva, with the first reason being that the shUlinI sahasranAma has another name “hayagrIva samArAdhyA”, and the second being the context and continuity, as the name occurs just before “sharabhAdhIsha-sambaddha-mA~NgalyamaNi-kandharA” i.e. shUlinI has mA~Ngalya tied onto her neck by sharabheshAna mahArudra. These names speak about the relation between shaiva mUrti-s and shUlinI. In the medhA dakShiNAmUrti sahasranAma, which is said to be from the chidaMbara naTa tantra, we have a name where he is described explicitly as vanadurgA-pati. medhA dakShiNAmUrti sahasranAma: “vArAhI pAlako vanyo vanavAsI vanapriyaH, ***vanadurgApati***rvArI dhArI vArA~NganA priyaH, vanecharo vanacharashshaktipUjyashshikhIsakhaH”. This becomes further interesting when considering the following shloka from the vanadurgA mantravarNAvalI stuti: “***me***dhA praGYAdi saMsiddhyai yAM sevante manIShinaH, sA pAyAt vanadurgA mAM ***me***kArAkShara rUpiNI”. Here vanadurgA is praised as one who is invoked among other things for medhA and praGYA vR^iddhi/siddhi, which is also the intent of the medhA dakShiNAmUrti mantra. This should be considered along with the practice of having vanadurgA as an a~Nga mantra of the medhA dakShiNAmUrti mantra in the Andhran tradition. The medhA dakShiNAmUrti sahasranAma also has two more names durgAmanohara and durgesha. As an aside, in the kAshmIrian tradition, nIlakaNTha mahAdeva\nIlakaNTha mahArudra is also referred to as durgeshvara and dakShiNAmUrti is said to be the R^iShi for the mantra of nIlakaNTha mahArudra. The text refers to the devata as shrI-durgeshvaro nIlakaNTho devatA.

Two dakShiNAmUrti yantra-s known in Andhra are appended below and third one from a Tamil text. It can be seen that in one of the yantra-s which is said to be skanda prokta, is inscribed a great unfailing weapon which has to be caught mid-air by nandin, when it was hurled against rudra himself. While the central mantra-s and the weapon might come across as of opposing dispositions, as mahArudra manifests in bahurUpa-s, this is nothing unusual. The phala that accrues from the dhAraNa of this yantra is described in superlative terms as below. mArkaNDeya uvAcha: “One who wears this dakShiNAmUrti yantra, which is prepared properly by someone who has complete siddhi in dakShiNAmUrti mantra-s, it is said, will become a mahAkavi, equivalent to bR^ihaspati, endowed with stable wealth, ever victorious, beautiful like kAmadeva, and equal to the sun in lustre. bhUta, bhetAla, yaxa, rAxasa and kinnara-s would run away on seeing one who wears this yantra. One’s enemies are turned into friends, kings become subservient, becomes endowed with eight kinds of wealth, one gets to enjoy bhoga-s like devendra, with wealth equaling that of kubera, and becomes victorious like kR^iShNa.”
