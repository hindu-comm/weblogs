***shrI laxmI hayagrIva charaNau sharaNaM prapadye***

The popular notion of hayagrIva along with mahArudra in the form of daxiNAmUrti, seems to be only as a deity that is to be propitiated by young students for doing well in academics and examinations. Even among those who are reasonably informed and are into sAdhana, the great deity is not given as much importance as should be. More specifically, the deity’s role in pratyabhichAra and ShaTkarmAdi siddhi is even less spoken/discussed. Post is meant to record the deity’s less known roles and the unstoppable power of hayagrIva mantra-s through anecdotes and texts.

An elaborate and interesting note by the AchArya, maybe referred to, [on the hayagrIva siddhi among the nAstIka-s.](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/notes-on-hayagriva-siddhi-among-the-nastika-s/) The hayagrIva upaniShad and the parAshara saMhita can be said to be the popular sources for the Astika hayagrIva mantra-s. There are other hayagrIva mantra-s that are available from unknown sources and it is unsure at the moment, if all these can be attributed to the hayashIrSha pA~ncharAtra. The shaiva bhUta tantra, hayagrIvaM and others are not discussed due to lack of information, other than listing them out through a [link to the AchArya’s post](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/26/the-primary-tantras-of-rudra/). The upaniShad is in the form of a dialogue between brahma and nArada, and it gives three shloka like hayagrIva mantra-s and two mantra-s similar to the daxiNAmUrti mantra-s with special bIja-s to manifest the correct devata, and ends by describing the lineage of transmission along with describing the glory and the phala accrued by the japa of hayagrIva mantra-s. Towards the end, one finds various deployments for the hayagrIva mantra-s which are to be suffixed or inserted appropriately. The first deployment is amR^itaM kuru kuru svAhA and is said to give the jApaka, vAksiddhi, shrI siddhi and aShTA~Nga yoga siddhi. A second viniyoga is with the ending sakala sAmrAjya siddhiM kuru kuru svAhA. A different version has additional deployments as vAksiddhiM kuru kuru svAhA, shriyaM kuru kuru svAhA. The viniyoga to make it rain or stop rain, are given as meghAnAM pravarShaNaM kuru kuru svAhA or meghAnAM nirvarShaNaM kuru kuru svAhA as done by the [nAstika siddha](https://youtu.be/dR8Ow-zhY5M?t=795) in recent times, with the [yamAntaka mantra.](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/07/23/the-samkshipta-bhairava-mantra/) There are about twelve or sixteen different forms of hayagrIva like laxmI hayagrIva, yoga hayagrIva etc, which will be for a later day discussion.

The effect of a proper siddhi or reasonable level of accomplishment in hayagrIva mantra-s or the hayagrIvAstra in specific, can be gauged from the following anecdote:. “An accomplished AchArya on encountering a powerful vaiShNava mantravAdin with considerable siddhi in two pA~ncharAtrika mantra-s which could scorch one, when asked for a mantra, advised him to seek a more suitable mantra teacher. The AchArya noticed that there was something quite unusual about the pA~ncharAtrika mantravAdin, and though was unable to place it initially, realized later that it was a hayagrIvAstra that was breaking down mantra kavacha-s of everyone else and inactivating certain yakShiNI-s and such an effect was witnessed only with a fierce abhichArika earlier.” Such a possible mAntric scenario is mentioned for example, in the kulapradIpa, in the context of enumerating the various reasons on why mantra-s might be rendered shakti-hIna, and it is pointed out that under a certain condition a mantra can become “trAsita” i.e. frightened. It is further explained that, as in the presence of the balavAn (strong one), a durbala (weak) becomes naturally trAsita i.e. terrified, the text adds that, when one indulges in japa of high and fierce deities like aghora-parameshvara and nR^isiMha, certain kShudra mantra-s, few yakShiNI-s and mantra-s like ArdrapaTI, become shakti-hIna, as they are frightened by the presence of these high and mighty deities/mantra-s. This note from the mantra shAstra text, matches with the above experience of the AchArya and we can add hayagrIvAstra to the list of deities, along with aghora-rudra and nR^isiMha. In a different context, another learned and accomplished AchArya of tantra, explicitly asked nR^isiMha upAsaka-s to not join a specific yaxiNI mantra shAstra class when filtering the students for suitability to the class. The reasoning given was that, the specific yaxiNI mantra-s planned for instruction in the class, maynot work in the intended way for those who are associated with nR^isiMha.

Some of the high prayoga-s involving a certain mahAvidyA, which cannot be countered by the standard go-to pratyabhichAra mantra-s from the shaiva, vaiShNava and shAkta streams, it is said, can be neutralized by hayagrIva alone, much like dakShiNAmUrti being the right deity to save one, from the effects of another potent prayoga involving a different but fierce and notorious mahAvidyA. So here we have both hayagrIva and daxiNAmUrti vidya-s capable of neutralizing the highest and terrifying prayoga-s involving mahogra mUrti-s among the dasha mahAvidyA devata-s. In another incident involving a mantrin who in the distant past, helped the rAjan of nepAl in countering abhichAra, is known to have countered an abhichAra on his daughter, by a combination of a highly secretive hayagrIvAstra combined with pratya~NgirA. On examination of the hayagrIva-mukha-mAlA-mantra which is part of a long mAlA mantra titled pa~ncha-mukha-hanumat-pratyeka mukha mAlA mantra, one can see that the deity is called for not just vidyA, but for the whole set of ShaTkarma and beyond, similar to the hayagrIva pUrva mAlA and uttara mAla. Beyond this, we have the mantra-s of hayagrIva combined with nR^isiMha for different purposes which are already mentioned elsewhere along with para jihva and paravidyA stambanaM etc.

While on the topic, one might look at the nAstika hayagrIva dhAraNI below to observe the different viniyoga-s:
