The introduction to the nIla sarasvatI tantra: Of the many forms of devI, the form of nIla sarasvatI is said to be of great importance. In kali yuga, nIla tantra is the best and it provides bhukti and mukti. She is [nIla sarasvatI](https://animeshnagarblog.wordpress.com/tag/nila-saraswati/), [tArA](https://shivashakti.com/tararas), ugratArA, ekajaTI

lIlayA vAkpradA cheti nIla sarasvatI, tArakatvAt sadA tArA sukhamoxa pradAyini, ugrApattAriNI yasmAdugratArA prakIrtitA

Due to her ability to grant vAk as a play, she is called nIla sarasvatI, while her ability to save by granting moxa and sukha gave her the name tArA. ugratAra is so called due to her ability to save one from terrible misfortunes. Elsewhere she is nIla sarasvatI as she is of the form of all languages sarva bhAShAmayI (and by extension her ability to grant her upAsaka-s knowledge of the same) and revered in all AmnAya-s.

**sAdhAraNa shAkta tilaka vidhi**: Either with rakta chandana (red sandalwood) or gopI chandana one is to make the mark of the devI’s astra (trishUla according to some) on the forehead. Then on the heart, one writes the tArA bIja and shakti bIja in the middle (navel?)

**Achamana vidhi:** This is not from the nIla sarasvatI tantra which prescribes a relatively simple method. Sip thrice with oM ugratArAyai namaH, oM ekajaTAyai namaH, oM nIla-sarasvatyai namaH. Wash hands with mAyA bIja, lips with vadhU and kUrcha. Clean hands again with astra. Cleanse mukha with oM vairochanAya namaH, right nostril with oM sha\~NkhAya namaH, left with oM pANDurAya namaH, right eye with oM padmanAbhAya namaH, left with oM amitAbhAya namaH, right ear with oM nAmakAya namaH and left with oM mAmakAya namaH, navel with oM tArakAya namaH, vaxa with oM padmAntakAya namaH, head with oM yamAntakAya namaH, right shoulder with vighnAntakAya namaH and and left with oM narAntakAya namaH.

**aShTa tAriNI mUrtayaH**: tArA, ugrA, mahogrA, vajrA, nIlA, sarasvatI, kAmeshvarI and bhadrakAlI (or chAmuNDA in a different version) are known as the eight mUrti-s of tAriNI, whose mantra-s it is said are formed by combining the mAyA, vadhU, kUrcha and astra differently. The significance of these aShTa mUrti-s is for an important nyAsa performed by the sAdhaka in attaining mantra tanu. tArA gAyatrI: tArAyai vidmahe mahogrAyai cha dhImahI tanno devI dhiyo yonaH prachodayAt. The version of tArA mantra popular among bauddha-s as the primary Green tArA mantra, it is said, is given out in the gAndharva tantra.

**tarpaNaM:** In a vessel made of gold silver or copper one is to take a mix of water, sesame, fruit juice, milk and axata, facing north one is to preform tarpaNa by uttering mUla mantra and saying tAriNIM tarpayAmi svAhA. After 3x tarpaNa one is to perform tArA gAyatrI japa followed by Achamana and aghamarShaNa.

For one meant to tread this path: strI nindA under any circumstance is to be avoided. One should not indulge in praise or ninda or other mantra-s. One may be tolerant of other mantra-s(or mantra systems) thinking that they too can give their respective results (to their votaries). Taking food from other’s house is prohibited and one is to refrain from bhUta hiMsA and pashu himsA, except when offering bali to devI.

When one comes across a fox, black cat, vulture, osprey one meditates on kShemaMkarI as “kR^isodarI mahAchaNDe muktakeshI balipriye, kulAchAra prasannAsye namaste shankara priye. If he sees a shava, he utters ” ghoradaMShTre karAlAsye kini shabda praNAdini, ghura ghora ravAsphAre namaste chitivAsini” and does pradakShiNa which would help in acquiring mantra siddhi. If he sees an upAsaki of tripurA in red dress and flowers, he does sAShTA\~Na praNAma and is to utter “bandhUka puShpa saMkAshe tripure bhayanAshini, bhAgyodaya samutpanne namaste vara varNini. If on the way, he comes across a black cloth, black sesame, a King, Princes, Elephant, Horse, Chariot, weapons of both kind i.e. astra shastra, soldiers, Buffaloes or kula guru he meditates on bhagavatI mahiSha-mardini by saying “jaya devI jagaddhAtrI tripurAdye tridaivate, bhaktebhyo varade devI mahiShaghni namostute”. On seeing a wine barrel, fish, meat, kula strI i.e. kula dravya-s and women having kaula dIkSha, he does a namaskAra with bhairavI smaraNa while uttering, “roga vighna vinAshAya kulAchAra samR^iddhaye, namAmi varade devI muNDamAlA vibhUShite, kulabhakta prasannAsye shankara prANavallabhe, karAla vadane shyAme namaste sura sundarI, rakta mAMsa samAkIrNa vadane tvAM namAmyahaM.” Such AchAra is said to provide the upAsaka with iShTa siddhi.

Even a lay observer cannot miss the contrast with respect to other mahAvidyA-s when it comes to details of tArA upAsana. There is a clear mix of bauddha elements which are more prominent in the Achamana vidhi. Based on which specific variation of tArA that one is intent on invoking, the nyAsa seems to take either the form of either akhilavAgrUpinyai, akhaNDavAgrUpinyai, brahmavAgrUpinyai, viShNuvAgrUpinyai, rudravAgrUpinyai, sarvavAgrUpinyai or ekajaTAyai, tAriNyai, vajrodake, ugrajaTe, mahApratisare, pi\~ngograikajaTe with both sets preceded by viyat+agni+AMAdi ShaT. The rudra nyAsa or shabda bhairava nyAsa as also many important nyAsa-s for tArA are preceded by the bIja traya whose combination is the tanu of mahAnIlasarasvatI.

On mahAShTamI one should, while uttering the tArA mantra perform 1000X homa with rice and bilva patra to attain the ability of enchanting speech. After performing tAriNI mahAmantra japa, if the sAdhaka also performs vAsudeva archana, he attains iShTa siddhi as also hari/viShNu sAyujya. On the tAriNI – vAsudeva pUja, the nIla sarasvatI tantra says:

mahAvidyAM cha saMdhArya vAsudevaM cha yo.archayet

prApnoti tatphalaM samyak harisAyujyatAM vrajet..77..

vAsudevo haro brahmA tAriNiM prakR^itistathA

ekamUrtiH sadA chintyA ekamUrtiH sadA sthithA..78..

The forms of vAsudeva, shiva, brahma, tAriNI should be conceived as if they are the same mUrti and not different. A shayanotsava is to be performed to tArA in AShADha, the parivartanotsava(?) in bhAdrapada and prabodhotsava(?) in AshvIyuja months. shukla pakSha aShTamI, mahAShTamI and in particular ghaTAShTamI as also the kR^iShNa pakSha chaturdashI of mAgha mAsa are said to be important days to invoke tArA. One verily attains raurava if they see a difference between devI, shiva and viShNu and hence should be seen as one. There is no pUja which is greater than durgA pUja, and no phala greater than durgA, no knowledge greater than durgA, and no tapas than (the one meant for attaining) nIlA (sarasvatI)

devI viShNu shivAdInAmekatvaM parichintayet,…na hi durgA samA pUjA na hi durgA samaM phalaM, na hi durgA samaM GYAnaM na hi nIlA samaM tapaH.

kadAchittAriNIM vidyAM durgAM tAraka tAriNIM, pUjayet kriyayA bhaktyA brahmavidyAM manoramAM..34.. sahasrAre mahApadme nIlakaNThaM sadAshivaM, brahmAdi gopyaM deveshI dhyAyechChaktisamanvitam…35.. Oh deveshI, one should have the bhAvanA that tAriNI vidyA, the tAraka tAriNI who is durgA as the beautiful brahma vidyA and perform pUja with a combination of appropriate kriyA and bhakti and (take her to, and combine her with) nIlakaNTha sadAshiva in the sahasrAra mahApadma, which is even hidden for brahmAdi deva-s. It is said that the sAdhaka should unite shakti and shiva as mentioned above and should perform nityA dhyAna of shiva shakti samaikya tattva. The mysterious mention of durgA (or even the specific durgottAriNI tArA) and her bhairava who is nIlakaNTha mahArudra in the kAshmIrian tradition is interesting.

**tAntrika – shAkta avadhUta:** shiva is avadhUta and so is shivA avadhUti. avadhUta Ashrama in the shAkta sAmpradAya is of two types. avadhUta who is gR^ihastha i.e. who is like a householder and the other is chitAnuga i.e. who is in shmashAna. A gR^ihasta avadhUta can wear clothes and he can have maithuna only with sva-strI. A chitAnuga avadhUta living in a shmashAna (like vAmA kShepa?) can be with para strI, and is without clothes i.e. digambara and indulges in aTTahAsa. There is a possibility of a deeper meaning here? While it might be so, it does not necessarily negate the literal meaning, for a few shloka-s before, it is explicitly said that indulging in maithuna with an agamyA strI can result in siddhi nAshana. na maithunaM agamyAsu kartavyaM siddhi nAshanaM!

Update on April 22nd: There are other mantra-s deployed in the pUja/archana of tArA which are homologous with few bauddha mantra-s and are to be found in practically every Hindu work on tArA. Thus one can see that tArA upAsana seems like a great confluence of shAkta, shaiva and bauddha streams, but primarily in a special shAkta frame work. Her aShTa mUrti-s includes shakti-s from her own tArA kula, kAlI kula, shrI kula and even sarasvatI. While there are other works which associate the aShTa sarasvatI-s i.e. antarikSha sarasvatI, ghaTa sarasvatI-s etc with her, together becoming 16 which seem comparable to the kAlI kula nitya-s and the shrI kula nitya-s? It is not without reason that the learned gaNapati muni in his dasha mahAvidyA sUtra on bhagavatI tArA said that “shabda-shaktistArA” – tArA is shabda shakti. “satyaviGYAna siddhaye tArAmupAsIta” – To achieve true viGYAna one should resort to tArA upAsana. gaNapati muni sought to perform upAsana of tArA after ambikA datta poetically mocked him in the debate about his unfamiliarity with tArA upAsana. Shortly thereafter, the muni acquired tArA mantra dIkSha from an upAsaka by name suresha mitra and indulged in fervent japa of the same. His last sUtra reads “tAropAsanAddivyaviGYAno bhaveddivyaviGYAno bhavet” – By tArA upAsana one attains divya viGYAna i.e. divine knowledge.

Updated April 23rd: An [extract from the life of vAmA kShepa](https://www.kalimandir.org/post/sri-bamakhepa-of-tarapith): “Bamakhepa was in the habit of moving around completely naked. One day someone asked him, “Why are you naked?” Bamakhepa replied, “My Father (Shiva) is naked; my Mother (Tara) is also naked. So, I am practicing that. Moreover, I don’t live in society. I live in the cremation ground with my Mother. So I have no shame or fear!” Under the guidance of his guru Kaliaspati Baba and the Tantric master Mokshananda, Bamakhepa completed all the major Tantric rites and sadhana in accordance with the *shastras* (scriptures).” – These statements of the tArA siddha puruSha are almost verbatim from the later part of the nIla sarasvatI tantra. See the paragraph of the shAkta avadhUta above. This arouses a suspicion if the rituals of the tArA pITha or the said siddha’s lineage, follow the nIla sarasvatI tantra.
