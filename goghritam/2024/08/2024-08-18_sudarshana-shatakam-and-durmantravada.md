The excellent sudarshana shataka is said to be authored by the vaiShNava yati and mahAmAntrika by name shrI kUra nArAyaNa jIyar. He belonged to the parampara of shrI ra\~Nga rAmAnuja jIyar in shrIra\~NgaM. He is known to be well versed in mantra shAstra and hailed as a mahAmAntrika. Some hold that he is shrI kUrattALvAn’s student. It is said that shrI jIyar visited kUrattALvAn when the later was staying the the great vaiShNava Alaya, thirumAlirunjcOlai–திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை known as azhagar temple which is famous among other things for the famous karuppaNa svAmi of 18 steps(Story towards the end). shrI ALvan supposedly asked what use would be of mantra shAstra to a bhakta like himself (ALvan). To which, the jIyar merely replied that it will be of use in those moments when it will be required.

The jIyar’s mantra shAstra prowess it is said, came to light when he used his mantra bala to bring back the boat used for teppotsavaM to the shore, when it was caught in the rapid flow of the waters of kAveri and was drifting away. In another instance, it is said that a certain durmAntrika entered the above mentioned famous vaiShNava Alaya by means of an a\~njana which rendered him invisible. With this invisibility the durmantravAdin stayed in the sannidhi of viShNu/sundara rAja perumAl and is said to be eating the anna that is offered as bali to the deity and indulging in the kala-apakarShaNa (i.e. taking away or removing the kala-s) of the deity. The great mantrin and sudarshana upAsaka shrI kUra nArAyaNa jIyar is to said to have noticed this and suggested mixing mustard powder to the rice being offered as bali. After eating the bali mixed with mustard, the eyes of the durmantravAdin started emitting tears unable to bear the pungency. This in turn made the a\~njana that is smeared to his eyes to make him invisible, getting washed away, there by losing his invisibility and getting caught, after which he was handed over to the appropriate authorities for punishment.

It would seem that the attacks from durmantravAdin-s on various viShNu temples in Tamil Nadu happened quite often during the medieval period and it is said that shrI kUra nArAyaNa jIyar made the pratiShTha of sudarshana-nR^isiMha in shrI ra\~NgaM with the exclusive purpose of warding off attacks (presumably to the temple and the staff/archaka-s) from durmantravAdin-s. A sudarshana-nR^isiMha pratiShTha was also made in recent times on the tirumala hill in the puShkariNi after a death due to drowning. The sudarshana shataka is composed as a stuti to this sudarshana-nR^isiMha in shrI ra\~NgaM. One of the elderly bhakta-s who was an arayar performing the seva to shrI ra\~NganAtha fell ill and could not be cured by any known methods and hence could not continue his service to the deity. On the request from elderly an elderly shrI vaiShNava lady by name shrI ANDALamma (shrI kUrattALvan’s wife?), shrI kUra nArAyaNa jIyar composed the mantra bIjAkShara ghaTita, sudarshana shatakaM, through the power of which, the elderly arayar recovered and was reinstated. The pArAyaNa of the shatakaM is said to grant shIghra phala, remove durita/dangers, granting wishes and removes bhUta preta pishAchAdi bAdha.
