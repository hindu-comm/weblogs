nIlakaNtha mahA-rudra, who is mahAdeva, seated comfortably on kailAsa in conversation with giri-tanayA pArvatI, gives the mantra of saMkarShaNa as follows:

The great mantra of saMkarShaNa is said to destroy sins arising from the manas, vAk and kAya (body), said to bring puNya and yashas/fame to the sAdhaka, in addition to granting vijaya in a saMgrAma.

***saM saMkarShaNAya namaH* सं संकर्षणाय नमः** – Is the pA\~ncharAtrika saMkarShaNa aShTAkShari as per GYAnArNava.

shiva RishiH, anuShTup chandaH , saMkarShaNo devata, bhR^igu with bindu is the bIjaM, namaH shaktiH.

kara and a\~Nga nyAsa with bhR^igu conjoined with the respective dIrgha-s (perhaps ending with bindu).

**dhyAnaM:**

sha\~NkhaM chakraM vahantaM musala mapi halam svaiH karAgrairdadhAnaH

pAyAt saMkarShaNo mAmarinivahabhayAdAmayAchchApamR^ityo

**मुक्ताशङ्खॆन्दु कुंद स्फटिक समरुचिः नीलवस्त्रॊ अरुनाक्षः  
शङ्खं चक्रं वहन्तं मुसल मपि हलं स्वैःकराग्रैर्दधानः  
नानाकल्पाभिरामः सकलजन मनॊभीष्टदॊ ऽति प्रसन्नः  
पायात्‌ संकर्षणॊ मामरिनिवहभयादामयाच्चापमृत्यॊ**

He is sparkling white in color like that of a muktA/pearl, conch shell or the kunda flower, is dressed in blue/black and with red eyes. He is holding the chakra, conch, plough and musala. He is most pleasing to behold, and is intent on granting the wishes of the sAdhaka. May that great saMkarShaNa, destroy my enemies and grant me protection from diseases and apamR^ityu.

pUja is to be done on a vaiShNava pITha

**AvaraNa pUja with puShpa and phalAdi:** prathama AvaraNa – Six a\~Nga-s. Second – keshavAdi 12, third – lokapAlaH

**For mantra siddhi** – laxa japa followed by homa with tila+trimadhura for appropriate number.

**kAmya prayoga-s:** After acquiring mantra siddhi, the mantrin might touch the yantra and perform 1000x japa on the same everyday for period of a mandala or an artha mandala to remove apamR^ityu doSha\*\*. The same procedure as above but with 2000x daily japa is to be done for jaya i.e., victory in a war, while a 3000x daily japa is suggested for acquiring a sAmrAjya.

**Yantra:** vR^ittaM, ShaTkoNaM, aShTa dala, bhUpura dvaya. The 8 varNa-s of the mantra in the aShTa dala, the sAdhya in the vR^itta and the a\~NgA-s in the koNa. Within the bhUpura dvaya, the praNava is inscribed all around.

The mantra and yantra for both the pUja and dhAraNa are popular for their ability to destroy sins and is said to grant the sAdhaka all auspicious things i.e. sarva saubhAgya, victory-vijaya, sthairya and dhairya.

-iti GYAnArNave vaiShNava pITha prakaraNe saMkarShaNa mantra svarUpa kathanaM nAma dvichatvAriMSha paTalaH – इति ज्ञानार्णवॆ वैष्णव पीठ प्रकरणॆ संकर्षण मन्त्र स्वरूप कथनं नाम द्विचत्वारिंशः पटलः

\*\* It must be noted that in the shAkta sAmpradAya, bhagavati kAla-saMkarShiNi’s mantra is popular for granting long life.
