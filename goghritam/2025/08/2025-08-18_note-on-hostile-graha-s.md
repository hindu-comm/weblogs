A brief note on the frequent pada seen in the bhairava, hanumAn and other mAlA mantra-s.

The term duShTa graha is any hostile graha in general. Here graha is something which seizes (a human or animal or a dwelling) with an intent to harm. Something which takes control of entities or spaces and indulges in taking over the resources and does harm to whatever it occupies. Traditionally a second meaning is also given which refers to graha-s/planets placed in an unfavorable position in the horoscope. One elaboration/expansion of the first meaning is graha can be any of the 18 or 27 types (as per Kerala prashna mArga) that are listed out in the texts. Alternately duShTa graha can also refer to harmful entities generated through abhichAra, though kR^itya is the most common usage for such an entity. What is sent by an enemy (para-preShita) might be usually accompanied by a set of beings that the entity is aligned with. Another type might be one that is in the retinue of some deities like for example kATeri/kATreri, a deity who is sometimes referred to as the beloved of shmashAna -rudra (…shmashAna rudra dayite…), though such an entity might eventually fit into one of the 27 categories elaborated below.

In the bauddha text Arya-graha-mAtR^ikA-nAma-dhAraNi (The Noble Dhāraṇī – The Mother of the Grahas), a dhAraNi and a bali vidhi is given to pacify both the celestial graha-s like suryAdi and also yakSha-rAkShasAdi in the same ritual. However, among contemporary bauddha-s, deployment of the bhUta DAmara vajrapANi seems to be a favored rite to bring various non celestial graha-s under control.

*In summary duShTa-graha can mean, one of the 27 types listed below, or one of the nine or more graha-s so placed in the horoscope to cause loss or harm, or a harmful entity sent by a rival mantrin.*

The following extract is from BV Raman’s book of Prashna Marga reproduced as it is:

  
“Stanza 61. — The spirits that trouble man are 26 in number. Of these 18 are powerful spirits and 9 are secondary ones. Stanzas 62 and 63. — Amara, Asura, Naga, Yaksha, Gandharva, Rakshasa, Heydra, kasmala, Nistheja, Bhasmaka, Pitris, Krisa, Vinayaka, Pralapa, Pisacha, Anthyaja, Yonija and Bhuta are the 18 Mahagrahas or great spirits. Stanza 64. — Apasmara, Brahmana, Brahma Rakshasa, Kshatriya, Vaisya, Sudra, Neecha, Chandala and Vyanthara are the 9 light or secondary spirits.  
PLANETS FAVOURING SPFRITS  
Stanza 103. — How these Grahas (or spirits) are connected with planets, what the houses of harm are, etc., have been explained in other treatises and they will be narrated here. Stanza 104. — The Sun governs Rudraganas, Ugradevas and Nagas; the Moon rules over Kinnaras, Yakshas and Graha Pisachas; Mars denotes Rakshasa Grahas and Bhutas, Bhairava Devatas, etc., Mercury rules Attala Grahas and Kinnaras; Jupiter governs Deva Grahas, Naga Grahas and Thrimurthees. Stanza 105. — Venus governs Yakshee, Matrus and Nagas; Saturn — evil ones as Nisthejas, Bhasmakas, Pisachas and Kasmalas; Rahu denotes Nagas, Pisachas and Serpents; and Ketu — Pretagrahas and Pitris. Diseases are caused by these Devatas indicated by planets occupying unfavourable positions.

NOTES  
The origin of all these 18 great spirits (mahagrahas) and the secondary or light spirits (laghu grahas) is traced to the wrath of Rudra, and they are brought under three distinct categories, the basis being, their motive. Actuated by Bali Kama (wishing to eat the oblations given) some attack the man ; some are actuated by the wish to indulge in enjoyment with the victim (Rati Kama), while a few have I their motive as the destruction of their victims (Hanthu Kama).”
