This is to record a brief note on some shaiva elements of bhagavatI Arya tArA. As a practicing Hindu the author would naturally find such snippets interesting and will be displaying some visible H bias.

In the Buddhist tArA mUla kalpa, there are rites which are performed in cremation grounds sometimes involving shava and Susan Landesman speculates shaiva influence here. In the uttara tantra i.e. later part of the tArA mUla kalpa, there is an explicit association of tArA with tumburu rudra, along with the chatur bhagini i.e. jayA, vijayA, ajitA and aparAjitA. Arya tArA is said to utilize a boat in her role as a savior and it is interesting that [tumburu rudra and the chatur bhagini are also conceived as being in a boat](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1678982039230455808) in the ocean. The bhagini are even called as attendants or messengers of tArA as much as jaya and vijaya being sakhi-s of pArvatI or even like the association of the bhagini with chaNDI or durgA. A Hindu might be even reminded of the vaidika mantra of the later deity, where the ask is to save one from the ocean like (with) a boat (…nAveva…) with the second mantra describing the deity as good savior (…sutarasi tarase…).

In the popular work on tArA which is called the 21 praises to tArA (tArA namaskAra ekaviMshati stotraM) which has few commentaries by both oriental bauddha scholars and occidental enthusiasts, we find two interesting references. The source of this stotra is the bauddha tAntrika work by name sarva-tathAgata matR^i-tArA-vishvakarmabhava-tantra translated as “The Tantra on the origin of all rites of Tara, Mother of all the Tathagatas”. This is an important work which gives critical instructions on the practice of bhagavatI Arya tArA which probably might be conducive to the siddhi of her famous dashAkShari and the associated ShaT (or more) karma vidhi. There are 21 popular forms of tArA in the bauddha traditions and the first 21 verses of this stotra call upon them.

The 15th verse calls her has “namaH shive shubhe shAnte…”. This is in praise to the 15th tArA who is mahAshAnti tArA whose main function is said, to “purify all mental and emotional defilements that propel beings towards the lower realms”. shive here does not seem to be just auspiciousness and might be a reminder of her shaiva associations? Understandably the Tibetan bauddha-s translate this (and also the 21st verse) as something else, much like few Southern shrI vaiShNava-s insisting that shiva is an adjective and not a reference to the name of the deity shiva/rudra in places where they find this problematic (to their agenda). If auspiciousness is only what is to be indicated, it is already done by the word shubhe and if the intent is to exaggerate or enhance the auspicious aspect of the deity, there were many other synonyms but shive was probably selected for a very good reason.(?)

The 21st verse is even more direct and addresses her as “namaḥ strītattvavinyāse **śivaśakti**samanvite..”. This is in praise to the 21st tArA called paripUrNa tArA i.e. tArA who makes everything perfect, with her main function being overcoming troubles due to graha, bhUtAvesha, vetAla and yaxAdi bAdha. Numerous bauddha translators display their discomfort here by translating this as “auspicious power” or “power of pacifying” or myriad similar meanings. [Warren Clarke did acknowledge the reference](https://somewarren.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tara_clarke.pdf) here to shiva and devI and tried to give it a creative spin without probably much success (to mean not many takers or not that convincing)?

However, considering the 21st verse in conjunction with the image of tArA as seen in the lineage of the bauddha sUrya gupta which is shown below, might help us understand better on why she is addressed as shiva-shakti-samanvite? Buddhist descriptions([on the web](https://www.lamayeshe.com/sites/default/files/21_praises_to_tara_6_texts_combined_1.2.pdf)), say she is seated on a bull which is “miraculously born”. While the author hasn’t examined the actual bauddha source for the image and the associated kathA, the description “miraculously born” gives an impression of something about it’s origin being masked.

A diagonally opposite scenario of bauddha elements in the Hindu tArA, might be gleaned from this [earlier post on the second mahAvidyA.](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/2024/04/21/tara-ekajata-nila-sarasvati/)
