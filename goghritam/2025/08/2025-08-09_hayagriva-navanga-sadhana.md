After Achamana with praNava, ramA and hayagrIva bIja-s one does the sankalpa to perform navA\~Nga sahita hayagrIva mantra japa.

The pUrva mAlA mantra, pUrva kavacha, mUla mantra japa, uttara mAlA mantra, uttara kavacha, hayagrIva pa\~njara, stuti, aShTottara shatanAma and the sahasra nAmAvali constitute the navA\~Nga-s.

This maybe compared and contrasted with the navA\~Nga sAdhana of some shAkta deities from the Kerala tantra tradition, which is significantly different from that of hayagrIva though both are referred with the same term called navA\~Nga. The dhyAna for one of the 9 a\~Nga-s already describes hayagrIva with shiva like features apart from holding a trishUla in addition to sha\~Nkha chakrAdi. It is possible that at-least one of the a\~Nga-s is extracted/preserved from some [bhUta or gAruDa shaiva tantra-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/26/the-primary-tantras-of-rudra/), with the second bhUta tantra named as hayagrIvaM. As an interesting aside, in some of the vaiShNava pratiShTha manuals, among the many nyAsa-s that are done on the mUrti, the nigama nyAsa has a reference to the gAruDa tantra-s and bhUta tantra-s.

oM garuDa tantrAya svAha – dakShiNa karNe, oM bhU(ta)tantrAya svAha – vAma karNe. My text says bhUtantra which is most likely a typo for bhUta tantra. Or it is possible that the original text which was consulted has the term bhUta tantra but later AchArya-s edited it as the context and significance of the term was lost and forgotten and the compound bhUta-tantra might have looked or sounded odd/offensive to perform nyAsa on bhagavAn’s (shrImat-hayagrIva-paramapuruSha-nArAyaNa) vAma karNa. Perhaps, this is one of the consequences of forgetting (or giving less importance) real deities and creating artificial deities from fictional characters, though on the flip side, it might have helped acquire critical support from the masses.

[Here is a link to an anecdote of an interesting and powerful experience](https://kellylightworker.com/hayagriva-the-power-of-mantra-part-2/) of subduing a ghost with the bauddha hayagrIva mantra. In the bauddha tradition, hayagrIva is especially popular for the power to subdue various kind of spirits/graha-s/bhUta-s which is an important aspect of hayagrIva and is for the most part, lost in the Hindu traditions though quite popular in the Buddhist circles.
