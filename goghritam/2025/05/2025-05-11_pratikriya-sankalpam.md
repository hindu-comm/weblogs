![A version of shUlinI yantra from Andhra](https://goghritam.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?w=631)

</div>

An Andhra mantrin was asked a theoretical question in a live session on who would win, in a mantra contest among two mantravAdin-s, where one is performing shUlinI and the other performing pratya\~NgirA. The mantrin did point out the theoretical & impractical nature of the question, but did answer that the pratya\~NgirA upAsaka would undoubtedly be the winner. While the mantrin’s answer will not be directly contested, there are a few things one may consider. First, among the bahurUpa-shUlinI prayoga-s (a term that will be used from now on, to indicate a specific class of shUlinI deployments) they do have a variant where shUlinI transforms into pratya\~NgirA or is invoked as pratya\~NgirA, which speaks much about the incredible “agility” of the vidyA. The deity (shUlinI durgA) is popular but not as popular as the other forms of devI, which the general public and to an extent even seasoned practitioners, find to be more captivating. Second, the variation of the deity in the form of pratikriyA shUlinI is paid even lesser attention relatively, which the [AchArya of MT refers to as a great weapon.](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/29/the-battle-of-the-train-and-bus-towns/) At least in the South, for many who are into the daurga-Agama, among the various nava durgA-s, it is the deity vanadurgA who is treated as a veritable-darling, with perhaps shUlinI coming in as second or third, even though the difference between the two is minimal/negligible. The vanadurgA mahAvidyA system coming as attractive packages like the vanadurgA mahAvidyA pa\~nchashati or the vanadurgA saptashati versions, is perhaps why it is appealing to many. The perception of nearly negligible difference between the two, draws strength from the utterance of the learned gIrvAnendra who mentions/quotes that that all prayoga-s meant for vanadurgA can be done with shUlinI and vice versa. Against this background, the sankalpa which is said in some traditions for the pratikriyA shUlinI deployment is shown below to give an idea of the prayoga-s which the great vidyA is invoked to nullify. One may take a note of the list of great prayoga-s which pratikriyA shUlinI is expected to handle.

A follow up question/thought can be, will a mere inclusion of a prayoga/deity name in the sankalpa imply that the deity is powerful enough to repel the apparently mighty and powerful prayoga-s listed below? In other words, will uttering a sankalpa to ward off an offensive involving a fierce mahAvidyA, for example, with a local mantra meant for viShamantra vAda, work? To answer this, two cases will be quoted. 1) In one tradition, or rather from a person belonging to one particular tradition, it was narrated that under \*certain conditions\*, a normal shUlinI durgA or vanadurgA might nullify an offensive aShTa mukha gaNDa bheruNDa nR^isiMha prayoga on it’s own, i.e. without a need for sampuTIkaraNa with other mantra-s. This can also be seen in the sankalpa below, which is coming from a different (from 1) tradition, that pratikriyA shUlinI is indeed expected to nullify a gaNDa bheruNDa prayoga. 2) A highly accomplished and a mighty tAntrika AchArya from the chera desha did mention on a certain occasion about removing an AbhichAra done with a certain mahAvidyA by deploying shUlinI (based on few other factors). So here we have a confirmation from a chera AchArya well versed in prayoga-s about deploying shUlinI to neutralize an offensive involving at-least one mahAvidyA. Given these examples, it is certainly possible that the pratikriyA shUlinI can neutralize offensive prayoga-s involving the other dasha mahAvidyA, which is also reflected in the sankalpa coming from a different (from traditions 1 & 2) tradition and is rooted in tradition and reality (as opposed to mere wish or fantasy). Another interesting detail is the intent to nullify harm coming from a nava chaNDI or even a shata chaNDI prayoga. Then there is the pratikriyA shUlinI digbandhana prayoga, which is different from the normal shUlinI digbandhana prayoga which seems to include two devata-s popular among jaina-s i.e. padmAvatI(?) and jvAlAmAlinI.

buddhimAndyAdi prayoga-s – Might refer to specific longer variants of bagalA or even other prayoga-s towards that end.

malayAla prayoga – Might refer to a class of mantra-s and prayoga-s named with the chera bhASha, though a perusal of standard publications (popular in Telugu lands) titled malayAla mantra-s shows that all mantra-s and yantra-s are in saMskR^ita. Examples like malayAla bhagavatI etc.

kakShapuTi prayoga – A probable reference to prayoga-s listed in the text called kakShapuTi tantra. Might also be a reference to prayoga-s listed out in texts like shrI bhuvaneshvarI mantra kakSha puTi.

bhetAla prayoga – Any of the various bhetAla prayoga-s like ugra bhetAla or shunaka bhetAla etc.

kuShThu and vraNa prayoga – Might refer to a specific vArAhI prayoga-s name kuShThu vArAhI and vraNa vArAhI meant to cause the said effects.

jAgrat svapna suShuptyavasthAsu indriya skhalita prayoga – This seems to be a prayoga which can cause indriya-skhalana (ejaculation) during sleep and even when awake. The effect resembles being seized by a mohinI?
