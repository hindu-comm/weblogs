devAmR^ita-varShiNI – देवामृत वर्षिणी

## Notes from pA\~ncharAtra texts –bhakti

Notes from pA\~ncharAtra texts:

अपराधाद्विनात्मानं बाधते यः सदा बलात्‌ ।  
तस्य पीडां प्रयुञ्जीत नैवं भवति किल्बिषी ॥

aparAdhAdvinAtmAnaM bAdhate yaH sadA balAt \|  
tasya pIDAM prayu\~njIta naivaM bhavati kilbiShI \|\|

When one troubles you with his his strength always, although you had
done him no harm, you may then attempt injury to him. This does not make
for sin. – An old/earlier vaiShNava pA\~ncharAtra text.

8 forms of bhakti according to pA\~ncharatra:

1)devasya ArAdhana

2\) samaya rakShaNa The preservation of the rule of the community

3\) Being faithful to devotee-s of viShNu

4\) Possessing the zeal to worship viShNu

5\) Self effort in trying to perfrom viShNu ArAdhana

6\) Hearing viShNu katha

7\) Not injuring others

8\) Not living by means of viShNu worship

The above markers of bhakti from the parama saMhita are more practical
compared to some elements of bhakti mentioned in the nArada and
shANDilya bhakti sUtra-s, which are impractical.
