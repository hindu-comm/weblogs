*The Woodstock Festival museum. Photo courtesy is [Woodstock.com](https://www.woodstock.com/the-bethel-woods-center-was-recently-voted-one-of-the-best-music-museums-in-the-country-by-usa-today-readers/). *

Did you know that the famous Woodstock festival of 1969, billed as “3 Days of Peace and Music”, did not take place in the town of Woodstock but in another town away from it? More importantly, do you know that the so-called counterculture movement of 1960s and 1970s, colloquially referred to as hippies, actually goes back to early 20th century even before the two world wars took place?

Richard Heppner chronicles the history of Woodstock as a small American town in the state of New York that witnessed the country traverse wars, economic development, and something of a spiritual awakening, in his book, Woodstock: From World War to Culture Wars (SUNY Press, 2024). While the world only knows the festival, Heppner brings alive the town and the unlikely history behind it. From being ultra-conservative to the extent that it voted Republican even when the country elected the Democrat Franklin Roosevelt to power in 1940 to opposing the Vietnam war a few decades down the line, Woodstock’s journey offers interesting insights about what we consider to be idealistic and realistic aspects of our lives.

The story of the town begins in 1902 when a former head of art department at Stanford University, Bolton Brown, was scouting for locations in the U.S to establish a utopian art colony. He was doing this at the behest of Ralph Whitehead, son of a rich British industrialist who had come to disdain industrialisation and the resulting economic inequality. Attempts to find an appropriate location in Oregon and California had failed already but New York’s Woodstock with its Overlook Mountain inspired both almost immediately. Whitehead had also hired Hervey White, a graduate of Harvard University, but eventually parted ways with him over creative differences. White established what he called the Maverick Colony, a home that hosted artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Eventually, this led to annual Maverick festivals which morphed into the Woodstock festivals.

At the same time, the town saw racial violence with members of Klu Klux Klan targeting not just African-Americans but also Jews and Catholics. The residents also rallied behind their government during the Second World War. They disliked the hippies immensely, who had already started showing up in significant numbers even before the famous music festival. Restaurants and cafes had sprang up to cater to the new customers but locals still resented their ways. Many hippies were habitual marijuana smokers, men sported long hairs and women had one too many piercings. The men flirted with the local women and nobody wanted their kids around any hippie at all. In one instance, unidentified locals burned their camps, tore their hammocks, and dumped their food supply onto the ground.

Yet, the hippies and town residents continued to live together despite their clashes. So when a music promoter Michael Lang was attending a music festival at the Woodstock Playhouse, he found himself longing for something much bigger as the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy (JFK’s brother) as well as the violence in Vietnam loomed large on his mind. He wondered, “how nice it was for someone to be sitting out under the stars in the summer, smoking a joint, and listening to music”.

Lang did manage to turn his idea into a reality but not in Woodstock, despite the name of the festival. It took place in Bethel, also in the New York state, which was 60 kms away from the town. It was attended by 500,000 people, according to some estimates, and went on for three days even as it poured down heavily. The images that came out of the event were nothing short of epic, with musicians and the audience braving it all for love and peace. If this sounds like a cliche, then you’re correct. It was very much so. For one, Lang conceived the festival as a profitable venture and the organisers sold tickets at music record shops across the country. But because they were not able to erect fences to keep off unwanted attendees, the festival became bigger than even Lang intended it to be.

But that’s not all. When more people started showing up in Woodstock looking for that festive spirit, they were often left disappointed by the ordinariness of the town which had about 5000 residents. They found there was no public restroom, psychedelic and recreational venues, or even properties for them to stay for a few days. Many left but some stayed. Who were these people?

They were the ones who put down their roots in the town. Bought a property, built a home, got married and started families, and attended their children’s parent-teacher school meetings. Unlike the hippies who were seen as escapists trying to evade any kind of responsibility and good conduct, these people considered themselves non-conformists seeking a different life. Their presence in the town began to shift its character when close to 600 marched in protest against the Vietnam war when a son of the town lost his life in the trenches. Today, the town still hosts many art festivals, from music to film, and is slightly less Republican than it used to be. Heppner writes that for a small town, Woodstock witnessed a lot in a relatively short period of time and this makes it the most famous small town in America.

Indeed, the story of Woodstock raises several interesting questions. To begin with, why do we desire utopias? What are the issues of a post-industrial society? Why did a rich kid want to establish an art colony in a foreign land? How did this endeavour devolve into the degeneracy of marijuana and promiscuity? If it was all meant to be so utopian, why did it turn into a commercial venture when things got bigger? What were the non-conformists really seeking in such a small town? How did the locals go through their ideological changes despite being so certain of their beliefs? Why are human societies constantly at war but also keep trying to get away from it?

The story of Woodstock reveals many of these answers too. Even before the advent of world wars, humanity had already begun to see the downsides of industrialisation. Where humans had previously lived in expansive landscapes, factories and grey skies had come to dominate the skyline of Britain. But while the ordinary Britons had to endure that as the reality of their life, a rich kid could afford to escape to untouched lands. This is precisely why the post-industrial society is distinctly different than its predecessors. It’s neither conservative nor liberal, it is defined by its pursuit of its material interests over everything else and it uses its monetary resources to achieve the same. It lays waste to the essence of both the conservative ideas of commitment, an honest and mutual give and take, and faith in a higher reality as well as the liberal ideas of personal freedom, humanism, and progress.

In Woodstock, both sides of the equations gained from each other— Whitehead and his group could have their escape home thanks to their money and the enterprising locals could make more money thanks to new business. Yet, both also resented each other. The “hippies”never really sought permission from the town locals regarding their project and the locals never really liked the new residents. The disregard was mutual and apparent enough. This is precisely the conflict that defines much of the 20th and 21st century issues of immigration, multiculturalism, MNCs, and global supply chains. Everyone wants more money and a better standard of living but no one wants to extend mutual respect and understanding.

And so, in this post-industrial society, the pursuit of emotional security becomes that much more fraught. While we do need it as human beings, the societal structure simply doesn’t allow for it as traditional structures of religion, community, and balance have broken down in our breathless race for material security. Our needs for higher beliefs, belongingness, and a sense of completeness have been thrown into a disarray as industrialisation continues to redefine the fabric of the society around the world. It leads to utopian colonies like that of Whitehead in order to have a semblance of that emotional security. But it mostly failed to achieve its objective. Why?

Because art is not about music, theatre, or paintings, but our ability to find the best in the midst of the worst. Since this is such an intrinsic human need, art has historically been patronised by kings but in the modern society it has become commercialised too. Instead of a public service, it has been turned into a privilege that few can afford to participate in and fewest can afford to practice. This is why we hang paintings in museums, rather than decorate our homes in beautiful colours and motifs inspired by nature as is the custom in traditional communities across the world. Or why we sell highly-priced tickets to a music concert rather than allow for street performances and free public festivals. And why there exists a museum called Bethel Woods that commemorates the history of the Woodstock Music festival and the musical legends associated with it. The museum charges $20 for an adult ticket to “experience what it was like”. We seek transcendence through art but do so in an ego-centric and consumerist way, a massive self-goal.

But this artistic utopia did lead to some positive changes in Woodstock. The non-conformists who became long-term residents of the town managed to strike a balance between their sense of freedom with that of responsibility. Once again, hippies were a distinctive feature of a post-industrial society which puts everyone on a never-ending rat race by default whether they want to run it or not. As important as material security is, many of us do not want to keep running the treadmill of the global consumerist complex. At the same time, it also fails to make space for those who might have something else to offer to the society— art, thought, or service.

This is relevant when we consider that when war came to Woodstock, the locals did introspect. Was the war necessary? The ordinary people anywhere never get a good answer to that question even if wars have been a part of the human society since time immemorial and will probably always be. Yet, we do find it disturbing and unnecessary. But where most of us never question the society or any aspect of it, including the government, it still needs to be questioned every now and then for the sake of our personal stability and survival. Which is why the non-conformists of Woodstock were important and how they helped the town protest the Vietnam War. Even if such protests come to nothing, as human beings we do desire to speak to our conscience, especially when it’s most necessary to do so.

Yet, decades down the line, the post-industrial society has become even more polarised. We have strayed too far from the meanings of idealism and realism in this age of global algorithms and instant gratification. This makes it more difficult than ever before to strike a balance whether individually or collectively. Mass media is constantly pulling our attention into events taking place far from where we are and crowding our consciousness with ideas that have nothing to do with us. At the same time we are increasingly disconnected from realities that we do live within and the hard work it takes to turn our ideas into a newer reality.

Here are some photos from New York City that I took when I was studying there. The first is from a photography exhibition about poverty, the second one partially shows a poster that says “war is not healthy for children and other living things”, and finally a man sitting on the road seeking donations with a board that says “lost everything but my hope and faith”. The Mecca of capitalism, New York City is also a melting point of humanity which can trigger many ideas but also shows many realities. But the exhilarating big city of New York is not so different than the small town of Woodstock where everything converged and in time, brought gradual change in one and many.

In March, spring brings with itself a taste of freedom. May it also bring the wisdom, courage, and clarity that we need to bring it to fruition for ourselves, our societies, and the world. But because the winter will roll around eventually, as it always does, may we ground ourselves in our realities just as much so that we’re not left out in the cold when the flight of freedom becomes untenable.
