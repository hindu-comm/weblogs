*A Wikimedia Commons artwork about Endymion and Selene, found [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Selene_and_Endimion_2.jpg).*

In 1818, the British Romantic poet, John Keats wrote the poem, Endymion, and the first few stanzas are a wonderful exposition about how essential beauty is for us as humans.

*“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:  
Its loveliness increases; it will never  
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep  
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep  
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.  
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing  
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,  
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth  
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,  
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways  
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,  
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall  
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,  
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon  
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils  
With the green world they live in; and clear rills  
That for themselves a cooling covert make  
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,  
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:  
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms  
We have imagined for the mighty dead;  
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:  
An endless fountain of immortal drink,  
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.  
  
Nor do we merely feel these essences  
For one short hour; no, even as the trees  
That whisper round a temple become soon  
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,  
The passion poesy, glories infinite,  
Haunt us till they become a cheering light  
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,  
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;  
They always must be with us, or we die.”*

The poem is Keats’ interpretation of the Greek myth of Endymion and Selene where former was either a shepherd or an astronomer and the latter was the moon as goddess. In Keats’ poem, Endymion is a lovelorn man who is looking for moon as a form of beauty and love but ends up taking an Indian maiden as his partner instead who is later revealed to be his moon goddess herself. But that’s not why the poet is renowned for the poem. Instead, it is for his gift in distilling the essential truth for us as humans— beauty as eternity.

Beauty, whether it is in the glow of the moon or the gentle bend of flowers as winds blow, is how Nature tugs at us to explore more of it. If a lion didn’t seem majestic in his beautiful mane, we would never have bothered to understand its shape or form and neither would we have known how many kinds of butterflies are there in the world (the answer is 17,500). We wouldn’t know of Fibonacci sequence or the Golden Ratio if we didn’t recognise that mathematical pattern that manifests as beauty in heavens and earth. We wouldn’t have built wondrous pyramids, temples, and churches around the world, if it wasn’t for the spectacular beauty that is revealed in a geometry of stones, canvas of colours, and the architecture that brings the two together.

What calls to us in form of beauty is a kind of an eternal divine impulse and humans since the very advent of civilisation have answered it in many, many ways. It is not for nothing that for Keats beauty is a joy forever because the poet was called to the same impulse, both in his observance and his poetry.

But what happens when we cease to answer to this impulse, preferring the familiarity of our smart devices, algorithms, and the many fractures in our perception caused by them? What happens when we are busy doomscrolling and fail to notice a bird being playful with her friends or a foreigner who doesn’t yet know of Google Translate trying to interact with us through gestures? What happens when everyone wants the same kind of “aesthetic” for their clothes, homes, and lives, foregoing the newer forms of beauty that come with answering the divine impulse with our hearts first and minds second?

Keats’ writes that we die without beauty and that might sound like an exaggeration but the fracturing of this ability to seek and create beauty does seem to be one of the biggest concerns today.

Beauty, in the modern sense, has been reduced to the image of it rather than also embracing the process of it. For in doing the latter, we see beauty as something much more than a vanity. Keats doesn’t write of that but surely he understood as much that beauty levies heavy costs, efforts, and consequences upon us. Building pyramids, for instance, was a behemoth of a task which cost many their lives. [Archaeological evidence](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14920131-100-pyramids-broke-the-backs-of-workers/) shows that those who dragged and laid the 2.5-tonne granite blocks making up the pyramids were condemned to an early grave, and they died with deformed bones and broken limbs. And neither has been our quest for the outer space been so safe with [NASA astronauts stuck in space](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/starliner-set-to-return-to-earth-without-sunita-williams-and-barry-wilmore-9541468/) for about three months now. Lions have often attacked humans and roses have thorns that can easily prick our fingers. Decorating a house may only require online shopping today but building one takes what it has always taken— blood, sweat, and tears.   
  
In other words, beauty is both the inspiration and reward of life. It gets us moving and having shown us the world, life, and ourselves, it becomes our joy. So it has always been and hopefully, will be.
