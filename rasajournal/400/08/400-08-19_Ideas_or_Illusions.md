*Illumination, photo by Garima Garg.*

Think about how information has typically flowed to us. In ancient times, it was probably through local grapevine or a travelling bard. Fast forward to the 17th-18th centuries, it was through letters, telegrams, and the newspapers were starting to show up. A century later, radio and television relayed news, entertainment, and game-commentaries. Half a century later, Internet too showed up and the world became a wide web. By the time a half of that timeframe passed by, we saw likes of Facebook crop up where you could keep in touch with just about anyone. Whether it’s a classmate from school you never spoke to or a colleague who is senior to you or a family relative, you could get updates about everyone. Finally, today we have instant messaging apps, free video calls, and of course, everything else that came before this.

The human mind, then, handles a lot more information today than it ever has. The speed with which the information comes at us, the quality and quantity of it, the context and the relevance of it— all of these have suddenly become important factors to consider which, until about 400 years ago, was absolutely not a problem. If you lived in Britain, were a part of upper class and a Christian, you wouldn’t have ever heard of a Hindu or an Indian. Or to flip this, if you were a Bengali intellectual, there was the slimmest chance that would ever get to exchange your ideas with an international counterpart. If you lived life as a transgender, you lived your life in a small community, and if you were an average householder, you still lived life within your small community.

In other words, human communities existed within themselves. Those who lived on the edges of the community, i.e., thinkers, artists, and spiritualists of all stripes, could communicate or move across communities but the masses remained right at the centre. With the advent of information revolutions, that has changed.

It wasn’t until The Enlightenment that the idea of enlightenment became commonplace. Or was sought to be made commonplace. Many figures from the time believed in the power of illumination of mind to rescue the human existence from its stagnation and depravity caused by centuries of religious orthodoxy, poverty, and corrupt monarchies. And so, began the love-affair with illumination in all its forms. Knowledge, intelligence, and the freeing of the human life from traditional shackles became the driving forces of much human activity. From the Industrial Revolution to secularism to democratic forms of governance, human society was reorganised in a radical way through ideas. But have these ideas now begun to outlive their utility, turning into illusions?

In his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), the French-Algerian philosopher Albert Camus wrote about the Greek fable of Sisyphus. A tyrant as a ruler, he angered the gods greatly who condemned him to live a pointless life. His task was to roll a heavy boulder uphill but the moment he reached the peak, the boulder would go tumbling down again. His hell was an infinite repetition of this task. For Camus, this was an allegory of modern industrial life. To go to work everyday, pay bills, and endure life’s meaningless endless ups and downs, was nothing short of the Sisyphean hell come alive. As an antidote, he proclaimed that we must imagine Sisyphus happy. That despite his hell, he has found meaning in it and we must endeavour to do the same. Interestingly, the most famous Camus quote explains his philosophy a lot more succinctly, “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”

Elsewhere, Hermann Hesse, the German-Swiss writer, who explored themes of spirituality and meaning in his works, wrote in his book, Narcissus and Goldmund (1930), “You learned men are arrogant, you always think everybody else stupid. One can be extremely intelligent without learning”. The book centres on two characters, one of whom is a learned monk, Narcissus, and the other a wandering artist and womaniser, Goldmund. It is the latter who utters this sentence to the former but it is the former who ultimately saves the life of the latter.

Living in the modern world, thinkers like Camus and Hesse were plagued by the lack of meaning in life. But why should have that have been the case? The world they lived in was undoubtedly far more enlightened, prosperous, and connected than their counterparts a few centuries ago. Where Camus encouraged people to keep finding meaning within their lives by sheer force of will, Hesse made the case that intelligence was a lot more than just learning. These two are related because in order to find meaning, one requires intelligence. To seek or create meaning, we need an objective appraisal of reality and then coming to some sort of acceptable narrative, rather than blindly internalising narratives fed to us by our external environment. Now where this dynamic can manifest itself at the simplest level, as with an ordinary individual whose intelligence and a sense of meaning rests in a particular deity, it can also manifest with thinkers like Camus and Hesse for whom meaning lies in ideas, self-expression, and critical thinking.

But does all intelligence lead to the same conclusion, i.e., we must continually renew ourselves internally, whether in terms of our faith or thoughts, in order to keep going in life? More importantly, can we always embody this? Hesse, for one, was [terrible at embodying the wisdom](https://aeon.co/essays/hermann-hesse-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-dwelling-on-ones-self) of his works and Camus never lived long enough to embody his Sisyphean metaphor. The arc of human experience through the ages and cultures shows that such insights or triumphant realisations are not enough for us. Why does the paradox manifest, then?

Intelligence by its very design is usually in awe of itself. It loves its brilliance and can never arrive at acceptance, humility, and understanding. It can only keep going further and further, building more and more fabulous worlds, with scant regard for reality of human character and life itself. Intelligence revels in complexity because that alone provides it the playground it needs to breed and express itself. This is true of both the common level intelligence as well as the savants in any field.

This tendency only becomes a problem in a culture that emphasises intelligence over everything else, as has been the case since The Enlightenment and becomes more so in the Artificial Intelligence age. The prophets of Artificial Intelligence movement like their predecessors also proclaim a new paradise on the horizon— with enough illumination or intelligence fed to the human mind, human civilisations will achieve a perfect state of material reality. Ideas like material progress, secularism, and equality still populate the mass intellectual’s mind now as they did three centuries ago.

At this point, the question worth considering is if the human civilisation put too much merit in ideas in the past few centuries and continues to do so? While ideas are the backbone of a civilisation, never has it happened that ideas have become the driving force for masses. The modern age, since The Enlightenment, has been a process of blurring the line between those on edges and those in the centre and Artificial Intelligence seeks to entirely eliminate it. This means that many of the modern ideas are warped beyond recognition in the common understanding, leading to illusions masquerading as enlightened ideas.

Camus’ Sisyphus, for instance, is a popular meme template on social media. More commonly, ideas like feminism, class inequalities, religious fundamentalism, and the like are often discussed without adjusting for the contexts of people on either side of a nugget of information. The barriers of differences of our groups— in terms of cultures, nations, religions, classes, and like— as well as the differences of our capacities— for intelligence, honesty, wisdom, prosperity, hard-work, risk-taking, artistic insights, and the like— have all been flattened out by our digital screens and trending algorithms. This means that the possibility of meaning has been effectively flattened out while the idea of it remains a seductive illusion.

The information revolution of the past few centuries believed at its heart that with the right knowledge, resources, and freedom, everyone could be whoever they wanted to be and that was in fact the highest goal for everyone. However, what has actually happened is that the information overload has shunted our capacity to reflect and introspect about the ideas that we take to be the gospel truth. At the same time, it has convinced us of the virtue of intelligence over all others without any consideration about its limitations and paradoxes.

Sisyphus, today, is busy posting for likes and engagement, while rolling that boulder uphill. We cannot imagine him happy because he is not creating meaning, he is consumed with instant gratification of information, connection, and validation.
