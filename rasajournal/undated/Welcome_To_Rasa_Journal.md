Hi and Namaste!

The idea here is to find the rasa, or the juice, in all aspects of culture in India— be it arts, popular culture, socio-political dynamics, and so on— through the lens of the country’s past, present, and potential future. This rasa permeates the countless subcultures of India, across its many regions, states, union territories, and of course, the global diaspora.

Rasa Journal is non-partisan, non-ideological, and not focused on the mainstream media model of cycling through current affairs and controversies. Instead, it seeks to present an objective, slow, and thoughtful journalism to those interested in all things Indian. The reportage here is aided by extensive research as well as turning over the proverbial mic to people who have demonstrated expertise for a topic at hand.

It would be great to connect with you on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasajournal) or hear from you at \[rasajournal@gmail.com\] about anything you’d like to share.   
  
Hope you hop onto and enjoy this ride with me!
