### [bAvari in the land of theassakas](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/bavari-in-the-land-of-the-assakas/)

May 15, 2011

The sutta nipAta, which is the oldest of the bauddha Pali texts gives a  
remarakable account of the brAhmaNa penetration  
of southern India. A brAhmaNa named bAvarI lived in srAvasti in the realm of the  
ikshvAkus prior to the time of the  
buddha. He is said to have borne 3 marks of a great being and was a purohita of  
the ikshvAkus and a teacher of the  
prince. He however, lost interest in his comfortable position and sought to  
become a recluse teacher. He along with his  
students travelled to dakkhinApatha and entered the realm of the horse tribe,  
the assakas (ashvakas). Their land lay in  
the basins of the godAvarI and the mUlaka (mULa) rivers. The rAja of the  
assakas was a certain andhakarAjA, who gave  
the bAvarI a plot of land for a 1000 coins. bAvari and his team lived here  
subsisting on roots and fruits. They encouraged  
the settlement of a large village of local in their vicinity. By visiting this  
village bAvarI and his students collected a large  
amount of offerings from the village and conducted a great vedic sacrifice.  
After that he was apparently informed by a deva  
of the coming of the Buddha. Now in his previous janma bAvarI was supposed to  
have been the yadu king kattavAhana  
who ruled north of those regions.

Who were the assakas of the godAvari region? Being the horse tribe they were  
clearly the megalithic horse men of the  
vidarbha region whose archaeological sites are extensive from the 800-600BC.  
They appear to have spread from here to  
the entire southern penisular country. Now the deities of the of pastoralist  
tribals of south India are all horse riding  
deities similar to the assakas. Further the mahAbhArata alludes that the abhirAs  
overtook the yadu realm after the  
intercine killing and the fall of dwAraka. Now the same abhirAs and other  
pastoralists of peninsular India called gollas,  
yadavas, abhirAs etc associate themselves with the yadus. The name of the king  
of the assakas andhakarAjA is also a  
yadu name, so also is kattavAhana. It may hence be reconstructed that after the  
fall of the Indo-Aryan yAdavas their  
native mercenary cattle breeders gradually took on the yadu paraphernalia and  
expanded southwards. By 800 BC they  
appear to have formed the powerful assaka state that had alread assimilated many  
elements of the Indo-Aryans, probably  
including prakrit and some elements of the Aryan religion. They still  
predominantly maintained their own deities, who were  
now depicted in horse borne form. They may have also transfered the names of  
some ancient yadu heros, like kArtavIrya,  
to their deities. This may also explain certain tamil ruler claim decent from  
the yadus of dvAraka. They probably were in  
reality descendent of the assaka complex. However, the fact that bAvarI had  
reached their land and instituted brAhminical  
practices suggests that the brAhmin presence was probably carried to the Tamil  
regions directly with the expansion of  
these megalithic people. Hence it is no surprise that the earliest Tamil  
literature already shows a brAhminical influence.

\> Is assaka \< azvaka or asmaka? Many history books give only the latter  
\> name. Since some Prakrits comtemporary to Pali confuse the palatal and  
\> the dental sibilants, \<asmaka\> could be later hyper-sanskritisation of  
\> assaka. What do you think?

I could come up with the following:  
OIA\>Pali/Pkt  
vismarati\>vissarti (forget)  
rashmi\>rassi (rein, hindi: rope)  
So we have a very occassional sm/shm\>ss. Hence theoretically asmaka can give  
rise to assaka.  
However, there is some evidence to support your proposition that asmaka was  
reconstructed back from Pkt by using  
templates like rashmi or vismarati. There is another ashvaka tribe that lived in  
the NW. They were a sub-branch of the  
kambhoja, aNu lineage and are called as such in the Pauranic sources. They are  
refered to as the assakenus by the  
Gandharan Greeks. But the later writer asanga terms them as asmakas, suggesting  
that he reconstructed it from assaka  
into asmaka.

In the Hathigumfa inscription one line is said to state that khAravela sent a  
large army westwards to strike terror amidst  
the assakas. This confirms the position of the assakas of bAvarI. Apparently  
this was an out flanking operation to prevent  
the assakas from making common cause with the draviDas attacking kalinga by sea.
