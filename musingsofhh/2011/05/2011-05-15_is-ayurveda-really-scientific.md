### [Is Ayurveda reallyscientific?](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/is-ayurveda-really-scientific/)

May 15, 2011

This report on the downgrading of Ayurveda raises the important issue  
of whether Ayurveda is really scientific. If we define Ayurveda as the  
school Hindu medicine that is described in the charaka and sushruta  
saMhitas then one can make a very direct textual analysis to establish  
its scientific content. Even a casual reading of the sushruta  
saMhita suggests that it can definitely be considered a serious  
part of the Hindu scientific tradition even as Galen and Hippocrates  
can be considered a legitimate part of European scientific tradition.  
Ayurveda is merely a phase in the long line of development of the  
Hindu medicine from the time when the Aryans were still in the Asiatic  
steppes to the time of their conquest of Outer Asia. Roots of Hindu  
medicine traced through the atharvan-Angirasa literature can be pushed  
back to the common Indo-European period resulting in similarity with  
basal Greek and Europic folk medicine. However it was only after the  
Aryans had fully expanded in India that their pharmacopeia developed  
to the extant seen in Sushurta’s saMhita. This continuous tradition of  
Indian science shows remarkable ideas and hypothesis even in the  
Atharvan period, followed by remarkable insights into physiology due  
to the school of the vaisheshika sage panchashika asurAyaNa and  
sulabhA. In sushurta’s treatise we can see a scientific treatment of  
the following: 1) Diagnosis and description of disease and relevant  
anatomy. 2) Theories of disease causation due to biological organisms  
and 3) Parasite transmission. While much of this shows a remarkably  
modern approach to the problems thus making ayurveda qualify as a work  
of science. However like any other work of science it contained  
concepts that might be falsified in the future- leading to them being  
termed misconceptions. There were two devasting flaws of Ayurveda: 1)  
the trihumoral theory and 2) the hypothesis of pulse diagnosis. While  
this falsification of the underlying hypothesis for treatment may have  
destroyed Ayurveda’s relevance it actually did not. Much of  
pharmacopeia development is an emprical process and the AV and  
Ayurveda excelled at this. Thus a significant part of Ayurveda’s  
pharmacopeia may have relevance even today. However, I feel for  
Ayurveda to re-enter the scientific mainstream it must adopt the more  
modern theories of physiology and medicine and cut down the  
frivolous aspects of pulse diagnosis. Hence we need to defend Ayurveda  
along with the necessary ground work to revamp it and bring it back  
to the mainstream. Keeping it where it froze in the 8th century AD and  
insisting on the unnecessity of change may make it go extinct. Nor is  
it keeping with the spirit of the great Hindu sages of yore.
