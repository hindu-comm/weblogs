### [“vedic” worldview?](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/vedic-worldview/)

May 12, 2011

\> A major problem with those who criticize these sciences  
\> is a LACK of understanding of the “Vedic Worldview”.  
\>  
\> Vedic Worldwview if Brief: There is “something” within us  
\> that gets projected as our physical body, the same “something”  
\> projects itself as the physical universe. Now the real cause  
\> of any event is not in the physical plane but in that  
\> “something”. The past is remembered within this “something” and  
\> we call this memory of past within this “something” as  
\> accumulated karma.

Dear Sir,  
with all due respects I have to take very strong objection to this.  
This in no way can be called a Vedic world view. I strongly object to  
the word Vedic being appended to every other thing in order to give it  
a false sense of sanctity. The concepts that you mention are merely  
one of the philosophical opinions that are prevalent in classical  
Indian philosophies. While the Vedas proper have different  
philosophical ideas, they do not subscribe to the notion of karma and  
the atman as a imagined by some later Indian philosophies. These ideas  
themselves are Indo-European in origin (Though some lateral middle  
Eastern Influence cannot be ruled out) but they are essentially  
para-Vedic. Only very late in Indian history (Post-bhArata war) did  
they have some interaction with the vedic stream. advaita, panchratra  
etc are not vedic in sense of the word. They only twist some vedic  
ideas to give legitimacy to themselves.

atman is related to the Germanic word Atem and goes back to a PIE word  
that probably meant life supporting breath. The vedic AtmA was closer  
to this and not to that seen in the later texts. So your concept  
should be correctly termed the medieval Hindu world view and not the  
vedic world view.

Similarly vedic astrology, vedic mathematics, vedic management and  
vedic numerology are phantoms of the modern Hindu mind.

How would you explain the term in Cha_ndogya Upanis.ad in relation to  
\> soma: a_tma\_ yajn\~asya? Ain’t this concept of a_tman Vedic?

Well if you interpret the way the later day advaitins and other  
vedantins did then you may think that the chAndogya was refering to an  
AtmA in the sense of the soul. However, if we carefully look at in the  
vedic context we can see that even in a text like the chAndogya of  
the late kuru realm the AtmA concept meant something totally different  
from the vedantic interpretations of later days (I never said AtmA  
concept is not vedic, it not just vedic it is even PIE).

To illustrate this point we consider the famous tale of the dialog  
between the kekaya king and the 5 brAhmaNas- prAchInashAla,  
satyayagnya, indradyumna, jana and buDila (5.11-16). The vaishvAnara  
AtmA is identified in the entire body with its brain, eyes,  
respiration, trunk and excretory functions. Thus the AtmA is metabolic  
process that permeates the entire body rather than being a something  
whose projection is the body.

sa ya eShoNimaitadAtmyamidagaM sarvaM tatsatyagaM sa AtmA tatvamasi  
shvetaketo iti \|\| ChU6.9.3/4

Here again the AtmA is described as the common principle of life  
existing in diverse forms like the tiger, lion, wolf, boar, beetle,  
firefly, gnat and mosquito that said to be able to repeatedly  
propogate themselves.

\> Bra_hman.a-s are karmaka_n.d.a-s in the Vedic tradition. So how can  
\> it be said that karman is not Vedic?

The brAhmaNa protion should definitely be treated with greater  
circumspection than the saMhita as they are more prone to insertions  
and conflation of various intellectual streams.

Shri Reddy,  
your mails have been confusing, nevertheless what you ‘vaidika’  
friend writes is largely incorrect. I have said this many times on  
this list but am just incited to state it against once more:  
Unfortunately, despite all their education a large number of Indians  
do not understand the foundations of linguistics. The unity of IE  
languages and the inference of PIE are not going to go away how much  
ever you may whine or bitch. The IE languages are more related to each  
other than to any other languages- period. If you are not willing to  
function within this framework your theories and models are erroneous  
and need not be taken seriously for historical reconstruction.

A corollary to this is that traditional methods of understanding the  
vedas have suddenly become inadequate as they do not take into account  
the powerful methodology of comparative IE linguistics and mythology.  
Through IE lingusitics and mythology we understand the vedas a greater  
depth than it was ever traditionally possible both in the historical  
and the religious sense. So if you all are missing out IE issues then  
you are the losers as you not understanding your heritage correctly.

The undiscerning fellow will insist that the sun revolves around the  
Earth and say that he see ‘proof’ for it. If you want to be in that  
state fine, there is no point having a dialog with such souls.

btw the mantra that your fired quotes na karmaNA na prajayA…  
is not a real vedic mantra. It is a late creation superimposed  
erroneously into the upanishadic texts by those who never grasped the  
spirit of the vedas.

Ask you friend why the taittiriya U says: prajAtiramR^itaM AnandaM  
ityupaste

\> It is true that one can arrive at a better understanding of

Bhadraiah what is the difference between the above and below?

I am sure you are meaning something subtle but I do not understand it.

But if by understanding the veda you mean their religious philosophy I  
think the comparative information does help us a lot. Many of my  
family members and myself perform rites the same way Hindus have been  
doing them for hundreds if not thousands of years. There is no change  
here but the reasons why we still do these rites and the significance  
is only reinforced by the new knowledge. To give you an example the  
term ojas represents a concept that needs to be ‘sensed’ to understand  
some philosophical issues. Comparative studies show us the link with  
the words like augos in Latin and aukhutai of the Shaka that helps us  
to understand better the sense of this word in its original  
application.

\> Apologies for my sweeping statement, and my respects to all the  
\> serious scholars. Your examples prove that vedic type rituals  
\> existed in other parts of the world. (Is aukhutai related to Ahuti?)

Well, apologies for a little typo: aukhatai, Avestic Aogah, Sansk.  
ojas, Latin augus, Greek Auxein, english wax are all homologs.  
Comparative analysis suggests that the word meant not just strength  
but a in sense fertility as expressed well in greek auxein or wax. So  
the presence of these cognates helps to sense the meaning is say a  
vedic mantra like:

mahAnindro ya ojasA parjanyo vR^iShTimAniva of vatsa kaNva \| stomair  
vatsasya vAvR^idhe \|\|

This tells me how given the fact that parjanya/vR^iShTi and the verb  
vAvR^idhe are used I must understand the term ojasa as in all  
likelihood the great kANva had meant it. The raw might of indra is  
combined with his ‘fertilizing’ effect as the showering parjanya and  
indra expands his might pleased by the sacrificial pouring of vatsa.  
The IE comparative analysis helps me in my religious matters of  
appreciating the many faceted implication of ojasa as represented by  
the english word wax/Gk Auxein, latin augus.

Paralatai, Aukhatai, Traspies and Katiaroi are the castes of the  
Scythians. Aukhatai as the warrior caste preserves the military aspect  
of the meaning of ojas.

As an aside Paralatai is a cognate of paradAta of the Avesta and may  
sort of be an analog of purohita and prefaectus

\> algorithmic nature of the ritual can not be minimalized as some form  
\> of ‘worship of fire’ or treating indra as cloud. Message-board  
\> hardened IE scholars should collide headon with the subject or get  
\> out, instead of insulting native vedic scholars just because the  
\> latter are not so sophisticated in their objections.

I am neither a message-board hardened IE scholar nor a vedic scholar-  
my profession lies is an entirely different domain. As brAhmaNa I have  
some familiarity with 3 saMhitas suffient to take me through basic  
sacrificial rituals I need to conduct over my life. Additionally have  
read throught the texts for a few other saMhitas, I have never made  
claims of any scholarship native or IE.

I completely agree with you that indra is much more than a cloud and  
even much more than a war god or an atmospheric shot, and worship of  
agni much more than fire worship. But all this is for those amidst us  
who are practicing Hindus. Most indologists are not practicing Hindus  
but we need not reject their findings wholescale due to that. We take  
what is relevant for our purpose and leave them alone as long as they  
are not trying to destroy our religion. Our rituals are largely an  
internal matter- so if the Indologist give us some insight but does  
not really understand other aspects of the ritual- so be it.

To cite an analogy: The Moslems have harmed Hindus and their religion  
in the worst ways. Because of this should stop eating Zilebia,  
Jahangiri, Roti, some paneer dishes etc? At least I am not prepared to  
do so.
