### [The pravargya ritual](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/the-pravargya-ritual/)

May 12, 2011

The pravargya is an exalted vedic sacrifice performed by an Arya to  
the ashvins and offers a glimpse of the fusion of the two ancient  
ritual streams of the ancient Aryan past. One component of it is the  
ancient gharma rite to the Ashvins probably instituted by the bhR^igus  
under the great atharvan chyavAna. ChyavAna was revived from  
decrepitude and disease by the ashvins and went on to win sukanya the  
daughter of shAryAti and accordingly in their honor offered the great  
sacrifice of milk. Then the bhArgava dadhichi, gained the madhuvidyas  
from the ashvins who had fixed on him the head of the horse, hence he  
worshipped them as the gods of medicine. These ancient memories  
resulted in the atharvans instituting a sacrificial pouring for the  
Ashvins with the mantra AV 7.73 (Shaunaka SaMhita of AV,  
samiddhoagnir…). Simultaneously in the Vedic stream of the bhAratas,  
the school of the prAjapatya vAishvAmitras instituted a rite to  
commemorate the twelve month year also known as prajapati, with a  
twelve day pouring two the deities: savitA, agni, mAtarishvAn, the  
Adityas, the nakshatras, the R^ita, dhAtA, bR^ihaspati, mitra, varuNa,  
indra and soma. The end of the year was marked symbolically by the  
beheading of prajapati by rudra. The restoration of his head in the  
new year was through the surgery of the ashvins.

The myth of the cephalic surgery on prajapati and dadhichi served as  
the fusion point of these rites during the early settlement of the  
bhAratas in the sub-continent. This resulted in the pravargya rite in  
which marks the restoration of the head of yagna or the prajapati also  
called makha’s head in the brAhmaNa literature. Thus the taittiriya  
AraNyaka states:  
te devA ashvinAvabruvan.h \| bhishhajau vai staH \| idaM yagnasya shiraH  
prati dhattameti \|…  
The head in the pravargya rite is symbolically denoted by a parvargya  
pot. Thus is the rite performed:  
The adhvaryu first set up sacrficial fire and offers ghee to savitA.  
Then he mixes clay and makes the pravargya pot with an hour glass like  
shape with a spout in the top half from three pieces of clay. He also  
makes the other chamasas and the ladles for the rite with the  
remaining clay. They are sun dried and then the adhvaryu fumigates  
them in a fire fueled by horse dung. Then they are heated in the fire  
in the sacrificial pit taken out and cooled by the pouring of goat’s  
milk. On the day of the rite the adhvaryu uses his forceps to hold the  
pravargya pot over the AhAvaniya fire and melts ghee in it and the  
prastotA priest sings the pravargya sAmans during this process. The  
pot is then place on a raised altar on a silver disk. Ghee is poured  
again into it and its heated by the adhvaryu and then surrounded by  
samids and covered with a gold lid and a fire lit. It is fanned with 3  
fans till the pot becomes redhot and all except the yajamAna’s wife  
look at it chanting yajushes. Finally the other participants leave and  
the pratiprastAtA priest and yajmAna’s wife not looking at the pot  
chant the fertility yajushes to tvashTa. Then a goat and a cow are  
milked and the milk is poured into the pravargya pot. It is then held  
by tongs and taken to the AhAvaniya fire and the gharma offering to  
the ashvins is made. An indra pouring with the formula “svAhendrAya  
svAhendrA vaD.h” is made and the milk is made to overflow from the pot  
into the fire. The pourings to pUshaN and rudra are made. Then after  
performing the agnihotra and worshiping the prANa as indra and agni  
with the formula “prANa evainaM indratamegnau juhoti” the yajamAna,  
his wife and priests eat the congealed milk of the gharma with honey.  
The adhvaryu then disposes the sacrificial implements used in the  
rite: the forceps, the tripod, the fans, two fire pokers in the east  
by arranging them in the shape of a man. The prastotA priest sings the  
rakshoha sAmans during the process. Then singing the shukra samans,  
the yajamAna, his wife and the priests dispose the pravargya pot on  
the east on the west sides of the uttaravedi platform. If he desires  
to slay his foes he lays a death-dealing charm invoking  
agni-vaishvAnara and disposes it on the branch of an audumbara fig  
tree. He may also dispose it near a termite heap with darbha grass for  
successful farming.

Also finally the soma while not directly offered in the Taittiriya  
AraNyaka form of the rite, it was possibly originally present as in  
the soma offering of the bhR^igus to the ashvins. A relic of this is  
seen in the pavamAna sAmans sung in course of the rite.

Now the issue is that the pravargya pot is a very distinctive  
structure that necessarily must appear in the archaeological record.  
Especially given the gold/silver base and lid of the pot finding such  
structures may be possible. I would like to hear from list members  
regarding any pottery that may fit into the parvargya apparatus and  
their possible dates and associations. Is there any such material from  
Kalibangan for example? Sankalia mentions some pot associated with the  
Malwa culture would anyone have details on it?

Interested readers may also consult: J Houben, J Gonda and J  
Buitenen’s works on parvargya. Houben’s is a good brief summary with  
English translation. Buitenen’s interpretations of the rite are in my  
humble opinion completely flawed. Gonda talks of psychic effects of  
soma, and ghee drinking in the rite…. But i doubt these were really  
relevant.
