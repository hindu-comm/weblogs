### [Talageri’s analysis of theRigVeda](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/talageris-analysis-of-the-rigveda/)

May 15, 2011

Shri Talageri’s work is indeed provides the first major model of Aryan  
origins within an OIT framework. Importantly Talageri destroys the  
scholars with a consistently flippant attitude towards the vedas. He  
decimates Michael Witzel, D. Kosambi the buddo-communist and the Arya  
samaj brand of scholars. The result is a very solid work on R^ivedic  
history many points of which are likely to hold good for a time to  
come. The Iranian connection of the kANva angirasas is quite  
undeniable given the names like medhathiti, priyamedha and medhya.  
This gives us a critical direction to understand the milleu within  
which Zoroasterianism, i.e Mazda worship arose- it was within the  
fold of the Anu. Thus the origins of Iranian were within Indo-Aryan  
and not as an equal level sister group of it. Furthermore Talageri,  
quite convincingly demonstrates the association of the R^igveda with  
the pUru mainstream. The good part of his research is that unlike many  
OITists he argues within a linguistic frame work. Many OITists  
persistantly make a fool of themselves by rejecting the monophyly of  
IndoEuropean languages and some times even lingusitics itself. He  
rightly maintains that Linguistics is a very solid historical science  
unlike what some people imagine. He also does not labor under the false  
notion that nothing can be ‘proved’ by lingusitics. However, a  
careful analysis of his work reveals some problems. I shall detail  
these over time.

I do not intend to negatively criticize or attack Shri Talageri’s  
research, i am just raising issues that need to be addressed.

Who was divodAsa of the R^igveda?  
One of the prominent rulers of the R^igvedic horizon was divodAsa and  
Talageri rightly identifies him as associated with the bharadvAjas.  
Talageri calls him a pUru. This is supported by the observation hymn  
RV I.130.7 by parushcchepa daivodAsi that identifies him as a pUru.  
Yet when one looks at the Aryan regnal genealogies we get:

divodAsa as the 49th king in the pUru lineage- successor of bhArata in  
the ajAmiDHa line. Talageri identifies divodAsa as an early period  
king.  
3 generations after him we get sudAsa, sahadeva and somaka in  
succession identified by Talageri as belong to Middle an Late period.  
So is the entire R^ig compressed into this little window with no other  
king’s names surviving in the list?

Now if we look at the kAshirAja dynasty that emerges from nAhusha but  
not yayAti and pUru we get the kings:divodAsa and pratardana some way  
down this dynasty about 7-8 generations from nahusha. Thus this pair  
of divodAsa and pratardana are the most likely ones mentioned in the  
R^igveda. Formally they are not pUrus but nAhushas. None of the  
correspondng pUru rAjas of that period mentioned in the R^ig  
suggesting that main activity of the early R^ig composers occured in  
the patronage of the kAshi dynasty.

Similarly if we correctly trace the descent of vishvAmitra from  
pururavA through amAvasu and jAhnu we get him to be contemporary of  
jamadagni that matches the corresponding generations in the bhArgava  
tree. Furthermore we also get him as a contemporary of trishanku of  
the ikshvAkus with whom he is traditionally associated. Hence the  
original vishvAmitra of the RV maNdala III is not a bona fide pUru as  
stated by Talageri. There is one corrupt genealogy in the mahabhArata  
that supports Talageri’s claim but it is an anachronism in every other  
respect.
