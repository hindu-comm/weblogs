tatsama and tadbhava in dravidian languages

It should be noted that many of the examples that were given as tadbhavas in  
dravidian tongues are actually mere  
transfers from the southern Prakrits. So they may appear as tadbhavas with  
respect to sanskrit but are tatsama with  
respect to the parent prakrit. To give an example tamils say: khAyaM (wound). In  
sanskrit it is kshata. So it appears  
tadbhava in Tamil (S. dravidian). However, if one examines prakrits both  
northern and southern one finds the following  
forms: Pali: khata, Prakrit1:chaya Prakrit2: khaya. So Tamil is actually tatsama  
with respect to the neighboring prakrit.  
These prakritic forms are seen even in northern areas (even central Asia) that  
have no detectable dravidian substratum.  
Hence these forms arose independent of Dravidian. The observation that most of  
the tamil borrowings (beyond the  
“brahminical terms”) are from MIA rather than OIA support an initial fringe  
(and/or) late contact between the IE and D  
worlds in India. This fits very well with the mahArAshTri prakrit area being the  
zone where the (originally hunter-gatherer/  
pastoral- like the Gonds) Dravidians formed the syncretic megalithic horse  
culture along with the prakrit speakers of more  
northern origin. This culture then moved south to establish the old Tamil states
