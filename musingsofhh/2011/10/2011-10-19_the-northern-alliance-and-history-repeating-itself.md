### [The Northern Alliance and history repeatingitself](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/the-northern-alliance-and-history-repeating-itself/)

October 19, 2011

Following was written in Nov. 2001:

The current events in A’stan have an uncanny resemblance to some very  
less known events in Central Asia that affected India’s history in a  
significant way. I just felt that I must post this as there may be  
lessons to be learnt from this in today’s context. After having  
smashed many Indian rulers, Shihab-ad-Din Muhammad Ghori, the Afghan  
Sultan, decided to settle scores with his Northern neighbor Muhammad  
Shah of Khwarizm. In 1204 AD Ghori marched on Muhmamad Shah with a  
large force to seize territory north of the Amu Darya. His forces  
were strengthened by the mercenaries and cannon-fodder (there were no  
cannons then) he had acquired from the Ghaznavid territory of Punjab  
after he had taken over that. Compare this with the struggle between  
TaliPaks and the NA of today (Literally the descendents of these  
respective parties). Ghori routed Shah on the banks of the Amu Darya  
and marched into Khwarizm. The great Mongol ruler, the Ghur-Khan of  
the Qara-Kitai, had excuses to open hostilities with the Moslem Ghori  
as his troops had executed buddhist merchants (In return the Ghur-Khan  
had some Mullahs nailed to their mosque doors). The Khwarizm Shah  
Muhammad who was his vassal saw a great opportunity in this, and  
humbly approached his suzerain, the Ghur-Khan, to make common cause  
against the Afghan Sultan Ghori who was now marching straight into  
Central Asia (A superpower, and the NA make an alliance!). The  
Qara-Kitaian Mongol cavalry was sent forth under their able commander  
Tayanku-Taraz who defeated Mhd. Ghori near Hezarasp and Shah got to  
occupy the territory. Then, the Mongol cavalry trashed Ghori in a big  
way in Andkhoi, west of Balkh and sent him fleeing into India with all  
his entourage. Here, he was of course killed by the the Khokars in  
1206. Soon aided by the Mongol suzerain of his, Muhammad Shah seized  
most of A’tan starting from Herat, then Ghor and finally Ghazni. This  
ironically drove the whole Ghorid clique into India to take shelter in  
Delhi with their agent Qutub-ad-Din, who invited them with open hands  
and used them extensively in India in war against the infidels. The  
most prominent of the hordes that migrated in this event was the  
Khalji horde- one of the biggest nightmares we have ever seen in our  
history.

The fleeing TaliPaks of today being redirected to India is a real  
dangeras the Ghorid agents in Delhi. Also note the western press until  
a few days ago was waxing eloquently about the Afghani invincibility.  
The true superpowers of the past ages- the Mongols on two occassions  
and Timur-i-lang, have thrashed them badly. So after all history is  
repeating itself- is it not ironical that even the USA has to follow  
the footsteps of the Kha’Khans of yore (from Baghdad to Balkh)!
