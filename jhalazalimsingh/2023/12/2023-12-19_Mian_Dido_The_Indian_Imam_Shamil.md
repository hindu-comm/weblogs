**Early Life**

Mian Dido's lineage is traced back to Raja Hari Dev of Jammu, who reigned from 1650 to 1658. Hari Dev's fifth son, Dalip Singh, inherited the jagir of Jagati, located about ten miles north of Jammu in the hill forests. Mian Dido, born in March 1780 to Mian Hazari who was fifth in descent from Dalip Singh. He purportedly played a role in defending Jammu during Hukma Singh Chimni's attack and even managed to successfully defeat a Sikh unit kept in reserve near the Bahu fort. As his reputation for heroism grew, freedom-loving youth from Duggar joined his ranks, making him a formidable force that controlled the inner mountain territories from Riasi to Basohli.

Joined by prominent Rajputs such as Mian Dharam Singh Raipuriah, Mian Ch’affu, Mian Chain Singh Hansaliwalah and even zamindars and Marzbans of talluqas adjoining Jammu, like Puro Drorha, Mian Dido terrorised and disrupted the Sikh administration to such an extent that they found it difficult to realise revenue from the region.

The Gulabnama describes him thus

> Mian Dido, a gallant and valiant man, took to highway robbery on > account of exuberance of chivalry. He had commenced plundering and > pillaging villages around Jammu. Moreover, he would often enter even > Jammu and fight with Sikh troops. Every one who encountered him was dispossessed of his life and property. Such a course caused immense disorder in administration……Whoever got wounded at his hands could not survive

**Sikh Invasions**

As Maharaja Ranjit Singh brought Jammu under his control and Jammu Raj was gradually annexed to Lahore kingdom of which it became a district under the direct control of Sikh officers he faced a wave of resistance, particularly the Jamwal and the Sambyal clans. As early as 1810, uprisings occurred in the Jammu and Samba regions with Mian Dido leading the rebellion in the hills of Jammu and Mian Dewan Singh in the Chenab valley. As a result Diwan Bhawani Das launched an expedition and briefly managed to drive out Mian Dido and secured control of the town in July-August 1810 and established a thānā at Saidgarh but to no avail.

The area was then given to Prince Kharak Singh as a jagir in 1811 and a multitude of expeditions were launched to suppress the rebellions. These were commanded by his Peshkar Bhayya Ram Singh and Diwan Bhawāni Das Kuba (hunch back) assisted by a number of experienced commanders like Nain-Singh Kumedan, Fateh-Singh Man, Diwan Shankar Das Dugal, Dondi-Khan, Diwan Kirpa Ram Chopra, Sardar ‘Atar Singh, Mohan Singh Sud, Narain Das Pashoaria, Ghasita Mal Arora, Devi-Sahae and Lala Dana Mal.

*Painting of Prince Kharak Singh*

Ganeshi Lal too provides a description of Mian Dido’s activities

> “a petty Jagirdar of Jugtee had not, however, allowed a peaceful > possession of his new conquests and was always plundering the country with a large gang of followers, killing the Sikh officials and functionaries and in short, had given Ranjit a great annoyance and trouble.”

They employed numerous strategies including capturing local leaders and imprisoning them in Shekhupura fort. Some of these were subjected to brutal punishments, like Jara Langeh, accused of sheltering Mian Dido, who was summoned to Jammu by Diwan Bhawani Das and had his stomach incised on mere suspicion alone. Despite these brutal tactics failed and the Dogra rebellion persisted as it is put by the Gulabnama

> “(*Gives a long list of Sikh commanders*) …who arrived continuously with large troops, found themselves helpless in that affair.”

A newsletter dated 15th December, 1814 (2rd Zihaj, 1229 A.H ) depicts the situation of Jammu when Ranjit Singh questioned Bhayya Ram Singh and Kanwar Kharak Singh about the district of Jammu.

> “Ram Singh replied that ‘disturbance and unrest prevailed there’. Reinforcements might have been despatched but things could not be improved. >
> On 26th August, 1815 Bhayia Ram Singh had to state that ‘the condition of the district of Jammu was the same as before.”

**Mian Dido’s rebellious activities**

Such was the fear inspired in the Sikh ranks by the Dogra commander Mian Dido that even the 2,000 strong garrison of Jammu was powerless against him as he entered the city of Jammu setting fire to the city and making off with its movable property with a band of no more than fifty or sixty men. On other occasions, he entered Jammu at dusk with no more than two to three hundred men, while the garrison went into hiding offering no resistance whatsoever. The Dogras slaying any Sikhs they encountered would then proceed to spend the night around fires in the Mundee (town square), cooking their meal before leaving at dawn, taking whatever valuables they wanted facing no opposition whatsoever. During one such raid he fell upon the Sikh troops encamped at Mandi and nearly burnt down the entire place before vanishing with the same suddenness as he arrived, with the Khalsa unable to lift a finger to stop him. Anyone wounded at the hands of the Dogra warrior had no hope for survival.

Scarcely did fifteen days elapse without the occurrence of such exploits with legend saying that Dido had personally dispatched over three hundred of his Sikhs adversaries to the other world. Eventually, the dominance of the Dogra rebels in the region became so absolute that any Khalsa army member venturing beyond the Derah to answer the call of nature seldom returned and the Sikh troops refrained from pursuing the rebels beyond a gunshot's distance from the walls of their forts.

**The Hawk Incident**

In the year 1811, Mian Dido captured an exceptionally fine hawk bringing him into conflict with the Sikh authorities of the region who considered the bird their property. When they demanded he hand over the bird, Mian Dido refused to give over his prize prompting a Sikh force of twelve men and an officer being detached to retrieve the bird forcefully.

The contingent reached Mian Dido's abode, where he and his wife were the sole residents, situated approximately sixteen miles from Jammu, in close proximity to the revered Trinokur (Trikota) hill from where he had initially captured the hawk. After their demand to surrender the bird was made Dido suggested that he accompany them to the Durbar at Jammu along with the hawk in order to reach a settlement. When the Sikh contingent agreed to Dido’s proposal he asked for some time to prepare for the journey. Feigning hospitality he then proceeded to provide the soldiers with the raw materials to cook their meal in a small area adjoining Dido’s hut. While the Sikh troops were thus occupied Dido asked his wife to go into hiding in the forests nearby along with the hawk through the door at the back of his hut. Having thus ensured his wife’s safety he drew his sword and fell upon the unsuspecting invaders killing seven and mortally wounded four of them with only two of the original thirteen managing to escape.

The fiery spirit of resistance is well-reflected in the baars or ballad of Mian Dido

> “Mian Diddo hurled his challenge on the enemy. >
> He asked them to clear out of his land, >
> and mind their own “Lahore and Májhá”. >
> Mian Diddo fell upon the enemy with his sword >
> and stuck their heads to the “Garna” bushes.”

**Daring Escapes**

Twice, did the Khalsa forces manage to apprehend the rebel leader, only to witness his daring escapes. On one occasion around the year 1812 Mian Dido, perhaps weary of his rugged lifestyle and enticed by promises of pardon from Sikh authorities in Lahore and Jammu voluntarily gave himself up to his enemies. However, sensing signs of treachery, he fell on his captors and made his escape, killing five men from his escort in the process.

On the other occasion the Mian was imprisoned by the Sikh forces through trickery. However one afternoon Mian Dido, under the pretext of answering nature’s call went to the privy, only to flee after striking the head of his lone captor with the vessel filled with water.

The situation of Mian Dido is aptly described in the Gulabnama

> “Yet the Mian Dido affair aggravated day after day. The sword of his valour sent a panic in the Khalsa army; and the more bloodshed they perpetrated the more up flared the fire of rebellion. The war-like Rajputs showed no fear of the authority of the Khalsa government.”

**The Proverb**

As his strength grew, Mian Dido intercepted a 'dali' of dry and fresh fruits sent by Pandit Birbar Dar to Ranjit Singh at Lahore and replaced its contents with pathuas (cakes) made of cow-dung and filth. Upon reaching Ranjit Singh's presence, the porters reported the incident, stirring his sense of honour.

*Painting of a royal procession of Maharaja Ranjit Singh on an elephant followed by sons Kharak Singh and Sher Singh on horseback*

As Ranjit Singh contemplated action against the rebel, a Dogra in his service by the name of Gulab Singh interjected, recounting a proverb about a fierce lion disturbed by a mouse nibbling at his whiskers when he was asleep. This man would eventually go on to write history playing a vital role in the Khalsa Kingdom before eventually founding his own dynasty. The Gulabnama of Diwan Kripa Ram describes the episode thus

> At this the Sarkar's (Ranjit Singh) sense of honour was pricked so > that he started brooding over taking steps to suppress his rebellion. > At that time his Lordship (Gulab Singh) submitted, “There is proverb > that a fierce lion was once asleep when a mouse nibbed his moustaches. The lion made several inroads to take revenge on him, But because of its smallness he could not lay his hands on it. He therefore became restless and gloomy. >
> A cat, becoming aware of this affair said to the lion, ‘With all this > prowess and valour confined in your nature it would be below your dignity to seek quarrel with such a trifling thing having no ability to equal; and in fact no lionine valour is needed to take action against it. If this meek cat is allowed she may possibly chastise it.’ >
> The lion thus considered the worth of the cat a divine aid and > promised that if she relieved him of that anxiety he would set apart a > portion of flesh for her maintenance. As a mouse is a cat’s natural hunt so she killed it in no time. In the same manner if the work of doing away with Dido is entrusted to this humblest of the humble servants, it will be readily accomplished.”

Amused by Gulab Singh's eloquence, Ranjit Singh bestowed upon him the pair of shawls he was wearing (Khilats) and appointed him to lead the expedition against Mian Dido, accompanied by the Sardars Atar Singh Kalal, Jagat Singh Atariwala, and other prominent chiefs.

The tremendous impact of Mian Dido’s successful guerilla campaign can be ascertained from the ‘qabuliat’ for jagirs bestowed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to Mian Kishora Singh and his family (Mians Gulab Singh, Dhian Singh and Suchet Singh). The qabuliat for the jagirs has a few clauses which included maintaining 400 service troops, protecting the road to Kashmir and to “either capture the recalcitrant Dido or kill him or force him to cross the river Sutlej” in return for the jagir.

The “Qabuliat” reads:

> “W-Dido mutmarrad-e-badkesh ra asir Karda hazir sazem weya-bKusham w-ya az darya-e-Sutlej abur Karda Khwahem dad.” >
> “and we undertake either to capture and send to the presence, Dido, the recalcitrant, or kill him or drive him across the river Sutlej.”

**Gulab Singh’s Strategy**

Gulab Singh who was a native of the region had earlier gained experience fighting in the terrain when he attempted to supress the rebellion of Mian Diwan Singh and his son Bhup-Dev at Riasi in the years 1816-17. When the rebel attempts to seize the fort of Riasi from Zorawar Singh (the legendary Dogra General who would later conquer Tibet) were repulsed they joined Mian Dido in raiding Dansal.

On receiving information about enemy presence at Dansal, Gulab Singh immediately headed for that place with a contingent of 200 warriors. The difficult and mountainous terrain full of thistles prevented the troops from using horses to traverse the distance. Speed being of essence Gulab Singh led his men on foot without rest in the darkness of the night. He managed to reach the neighbourhood of Dansal with “two watches (*gharis?*) of the night” remaining.

But the rebels had already left the area so Gulab Singh offered chase without a moment’s delay heading in the direction of Thanda Pani and Mat’havara located in the Dron pargana (the Dron pargana was the region around the Trikuta hills). The rebels had been resting in the house of the ‘maqaddam’ of the region namely Sahib ray Brahman.

Gulab Singh and his men managed to reach the spot by mid-day and managed to take the rebels by surprise. Confronted with an unexpected force the rebels made their way through the mountain passes they knew at the back of their hands with Mian Dido escaping to the Bahr Bani wala and Bhup-dev heading towards Sarothal. Gulab Singh who had developed blisters in his feet from the arduous marches relentlessly continued the pursuit of Bhup-dev and his men but failed to apprehend him after they hid in the mountain passes.

Despite his failure in the engagement it gave Gulab Singh vital experience and offered him a close look at the challenges encountered while facing rebels in a mountainous terrain. The Gulabnama vividly describes how Gulab Singh led by example and the hardships he endured

> “As whole of the Lordship’s attention and valour had been directed > towards the suppression of enemies, he thought that cooking(*time > consuming and the smoke might alert the enemy*) might retard the undertaking so he contented himself with eating half-parched wheat picked up from harvested fields. Not stripping his weapons off his body he used to sleep, ready for action, all the time. >
> Such were the wonders of courage and endurance of his Lordship that all through the period of suppression of disturbances and uprooting of rebels which exceeded a year, he went to the battle everyday, and never removed his weapons from his person even at night.”

The Gulabnama mentions two of Gulab Singh’s engagements with Dido in this earlier campaign. The second engagement involved a skirmish with Mian Dido and his men in the Dron hills where gunfire was exchanged for two hours. Eventually unable to hold their ground the rebels retreated to the hill-tops.

We can also conclude that he learnt vital lessons from these engagements with rebel forces. These experiences probably prompted him to later invent the “Parmar” musket. These were long matchlocks supported on a light forked tripod attached to the stock that could only be carried by a strong man. These were extremely effective and deadly weapons with a considerable range. He is also crediting with inventing a small gun made of iron, which was mounted on a small carriage (drawn by a man or by a goat) for hill warfare.

*Possible Illustration of what the Parmar musket invented by Gulab Singh looked like with its “light forked tripod attached to the stock”*

**Inducing Defections**

Thus drawing on his past experiences, Gulab Singh brought fresh vigour into the campaign against Mian Dido and his band of rebels. He reinforced the already two thousand strong Jammu garrison with a body of five to six hundred more men. Being a relative of Mian Dido’s and having engaged the rebels previously in battle, Gulab Singh was well versed in their tactics and knew that military might alone was not sufficient to defeat them. Thus he recoursed to stratagem and used his wiles and spent large sums in bribery inducing rebel leaders to defect.

Furthermore, he had released from the Shekhupura fort several leaders such as Mian Cha’ffu and Mian Diwanu among others as a symbol of goodwill and an assurance of mercy to those who surrendered. Thus when Gulab Singh moved to Jammu, several of Mian Dido’s accomplices including Puro Drohrah (who had fought the rebels in the Riasi campaign before joining Dido) deserted his side and tendered their submission to Gulab Singh. The services of other former rebels like Mian Dharam Singh Raipuriah were actively used against Mian Dido as well.

*Painting of Raja Gulab Singh*

**Cutting of supply lines and popular support**

Like any guerilla, Mian Dido relied on the local populace for supplies, moving from village to village, would announce his presence, prompting villagers to prepare and deliver food out of fear or sympathy. Warnings to the villagers by government forces failed to break this cycle.

Hence to cut off the local support he received and corner him by stretching his supply lines Gulab Singh came up with a clever strategy/ruse. Whenever Gulab Singh and his men entered villages they would mimic the style of Mian Dido's approach, and inform the village leaders that Mian Dido had set up camp outside, requesting provisions. However, when the zamindars brought food, they were swiftly apprehended and taken to task for attempting to supply rebel troops. Consequently, out of fear that the men claiming to be rebels might in fact be Gulab Singh's men might be impersonating Mian Dido, the villagers refrained from supplying food, breaking the cycle of support.

While this endeavour would have definitely impacted the logistical capabilities of Mian Dido and his band it does not seem to have dampened their spirit of defiance as indicated in the baar of Mian Dido

> “Diddo Jamval was not easy to capture. >
> The enemy cut off his supplies. >
> On being asked what he would live upon, he replied to their face, >
> ‘The Garna fruit of the Kandi has ripened >
> and berries remain in season throughout the year. >
> **I will feed myself upon them and wield my sword.**”

**Going after the rebel leader’s family**

Dido’s family too was actively sought by the government forces. A contingent was dispatched to Jagati, where Mian Dido’s elderly father Mian Hazari was present. A Sikh commander in the army Sardar Atar Singh urged him to surrender and lay down his arms in order for his life to be spared. The ageing Rajput in his nineties however stood his ground displaying valour characteristic of his race as he defiantly retorted to calls for surrender

> “Don’t you know that to lay down life bravely under a sword is thousand times preferable to fall crying in enemy hands?”

When calls for surrender went unheard Atar Singh engaged in a duel with Mian Hazari where the latter was slain as a result of his infirmity. It is alleged by local ballads that after killing Dido’s father Atar Singh dismembered his body into four and transpired the pieces to each wall of his house.

Meanwhile, Mian Dido, residing with his family in the Chirrai locality within the Bhalwalta (Udhampur) pargana occupied by him, was tracked down by a contingent under his former associate Mian Dharam Singh. While Dido attempted to resist his adversaries he was greatly hindered by the presence of his family. Therefore after making a show of resistance he eventually withdrew to the Trikota mountain with his family.

While thus giving chase to the fugitive Mian Dido Gulab Singh encamped at a two krohs distant from Chariai at the Painthal locality, an unsuccessful attempt was made on his life by a sword wielding assassin.

**Killing of Mian Dido**

Subsequently, Gulab Singh dividing his troops into three units, encircled the Trikota hills eliminating any avenues of escape for the rebel. The disposition of forces was as follows, Mian Dido’s former associate Mian Dharam Singh Raipuriah along with other Mians manned the right side while Jagat Singh Atariwala and Sardar Atar Singh Kalal along with the zamindars of Drorh and Bajial held the centre with Gulab Singh personally leading the left flank.

Having completed the encirclement the Government troops passed the night cautiously holding their positions on the watch for rebel movement. The next morning they prepared for assaulting the hills with Gulab Singh directing the forces under Wazir Zorawar Kahluria and Mian Bishna to ascend the peak of Tarkota mountain through Kotli. They had clear instructions/express orders to spare Mian Dido and bring him before Gulab Singh if he sought quarter but if engaged by the rebels they were to eliminate them without hesitation.

Gulab Singh personally led a section of his troops in the direction of Sanji Chhat and took position at a place half kroh the side of Sanji Chhat.

On observing the movements of the Government forces Mian Dido realised that the situation appeared grim and thus he resolved to hand over his dependents to the Brahamchari who was at the Shrine of Goddess.

The Saint narrated a dream he had last night to Mian Dido attempting to induce the brave warrior to seek pardon and lay down his arms

> “(it was) metaphorically revealed to me that the tree of your life was > uprooted, and the blossom of the everfresh rose of ‘Sri Devi-ji’ > bloomed afresh in the garden of Gulab Singh. For this reason I will humbly advise you that if you deem life worthwhile seek protection and turn to the divine blessings in the presence of that rose of eternal spring.”

Mian Dido however defiant as ever rejected the counsel of the Faquir emphasising that in no case he would seek anybody’s protection. Thus preparing for battle he headed fully equipped towards Chhat, where he found his passage blocked by Gulab Singh’s troops. Taking note of this Mian Dido attempted to break through the encirclement and leaving the path he attacked the enemy’s centre where the contingent of Jagat Singh Atariwala had stationed itself. Here he came face to face with the killer of his father Sardar Atar Singh Kalal whom he engaged in a duel. Sardar Atar Singh himself a seasoned fighter managed to strike Mian Dido on the head with his sword cutting a piece of noose tied around his head slightly scratching Dido’s skull.

Eager to avenge his father, the enraged Mian Dido drawing his sword fiercely declared,

> "O coward: I will instantly cut you into two"

Without a moment’s delay, he struck his adversary and in a single powerful blow, the sword cleaved his body from the shoulder to the belly and continued down to tear the thigh before touching the ground. Fearing for their lives after witnessing such a horrific scene the government forces failed to engage the bold rebel in hand to hand combat as he contemptuously sat on the top of a stone and asked for his ‘huqa’.

Bravely smoking his huqa in the face of an overwhelming force of the enemy he dared Gulab Singh to engage him in a duel shouting

> “Where is he ? So that in a duel in this battlefield we may prove our manliness.”

Unable to confront him directly and realising it was impossible to capture him alive, some of the Khalsa soldiers discharged their matchlocks as a result of which a bullet struck his throat eventually killing him. It was thus Mian Dido met his death near the Vaishno Devi temple, the paths to which he got repaired according to local legend during his annual visit during the Navratras.

Gulab Singh was filled sorrow at the death of the rebel leader for Dido was not only a valiant commander but also his relative. The episode is depicted thus in the Gulabnama

> “His Lordship felt distressed on the news of the death of such a brave one; for he had set his heart on capturing him alive and to present him before the Sarkar, and also because he was his relative, so his death caused him much anguish.

**Winning Hearts and Minds**

But Gulab Singh’s campaign did not end with merely killing the rebel leaders and taking their strongholds. Unlike many of his contemporaries he understood that the killing of one rebel would simply give rise to others as their family and friends sought vengeance. Keeping that in mind he took both of Mian Dido’s sons Basant Singh and Mian Gusahon under his wing as his attendants with Mian Basant Singh eventually rising to the rank of Commandant of the cavalry.

This decision earned Gulab Singh the loyalty of the sons of the very person his men had killed in battle. The Gulabnama narrates an incident where Gulab Singh after a forced march had halted at Yakamusi and headed for a desolate area with a view to hunt. In the hunt there arose a moment when the troopers accompanying him lagged behind as he chased the game alone. Only Mian Basant Singh, the eldest son of Mian Dido managed to keep up with Gulab Singh’s horse. What followed was as follows:

> When they had travelled far from the guards he (Gulab Singh) removed > his own weapons and handed them over to the said Mian and declared, “O > Basant Singh ! Your illustrious father has been killed by me; and **a > Rajput is one who avenges his father’s blood**. Now I am without weapon and removed far from my troops. What more favourable opportunity you will get to avenge on me for the blood of your father ?’’ >
> On hearing these words the said Mian stood bewildered and submitted > humbly, “I am reared of the blessings of your benefactions. How such an act can be done by me.” He thus let the weapons drop and himself fell on his feet. Such manliness and trial of fortune is not possible of the people at large
