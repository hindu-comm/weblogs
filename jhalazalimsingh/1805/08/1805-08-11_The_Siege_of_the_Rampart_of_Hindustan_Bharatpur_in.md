**Introduction and Background**

The Siege of Bharatpur (1805) in the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803 to 1805) stands as a significant yet relatively unknown event in Indian history, showcasing an instance when a European military contingent was compelled to make a withdrawal after repeated failures in the face of an indigenous power.

*Yashwant Rao Holkar with Ranjit Singh, the Maharaja of Punjab (not to be confused with the Raja of Bharatpur also named Ranjit Singh) in 1805*

The Kingdom of Bharatpur had supported the British against the armies under Daulat Rao Sindhia in the first phase of the war delivering the final coup de grace to the Maratha paltans at Laswari. Their contribution incidentally is totally ignored in virtually every British record but receives mention by native writers including the Maratha dispatches themselves

> “Thereafter the Macheriwala Rao Raja and Bharatpur and other zamindars
> (i.e., their contingents) attacked the rear of the paltan. As the camp
> was plundered, thousands of our paltan were slain.”

However, later on it switched sides and joined the Maratha chief Jaswant Rao Holkar due to a variety of reasons which are beyond the scope of this article. However despite various negotiations which took place an often repeated theme in contemporary dispatches exchanged between the two seems to be over the protection of cows!!

> Koer Rundhere Sing is enterprising and high minded, and **detesting
> the continuance of the English in this quarter, and their killing
> cows, and scorns to yield obedience to them ; he has therefore. taken
> an oath to join you heart and hand**, has bound his loins in his
> determination to extirpate them, and now expects your answer.
>
> \- Letter from Naranjan Lal to Jaswant Rao Holkar expressing the views
> of Prince Randhir Singh (son of Raja Ranjit Singh)

> “Just now Rajah Runjeet Sing is ready to join you ; and has told me
> that he was from necessity compelled to join the reprobate (English);
> for the enemy surrounded his country, and the Rajah of Jaypoor had
> also joined them, and your victorious army was at a great distance.
>
> But now, **conformable to his oath, and by the worship of the cow, he
> has girt his loins with firmness. If just now your victorious army
> will approach, he is ready to sacrifice his life** . But do not act as
> formerly, for the enemy tremble like reeds at your power and
> greatness. Your victorious army without fighting retreated, evading an

> us? If you have suspicions of us, bury them ; **for in this country,
> which is a most sanctified place of worship, and the residence of our
> god, how can we support the slaughter of Cows?**”
>
> \- Letter from Naranjan Lal to Jaswant Rao Holkar expressing the views
> of Raja Ranjit Singh

Taking an oath on the water of the Ganga, Raja Ranjit Singh (not to be confused with the Sikh ruler of Punjab) vowed to support Holkar in expelling the British after granting him asylum in the fort of Deeg. The battle of Deeg and its subsequent siege, however, led to the joint Maratha-Jat forces abandoning the fort after inflicting 643 casualties including the death of General Fraser on the former occasion.

These forces subsequently headed towards the Jat capital of Bharatpur where Raja Ranjit Singh aided by Holkar prepared his defences after the failure of negotiations. In this he had the full support of his commanders who vowed not to yield the fort so long as they lived. His Ranis too heroically refused to seek asylum in Jodhpur or Jaipur for while he defended the fort recalling the defiant spirit with which they faced the invasion of Najaf Khan.

> “Then the Raja went to his harem and asked the Ranis if they agreed to
> his sending them in litters with Kumar Durjan Sal to Jodhpur and
> Jaipur for asylum, while he would defend the fort. They wept and
> refused, pointing out how Pratap Singh of Jaipur had surrendered the
> refugee Nawab Wazir Ali**\*** to these very English. “Our family has
> never done this and shall never seek refuge with others. In the same
> way that Khattu Rani and all the other Ranis, in the time of Najaf
> Khan destroyed themselves, we shall slay ourselves by lying on
> gunpowder and setting fire to it. We dislike begging shelter at the
> doors of others.”
>
> \- “History of the Bharatpur Raj family” by Fransoo
>
> **\* It should be noted that the Raja gave him up on the conditions
> that his life should be spared, and that he should not be bound by
> fetters. A tall ask considering he had massacred several Europeans
> including the British Resident at Benaras in cold blood.**

**The Fort of Bharatpur**

Malleson in his “Decisive Battles of India” provides a detailed description of the Fort of Bharatpur. Located in the middle of an almost level plain covered with a thick jungle and several bodies of water or ponds the town, eight miles in circumference was bounded on the western side by a ridge of low, bare, flat rocks ; whilst on the three other sides its limits are dotted by a few isolated eminences of no great height or size.

*Map of the Fort as given in the “Narrative of the siege and capture of Bhurtpore, in the province of Agra, upper Hindoostan” by J.N.Creighton*

The fortifications consisted of a citadel and a surrounding wall made up of thirty-four tall mud bastions. These bastions were connected by sections of wall and generally had shapes resembling either semi-circles or frustra of cones.

Certain bastions within the fortification featured raised platforms known as "cavaliers." These platforms were strategically positioned on the bastions to allow firing over the main parapet without obstructing the fire from the primary defence line. The inclusion of cavaliers enabled the defenders to achieve a higher intensity of fire directed towards any attacking forces. In the context of Bharatpur, many of these bastions had cavaliers that were connected to the curtain walls by elongated passages. This architectural arrangement facilitated the movement of defenders between different defensive structures, enhancing their ability to respond effectively to threats from various directions.

The ramparts were often fortified with multiple rows of upright tree trunks embedded in the earthen walls. These were built using a mixture of clay, straw, and cow dung, which was layered and sun-dried, making it particularly effective against the artillery of that era. The perimeter was enclosed by a dry watercourse called a "nala," with steep, nearly vertical edges.

Its citadel held complete control over the town and stood at a height of 114 feet above the ground and was heavily fortified. The moat, 150 feet wide and 59 feet deep, had a stone revetment facing the outer slope. This outer slope, called the counterscarp, had a vertical stone facing. Emerging from the base of the counterscarp, there was an 80-foot-tall stone wall called a "fausse-braye" in mediaeval fortifications. In India, this was termed as the Rounee and was designed to protect the ditch surrounding the fort. This wall was well protected by forty semicircular towers. Above the fausse-braye, there was another stone wall that reached 74 feet in height. This wall had eleven conical bastions, reaching a total height of 173 feet.

Bharatpur’s defences were further enhanced by its proximity to a lake named "Moti Jhil." This lake was bordered by an embankment on the town's side and if breached, it would not only fill the ditch but also flood a significant portion of the surrounding area making the defences difficult to assault. This gave rise to a prophetic legend that

> Bharatpur would only fall when a long-nosed alligator or *a kumbhir*

The town was accessible through nine gates, each surrounded by a number of semi-circular earthworks for their defence. Garrisoned by Jats, known for the fierce defence of their citadels and bolstered by the traditional belief that Lord Krishna was the *killedar* (Governor or Custodian) the fort, Bharatpur was regarded as impregnable. The westernised battalions of Holkar with their artillery further bolstered the firepower of the defenders.

**The British Attitude**

To the English forces, Bharatpur was an object of contempt for within a span of six months they had succeeded in storming and occupying some of the strongest forts in India. The fort of Aligarh which had been modernised along European lines by French engineers fell due to the aid of Captain Lucan, a European deserter formerly in Maratha service who guided the British storming party.

The formidable Agra fort renowned for its vast caches of artillery, the fortified city and stronghold of Ahmednagar and the towering fortress of Gwalior all fell under British control. Their mercenary garrisons, despite being well-equipped, capitulated with minimal opposition due to the dearth of effective leadership. This susceptibility was compounded by the Sindhian army's heavy dependence on European mercenary officers, a substantial majority of whom defected to the British side during the 2nd Anglo Maratha War. The British adeptly exploited this situation, successfully enticing officers, Maratha generals like Ambaji Ingle and sometimes entire battalions to switch allegiance.

**Advance on the City**

On 3rd January, Lord Lake's British force arrived at Bharatpur, establishing its position. The force comprised 800 Dragoons, 1,600 Native Cavalry, 1,000 European Infantry, and 4,400 Native Infantry, supported by 3 officers and 3 Pioneer companies. Artillery included a troop of Horse Artillery with 1 Captain and 2 Subalterns, along with Foot Artillery under a Lieutenant Colonel, 4 Captains, 7 Subalterns, 184 NCOs, 137 Irregular Native Golundauze and 492 Native Gun Lascars. Additionally, 174 Gun Lascars, formerly in Maratha service augmented the force.

The force brought with them a total of a 65 pieces of Field Ordinance and Siege Equipment consisting of six English 18 Pounders, four 8 inch and four 5.5 inch howitzers.

The following day, they occupied a grove ahead of their Camp to aid trench opening. By January 5th, a Breaching Battery was set up with six 18-pounders with another battery, with four 8-inch and four 5-inch mortars being completed by noon on the 7th. Cannonfire was mutually exchanged by both sides.

George Call’s journal mentions that according to hurkarrah (spy) sent into the town the besieging mortar fire led to the killing and wounding of several people. This is also verified by the account of John Shipp

> “Our shells, if thrown further into the town, must have been most
> destructive, for the population was evidently prodigious, from the
> number of fighting men. The houses frequently appeared on fire, and
> several small explosions took place daily ; no doubt, small magazines.
> These little incidents generally created cheering by the besiegers,
> and redoubled firing by the enemy.”

In response a “council of War” in the defending camp planed a night attack on the battery. However this attack never came and the next morning the British camp was informed by a hurkarrah that this was due to a disagreement among the Holkar and Amir Khan (Note: Amir Khan was not yet present at Bharatpur) on the mode of Attack. George Call, however, goes on to state that it is more likely they did not launch an attack, as they may have received information indicating that the Battery was aware of their plans.

Shipp’s account also makes mention of an attempt on the life of Raja Ranjit Singh himself by the Besieging artillery

> “In the course of the day we saw the rajah for the first time: he was
> on the shabroodge, or royal bastion, with his suite, reconnoitring
> with a spyglass. The officer commanding the howitzer battery laid a
> shell for the shabroodge, which struck the very top of it, and soon
> dislodged his highness and suite.
>
> In a moment not a soul was to be seen.”

*Gun emplacement, part of the defences of Bhurtpore after it’s fall in 1826*

In vengeance for having targeted the King himself the defenders opened up with the famous 72 pounder gun of Bharatpur stationed on the Burj. However the defenders failed to inflict actual damage due to their inability to depress the gun enough

> “On this bastion was an enormous gun, about a seventy-two-pounder,
> which before had been laid up in embryo, but which, as a mark of
> revenge for our having disturbed his highness, was now got ready. From
> its gigantic size they could not depress it sufficiently to bear upon

> went; the report was like that of an earthquake, but the ball went a
> good quarter of a mile over us. Several other shots were, in the
> course of the day, fired from it, but the balls never came nearer.”

Failing to hit the assaulting battery with their prize weapon (christened “Civil Tom by the besiegers) the Defenders turned the Gun towards the English camp, and sent a ball near the flag opposite Lord Lake's tent located at a distance of more than two miles from the fort.

The defenders however expressed little fear of the British troops setting up a position between of two of their batteries. This is lamented by a later commentator on the Siege

> “The enemy are now found acting with extraordinary boldness : they
> posted a line of sentries between the British batteries and their own
> ditch, we having no advanced place of arms from whence a fire might be
> kept up to check their audacity. A trench is opened by them opposite
> the left post of attack, which enables them to enfilade the plain over
> which the storming party may have to march, while in front they occupy
> the dry tank, as an advanced post for the same purpose, and are busy
> in improving the ditch in front of the breach. No attempt is made by
> the besiegers, to counteract these operations on the part of the
> enemy.”

An assault was allegedly planned for the night of 8th January but delayed by General Lake due to their being “rumours of water in the ditch” surrounding the fort. However by the afternoon of the 9th, when a breach in the Town-wall was deemed practicable and a decision was made to launch the assault that very evening.

An idea of the disposition of the Jat garrison can be gained from Fransoo’s work.

Shyam Mal fought on the side of the Nim Darwaza side while Thakur Karam Singh was in charge of the Atalband Darwaza and Thakur Kesri Singh at the Bhim Narayan Darwaza. Kumar Randhir Singh manned the Shamsher Darwaza while Kumar Pirthi Singh and Baldeo Singh defended the Fateh Burj or Bastion during the siege.

**First Assault - 9th January**

The British storming party organised into three columns commenced the assault after departing from the trenches at eight in the evening towards the *Kumbher Darwaza*. Lt-Colonel Ryan led a group comprising 150 European soldiers and a Sepoy battalion to assault the *Nim Darwaza*, while Major Hawkes commanded two companies of the 75th Regiment and another Sepoy battalion advancing towards the *Anar Darwaza*. Their orders were to enter the town or in case of failure, to reinforce the centre Column in assaulting the breach. The centre column, led by Lt-Colonel Maitland consisting of 500 men and a Sepoy battalion had orders to take the enemy by surprise. The centre column was reinforced by four 6 pounder guns while the other two columns were assigned two 6 pounders each,

The British attack was to be guided by an Indian Golundaz (artilleryman) who had “defected” from the fort. He was entrusted by the Adjutant-general of the army Salkeld to John Shipp who tied a rope around the wrist of the guide in case the defector attempted an escape. However Lt Colonel Maitland who was leading the column for reasons best known to him had the defector sent away before the column had reached its destination

> “The former officer came in front to me, and pointed out the road to
> glory ; but, observing the native whom I had in charge, he asked who
> he was; and, on being informed, said, “We can find the way without him
> ; let him go about his business." I remonstrated, and repeated to him
> the instructions I had received; but his answer was, "I don't care ;
> if you don't obey my orders, I will send you to the rear." I did obey,
> and on we moved to the attack.”

This dismissal combined with the disarrangement of the columns due to the irregularity of the terrain not only delayed the advance of the troops, but also led to a considerable number of men losing their way with some following the left column and some the right. Therefore the columns which were to begin the assault at dusk did not reach their destination till half past eight.

> in consequence of which many lost their way-some following those for
> the left attack, others calling out, "Where is the breach ?"-and the
> column fell into confusion. At last Major Salkeld, Quarter Master
> General, came up, and pointed out the true direction.

The attempt at surprise failed completely as the column was detected 50 paces from the ditch and was met with an instant barrage of rocket fire, musketry and cannonade from the troops of Akhi Singh Purohit and *Sebastian Sahib (appears to be a European mercenary)*. As Blue lights and dead underwood (set on fire) were suspended from the forts for exposing the enemy, the garrison unleashed a relentless fusillade of muskets and grape-shot from three cannons, positioned at a circular Bastion adjacent to the breach. Under the volume of fire, a party of Beldars under a Serjeant of Artillery carrying three hundred fascines (to be used in filling up the ditch) fled with few being found when desperately needed.

To an attacker the Fort seemed to present quite a sight:

> “The enemy did not discover our approach till within fifty paces of
> the ditch, when a tremendous cannonade and peals of musketry
> commenced; rockets were flying in all directions ; blue lights were
> hoisted ; and the fort seemed convulsed to its very foundation. Its
> ramparts seemed like some great volcano vomiting tremendous volumes of
> fiery matter; the roaring of the great guns shook the earth beneath
> our feet ; their small arms seemed like the rolling of ten thousand
> drums; and their war trumpets rent the air asunder. Men were seen
> skipping along the lighted ramparts, as busy as emmets collecting
> stores for the dreary days of winter. The scene was awfully grand, and
> must have been sublimely beautiful to the distant spectator.”

The storming party moved along the town exposed to fire on it’s flanks before reaching the breach in a state of confusion where to their horror they suddenly encountered a ditch ingeniously filled with water

> “The enemy (defenders) had here a tongue of land or dam, 12 or 15 feet
> broad, tapering off to 3 feet at its narrowest end towards the fort.
> This bank of earth had served the purposes of a bridge; but in order
> to fill all parts of the ditch near to the breach with water, a space
> of 15 feet in length had been cut through or broken down at the
> narrowest part of this dam, the broken part being about 4 feet below
> the level of the water, and forming the only passage across the ditch.
> The water in the ditch on each side of this broken dam was far beyond
> the depth of a man, and after crossing this, the breach could not be
> approached, except by a small berm at the foot of the rampart about 2
> feet broad.”

In their state of panic the foremost of the storming party fell into the trench, and wetted their Ammunition while others got over it, scaling ladders were at last laid across the cut, but by this time there was a state of confusion all around.

*Colonel Maitland at Bhurtpore*, *Cassell's illustrated history of India by Grant, James*

About 150 troops successfully made it across the cut, but on reaching the breach the first artillery discharge killed Colonel Maitland and wounded Major Campbell. The defenders had placed three guns in the flank or neck of the circular bastion next to the breach which opened devastating fire of grapeshot supported by musketry on the storming party. The Breach itself had been filled by driving in large pieces of wood, stakes, stones and pointed bamboos, defended resolutely by Jat spearmen hurling small spears, stones, pots filled with gunpowder, and bundles of lighted straw on the enemy.

The fort assault is vividly described by John Shipp based on his experience:

> “….the enemy had completely repaired that, by driving in large pieces
> of wood, stakes, stones, bushes, and pointed bamboos, through the
> crevices of which was a mass of spears jobbing diagonally, which
> seemed to move by mechanism. Such was the footing we had, that it was
> utterly impossible to approach these formidable weapons ; meantime,
> small spears or darts were hurled at us ; and stones, lumps of wood,
> stink-pots, and bundles of lighted straw, thrown upon us. In the midst
> of this tumult, I got one of my legs through a hole, so that I could
> see into the interior of the fort. The people were like a swarm of
> bees. In a moment I felt something seize my foot ; I pulled with all
> my might, and at last succeeded in disengaging my leg, but leaving my
> boot behind me.”

Another account describes how a party of about about twenty-three men from the 22nd flankers, managed to crossed the ditch and mount the breach but lacking support were asked to sit down under cover by Lieutenant Manser, while he himself went in search of the rest of the column. Eventually they were forced to withdraw after their remaining officers, Lieutenants Sweetnam and Creswell were wounded and no supported arrived.

Cornet George Mccall of the 27th Light Dragoons mentions in his journal that no less than 4 attempts were made by the storming party to ascend the breach without success

> “….H.M. 75th Regt. attempted the breach 4 different Times, and the
> last time their Gallant Commander, Lieut.-Colonel Maitland with the
> Brigade Major of the Day of Infantry, Captain Wallace, both of whom
> had no sooner reached the summit than they were knocked back into the
> Ditch by the spears and killed.”

At the same time, the rear of the column suffered intensely from the defender’s gunfire forcing the British troops to retreat through the ditch which ended up becoming a watery grave for many an Englishman. The right column achieved some success by spiking three of the defender’s guns outside the town before they regrouped to support the centre. The left column, on the other hand, lost its way and was forced to retreat after finding the gateway blocked by a ditch.

The retreat proved to be the most perilous phase of the operation, with troops exposed to the enemy's withering fire, resulting in substantial casualties. The repulse led to the death of 5 officers and 85 soldiers and wounding of another 23 officers and 371 soldiers with John Shipp recalling how

> “fellows were mowed down like corn-fields, without the slightest hope
> of success.”

Incidentally a Maratha dispatch reporting this battle mentions the following

> “***They (someone in paltans of Holkar) established contact with the
> English saying we will join you, when you advance on us. We will fire
> blanks. Come and take our artillery too***. So 4 english battalions
> advanced on Holkar’s paltan. They fired a few blanks then the english
> were convinced. Then they advanced boldly. 3 english paltans came
> within gunshot range. ***Our men had kept cannons prepared with grape
> and chain shot. All of it was fired at once. The English took very
> heavy casualties. They had been very sure of victory.*** 2 prahars the
> firing continued from both sides. The English lost 3 paltans. One
> paltan was left which fled. the cavalry did not engage”

If the dispatch is to be believed the Golundaz “defector” from the fort was possibly a spy sent by Holkar to lure the attackers into a well prepared trap. The breach itself had been twice built up and stockaded by the defenders while the defences on each side remained unharmed from British artillery fire. Furthermore, the neck and rounded structures of the collateral bastions dominated the breach in such a way that any troops trying to climb it would be vulnerable to deadly fire from both the rear and the flanks. All these factors do point towards the possibility of this being a ruse on part of the defenders.

The defenders openly defied the British and repaired breaches under the very gaze of the besiegers' batteries. Attempts at reconnaissance faced setbacks and forage in the British camp became scarce. Considering the first breach attempted to be "strong and impracticable," the engineer shifted his position further east, to a position less daunting.

Several new batteries (composed of two 24-pdr, ten 18-pdr, seven 12-pdr guns and 8 mortars) were erected but despite battering down a significant section of the rampart, the practicality of creating a breach proved elusive, as the earth continually fell into the deepened enemy ditch and the breach, repeatedly stockaded by the defenders. The Britishers responded by firing grape or case shot from the breaching batteries at night to prevent the breach from being stockaded but given their distance from the breach this measure only served to waste ammunition. The siege stagnated with the British failing to advance a foot beyond their trenches, the nearest of which was 700 yards from the fort.

They were, however, reinforced by 700 horsemen (presumably under the chief Ismael Beg) who deserted from Holkar's army on the 14th. George Call in his journal makes a mention of “a party came over from the Enemy” (which included 15 sepoys from the EIC who had defected or were taken prisoner by Holkar in Monson’s Retreat) on the afternoon of the 17th.

The same day an uncle of Prince Randhir Singh was killed while in the process of inspecting the corpses of the Englishmen killed in the previous assault in broad daylight by a shot from the old Battery. Capt Nelly commanding the Old Battery had observed a large group of defenders peering into the Ditch follows. This party was soon joined by “a Person better dressed than the others, with a large Umbrella over him” who descend a little way down into the Breach. The Captain who was observing him through his field glass directed one of his guns at what appeared to be a person of rank with the remark

> “we will show this fine curious gentleman how well we can hit a mark’’

The shot struck the individual killing him instantly with a hurkarrah subsequently confirming the death of the uncle. Incidentally about a month later Capt J Nelly while in command of a battery was badly wounded in the eye and deprived of his sight, forcing him to leave the service.

On January 18th orders were issued to the effect that no more than one dram (type of Liquor) was to be issued to each European in the trenches and two to men in the working parties perhaps to prevent any slackness. The besieging force continued to be reinforced and were joined by 3 battalions and 6 field-pieces under Maj-Gen Smith on the 20th.

To reach the prospective breach, the attackers would first have to cross a wet ditch that was unfordable, necessitating the use of three broad ladders or floating bridges. However, these ladders had to be precisely cut to match the exact width of the ditch of which the attackers were unaware. Several inventive attempts were made to gather intelligence on the critical measurements of the ditch.

One such effort involved a native non-commissioned officer, who, enticed by promises of promotion and a monetary reward, was tasked with executing a plan to determine the ditch's dimensions. Equipped with a bow and heavy arrow, to which a small silken cord was attached, he was instructed to shoot the arrow from the glacis to the opposite scarp of the ditch, using the cord to measure its width. In case of failure, he was provided with an irregularly shaped piece of iron, also fastened to a cord, which he was to throw across the ditch. He would then pull the cord back until the object began to roll, marking the point where it started and measuring both the width and depth of the ditch. However despite numerous attempts and determined efforts, the defender’s nightly placement of a chain sentries between the attacker’s works and the ditch thwarted all efforts.

Several additional attempts were made to properly reconnoitre the fort but as the Journal of an officer repeatedly points out were prevented by the thick forests surrounding the fort. An entry on the 14th states

> “Early this morning, an attempt was made to reconnoitre the Aine gate,
> from a small brick enclosure about 280 yards in advance of the
> Sand-hill post, but nothing could be seen, it being hid from view by
> trees. The enemy being in force in front, and the town firing upon us,
> we were discovered and retired.”

A suggestion of using a small detachment to force its way through the defending sentries in a night attack and then examine the ditch was also made but then abandoned in favour of another stratagem.

The ruse involved the clever used of a native volunteers namely a havildar and two troopers of the 3rd Regiment of Native Cavalry. This group of men under instructions left the British camp in Indian clothing at about 3 PM with a party of British infantry appearing to give chase opened fire on them with blanks. Thus pretending to be deserters they approached the ditch of the fort where the horses of two of the troopers fell. The havildar then called out to the defenders on the walls to be shown the way into the city so that they could escape from the “banchut feringhees”. This demand was promptly complied with and the havildar along with his men rode along the ditch until he had passed the breach, and made his observations. His task completed he spun his horse around and galloped back with full speed towards the British lines. The Jats realising they had been duped opened fire upon the supposed deserters, but to no avail. For this act the Havaldar and his were given a reward of five hundred rupees each, and awarded immediate promotion.

**Second Assault - 21st January**

On the basis of the report supplied by the troopers, the three floating bridges were reduced to 28 feet in length. While no doubt bold the Havaldar’s reconnaissance could in no way have been complete given the speed at which events occurred. It was thus that the entirety of the assault depended on the vague assurance of a Havaldar and 2 privates of the native cavalry who claimed that the ditch at the point was neither broad nor deep and easy to ascend.

Between the night of 20th and the 21st the attackers were forced to raise a small battery of two 6-pounder field pieces to keep the guns brought out in the defenders outworks in check. At around 4 AM a little before daylight the storming party had taken their positions in the trenches only to be greeted by the sight of a stockaded breach at daybreak. Thus for the fifth time the batteries were employed in creating a practicable breach by demolishing the stockade which wasn’t achieved till a little before three P.M.

Finally did the ill-fated assault commence at three o'clock with a Howitzer shell intended for signalling the attack detonating in the gun's muzzle, killing two British Grenadiers. The storming party composed of 150 men from the 76th, 120 from the 75th, 100 from the 1st European Regiment, and 50 from the 22nd Flankers led the assault and were to be supported by the rest of those regiments and second battalions of the 9th, 15th, and 22nd N.I. once they succeeded in their objective. They were equipped with the portable bridges carried by picked men, trained in their deployment while the 75th and 76th regiments provided cover fire to deter enemies during the operation. Shipp gives a description of the device in his memoirs

> “This bridge could be thrown a considerable distance by a hundred men,
> and was supported by ghee dubbahs (skins) in which the natives keep
> oil and butter for exportation; which, when dried, are light, and will
> bear a considerable weight before you can sink them. Elephants and
> camels were also laden with tents, and hackeries, or carts drawn by
> bullocks, with bales of cotton, all to fill up the ditch, to enable us
> to cross to the breach.”

However, to the shock of the enemy upon reaching the ditch, they discovered it was broader than expected, as the Jats had erected a dam below the breach increasing the depth of the water to at least 8 feet and width of the moat to about 40 feet by letting in more water through canals. The portable bridges (28 feet in length) when launched, fell short by about a third, with an attempt to extend it using scaling ladders ending in failure with one of the bridges being overturned. On the right side of the breach, an under-work manned by matchlock-men and several guns poured fire on the attackers while those attempting to swim across were raked by the fire of two cannons trained on the spot. Meanwhile the British camels and elephants afraid of the incessant firing could not be coerced to approach the fort with many throwing of their bales of cotton and scampering off to the British or into the wild. Two mines were also sprung by the defenders near the edge of the ditch and next to the clump of trees close to the defenders outposts but were at a distance which was not effective enough to cause casualties.

Subsequently some parties were instructed to swim across a ditch. Lieutenant Morris of the Bengal European Regiment (General Lake frequently referred to them as his own "Dirty Shirts" because they had not found time to change, seeing constant service in the siege. He approvingly remarked that their soiled shirts were a badge of honor, signifying their readiness to forsake personal comfort in service of their duty), along with Lieutenant Brown and 12 Grenadiers, volunteered to lead the swimming party. The swimmers plunged into the water, reached the opposite bank and managed to climb up to the breach. But before they could secure their position the Jat defenders rushed forward and hurled them down the ascent. During the engagement Lt. Morris, was shot in the neck and suffered a broken leg while ascending the breach. The officer described by Call as an “expert swimmer” rolled himself down the Breach into the ditch and managed to swim back in his wounded state before being rescued by a Private known as "Tinker Allan”. The soldier over six feet tall and famed for his bravery always positioned himself at the right of the Grenadier Company and successfully managed to evacuate his commander off the battlefield amidst the carnage.

Unable to support his vulnerable troops, Colonel Macrae ordered a confused retreat with the attackers abandoning their scaling-ladders and bridges to the enemy along with most of their wounded. When the mutilated remains of the British column finally managed to reach the safety of their trenches the defenders descended into the breach and carried off the bridge and scaling ladders as war trophies. They then proceeded to put to the sword any man they came across in the space between the battery and the breach and stripped the bodies of the dead in full view of the British troops in the battery and trenches who were powerless to act.

The right column under Col Simpson marched up to the Anar Gate, but finding an entrance impracticable retreated after joining the left column.The situation was however prevented from worsening due to the exertions of a few Sepoys manning the British artillery who managed to keep the defenders sallying out at bay

> outside posts on the right and left of the wood, threatening to attack
> it. The number of the enemy's guns bearing on the front and flank of
> the storming party during this attack, was calculated to be about 35.

Shipp’s memoirs provide a more vivid look at the British perspective on the assault

> “My men kept falling off one by one…..I received a matchlock ball,
> which entered over the right eye, and passed out over the left. This
> tumbled me, my forehead literally hanging over my nose, and the wound

Caught at the moat's edge and exposed to concentrated fire in a killing zone the attack cost the British forces 18 officers and an estimated 569 to 700 men in casualties. After the assault, the breach was promptly repaired by the defenders.

The extent of the British loss is apparent from Pester’s description

*One of the Brass Guns of Bharatpur 15 feet and 3 inches in length captured in the second siege of Bharatpur in 1826 given in the “Narrative of the siege and capture of Bhurtpore, in the province of Agra, upper Hindoostan” by J.N.Creighton*

To raise British morale after the siege Lake issued the following orders hoping to stem despair through gold:

> “ Extra batta (foreign service allowance) is to be served out to the
> Europeans today, and two hundred rupees are to be given to each native
> corps of cavalry, infantry, gun lascars, and pioneers.”

Maratha cavalry endeavoured to cut off British supplies and skirmished with the enemy. On the 23rd, Amirkhan and Bapuji Sindhia’s forces attacked a British supply convoy of 12,000 bullocks and seized their artillery. Reinforcements led by Lt-Colonel Need retrieved lost guns and dispersed Maratha forces but could secure only 1800 of the bullocks. Nevertheless, these raids failed in their objective and were frequently repulsed with supply convoys successfully resupplying the British camp.

Plans were then drawn up with the intention of attacking the Aine gate with the Quarter Master General's head hurkarrah (spy) pointing out the position of the gate. The thick trees growing within the walls however prevented a clear view of the gate itself, it was completely hid by trees growing within the walls. On the receipt of intelligence that there was a wet ditch before the Aine gate as well as the screen covering the gateway, plans to erect a new battery were suspended.

On the night of the 23rd, a gun lascar with relatives in the town volunteered to gather information on the shape and condition of the ditch near the Aine gate. He subsequently returned the next day reporting

> “the screen or ravelin work which covered the gate had no ditch before
> it, but that before the gate itself there was a broad wet ditch, being
> the identical ditch of the town brought round; and in front of the
> gate having a temporary bridge of logs and planks over it, concealed
> from view by the mud screen.

Finding it an unfeasible site to attack due to the following reasons the British abandoned the plan

> “As the same impediment of a broad wet ditch lay here as at the former
> points breached, with the addition of a mud wall screen to be battered
> before the gate could be seen; and as the gate when battered would
> still be inaccessible if the temporary bridge was pulled away; lastly,
> as any breach of the gate would be well defended by the curtain
> between it and tower No. 3, which would take a storming party in
> flank, and also by the neck and body of the tower itself, which would
> take them in reverse, it was thought advisable to give up the project
> of attacking the Aine gate .”

On the 24th Lieutenant Colonel Don led a convoy of the sick and wounded escorted by the 29th Dragoons, 2nd Regiment of Native Cavalry and three Battalions of Native Infantry to Agra in order to replenish supplies of grain and ammunition. The grain scarcity in the camp permitted the rationing of only a pound of attah (flour) and two chittacks of daul (split peas or vetches) per man until the return of the supply convoy

Subsequently on the 6th of February the British forces shifted their ground in the morning, leaving a piquet in the village of Aine, and another in the advanced post in its front, taking up a new position in the southeast nearer to the wood to the right of their former encampment, at a distance of about 2,500 yards from the town.

Morale had indeed taken a hit as described by Shipp

> “It was now truly distressing to enter our men's tents, where, but a
> month before, the merry joke went round, and mirth and hilarity
> prevailed. Naught but gloomy faces, and even them but few, were to be
> seen : some had lost brothers ; others, dear comrades ; Captain
> Lindsay had lost his leg ; Lieutenant Creswell had been cut to pieces
> ; and every other officer was wounded. Our loss in killed and wounded
> in the two assaults, in our two companies alone, was nearly the one
> half of the total number.”

On February 10th, reinforcements consisting of the 86th Regiment, 8 companies of the 65th, 4 N.I. battalions, Bombay Cavalry and 500 irregular horsemen under Maj-General Jones arrived. The sepoys from the Bombay division termed “*Unta - Goorgoors” * (name probably derive it from the peculiar shape of the caps of the sipahees shaped like a hookah with a small ball at the top) would proceed to make ** a mark on the defenders for their valour. Sleeman who visited the place years later makes note of this

> “They pointed out to us where the different corps were posted. There
> was one corps which had signalized itself a good deal, but of which I
> had never before heard, though all around me seemed extremely well
> acquainted with it—this was the "Unta Goorgoor's." At last Godby came
> to my side, and told me this was the name by which the Bombay troops
> were always known in Bengal, though no one seemed to know whence it
> came.”

Many batteries were erected to breach the walls but the Jats displayed their characteristic obstinacy and by the the 14th, the first Breach was thrice stockaded, the second five times and the third was stockaded for the second time with thick mud walls being erected. The Besiegers attempted to put an end to this by firing Grape and Case shot at irregular intervals in a hope to get Working Parties of the defenders but to no avail. On the night of the 17th Grape Shot was substituted for shells. A total of 250 shells were fired during the night of the 17th and on 18th from the mortars with additional 116 rounds from each gun in the battery. But these yielded little result with the breach being stockaded by the resolute defenders nevertheless. The frustration of the Besiegers is apparent from General Lake’s letter to the Governor General where he remarked

> “that this repeated stockading of the breach constituted the principal
> source of that resistance, which he found so formidable throughout the
> siege”

(**NOTE**: **This tactic was employed throughout the siege with almost every attempt by the Britishers to breach the fort ending up getting stockaded so it would be of no use to repeat this throughout the course of this article. It became a daily affair where the Besiegers would make a Breach with great difficulty only to find it repaired or reinforced the next day.**)

Another tactic employed by the defenders was drawing back their guns into the area of the towers as soon as they fired thus preventing the British artillery’s attempts to target them. Shipp in his memoir even makes mention of defenders digging holes in the ramparts (Bharatpur being a mud fort) in which they took shelter from incoming artillery fire!! Defender sorties inflicted casualties and mutilated many foragers of the British army and their cavalry escort to intimidate them while constantly displaying captured weaponry and even clothes to further demoralise their enemy. On the 16th a group of British grass-cutters escorted by 30 troopers was attacked with 10 troopers being killed and wounded alongside numerous grass-cutters by a sortie. On the 19th, a Sand-bag Battery (about seventy yards from a bastion) was commenced to silence the guns in the gorge of another tower. The very next morning it was assaulted by the defenders, who accompanied by coolies and women, emptied the sand-bags and carried a great part of them away into the Town after destroying the Battery.

Throughout the siege, the fort's artillery fire remained unrelenting, and the British gunners faced a peculiar challenge. According to one account, General Lake's strict adherence to uniform decorum proved highly impractical, as his scarlet coat and plumed hat attracted a deadly barrage whenever he and his staff visited the trenches. This persisted until a blunt-spoken artillery captain informed Lake that his plumes endangered the lives of every man in the battery, urging him to forgo them during his visits—an appeal that was soon adopted by the entire staff.

Throughout the battle, Ranjit Singh used go out of the fort at night in disguise for worshipping Giriraj (Govardhan) and gave alms to beggars. Simultaneously, native sepoys in British service lost morale when they claimed to see Lord Krishna (believed to be the Killedar of Bharatpur) dressed in yellow garments, and armed with a bow , mace, conch, and pipe. The populace seems to be equally defiant and indifferent to British presence as apparent from several instances in British records where they grazed cattle outside the fort retreating under the cover of defensive fire from the fort only when British troops arrived.

The disposition of the defenders according to the British forces at this time was as follows

> The Polier and Maharaje brigades are stationed from the Muttra gate to
> the Shumshere gate, with 21 guns. From the Shumshere gate to the Aine
> gate there is posted one battalion of 200 men of Bappoo Scindeah, with
> two guns. At the Ateel gate 3,000 Ally Gholes**\*** are encamped, with
> twelve guns. Rajah Runjeet Sing has posted himself at the Aine gate
> with his Dewan, Raj Sing. Buldeo Sing, the Rajah's son, is stationed
> at the Neem gate, with one gun ; and Lutchmoon Sing, another son, at
> the Muttra gate. Rhunder Sing, the eldest son, has the charge of the
> fort, and a general superintendence of the lines of defence from the
> Basseen gate to the Aine gate. He remains constantly prepared with a
> considerable force."
>
> \*Aligholes were a body of selected men meant for desperate service
> and engagements particularly those involving charges and hand to hand
> combat. Traditionally believed to be composed only of Pathans, records
> indicate the presence of ghols under Hindu officers in Bharatpur with
> bodies named as “Hanuman ghol”, “Suraj Ghol”, “Ram Ghol” etc

The book “Observations on the attack of Mud Forts” written by a Bengal Army officer who witnessed the siege makes mention of British concerns about counter mining by the defenders in order to inflict casualties on the storming party

> “from the information he (the author) received, he was certain that
> they (defenders) had sunk several countermines opposite the breach,
> with the intention of springing them under the storming party. To
> endeavour to fire those mines therefore, previously to the assault,
> was worthy almost of any sacrifice, but by no means easily
> accomplished.”

Attempts were therefore made to set off the mines mirroring those followed by other powers in India. It involved undertaking a risky and near suicidal approach for promises of a high monetary reward. The author provides a description of the same:

> Bhungees, men usually employed to perform the most menial offices, are
> also engaged by the natives to execute the most desperate services:
> among others that here mentioned. Two or three of these are generally
> employed. They strip themsclves naked, take each a pot filled with
> live coal, which he conceals under a loose cloth thrown over him; and
> having in the day, reconnoitred, they go at night, up to the ditch,
> and having thrown off the cloth, strew the fire along the
> counterscarp; so as to roll down, and fall upon the loose powder on
> the platform above described, and fire the mine. If they succeed and
> escape the explosion, and the enemy, they receive a handsome reward,
> if they do not escape, it is invariably given to their families.

On February 19th, in a desperate move, the British forces hired three Bhungees, promising them 1,000 rupees each upon success. The Bhungee desperados requested a small down payment, which was promptly given, along with the necessary equipment for the task. Two trusted men were assigned to accompany them to prevent any betrayal or desertion. However, once these men left, the Bhungees, likely seeking to boost their courage, drank the liquor they had purchased with their advance. By the time they reached the trenches, they were utterly incapacitated, and the plan failed.

That same night, a party of Europeans, including a commissioned officer and an artillery sergeant with a slow match, was sent to carry out the same mission. They had orders that if they were unable to spring the countermines with the match, they were to fire into the breach, hoping the enemy would mistake it for a real assault and trigger their own mines. However, the defenders did not take the bait and this attempt too resulted in failure.

**Third Storm - 20th February**

Between the 19th and 20th, a decision was made to storm the breach once batteries cleared the stockade. Three columns led the attack, with Lt-Colonel Don attacking the Breach, Capt. Grant targeting outposts and entrenchments outside the walls and Lt-Colonel Taylor assaulting the Bhim Narayan Gate or scaling its walls.

On February 20th, the main or left column of European forces reached the trenches at dawn, awaiting orders for the assault. Unknown to them the same night a party of Maratha Aligholes had crept into the Advanced Parallel (probably noticing the pattern of time that the British forces usually left the position). Here they destroyed the preparations while a few of them made off with the instruments and utensils.

As the column reached the trenches, the sound of drums announced a sally out and Holkar’s Alighol of about 400 men launched an attack on their trenches supported by the detachment which had captured the small advanced Parallel of the Britishers earlier that day.

Mohan Singh in his Waqai-Holkar describes Ranjit Singh goading Holkar and his men into action with the words “From their side many attacks are being delivered , but the troops on our side have not even once shown their bravery by making a charge”. It gives a detailed account of the charge

> Muhammad Shah Khan and Andal, two captains of the Ali Ghol , on
> hearing these words , got ready to make a sortie , took up the packet
> of betel - leaf ( bira ) , and asked for one battalion to be sent to
> support them from behind . Jaswant Rao encouraged them with promises
> of high promotion . ( 20 feb . ) The two captains made a sortie , and
> passing through the English batteries struck at the English troops ,
> without flinching , although grape and cannon - balls were incessantly
> fired at them.

Charging through artillery fire, the defenders wielding pikes, spears, and swords jumped into the trenches and drove back the Europeans three times until the 22nd flankers halted their advance, forcing them to retreat.

> The Trench being very deep and narrow, unprovided with banquette steps
> to enable our men to level over, or to ascend it, our Troops were not
> able to close with the Enemy, and, unable to use either their bayonets
> or muskets with effect, they fought under great disadvantage. The
> Approach to the left of the new Breaching Battery nearest Tower No. 3,
> was carried by the Enemy sword in hand, and they kept possession of
> the small Parallel at the end of it, and of the unfinished Mine
> Gallery, the greater part of the day.

While the sally by Holkar’s Alighol did succeed in mauling the British they themselves did not escape unscathed. Mohan Singh writes

> “The English battalions pursued the fugitives up to the very gate of
> the fort and did not give them any relief from slaying and
> imprisoning; nay more, they arrived up to the ramparts and there
> engaged in fighting the battlions and campoo that were defending the
> fort. When the guns on the bastions of Bharatpur opened fire on them,
> they found it useless to stay there, but returned with victory to
> their own (English) army. On our side soldiers, beyond count, were
> slain and two guns were lost.”

This is verified by the account of John Shipp

> Every one of these men was in a state of intoxication, and fought
> desperately; but we soon drove them from the batteries; then, turning
> our guns against them, dreadful was the carnage. The fort fired
> indiscriminately at the whole party. ***These fellows were, no doubt,
> a set of vagabonds they wished to get rid of; and if this was the case
> their wish was fully realized, for a very few returned to tell the
> tale. This was the kind of retaliation we sighed for; but we lost a
> considerable number of men, killed and wounded, in this affray;*** but
> these they had not the barbarous gratification of cutting up.

During the assault on the breach, three N.I. battalions of the left column moved into the trenches at 3 p.m. By 4 p.m., as the center column engaged the enemy's outposts, the left column received the signal to advance. European troops followed by native infantry and preceded by 50 men with fascines were ordered to advance, but low morale and fear of enemy mines made the Europeans hesitate in advancing further. This prevented the N.I. battalions following them from joining the assault. Only the Flankers of the H.M. 22nd advanced but being unsupported, they withdrew.

John Pester details in his memoirs how Col Don tried to inspire the Europeans to follow him but to no avail

> “The Europeans (part of His Majesty's 75th and 76th Regiments) refused
> positively to quit the trenches. Don harangued them to no purpose,
> asking: them if they wished to bring an everlasting stain upon their
> country and themselves, and telling them that such conduct was
> unprecedented and such as British soldiers were supposed incapable of;
> but all to no purpose, and ***they persisted in their own declaration
> that “they would not go to be slaughtered.”***

Eventually it was the 12th N.I. led by Col. Don, supported by two 6-pounders, that moved towards the breach but hindered by water obstacles, they redirected to the damaged Bastion, ascending using the shrubs growing on its face. While some reached the summit and managed to plant their colours, others refused to advance.

Exposed to Jat spears, musketry and firepots filled with gunpowder for an hour and a half, their morale was shattered after the defenders exploded a mine (during the assault the defenders sprung one Mine in the Breach and three in the Counterscarp but these caused little damage since the Native Infantry had assaulted the bastion itself rather than the breach). British sources allege that the mine explosion had widened the breach and the defenders having exploded all their mines rendered themselves vulnerable. Had the troops followed their officers, fourteen of whom managed to climb up near the summit of the bastion and tried to rally them the place would have fallen. Considering the attempt futile Colonel Don, called off the assault and the troops clambered down and fled towards the protection of their battery.

Staying near the left of the approach, a few of the Europeans either mistakenly believed the position was captured or ashamed at the example set by the Sepoys of the Native Infantry advanced. Around forty of them left the trenches and joined the fray only to meet gruesome deaths as one was obliterated by a cannon upon entering the tower's opening, and another cut to pieces at the summit. The survivors joined the fleeing sepoys.

Once again the sorry state of the retreating British forces can be witnessed in Shipp’s recollections of the assault

> No sooner did our brave boys gain the top of the breach, than the well
> directed fire from the fort swept them off. Footing they had none ;
> they literally hung on the bosom of the bastion. A third retreat was
> the result; leaving behind them upwards of five hundred dead and
> wounded: indeed, they might all be said to be dead, for death was
> inevitable.

Lt-Colonel Taylor's column of 300 men fell in with a body of cavalry and was exposed to heavy fire due to a mistake on part of their guide. Their attempt to force the Bhim Narayan Gate resulted in an abject failure due to the further loss of their scaling ladders and the dismounting of a 12-pounder cannon by a shot from the fort.

Only the center column led by Capt Grant comprising 200 soldiers from H. M. 86th Foot and a Bengal N.I. battalion achieved some successand managed to surprise an outpost just outside the fort which fell due negligence of Holkar’s troops who following the sally out were “negligently busy in eating and drinking”. The fall of the outpost resulted in the loss of 11 Guns (one according to Waqai Holkar) with Lieutenants Lanphier and D'Aguilar distinguishing themselves, the former being wounded in the neck by a spear.

This is also verified by the memoirs of Amir Khan Pindari

> “Jones's army as they fled through the Jhao-jungul, where they could
> not form line or avail themselves of their tactics, and so they were
> further broken and dispersed: many of the enemy were slaughtered by
> the swords and spears of Holkur's men, and he returned into camp elate
> with the victory. The men of his brigades took the same opportunity to
> storm one of the English batteries, and captured and brought away
> three or four guns which the enemy had neglected to defend properly
> (not mentioned by other accounts). These they dragged into their own
> lines. But after the general assault was over, an English Commandant
> of Artillery, watching his opportunity when the men in Holkar's
> battery were cooking, made an attack on them and carried the battery,
> recovering his own guns, and capturing all the Muharaj's that were
> there besides.”

The column attempted to pursue the fugitives right upto the gates but failed to enter as they were closed in the nick of time by the defenders. Waqai Holkar mentions the alertness of the Jat defenders in contrast to those manning the outpost “Raja Ranjit Singh's soldiers were on the alert and fire was opened upon the assailants from the top of the bastions”. Additionally the “lack of artillery” further prevented the assaulting column from forcing the gate. In the meantime the remaining soldiers of the 86th and Sepoys alongside a party of Artillerymen detached by Captain Pennington attempted to drag the captured guns to their camp but came under assault by a sally out on part of the defenders who tried to retake the guns.

The sally out however was beaten back by the soldiers who proceeded to form a square under Captain Grant around the guns and successfully dragged them back to camp. In recognition for their valour Lord Lake directed the captured guns to be placed in front of the camp of the regiment as a mark of distinction for the corps and the Bombay division. The position overcome by the column was also named “Grant's post” in honour of the officer commanding the column.

Regardless of this minor victory the dismal outcome of the assault is apparent from a letter written by Lord Lake himself

> “I am sorry that neither of the other columns succeeded. Lieutenant
> Colonel Don's was unfortunately delayed by some unexpected
> circumstances, and on its arrival at the ditch, it was found to
> contain such a depth of water as to render it impossible to gain the
> breach. The troops immediately attempted to ascend by the bastion, but
> the obstacles they met with were of so serious a nature, that their
> utmost efforts were unsuccessful, though the colours of the 12th
> Native Infantry were planted within a short distance from the top.”
>
> “The column from the Bombay division under Lieutenant Colonel Taylor,
> notwithstanding every exertion, could not effect its object. They were
> considerably delayed in their march by a large body of the enemy's
> horse, and by a mistake on the part of their guide, were very early
> exposed to a most heavy and destructive fire from the town, which by
> destroying their ladders, rendered the attack on the gate
> impracticable, and obliged Lieutenant Colonel Taylor to withdraw his
> men under cover, until he received orders to return to camp.”

3 officers and 162 men were killed and 25 officers and 732 men wounded in the third disastrous attempt to storm the fort.

**Fourth Storm**

Convinced that if the bastion assaulted on the previous day was bombarded for half a day it would easily be stormed, Lord Lake bombarded the fort till the next day. He then addressed his men to raise their dampened spirits and selected 200 volunteers led by Lt Templeton who vowed to “place Old England's banner on their haughty bastion, or die in the attempt!” to lead the assault. A reward of 100 rupees each was promised if they succeeded.

The assault commenced once again at 4 P.M.

> “Sergeant, it is with sincere regret I again see you wounded, and
> again at the head of your little band of heroes. I will not check
> your praiseworthy spirit ; go into glory, my lads, and may Heaven
> prosper your zeal, and crown you with triumph !” His lordship
> addressed every corps that passed him; but when the remnant of the two
> companies of the 22nd regiment marched by, he was seen to turn from
> them, and the tear fell down his cheek; but, fearful it might be
> observed, he took off his hat and cheered them. This was not the tear
> of Judas, for his lordship often shed tears of sorrow for our great
> loss at this place.

The Storming Party consisted of H. M. 65th, 76th, and 86th Regiments; flank Companies of H. M. 22nd; the 1st Battalion 2nd and 15th Regiments of N.I. and the Bombay Grenadier Battalion headed by the European Troops, and commanded by Col. Monson.They passed the general and after greeting him with a round of cheers commenced the assault.

Once more they attempted to ascendthe steep Bastion but failed to reach there in sufficient numbers. Some soldiers drove their bayonets into the rampart, one above another, and endeavoured to reach the top while others attempted to climb using shot-holes made by gunfire, but at most only two at a time could advance in this manner only to be knocked down by logs of wood, flaming packs of cotton dipped in oil and firepots, bringing down anyone below them.

> “The Engineer Officer, Ensign Jones, placed two short ladders on the
> walls of the Tower, which reached to the top of it; but no one mounted
> them—the number of ladders being insufficient for any united attempt
> at escalade.”

All this time, the defenders kept up a destructive fire mowing down the enemy. Shipp records being told that every man defending the breach was in full armour with a coat, breastplate, shoulder plates, armlets and a helmet and chain face-guard leading to British musket fire having little impact on them. He further records

> “The soldiers in the fort were in chain armour. I speak this from
> positive conviction, for I myself fired at one man three times in the
> bastion, who was not six yards from me, and he did not even bob his
> head.”

Raja Ranjit Singh ever vigilant on hearing news of the attack arrived at the spot and personally led the defenders in beating off the assault. Waqai Holkar makes mention of Holkar's artillery planted near the Mathura Gate preventing the English advance.

Lt. Templeton true to his vow planted the Colours near the summit but was cut down by a defender the very next second; and Major Menzies (Aide-de-camp to Lord Lake) met the same fate while rallying Native Infantry. Shipp records the fate of twelve attackers who ascended the bastion alongside Templeton (also recorded by Waqai Holkar)

> “Of the twelve gallant fellows who composed the third forlorn hope led
> by me, not one returned to reap the proffered reward of the
> commander-in-chief: add to this, the loss of one of the best officers
> in our army, Captain Menzies, of the 22nd grenadier company,
> aid-de-camp to Lord Lake.”

The condition of the British troops can be imagined from what befell Shipp himself as he writes

> “I had not been on the breach more than five minutes, when I was
> struck with a large shot on my back, thrown down from the top of the
> bastion, which made me lose my footing, and I was rolling down

> bottom of the bastion. How I got there in safety, I know not; but,
> when I came to myself, I found I was lying under the breach, with my

>
> **I was much hurt from the fall, my face was severely scorched, my
> clothes much burnt, and all the hair on the back of my head burnt off.
> I for a time could not tell where I was. I crawled to the opposite

> who did not know me. I sat here, quite unable to move, for some little
> time, till a cannonball struck in the ditch, which knocked the mud all
> over me. This added greatly to the elegance of my appearance ; and in
> this state I contrived, somehow or other, to crawl out of the ditch.**
> At this moment the retreat was sounded, after every mortal effort had
> been made in vain.”

After two hours of combat, the assault was called off for the last time, with 6 officers and 125 men killed and 28 officers and 862 men wounded. The scaling-ladders, and many of the British wounded were left abandoned.

The fate of the wounded was a tragic one, John Pester narrates the take of what befell a Captain of the Bombay division

> “Captain Moreton's case was a very melancholy one; he lost his leg,
> and was also shot by a grape through the body; the anguish of his
> wounds were so cruel that he prevailed on a servant to carry him his
> pistols, with one of which he shot himself, but not effectually, and
> in this horrid state, poor fellow; he lived nearly one whole day-and
> then expired, in agonies too shocking to be described.”

Soon enough the retreat was ordered which swiftly turned into a chaotic rush for cover as everyone dashed towards the trenches, with the defender’s guns wreaking havoc on the fleeing ranks. Amidst the chaos, a Grenadier, a private in Her Majesty's 65th Regiment, was hit and his leg shattered by a cannonball. Despite his desperate cries for aid he was all but abandoned to his fate by his panicked comrades who under severe artillery fire, ignored him.

The soldier no doubt would have been killed in a Jat sally like many before him had it not been for the bravery of Lieutenant Cleiland, who dashed from the trenches and despite the ground around him being torn apart by gunfire managed to hoist the injured man onto his back and bring him to safety.

> \- The Siege of Bhurtpoor. A Poem by a Subaltern of the Field Army

Following the repulse Ranjit Singh rewarded his men for the gallant defence and distributed alms.

On 23rd February, the defenders burned down the British batteries and the following day, Lord Lake formally abandoned the siege of Bharatpur with a total loss of 103 officers and 3,100 men. Such was the loss of the British that the battlefield was described by a text as “a tulip bed” due to the number of dead British in their characteristic red coats.

> Shyam Mai Katthu Mal fought like Rustam on the Nim Darwaza side. Karam
> Singh Thakur, in charge of the Atalband Darwaza. fought well ; Thakur
> Kesri Singh at the Bhim Narayan Darwaza ; repulsed the attack. Kumar
> Randhir Singh at the Shamsher Darwaza and Kumar Pirthi Singh at the
> Fat(e)h Burj repulsed the English and (Randhir) slew many of them.
> Pirthi Singh discharged so many musket shots that the field of combat
> looked like a tulip bed \[with fallen red coats\]

The victory, nevertheless, was not without a cost. The “History of the Bharatpur Raj family” by Fransoo recounts the martyrdom of chiefs like Thakur Dula Ram who sallied out and repulsed the enemy at Anar Darwaza killing a few English officers of note. While valiant officers Akhi Singh Purohit, Balha faujdar and Nur Muhammad sacrificed their lives facing British gunfire. One of the Raja’s brothers too reportedly died as a result of British artillery fire in the course of the siege directed by Captain Nelly between the first and second storm while inspecting the bodies of the fallen British soldiers. Ranjit Singh’s own son was wounded by a British shell in the same time period.

A letter from Dada Krishna Sapre to Ramchander Baba dated month of Vaisakh 15th day of increase gives an exaggerated account of the siege

> “As to our affairs here our supporter is near Bhurtpore. ***Lately the
> English made four or five attacks on Bhurtpore. They were very severe
> of the English side Thousand of officers, Telingas and Hindustanti
> troops were killed. The English being defeated deserted their
> battalions (at?) Bhurtpore and retreated six or seven Coss in the
> direction of Agra. Our army was close on their rear and will cut them
> up.***
>
> Our supporter will firmly establish the Hindoo faith and will reduce
> lakhs to his authority. To effect this he cares not for his life and
> courageously attacks every one. His Horse in battle received 7 or 8
> shots and fell but the hand of God preserved our supporter. The
> Battalions of Ujjain had joined those of Bhurtpore and are also
> annihilated. Lord Lake and all his officers were killed (a false
> exaggeration). Our Army the Nawab Mir Khan and the Pindaries will
> enter the Doab cross the Jumna and establish themselves in the Company
> & territories. Dowlat Rao went to Dhoulpore to meet our supporter.
> They will quickly join or have already done. Jesht (?j Sahib and
> Jeslal Singh are now near Mandosir. Our supporter night and day exerts
> himself to establish his authority. By the aid of Shree Martand
> Maharaj the all powerful, this will be perfected.”

**Impact of the Battle**

Despite the victory, Ranjit Singh eventually made terms with the British. Yet, the impact of this siege went far beyond his borders.

In the Anglo-Nepalese war, Bada Kazi Amar Singh Thapa using it as an example to inspire his countrymen. in a letter written in 1815 to his sons wrote

> “The English attempted to take Bhurtpoor by storm; but the Raja
> Runjeet Singh destroyed an European regiment , and a battalion of
> sepoys . To the present day they have not ventured to meddle with
> Bhurtpoor again.”

A later account by Hansukh Rai too commemorated the event in his Majma'ul Akhbar

> “When, in the latter part of the year, the British, after reducing,
> through the wisdom of their policy and sagacity, the strong forts of
> Dig and Kishangarh, gallantly determined to take the fort of Bhartpur,
> he with a valiant body of Jats marched boldly to resist them. It is
> said that these Jats, in spite of the superior strength of the
> British, fell upon them regardless of life as moths of fire, committed
> great slaughter, and thus displayed their valour to the admiration of
> all who witnessed or heard of the fact.”

General James Welsh of the Madras Army in his memoirs too recalled how battle became a source of mockery for the EIC

> “From the time of Lord Lake's failure against this place, it had never
> ceased to be thrown in our teeth by the Natives, in every part of the
> East ; and many a man, in conversing about our successes, has silenced
> me in a moment, by saying “All this may be very, true, but can you,
> take Bhurtpoor?”

Harnam Singh, a Sarsuti Brahmin in his SA'ADAT JAWED states

> War raged for seven months between the English on one part and Raja
> Ranjit Singh and Jaswant Rao Holkar on the other, and more than
> fifteen thousand men were killed on both sides. The daily conflicts
> before Bhartpur form a narrative which is worth hearing, and on both
> sides such courage was shown as threw the chivalric stories of the
> ancients into oblivion. " Such battles nobody had seen in the world,
> nor the wisest men of the whole earth had heard of."

John Pester would go on to describe the withdrawal as thus

> “The British arms in this part of the world had never before
> experienced such a check and a loss so severe, and without carrying
> our point. We were summoned again this evening to attend the remains
> of more of our friends to their graves; some of the poor fellows were
> yesterday performing the same office to those who had fallen the day
> before, although they did not themselves live to see the setting of
> that sun. Hammond of our Battalion and Major Ratcliffe of the 12th
> died this evening of their wounds, as did also Captain Moreton of the
> Bombay Division, and several other officers, and we apprehended that
> Hawkes could not long survive. The ball went in at his right shoulder,
> passed through his body and out at the left shoulder.”

`Note: While the author exerted every effort to incorporate both contemporary and indigenous sources to cover the siege, fiscal limitations and the inherent constraints of the digital medium precluded access to native texts such as Waqai Bharatpur by Munshi Dhunkal Singh, Tarikh-i Bharatpur or Zafar Namah, and Makhzan-ul-Futūh by Bhagwan Das. Similarly, English resources like the invaluable Diary of James Young, remained beyond reach due to budgetary restrictions. `

`Nonetheless, this narrative stands as the most comprehensive account of the siege to date with multiple British diaries, journals and memoirs being used aside from contemporary Maratha dispatches, Persian memoirs and compositions. `

`I regret any grammatical errors that may be present. Writing the article was an exhausting endeavour, and such errors will be rectified in due course.`
