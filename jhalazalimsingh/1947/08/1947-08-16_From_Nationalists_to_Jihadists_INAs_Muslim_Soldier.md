Contrary to the popular view that the forces which invaded Kashmir in 1947 consisted solely of Tribal Marauders often termed as Qabailis stiffened with a bunch of Pakistani regulars, the reality is far more complex and ambiguous. The conflict saw the deployment of a range of forces on various occasions by Pakistan to achieve it’s ends comprising regulars, semi regulars and irregulars which intermixed with each other as the war progressed leading to blurring of boundaries between these forces. Therefore to fully comprehend the pivotal role played by Muslim Ex-INA personnel it is important to first distinguish between various parties that actually took part in the conflict on the side of the Pakistani invaders.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

***A Mujahid in the “Kashmir Jihad” gives a call for Azam, 1st Kashmir War***

The broad distinctions between the various forces are aptly summarised by the “Appx ‘A’ to HQ Western Command Intelligence Summary No.34” dated 19 June 1948. Titled “Notes On Enemy Organisation And Tactics” it classified the enemy faced by Indian troops into three general types, namely:

-   The Azad Kashmir Fauj

-   The Scouts or the Frontier Constabulary

-   Regular Pak Troops

Each one of these was studied separately and as stated by the report had a separate organisation and were equipped differently from each other and utilised different tactics.

However following the Pakistani designations itself we shall add another category by distinguishing the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces and the Azad Kashmir Forces:

-   **Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF):** These included Muslim
    elements of Jammu and Kashmir State Forces who had defected enmasse
    after breaking their oaths and killing their former Hindu/Sikh
    comrades in cold blood across the state, ex-servicemen from either
    the British Indian Army or State forces as well as civil volunteers.

    The description of the Azad Kashmir Fauj in the Intelligence Summary
    primarily refers to these troops when it says

    > “The recruitment is mostly from deserters from Pak Army, and
    > released pers from the ex Ind Army, The men are mostly Punchies
    > and Kashmiris, though there are a few PMs and Pathans too. After
    > emergency trg from 20 days to a month in musketry, the recruits
    > are sent to the bns and on to the front. Their org appears to be
    > similar to ours, i.e. bdes, bns and coys roughly the same str as
    > in the Ind army. There are however NO fixed ests. **AKF is
    > officered by ex Ind Army JCOs, offr deserters of the KASHMIR State
    > forces, and ex INA offrs.**”

-   **Azad Kashmir Forces (AKF):** The forces included tribal raiders
    composed of Lashkars from various groups such as the Mahsuds,
    Waziris, Mohmands, Orakzais, Turis, Mangals, Zadrans, Maqbuls,
    Gurbaz, Khattaks, Bittanis, Ghilzais, and Rajouris. Additionally,
    the Yousafzais, Bangash, and Hazara tribes from distant Balochistan
    joined the conflict, alongside Zadrans, Sulemankhels, Ahmadzais, and
    Ghilzais from regions straddling the Durand Line, which demarcates
    Afghanistan and Pakistan. Combatants from Dir, Swat, and Chitral
    also entered the fray, accompanied by Pakistani volunteers, troops
    from princely states that had acceded to Pakistan, among others.

    A number of foreigners also participated in the war on the Muslim
    side. They included Brigadier Russell, an American, Mr. Auckland, a
    Finish Engineer, Mr. Noel Green, of the Royal Indian Air Force,
    Mr. R. Anderson, a Burmese Engineer, 2 Lt Harry Rehenarz, a German
    volunteer and Mr. Muhammad Al Arabi, an Arab. But neither their
    numbers nor their impact was sufficient enough to categorise them
    separately.

The narratives and accounts surrounding the conflict often give vague references to "Pathan Raiders" or Pakistan Army soldiers. However, it is crucial to recognise that while Pakistani regulars did participate alongside the invaders, (as highlighted later), the initial brunt of the combat—and consequently the majority of the atrocities—were perpetrated by the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF) or under their oversight. This was particularly evident in the regions of Bhimber, Kotli, Rajouri, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Poonch amongst other places. The Pakistan Army only engaged in the conflict in significant numbers from May 1948 onwards.

`[Note: The author in no way implies that the Pakistan Army is in any way an actor incapable of taking part in such horrors as seen in Kashmir in 1947-48. A look at the atrocities committed in erstwhile East Pakistan during Operation Searchlight provides sufficient evidence as to their true nature]`

### WHY THE INA?

Before we get to the scale and size of the participation of ex-INA elements in the conflict it’s important to understand why they were taken. A lot of this section is just conjecture on the author’s part so feel free to skip ahead.

***Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Maj Gen AC Chatterjee alongside Maj Gen Mohammed Zaman Kiani and Col Habibur Rahman the future C-in-C and Chief of Staff of Azad Kashmir Regular Forces***

Many of the INA were defectors from the British Indian Army and had already received training for conventional operations under them after which they switched sides and joined the INA. Here they were divided into Guerilla Regiments fighting without any armoured or artillery support and with poor logistics and limited ammunition. Medical resources too were next to none.

To quote Shah Nawaz Khan

> “INA Guerrilla brigades had no artillery or mortar covering fire
> support nor did they have any wireless or telephonic communications.
> Machine guns were very deficient of belts and magazines. There were no
> optical or other instruments and no spare parts for machine guns were
> available nor was there any animal or mechanical transport available
> for carrying these weapons across the country.
>
> Medical arrangements within the brigade were very inadequate. There
> were only five medical officers to look after the 3000 men. They had
> to be split up to form advance and base Regimental hospitals Doctors
> had particularly no surgical instruments and very little medicine.
> There was also a great shortage of clothing and boots. Some of the
> soldiers had to do jungle warfare training barefooted in the most

They had no regular field battery or artillery and the few carriers and armoured cars which they possessed never left Singapore and were only used for propaganda purposes. The Indian National Army in Burma had only two companies of motor transport consisting of old and worn out civilian lorries.

While it had static battles thrust upon it the INA was originally intended to fight a Guerrilla war as stated by Maj Gen AC Chatterjee:

> “Consultations were held with the Japanese military authorities with
> regard to the training that would be suitable for the troops of the
> Azad Hind Fauj in the role they would play in the coming campaign on
> the Indo-Burma frontier. It was mutually decided that in view of the
> smaller number of the troops as well as of their greater suitability,
> the Azad Hind Fauj would carry on guerilla warfare. This meant that
> they would have to largely depend upon their own initiative, but would
> keep contact with the Japanese units which might be operating in their
> neighbourhood. They had to be extremely mobile as they might have to
> carry out raids and operate behind the enemy lines even up a depth of
> fifty miles. For this reason they had to be lightly equipped and would
> have to live off the country in which they were operating. For this
> purpose they would have to establish close relationship with the
> people of the country. Even the medical branches for the treatment and
> evacuation of the sick were made to suit the guerilla warfare which
> the troops were going to adopt. With this object in view, all the
> training that was carried out and the equipment that was provided were
> meant for guerilla operations.”

The conditions in Kashmir were anticipated to mirror those of the Burmese campaign unless Indian forces intervened to decisively shift the balance, compelling the Pakistan Army to formally enter the conflict as well. The plan relied on conducting guerrilla warfare against the Jammu and Kashmir state forces while facing poor logistics and minimal support from conventional units in terms of armour, artillery, air power, or even adequate medical facilities. These challenges, however, were areas in which INA veterans possessed extensive experience, drawn from their campaigns in Burma.

***Mujahideen busy in preparing meals for their comrades during the Kashmir jihad***

A look at Maj Gen AC Chatterjee’s (as narrated to him personally by Kiani) description of the fighting condition of Col IJ Kiani’s men in Burma where they faced the might of the “British Indian Army” makes Kashmir look like a cake walk :

> “The men had gone into battle with only ten days’ rations. Sometimes
> several days passed and no rations arrived from the Japanese
> authorities. There was complete lack of transport for bags of rice,
> ammunition, and other material when they arrived at the Supply Depot
> located about three miles further north-west of Chamole near the main
> road to carry them to the Headquarters nearly 15 miles from the depot.
> All these had to be carried on the backs of the men which resulted not
> only in the men breaking down with fatigue……”
>
> “Moreover, they did not have a sufficient number of ground sheets or
> waterproofs to protect them from the rain which was setting in. On
> account of the shortage of rations the men had to take to cooking
> grass, roots of trees and leaves of some trees that were available.
> Sometimes they went into the villages and brought some paddy which
> they boiled and took. He had also been experiencing another very great
> difficulty, which was the lack of sufficient means of communication.
> The Japanese had promised telephone or wireless communication, but
> they had failed so far to supply them directly to the units.
> Messengers had to go through the Japanese lines miles apart, and the
> difficulty of language”

In contrast the “Jihad” in Kashmir was backed by Pakistani regulars since its inception which sent troops in Mufti to fight alongside the Irregulars while officially declaring them as being on leave or deserters contrary to Pakistani claims that the Pakistani Army only joined the conflict in May 1948 sufficient.

At Mirpur the forces under Sector Commander Col RM Arshad (Ex INA) were again supported by troops from the PAVO Cavalry whose combat group was equipped with one troop of 3 - inch mortars , twelve machine guns on ground mountings taken out of the armoured vehicles and wireless sets.

Not only direct armed support but even medical support was arranged in Kashmir directly by the Pakistan Army Medical Corps (PAMC) as early as December 1947 with Capt Altaf Hussain arriving at at 1 Azad Kashmir Field Hospital Kakuta with two regimental panniers full of medical stores.

It is ironic that Pakistani writers like to present the First Kashmir War as a war of a rustic Tribal from the North West Frontier bravely resisting and taking on a disciplined yet menacing Dogra force backed by “RSS and fanatical Akalis” with superior firepower and discipline. However the reality cannot be more further away from this assertion. Their initial opponents the Jammu and Kashmir state forces were an emasculated force devoid of any artillery, air or armoured support having transferred two of their Mountain batteries to the British Indian Army in 1942 itself.

Additionally the state faced an acute ammunition shortage, traditionally supplied by the British Government, until the Pakistani government halted this provision. Forced to rely on depleted reserves, the state sought assistance from the Indian Government. On October 10 1947, Lieutenant Colonel Bhagwan Singh was tasked with submitting an urgent requisition for arms, ammunition, and equipment, including supplies for two mountain batteries. Despite approval from the Home and Defence Ministers, bureaucratic delays and obstruction by British officers in key Army Headquarters roles stalled the release of resources, leaving the state vulnerable before the Pakistani invasion.

Curiously enough the Pakistani "irregulars" managed to secure armoured support as early as October, well before the Jammu and Kashmir State forces could achieve the same.

When the Azad forces, led by Brigadier Habibur Rahman (Ex INA), repeatedly faltered in their attempts to capture Bhimber, armored cars from the 11th Cavalry supported by a mortar troop and a section of ground-mounted machine guns were deployed to break through the Dogra defenses. This strategic maneuver was further corroborated by aerial reconnaissance, as affirmed by Brigadier LP Sen:

> “Survivors from the Bhimbar garrison stated that after they had beaten

***Armoured Cars of 11th Cavalry securing Bagsar Fort***

The most critical vulnerability faced by the force was the significant presence of Muslim troops within its ranks, whose loyalties were precarious—a reality the state remained oblivious to. Battalions with a mixed composition, such as the 4th Battalion, comprising 50 percent Muslim personnel, were stationed in the strategically vital Muzaffarabad-Kohala sector. Similarly, the 6th Battalion, with an identical composition, was tasked with relieving the all-Hindu 5th Battalion in the Gilgit-Ladakh sector, while the 2nd Battalion, also 50 percent Muslim, was positioned in the pivotal Mirpur-Kotli sector.

***Betrayed, abandoned and forgotten:** The contributions of J&K State forces & their determined resistance in the face of heavy odds is often forgotten. Here in the picture are State Forces troops guarding a hill feature "Salotri" outside Poonch, during the link-up operations.*

This was something taken into account by Pakistani planners. General Tariq’s description of his plan entitled “Armed Revolt inside Kashmir’ mentions

> “The Maharajah’s Army was said to be about 9,000 strong of which the
> 2,000 or so ***Muslims could be expected to remain comparatively
> passive or even to desert if all went well***. The remaining 7,000
> were believed to be widely scattered and could be overcome by the
> Kashmiri people little by little.”

This indeed proved to be the case, as Muslim ex-officers and soldiers of the State Forces flocked to join the rebels while serving Muslim personnel betrayed their unsuspecting Hindu and Sikh comrades, massacring them in cold blood before facilitating the enemy's advance and defecting to their ranks.

The scale of this treachery is beyond the scope of this article, but to provide some context, by December 1947, 659 Muslim officers and men from the State Forces had defected to the enemy—excluding those in Gilgit, which included two companies of Muslim troops from the 6th Battalion. Notably, two of these officers, Capt. Rehmat Ullah (2 JAKRIF) and Capt. Hassan Khan (6 JAKRIF), later rose to the rank of sector commanders.

***List of deserters from Jammu and Kashmir State Forces excluding those from 6th J&K Rifles (Atleast 2 Companies)***

It is striking to note the parallels between the oft-cited examples of Hindu-Muslim unity in both the Indian National Army (INA) and the J&K State Forces. The 4th Battalion of the State Forces, which handed over the Muzaffarabad region to the enemy and betrayed its own comrades, was ironically described as having

>
> “Besides having fought shoulder to shoulder against the Japanese, the

Gen AC Chatterjee mentions how the INA did away with British traditions and

***“Do’s and Don’ts for the Officers and men in the Indian National Army” Probably every principle especially those regarding religion, honour of women, discipline and unity would have been violated in Kashmir 1947-48***

Many of these former INA officers besides understanding the nuances of guerrilla warfare brought with them extensive experience in senior command roles, often possessing greater military leadership and battle expertise than many serving or retired British Indian Army personnel. This was partly due to the fact that necessity forced the INA to promote personnel to higher ranks—NCOs were elevated to JCOs, while JCOs advanced to officer positions. Those who had previously served as Captains or Majors in the British Indian Army were entrusted with directing battles at the divisional level.

While one might argue that this approach was far from ideal, the undeniable fact remains that these individuals had firsthand experience commanding operations on a scale that few native officers or JCOs in the British Indian Army could claim. Some of these officers like Col TM Khanzada & Maj Muhammad Hussain who had fought for 3 different armies won awards for bravery in all three!!

Consequently, they were regarded as the most qualified candidates to lead and oversee operations in Kashmir. This was particularly crucial given the constraints on deploying high-ranking serving officers from the Pakistan Army during the initial stages, necessitating that ex-servicemen and demobilised troops do the heavy lifting.

Their better training, experience and discipline in comparison to the tribesmen, who are often unfairly blamed for the entire invasion can be seen in Akbar Khan’s memoirs. As General “Tariq” recounts in his book, following the decisive Battle of Shalateng—a battle dismissed by Pakistanis—every single tribesman had fled, relinquishing all the territorial gains they had made. Reflecting on how the terrain might have favored the Pakistani forces had the tribesmen not retreated, he writes:

> “So far as their (Indian) one brigade was concerned, two or three
> hundred Mahsuds, if provided with commissariat arrangements, could
> keep it halted where it was for many many weeks. Yet the tribesmen had
> not stopped to do so. ***Only one small group of volunteers, formerly
> of the I.N.A. (Indian National Army), remained on the road—some miles
> away from the enemy, acting as a watching post***”

To take a few examples of Ex-INA veterans who fought on the Pakistani side in the War

***Maj Gen MZ Kiani***

***General Zaman Kiani*** had won the Sword of Honour & Gold Medal for the most outstanding Cadet in 1935 from the Indian Military Academy. He held a variety of appointments in the INA including the Chief of General Staff, Army Commander as well as the commander of No. 1 Division which was sent to fight in Burma early in 1944. On return from the front in October, 1944, he was appointed General Secretary to the War Council and even accompanied Netaji to Tokyo in 1944.

Shah Nawaz Khan describes his capabilities as follows

***Brig Habib ur Rehman***

***Brig Habib ur Rehman*** too held multiple appointments serving as the Adjutant General in the INA Headquarters and later on took over as commandant of the officers’ Training School of the INA. In the words of Shah Nawaz

> “it was here that he made a name for himself. In a very brief space of

In May 1944, Netaji appointed him as Assistant Chief of Staff and directed him to report to his headquarters in Rangoon. He had previously accompanied Netaji to Tokyo and returned with him to Rangoon in January 1943. By March 1945, he was entrusted with the command of all I.N.A. forces in Singapore, relieving General Bhonsle, who was needed in Rangoon. A member of the War Council, he was, in August 1945, the sole I.N.A. officer accompanying Netaji at the time his plane crashed and he reportedly passed away.

***Col Mata-ul-Mulk***

***Col Mata-ul-Mulk*** a relation of Lt-Col. Burhan-ud Din also served as the Reinforcement Group Commander which was to operate in conjunction with INA’s Special Forces units namely the Bahadur and Intelligence Groups. There exists the following description for the outfit:

***Indian Study on Enemy tactics in Kashmir mentioning INA***

Thus these officers were uniquely equipped to respond to the Pakistani needs in Kashmir. The last and the most crucial factor was the fact that they were not serving soldiers of the Pakistani Armed Forces which allowed for plausible deniability. As stated by Yusuf Saraf

> “Mr Kiani was now in touch with the Government leaders at Lahore about

> anything on the official level because of the fear that it may provoke
> an Indo- Pakistan war. It was therefore considered expedient to use

> volunteers.”

This is echoed by Akbar Khan or better known by his nom de Guerre General Tariq

> “It was desirable that some trained personnel should be available for
> the organisation and coordination of the whole effort. No army
> officers could be taken for this, but we had in Pakistan some of the
> senior ex-army officers of the I.N.A. (Indian National Army) who might

According to Yusuf Saraf, General Kiani had established communication with the government leaders in Lahore regarding the escalating situation in Kashmir and had meticulously devised a strategic plan to address it. This was promptly handed over to the relevant authorities and was already in their possession when the first high-level meeting took place at the Government House in Lahore on 12th September, 1947.

This critical meeting, convened at 6 p.m. involved persons no less than the Prime Minister Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan alongside other prominent figures, including Mr. Ghulam Muhammad, the Finance Minister at the time, Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din, Mr. Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan, the Nawab of Mamdot, Ch. Mohammad Ali, Mr. Khurshid Anwar, and Colonel Akbar Khan. General Kiani was in attendance as well.

The three-tier plan envisaged

\(1\) preparation of armed bands in Poonch who were to advance upon Srinagar

\(2\) a network of an underground movement was to be organised in the Valley to rise in revolt at an appropriate hour

\(3\) in order to prevent any substantial help from reaching the State from India, the Kathua - Jammu road was to be harassed and disturbed.

The plan also envisaged the deployment of officers and personnel from the Indian National Army to operate from across the Punjab border with a sum of Rs. 10,000 was allocated to General Kiani to initiate the operations.

It was upon Kiani’s recommendation that Khwaja Abdur Rahim, an experienced ICS officer, was appointed as Commissioner of Rawalpindi. This strategic move was made to ensure the presence of a dynamic and reliable officer, particularly as the border districts of Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, and the tehsil of Murree fell under the jurisdiction of the Rawalpindi Commissionerate. The officer in question was reportedly responsible for supplying the forces with everything they needed, "from a needle to a gun."

At this stage, Colonel Akbar was not yet directly involved, and the entirety of the operation was entrusted to General Kiani, with the exception of the Kohala-Muzaffarabad sector, which was assigned to Khurshid Anwar (though Ex-INA personnel were present in operations in that sector as well).

The “History of the Azad Kashmir Regiment” states that

> “In the first week of November, 1947, Brig (later Maj Gen) Muhammad
> Zaman Kiani was appointed Commander of Azad Forces with Col (later
> Brig) Habib ur Rehman as his Chief of Staff. Headquarters of Brig
> Kiani, which had already been set up, was upgraded and designated as
> Forces Headquarters AKRF and assigned the responsibility of organising
> the Mujahideen into Azad Army units.”

By the 23rd of September, all Sector Headquarters as well as the Main Head-quarter started functioning. The Main Headquarter was set up at Gujrat whereas Sector Headquarters were set up at Rawalpindi and Sialkot to start with and a little later, at Jhelum, for the districts of Poonch, Jammu and Mirpur, respectively.

-   Col. Khanzada was put incharge of Pindi Sector

-   Col. Arshad took charge of the Jhelum Sector.

-   Col. IJ Kiani was put incharge of the Sialkot Sector and initially
    had 8 ex-INA officers under Kiani alongside a few hundred men also
    former INA but with other volunteers, particularly from tehsil
    Khushab.

    The Sector's primary task was to disrupt the enemy movement on the
    Jammu-Kathua road in order to delay the build-up of his forces west
    of Chenab and by the 2nd of October he started operations towards
    the south of Samba.

General Zaman Kiani also met and coordinated with Maulana Abul-Ala Maududi of ***Jamaat-e-Islami***, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmed of the Ahmadiyya sect, and representatives from several relief organizations in Lahore to seek material support. Although 4,000 locally crafted rifles and condemned ammunition were provided by Colonel Khanzada, essential supplies such as water bottles, footwear, haversacks, transport, and provisions were still unavailable. To address this Kiani along with a few colleagues, scoured Lahore’s markets, gathering whatever second-hand, army surplus materials they could find.

Additionally, Kiani conducted an aerial reconnaissance of the area by flying over the Pathankote-Kathua route in the personal plane of Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmed. Reports of similar flights also emerge over river Jhelum from Kohala Plundari and back (4-10-1947) with an aeroplane reported flying regularly over areas of Bagh etc (6-10-1947) amongst other incidents. Incidentally Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmed would later play a key role in the establishment of the Furqan Force, which was deployed in June 1948.

With the establishment of these Force headquarters, the entire operational area—spanning from Gilgit-Baltistan in the north to Jammu-Kathua in the south—was strategically divided into sectors, each placed under the command of seasoned officers. Besides the fact that General Muhammad Zaman Kiani served as the Commander of the Azad Forces, with Colonel (later Brigadier) Habib ur Rehman acting as his Chief of Staff, former Indian National Army (INA) personnel held pivotal leadership roles throughout the Kashmir "jihad."

By the war's conclusion, ***out of the twelve operational sectors nearly half*** had been at various times under the command of ex-INA officers:

1.  **Bagh** was commanded by Hav (later Maj) Sardar Muhammad Abdul
    Qayyum Khan, with Capt (later Lt Col) Muhammad Tajammal Hussain Khan
    (ex INA)

2.  **Mirpur** was under Lt Col Raja Muhammad Arshad (ex INA).

3.  **Bhimber-Chhamb** Col (later Brig) Habib ur Rehman Khan (ex INA)

4.  **Jammu - Kathua** Lt Col Inayat Ullah Kiani (ex INA)

5.  **Sudhnuti-Kotli :** was briefly commanded by with Raja Sakhi Daler
    (allegedly Ex INA) followed by Lt Col Taj Muhammad Khanzada (Ex INA)

Moreover while INA officers didn’t hold the commands of other Sectors this hardly implies that they did not hold important subordinate positions there or did not participate in the battles or orgy of massacres.

For example RAJCOL Sector Headquarters was under Maj Muhammad Aslam and Capt Shahpal, the latter was Ex-INA. In his book “the Withering Chinar” Lt Col Haq attributed Rajouri’s loss to the mishandling of the situation by the Jarral clan. Out of four individuals blamed for the debacle two namely Maj Shah Pal Qureshi and Lt Col Sher Pal Qureshi hailing from the Kotli area were ex-INA.

In the Northern Areas Sector, Col Burhan-ud-Din and Col Mata-u-Mulk brought in and commanded the Chitral State Forces consisting of the Mehtar’s Bodyguard and the Chitral Scouts. Their most seminal contribution was the bringing in of four 3.7-inch howitzer guns which were initially used to bombard the fort of Skardu whose gallant defenders held out for 6 months and 3 days. By June 1948, Col Mata ul Mulk and his men had taken over the siege of Skardu and was the Commander of the Pakistani forces when the garrison surrendered on the 14th of August 1948 and was subsequently massacred alongside civilians.

***Letter From the Governor of NWFP recording Chitrali military support under Col Burhan ud Din***

In the Haveli Sector the 21 Azad Kashmir Battalion or the 2nd Farooqi raised by Raja Gulam Mohi ud Din at Sadhroon (consisting of just 200 civilians with Darra made rifles) was transformed into a potent force by Sub (later Maj) Khazin Shah, ex INA, who had come with a Pathan lashkar from Kohat and taken over the Battalion.

In the next couple of days he was joined by ex-servicemen Mubarik Shah and Abdul Manan joined Sub Khazin Shah who by the end of June, 1948 inducted about 600 men and completed the raising. To quote the History of the Azad Kashmir Regiment

> “The three Mujahideen commanders, with their ex INA experience,
> trained the young volunteers in a short span of time upto the required
> level.”

Moreover INA veterans also played a vital role in other arenas of the conflict such as the establishment of Training Centres. For example out of the 4 Primary training centres of the AKRF established for training civilian volunteers and replacing casualties recognised by the Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir the Training Centre Jatli in Mirpur were established by the ex-INA officer Brig Habib ur Rehman. Another Training Centre Harigehl (Bagh) was established by Hav (later Maj) Sardar Muhammad Abdul Qayyum Khan with whose force Lt Col Tajammal Hussain ex-INA remained in advisory capacity. Hussain also went on to command the 4th and 7th Azad Kashmir Brigades in the War.

Overall control of the Training Centres including promotions etc, remained with Forces Headquarters AKRF under Maj Gen Muhammad Zaman Kiani, C-in-C AKRF with Brig Habib ur Rehman Khan as his Chief of the Staff. Rehman ironically had also been the Commandant of the **Officers**' **Training School of the Indian National Army.**

We have the testimony of Lt Noor Mohammad who volunteered for the Azad Forces and was assigned the duties of a Quartermaster responsible for drawing rations, clothing, arms and ammunition for his unit from the military depots and was taken POW at Naushera. Out of the four Ordinance Depots & Dumps mentioned by him with the exception of Rawalpindi Ordnance Dump all the other three namely: the Jhelum, Sialkot and Gujarat Ordnance Dumps were under Col Arshad, Col Shahzada Khan and Col Kiani all of whom were Ex-INA.

Additionally the Defence Council under Lt Col Syed Ali Ahmed Shah, had both Gen Muhammad Zaman Kiani and Brig Habib ur Rehman as it’s members. Self styled Col Dilawar Khan from the INA who reportedly led the elements laying siege to Mirpur town later became the Defence Secretary of the Azad Kashmir Government. According to Saraf ***atleast 43 officers, from the rank Second Lieutenant and upwards, who had formally served in the Indian National Army played a crucial role in the Kashmir jihad*** and were partially responsible for officering the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF). The number of INA veterans who participated at the JCO and OR level remain unknown.

The Kashmir jihad also saw the participation of women fighters or as the “History of the Azad Kashmir Regiment” refers to them “women Mujahidat”. Four of them Hassan Bibi, Jabra Begum, Hussain Bibi and Khanwan Bibi were killed by the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces, with the last two being awarded the Mujahjid-i-Hydri.

Interestingly enough even spouses of Ex-INA personnel seem to have been eager to do their part in the jihad. Nasira Sidiqi, wife of Gen M Z Kiani though not a member of the Rani Jhansi Regiment was among the women participate in the guard of honour presenting weapons to honour Bose before Kiani ordered her “to sever all connections with the Regiment”. Being a physician she had also conducted some of the medical examinations of recruits of the INA in August and September 1943.

As far as the Kashmir conflict is concerned she had begun her subversive activities before the invasion had even started. Her services to the Kashmir jihad were well recognised for which she was awarded the title of Ghazi-I-Kashmir.

Arriving in Srinagar in early August, she attempted to establish contact with the city leaders of the Muslim Conference alongside Muslim Officers in the Civil and Military wings of the Government. Over time, she transitioned from addressing smaller workers' gatherings to speaking at larger public assemblies within Srinagar. In a letter addressed to “Most respected and revered Hazrat Quaid-i-Azam (Jinnah) Sahib” she gives an overview of the political situation in Kashmir

> “Regarding it as my duty, I came to the Kashmir Valley, with the
> consent of my local leader, to do a bit of work for the Kashmiri
> Muslims' in collaboration with the Muslim Conference. I met many
> members and workers of the Conference and ascertained the situation.
>
> “Rumour in the Muslim Conference circles has it that the Maharajah has
> telegraphed India as well as Pakistan that Kashmir would stay neutral,
> but it is believed that this is mere eyewash and that it has been
> decided to accede to India. The Maharaja's joining the Indian
> Constituent Assembly will portend disaster.
>
> It is now imperative that the Muslim Conference begins to work in real
> earnest, or else all Muslims will be doomed to a sell-out at the hands
> of a few selfish people.”
>
> “The people here had requested the Punjab to help out with four or
> five thousand rupees but there has been no response since there are no
> sincere workers. In fact, I have advised the people here to raise
> tunds locally. Many a tourist has come to Kashmir and there are
> several affluent persons here as well. I have started to organize
> students and women through the Muslim Students Federation and the
> Muslim Conference Women Committee, respectively.”

She was eventually expelled from the state.

However, she continued playing a part in the war reportedly supplying arms and ammunition to the rebels and even sustaining a bullet injury at the Pattan front on October 27, 1947 according to Saraf which necessitated a month-long hospitalisation.

Other INA veterans were decorated as well for their role in the Kashmir Jihad. Raja Sakhi Daler was awarded both the Khadim-i-Din alongside that of Ghazi-i-Kashmir. Col RM Arshad was given the award of Ghazi-i-Kashmir while Capt Sardar Khan was bestowed the Khadim-i-Din

Maj Gen Muhammad Zaman Kiani, Brig Habib ur Rehman Khan, Lt Col Tajammal Hussain Khan, Lt Col Taj Muhammad Khanzada, DSO,MC, Maj Muhammad Hussain, Capt Sikandar Khan to name a few were all bestowed the Fakhr-i-kashmir. There exist many similar individuals however tracing these awards is not an easy task especially amongst the lower ranks while one is confined to the online medium without access to archives and divided borders so I will not be dwelling more on the decorations awarded to INA personnel in the Kashmir war.

INA personnel thus took part in operations ranging from Sub (later Capt) Mehdi Shah (ex INA) providing support to the Khan Battalion (24 Azad Kashmir) in the attack on Naushehra with 20 mortars to Capt Feroze Khan’s a company of Habib Force getting mauled by Indian Armour or Captain Sikandar Khan’s operations in coordination with the Panjal force. Even amongst the 12 Mujahideen with which General Tariq alleges he managed to deceive the Indian forces and delay their advance between Uri and Chakothi for 6 days we find the mention of an INA Subedar. One could go on and on but the purpose of the article is to merely highlight the presence of INA personnel in the war rather than going into and providing an assessment of their military performance.

Commenting on the role of the INA Sharaf remarks

> “Despite all said and done, the truth remains that the tribesmen as
> well as the INA personnel played a brilliant and historic role in the
> Kashmir liberation war. Muzaffarabad district owes it liberation to
> the tribesmen. Mirpur owes is freedom, largely to the INA-manned
> Gujrat HQ as well as the tribesmen from Dir State. Tehsil Bhimber
> also, owes its freedom to the Gujrat HQ.”

In his book “Inside Pak Occupied Kashmir” the journalist P. N. Sharma, a captive with the Pakistani forces provides vivid details of the atrocities he witnessed.

He describes how the raiders had converted the Bawa Mandir into an outpost after removing the idols of this temple with Major Fateh Khan, an ex-I.N.A. officer living there. The disciple of the priest had been forcibly converted to Islam. He writes:

> “The Bawa -Mandir was the headquarters of the Azad Forces in Gujrat.
> Most of the raiders used to live there, and the loot, women and
> children ‘captured from the Jammu area, were kept in all the
> underground ‘store-rooms of the temple.”
>
> “The head priest of this temple, with the help of his servant, had
> escaped during the riots. The disciple of this priest, a young boy,
> very well educated in Sanskrit and Vedas and other religious books,
> was ‘forcibly converted to Islam. He was living there. We were not
> allowed to talk to him.”

The author describes how Major Fateh Khan would violate women in the inner sanctum of the temple where the idol of Lord Shiva was formerly placed

> “As previously mentioned, Major Fateh Khan, Commander of this ‘temple
> camp, who used to live in the place of Gods, used to enjoy and ‘sleep
> with women in that sacred apartment, where formerly Shiva’s idol was
> kept. Various other rooms of this temple were used by the guards ‘for
> committing similar shameful crimes. After we were moved to this
> ‘temple, one day some women were brought in and we were locked in our
> rooms so that we may not be able to see them. We heard the horrible
> cries of these innocent women.....? We could not tolerate this but
> were helpless. We felt like killing the guards but instead we had to
> put up with all this and even feign an air of indifference.
>
> The guards used to blurt out most of the stories and tell us what was
> happening there then. Many prisoners were kept in this temple in
> various corners. They too were often being tortured and we used to
> hear their cries. Some of them were later on shot dead. Michael who
> had freedom of movement because of his insignificance within the
> temple premises, used to come and tell us all that was going on
> there.”

The author had with him a Goan prisoner Michael D’Souza who was attached to them as an orderly. Having pretended to be a Muslim to avoid a brutal end he was allowed free movement throughout the premises and could speak to almost anyone

> “He told us about the women that were brought there in truck-loads
> from the Jammu area, irrespective of their religion. They were dumped
> into the big room like sheep. They were then stripped of their
> jewellery, gold, etc., and stripped naked. They were distributed to
> the raiders of the Azad Forces as comfort girls, according to the rank
> of the raiders and beauty of the unfortunate women. ***The prettiest
> and choicest of them were allotted to the high ranking officers. ‘They
> were taken in the evening to the houses of senior officers and were
> brought back the next morning. These senior officers included Major
> General Kiani, Colonel Habibur Rahman, Colonel Arshad and others, who
> formed the Indian National Army in Japan***.”
>
> “The unwanted girls and old women were kept in a camp in Kunja, a few
> miles from Gujrat. Some of them were converted to Islam and married to
> the raiders who were our guards. But these were temporary marriages.
> Later on the same ‘women were sold to the other guards. Now and then
> they used to come and tell us of these atrocities with pride.”

A class B intelligence report in the ADDX 'A' to DELHI AND EASTERN PUNJAB COMMAND Intelligence Summary No. 7 dated 28 JAN 48 corroborates the fate of Hindu women at the hands of the Azad Kashmir administration:

> "Most of the bungalows on the ASGHAR MALI RAWALPINDI have been
> allotted to the officials of the AZAD KASHMIR Government. These have
> the Hindu girls of their choice."

His guards who were according to him “composed of Pakistan ex-army men, ex-I.N.A. men, all Punjabi Muslims” committed their share atrocities which he witnessed:

> Sometimes the guards would bring with them an abducted woman from the
> Jammu area. ***They were often bought for 12 annas and 10 annas (20 to
> 40 cent) apiece. The guards would contribute a couple of annas each to

> very house where we were living at the hands of the brutal raiders.
> ***Our guards were composed of Pakistan ex-army men, ex-I.N.A. men,
> all Punjabi Muslims.***”
>
> “I saw our guards trading in women and children. ***Small children of
> ages ranging from 1 to 10 were brought from the Jammu front and were
> sold. Grown up children were misused.*** I just could not tolerate
> these things happening right in front of us.
>
> “Our guards and the old guards brought in a young woman and three or

> cried as one does on meeting lost or forlorn relations……The guards
> divided the looted property among themselves. This young girl was kept
> till the guards changed. Then they sold her to another fellow for Rs.
> 5, a high price for she was young and beautiful.”

While describing the assault on Bhimber the book “Punjab Cavalry Evolution, Role, Organisation, and Tactical Doctrine 11 Cavalry (Frontier Force) 1849-1974” mentions

> “At the break of day the civilian horde moved in, and went from house
> to house on a looting spree; Colonel Nawaz (2IC PAVO Cavalry present
> during the assault) suspects it was organised by some INA personnel.”

Nehru later wrote a telegram to his Pakistani counterpart on the 1st of December 1947

> “I have also been informed that 3,000 abducted Hindu women have been
> brought to Gujarat from the Bhimbar area and they are being sold like
> cattle at Rs.150 each.”

*Self styled “Major General” Raja Sakhi Daler Khan*

Durga Dass a Mohyal Brahmin from village Sarsawa Tehsil Kotli District Mirpur vividly describes how the self styled “Major General” Raja Sakhi Daler Khan reportedly also an INA veteran ordered the massacre of civilians in cold blood:

> “***we were brought before Sakhi Dalel in charge of the enemy who

A contemporary report in the Sainik Samachar narrates the fate of Non Muslims in Mendhar Poonch before the area’s liberation by Indian forces

The story of the sack of Mirpur as told by one of the survivors Inder Singh Bali mentions a Lt Col, one Capt and a few JCOs and men wearing black caps and the uniform of the Punjab Regt

`[It is pertinent to note that the dress of the AKRF reportedly consisted of black berets with badges of rank of Oficers/JCOs and chevrons of NCOs being made of black cloth worn on old Indian Army uniforms of World War II vintage. The Sector Commander was Col RM Arshad with Col Dilawar Khan reportedly also taking part in the assault on the town]`

> “***Out of our party about 300 girls were forcibly taken away and when
> we reached Thatala camp we heard from the Hindus that had already
> reached there that their 500 girls had also been taken away***. At
> Thatala we found that not less than 2,000 Pathans all with 303 rifles

>
> The concentration at Thatala swelled up to about 5000. Here again the
> ***Pathans sorted out young girls and carried them away***. Thatala is
> about 15 miles from Jhelum city. Among these Offrs there were one Lt

> officers and men were not wearing Regtl Signs. All these offers and
> men were wearing black caps and from their uniform I would see that
> they belonged to the Punjab Regt.”

The report of the sale of abducted girls in Jhelum is corroborated from several other sources. An extract from a report forwarded by a civil intelligence officer of the Government of India in Pakistan says:

> “In Jhelum no Hindu except our staff is left. The district liaison
> officer, who has to depend either on the information received from the
> high district officials or from some of his Muslim friends reports
> that ***in Jhelum girls abducted from Mirpur side are sold in Jhelum
> city at Rs 20/- each. The local police refuse to interfere on the
> ground that the girls were not removed from the Punjab*** and also
> they express their helplessness because of the attitude of the armed
> Pathans possessing these girls.”

Veterans of the PAVO cavalry who supported the attack on Mirpur again highlight the role of INA veterans in the sack of the city following it’s fall:

> “Again, as usual, after the PAVO Cavalry left, as the story goes,
> ***Col. Arshad (Ex-INA) arrived in Mirpur from the Mangla fort, and
> the city was looted***.”

In his work Forgotten Atrocities: Memoirs of a Survivor of the 1947 Partition of India, Bal K Gupta a witness to the sack of Mirpur describes the fate that befell the residents of the town:

> “Only twenty-five hundred people—including my uncles, Vishwa Nath,
> Mukund Lal and Suraj Parkash—out of approximately twenty-five thousand
> Hindus and Sikhs of Mirpur reached Jhangar (in India) safely with the
> retreating Jammu and Kashmir army. The ***Pakistanis ruthlessly
> kidnapped or butchered the remaining over twenty-two thousands
> residents. The number of women abducted from Mirpur ran into the
> thousands (approximately five thousand). The Pakistanis shamelessly
> paraded them and then sold them in the bazaars of Jhelum, Rawalpindi,
> and Peshawar (in Pakistan)***. The barbarities that the Pakistani
> troops and the Muslim Pathans committed upon civilians put to shame
> the worst orgies of rape and violence committed by the hordes of
> Genghis Khan, Tamerlane.”
>
> “Some Muslim villagers came armed, joined the Pakistani captors, and
> swelled their ranks. In the middle of the night, Pakistanis, Pathans,
> and local Muslims started abducting Hindu and Sikh women and young
> girls. ***I saw three women jump into a burning campfire in the Hindu
> tradition of Jauhar (or Sati) to avoid abduction and rape….”***

In the Northern Areas sector, Colonel Mata ul Mulk, having assumed command of the Skardu siege, dispatched a message to the beleaguered garrison on the 17th of June 1948, pledging their safety upon surrender drawing upon the clemency extended to non-Muslims in Chitral as an assurance of his benevolent intent:

> “THREE I therefore advise you to lay down arms and I take full
> responsibility to give protection to one and all. ***You must believe
> me and trust me as I am not only a soldier but also possess royal
> blood.*** I have given instrs to my officers and men that any one

>
> FOUR Lastly as a proof of my goodwill I wish to inform you that ***not
> a single Sikh or Hindu resident of CHITRAL has been hurt and not a
> single non-Muslim property looted or damaged and uptil now they carry
> on their business as if nothing at all had happened***”

Refusing surrender the garrison outnumbered 5 to 1 with scant hope of reinforcements continued its gallant resistance for as long as it could. However by August 90% of the garrison was sick for want of food. The Jawans themselves subsisted on barley meant for animals so that the children and women could be fed on wheat. Ammunition was down to 10 rounds a man. These dire circumstances ultimately compelled the garrison to capitulate on the 14th of August, 1948.

Col Sher Jung Thapa provides a brief description of the fall of the fort and the subsequent inhumanity he witnessed by troops under the command of the same individual who had previously offered to accept “full responsibility to give protection to one and all”:

> “On that fateful day of 14 Aug 48 the gallant survivors utterly
> exhausted and on point of starvation and out numbered enemy by 5 to l
> without ammunition, without rations and without any hope of succour
> from outside, had NO other alternative but that of capitualion. Thus
> ended the heroic seige of SKARDU which kept superior enemy at bay for
> six months and three days.
>
> Then began a period of wanton killing and cold blooded murder by the
> enemy. ***They started by indiscriminately killing the non-muslims.
> After having killed about forty they changed their tactics and killed
> all the male Sikhs, soldiers and civilian alike***. And Capt
> GANGASINGH also fell a victim to this orgy of killing. ***Though women
> were spared from these killings it was NOT from motives of chivalry.
> They were kept for the other forms of bestiality and suffered great
> humiliation and dishonour***.”

Suraj the son of the murdered Wazir-e-Wazarat Ladakh and Skardu, Mr. Amar Nath recollects the horrors that befell the prisoners following the Fall of Skardu

> “Instead of allowing us a respite from the tiredness and fear, the
> ***Pakistani Commander ordered that the prisoners should be searched
> thoroughly before being permitted to sleep. The search was actually an
> excuse to feel the pleasure of the women’s bodies*** and to confiscate
> all the gold or other valuables with them.”
>
> “I sat awake the whole night and watched with horror the ***women and
> girls being selected for the satisfaction of lust just as the
> well-developed goats are chosen for sacrifice***. Even though the
> guard was there, whenever some Chitralis or Gilgit Scouts moved
> towards our corner, which they often did due to the smallness of the
> shack, I would throw myself on their feet and humbly request not to
> harm my mother. They laughed at my antics, but, thank God, did nothing

> through the night. First, the soldiers had the decency not to rape
> women in front of the children. ***They were dragged out of the shack
> and then ravished. But with the advance of night their goodness
> evaporated : they started having the women right inside the shack and
> in front of everybody.”***
>
> “Later I was informed that the wounded P.O.Ws. left behind in the
> cantonment were the first victims of Pakistani wanton and cold blooded
> killing. As about 24 hours had lapsed after the surrender, it could be
> safely presumed that the murders of P.O.Ws. were undertaken either
> with the connivance or explicit orders of Pakistani High Command.
> However, the ***stretcher cases were brutally hauled out of beds and
> dragged over the stony path to Indus—in which river they were thrown
> alive. It was reported that the Pakistani’s efforts were aimed at
> inflicting as much pain as possible on the wounded before their death.
> To achieve this end, either the wounded was dragged by the amputated
> limb or his wound was exposed to stones. Other wounded were either
> bayoneted or shot dead. No wounded P.O.W. was left alive.*** Then the
> Pakistanis concentrated on Sikh P.O.Ws. and civilians. All the Sikh

>
> No adult male Sikh returned alive from Skardu. They were all murdered,
> often horribly. Even those boys among the Sikh community who had only
> developed a hint of moustache were not spared. They were also hacked
> to death.”

The Pakistani commander proudly passed the message to his headquarters

> “All Sikhs shot, all women raped.”

It is interesting to note that previously while in command of the Bahadur Group in the INA Burhan ud Din had a soldier namely Joga Singh flogged to death for “desertion” without a trial in violation to INA’s own laws. Burhan ud din had apparently been troubled by indiscipline within the ranks as men would go missing for days looking for women in towns. Therefore he decided to make an example out of Joga Singh and four others. A description of the incident is provided by Peter Fay:

> “On an open space in one part of the camp stood two trees about twenty
> feet apart. Between these trees at a height of nine feet a stout rope
> was stretched, and under the rope a table was placed. The detachment
> paraded. The five were brought forward. ***They had not been tried.
> They had not been told what was going to happen to them. Burhan-ud-Din
> simply announced that they had deserted.*** Therefore they would be
> flogged. Turn by turn the five were made to stand upon the table.
> Their wrists were tied to the rope. The table was pulled away. Turn by
> turn, as ordered — Burhan-ud-Din promised a beating to any who held
> back — the watching men stepped forward and struck, one blow for each
> day of the culprit s absence. Joga Singh had been gone ten days. ***He
> was strung up first and received, it was alleged, twelve hundred
> strokes from 120 men***, though at the trial the defense insisted that
> only 30 had ever paraded. ***Repeatedly he cried for mercy, and for
> water, and at times his body “contorted with pain to such an extent
> that it was bent double.” At last his cries died away. But he
> continued to hang. It was only while they were flogging the fourth man
> that they noticed he had ceased moving, and cut him down. He had been
> dead for some time.”***

The INA men were also closely involved with the Tribal Lashkars which attached themselves to AKRF units and worked in tandem and can hardly be absolved from the responsibility of what went on under their command or in adjoining outfits.

When the AKRF proved to be incapable of handling the Indian forces on its own help was offered through the induction of more tribesmen. Initially hesitant, General Kiani consented to incorporate these tribesmen into the sectors he oversaw. For better coordination with the Azad Mujahids, he favored the Sulaiman Khel Pawindahs, known for their seasonal migration to Punjab and thus conversant in Urdu. The Pir Sahib of Wana, influential among the tribe, was appointed as Kiani's primary liaison for mobilizing these lashkars. Among other actions Kiani coordinated with the tribal lashkars is the assault on Vatala, the fight in Eastern Bhimber besides equipping Kashmira Khan and his Ghilzais with firearms.

It was Sub (later Maj) Khazin Shah ex INA, who had brought a Pathan lashkar from Kohat. The Sulaiman Khel lashkars in the Jammu Sector too operated under Col. IJ Kiani on the Kathua-Jammu road.

In fact a letter to Sardar Patel by Lord Mountbatten dated 27 October 1947 describes an attack of tribesmen accompanied by a Muslim INA officer on a demobilised British officer leaving Kashmir with his wife along with another officer and his daughter via the Rawalpindi road. One of the officers was seriously wounded before the Ex INA officer intervened as saved their lives

It is unfortunate that the same courtesy could not be extended to thousands of Hindus and Sikhs throughout the entirety of the state. The report by a Hindu Convert to Islam who served in the Azad Kashmir Government narrates the following:

There exists today a highly romanticized and virtually untouchable image of the Indian National Army (INA) and its members in contemporary India, where they are often depicted as infallible patriots utterly devoted to the nation's liberation. The INA, under the command of Subhas Chandra Bose, is celebrated as an ultra-secular entity, as evidenced by the statement from Shah Nawaz Khan, who noted,

> "In the INA there was no “communal" feeling of any sort inspite of the
> fact that every men had full liberty to practise his religion in any
> way he liked. He (Bose) made his soldiers realise that they were the
> sons of the same motherland, and, as such, there could be no
> differences between them. We were all completely united and it was
> realised by us that the communal differences in our country were the
> creation of an alien power. The success of this can be gauged from the
> fact that the most ardent supporters and admirers of Netaji were to be
> found among Muslims"

Khan then proceeds to list four of Bose's fervent Muslim supporters (including himself) two of whom later assumed significant leadership roles in Pakistan and were instrumental in the invasion of Kashmir. Ironically, an intelligence report reveals that Shah Nawaz Khan himself allegedly penned a letter to the "Zamindar," a daily newspaper in Lahore in December 1947

> "***expressing his sympathies for Pakistan and also for Kashmir
> raiders.***" When confronted about this letter, he reportedly stated,
> "***As a Muslim, he stood for a Muslim's right of self-determination
> everywhere in Kashmir as well as in India.*** As a Muslim, he could
> not be against Pakistan."

Despite these complexities, contemporary narratives often paint the INA with an overly idealistic brush, citing, for instance, the Rani Jhansi regiment as a model for women in combat. However, this regiment's soldiers never engaged in actual combat, struggled with basics skills like Map reading, and were more involved in producing propaganda imagery while their male counterparts faced horrors such as being consumed by maggots, strafed by British aircraft, starved, or bayoneted by their Japanese “allies”. Furthermore, the INA's claim by some of its veterans to have never lost an engagement is so patently absurd that it warrants no serious historical consideration.

It is indeed paradoxical that contemporary profiteers, who capitalise on the legacy of Subhas Chandra Bose through books and articles, simultaneously brand the British Indian Army as a mercenary force while absolving INA veterans involved in the Kashmir conflict from charges of religious fanaticism. They argue that these veterans were compelled to align with Pakistan due to their exclusion from the Indian military, asserting that as citizens of a new nation, they were duty-bound to follow their government's directives—a stance that is both laughable and contradictory.

In May 1946, the CSDIC (India) compiled 'a brief chronological and factual account of the INA', which addressed the issue of communalism within the INA showcasing Bose's strategy of appointing Muslims to high positions was aimed at

> "dispelling the fear from the minds of the Muslims that the INA was a
> purely Hindu inspired organisation."

This raises questions about what purpose did this deliberate inclusion of Muslims in high ranking posts in the INA serve besides inadvertently providing Pakistan with the ideal cadre ready for the Kashmir invasion?

Regardless Militarily the INA proved itself to be a failure due to inadequate support and logistical challenges in face of the might of the British Indian army. Attempts at enforced secularism, such as the mixing of Jhatka and Halal meat rations in one regiment for general consumption were met with resistance from both Hindu/Sikh and Muslim soldiers, leading to minor communal skirmishes and the dismissal of officers like Capt. Rahman and Dhana Singh.

Desertions within the INA while mostly based on logistical despair also reflected religious affiliations and extra territorial loyalties as causes. Capt. P.K. Sahgal in his “SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING DESERTIONS” notes

> "Turkey’s alignment alongside the anti-axis powers has had a very
> adverse effect on certain Muslim Officers. Inspite of our efforts to
> explain to them the circumstances under which Turkey has been forced
> to join the War, the ***officers feel that by fighting against powers
> that are allied with the Turks, they are being disloyal to Islam***."

Several Muslim officers, including Shahnawaz Khan, Capt. Dilawar Khan, Lt. Shafullah, Capt. T.M. Khanzada, and Capt. A.I.S. Dara, were part of a faction within the first INA that aimed at its dissolution. This 'Block' had objectives "To help Punjabi Mussalmans who were to remain out as a body, while a few of us were to join the INA 'to gain control of its policy”and “To wreck the I.N.A. when and if we had an opportunity of doing so

These individuals later claimed a transformation in allegiance under Netaji's leadership, yet their subsequent roles in the Kashmir conflict suggest a continuity of religious motives rather than a commitment to a secular, united India. MZ Kiani the future C-in-C of AKRF write in his memoirs:

> "Little did I then realize, that in time to come, in a revolutionary
> movement ... I would be one of the strongest advocates of
> inter-communal unity and harmony for the purpose of fighting against
> the foreign rule of our country."

Leading a full fledged invasion which saw his forces (mind you he himself was accused) of abducting and violating non-Muslim women and massacring the male population in cold blood seems an odd way of being “one of the strongest advocates of inter-communal unity and harmony” a policy he claims to have followed while in the INA.

It is thus that this “transition” from undermining the INA on religious grounds to ostensibly supporting Indian religious unity and freedom only to revert to participating in horrendous crimes against non Muslims in their jihadistic endeavours in Jammu and Kashmir, poses profound questions about what were their true intentions in the first place.

`NOTE: The author often uses the nomenclature of “Azad” Kashmir while referring to PoK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) and its illegitimate government or the AKRF (Azad Kashmir Regular Forces). The reasons for doing so our purely academic and he in no way supports or recognises it as independent entity but an indisputable part of India.`

`The author also acknowledges the significant sacrifices made by dedicated members of the INA, such as Colonel P.S. Raturi, who, after leading spectacular actions in Kaladan, went on to serve the Indian government, ultimately retiring as Principal Director in the Directorate General of Security, a co-agency of the Research and Analysis Wing. Similarly, figures like Colonel L.S. Misra, Mansukh Lal and countless others who courageously gave his life for the cause of freedom are deserving of greater recognition. At the same time it is important to critically examine and question the true nature and beliefs of many members of the organisation so as to take lessons from history as opposed to indulging in mindless hero worship.`

I would lastly like to thank my Mentor who I only know by the name of Berserker Lancelot for equipping me with the necessary knowledge and resources to give shape to the article and bring out uncomfortable truths
