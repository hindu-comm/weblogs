The uprising of 1857 encompasses a myriad of captivating vignettes in history, spanning from the participation of female ghazis hailing from Rampur in the siege of Delhi to the presence of a Nepalese Brahmin and spymaster among Nana Sahib Peshwa's advisors; and the intriguing inclusion of Abdullah Beg and Sergeant Major Gordon, British defectors who embraced Islam in the rebel forces in Delhi.

The revolt which has been termed (quite incorrectly so) as the “First war of Indian independence” was ignited by rumours surrounding the cartridges of the newly instituted Enfield rifles which were alleged to be greased with a mixture containing fats derived from pigs and cows. This rumour, though partially accurate, finds validation in the testimony of Captain Boxer, who served as the superintendent of the Laboratory Department at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. He attested that the lubricating substances indeed incorporated cow fat!!

Among the intriguing narratives that emerge from the canvas of the revolt, one that particularly captivates attention is the presence of African snipers within the ranks of the rebel forces during the prolonged siege of Lucknow. These sharpshooters instilled a sense of dread within the British forces through their accurate aim, earning a collection of monikers from the besieged English troops, including appellations like "Bob the Nailer" and "Jim the Rifleman."

*African eunuch (3rd from left) and African queen Yasmin (2nd from right) at the court of Wajid Ali Shah.*

The former “Bob the Nailer” was believed to be a eunuch formerly employed in the harem of the Nawab of Awadh. Equipped with a first-rate double barrelled rifle, he would reportedly lie for hours waiting to inflict casualties on unsuspecting British troops from his vantage point in “Johannes’ house” during the siege of Lucknow with his deadly aim. Some accounts go so far as to suggest that he used actual “nails” for ammunition!!

The house offered a perfect view of the Cawnpore batteries, Brigade Mess and La Martinere post which was fully exploited by the rebels with “Nailer” himself taking position in one of the turrets outside the house which led to the roof of the buildings.

</div>

*The Cawnpore Battery*

From this advantageous position, he wreaked havoc among British ranks, with rebel fire inflicting several casualties among the men in the Cawnpore battery. Such was the skill of “the nailer” that his shots demonstrated an uncanny ability to breach even doors and windows of a grand banquet hall which had been repurposed into a General hospital by the besieged English forces. With his fire reaching the very beds of the wounded and men dying in the centre of the room, the occupants in desperation endeavoured to secure the northern side by employing a makeshift fortifications composed of tents and crates laden with earth. But their efforts proved futile for individuals continued falling victim to sniper fire within the confines of this edifice throughout the duration of the siege.

*The Banqueting Hall within the Residency compound originally also served as a council chamber. During the siege that accompanied the 1857 Indian uprising, it was used as a hospital. Dodgson remarked: "The rebels were well aware of this and made it an especial mark for their shot; several wounded soldiers had their earthly career terminated by round shot of shell, while lying in their cots." The Indians only spared the rooms north of the hospital area where state prisoners such as the Nawab's brother and two Mughal princes were lodged.*

The African marksman made it impossible for any man attempting to get across the road to draw water from a well present there to escape his unfailing aim. Traversing the road was a feat achievable solely during the intervals in which he reloaded his double barreled rifle, with any other attempts resulting in certain deaths.

A veteran of the siege recalled

> “when any one of our men ventured across the road he (“Bob the
> Nailer”) would drop him by a rifle ball. Bob was a sure marksman. The
> only way to get across the road for water from the well was to wait
> until his gun flashed and then instantly cross, before he had time to
> load.”

Attempts to eliminate him using gunfire proved unfruitful due to the protection afforded to him by the turret. In order to silence the enemy position, a British detachment composed of 50 Europeans and 20 Sikhs led by Captain Mansfield and engineers led by Captain Fulton and Lieutenant Anderson launched a sortie on the 7th of July 1857. While the detachment succeeded in surprising the rebel troops and inflicted twenty casualties on them, they failed to find and eliminate Bob the Nailer who had made his escape.

Ultimately, a decision was made to demolish the house itself using a mine (containing 400 lbs of gunpowder) which was dug from the Martiniere Post with the fatal marksman, Bob the Nailer, meeting his demise in the resulting blast.

The other sniper, also said to be an African eunuch formerly in the service of the Nawab, picked off British troops from his position on a gateway on which he was perched (termed as the “clock tower” due to the face of a clock being painted on it). His skill equaled that of “the nailer” with his shots dealing death on almost every occasion.

*The ruins of the Clock Tower Gate and Mosque in the aftermath of the Siege of Lucknow*

The toll of skilled soldiers lost to his rifle and his relentless gunfire prompted the British soldiers to deploy a Howitzer commanded by Captain Thomas of the Madras artillery against his shelter, all with the aim of eliminating a singular adversary!!!

Despite the position being shelled with great persistence and remarkable accuracy and detonating precisely on target, it failed to silence the sniper. The wily assailant equipped with a telescope evaded elimination by anticipating the shelling and using a ladder simply dropped down into a fortified cavern he had prepared. As the shells erupted harmlessly overhead, he would resurface, rifle in hand, and reaffirm his audacity through the subsequent piercing trajectory of his bullets.

He was ultimately killed when the British launched an assault to seize the Gateway, with the enigma of his elusive tactics being solved when they found a telescope and a rifle by his side.

The African snipers left a lasting impact on the British forces, a fact evident from the accounts provided by the veterans of the siege of Lucknow.

**LER Rees** testifies to the deadliness of the sharpshooter in his memoirs

> “...A few well-aimed shots from the rifles of the late king’s African
> eunuchs and other first-rate sharpshooters, often deprived us of
> three, four, and even more stout English hearts. We were then more
> careless of walking about the premises, and were picked off in the
> midst of the most peaceful occupations. One poor soldier, I remember,
> who was standing talking with me, every now and then giving a few
> puffs of guava-leaf smoke from his self-manufactured wooden pipe,
> suddenly fell dead at my feet. A rifle bullet had pierced his
> temples.”

He further states

> “Our deaths were very numerous up to this day. They averaged about

**William Forbes Mitchell’s** ‘Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny, 1857-59’ showcases the lethality of the African snipers

> “During the early part of the forenoon we had several men struck by
> rifle bullets fired from one of the minarets in the Motee Mahal, which

> the Shah Nujeef. We soon had several men wounded, and as there was no
> surgeon with us”

Forbes also documented the remarkable presence of a female marksman. He recounts a fierce encounter between British forces and rebels, during which the soldiers, driven by unrelenting thirst, were enticed by the cool shade of a peepal tree whose base held jars brimming with water. A number of these from the Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third regiments, however, were soon found to be lying lifeless beneath the very tree. This caught Captain Dawson's observant eye, who upon meticulous inspection of the wounds, he discerned a recurring trait – each soldier had unmistakably fallen victim to shots fired from an elevated position.

Dawson promptly retraced his steps from beneath the tree and summoned a soldier to look for enemy presence at the tree's crown. The soldier, seeing movement in the uppermost branches, cocked his rifle and squeezed the trigger. In response, a woman clad in a scarlet jacket and rose-hued silk trousers tumbled down. Armed with a pair of cavalry pistols at her side and a pouch half-full of reserve ammunition, she had prepared her position meticulously before the battle with her fire claiming more than a dozen victims.

The presence of African snipers in rebel ranks or the female marksman from Lucknow, an Indian version of Lady death are one of the several mesmerising tapestries of astonishing chronicles unveiled in the revolt of 1857. Their ingenious strategies, elusive tactics and unmatched accuracy wove a fabric of dread that permeated the British ranks. Known only through the nicknames such as "Bob the Nailer" and "Jim the Rifleman," given to them by their foes, they played a vital role within a battle far removed from their places of origin.
