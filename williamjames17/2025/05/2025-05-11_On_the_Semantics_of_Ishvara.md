***The Problem***

Hinduism is, dare I say it, the only major world religion to have its status *as a major world religion* so relentlessly interrogated as to be cast into doubt altogether. Some suggest that the very idea of a coherent religious structure known as ‘Hinduism’ is an unacceptable reification; a plethora of traditions shunted together by European scholars under a singular, vacuous term. Others say that it is *now* a coherent religion, the product of a deliberate act of strategic essentialism amongst ‘indigenous’ Indian traditions in the nineteenth to twentieth centuries to produce a consolidated Indian identity that could serve the ambitions of Indian anticolonialists, and, later, Hindutvavādins. Others still would say that it is *indeed* a religion, suggestions to the contrary tacitly assuming an Abrahamic or ‘monotheistic’ definition of what constitutes a religion in the first place. While debates surrounding the status of other traditions, such as Confucianism, are certainly documented, few, if any, have generated such a vast motley of perspectives. None have so much; politically, socially, or culturally, riding on them. What gives? What could possibly cause all this?

The most fundamental, and seemingly indissoluble, issue with asserting Hinduism as a coherent religious identity, is that of *Īśvara*. While that term has been translated into English in a variety of ways; as God, the Lord, the Supreme Being, etc., none of these are directly relevant to the issue at hand. For our purposes, we can define Īśvara as that entity which is *bhajanīya-guṇa-viśiṣṭa*; that is, that entity which is the exemplar instance of the predicate ‘worshipable’. That entity, then, which is the worshipable *as such*, and that all other worshipable entities must participate in, in order to possess that status. The problem here becomes quite obvious: different Hindu traditions, and even different Hindu scriptures, assign this status to different entities. Not only do they ascribe this status to different entities, but they also subordinate other entities identified in other scriptures as Īśvara and question the ultimate epistemic worth of those other scriptures. For example, in the famous Mokṣadharma-parva of the Mahābhārata (12.337.58-68**)**, the sage Vaiśaṁpāyana says as follows:

> *“The Sāṅkhya, the Yoga, the Pāñcarātra, the Veda and the Pāśupata: O
> kingly sage, you are to understand these as being the various
> doctrinal systems. The propounder of the Sāṅkhya system was Kapila,
> who was said to be the greatest of all sages. Only Brahmā amongst the
> ancient beings knows the Yoga system. The sage Apāntaratamā (Vyāsa)
> was known to be the expounder of the Veda; others may know him by the
> name of Prācīnagarbha. The Husband of Umā, the Lord of beings, the Son
> of Brahmā, the Even-minded Śiva; He was the propounder of the Pāśupata
> system. The Lord Himself, however, was the expounder of the Pāñcarātra
> system and is, O great king, observed to be present in all these
> doctrinal systems. As per the scriptures and these systems, Nārāyaṇa
> is established to be the Lord. O great ruler, those beings that are
> veiled by spiritual darkness do not understand this, whereas the truly
> wise are those that proclaim Nārāyaṇa to be both the creator and
> ultimate end of all doctrinal systems and that there is no other end.
> Hari verily dwells within the hearts of those who are certain on this
> matter. He does not abide in the hearts of those who are doubtful or
> use only dry logic to ascertain the matter. O ruler, those who know
> the Pāñcarātra system and abide by its ritual praxis, having become
> dedicated in their practice, certainly attain Hari. O king, the
> Sāṅkhya and Yoga systems, as well as the whole of the Veda, declare
> without doubt that Nārāyaṇa, who is expounded upon by the sages, is
> within all things.” (trans. Ganguli, mod.)*

These verses are hardly beating around the bush: Nārāyaṇa is Īśvara, and His system, the Pañcarātra, alone propounds the ultimate truth. All others are mere provisional truths for those on the way towards realising the Pañcarātra. That said, of course, other Hindu scriptures disagree. In the Mṛgendrāgama Vidyāpāda (2.10-11), in an exchange between the sage Bharadvāja and Śiva, a markedly different account is given:

> *‘Bharadvāja said:*
>
> *“The nature of liberation, the means of attaining it, and the natures
> of existence and nonexistence have already been set forth variously in
> the Vedānta, the Sāṅkhya, and in other doctrinal systems. So, what is
> the specific need for Your doctrine?”*
>
> *Śiva replied:*
>
> *“The propounders of those doctrinal systems were not omniscient, and,
> as a consequence, they did not grasp the entirety of reality.
> Therefore, the nature of liberation, as well as the means of attaining
> it, have not been accurately and definitively set forth by them.
> Because this doctrinal system is being propounded by Me specifically,
> it stands exalted above all others.”’ (trans. Sabharatanam, mod.)*

Here, it is the Śaiva system that is exalted above all others; to resort to any other system for liberation is, as the āgama later states, “as futile as trying to get fire from a firefly.” This is, obviously, completely at odds with Vaiśaṁpāyana’s statement in the Mahābhārata; the Pāñcarātra and Śaiva systems cannot be equated with one another in any intelligible way. They differ not only in which deity they propound as supreme but also in broader metaphysical commitments, ritual praxis and hermeneutical standards. Worse yet, statements like these are hardly rare in the Hindu scriptural corpus; there are innumerable declarations of supremacy for a multitude of different deities and doctrines, all with alternative accounts of how the others relate to them. Needless to say, this hardly looks like a single, coherent religion by any stretch of that word.

So, then, what strategies might one who is committed to the intelligibility of Hinduism’s identity as a coherent religious structure be able to avail themselves of to defend their position? One would be that the relevant texts are *mohaśāstras*, that is, texts that deliberately mislead their audience away from truths they are not eligible to receive. This, in and of itself, is not without precedent in the Hindu scriptural corpus, as, in the Padma Purāṇa (6.71.107-109) Viṣṇu states the following to Śiva:

> *“Being born in the Dvāpara and Kali yugas renders people averse to
> Me, due to the texts that will be propounded by You. In those texts,
> You must censure Me so that the continuance of the world is
> guarranteed. I shall produce this delusion to envelop the peoples of
> the world. You, O mighty-armed Rudra, ought to produce these texts,
> that they may delude people. O You of great arms, produce texts that
> are of doubtful legitimacy; unveil Yourself, and in so doing, keep Me
> veiled.” (trans. Deshpande, mod.)*

That said, if one chooses to pursue this avenue, the difficulties one will face will be indissoluble— sectarian inclinations are *utterly ubiquitous* in the Hindu scriptural corpus. *If you reject them all, there will simply be nothing left*. Due to this, anyone who wishes to intelligibly utilise the mohaśāstra argument must only reject a specific array of sectarian literature, one already explicitly classified as mohaśāstra. The pitfall here, however, is that any classification of a certain Hindu scriptural subcorpus as mohaśāstra is a classification *according to a different sect’s criteria*. This is tantamount to an acceptance of *that* sect’s ultimate validity, which results in other Hindu sects only being intelligibly ‘Hindu’ insofar as they participate within that sect’s hierarchical characterisation of itself and its rivals. While this is accurate according to a perspective *internal* to that sect; as an account of the coherence of Hinduism *tout court*, it is inadmissible. This is the case because, in the act of hierarchically characterising other sects vis-a-vis one’s own, the very fact that those sects can intelligibly participate in ‘Hinduism’ while other traditions can not, indicates that there are necessary conditions required for ‘Hindu-ness’ to obtain, conditions invariant between any sectarian hierarchisation supervening on it. It is for this reason that sectarian verses or texts cannot either be dismissed as *arthavāda*; that is, mere hyperbole intended to bolster devotees’ faith in their chosen deity. This is all but equivalent to the sectarian perspective of the Smārta tradition, and thus, one who avails himself of it as a way of explaining the consistency of Hinduism *tout court* ends up falling into the same trap.

Given the failure of these prospective solutions, a new account of the coherence of Hindu identity is in order. One notable attempt at supplying this account in recent years is found in Butler (2017), wherein the concept of *polycentricity* is employed to make sense of the variety of sectarian positions on view in Hinduism. This concept, derived mainly from the works of the renowned Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus, equates the One, usually considered a reified ‘absolute principle’ in popular discourse on Neoplatonism, with the *very principle of individuation* for the Henads; that is, the set of superessential ‘entities’ that contain within each the entirety of the whole, each individually constituting the ground of being. Butler, by equating the position of Īśvara with that of Henad, attempts to articulate how various sectarian imputations of īśvaratva (that is, the position of Īśvara) onto certain deities, and the subordination of others can be understood as occurring within an internally coherent system:

> *“The Gods who are the objects of bhakti are supreme for their
> devotees, in the way that polytheism has always functioned. When one
> of these is at the center, the others are on the periphery: hence,
> within the tradition of Kṛṣṇa bhakti, Śiva subordinates himself, while
> in Śiva’s own bhakti traditions, Viṣṇu, of whom Kṛṣṇa is the avatar or
> emanation, is seen as created by Śiva. This is not to be understood
> merely as cults in ‘competition.’ The multiplicity of īśvaras, of Gods
> who are the objects of singular devotion, is neither an accident, nor
> the mask of a simple underlying unity. For to conclude this is would
> be to demote the actual objects of this devotion, and therefore do the
> most basic violence to the experience we are purportedly trying to
> understand.”[1](https://williamjames17.substack.com/p/on-the-semantics-of-isvara#footnote-1-145650066)*

Despite Butler’s averral that monocentric articulations of Hinduism “do the most basic violence to the experience(s)*”* that motivate the recognition of īśvaratva in a specific deity, there is an important, if deceptively simple, reason why Butler’s account runs a potential risk of doing a similar violence to those experiences: that the very position of the multiplicity of īśvaras, or *bahu-īśvara-vāda*, is emphatically condemned by a majority of Hindu traditions. On the face of it, there is a simple rejoinder to be offered here: these condemnations are to be entirely expected on a polycentric account, as each tradition is simply articulating its own devotional perspective vis-a-vis their ‘īśvara’*,* within which it is indeed unintelligible that other deities would share that status. However, this reply ignores several fundamental facts about how sects recognise īśvaratva and hierarchically relate themselves to their rivals. There is a direct relation between the *unilaterality* of each system’s hierarchical characterisation of itself and its rivals and the implicit substructure of Hinduism itself. As I stated earlier, when a certain sect hierarchically characterises its rivals relative to itself, from their perspective, participation in Hinduism *tout court* becomes a property that other doctrinal systems possess insofar as they participate in *its* hierarchical classification. However, the fact that some traditions *do* participate, while others, such as Jainism or Buddhism, do not, indicates that there are indeed certain indispensable *sine qua nons* for participating in Hinduism, conditions other rival sects can satisfy without sharing explicit hierarchical classifications. Most sects consider themselves superior insofar as they *illustrate* what is already implicit within the hierarchical classifications of other sects. To see this in action, take as an example Vaiśaṁpāyana’s previously cited statements in the Mahābhārata, wherein the Pāñcarātrika system is exalted:

> *“…The Lord Himself, however, was the expounder of the Pāñcarātra
> system and is, O great king, observed to be present in all these
> doctrinal systems. As per the scriptures and these systems, Nārāyaṇa
> is established to be the Lord. O great ruler, those beings that are
> veiled by spiritual darkness do not understand this, whereas the truly
> wise are those that proclaim Nārāyaṇa to be both the creator and
> ultimate end of all doctrinal systems and that there is no other
> end…”*

Here the Īśvara of the Pāñcarātra, known under the name of Nārāyaṇa, is explicitly identified as the sole object of *all* doctrinal systems. The Pāñcarātra is distinct because it unsurpassably exemplifies and illustrates this fact. Naturally, to avoid collapsing the significant differences between the various doctrinal systems comprising Hinduism, one might be tempted to resort to a polycentric explanation for such language choices. However, doing so would indeed do the most fundamental violence imaginable to the way in which Nārāyaṇa is uniquely and singularly exalted here. If the substructure of Hinduism is an essentially polycentric multiplicity, then any monocentric articulation of that structure *cannot* possess any epistemic ultimacy it attributes to itself. For Vaiśaṁpāyana to posit Nārāyaṇa as the sole end of all doctrinal traditions becomes a vacuous flourish; a concession to blinkered minds unable to comprehend the polycentric manifold, unable to accept that the statement would just as well apply to any other deity.

So, what is left? A quasi-Abrahamic monotheism? A homogenised gruel wherein the distinctiveness of spiritual experiences is entirely superfluous? Not at all. There, is, I think, an ingenious logic at work here in how the term ‘Īśvara’ functions; a logic that I believe to be essential to understanding the underlying substructure of the Hindu religion.

***A Solution?***

Having spent quite a while attempting to parse some sort of solution to these problems, I concluded that this issue in general is one in which dialogue with Western analytic philosophy would be particularly fruitful. At the very least, I thought, being able to clarify and condense the language underlying these difficulties and pinpointing where they arose would be indispensable for any real progress to be made going forward. However, during the course of my research, I came across a specific position on the semantics of belief reports, primarily championed by the philosophers Scott Soames and Nathan Salmon, that, when applied to talk about Īśvara, almost entirely dissolves the difficulties associated with the term and its scope

This position, dubbed the ‘Radical View’ on belief reports by Stefano Predelli[2](https://williamjames17.substack.com/p/on-the-semantics-of-isvara#footnote-2-145650066), is best understood via an analogy: it is commonly believed that if Lois Lane believes that *Superman* can fly, that doesn’t automatically follow that she believes *Clark Kent* can fly. According to Soames and Salmon, however, this assumption is based on a fundamental error. According to them, beliefs arise from a three-part cognitive relation called BEL: the believer, the content of the belief, and their representation of that content. If a believer holds a specific belief about its content in the context of a specific representation of that content, it does not follow that they no longer hold the belief if they are unable to assent to a statement that is equivalent to their belief, but in the context of a different representation of that content. The mistake we intuitively make when we think that Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly but not Clark Kent is that we assume there are two different beliefs here: one, that Superman can fly, and another, that Clark cannot. For Scott and Soames, Lois Lane has only one belief: that Superman/Clark can fly. However, she is only *BEL-related* to that belief under the *Superman* representation of Superman/Clark. A representation that does not include the additional contextual information that Superman and Clark Kent are the same person. Thus, with regards to the belief *qua* itself, the terms Superman and Clark can indeed be substituted with one another without changing the truth of the statement about Lois Lane’s beliefs. She *does believe* that Clark Kent can fly, she just doesn't *know* that she does yet.

To make this approach more intuitively understandable, we need to the sense in which 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' differ despite being semantically substitutable. Specifically, we need to understand the sense in which it would be inappropriate to refer to 'Clark Kent' when discussing Lois Lane's belief that Superman can fly. We can do this by noting that, in the initial statement “Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly,” the presence of the subject (Lois), along with the relation of believing, implies the third term of the BEL relation: a specific representation of Superman such that Lois Lane can intelligibly assent to the statement that he can fly. In this context, the statement “Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent can fly,” becomes misleading and inappropriate for describing Lois Lane’s cognitive state, as Lois Lane only believes that Superman/Clark can fly under Superman-representations.

Translating the analogy over to Īśvara-talk, I think, results in a remarkably intuitive way of accounting for how the term functions. Within the Hindu milieu, the various doctrinal systems make different provisional hypotheses as to which entity is equivalent to Īśvara. Thus, for example, though Vaiṣṇavas are BEL-related to Īśvara under an Īśvara-representation, it does not then follow that they could intelligibly assent to propositions concerning Īśvara under a Śiva-representation, even if, for Śaivas, the Īśvara-representation is nothing more than a specific characterisation of Śiva himself; that characterisation then being imputed onto Nārāyaṇa. It is also through this that statements like that of Vaiśaṁpāyana’s in the Mahabharata ought to be understood from a pan-Hindu perspective: as the Vaiṣṇava tradition proposes a provisional identification between Nārāyaṇa and Īśvara, it is to be understood that the former is the ultimate object of all doctrinal systems *qua* his identification with Īśvara.

In the context of Īśvara, the primary difference between doctrinal systems is not simply which terms they consider semantically substitutable with ‘Īśvara’. Instead, it is about which terms are *pragmatically appropriate* in the context of Īśvara-talk due to the absence of *referential ambiguity*. This ambiguity arises because the terms used to designate specific entities as Īśvara originate from Īśvara Himself. Since these terms derive from a common source, they are coreferential and, technically, thus substitutable. However, when these terms are provisionally applied to other entities, a level of ambiguity is introduced as to their intended referent. This ambiguity undermines the relevance of those terms in discursive contexts where Īśvara is being discussed *as* Īśvara (that is, in the context of Īśvara-representations *qua* themselves).

Consequently, terms that are not attributed to different entities—those that specifically designate the entity identified as Īśvara in a given doctrinal system—are more suitable in such contexts. This is an invariant property of Īśvara-representations across the doctrinal systems that use them. For instance, the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava ācārya Jīva Gosvāmī, in his Bhakti Sandarbha, cites a (now untraceable) verse from the Brahmā Purāṇa to illustrate this point:

> “*Brahmā has names such as ‘Caturmukha’, ‘Śatānanda’,and ‘Padmabhū’,
> while Śiva has names such as ‘Ugra’, ‘Bhasmadhara’, ‘Nagna’, and
> ‘Kapālī.’ In this way, Keśava gave them some of His own specific
> names.*" *(trans. Bhanu Swami, mod.)*

Similarly, from a Śaiva perspective, Śiva Purāṇa (7.1.32.23) lists ‘Viṣṇu’ and ‘Pitāmaha (Brahmā)’ as names of Śiva alongside other common names of Him such as ‘Maheśvara’ and ‘Rudra.’ Outside of these specific applications, this principle can be seen in the Veda itself, in the Aitareyopaniṣad (3.14):

> *“The Lord is known as Idandra, the All-Seeing One. Though He is known
> as Idandra, He is indirectly referred to as ‘Indra’, for the gods are
> fond of indirectness; verily, the gods are fond of indirectness.”
> (translation my own)*

This *śruti*, with its focus on the concept of indirectness, or *parokṣatvam*, delves into the crux of *why* referential ambiguity arises: due to their limited epistemic faculties, humans cannot adequately distinguish between the original referent of an imputed term (Īśvara Himself) and the imputed referent (the deva it has been imputed onto). They may perceive imputed referents for non-imputed terms that do designate Īśvara but not specifically under an Īśvara-representation. This does not necessarily mean their beliefs are false: if they collapse the distinction between Īśvara Himself and an imputed referent for a specific term, it reflects the truth that, in that context, both referents are indistinguishable. Conversely, if they distinguish Īśvara from another term and mistakenly identify an imputed referent for it, it indicates that the term does not specifically index an Īśvara-representation in the same way that ‘Īśvara’ itself does. This applies, not only to a specific range of names, but to all the names of the devas; all of which are imputed terms designating their offices, which are themselves partial imputations of Īśvara’s nature, insofar as which they participate in that distinguishing quality of īśvaratva; worshipability. Hence, the famous verse from the Ṛg Veda (1.164.46):

> *“(He has been called) Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, and the divine,
> well-winged Garutman. For though He is one, the vipras know Him by
> many names, such as Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan.” (trans. Wilson,
> mod.)*

To finish off: what, of course, should be noted is that I haven’t identified *who* Īśvara is; all I have done, I hope, is prove that there *is* an Īśvara, that He (or She!) is uniquely singular, and that this singularity reflects in how imputations of īśvaratva are handled and employed by various doctrinal systems. This, I submit, is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition for what ‘unifies’ Hinduism. It is an element of its underlying substructure, one hidden within the various sectarian characterisations of Hinduism. Of course, where one chooses to distinguish between Īśvara and a deva playing the role of imputed referent or not depends upon which doctrinal system one adheres to. And *that* is another can of worms entirely.
