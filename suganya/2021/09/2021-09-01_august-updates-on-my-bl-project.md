[BL-EAP] August updates on my BL project

It’s been a month since we started, and bon gré, mal gré, [my BL project](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/08/02/bl-eap-beginning-work-on-a-british-library-endangered-archives-programme-project/) has begun to bear results already, as we got the BL’s approval for the quality of our digital images and for the catalogue entries, so that we can go ahead now. We have also found some very nice manuscripts, and sometimes with interesting colophons.

At least two of the MSS from the Villiampākkam collection belong to a certain Kuppucāmi from Viḻuppuram, a town located not far away from Pondicherry (see below):

Another one (a MS on *Amāvāsya tarpaṇam*) contains a nice drawing of the Śrīvaiṣṇava signs (tirumaṇ, conch and discuss) incised on it. And it really is a MS that required our immediate attention, as you can see yourself:

Not sure how much longer these leaves would have lasted…

From a gorgeous *pādukāsahasram* MS, we also got a nice date from a conscientious scribe: the 6th of June, 1842.

> dinaḥ pādukāsahasragrantham atra 17 varṣaṃ śubhakṛtanāma saṃvat\[9\]saram uttarāyana māna(?) vaiśākhamāsam kṛṣṇapakṣe trayoḍaśi induvāsaram ākiya 26 teeti yi (?) bharaṇinakṣatram śubhayogaśubhakaraṇatir sāyaṃkālaṃ

We have to thank Akane for finding this, and also the following colophon (and I know, we need to clean up the transcription, but we’ll do that later):

> ādivaṇśaṭhakopayatīndramahādeśikebhyo namaḥ/ —– śrīmatbhya > śrīnivāsayatīndramahādeśikobhyo namaḥ/ —– raṅganāthayatīndramahādeśikebhyo namaḥ/ śrīmatbhyaḥ raṃgaṇāthaśaṭhakopayatīndramahādeśikebhyonamaḥ/ śrīmatbhyo veṃkaṭanārāyaṇamahādeśikebhyo namaḥ/

Now, this colophon above points straight at a link with the Ahobila Maṭha, which always makes me happy for personal reasons. To think that someone who lived close to Kalliṭaikkuṟicci in the deep South should have links with this Maṭha is a wonderful thing. And with a bit of detective work, we should be able to roughly date this MS precisely based on the names of these *maṭḥādhipati*s.

Another MS which contains some of both Rāmānujācārya’s and Vedānta Deśika’s works, also has as its invocation verses on Narasiṃha that are typically recited by the followers of this *Maṭha*. We still need to find more colophons in which the scribe of this Kalliṭaikkuṟicci collection reveals more about himself. I’m really curious to know more about him and his family, and in case he was working for someone else, then about that family too!

A different light setup to improve the quality of the images

Anyway, work is progressing nicely, although the beginning had more than its fair share of bumps, with one of the digitising staff backing off at the end of the very first week, as she was terrorised by the precision with which the photos of the manuscripts needed to be taken. Ramesh came to replace her, and has been doing a great job so far, along with his colleague Venkatarajan. And much of the credit goes to Ramesh Kumar, a professional photographer who has much experience working with other BL projects. He painstakingly trained them, and still guides them when challenges arise.

The next little challenge was that the cataloguer couldn’t handle the job; he struggled with data entry, and then had to work from home, and still, it didn’t quite work out as hoped. So we needed to replace him. So we asked scholars affiliated with the EFEO to help out. So in came Akane (for the Sanskrit MSS) and Saravanan (for the Tamil ones) to help us out of a difficult situation. Lifesavers, they are!

As the lemongrass oil used for cleaning the MSS is rather strong, the cleaning person has been getting headaches. So to avoid any one person from being too exposed to this oil for too long, we have trained the photographers to clean and oil the MSS, and will also soon teach Murugesan to take photos according to the BL standards. The hope is to have them take turns, so that none of them suffers too much, and so that they are all trained in everything. So we are making mistakes and learning from them as well!
