[Book Review] Hayagrīvam upāsmahe. A Homage to Swāmi Vedānta Deśika

In July ’21, I attended the release function of this book organised by the publishers, [Sri Vishnu Mohan Foundation](http://svmf.in/home.html), Chennai. It was a hybrid event, the full lockdown having just been lifted then. This volume is a conference proceeding which was held during Vedānta Deśika’s (traditional dates: 1268-1369) 750th anniversary, which contains contributions by 14 scholars, both traditional and academic, and which was edited by C.T. Indra et al. And the cover features a sketch of Hayagrīva, a personal favourite of Deśika’s. This is a VERY INFORMAL review of this book

This volume, which is divided into two sections (“Philosophy” and “Religion”), contains articles on Deśika from different perspectives, and is precious for many reasons, the foremost perhaps being that it contains contributions (possibly their last ones) by two great scholars who left us recently, namely, the late Dr M. A. Lakshmithathachar and the late Dr Mannargudi Rajagopalachariar. Here’s an overview of this volume’s contents:

1.  The first article, “Contribution of Vedānta Deśika to Mnemonics and
    Combinatories”, is by the late Dr M. A. Lakshmithathachar, in which,
    as the title suggests, he takes us through the many different ways
    in which Deśika uses mnemonic techniques in his works, e.g., the
    *Tattvamuktākalāpa*, the *Adhikaraṇasārāvaḷi*, the
    *Dramiḍopaniṣattātparyaratnāvaḷī* and *Dramiḍopaniṣadsāram* (which
    both deal with Nammāḻvār’s *Tiruvāymoḻi*). It also explains how he
    uses combinatories, and especially how he solves the problem of the
    knight’s tour in his *Pādukāsahasram*. It shows Deśika’s pure
    genius. The *kaṭapayādi* system is also explained in this, and the
    addition of tables helps us understand better how these things
    function. 2.  The second article, “Śrīmad Vedānta Deśika: A Poet, a Philosopher
    and a Preacher par excellence”, is by the late Dr Mannargudi
    Rajagopalachariar. This article has been written “to recall with
    justifiable pride and gratitude his contribution as a poet,
    philosopher and a preacher” (15). In the process, this article
    touches upon some of Deśika’s masterpieces, e.g., the
    *Yādavābhyuda,* the *Haṃsasaṃdeśa*, the *Pādukāsahasram;* his
    philosophical works like the *Satadūṣaṇī, the* *Nyāyasiddhāñjana*,
    and the *Seśvaramīmāṃsā*. This overview is very useful to have a
    global idea of Deśika’s contributions. 3.  The third article, “A Glimpse into the *Tattvamukāṭkalāpa* of Śrī
    Vedānta Deśika”, is by Dr M.A. Alwar (who is the son of Dr M. A.
    Lakshmithathachar). This work by Deśika deals with the different
    “Indian” doctrines, and is brilliant in that it is a polemical
    presented in the form of poetry. The contributor deals with “the
    uniqueness of this work (…) along with some illustrative examples
    and the depth to which the author delves while explaining the
    nuances of each system of Philosophy (sic) and the finality of the
    Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy (25). 4.  In her article, “The Contribution of Swami Vedānta Deśika to the
    School of Viśiṣṭādvaita” Dr. Vidya Sayinath argues that Vedānta
    Deśika was the main reason why Rāmānuja’s philosophy was sustained.
    Interesting… 5.  In his “Śrī Nigamānta Mahādeśika: The Peerless Poet-Philosopher”,
    Dr. T. K. Parthasarathy takes up the very interesting verse from
    Vedānta Deśika’s *Meyviratamāṉmiyam* (which is the name given for
    the collection of Tamil verses found in his Manipravala work
    *Hastigirimāhātmyam*). The verse in question gives the essence of
    the *Brahmasūtra*s. I guess I should read it, and be done with the
    BS! 6.  As the title “Āhāra Niyamam: Traditional Evaluation of Food as
    Established by the *śāstra*-s” suggests, Madhusudhanan Kalaichelvan
    deals with the fascinating topic of do’s and don’t’s concerning
    food, while looking into Deśika’s work of the same name (i.e.
    *Āhāraniyamam*). A few verses are quoted, and the gist given in
    English. Well, too hard to abide by these rules, although I’m sure
    it’s healthy. 7.  “Swami Deśika and the *Mahābhārata*” by Dr V. S. Karunakarachariar
    begins the second section, which focuses on the religious writings
    of Deśika or the religious aspects of his works. The contributor
    focuses on how Deśika tells Garuḍa’s story in his *Garuḍapañcaśat*,
    and Hayagrīva’s story in his *Hayagrīvastotram* based on the
    versions of the stories fund in the *Mahābhārata*, and in the
    process, he often quotes from the *Yādavābhyudayam* as well,
    unsurprisingly. 8.  “The Significance of Yogaśāstrā (sic) in Vedānta Deśika’s
    *Hamsasandeśa*” by V. S. Vijayaraghavan focuses on the 2nd uchvāsa
    found in this work, in which Deśika touches upon the topic of yoga,
    not so common among Śrīvaiṣṇava writers (although I must say that
    everyday I see more and more references to it in their texts). The
    author uses various works to support his study, including Periya
    Parkāla Svāmi’s *Rasāsvādinī*. 9.  In his “The devotional Lyrics of Śrī Vedānta Deśika: A Brief
    Conspectus”, V. K. S. N. Raghavan brings out a few key features
    found in some of Deśika’s 28 *stotra* texts. My own favourite is the
    *Kāmāsikāṣṭakam* (although I must say that his gadya, his
    *Raghuvīragadya* can have no parallels even among his own corpus!) 10. “Vedānta Deśika’s Maṇipravāḷa Commentaries on Divyaprabandham by
    Dr. M. A. Venkatakrishnan is the sole article written in Tamil in
    this volume (title in Tamil: *Vedānta Deśikan Aruliya \[sic\]
    Nālāyira Divyaprabandha Viyākkiyānāngal \[sic\]*). In this, he
    focuses on Deśika’s Manipravala commentary on the *Amalaṉ āti
    pirāṉ*, called *Munivāhanabhogam* (of which I’ll be publishing a
    study and annotated translation soon), and also on his short
    Manipravala commentary on Nammāḻvār’s *Tiruviruttam* 1 and on a
    Tamil verse (*iṉpattil iṟaiñcutalil* v5 from his
    *Guruparamparāsāram*) that summarises Madhurakavi Āḻvār’s *Kaṇṇi Nuṇ
    Ciṟutāmpu*, a key text. The chart he gives for the study of the
    latter is super useful. 11. In his “Transcending the celebrated horizons of religiosity:
    Portrayal of bhakti in Appayya Dīkṣita’s Commentary of Deśika’s
    *Yādavābhyudayam*“, Godabarisha Mishra examines how Dīkṣita
    appreciates “the other systems of religiosity and represent bhakti
    as a path leading to liberation” (140). 12. In their “Prime Number Theory in a verse of *Subhāṣita Nīvi* of Śrī
    Vedānta Deśika”, Dr. B. Kannan and B. Veera Kayathri call their
    paper as “a ripple in the great ocean of the inexhaustible fund of
    mathematical findings intervowen in the web of Śrī Vedānta Deśika’s
    compositions” (155), with their focus being on the understudied
    *Subhāṣitanīvi* as a mathematical treatise. There seriously is no
    limits to Deśika’s knowledge. How can one be good both at literature
    and mathematics?? 13. As the title “Swāmi Deśika’s Treatment of Figures of Speech: An
    Overview” suggests, Dr. O. R. Devanathan focuses on looking into
    some of the “most striking” figures of speech that he uses, and
    their purposes. 14. And last but not least, Dr. Sudhakshnina Rangaswamy focuses on the
    “*prapattiśāstra*: (aka *the magnum opus Rahasyatrayasāram*) in her
    “Deśika’s *Rahasyagranthā*-s (sic.) Repository of the Esoteric
    Tradition of *śaraṇāgati*“. In this, she deals with the different
    aspects related to the very important and all-pervading topic of
    surrender, as propounded by Deśika in this work. One of my hopes is
    to follow a *kālakṣepam* of this work…

This volume is clearly an ode to Vedānta Deśika, in which the contributors show first and foremost their love and admiration for this towering personality. We get glimpses into his work, and udnerstand why he is loved. And the book reminds us once again what a genius Deśika was, so multi-talented, multilingual, and God knows what other multis. C.T. Indra and her team have clearly worked hard to put this volume together properly (so that there is a certain uniformity among the different articles, and we get abstracts, proper bibliographies, etc.), although the diacritical marks need to be fixed and made consistent. It would also be wonderful if ebook versions were made available. I’m yet to read the articles more deeply, but I’m very much looking forward to doing so.
