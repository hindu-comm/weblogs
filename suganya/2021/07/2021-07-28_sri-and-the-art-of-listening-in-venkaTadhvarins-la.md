Śrī and the art of listening in Veṅkaṭādhvarin’s Lakṣmīsahasram

I gave this talk some time last year (2020), and it was a first for me in the sense that it fully used Sanskrit material. As I had to speak on Śrī, Naresh Keerthi suggested that I pick one of the most exquisite but underrated works, Veṅkaṭādhvarin’s *Lakṣṃīsahasram.* That’s how I ended up discovering more deeply a poem that I knew very little about, but which I found fascinating. I chose this topic because Śrī’s eyes and ears are deemed important for Her role as *puruṣakāra* in the Śrīvaiṣṇava thought. And Andrey Klebanov helped a lot fixing my translations, as the verses were nothing but simple despite their appearance!

Śrī-Lakṣmī is at least as important as Nārāyaṇa for the Śrīvaiṣṇavas, who bear Her name before His, in their own denomination. Most of their works mention Her, whatever their genre or purpose. Her nature, status and role are the topic of much discussion among them. Some Ācāryas have exclusively dedicated whole works to Her, mostly stotras, e.g., the*Catuśśloki*by Yāmunācārya (10^(th)c.), the*Śrīstavam*by Kūrattāḻvāṉ (12^(th)c.), the*Śrīguṇaratnakośam*by Parāśara Bhaṭṭar (12^(th)c.) who was exclusively devoted to Śrīraṅganācciyār, and the*Śrīstuti*by Vedānta Deśika, not to mention Veṅkaṭādhvarin’s (17^(th)c) thousand verses on the Goddess. I’m aware that I’m leaving out many important works like the*Kanakadhārāstotram*and*Lakṣmīsahasranāmastotram*, but I’m limiting myself to the most important compositions of the Śrīvaiṣṇavas

Veṅkaṭādhvarin was from Aracāṇippiḷḷai near****Kāñci, a descendent of Praṇatārtihara, one of Rāmājuna’s disciples, and of Vādihaṃsāmbuda, one of Vedānta Deśikaṉ’s teachers (Srinivasachariar 2004: 513). He was an impressive and prolific poet, gainingrenownfor his*Rāghavayādavīyam*, a bi-directional work that tells the stories of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, but also for his*Viśvaguṇadarśacampu*, in which two Gandharvas fly over the Tamil land, and one of them finds fault with everything he sees, while the other is the opposite.

*Lakṣmīsahasram*, one of the longest poems dedicated exclusively to the Goddess,**is interesting in many ways, not the least because we can notice the influence of many of Veṅkaṭādhvarin’s literary/spiritual predecessors, the echoes of VD’s*Pādukāsahasram*being unmissable. In fact, this work can be said to be the culmination of many centuries of poetic expression in praise of Śrī. This long poem is divided into 25*stabaka*s (‘cluster of blossoms’), and the number of verses vary in each. This vast poetic ocean abounds with hundreds of interesting topics, and I have chosen the important, but perhaps neglected theme of listening, a crucial function attributed to Śrī: as we can see here, no chapter is explicitly dedicated to it.

Now, listening is something special, a difficult aim to achieve. It is commonly said that people don’t listen to the others; or they listen partially only to reply or worse. Nowadays people pay to be listened to by professional listeners. In a world of talkers, listeners are scarce and truly precious. And therefore, Śrī’s role as a listener is paramount in more ways than one, as we shall see. So, what, who, and when does Śrī listen to? How does She listen? And what does She do about it? In what way does the art of listening make Her special? Why is it deemed an important task among the many that She undertakes, if at all it is only a task? These are some of the questions that I sought to address in this talk.
