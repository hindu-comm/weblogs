The Ahobila Matham in Selaiyur

Despite the kind of year we’ve had, I managed to visit the Ahobila Maṭham in Selaiyūr (East Tambaram, Chennai), a couple of times, once in January, and once earlier in July. And I have been thinking of writing something brief on the place, as there doesn’t seem to exist much info on the place. So this post is just a brief description of the place with a few photos thrown in. I’m yet to look into the details related to its construction, and so forth.

The Ahobila Maṭham’s traditional base is, I guess, Ahobilam, in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, where the Eastern ghats add a wild charm to its beauty. The Navanarasiṃhakṣetram takes some hiking to explore, and is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Anyway, not here to talk about that. The Ahobila Maṭham was founded around 1400 CE by Ādivaṇ Śaṭhakopaṉ, claimed by some to be the disciple’s disciple of Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai (my favourite!). For more on this, see at the post-scriptum at the bottom.

It is now one of the most important Vaṭakalai maṭhams. It has many branch-maṭhams in prominent temple-towns and cities, and Chennai is no exception.

It’s hard to imagine a quiet corner in Chennai, and yet, that’s what this Selaiyūr Maṭham is. Apparently the land was acquired during the time of the previous Azhagiyasingar (Aḻakiyaciṅkar), the 45th one, and built in the last two decades, this place is a world in itself. The first thing you notice as you enter is a shrine for Lakṣmīnarasiṃha, the main deity of worship in the maṭham.

If we continue to walk, then to the right is the main hall where the devotees gather to witness the daily worship of the mobile shrine of the Maṭham, which comprises Malolan (Narasiṃha along with Lakṣmī), a dancing Krishna, and many other deities and Ācāryas.

The mobile shrine. It is made of silver and it was gilt in the last decade.

Malolan, who actually wears sandals, always ready to move (too bad we can’t see them, as they are hidden with jewellery and clothes)

Krishna, known as Dolai Kannan here. You can actually receive Him in your place

The main hall sees people gather for worship, which is a little scary during the pandemic, but at least the place is ventilated. It also has space for feeding the visitors everyday, and a little shop, which I have unfortunately always found closed.

The present Azhagiyasingar before the mobile shrine on Kūṭāraivalli day, when hundreds of silver bowls of akkāravaṭical is offered to the Lord

There are quarters where the kaiṅkaryaparas live across this hall, but also a Vedic school, and a *gośālā*, where the cows are always curious to know what snacks you’ve brought them.

This cow was worshipped on Dvādaśī day, when visitors offer her akatti kīrai

The inmates seem to rest in different fenced places.

They don’t hang around free everywhere, thankfully. They look huge!

There is also across the main shrine the Ashram where the Azhagiyasingar receives visitors, and also his quarters.

Devotees pay personal visit to the Azhagiyasingar here

The spartan quarters reserved for the sannyāsin!

The Maṭham apparently also has 18 wells, which is the main source of water for Vaidika rites. It’s incredible how in Chennai ground water is found barely a few feet down! Some of kainkaryaparas told me how they swam in the bigger ones when stuck inside the Maṭham during the lockdowns!

There is also a wedding-hall, where a wedding arrangements were being made the last time I went there. I was actually there to collect material for a study on the worship of the *pādukā*s at the Ahobila Maṭham. The fieldwork proved to be a bit of a bummer, but I hope to have better luck next time (+ anyway, photos and videos of the events are widely available anyway). Still, looking forward to my next visit there!

And, there are so many branches (out of which I have visited at least three), that can be visited throughout India. (Sorry for the bad quality of the photo here!)

PS: The claim that the founder of this Maṭham was Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s disciple has elicited some reactions, and I have received emails telling me that the first Jīyar’s Acāryan was Naṭātūr Ammāḷ. Sure. But here’s why I wrote what I wrote: When I visited Śrīraṅgam a couple of years ago, I went to Swami Deśikaṉ’s shrine, and got talking to the priest there. At some point he told me that Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai was the Paramacharyan of AdivanSathakopan (his Ācāryan’s Ācāryan). He also suggested that I visit the Balaji shrine (I think) barely a few feet away, which also has an arcā of Periyavāccān Piḷḷai. There, the priest confirmed this relation, and even showed a board that had been put up with this information. That’s why I have written here that AdivanSaṭakopan was the *paramasi*ṣya (siṣya’ssiṣya) of Periyavāccān Piḷḷai. If this is not universally acknowledged as fact, then I need to dig further and see what’s actually the case.
