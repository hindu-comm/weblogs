What are the bāhya- and kudṛṣṭi-matas?

Śrīvaiṣṇava texts list and mention these bāhya (‘outside \[the vedic fold\]’) and kudṛṣṭi (with a ‘wrong perception/understanding’ of the Vedas) systems quite often, especially when they want to compare them to Viśiṣṭādvaita. Both are equally condemned. In fact, the story of two deer looking for water is often narrated: one of them chases a mirage and dies thirsty; while the other gets close to a pond but gets killed by a tiger before it can drink. So who is the better of the two? ask the Ācāryas. Bang comes the reply: Neither. Now, the list as to what these *mata*s are vary from one text to another, apparently.

In the ***Īṭu-Bhagavadviṣayam***, Nampiḷḷai (13th c?) deals with 17 of them! And that too, right at the beginning of his monumental work, thereby dismissing them right at the outset, so that he can focus on Nammāḻvār and his words. And those are: 1) Lokāyatika (that’s most of us in this modern world, I think); 2) Ārhata; and the four types of Buddhists, namely, 3) Vaibhāṣika, 4) Sautrāntika, 5) Yogācāra, and 6) Mādhyamika. Nampiḷḷai considers these as the ***bāhyamata*s**. Now for the ***kudṛṣṭimata*s**: 1) Naiyāyika, 2) Vaiśeṣika, 3) Pāśupata, 4) Sāṃkhya; 5) Yogi, 6) Bhāṭṭa, 7) Prābhākara, 8) Māyāvādi, 9) Bhāskarīya (dvaitādvaitin?), 10) Yādavaprakāśa, 11) Ekāyana (claimed to be the dvaitin). After briefly enumerating them, Nampiḷḷai equally briefly dismisses them as being *vyartha*! (and I’m writing an article on this fascinating passage).

Now, yesterday, as we were reading a passage from the ***Āṟāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam*** by Piṉpaḻakiya Perumāḷ Jīyar (a disciple of Nampiḷḷai above), we found a different, and super intriguing list: ś*ākyōlūkyākṣapādakṣapaṇakapilapatañjalikaḷ ākiṟa bāhyasamayaṅkaḷayum, śaivamāyāvādanyāyavaiśēṣikabhāṭṭaprabhākarādikaḷ ākiṟa kudṛṣṭi samayaṅkaḷaiyum pukku*… ‘Having tried the **bāhyamatas** that are 1) Śākya, 2) Ulūkya, 3) Akṣapāda, 4) Kṣapaṇa, 5) Kapila, 6) Patañjali, and the **kudṛṣṭimatas** that are 1) Śaiva, 2) Māyāvāda, 3) Nyāya, 4) Vaiśeṣika, 5) Bhāṭṭa, 6) Prābhākara, etc.’ (OK, OK, I know, in the *samāsa*s above, names and adjectival forms of other names are strung together, but hey, it’s still understandable, and the work doesn’t claim to be a chef d’oeuvre!)

As you can see, Jīyar lists Ulūkya and Akṣapāda among the *bāhyamata*s, but adds Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika to the list of *kudṛṣṭimata*s, clearly making a difference between the philosophical systems and those who propounded them. Any idea why this would be the case?

My idea is that: a) Kaṇāda (Ulūkya) and Gautama (Akṣapāda) wrote the *sūtra*s, but did not invent these systems, so they may have introduced their own points of view, which might have more condemnable points than the “original” thoughts?; b) Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṃsā can be used so far as they help one to understand the Vedas better (being upāṅgas and Vedāṅgas, respectively), leaving out passages contradictory to the Viśiṣṭādvaita school of thoughts. But as independent doctrines, they are to be rejected. Could these be the reason? Any ideas?
