“Kerala Manipravalam” vs “Tamil Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam” – a few thoughts

As mentioned in an earlier [post](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/when-did-the-srivai%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%87ava-acaryas-call-their-language-manipravalam/), I have started reading the *Līlātilakam* with a few scholars, a work that was composed between the 14th-16th centuries. And among other things, the *Līlātilakam* defines what Manipravalam is, right at the beginning. Some of its definitions got me thinking about how the Kerala version drastically differs from Tamil Manipravalam as used by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas.

First things first: the author of *Līlātilakam* begins by insisting that Manipravalam needs to produce aesthetic effects in the listener. And an expression like *cantanam koṇṭā* (“Bring the sandal paste”) can be considered as Manipravalam when it occurs in a “tasteful” passage. But when used outside such a context, it would not be considered as Manipravalam at all. (At least this is how I understood the passage). If used, for example, in a colloquial way (while talking to a friend for example), *cantanam koṇṭā* wouldn’t be called Manipravalam.

Furthermore, the author says that a text can be called Manipravalam only when it has words with Sanskrit declensions, and not when just Sanskrit words are used with the endings of the local language, which instead should be considered as vernacular words. I haven’t read the text further than this, but here are some thoughts I have had.

The Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam does not seem to have any such restrictions. It has been used to write commentaries, theological treatises and hagiographic works, where the focus is not on the rasa that it produces in the listener. And it is noteworthy that it was not so much used to compose poetry (that’s my impression anyway), as most writers that I have read do not aim at aesthetic effects when using Manipravalam. There are many hypotheses as to why they use Manipravalam at all (e.g. to keep the esoteric contents from the wrong audience, etc.), but aesthetic reasons do not figure among them. And while the presence of Sanskrit can vary from one author to another, or even from one passage to another within the same work, it only rarely supplies words in declined forms in these texts. We do, of course, find the occasional *anāyāsena* (sometimes side by side *anāyāsamāka* a few lines later), or even something like *nārīṇām uttamai āṉa pirāṭṭi*, but I would say it’s not all pervading. And I have never seen verbs with Sanskrit endings. I think T. Gnanasundaram (who wrote the very important book, *Vaiṇava uraivaḷam*) would agree.

So how can it be called Manipravalam? Well, the presence of Sanskrit (not int he form of tadbhavas though) is usually very significant in these texts: Sanskrit words abound, as do long compounds, although mostly with Tamil endings. And oftentimes, many quotations from Sanskrit texts as embedded as well. Here is an interesting passage from Nampiḷḷai’s *Īṭu Bhagavadviṣayam*, which describes the Bhāṭṭa-Prābhākaras:

The Sanskrit words are in red here: we see one adverb wholly in Sanskrit (*pravāharūpeṇa*), and a *samāsa*, which is also the predicate, which here did not have recourse to the verb “to be” in Tamil. Most noun bases are Sanskrit, with Tamil endings, and only a couple of words are “fully” Tamil (*illai eṉṟārkaḷ*). As I said, the presence of Sanskrit may be more or less important in a text, but the way Sanskrit is used is roughly like this (although there are no direct quotations here).

Now, the Śrīvaiṣṇavas began using Manipravalam in the 12th c., with Rāmānuja’s disciple Piḷḷāṉ kickstarting the phenomenon by composing the *Āṟayirappaṭi* commentary on the *Tiruvāymoḻi*. And the mixed language has thrived ever since. But no Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācārya has composed a work like the *Līlātilakam*, defining what it is or given rules as to how it should be, at least not so far as I know, probably because their focus lies elsewhere. And although they used Manipravalam, it is not yet clear who used the name itself to refer to the language. It seems Kantāṭai Nāyaṉ (15th?) does in his hagiographic work *Periya tirumuṭi aṭaivu*, but were there earlier texts who did so? I’m sure that the very self-aware Ācāryas like Vedānta Deśika gave a thought to the choice of their language of composition, would have also reflected upon the nature of Manipravalam, and probably even called it by some name. Clearly they knew it wasn’t wholly Tamil or Sanskrit, for they wrote in those languages as well, too. Any thoughts on all this?

I think I should go back and read KKA Venkatachari’s book, as I seem to have forgotten most of his arguments.
