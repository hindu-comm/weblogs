A woman “questioning” Rāmānuja

The *Tirukkōḷūr P*e*ṇ*pi*ḷḷ*ai *Rahasyam* is a highly popular work among the Śrīvaiṣṇavas, found within the hagiographic work *Paṉṉīrāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam* (GPP12k). It is also the main work in a collection named *Mummaṇi Rahasyam* (‘The three gems of *Rahasyam*s’), all consisting of words allegedly spoken by women.

The *Rahasyam* is made up of rhetorical questions, which, in this case, are asked by an unknown woman in reply to Rāmānuja’s query as to why she was leaving the sacred town of Tirukkōḷūr, which he was so eager to reach. So it is one of the few “works” attributed to women in this *sampradāya.* These *vārttai*s (‘phrases’), despite being words of humility, could sometimes come across as challenges, and at others as lecturing words: after all, they are pronounced by a woman who is justifying her decision to a man of the calibre of Rāmānuja, answering him back, with questions of her own.

I was curious to see how many (and how) women characters are depicted here, and it seems that they represent about one fifth of all references. We see that there may be a will to have a relatively balanced list of men and women.

And here are the “words” on women (You can read my whole article [here](https://www.academia.edu/44356539/The_Female_Voice_and_the_Crossing_of_the_Boundaries_of_Scholarship_A_Note_on_the_Rahasyam_of_the_Lady_from_Tirukkōḷūr_with_a_Complete_Annotated_Translation)):

Here are the categories of women:

I’m trying to see if there’s a reason behind these selections. Of course, all of them are”good”, ideal wvwn in a certain way. Even if there isn’t, it still is a fascinating work, and so very popular (with so many popular editions, and discourses). Do you know of similar works?
