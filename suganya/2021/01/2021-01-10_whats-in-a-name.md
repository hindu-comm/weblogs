What’s in a name?

The saint-poet whom we now know as Nammāḻvār called himself Caṭakōpaṉ/Śaṭhakopa or Māṟaṉ in his signature verses, at times preceded by the name of his town (Kurukūr), and sometimes by the name (presumably) of his father (Kāri). The epithet Nammāḻvār (‘Our Āḻvār’ in Tamil) must have been given to him by Nāthamuni (9th -10th c.), when the latter collected and named the different works of the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*, or a later Ācārya around the turn of the millennium, but not much later. And the appellation ‘nam āḻvār’ is supposed to show the fondness that Nārāyaṇa felt for him.

But where does his name Caṭakōpaṉ/Śaṭhakopa come from? Caṭakōpaṉ does seem like a*tadbhava*. But what does it mean? It is understood by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas “as one who subdued the evil humour*caṭam*” (*Tamil Lexicon*,**s.v.*caṭakōpaṉ*), although “humour*śaṭha*” is not an attestedmeaning in Sanskrit, while*śaṭhāri*as“enemy of the wicked” is attested (*Monier Williams*, s.v.*śaṭhāri*). The latter also is acknowledged as one of the meanings (as well as functions) of the Āḻvār.

While explaining why Nārāyaṇa’s*pādukā*s are called*śaṭhakopa*(which is something I will come back to),**in his commented edition of Vedānta Deśika’s *Pādukāsahasram*, Nammāṇṭavaṉ Śrī Vedānta Rāmānuja Mahātēcikaṉ points out that the priests from Śrīraṅgam claim that His*pādukā*s defeated an Asura called Śaṭhaṉ, hence the appellation, as per (a/the?) *Pāñcarātrasaṃhitā.*

However, the traditional explanation is that Nammāḻvār**was called*śaṭhakopa*during the transition from foetus to newborn infant, because he drove away the*śaṭha*wind, which is something that hits the infant just before it is born, and thereby erases its true knowledge of things. Although I am yet to trace the origin of this story, this idea is common among the Śrīvaiṣṇavas.

The twist in the story comes with Vedānta Deśika says in his *Pādukāsahasram* that the Āḻvār and Nārāyaṇa’s *pādukā*s (or even *pādukādevī*) share the same name (*śaṭhajit*), or even that the Āḻvār bore the name of the latter. However, it does not seem that the *pādukā*s were named that (or anything else), at least not in times prior to Nammāḻvār. Besides, in further verses, Deśika says that the sandals bore the Āḻvār’s name. So this could be simply the poetic imagination and licence of a great poet.

Any ideas? Have you come across any such names for the sandals?
