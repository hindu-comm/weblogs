Did Kāma have a brother?

Today being the first day of the month of *tai*, the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa, and Pongal for the Tamils, people are busy cleaning, decorating and celebrating. And I chanced to see the ladies of the neighbourhood draw this *maṇḍala*-like *kolam*/*rangoli*.

And this got me thinking about Āṇṭāḷ’s verses. Her first *Tiruppāvai* verse famously mentions the month of Mārkaḻi (the *tadbhava* of Mārgaśīrṣa), while her *Nācciyār Tirumoḻi* begins by mentioning the month of *tai*, and describes the decorations made for Kāma-Manmatha, so that he enables her to marry Kṛṣṇa:

The *maṇdala* that she mentions is for worshipping Kāma/Manmatha. But how do the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas explain this worship of a minor deity to obtain the Supreme Being? By claiming that it’s not exactly a reference to Kāma (and his younger brother Cāmaṉ) directly. [PBA Svāmi explains this passage](http://dravidaveda.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=776) thus:

Following the medieval commentator Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, he explains that Kṛṣṇa’s son Pradyumna by Rukmiṇī was an *aṃśa* of Manmatha, which makes him the (half-)brother of Sāmban/Cāmaṉ, Kṛṣṇa’s son by Jāmbavatī. Why would anyone worship Kṛṣṇa’s sons in order to marry their father? Doesn’t it make more sense to just take it literally? That is, that she is asking the god of love to help her acquire the man (god) she loves? But then, who is his brother?

The *Tamil Lexicon* has two entries (see above), and both could have been derived from *śyāma*, I guess. Could there be any link with the deity Mercury here? What is interesting is that Cāmaṉ is already mentioned in the *Kalittokai* (in the very grotesque poem that describes the flirting between the hunchbacked woman and the dwarf \[politically incorrect, sorry\], made famous by [AK Ramanujan’s translation](https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/hunchback-and-dwarf)). And the *Kalittokai* must predate Āṇṭāḷ’s poetry by at least a couple of centuries. Verse 94 makes these two names rhyme, but it also adds to Kāmaṉ, the epithet சாமனார் தம் முன் செலவு காண் – ‘see, the one who goes before (?) Cāmaṉ’, i.e. his older brother, or at least that’s how it’s usually taken. I’m sure someone’s written about this. Does anyone know? Does this person exist in Sanskrit literature? Just out of curiosity.

Anyway, it does seem that the making of the *kōlam* the whole month of Mārkaḻi has been done for more than aesthetic reasons. And also probably not just to propitiate in an auspicious way the gods and goddesses of wealth and prosperity. I’m sure there’s been some work on it. Any suggestions? Again, just out of personal curiosity.
