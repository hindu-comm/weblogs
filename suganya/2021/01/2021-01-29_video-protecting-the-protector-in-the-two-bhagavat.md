[Video] Protecting the Protector in the two Bhāgavatams

One of the most popular and influential Purāṇas, even in the 20th c. is the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. It was rendered into different Indian languages already in the premodern period, including Tamil in the 16th c., not once but twice, although they are unfortunately very little known now. So in this talk given on September 27th, 2019 for a webinar on the aspects of Krishna conducted by Sri Vishnu Mohan Foundations, I talk about these Purāṇas in Tamil, and also analyse how close they were to the Sanskrit Bhāgavatapurāṇa? Did they follow it faithfully? Or did they diverge/innovate in order to adapt to their own times, geographic contexts, and needs? While answering these questions, I also tried to give the audience a glimpse of Kṛṣṇa in the Daśamaskandha. Now, as we know, Kṛṣṇa is mostly portrayed as the Protector, but I have intentionally chosen to catch Him in moments when He is in a vulnerable position, and is Himself in need of protection, at least according to the others.
