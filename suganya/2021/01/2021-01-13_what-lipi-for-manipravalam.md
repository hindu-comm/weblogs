Which lipi for Manipravalam?

Vinodh Rajan (of the [Aksharamukha](http://aksharamukha.appspot.com) fame) and I have been working on an article that focuses on the different options that people dealing with Manipravalam texts have had in the last couple of centuries to make their texts accessible, and yet accurately rendered. The journey has been super interesting so far, seeing how striking the right kind of balance has always been a challenge, right up to our days.

So here is how we are going about: we picked a sample from a text in Manipravalam (in this case, Nampiḷḷai’s life story from Kantāṭai Tōḻappar’s *Periya Tirumuṭi Aṭaivu,* 16th-17th?) that is at least easily understandable, and then proceeded to check the different ways it has been rendered (the sample shots given here are not necessarily from this passage).

First of all, a palm leaf manuscript from the [Pondicherry EFEO](https://www.efeo.fr/base.php?code=227) collection:

This uses Tamil along with Grantha letters when necessary, for the Sanskritic syllables, but there are certain rules, exceptions, and of course, the scribe’s idiosyncracies.

And then, an 1898 edition, which fully uses the Telugu script (see above)! This is fascinating to look at! Telugu can easily render Sanskrit sounds, and most Tamil ones, so it can be a rather wise choice. For the Tamil sounds that do not exist in Telugu, the editors seem to have adopted the Tamil letters as they are, for example, ḻ (ழ்) and ṟṟ (ற்ற), respectively:

We can see *ḻī* above, and *ṟṟu* below.

Plenty of other interesting features here, and a historical reason why Telugu was widely used in the Madras Presidency during the British rule.

And then, a more modern edition, published by S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar (1975?), which caters to an audience that mostly knows only the Tamil script (leaving aside the Latin script). So a selection of syllables, which are not commonplace for the Tamil speaker and which could be easily mispronounced, bear numerical diacritics:

I personally find this not easy to use, and slows down my reading, although it has its own uses.

From there, we had a careful look at the orthographies, and found the rules that are at work, the influences undergone the scribe/editor, their results, and the efficacy of the various choices. And many questions have risen in the process: what is considered as a Sanskrit word? What is Tamil? How influential can your spoken Tamil be in transcribing a text, and so forth.

Of course, this is not just about the past and the practices adopted in the past. It still is extremely important to find a way to render these texts as authentically as possible, without compromising too much on their accessibility. I myself like to reconstruct an “ideal” version with all the Sanskrit words appearing in Grantha, plus give the transliteration (preferably with word-split and solved sandhi):

This sort of Tamil-Devanāgarī combination also exists:

Have you come across any other combinations? For rendering Tamil Manipravalam, but also other such mixed languages? Any suggestions for making it easier for an audience that tends to be international, with different needs and capacities?
