[Video] Nammāḻvār’s thoughts on body, samsara and moksha

A couple of months ago, I had to give a talk on the Āḻvārs and immortality. Of course, we all know the premises upon which the they stand: the body and soul are different, the body is perishable, while the soul is immortal; the soul acquires many bodies in many births, which are dependent on their individual karma, and thus cycle of births and deaths, known as samsara, is perpetuated.

A few questions rise at this point: what do the Āḻvārs think of the physical body, because when you speak of biological immortality, the body is directl concerned? and what about the soul? how do they perceive samsara? Do they have an opinion on the body remaining immortal? But then, what is their definition of immortality? Why do they seek divine compassion?

In this talk, I seek to answer those questions, by first focusing on how the Āḻvārs perceive the material body (hint: mostly negative view); how they perceive samsara, and of course, its link with the body is close-knit; what solutions they offer to the problems related to the body and the samsara; and then finally, I will mention a few exceptional cases, when this body and this world can have their uses, hence be deemed positive. I will mostly be referring to Nammāḻvār here.
