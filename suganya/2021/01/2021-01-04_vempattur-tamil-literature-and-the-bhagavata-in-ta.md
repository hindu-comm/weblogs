Vēmpattūr, Tamil literature and the Bhāgavata in Tamil

While working on a paper on the two *Bhāgavata*s in Tamil (one by Cevvai Cūṭuvār, and the other, by Aruḷāḷa Tācar, both from the 16th c.), I made some interesting discoveries: 1) that the Cevvai Cūṭuvār’s *Bhāgavata* was attributed to a non-existent poet called Āriyappa Pulavar, when it was first published; 2) that Aṉatāriyappaṉ (and not Āriyappaṉ) was also a poet, who composed a *sthalapurāṇa* on Madurai called *Cuntarapāṇṭiyam*, a translation of the Sanskrit *Sundarapāṇḍīyam;* 3) it was U. Vē. Cāmiṉātaiyar who recognized the right author (Cevvai Cūṭuvār), and had a proper edition published (albeit posthumously) (See below); 4) Most people do not know of the second *Bhāgavata*, if they are lucky enough to know of the first; 5) Some scholars believed that there are three *Bhāgavata*s, Cevvai Cūṭuvār’s, Aruḷāḷa Tācar’s and… Āriyappa Pulavar’s!

Now, where does Vēmpattūr \[1\] come in, in all this? Well, it’s the birth place/ hometown of Cevvai Cūṭuvār. So what? Actually, it seems to be a town that has produced many, many poets, including Vēmpaṟṟūr Kumaraṉār, a poet from the Caṅkam period.

U. Vē. Cā. lists many erudite scholars from the town in his preface to the edition of the *Tiruvālavāyuṭaiyār Tiruviḷaiyāṭaṟpurāṇam:*

Such an impressive list! This list was repeated in many books, but without appropriate citations, so mush so that I didn’t even know it was U. Vē. Cā. who made the list! And it took quite a bit of detective work to get to the source.

It seems that this Vēmpattūr was a *brahmadeya* to the Cōḻīya (*pūrvaśikha*) brahmins by King Kulacēkara Pāṇṭiyaṉ, something that U. Vē. Cā. discusses in his preface.

So, Cevvai Cūṭuvār was probably a Cōḻīya brahmin. Why is this interesting? Because there is a theory, put forth by Dr. Thennilapuram K. Mahadevan, that both the *Mahābhārata* and the *Harivaṃśa* came to the South with these *pūrvaśikha* (tuft to the front) Brahmins, and that it is also possible that they authored the *Bhāgavatapurāṇa*… Could the fact that the Tamil version was composed by *pūrvaśikha* add to the argument?

Anyaway, I hope to visit this Vēmpattūr some day, which But U. Vē. Cā. situates about 20 miles from Madurai. A pilgrim spot for Tamil lovers!

\[1\] Vēmpaṟṟūr probably got pronounced as Vēmpattūr, and then Vēpattūr. It also known by the name *nimpai (vēmpu = nimbā = neem*).
