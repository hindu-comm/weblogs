Did Rāmānuja write in Tamil?

In an upcoming work on the [*taṉiyaṉ*s](https://www.academia.edu/44761519/The_Taṉiyaṉ_Its_Role_Evolution_and_Importance_in_the_Śrīvaiṣṇava_Tradition), I have been trying to gather the names of the authors and putting together a translation of the 50+ self-contained verses that the Śrīvaiṣṇavas have composed on the various poems from the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham* and/or their author(s). Now, it is generally believed (at least by the academics) that Rāmānuja only wrote in Sanskrit, and not in his mother-tongue Tamil. And yet, the Śrīvaiṣṇava traditions attributed a few self-contained verses to him, the most famous of which are two *taṉiyaṉ*s that he is said to have composed, one each in praise Kulacēkara Āḻvār (see below) and Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār.

Unsurprisingly, it is difficult to prove the authenticity of the authorship of such self-contained verses. And yet, as Friedhelm Hardy (1974: 39fn94) points out in a slightly different context, there ‘is no reason to question the ascription.’ Till we know better (which we may never),we have to rely on the traditional ascribing of authorship.

Having said that, even traditional scholarship is divided when it comes to attributing the above verse to Rāmānuja, as Maṇakkāl Nampi/Rāmāmiśra, Nāthamuni’s disciple and Yāmuna’s teacher, is seen as a potential candidate. What can we do then, except for noting the two?

We know the hagiographic anecdote that narrates that when his disciples, led by Tirukkurukai Pirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, asked him to write a commentary on the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, which he is said to have been so fond of, Rāmānuja preferred that Piḷḷāṉ did it. If he had composed a commentary, would he have done so in Sanskrit, Tamil or in Manipravalam? Because his audience would not be the usual pan-“Indian” one whose lingua franca was Sanskrit.

Well, I’ve never come across a Śrīvaiṣṇava verse in Manipravalam (but then, it depends on one’s definition of Manipravalam), nor a commentary in (non-Manipravalam) Tamil. So although this must be a practice that grew after his time, I still guess Rāmānuja would have opted for Manipravalam, which must have been the way he spoke, as we can gather from the direct speeches given in the hagiographic texts (of course, if we trust them, that is).
