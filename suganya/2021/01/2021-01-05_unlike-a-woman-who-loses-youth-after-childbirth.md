Unlike a woman, who loses youth after childbirth…

While commenting on the words *eḻil unti* (“beautiful navel”) found in Tiruppāṇāḻvār’s *Amalaṉ* *Āti Pirāṉ* (in this case, Raṅganātha’s beautiful navel), medieval commentator Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai (13th c.) explains them in the following way:

The commentator is actually nonchalantly saying that Nārāyaṇa didn’t lose His youth because He gave birth (to Brahmā, through the lotus that came out of His navel), unlike women, whose youth only lasts till they give birth! 🙄

Now where does *prasavāntaṃ* *ca yauvanam* come from? The modern subcommentator, Puttūr S. Kiruṣṇasvāmi Aiyaṅkār, doesn’t states its source but rather gives the whole verse:

*maraṇāntāni vairāṇi prasavāntaṃ ca yauvanam \|*

*kupitaṃ praṇayāntaṃ ca yācanāntaṃ ca gauravam \|\|*

This very roughly means that hostilities last till death, youth till childbirth, anger till love, and respectability till entreating. 

This clearly sounds like a floating verse full of (ersatz?) wisdom. But is it part of a collection? Google didn’t yield much (apparently it’s not omniscient, who would have thought?). So I opted for the next best choice, Harunaaga Isaacson, as it is a for a footnote in my book. And he clarified a few things: the first *pāda* is old and proverbial, and it occurs already in the *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* (6.99.39), as well as in the *Harivaṃśa*. The second *pāda*, with a variant reading (*prasavāntaṃ hi yauvanam*), with further variants in the first *pāda* is found in the *Sāmānyanīti* section of the *Subhā*ṣ*itaratnabhā*ṇḍ*āgāra*, or in the *Mahāsubhāṣitasaṃgraha*.

Well, well, well. The discovery doesn’t change much to the implication found in the 2nd *pāda*. I sometimes wonder what the (invisible) wives of these Ācāryas thought of them and their opinions… Anyway, have you come across verses with similar contents? There must be thousands of the kind out there!

NB: I made the featured image above at the Uttirmērūr Viṣṇu temple a few years, although the lotus stem coming out of the navel is not visible here, and Brahmā is hanging in the air.
