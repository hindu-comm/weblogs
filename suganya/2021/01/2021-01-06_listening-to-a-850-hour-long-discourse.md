Listening to an 850-hour long discourse

It is often claimed that Nampiḷḷai’s commentary on the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, called *Īṭu Muppattāṟāyirappaṭi*, is twice as long as the *Mahābhārata*. It must then be the longest commentary ever written on any given work. It is an enchanting text, which tells us so much not just about the *Tiruvāymoḻi* that it sets out to explain, but also about the beliefs of these Ācāryas, their likes and dislikes, their society, and so forth. Those who want to read it, can access an old edition [here](https://archive.org/details/evenkat_bheltry_BV12/BV%201-2).

And it has been the practice of the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas (especially the Teṉkalai ones) till today to read and expound the *Īṭu* to an audience of initiated Śrīvaiṣṇavas*,* sometimes over many years. Velukkudi Krishnan, one of the established and respected teachers of the modern days, accomplished that feat in three and a half years, and produced a set of 36 CDs worth 850 hours of reading and explaining of this text in 2015-16.

These can be bought or downloaded even now, from [here](https://velukkudidiscourses.com/product/bhagavad-vishayam-thiruvaimozhi/) \[1\].

Anyway, the thing is, I started listening to the recordings of this *Īṭu Bhagavadviṣaya* *kālakṣepam* in summer 2017, and finished the marathon today, slightly less than 3 1/2 years! And half my knowledge of Manipravalam and Śrīvaiṣṇavism comes from this (the other half coming from Puttūr Svāmi’s subcommentaries).

The plan now is to get a big, fat notebook, and listen to the whole discourse all over again and take copious notes, because I’m sure I missed plenty of things the first time over. Besides, I only recently realised that I could simply listen to these recordings at a speed of x1.5, which could save a lot of time without harming in any real way. So that’s the plan for this time.

Have you heard of similar texts? Any interesting recorded lessons of texts (Vedānta, nyāya, mīmāṃsā)? Are you all for remembering, or jotting down info, or better still (for some) to type out the notes?

NOTES: \[1\] As I pre-booked in 2015, I was to have the books that accompanied them too. Unfortunately I only had the first volume, as the others were still being printed, and then both the seller and I lost track of my purchase, so I never got the remaining parts of that beautiful edition 😦
