[Book] Nāvalpākkam Vāsudeva Tātācāryar’s edition of the Śrībhāṣyam

I heard about this new publication in three volumes (2016, 2017, 2020) through a friend, who also put me in touch with the publishers (*Vaiṇavaṉ Kural*). I received these, along with a two-volume *Tiruvāymoḻi*, which I’m yet to explore. This set is edited by Nāvalpākkam Dr. Va. Vāsudevāccār, a traditional scholar as well as a PhD-holder, who apparently is a reader at the University of Sanskrit in Thiruvananthapuram.

**Quick recap:** Rāmānuja’s *Śrībhāṣyam* is a commentary on Bādarāyaṇa’s *Brahmasūtra*s, and an important text that the Śrīvaiṣṇavas are supposed to study with an Ācārya. As Vaiyampāṭi Cēṭṭalūr Vā. Śrīvatsāṅkāryamahātēcikaṉ points out, it’s one of the works that are kept in the Śrīvaiṣṇavas’ homes, along with the *Rāmāyaṇa*, whether one reads it or not. Rāmānuja himself is said to have taught the work to his students, and arranged four students as *śrībhāṣyasiṃhāsanādhipati*s so that they, and their descendants, could teach them. Perhaps the most famous of the many commentaries on the *Śrībhāṣyam* is *Śrutaprakāśikā* by Sudarśanasūri.

**This edition:** The author begins by giving an introduction to the *Śrībhāṣyam,* which includes a list of the *Upaniṣad*s referred to in the work; a list of the 32 *brahmavidyā*s and the chapters (*adhikaraṇam*) in which they are dealt with; a list of the most important Vedic statements (with a Tamil transliteration and translation).

The edition gives the main text in Devanāgari (*sūtra* + commentary on the verso, upper portion of the page), and in Tamil transliteration (verso, bottom), and the Tamil translation-cum-explanation (*tamiḻākkam*) is given on the recto. Super useful for someone like me, who am first and foremost a Tamilist. I have come across other such editions, and I’m sure they are all good, but I’m still glad to have this. Although I’m yet to test the exactitude of the translation, and how free it is. Each volume also has an appendix with further useful explanations.

I’m always interested in how Sanskrit is transcribed into Tamil, and I was struck by this new (?) way devised, while juggling with authentic rendering of Sanskrit and ease of access for a Tamil audience: the simple, voiceless consonants are left as such in Tamil, while the aspirate bears an underscore; the same pattern is followed for the voiced consonants, except that they are in bold letters, e.g.: க (ka), க (kha), **க** (ga), **க** (gha). I personally find this is easier than a text in Tamil script with numerical diacritics, but I foresee printing errors, and God knows what might happen once the ink starts fading after a few years. And it’s not very aesthetically pleasing… Ah well, one can’t have it all.

I also found something that probably is the custom, but that I never noticed: while dating the preface that he wrote, the lamented N.S. Rāmānuja Tātācāryar has added next to the year in Tamil (*maṉmata*), “*māri malai*“, which is the *Tiruppāvai* verse which is attributed for that particular day of the month of *Mārkaḻi*!\`
