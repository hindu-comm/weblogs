When did the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas call their language “Manipravalam”?

This post is just that question. A need to know more from what point of time, a spade was called a spade. Ever since I began reading the *Līlātilakam* with the [NEEM](https://neemerc.huji.ac.il) group, I have started having existential questions, and feel the need to dig into this till I find answers.

**A quick recap** for those who don’t know too much about the origins of Manipravalam (and its denomination). The others can skip this part. *Maṇipravāḷa*m, or “gems/pearls and corals,” is, broadly speaking, a technical term that can be used to describe a dialect or language which combines Sanskrit and a vernacular language. More specifically, it is used as a designation for dialects or languages which are explicitly identified by its speakers, or in its literary corpus, as falling under this general rubric in South India, e.g., Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam.

When was the term Manipravalam itself first used? The Sanskrit commentary, *Jayadhavala* by Jinasena on the Jain scripture *Ṣaḍkhaṇḍāgama* (ca. 9th c.), first mentions the compound *maṇipravāḷa* in reference to the text’s use of both Sanskrit and Prakrit. It is actually in Abhinavagupta’s (11th c.) commentary on Bharata’s *Nāṭyaśāstra* that the expression is first used to refer explicitly to an admixture of two languages. Interestingly, the author calls Manipravalam a tradition from the “South,” in which Sanskrit is mixed with the regional language (*deśa-bhāṣā*).

If we focus on Tamil-Manipravalam: the words of this compound are found in an ancient classical Tamil text, the *Akanāṉūṟū* (3rd–4th CE?), which mentions the now famous phrase *maṇi miṭai pavaḷam* (“coral mixed with gem or pearl”). However, the earliest reference to the compound in Tamil occurs in the 11th c. grammatical treatise *Vīracōḻīyam*. The latter explains that when Sanskrit syllables are blended with Tamil writing, it is known as *viraviyal*, and if it is whole words that are mixed, then it is called *maṇipravāḷam*. However, already two centuries before these definitions came into being, the style had been used in some passages of Peruntēvaṉār’s *Pārataveṇpā* (9th c.), a Tamil retelling of the *Mahābhārata*.

Other than that, the Jains, too, used Tamil Manipravalam e.g., the *Śrīpurāṇam*. But it was the Śrīvaiṣṇavas who extensively used it, with the first extant work being the 12th c.-commentary on Nammāḻvār’s *Tiruvāymoḻi,* namely, Piḷḷāṉ’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi*. This was followed by a series of commentaries, both on the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, and on the remaining works of the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*. Many theological works, such as the *rahasya-grantham*s, as well as hagiographies, were also composed in Manipravalam by the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas. Why they chose this medium of expression is a different matter, and one that is the subject of much discussion (See for example, Venkatachari 1978 or Raman 2007).

**End of recap**. Clearly, Manipravalam was extensively used by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas to compose works in many genres, except perhaps poetry (any thoughts on that?). But did they know/acknowledge that they were using Manipravalam? Or did they think they were using Tamil, perhaps of a scholarly kind? I’m surprised I didn’t ask myself these questions. But then, it may have been dealt with in one of the works that I myself mention here, and I just can’t remember. The oldest reference to the language Manipravalam that I have found so far (without looking too hard) is by Piḷḷai Lokam Jīyar (16th c.?), who lists the works of one of the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas (can’t remember which one), and mentions in the process that some of them were written in Manipravalam. I’m sure there are earlier references. By Vedānta Deśika? Or Maṇavāḷa Māmuni? Or by Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai himself?? These Ācāryas were extremely self-aware, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they did mention it. Anyone has an idea?
