[Video] Kulacēkara Āḻvār’s Portrayal of Kṛṣṇa

This is a talk that I gave a few months ago \[1\], and while awaiting to publish its contents, here’s the video extract, which should last a bit over 20 minutes.

Among all the Āḻvārs, Kulacēkara Āḻvār (ca. 9^(th)c.) is traditionally known as a Rāmabhakta: because, his*Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi*(PTM), composed of ten*pattu*s or decades, dedicates three wholeof them to Rāma. This is something that distinguishes him from the other Āḻvārs, especially his contemporaries, who had a preference for Kṛṣṇa, like Periyāḻvār and Āṇṭāḷ. The modern Śrīvaiṣṇava teachers often say that the Āḻvārs were Kṛṣṇa-bhaktas, while the Ācāryas were Rāma-bhaktas.

This is not to say that Kulacēkara did not praise Kṛṣṇa at all, as he did dedicate two*pattu*s to Him, although his portrayal of Kṛṣṇa in them is as radically different as possible: in PTM 6, the Āḻvār turns into a lovelorn, but betrayed Gopī/ Kulacēkara Nāyakī and heaps accusations on Him, thus producing an enchanting*nindā-stuti*, mixing the*raudra-*with the*śṛṅgārarasa*. As for PTM 7, the Āḻvār veritably turns into Devakī, who deplores at having been unable to bring Kṛṣṇa up as a child.

In this video, we shall now look into more detail at how Kṛṣṇa comes across in Kulacēkara’s words, first as a naughty youth, and then as an infant in Devakī’s imagination, both portrayals by the Āḻvār having perhaps been produced under the influence of the pan-“Indian” literatures of his time, in Tamil, Sanskrit and the Prakrit languages. And the focus here will be as much on Kṛṣṇa, as on Kulacēkara’s female voices, those of Kulacākara Nāyakīand Devakī, through whom His portrayals are drawn.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

If you are interested in knowing more about Kulacēkara Āḻvār and/or his works, or read his poetry with or without the medieval commentary, you can have a look at my book [here](https://www.academia.edu/39068941/My_Sapphire_hued_Lord_my_Beloved_Perumāḷ_Tirumoḻi_and_of_its_Medieval_Maṇipravāḷa_Commentary_by_Periyavāccāṉ_Piḷḷai_with_an_Introduction).
