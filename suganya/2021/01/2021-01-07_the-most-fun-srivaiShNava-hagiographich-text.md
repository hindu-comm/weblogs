The most fun hagiographic text

Composed by Piṉpaḻakiya Perumāḷ Jīyar (ca 1290 CE) the [*Āṟāyirappaṭi* *Guruparamparāprabhāvam*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.384478/page/n3/mode/2up) (GPP) is one of the most important works of this kind, and presumably the first hagiographic in Tamil-Sanskrit Maṇipravāḷam, to which I keep going back again and again. It seems that Jīyar was the great Nampiḷḷai’s disciple, as we can see from the picture above ([Image credits](https://guruparamparai.wordpress.com)).

*āṟāyiṟappaṭi* (*āṟu* + *āyiram* + *paṭi*) means ‘six thousand *paṭi*s.’ And a *paṭi* is a *grantha*, (“A verse or prose containing 32 syllables” *Tamil Lexicon*). It was a custom to mention the length of a commentary in Maṇipravāḷam, a practice that was borrowed by the hagiographers as well.

It seems that the *Guruparamparai* (‘lineage of teachers’) literature was inspired by Jain and Buddhist practices, which consisted in writing about the line of apostles of their faiths. How trustworthy are they? Well, well, well. Scholars like Jagadeesan \[1\] state that the Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographers, despite composing with the aim of promoting their religious views, cannot be accused of anything more than exaggeration, certainly not of ‘serious distortion or perverse intention,’ making the ‘core of the information’ credible, if the historian knows how to filter elements of a religious propagandistic nature. So he does not deny the work’s usefulness as ‘historical source material.’

But it is worth remembering though that the GPP seems to be the first to measure the Āḻvārs’ times in terms of *yuga*s and to accord them an incredible life expectancy (e.g. Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār is claimed to have lived for a few thousand years).

A few more *guruparamparai* type of works do exist and were produced until as late as the 18th c. Ascribed to Piṉpaḻakiya Perumāḷ Jīyar, the GPP is also difficult to date, although it may be surmised that it got its inspiration from the Sanskrit work, Garuḍavāhana Paṇḍita’s *[Divyasūricaritam](https://archive.org/details/Divyasuri-Charitam-Garudavahana-Pandita)* (13th c.?), which it quotes extensively up to the times of Rāmānuja, after which the author seems to compose an original work on the Ācāryas who lived after Rāmānuja (Jagadeesan). Scholars like Chari, Arunachalam and Ramanujam believe that Jīyar lived in the 13th c., although Ramanujam believes the text to be older than the DSC, and is sceptical about the reliability of the available editions (rather than the ur-text presumably).

Anyway, this is an enchanting text, I think, which narrates so many anecdotes, never getting into violent episodes. And it also inspired the composition of a series of Śrīvaiṣṇava *Guruparamparāprabhāvam* works, like the Vaṭakalai *[Mūvāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.384479/page/n3/mode/2up)* and the Teṉkalai *Paṉṉīrāyirappaṭi*. Not to mention works like *[Prapannāmṛtam](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.487516/page/n3/mode/2up).* So many texts that need to be explored, and edited, and translated! We need a team for that!
