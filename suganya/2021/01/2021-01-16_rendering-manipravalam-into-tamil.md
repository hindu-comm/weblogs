Rendering Manipravalam into Tamil

Works composed in Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam can be notoriously tricky and challenging to make sense of, and to translate, even for the native Tamil speakers. Perhaps that’s why there have been attempts to making things a little easier for them, by rendering the texts into modern (albeit formal) Tamil from the 20th c. onwards. The process is sometimes called as *tamiḻākkam*.

The most famous example is perhaps B. Purushothama Naidu’s *[Īṭṭiṉ tamiḻākkam](https://archive.org/details/dli.jZY9lup2kZl6TuXGlZQdjZI6kuQy.TVA_BOK_0002404),* in which he rewrites/renders Nampiḷḷai’s *Īṭu Bhagavadviṣayam* into [simple Tamil](http://www.tamilvu.org/library/l4210/html/l4210tin.htm), with fewer Sanskrit words, for example (and sometimes not quite). This is a monumental work, which is very important if one (especially if the “one” masters modern Tamil) wants to read the 13th-c. original.

Perhaps a little less known is M. Varadarajan’s *tamiḻākkam* of the *Paṉṉīrāyirappaṭi* commentary on the *Tiruvāymoḻi.* The latter (14th c.?) is itself very useful to make sense of the *Tiruvāymoḻi,* giving as it does a word-by-word (almost) gloss of its verses. Except that sometimes it uses Sanskrit expressions to explain the Tamil words…

Although he doesn’t call it *tamiḻākkam*, this is somewhat what Puttūr Krishnaswamy Aiyangar’s *vivaraṇam*s play a similar role for the Manipravalam commentaries on all the works of *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham* (minus for the ones on the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, to my eternal regret, and perhaps a few others). The quality of his renderings into modern Tamil, which is accompanied by extra details and explanations when needed, and their usefulness cannot be overstated, ever. I would say that Puthur Swami’s work cannot be equalled.

There are, of course, Velukkudi Krishnan’s *kālakṣepam*s, in which he makes a point of reading out the original texts of the commentaries and explaining them, in the process of elucidating the root texts. The way he proceeds meticulously has no parallels, to my mind. If there are, then I would love to hear about them (and to hear them)! So please let me know.

Now, how difficult is it really to make sense of this Sanskritised Tamil for the modern Tamil speaker? I guess if one grows up hearing/listening to the Śrīvaiṣṇava *upanyāsam*s and *kālakṣepam*s, then the task might be less of a challenge, than it is, say, for someone who didn’t. And the following words by [Paḻa. Karuppaiyā on poet Kaṇṇatācaṉ’s apparent liking for the Manipravam style](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/கண்ணதாசன்_காலத/YrJdDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=பழ.+கருப்பையா+மணிப்பிரவாளம்&pg=PT60&printsec=frontcover), never fails to draw a chuckle from me.

Well, people will have their opinions, whether it is this author’s, or the Śrīvaiṣṇava writers’. And no point in judging anyone. But I would love to know if similar practices exist in other languages/fields. I think even the medieval commentaries on Tamil works, such as Parimēlaḻakar’s or Nacciṉārkkiṉiyar’s, should also be rendered into modern Tamil (and perhaps they have, and I need to know about them), and of course into English as well!
