Did Deśika spare Dvaita due to his friend?

In his coffee-table book on Vedānta Deśika (which I have reviewed [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/01/12/an-informal-review-of-vedanta-desika-the-peerless-poet-preceptor/)), Dushyanth Sridhar (2018: 128-9) writes about the Deśika’s friendship with the Mādhva [Akṣobhya Tīrtha](https://www.uttaradimath.org/parampara/sri-akshobhya-tirtha) (1350-1365 CE), a contemporary of Vidyāraṇya of the Vijayanagar empire fame, and apparently a direct disciple of Madhva himself. Sridhar also mentions that Deśika became an arbitrator for a debate on the Vedic phrase *tat tvam asi* between Vidyāraṇya (an Advaitin) and Akṣobhya Tīrtha, in which the latter was declared the winner.

It would seem that this victory has been extensively recorded by the Mādhvas, in hagiographic works like the *Jayatīrthavijaya* and *Rāghavendravijaya* (17th c.) and also in an inscription, which includes Deśika’s verse for the occasion, in Mulbāgal (Karnataka). And also in a handful of Śrīvaiṣṇava works, including the *Vedāntadeśikavaibhava-prakāśikā* and the *Ācāryacampu* (Sharma 1961: 230). Does anyone know these (Śrīvaiṣṇava) texts? Or better, have copies?

Anyway, the thing is: Deśika may not have declared Akṣobhya Tīrtha the winner simply because of their friendship. For, it cannot have been a hard decision for a Viśiṣṭādvaitin to choose between an Advaitic and a Dvaitic interpretation of such a core Vedic phrase such as the above.

However, Sridhar adds that some commentators (which ones?) suggest that Deśika somewhat refrained from making virulent comments on Dvaita due to that friendship. Anyone knows which works by Deśikaṉ and which commentaries are alluded to here? I wonder whether Deśika was the kind of person who would spare a *kudṛṣṭimata*, as he must have perceived it (just as Nampiḷḷai did), just because of personal affinities. Could there be any other reason?
