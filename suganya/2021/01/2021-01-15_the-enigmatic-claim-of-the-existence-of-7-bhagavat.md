The mystifying claim of the existence of 7 Bhāgavatas

I have started working on the Tamil versions of the *Bhāgavatapurāṇa*, and there are two of them, namely, Cevvai Cūṭuvār’s*Pākavatapurāṇam*(CCBh) and Nellinakar Aruḷāḷa Tācar’s*Purāṇapākavatam*(ATBh). While reading about them, I bumped into baffling information on the existence of 7 *Bhāgavata*s (not 7 types, but 7 different works): the*itihāsa*-,*purāṇa*-,*saṃhitā*-,*upasaṃhitā*-,*viṣṇurahasya*-,*viṣṇuyāmaḷa*-, and*gautamasaṃhitā*–*bhāgavata*s.And some scholars claim that the two*bhāgavata*s in Tamil correspond to the first two types in this list.

This classification is supposed to bebased on the first*adhyāya*of the*Gautamasaṃhitā*,**which gives the*bhāgavatalakṣaṇam*(‘the types of the*Bhāgavata*\[s\]’), but I have not been able to trace the content to this *saṃhitā*, especially sinceits first chapter deals with the investiture of the sacred thread, and is devoid of any mention to the BhP.

The oldest source for this claim that I have been able to find lies in the introduction to the 2nd volume of ATBh, edited by Pavāni Pāḷaipārati Muttucāmi Aiyar, Ca. Tirucciṟṟampalam Piḷḷai and La. Ve. Tirumalaikoṇṭa Nāyakkar in 1891. It is repeated by later scholars, sometimes with more details, as we can see below.

Those who can read Tamil can have a peek at the kind of details of the 7 *Bhāgavata*s that Mu. Aruṇācalam gives in *Tamiḻ Ilakkiya Varalāṟu. Patiṉāṟām Nūṟṟāṇṭu,* vol.1:

I’ve reached a dead-end for the moment. Any idea where this could have come from? Is it something that emerges from the Tamil land? If so, when? The 19th century? And why?
