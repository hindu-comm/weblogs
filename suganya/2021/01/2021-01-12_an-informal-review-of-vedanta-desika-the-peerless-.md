A quick review of “Vedānta Deśika: The Peerless Poet-Preceptor”

When a year ago I walked into a little shop that sold publications by Marg, the first book that I spotted was this. But then, as they say, one sees what one wants to. My mind was made up immediately, especially after seeing these drawings inside:

p\. 116

A year before, I had received a few palm-leaf manuscripts from an older colleague, and some of them were works by Vedānta Deśika. And one of them was his *Pādukāsahasram*, whose cover leaves were etched with similar drawings. And not being conversant with *citrakavi*, I didn’t know what they were. This book shows more than 20 different such patterns. Totally astounding!

OK, so this book is a lavishly illustrated coffee-table book dedicated to this Ācārya, published on his 750th year (i.e. 2018). The text is by the well-known traditional scholar [Dushyanth Sridhar](https://www.desikadaya.org/about), the photos by R. Vinodh, and the enchanting sketches by an eminent artist Keshav (@krishnafortoday).

The text gives a traditional account of Deśikaṉ’s life story, and the other major topics are about him as a philosopher, theologian, poet and dramatist, each of them mentioning and summarising his major works, and other topics of interest related to him. There are also copious endnotes that mostly give original texts.

p.113

Some idiosyncrasies pop out immediately (inconsistent diacritical marks, italicisation of proper nouns of people, and so forth). However, it is a nice book if one takes it what it is: an ode of love and devotion for a favourite teacher from a devotee (who, as a matter of fact, is a non-academic scholar), produced for the sake of fellow devotees.

p.*99*

While discussing how Deśika had respect for Piḷḷai Lokācārya and vice versa, and that Deśika asserted that there might be “different interpretations of texts” but no “difference of philosophy or theology” among the followers of Rāmānuja, the author says the following, which made me smile (p.132):

> “Thus, research on the Tāmizh (sic.) cats and ‘Sānskrit (sic.) > monkeys’ as some inquisitive students put it, is unwarranted and > surely, not the need of the hour”
