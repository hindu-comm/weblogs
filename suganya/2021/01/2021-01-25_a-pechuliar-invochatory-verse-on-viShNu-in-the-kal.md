A peculiar invocatory verse on Viṣṇu in the Kaliṅkattu Paraṇi

Cayaṃkoṇṭār’s *Kaliṅkattu Paraṇi* has a some of the very uncommon invocatory stanzas that I have come across. For example, there is one dedicated to the Saptamātṛkās. Not sure I have seen another such, really. And just to make sure that no one is left out, Cayaṃkoṇṭār invokes nine different deities! (and no, I’m not counting separately each of the Saptamātṛkās)

Another peculiarity is that what seemingly is a praise of the deities doesn’t quite seem to be that; it doesn’t even come across as an invocation of blessings upon the king, Kulōttuṅga Cōḻaṉ, who is the patron, but rather simply a praise of the king , who is compared to the deity in question through a parallel:

Well, actually, it is the king’s parasol that is compared to Māl-Nārāyaṇa, who lies upon a banyan leaf as a baby, during the *pralaya*, having swallowed the whole world! What is the poet trying to do here? I guess flattering the king while pretending to praise the gods…

Having been used to the Āḻvār poetry (and also the later Śrīvaiṣṇava poetry), I found these verses to be quite a different kettle of fish. Even Kampaṉ’s verse that is a nod to Caṭaiyappaṉ is hardly this brazen. But then, once again, the *Kaliṅkattu Paraṇi* was expressly composed to praise the king, which it does at the drop of a hat, so to speak.

Oh, and the poet does not have any *avaiyaṭakkam* verses (‘Expression of modesty by a speaker in a public assembly, apologetic preface’ *Tamil Lexicon*) either. This is all very interesting, but then, so is the rest of the 600-verse long poem, which reaches the heights of eccentricity and grotesqueness, while I’m still scampering to collect the names of all the species of goblins, ghosts, demons and so forth, and all the different words that are used to speak of bloody, fat, and sinews…
