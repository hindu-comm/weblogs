Regional and dialectal variants in the Divya Prabandham manuscripts

A few years ago, I collated a sample decade from the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham* (meaning, I checked from variants in palm-leaf manuscripts), in order to see if it was worth producing a critical edition of the corpus (and personally came to the conclusion that it wasn’t worth the effort, with hundreds of manuscripts still available, and the variants hardly being significant).

Anyway, I had used Vaiṣṇava manuscripts from the [EFEO](https://www.efeo.fr/base.php?code=227) collection, all of which come from the same source: the Periya Nampi Tirumāḷikai in Āḻvār Tirunakari from the deep South (or at least that’s how I perceive its geographic location). And I found real and accidental variants produced by typos, variant spellings, a few (what seemed like genuine variants), but mostly variants produced due to dialectal and regional differences. Let’s have a look at some of them (it’s the first decade of *the Mutal Tiruvantāti*):

While most of the editions had the formal *ṟṟa*, one of them seems like it’s a typo (or at least a student mishearing the word – *tṟa* – the combination doesn’t exist in Tamil). But the other “variant” with *tta* is more interesting: it is true that *ṟṟa* becomes *tta* in everyday language. Besides, the Teṉkalai Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe in softening the harsh *ṟṟa* into *tta*, so as not to hurt Perumāḷ’s ears… As it happens, these manuscripts were all produced by Teṉkalai Śrīvaiṣṇavas. They also soften *ṉṟa* into *ṉṉa*, which could also be seen from at least one MSS:

And then we have evidence of “Southerners” struggling with *ḻ,* pronouncing it as *ḷ:*

And then we also have occurrences of hypercorrection, in which *ḷ* is transcribed as *ḻ* by the anxious-minded scribe:

I find all this fascinating. I do believe therefore that variants that we fid the *Divya Prabandham* are not of sufficient consequence to produce a critical edition, and that we could always check MSS and note down variants in footnotes or endnotes. I had started writing the article making this point, when I was thwarted in my attempt by someone who insisted that the variants are indeed numerous and important, and that there should be a critical edition. But I still don’t think so.
