The identification of the divyadeśam Śāḷagrāmam – Muktinath or not?

The Śrīvaiṣṇavas have a pilgrimage route all traced out so that they can visit the 108 *divyadeśam*s, or “divine places/lands”.

**A recap**: These are sacred places sung about by the Āḻvārs, and which we can find traces of in the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*. They are divided into *divyadeśam*s belonging to Cōḻanāṭu (Chola land; 40), Pāṇdyanāṭu (Pandya land; 18), Malaināṭu (Chera region – roughly modern-day Kerala; 13), Toṇṭaināṭu (Pallava land; 22), Naṭunāṭu (“the middle region” – not sure why it’s called this; only 2), and the Vaṭanāṭu (“northern land”, from Tirumalā-Tirupati all the way to the Himalayas, but also Dvārakā in the West; 11). You can know more about them from [this book](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496776), if you can read Tamil, or else [this se](https://ebooks.tirumala.org/search?value=Vaishnavite&key=search)t in English.

The classification must have appeared in the early 2nd millennium (I’m still figuring out when exactly). The Chola land has the lion’s share with 40 places, with the most important also being located there, namely, Śrīraṅgam. The remaining two are said to be the milk ocean (which one may never get to see), and Vaikuṇṭha, which the liberated soul can reach.

Only one *divyadeśam* is said to be located outside modern-day India, and that is Cāḷakkirāmam – Śālagrāma, traditionally thought to be in Nepal, which both Periyāḻvār and Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār have praised in their poems.

An example from *Periya Tirumoḻi*:

Both Śāktas (who consider the location one of the Śaktipīṭhas) and the Buddhists consider this place sacred. Śrīvaiṣṇava priests and Buddhist nuns in fact take turns to offer worship at the main shrine. It is not difficult to see why Cāḷakkirāmam was identified with Śālagramam, a place also famous for the fossils known as Śālagrāma *śila*s found in the river Gaṇḍakī, which are seen as Nārāyaṇa’s very forms.

I took these this photo (and the featured one above) when I went there a few years ago.

But… while listening to velukkudi Krishnan’s *upanyāsam* on *Kamparāmāyaṇam*, he hinted that some suggest that Cāḷakkirāmam/Śālagrāmam, as per the Āḻvārs, is located on the banks of \[Kailash\] Mānasarovar… No idea who made this claim, and for what reasons. I have Googled to know if there’s any literature on it, but despite going past the package tours offer, I could not find anything at all. Anyone has any idea?
