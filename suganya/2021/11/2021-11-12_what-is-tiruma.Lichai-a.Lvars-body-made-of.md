What is Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār’s body made of?

While continuing to read the *Āṟāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam*, we came across twice the reference to Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār being a *pañcaśaktimayavigraham*. That is, his divine body is made of five *śakti*s, aka five *upaniṣad*s. While clearly this means that his body is claimed to be *aprākṛta* (not made of matter), how exactly to translate *śakti* (or, ahem, *upaniṣad*) in this context? We tried ‘energies’ yesterday, and added a footnote. But what exactly is that a reference to? Are they the *aprākṛta* equivalents of the *pañcabhūta*s that exist solely in Vaikuṇṭha? How would you translate the word?

Also, this brings us to another question: some texts claim that the Āḻvārs are the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa’s divine weapons, and that, therefore, it means Nityasūris come down to earth. I remember Velukkudi Swami even saying that while it might seem unfair that there should be a set of *cetana*s who were never touched by *karman* (the Nityasūris), others were thrown into the *saṃsāra* (and on what basis were they chosen?), the balance is established by the liberated ones going to Vaikuṇṭha, and the Nityasūris coming down to this *saṃsāra* as Āḻvārs and Ācāryas. And then there are people who say that this suggestion was meant to elevate the Āḻvārs and the Ācāryas, that it was simply exaggerated praise, and that except for a couple of them (like Rāmānuja), they were all *saṃsārin*s with a wish to become liberated, whom Nārāyaṇa uses to redeem the others.

But as we saw above, the GPP suggests that Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār’s body was *aprākrta*. The first three Āḻvārs were not born in a womb either, although I don’t remember anything said about their bodies. And we’re yet to discover what’s said about the other Āḻvārs’ bodies. Is Tirumaḻicai then special? Why? And so far as I have read and heard of his story, he is the only one who performs miracles, like opening a third eye on his big toe and produce a counter-fire to Śiva’s fire from his third eye. Or does any other Āḻvār perform miracles too? Which is interesting, as I’m reading works on Christian hagiography to compare and contrast with the Śrīvaiṣṇava one, and one thing that catches my attention all the time is prevalence of references to miracles performed by saints, which, if I’m not wrong, is an important criterion to canonise them. As Prathik pointed out, Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār is indeed said to have had disciples with powers like walking on the water. But the Āḻvārs themselves don’t go about performing miracles, methinks. So why is Tirumaḻicai an exception? He is also often described as meditating. Does that yield *siddhi*s, although he doesn’t seek them out or misuse them? What’s the deal?

And while you’re at it, maybe you could help us understand this verse, which was cleverly composed in the *cantam* metre, probably by the author of the GPP (whom I’ll presume to be Piṉpaḻakiya Jīyar till I know any better), which makes it sound exactly like Tirumaḻicai (whose exquisite *Tiruccantaviruttam* is made of 120 verses in this very metre). The most problematic was line 1, but also the first half of the second line:

*akkaraṅkaḷ akkaraṅkaḷ eṉṟum āvat’ eṉ kolō?  
ikkuṟumpai nīkki, eṉṉai īcaṉ ākka vallaiyēl,  
cakkaraṅkolkaiyaṉē caṭaṅkar vāyaṭaṅkiṭa,  
uṭkiṭantavaṇṇamē puṟampocintu kāṭṭiṭē*

Is it *akkaraṅkaḷ* (\<*akṣara*), or is it *a- karaṅkaḷ* (‘those *kara*s’)? Or the one as well as the other, in which case, which one is which? The context is that Tirumaḻicai has just been snubbed by a set of ritualists who don’t want him to be accorded the highest honour (*agrapūjā*) at a sacrifice because he was briught up, hence considered a Shudra. So he asks the Lord reclining inside him to come out and show Himself so as to shut the ritualists’ mouths (that’s the last two lines), if He is capable of turning him into the Lord. And then what could *kuṟumpu* mean here? Ignorance? Mischief? Or I just read Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ’s commentary on the *Jñānasāram* and he glosses it as *karman* (presumably as something that causes mischief). And whose *kuṟumpu* is He supposed to remove? The ritualists’? Tirumaḻicai’s? And interestingly, a few such texts speak of the Āḻvārs experiencing what the average soul would experience only in Vaikuṇṭḥa, after shedding their mortal coils, like Tirumaḻicai getting *sārūpya* immediately after uttering the verse above. The plot thickens!
