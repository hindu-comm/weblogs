[BL-EAP] October updates: Manuscripts, and then some more manuscripts

Well, one would think that when the project work is into its third month, things would have settled down, and a certain well-established routine will be in place. Maybe. Maybe not. Other than one of the digitizers taking it reaaaally easy, we have had a couple of other challenges. The most threatening of them was fungus formation on a manuscript (and even on the thick black paper that served to keep the light out of one of the side doors of the digitizing office)! Being in close proximity to the sea is not a good thing for everyone, and is particularly injurious to a palm-leaf bundle’s health.

Pure horror! The manuscripts usually stay in an air-conditioned room (which keeps the humidity levels under check), but this one was awaiting digitization in a room where the AC isn’t used at nights and during the weekends. And I thought that being cleaned and oiled with lemongrass oil would be a protection. Obviously it wasn’t!

Thankfully, Babu Sir knew what to do: first, he suggested that some “spirit” and some “purified water” mixed in equal measures should be used to clean this bundle up. And then, he realised that the combo might erase the writings, and simply suggested wiping with an old cloth soaked in lukewarm water, which actually did the tricky. It was followed up by another coating of lemongrass oil.

But then, there still was the problem of preventing this sort of thing from recurring: so, the storing of manuscripts and digitization will happen now in the same AC room, which will also have black screens that can be drawn to let in light when digitizing work isn’t taking place.

Next, we found that some of the images not being quite up to the mark, as some of them are upside down, for example. So Sarma Sir suggested that we take on Kavitha to check all the images as she backs them up (she has been doing the backup very diligently, and had been the one to raise the red flag when she noticed the anomaly). So that’s another person added to the project!

Apart from Prathik, that is, who has been cataloguing Grantha MSS for a while virtually. He finally appeared in person at the EFEO last week, and managed to meet everyone and still catalogue a multiple text manuscript.

Which contained Vedānta Deśika’s *Haṃsasandeśam* and apparently an anonymous commentary. We need to figure out who wrote it.

One of the frustrating things with this KK collection is that it is rich, varied, and even contains clues as to the exact religious affiliation of the owner and dates, but no names: we just don’t know who the scribes/ owners were, which family and village/town they belonged to. Many of the manuscripts are devoid of any personalisation, as if they were modern books bought from a store, suggested Akane. A couple that do have such info, clearly come from the outside (that contain medical tips in Tamil and offer invocations to village deities, which is so distinct from the references to the Ahobila Maṭham elsewhere and the erudite contents).

Anyway, I also found an exciting manuscript from the Villiampākkam collection that intrigued me on two accounts: it had a perforated coin to hold the knot on the top (and not, I think, an *ōṭṭai kālaṇā* that was designed with a hole in the middle), and the second thing is that I couldn’t read the script although it seemed familiar, like the Grantha.

This was one of the best preserved palm-leaf manuscripts that I have handled. When I showed it to Sathyanarayana Sir, he recognized it as the Malayalam script (which I should have recognized, but simply presumed was Grantha!), perhaps with some portions of Vaṭṭeḻuttu! But Sarma Sir only detected Malayalam, and confirmed that the practice of fixing coins comes from Kerala. So now we officially are dealing with the fourth script (and perhaps language), if we take into account a line written in Telugu in one of the manuscripts!

Other than that, I catalogued this nice copy of Vedānta Deśika’s *Nikṣeparakṣā*:

And also a *Sundarakāṇḍa* (the second in two months), and found a MS with the birth charts of people who lived a 130+ years ago not far from where I live. It felt like I was intruding into people’s private lives… And Saravanan Sir managed to find that one very nice copy of the *Tiruviḷaiyāṭal Purāṇam*, which I had spotted a couple of years ago among the 100+ bundles.

Finally, another October event: I gave a talk named “Of BL-EAP 1294 and paratextual material” on October 9th for the TST (Texts Surrounding Texts) Workshop 2 (“Indian Paratexts across genres of texts and types of support”) that was held in a hybrid format, in Paris and virtually. This is a longish talk that you can listen to if you don’t know about this project, which I first introduce. After presenting the work that was undertaken till the first week of October, I present pertinent invocations, colophons, and so forth found in the manuscripts of both collections, looking at those that belong to the KK collection, which allows us to have an idea about the reading habits of a 19th-century erudite Śrīvaiṣṇava family from the “deep South”, and the extent and versatility of their scholarship, and at the VP collection, which allows us to have an idea of what kind of texts were copied and transmitted among non-Śrīvaiṣṇavas (and Śrīvaiṣṇavas from another part of South India).
