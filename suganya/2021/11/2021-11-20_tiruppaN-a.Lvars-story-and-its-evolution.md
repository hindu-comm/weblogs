Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār’s story and its evolution

Today is *kārttikai rohiṇī* day, the birthday of a very special Āḻvār whose ten verses have captured the imaginations of many generations, and can still cause goosebumps while enjoying them:

``` wp-block-preformatted கார்த்திகையில் ரோகிணி நாள் காண்மினின்று காசினியீர் வாய்த்த புகழ்பாணர் வந்துதிப்பால் - ஆத்தியர்கள் அன்புடனேதான் அமலனாதிபிரான் கற்றதற்பின் நன்குடனே கொண்டாடும் நாள். 10

kārttikaiyil rōkiṇi nāḷ kāṇmiṉ iṉṟu, kāciṉiyīr! vāytta pukaḻ pāṇar vant’ utippāl, āttiyarkaḷ aṉpuṭaṉē tāṉ ‘amalaṉ āti pirāṉ’ kaṟṟataṉ piṉ naṉk’ uṭaṉē koṇṭāṭum nāḷ. 10

O people of the earth! See, today is the day 
of the Rohiṇi-asterism of the Kartikā-month! It is the day that the pious celebrate well 
having lovingly learnt 
the Amalaṉ āti pirāṉ  
      because Pāṇar of worthy fame came and appeared [here]. ```

Thus Maṇavāḷa Māmunikaḷ celebrates the day. The ten gems from Tiruppāṇāḻvār’s *Amalaṉ āti pirāṉ* are so precious and deemed to have such deep meanings, that three medieval Ācāryas wrote a commentary on it, which is the topic of my next book that hopefully should be out by this time next year: our own Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Perumāḷ Nāyaṉār (although this has been contested even by traditional scholars: not that it matters!), and the one and only Vedānta Deśika, who called it the *Munivāhanabhogam*. Deśika completes his commentary with this verse in Tamil:

``` wp-block-preformatted ஆதிமறை யெனவோங்கு மரங்கத்துள்ளே யருளாருங் கடலைக்கண் டவன் என்பாணன் 
ஓதியதோ ரிருநான்கு மிரண்டுமான வொருபத்தும் பத்தாக வுணர்ந்துரைத்தோம் நீதியறி யாதநிலை யறிவார்க்கெல்லா நிலையிதுவே யென்றுநிலை நாடிநின்றோம் 
வேதியர்தாம் விரித்துரைக்கும் விளைவுக்கெல்லாம் விதையாகு மிதுவென்று                        விளம்பினோமே.

āti maṟai eṉa ōṅkum araṅkattuḷḷē, aruḷ ārum kaṭalai kaṇṭavaṉ eṉ  pāṇaṉ 
ōtiyat’ ōr iru nāṉkum iraṇṭum āṉa oru pattum paṟṟ’ āka uṇarnt’ uraittōm. ‘nīti aṟiyāta nilai aṟivārkk’ ellām nilai ituvē!’ eṉṟu nilai nāṭi niṉṟōm. 
‘vētiyar tām viritt’ uraikkum viḷaivukk’ ellām vitai ākum itu!’ eṉṟu viḷampiṉōmē. 

Understanding [it] to be [our] support, we have commented upon  the unique decade 
made of twice four and two [verses], recited by my  Pāṇaṉ, 
who saw the grace-filled Ocean in Raṅgam, which rises like the beginning of the Vedas (i.e.aum). 
We have desired [it], thinking that it is this [decade] 
that is the firm [support] for those who know the nature [of the God-devotee relationship] 
and none [other]. We have proclaimed openly that this [decade] is the seed for all the produces expounded by the knowers of the Vedas. ```

To actually be praised as being “the seed for all the produces expounded by the knowers of the Vedas” by none other than Vedāntācārya is no mean compliment! And all these medieval commentaries are absolutely delectable as they seek to establish this claim.

Now, is anything is as interesting as this Āḻvār’s verses, it is his life-story as we know it now: he was born an untouchable, and he was so devoted to Raṅganātha, that he would sing in His praise from the other banks of the Kāverī (depending on the versions). And one day, Lokasāraṅga Muni, a priest at the Śrīraṅgam temple, collects water for the temple rituals, and on his way back, finds the Āḻvār in the way. The latter was in such a deep meditative state that he did not hear Lokasāraṅga’s calls. The priest then threw a pebble on him, causing him to bleed on the face. And Raṅganātha was angered by this act, and made the priest bring Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār inside. As the Āḻvār refused out of fear of polluting the temple premises, Lokasāraṅgar carried him on his shoulders, all the way inside the temple. The Āḻvār ecstatically sang this *pādādikeśavarṇanam* of Periya Perumāḷ and disappeared inside the *garbhagṛha*. Right?

Well, to begin with, his verses hardly reveal anything of all this. But no matter. If we look at the early *guruparamparā* literature (like the *Āṟāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam*), we find that the whole episode involving Lokasāraṅgar’s “mean” act is missing. The editor (S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar in this case) does include this story in his edition, but between square brackets, and notes that only some manuscripts have this added version. It is also missing in Nāyaṉār’s commentary, in which he narrates the story: one day (after listening to Tiruppāṇ’s singing from afar for a long time) Raṅganātha decided to have Tiruppāṇ by His side, and sent Lokasāraṅga *because* the latter was such a good man and because he had a few qualities that he shared with the Āḻvār himself! So this was no act of expiation. The rest of the story proceeds in a very similar way.

The whole caste-based persecution seems to have come into being later. But why? Any socio-political reasons for that? Is that to produce a fit rival for Tirunāḷaippōvār’s story or something like that? To enhance the superiority of devotion over birth? Maybe. The more we delve deep into these texts, the more interesting the pearls that we find. Anyway, I’m glad to be able to use this occasion to think and write about Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār…
