Why are the dvaitins called ‘ekāyanas’?

Going back to the *īṭu Bhagavadviṣayam*‘s, which some of us are reading and translating (and it’ll probably go on for a couple of decades at the very least), one thing had been nagging me: in the first introduction (*Mutal śriyaḥpatippaṭi*), Nampiḷḷai lists the 17 *mata*s (which I have already written a [post](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/07/23/what-are-the-bahya-and-kudṛṣṭi-matas/) about), and one of them is that of the “Ekāyana”. And Velukkudi Krishnan Swami had explained in his [oral discourse](https://velukkudidiscourses.com/product/bhagavad-vishayam-thiruvaimozhi/) that this referred to the Dvaitins. This got some of us thinking.

Vasudha Mami reminded us that there was a Buddhist branch called that. Why would the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas call the Dvaitins that? But then, I realise that actually, it’s a different word that looks very similar (*ekayāna ‘*one path’, and not *ekāyana* ‘one *ayana*‘, to which we’ll come back, for the answer lies there). So that problem was solved. But Marion recalled that a branch of Pāñcarātra is known as ekāyana (definitely pronounced like that). While digging into that, I read in Overzee’s Body Divine: The Symbol of the Body in the Works of Teilhard de Chardin and Ramanuja that Yāmunācārya refers to Pāñcarātra itself as ekāyanaśākhā in his Āgamaprāmāṇya. While I need to check that with Marion (and also why he did so), once again, the question here is: why give that name to the dvai*tin*s?

And earlier this week, Marion once again found the term used by a 20th century Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācārya to refer to the Mādhvas, viz., P.B. Aṇṇāṅgarācārya Swami, in [his commentary on the *Yatīndramatadīpikā*](https://archive.org/details/yatindramatadeepikalaghuvartika_202003_666_L/page/n107/mode/2up) (Ugh, I didn’t realise that he has also written a commentary on this work!). Hardly surprising: if Nampiḷḷai has done it, then the others would also do so. But why?

Finally, I got a breakthrough yesterday, as I was going through a commentary (attributed to) Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ on the *[Jṇānasāram](http://acharya.org/sloka/apemperumanar/index.html)* (which is my current obsession, as you would have realised from [this previous post](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/the-influential-verses-by-arulalar/)), there you go again! The word *ekāyanar* appears, this time in reference to Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa (cf. the *Rāmāyaṇa* verse *na ca sītā tvayā hīnā*), as the commentator says that Lakṣmaṇa is not an *ekāyanar* like Sītā. Thankfully, Velukkudi Krishnan Swami (whose lecture on these poems I finally managed to get hold of after a year of searching, thanks to Subhadra) explains that *ayana* is a synonym here for *āśraya* (‘place of refuge’), and that while Śrī (and only Śrī, and in this case, Sītā) has for Her ayana Nārāyaṇa (in this case, Rāma) alone (*ekāyana*), everyone else has the Divine Couple as their joint-*ayana* (and are therefore *mithunāyanar*).

Eureka! That’s why the *dvaitin*s are called the *ekāyana*s, as they don’t grasp as their refuge the Divine Couple or seek to serve them together, but rather focus on Nārāyaṇa alone (Well, that’s the impression I got at least)! Finally! I guess, receiving instruction in a traditional setting would have solved the issue immediately. But when we don’t have that opportunity, then we have just keep the quest on. Well, I must say that the search and the eventual answers produce a satisfaction that has its own perks.

\[In an email after this post was published, Marion sent me the exact passage from PBA Swami’s writing, and the context is the same:\]

> *ekāyanā mādhvāḥ. tanmate viṣṇur eva prāpyaḥ. na tu lakṣmīviśiṣṭa iti. śrīsampradāye tu śrīviśiṣṭa eva prāpya iti vaiśiṣṭyam.*

Hey, wait a minute! Why is this word associated with Pāñcarātra?
