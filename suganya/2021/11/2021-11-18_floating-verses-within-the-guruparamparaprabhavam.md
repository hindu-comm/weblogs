“Floating verses” within the Guruparamparāprabhāvam

This is another post on the *Āṟāyirappaṭi* *Guruparamparāprabhāvam* (GPP) (I know, I know, I should introduce some variety into my posts…), but these are some questions that I have been thinking of for a while now, and what could be answers for this particular case, can also serve as hypotheses for others, hence their importance.

The GPP incorporates many, many, many quotations, both in Sanskrit and in Tamil, just like many other Śrīvaiṣṇava texts (like *vyākhyāna*s). The quotations serve as *pramāṇa*s, in that they provide evidence for any claim or narration that is made by the author, to back them up. In the case of the GPP, the Sanskrit and Tamil quotations, when given one after the other, usually in that order, echo each other, and convey the same meaning. The practice of giving *pramāṇa*s is presumably to indicate that the author is not making up some theories and stories, but bases his claims on their (literary and spiritual) forefathers’s ideas. Aren’t they all supposed to repeat what the knowledgeable and wise elders had stated, and not trust their own limited and perhaps flawed understanding when it comes to dealing with serious questions like worship and liberation? The belief is that the Vedas, the epics, the Purāṇas, the Āḻvārs and the Ācāryas all spoke in one voice (*pēciṟṟē pēcum ekakaṇṭharkaḷ* – source??). And choosing *pramāṇa*s from both languages underlines the *ubhayavedāntatva* of the *sampradāya*.

However, the author of a text, like Piṉpaḻakiya Perumāḷ Jīyar in this case, usually don’t give their sources: probably they did when they orally transmitted the contents, or else expected/knew that the audience would know what they were quoting. Except that, we don’t. Not everyone. Not always. And perhaps not even during the times of the Ācāryas, as we see that Maṇavāḷa Māmunikaḷ has composed the *Īṭṭiṉ Pramāṇatiraṭṭu*, a compendium of *pramāṇa*s from the *Īṭu*. That’s so wonderfully nice of him, because the *Īṭu* contains (without exaggeration) thousands of them. Hardly surprising given its length. As for the GPP, the modern editor does the same, and more, since he also translates the Sanskrit ones into Tamil for the sake of the 20th-21st century Tamils, who may not have had the opportunity to learn Sanskrit, at least not enough to read these verses flawlessly. And that brings me to state that the sources for the Tamil *pramāṇa*s (which usually are from the *Nālāyira Divyaprabandham*, but not just) are *not* given. And here we know for sure that the Ācāryas expected their audience to know whose *pācuram* was quoted by them. There are limits to the kind of help they could provide! Non mais!

Oh dear, I’m just going on and on about this without coming to the point: a few verses that appear unaccounted for (often in Tamil) cannot be traced back to any texts (at least not by me). For example, while Kaṇikkaṇṇaṉ is banished by the king, his teacher Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār decides to follow him, but not before ordering the Deity of the town to go with them:

``` wp-block-preformatted kaṇikaṇṇaṉ pōkiṉṟāṉ, kāmaru pūm kacci maṇivaṇṇā! nī kiṭakka vēṇṭā! tuṇiv’ uṭaiya cem nā pulavaṉum pōkiṉṟēṉ. nīyum uṉṟaṉ painnāka pāy curuṭṭi-k-koḷ!

Kaṇikaṇṇaṉ is leaving, O sapphire-hued Lord from beautiful, desirable Kāñci! Do not lie here! 
I, a bold poet with a tongue of integrity, am also leaving. [So] You, too, roll up Your hooded cobra-mat! ```

Where does the verse come from? Did the author compose it himself? Or is it a floating verse that he incorporated in his writing? Or a verse from a work that is now lost? Some of them are very cleverly composed, like a verse attributed to Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār (but which cannot be found in the two works attributed to him, namely, the *Tiruccantaviruttam* and the *Nāṉmukaṉ tiruvantāti*), composed in the same metre as his *Tiruccantaviruttam*, which I had quoted in [my last post](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/11/12/what-is-tirumaḻicai-aḻvars-body-made-of/). Do let me know if you have an idea.

Oh, and also, in the 2006 edition of the *GPP* that I use, many of the Sanskrit quotations (which are not word-searchable for the moment) are attributed by the modern editor to ப்ர (pra/bra/bhra?), followed by numeral references (apparently chapter + verse). And no, there’s no table of abbreviations. And many works begin with this syllable are quoted. I presume that it is the *Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa*, but does anyone have a good edition of it? Especially one that allows a word search? I did manage to find a Tamil version, but seem to have misplaced it. Plus, I would have had to go through the whole text, so that would be a task for the future. Any help would be welcome 🙂
