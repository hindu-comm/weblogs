Sharing a birthday: Tirumaṅkai and Nampiḷḷai

As today is *kārttikaiyil kārttikai*, the *tirunakṣatram* both of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Nampiḷḷai, I thought I should write a post involving the two. Unfortunately, despite thinking for a while, I have been unable to find anything that clearly links the two greats, except for the belief that Tirumaṅkai was born again as Nampiḷḷai so that the Lord of Tirukaṇṇamaṅkai, born as Peryavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, could become his disciple and learn the meanings of the *pācuram*s from the *Periya Tirumoḻi* from Tirumaṅkai himself. I’m sure there are other such anecdotes, but since I can’t recollect any of them right now, I’ll just write about a couple of anecdotes about them individually, which I like best.

So first, Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār: his spirit, which is reminiscent of Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār who I’m working on right now, was such that he earned the name of “Kaliyaṉ” (mighty man/spirited man). No wonder, look at this verse:

``` wp-block-preformatted ஆசை வழுவாது ஏத்தும்எமக்கு இங்கு இழுக்காய்த்துஅடியோர்க்குதேசம் அறிய உமக்கே ஆளாய்த் திரிகின்றோமுக்குகாசின் ஒளியில் திகழும் வண்ணம் காட்டீர் எம் பெருமான்வாசி வல்லீர்! இந்தளூரீர்! வாழ்ந்தே போம் நீரே!   

ācai vaḻuvātu ēttum  emakk’ iṅku iḻukk’ āyttu! aṭiyōrkku 
tēcam aṟiya  umakkē āḷ-āy tirikiṉṟōmukku kāciṉ oḷiyil tikaḻum vaṇṇam  kāṭṭīr, em perumāṉ! 
vāci vallīr! intaḷūrīr! vāḻntē pōm nīrē!

There’s been disgrace here to us who praise [You] unwaveringly! 
To us who roam about being the servants of You alone 
    so that the [whole] world knows, You will not show [Your] form that shines more than gold! 
Our Lord! O You who discriminate! O You from the sacred Intaḷūr! Go, prosper! ```

Hagiography narrates that as Tirumaṅkai could not visit the closed temple in Tiruvintaḷūr, he leaves in a huff after uttering this verse. This is so different from Nammāḻvār’s pining verses. Another example to show that Hardy’s theory of *virahabhakti* cannot be applied indiscriminately, in too general a way. A similar spirit can be spotted in Tirumaḻicai as well, as he gets annoyed at not being greeted properly by the iconic Deity at Kumbhakonam:

``` wp-block-preformatted naṭanta kālkaḷ nontavō? naṭuṅku ñālam ēṉam āy 
iṭanta mey kuluṅkavō? vilaṅku māl varai curam 
kaṭanta kāl paranta kāviri karai kuṭantaiyuḷ 
kiṭanta āṟ’ eḻunt’iruntu, pēcu! vāḻi, kēcaṉē!  
(Tiruccanta viruttam 61)

Did the feet that walked hurt? Was the body—which scooped out the trembling earth, becoming a Boar—shaken? Rise from [Your] reclining posture in Kuṭantai—on the banks of the Kāveri with extensive channels, which cross big, obstructing mountains [and] difficult deserts— and speak! May You prosper, O Keśava! ```

Rhetorical questions, imperatives, and a sarcastic wish at the end. These Āḻvārs were no wilting flowers. I particularly like Tirumaṅkai’s verse above, as I am tempted to say *tiruvēṅkaṭamuṭaiyāṉē! vāḻntē pōm nīrē!* since I have been unable to visit Tiruveṅkaṭam for over a decade, while everyone I know seems to just pop in and out of the place!

Anyway, let’s talk about Nampiḷḷai now. His love for the *Rāmāyaṇa* is legendary. Sometimes, he quotes a verse from the Sanskrit epic to elucidate some point from the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, and before you know what’s happening, you’re reading a commentary on the *Rāmāyaṇa* in Manipravala! No wonder his disciple Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai follows suit, and even goes beyond by composing a commentary on the theologically significant verses from the epic (viz, the *Taṉiślokam*). My favourite anecdote about him is: the lady who lived next door to him was requested to give her place so that his *tirumāḷikai* could be extended. She agreed on the condition that he give her a place in Paramapadam (Vaikuṇṭha), and Nampiḷḷai happily wrote a note that she could take on her way there to gain entry!

Both Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Nampiḷḷai were such great scholars and so prolific that they have remained beacons for centuries. May their light guide us all!
