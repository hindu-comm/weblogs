How and where to learn nyāya, virtually

This post suggests a few means to learn the basics of *nyāya*/*tarka* online or via multimedia based on my personal experience. With a couple of extra choices for Tamil speakers here.

*kāṇādaṃ pāṇiṇīyaṃ ca sarvaśāstropakārakam* – very roughly, they say that nyāya and vyākaraṇa help learn any śāstra. They also say that one should not indulge in “anyāya vedānta”, all puns intended. Which is why I decided to get the basics of *nyāya*. I have written [elsewhere](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/02/21/the-woes-and-joys-of-a-tamilist-reading-paṇini/) about learning vyākaraṇa.

Haru’s course at the UHH a couple of years ago on the *Vaiśeṣikasūtras* introduced a few notions, but as I was utterly bewildered by all the new ways of classifying things, I needed further help.

Some time later, Andrey suggested Devadatta Patil’s DVDs, which used to be available on the Samskrita Bharati USA [website](https://secure.samskritabharatiusa.org/np/clients/sb594/giftstore.jsp) (which, by the way, is rather medieval and user-unfriendly). You can preview the contents here:

Patil is sensational, he makes things so very clear, and that too, in Sanskrit. Which gave me the confidence that I could follow courses in Sanskrit. But at some point, he got too technical (because the contents did, I guess), and I just sat staring at the screen hoping that my brain would catch something, and some kind of epiphany would occur. It didn’t. So it was time to find something else.

I then found this class taught in Telugu by Suryanarayana Jammalamadaka, which went straight to the point and clarified a few things.

But once again, when the difficulty levels went up, it was hard to handle both the language and the contents. Time to find something in Tamil, however important it might be to learn a *śāstra* in Sanskrit.

Velukkudi Ranganathan just then released [his video course](https://velukkudidiscourses.com), which one could also attend for [free online](https://velukkudi.tv). It is in Tamil, and it couldn’t get any clearer. Perfect! And the background information that he gives to the *Śāstra*s in general is invaluable too. The whole method is traditional with a dash of modern technology, of course.

But then, I got hijacked by life, too many things to do, too many deadlines. So half way through, I stopped. Loser! But a couple of months ago, I found a paid [online course](https://www.madrassanskritcollege.edu.in/courses_page.php) of *Tarkasangraha* offered the Madras Sanskrit College, taught by Dr. C. Hariharan, in simple Sanskrit. I really could have gone back to the course I mentioned above by Velukkudi, but I still joined this class, and am still learning with this. So far so good.

In the meantime, the [Srivaishnavabhushanam](https://yathirajamedhamultiversity.net/courses/srivaishnava-bhushana-3-years/) class that I’m attending also includes *upayukta nyāya* in the first semester, which is taught by Tirukkovilur Manivannan, in Tamil. This one is very precise, and so well-done that right at the beginning I got the bigger picture. I wonder whether I find everything taught in Tamil good, or even better than the others…

So right now, I’m juggling between Velukkudi, Hariharan and Manivannan. Thankfully, they all are saying the same thing, for the moment at least. And it should help my poor brain to finally remember some things! And then go back to Patil’s lessons. Hopefully.
