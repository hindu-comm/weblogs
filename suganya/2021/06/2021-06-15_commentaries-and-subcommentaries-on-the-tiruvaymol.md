Commentaries and subcommentaries on the Tiruvāymoḻi

This week I gave a talk on the paratextual material produced by the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas in the 2nd millennium, which is a mine of knowledge, theological, linguistic, social, cultural, and even historical. While most people who know about the *Tiruvāymoḻi* (TVM) also know about its commentaries, fewer people would have read extensively any of those. So my talk gave them some information on these works, and then a glimpse at the contents by reading extracts together. I also absolutely love the subcommentaries, although I need to explore them further… What follow is my notes for the talk (minus the texts that we read, which you can have access to in the video below).

So here’s how I proceeded: 1. Introduction on the Śrīvaiṣṇava commentaries (on the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*); 2. Introduction to the commentaries on the *Tiruvāymoḻi* and their subcommentaries + their authors; 3. Read *Tiruvāymoḻi* 2.4.1 along with its commentaries (and subcommentaries)

**Introduction**: The very first work in Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam was Piḷḷāṉ’s *vyākhyānam* on the *Tiruvāymoḻi,* and ± 40 *vyākhyāna*s on the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*, most of them composed by Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, who was know as the *Vyākhyāna cakravarti*, who wrote a commentary on every single poem of the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*. Some works got more than a commentary, e.g. the TVM, which had attracted 5 main + 1 commentaries between the 12^(th) and the 14^(th) centuries

The five main commentaries are known by their length, e.g. *āṟāyirappaṭi* (‘6000 *paṭi*s). But what is a *paṭi*? 1 *paṭi =* 1 *grantham* = 32 syllables, 6,000 *paṭi* = 6,000 X 32 syllables = 1,92,000 syllables, 36,000 (= the *īṭu* commentaries) -\> 36,000 x 32 = 11,52,000 syllables!!

These works were composed in Manipravalam, with sentences usually having a Tamil structure, with an important presence of Sanskrit vocabulary (words, compounds, quotations…). The language is rich in vocabulary (sometimes technical, but at times also down-to earth, colourful).

**The six commentators on the *Tiruvāymoḻi* are:**

1\. Tirukkurukai Pirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi* : Piḷḷāṉ was one of the 74 *siṃhāsanādhipati*s established by Svāmi Rāmānuja, his disciple and *mānasaputraṉ*. The *guruparamparā* texts say that Rāmānuja ordered him to write a commentary, because if he wrote himself, people would fix his interpretations as being final. The 6000 is a *poḻippurai =* A commentary which paraphrases a text or summarises its substance \[TL\]. It is a short work (like many early commentaries), and Sanskrit is very much present. Also, it has no *pratīka*s (“The first word (of a verse, sentence, etc.”)

2\. Nañjīyar’s *Oṉpatiṉāyirappaṭi* (Traditional dates: 1113-1208 CE). Nāñjīyar’s love for the *Tiruvāymoḻi* is well-known. He is said to have tought it 100+ times (*kālakṣepam*s). His Ācāryaṉ Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s ordered to write a commentary, according to some texts. He had chosen his disciple as his scribe, but the latter last t he manuscript in the Kāverī, and then re-wrote it thanks to his keen memory. The Sanskrit-Tamil ratio is very roughly 50-50. And the commentary also has *pratīka*s. And it is closely followed by Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s commentary and built upon in an expansive way by Nampiḷḷai.

3\. Nampiḷḷai’s *Īṭu* (Traditional dates: 1147-1252 CE) which was actually written down by Vaṭakku Tiruvīti Piḷḷai (1167-1264), who took “lecture notes”when his teacher taught. The 36,000 *paṭi* is one of the longest commentaries ever written, if not the longest. And it is called the *īṭu*. But what does that mean: 1) it has not match (*īṭu*); 2) it involves us in God (*īṭupaṭuttutal*);(3) *iṭu* was lenghtened to *īṭu* (to write, or to put on an armour, in this case, to protect the soul who lives in the samsara).

4\. Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s 24,000 *paṭi* (His traditional dates: 1167-1262). Piḷḷai is also known as Paramakāruṇikar / Vykāhyānacakravarti. He had his Ācāryaṉ Nampiḷḷai’s permission/order to write a commentary on the TVM, which is a systematic piece of writing.

5\. Vādikesari Aḻakiyamaṇavāḷa Jīyar’s 12,000 *paṭi* – the author was Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s and his adoptive son’s (Nāyaṉār Āccāṉ Piḷḷai’s) disciple. He is said to have been a cook, who became a scholar through his Ācārya’s grace*,* to be even known as – *vādikesari* – a lion of a debater! His *Paṉṉīrāyirappaṭi* gives word-by-word meanings on the TVM itself, which people apparently did not understand that much anymore due to the socio-political nature of his times.

6\. Tirukkōṉēri Dāsyai’s *Tiruvāymoḻi Vācakamālai* or *Vivaraṇaśatakam* (13^(th)– 14^(th) c) – her work is not known much. A woman who probably was Vaṭakku Tiruvīti Piḷḷai’s disciple, from Andhra most likely. The work deals only on a 100 pācurams of the Tiruvāymoḻi (164 according to Mu Arunachalam). The author sees the entire TVM as elucidating the meaning of the first pācuram. 

Now on to the **subcommentary**: the *Irupattunālāyirappaṭi* (24,000-*paṭi)* by Sākṣāt Svāmi (17^(th) c.) (also known as Vedānta Rāmānuja Mahādeśikaṉ). He gives references from Rāmānuja’s *Śrībhāśya* and *Gītābhāṣya*, and gave explanations from verses written by Vedānta Deśika as well. His most famous disciple is Tirukkuṭantai Deśikaṉ (a.k.a. Gopalarya Mahādeśikaṉ, who established the Munitraya *sampradāya*)

And then there are two *arumpataviḷakkams.* And an *arumpataviḷakkam* has three roles: 1. they explain the words that are difficult to understand; 2. they give the *saṅgati* (links/relations); 3. they explain the *pramāṇavākya*s + give their *ākaram*. The two *arumpadaviḷakkam*s are: 1) *Aṭaiyavaḷaintāṉ Arumpataviḷakkam* By Āttāṉ Jīyar (18^(th) CE), and 2) *Jīyar Arumpataviḷakkam* by Guṇakarampākkam Rāmānuja Jīyar (based on the previous work). These are very useful to understand the *īṭu bhagavadviṣayam* commentary, which requires quite some help, especially because of its many references to external texts and its oral style.
