Āṇṭāḷ’s Tamil and Telugu weddings

Āṇṭāḷ is often represented in her bridal look, and other than the *Tiruppāvai*, her most well-known decade is the *Vāraṇam āyiram* from her other composition, the *Nācciyār Tirumoḻi*. In the decade, she tells her friend that she had a dream, in which she married Kṛṣṇa. Many a wedding rite is mentioned in these verses. So somehow, Āṇṭāḷ and her wedding with Kṛṣṇa (at least her longing for it) seem to characterise her.

When I gave a talk in Paris in 2019 at an event organised in memory of Elisabeth Sethupathy, who had worked both on Tamil and Telugu literatures, I chose to speak on the evolution of Āṇṭāḷ’s story across time and space, from her own words to those of Kṛṣṇadevarāya’s ***[Āmuktamālyadā](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.389552/page/n83/mode/2up)***, via the Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographic texts. And the wedding rituals described in them were the focus. Here are a couple of interesting points that I found:

In the ***Nācciyār Tirumoḻi*** (NTM), the wedding is conducted by Brahmins:

NTM6.4:*pārppaṉa ciṭṭarkaḷpallār eṭutt’ētti*‘many learned brahmins sang in a loud voice \[and\] blessed’

NTM6.7:*vāy nallār nalla maṟai ōtimantirattā**l**pāc’ilai nāṇal paṭuttu pariti vaittu*“as the people with great utterancerecited the good Vedas, \[and uttering\] mantras, spread out thekaus-grass” …)

However, things become grander with Garuḍavāhana Paṇḍita’s ***Divyasūricaritam*** (DSC), in which Brahmā himself officiates as priest (*pitāmaha* (13.26); *padmabhavaḥ* (13.27), *dhātā* (13.32)). Oftentimes, he becomes the officiating priest in many a divine wedding, like the one between Mīnākṣī and Sundareśvara, at least as far as the modern representations go. But the *Āmukta* seems to be rather silent on this.

But what *Āmukta* does, is describe a few other rites which have become common in the Telugu land now, some of which being common in the South:

\**… pendeṟa(n) vāri lagnamu samāsannaṃbugā(n), vēlpu~~m̐~~-peddalu vaṃpan, guḍa jīrakaṃbulu samudyatpreman, anyōnya maṃjula mastaṃbula(n) uṃciri arthim̐ kanumiṃcul ciṟṟumuṟṟāḍaṃgan* (7.67.)

“Holding the wide veil, the eminent gods lowered \[it\] when the propitious time came. \[At that time\], with a tenderness that grew \[in a visible manner\], they mutually put cumins \[mixed with\] raw sugar upon their beautiful heads.”

This rite can be witnessed in the Telugu weddings now, although the *talamvrāḷa* is rather rice grains mixed with turmeric that is used.

And then comes the very widespread practice of tying of the *maṅgalasūtra:*‘*gaḷamunam̐kaṭṭenu hari maṃgaḷasūtramu pulakal ativa-gātramum̐poduvan*…’ (7.70) “Hari tied the sacred thread around her neck, as horripilation invaded the body of the girl”

And then, the rite of showing (but here, only watching) the star Arundhatī, a symbol of devotedness to one’s husband:*teṟavam̐kūḍi (y)arundhatīdarśanamum̐jēse…* (7.71) – “Along with the girl, He looked at Arundhatī”.

The *Āmuktamālyadā* is wonderful for many reasons, and one of them is how Krishnadevaraya assimilates the “Tamil” story, and makes Āṇṭāḷ a *teluginTi ADapaDuccu.*
