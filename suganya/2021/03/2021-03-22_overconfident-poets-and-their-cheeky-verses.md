Overconfident poets and their cheeky verses

While reading verses, I find some of them more memorable than others, for their beauty, alliterations, emotions, the effects they produce on the reader/listener, the way they inspire. But also sometimes, for their cheekiness. Of course, I enjoy a poet who gives a good set down to the king or god, as we can see in the following stray verse attributed to Kampaṉ, at being turned down by a (Cōḻa) king:

This translation is based on how the verse is understood, but I wonder if the poet really did compare himself with a monkey. And given that in *kuraṅku ēṟṟu koḷḷāta kompu,* neither ‘monkey’ nor ‘branch’ is marked and the relative participle could function both ways, I like to think that Kampaṉ meant ‘Is there a monkey that wouldn’t accept a \[nice\] branch?’, thus belittling all patrons because he is just so good a poet.

There are also *nindā-stuti*s, like this one (although I’m sure there are “better ones”), that I enjoy reading very much:

This is a verse from the *Tēvāram*, and the translation is by VM Subrahmanya Ayyar (1). Cuntarar asks here what he could hope for by worshipping Śiva, who doesn’t seem to be the richest god around. Yigal Bronner’s [article on *vyājastuti*](http://yigalbronner.huji.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/download-6.pdf) is very enlightening on this subgenre. But when I speak of cheeky verses, it’s not exactly the ones that rebuke God (or whoever the words are destined for) for real or as a disguise for praise, but verses that betray a fiery spirit of the poet, like the following verses by Tirumaḻicai:

You will agree that the self-confidence of the poet (which some might call arrogance) is stunning, but maybe not unusual. Have you come across such verses before? He is actually claiming to be a class apart, and probably that even God can’t equal him in his own field. There are verses where Tirumaḻicai claims that while he can’t exist without God, the latter can’t exist without him either. Wow! This would be totally impossible in some other religious systems, I guess.

Whether it’s the nindā-stuti or this kind of verses, they barely conceal the love and affection that the poet feels for the subject. Do you know of other such verses? I’m working on a paper dealing with the topic, and I would be grateful to have as many examples as possible.
