Why one ought not to cross a poet

Tamil poets (and not just them, I guess) are notoriously touchy and short-tempered. One had better avoid crossing them, or else, one might end up being immortalised for the wrong reasons. Or worse. Going through the solitary verses of a 15th-century Tamil poet, Kāḷamēka Pulavar, I found many good reasons to apply the above rule. Here’s why. After eating food from a place, here’s what the poet says about the meal:

Just imagine going down in the pages of history for shoddy cooking! A good thing he doesn’t name her, as he does other people (not that she would know!). It reminds me of U. Vē. Cā. who mentions people who were gratuitously mean to him, or Mu. Arunachalam, who explains the obstacles he faced to publish one of the volumes of the *Tamil Ilakkiya Varalāṟu* because the printer took money for paper from him but played some dishonest tricks on him.

Things can go from bad to worse, if the poet is not amused by what happens to him. So the stories around Kāḷamēka Pulavar narrate that when he was slighted by the king Cāḷuva Tirumalairāyaṉ, the touchy poet, who clearly believed in the special powers of a poet, curses the whole town:

Thankfully, he is asking the evil people of the kingdom to be destroyed, and not everyone. Which reminds me of Kaṇṇaki, who burns down Maturai, but sparing the Brahmins, the women and children, and the cows. Is that right? Can’t remember the exact list now. Anyway, I guess it’s a widespread belief that the wielders of words, whether they were devotees or not, had the power to make their words come true. I wonder why they never tried to curb their temper, though.

NOTES: (1) *cāṟu* can be translated as ‘extract’ or ‘*rasam*’, but I would rather think it’s the name of the dish here; (2) The Tamil lexicon gives the meanings of ‘Tale-bearer, widow’s son’ for the word, but *kōḷ* has other meanings as well.
