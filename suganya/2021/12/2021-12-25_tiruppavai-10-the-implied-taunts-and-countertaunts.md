Tiruppāvai 10: the implied taunts and countertaunts

In these ten days of *Tiruppāvai* *kālakṣepam* with Nāyaṉār’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi* commentary by Velukkudi Krishnan Swami that I have listened to, there are have been many moments that elicited a smile, and there were some laughing-out-loud moments as well. The medieval Ācāryas were definitely not devoid of humour (nor is Velukkudi Swami for that matter, especially when it comes to speaking about little Kṛṣṇa’s form, pranks, and mischievousness). So I thought I would write this brief post to celebrate one year of blogging by writing about such passages occurring in the 10th verse.

Āṇṭāḷ-Gopikā is waking up the 5th girl, whom Nāyaṉār goes to great lengths to describe as a girl who has embraced *paragatasvīkāram* (allowing God to come and take you, without you making any efforts, if I understood this right), as opposed to the girls outside her home, who are trying to wake her up, who are making efforts to reach Him (*svagatasvīkāram*). And they are convinced that if the other girl is so indifferent about joining them and reaching Kṛṣṇa, it’s because she’s been with Kṛṣṇa all night, who must still be inside. Hence the exchange of words (words vs silence,sometimes).

What did this girl do? To begin with, as the other girls had decided that immediately after parting from Kṛṣṇa, they would bath and begin their vow, this girl spoke in the 19th language, and remained in bed having achieved the end in view, i.e. *kṛṣṇānubhavam*! Why the 19th language? Because the land was believed to have 18 languages, and of course, she went beyond the existent languages, which means that she forged her own path!

The girls outside sarcastically address her as ‘mother!’ (அம்மனாய்), so the girl inside, while being charmed by the sweetness of their words, is shocked at being addressed so distantly. She remains stunned, but her silence is misinterpreted by the others, who truly believe that Kṛṣṇa is inside. So the other girl denies that, as the others point out that His fragrant tulsi garlands have betrayed His presence. To which the other girl replies that the reason for this is that He embraced her (perhaps sme time in the past), and that fragrance of His caused by His embrace lasts for a 100 bathings (so He is not here now, it’s just the effects of what happened before)! அவன் ஒருகால் அணைத்து விட்டால் நூறு குளிக்கு நிற்கும்! She was innocent of the offence that they accused her of!

And then begins the next major taunt: that the girl fought with Kumbhakarṇa and defeated him in a sleep context, so he gave her his sleep, just as the loser offers his best weapon to the winner. Like Paraśurāma gave Viṣṇu’s bow to Rāma when defeated by Him. At least Kumbhakarṇa slept for 6 consecutive months, and then woke for a day in order to eat, and then got back to sleep. This girl doesn’t even seem to do that! அவனுக்கு ஆறுமாஸம் உறங்குகையும், ஆறுமாஸத்துக்கொரு நாள் உணர்ந்திருக்கையுமென்று ஒரு வ்யவஸ்தை₂ உண்டிறே? அங்ஙனமொன்றில்லையோ உனக்கு? நீ காலதத்த்வம் உள்ளதனையும் உறங்குகிறாயன்றோ? You’ll be sleeping till time exists! His is sleep (துயில்), hers is great sleep பெருந்துயில்.

And the other girl is upset: just because she tarried getting up for half-a-second, they have compared her with someone who had performed *asahyāpacāram*!! “ந க்ஷமாமி” என்கிற அஸஹ்யாபசாரம் பண்ணினவனை அரைக்ஷணம் உணராதேயிருக்கிற நமக்கு ஒப்பாக சொல்லா நின்றார்கள்! So she pretends to just wake up and shows herself. And the other girls are very much impressed with the way she looks, and celebrate her *aruṅkalamē* – a woman who is hard to achieve!

But what happened to Kumbhakarṇa to whom she was compared in a moment of irritation? Well, we all know that: he fell into the mouth of Death (*kūṟṟam*) thanks to the Puṇṇiyaṉ. In what way is He a pure one, especially since His killing of a foe is mentioned immediately after? Well, He was the Emerald Pond that Daśaratha begot (தயரதன் பெற்ற மரதக மணித்தடம்), and gives bliss to anyone who descends into Him. Not His fault if some people fall into it and kill themselves! தண்ணீர் குடிக்கக் கல்லின ஏரியிலே தலைகீழாக விழுந்து சாவாரைப் போலே! And Nāyaṉār continues, like a moth that falls into a flame that was lit in order to see things.

And the previous days, Velukkudi Swami also insisted that even Kṛṣṇa didn’t go out of His way to kill anyone. They just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When a hungry Kṛṣṇa kicked in the air, the wheel-Asura appeared there right then to kill Him, but got killed instead. When the wrestlers in Mathurā pounced on Him, He just moved to the right, left, front, back or ducked, so they just killed each other… Why blame an innocent?
