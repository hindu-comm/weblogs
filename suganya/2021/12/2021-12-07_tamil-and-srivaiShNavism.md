Tamil and Śrīvaiṣṇavism

This is perhaps the first out of at least two posts, and make no mistake, it’s by no means an original topic, but one that has caused much ink to be shed. But, as I have a blog AND an opinion on the question, I’m writing this post.

As I was browsing through the book collection on [Lifco’s website](https://www.lifcobooks.com), I found a book called *Śrī Rāmā*ṉ*ujariṉ tamiḻt toṇṭu* (‘Rāmānuja’s service to Tamil’). I ordered the book, and I’ve got it here, but I’ll probably write about it at a later date. But the topic got me thinking about the general perception of the Śrīvaiṣṇavas by the Tamils in general. **Disclaimer**: I’ll totally stay out of politics, so I’m not expressing my political ideas here (which are far and few anyway).

It is often thought that the Śaivas are more into Tamil than the Vaiṣṇavas, as they worship *teṉṉāṭuṭaiya civaṉ* (‘Śiva of the Southern land’) after all. I have absolutely no doubt that the Śaivas contributed to the growth of Tamil, and not just the Nāyaṉmārs, but also the later ones. Think of the *maṭha*s that fostered the study of Tamil, like the one that patronised U. Vē. Cāmiṉātaiyar’s teacher, Mīnākṣisundaram Piḷḷai at some point in his life. Absolutely admirable and praiseworthy! However, I just feel, as an academic, that to dismiss the Vaiṣṇavas’ love for the language unfair, an attitude that was certainly caused by a lack of awareness and knowledge of the Vaiṣṇava literature. How can anyone ignore the 4000 verses? If the objection is to the second-millennium Śrīvaiṣṇava literature in Tamil (or lack thereof, according to some), even there, there are many gems of Tamil poetry produced by the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, which few Tamil people seem to know. Let me give you an example.

Three to four years ago, I gave a talk at the EFEO in Pondicherry at a NETamil workshop called “School Formation” (whatever that meant), and I used verses from Vedānta Deśika’s *Adhikārasaṅgraham* and *Prabandhasāram*, as well as Maṇavāḷa Māmuni’s *Upadeśa Rattiṉamālai*. The audience, of course, consisted exclusively of scholars, both Indian and otherwise. And when I recited the 1st verse from *Adhikārasaṅgraham* (putting in the right emotion), I almost saw a kind of pleased shock on Dr. Rajeswari’s face:

``` wp-block-preformatted பொய்கைமுனி பூதத்தார் பேயாழ்வார் தண் 
    பொருநல்வருங்குருகேசன் விட்டுசித்தன் 
துய்யகுலசேகரன் நம் பாணநாதன் 
    தொண்டரடிப்பொடி மழிசைவந்த சோதி வையமெல்லாம் மறைவிளங்க வாள்வேலேந்து
    மங்கையர்க்கோனென்றிவர்கள் மகிழ்ந்து பாடும் செய்ய தமிழ் மாலைகள் நாம் தெளிய வோதித் 
    தெளியாத மறை நிலங்கள் தெளிகின்றோமே.

poykaimuṉi pūtattār pēyāḻvār taṇ 
    porunal varum kurukēcaṉ viṭṭucittaṉ 
tuyya kulacēkaraṉ nam pāṇanātaṉ 
    toṇṭaraṭippoṭi maḻicaivanta cōti vaiyam ellām maṟai viḷaṅka vāḷ vēl ēntu
    maṅkaiyar kōṉ eṉṟ' ivarkaḷ makiḻntu pāṭum ceyya tamiḻ mālaikaḷ nām teḷiya ōti 
    teḷiyāta maṟai nilaṅkaḷ teḷikiṉṟōmē.

We recite with clarity the garlands in perfect Tamil that these people, 
       --- the ascetic Poykai, the revered Pūtam, Pēyāḻvār,
       the lord of Kuruk[ūr] in which the cool Porunal flows,
       Viṣṇucitta, the pure[-hearted] Kulaśekhara, our lord 
       Pāṇa, Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi, the light that came to Maḻicai,
       the king of the Maṅkai people who held a sword and a 
       spear so that the Vedas shine in the whole world---  
sing in rejoicingly, and we understand the unclear parts of the Vedas! ```

In other words, Vedāntācārya is claiming that he used the *Divyaprabandham* in Tamil that enlightened the Vedic passages that were obscure. So much for portraying him as someone who preferred the Vedas and Sanskrit, to the detriment of Tamil!

Another unspoken (or perhaps is it vocal?) accusation is the perceived exclusivism of the Śrīvaiṣṇavas. And as I read out the following verse from the *Upadeśa rattiṉamālai*, the Tamils in the audience had a stunned look:

``` wp-block-preformatted ஓராண் வழியாய் உபதேசித்தார் முன்னோர் ஏரார் எதிராசர் இன்னருளால் - பாருலகில் ஆசை உடையோர்க்கு எல்லாம் ஆரியர்காள் கூறுமென்று பேசி வரம்பறுத்தார் பின். 37

ōrāṇvaḻi āy upatēcittār muṉṉōr. ēr ār etirācar iṉ aruḷāl, ‘pār ulakil ācai uṭaiyōrkk’ ellām, āriyarkāḷ! kūṟum!’ eṉṟu pēci, varamp’ aṟuttār piṉ . 37

The ancients instructed in an [unbroken] line, from one man [to another]. Then, out of [his] sweet grace, the king among ascetics [Rāmānuja] abounding in beauty destroyed the limits, saying, 
‘O teachers, speak to everyone who has the desire on this earth!’ 
```

For, this is the principle among the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas: give to those who desire. No one who is truly desirous of learning needs to be kept out.(And I had to point out that the vocative *āriyarkāḷ* did *not* refer to an ethnic group, but to the Ācāryas!) Later on, during the Q & A session, Prof Annamalai admitted that he had never heard those verses, or even known *about* them. Probably they knew the episode in Tirukkōṣṭiyūr involving Rāmānujācārya, but perhaps rather vaguely.

As a matter of fact, Tamil is so much part of Śrīvaiṣṇavism that the Tamil *pācuram*s are recited by the devotees from other regions, like the Telugu and Kannada lands, and not just those who are of Tamil descent. I actually was acquainted with a Nepali Śrīvaiṣṇava lady, who happily learnt to read Tamil with me in order to be able to read and understand the *Tiruppāvai* on her own, and her uncle was ready to fly down from Nepal to Pondicherry in order to do the same! Because they recite these compositions but perhaps only with a very general understanding of their meanings. Oh, and did you know that they call the *Nālāyira Divyaprabandham* as the *Nārāyaṇa Divyaprabandham* (as they don’t quite know the word *nālāyira* or what it means, presumably). How very appropriate though!

Plenty of other incidents that I could add to this. I personally think that the love of the Tamil language was shared by all the religious groups in the Tamil land. So no point in berating the others, especially if you don’t know them or their texts all that well.

**Update**: Here’s Sathvik’s addition to this post: “It’s also important to note that tradition is the only Vedantic one of the three biggies to practice Ubhaya Vedanta in word and deed, which is not easy given that the Vedantic milieu was almost exclusively Sanskritic before.” What more can I add?
