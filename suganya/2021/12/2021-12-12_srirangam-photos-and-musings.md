Srirangam: photos and musings

*kāverī virajāseyam vaikuṇṭhaṃ raṅgamandiram sa vāsudevo raṅgeśaḥ pratyakṣam paramaṃ padam* – Velukkudi Swami’s voice was ringing in my ears as I walked inside the Temple, a (quasi-) impromptu visit after over two years. Once again, I felt that Śrīraṅgam is not a place, but an experience, a longing, a dream. No wonder Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai claimed that it was the third *vibhūti*, different from the *saṃsāra* (*līlāvibhūti*) and from Vaikuṇṭha, as Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār sang that he didn’t want to rule over the Lord’s world even if he were to obtain it (*intiralōkam āḷum accuvai peṟiṉum vēṇṭēṉ*), but that he’d rather say out Raṅganātha’s names. Verily, it is the *bhūloka vaikuṇṭham* (by the way, I heard that that epithet is also given to Guruvāyūr!)

This post will only be about the photos that I took and my musings as I moved around as if in a dream, on the 6th day of the *pakal pattu utsavam*. I had heard from my cousins that the crowds somehow stayed away, so that was the right time to pay Him a long-due visit. My aim was to see the Āḻvārs and the Ācāryas gathering together in the Arjuna Maṇḍapam. Anyway, let’s walk towards the temple.

The sight of the *gopuram* even from a distance invariably gives a frisson:

And while trying to hasten inside so as not to waste the little time that I had to spent there, the *maṇalveli* cut our speed, and reminded us of what Parāśara Bhaṭṭar said: take your time, and take in the sights, sounds, and smells (the good ones!) This time I noticed that they have finally opened the library: it’s wide, full of natural light, airy, and… empty. With two staff members chatting, and a grumpy man who looked at me with the utmost spite when I asked him if it was a library. Oh dear.

As the *puṟappāṭu* would already have been over, I went first to Deśikaṉ’s *sannidhi,* usually my first stop, but this time I was only able to pay my respects from afar. The next stop, of course, is the *tāyār sannidhi*.

(By the way, the bell is not at all here, but at the entrance of Arjuna Maṇḍapam – please bear with the random order in which I have added the photos) But the *Tayār sannidhi* would not open till 9:30 am, so from there, the walk was towards the main *sannidhi*, Periya Perumāḷ’s. On the way, of course, plenty of familiar sites, through paths that would have made the *arcirādimārgam* proud:

The Vaikuṇṭha vācal of course. I also saw it from the other side. See below

Such a cool place! I could stay here forever.

The fragrant flowers that had fallen from the trees managed to reach our noses despite the masks

No crowds at all that day, precisely when I wnt.

I hope to see Namperumāḷ here some time…

This Kamalavalli Nācciyār sannidhi always beckons me. It looks so peaceful. I wished I could sit in the back and work from there – work from temple, rather than work from home.

Another one of the nice paths near the garden

How can you visit Periya Perumāḷ before visiting Rāmānuja? I once sat watching the Araiyar sevai, and Mutaliyantan stood smiling at me from one of the pillars. So I tried to capture him here, but the photo came out hazy.

The garden seen from inside the Chakrattalwar Sannidhi

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-10.54.52-2.jpeg?w=767)

Inside the Cakrattāḻvār sannidhi – these passages look so peaceful!

There was a little crowd at the Cakrattāḻvār sannidhi, but thankfully, practically nobody at the Udaiyavar/Rāmānuja sannidhi. And I had never seen him smile so much, his face so clear and brimming with joy! And then towards Periya Perumāḷ: the whole place was decorated for the *pakal pattu* festival.

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-10.52.13-1.jpeg?w=768)

Please notice the paper parrots!

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-10.52.10-2.jpeg?w=840)

Some places were lit up even during daytime!

We then got inside close to Periya Perumāḷ within a few minutes. A few Ayyappa devotees, a few devotees from Andhra. As I walked holding up strung *tulasī*, a lady working there tapped on my arm and told me with a huge grin, “Perumāḷ is in *muttaṅgi* today!” Meaning, the main Deity is wearing a garment fully sewn with pearls! I had never seen Him in that outfit (With my kind of luck, I’ve mostly seen Him in *tailakāppu*, when they apply oils on the body, and put a curtain across half the body, so that you can’t even see His feet!). Anyway, it was so lovely of the lady to say those words to an utter stranger with so much kindness and joy! (Like *Tāyār* Herself, as Vasu mami commented later on, as I narrated this to her).

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-10.52.10-3.jpeg?w=779)

We were so close to Perumāḷ here, and I took this photo, which was not allowed, of course. But come on!

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-10.52.10-4.jpeg?w=757)

Suddenly, there was a power cut, and I almost hoped to be able to have the sevai of Periya Perumāḷ in the dark, like my ancestors would have in the pre-elecricity days. But no such luck.

The people from Andhra were stressed, and tried to stick together and jostle. It would have made sense if there was a crowd. Right next to me, a few Tamil people were also exchanging harsh words with each other for not queuing properly. So with my broken Telugu, I turned to the lady who was sticking to me and slightly applying pressure on my back, “*ikkada haayga chuskovachu, em problem undadu. mellaga vellochu. tirupatila undadu kada?*” Basically, it won’t be like Tirupati here, so we can take it easy. So the pressure ceased and we all visited Him happily lying there.

There were very few people around, but that didn’t stop the priests and the staff from yelling “Move on! move on!” Seriously? But still, I managed to have a good look at Periya Perumāḷ, head to foot, and back again, although I don’t think He had the *tirumaṇ* on the forehead. I wonder why. The lady who told me about the *muttaṅgi* glowed with happiness as I told her that I had never seen Him dressed like that. So she allowed me to stand aside and look at His face for a while longer, saying *nallā perumāḷa seviṅga, nārāyaṇā!* Her smile made my day! As did many other things on that day. I left the place, repeating constantly “Call me back again, call me back again!” Usually I can’t remember any slokas or anything at all when before the Deities. So I just said this and left.

- top: that’s the pādukās you see after visiting Periya Perumāḷ – Don’t
  remember whose they are… - top left: a peep into the Temple kitchen - bottom right: Kōtai mami once said that unless you pray to to that
  Lakṣmīvarāha on the top right corner (after visiting Periya Perumāḷ),
  the visit would not be complete - bottom centre: this side of the Vaikuṇṭha vācal, these lizards await
  us upside down. Thankfully no ladders like in Kanchipuram to touch
  them… - bottom left: the golden vimānam – from another angle, from near the
  Arjuna *maṇḍapam*, you can see Paravāsudeva as well, whom apparently
  you can’t spot from elsewhere.

Now that we had visited Periya Perumāḷ, time to visit Nampeumāḷ who held court in the Arjuna *maṇḍapam* with all the Āḻvārs and the Ācāryas including Rāmānuja, Piḷḷai Lokācārya and Kūrattāḻvāṉ, whose moustache I was able to see from close quarters. The *goṣṭi* was done, but the reciters were gathered there, and I spotted once again MAV Swami and his wife, this time along with his son. Anyway, time to visit the Āḻvārs and the Ācāryas. I was hoping to photograph them individually, as it could have come in handy for book covers or articles, but no point in offending people. I was happy enough to be allowed in. And Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār simply stole the show, I must say!

I didn’t dare take a photo from the front, so here you have a hidden Namperumāḷ!

I wished a photo of the beauty of His back, so I had to beg the security guy to let me take this one shot

You can see MAV Swami to the left

Happy moments to stand between Kulaśekhara Āḻvār (whose poetry I have studied extensively) and Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār (about whose poetry I have written an extensive book, to come out next year) (see photo at the bottom). On the way out, I noticed this Lakṣmivarāha, whom people may have started to worship separately:

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-11.59.05.jpeg?w=768)

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-12-at-11.59.04.jpeg?w=606)

From here, I headed straight towards *Tāyār sannidhi* again and this time, despite the crowd and the constant *pōmmā pōmmā*, I got a glimpse of the Tāyār. And as I had forgotten to recite the *Śrīraṅga Gadyam* at the Udaiyavar *sannidhi* as I had planned, I sat in the *prakāra* close to Tāyār and recited it there. Hope to have many more occasions to do so.

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-10-at-11.33.51-1.jpeg?w=574)

Actually I looked up to see the board on which the Āḻvār’s name was written – Kulaśekhara in this case, as the outfit hid all signs of who they might be

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/whatsapp-image-2021-12-10-at-11.33.51.jpeg?w=777)

Reciting the Śrīraṅgagadyam

From there, I tried to go to the Srivaishnavasri bookshop, walking barefoot on that hot street filled with pebbles. Only to find the shop shut. I called Vasudevan Swami but he didn’t pick up the phone. Too bad. A stray dog rose to follow me inside the shop, but I tried to dissuade him explaining to him that I couldn’t open somebody else’s door. He refused to understand and started to whimper. By that time, my cousin’s son came on his bike to pick me up, so I fed the dog some bread I had, said bye to him and left. I do wish I could give a home to all the stray animals in this region, sigh.

And it was time to leave, a) because I didn’t want anything else to spoil the experience for me, and b) I had to get back home from for the last day of the Vaishnava Material Culture workshop. I wish I could go away to Raṅgam more often. Anyway, I also used the occasion to submit to Him all the requests for blessings that I had received via social media as well. Can’t wait to go back again! So long, *Araṅkattammā*!
