Kulaśekhara’s Rāma verses

Last week or so, I read a few Rāma verses by Kulaśekhara Āḻvār at a virtual event called “Multivalence of an Epic: Texts & Recitations of the Rāmāyaṇa” by the International Research Division, India International Centre in Delhi. Participants explained and read from the various *Rāmāyaṇa*s from across the subcontinent and beyond. Of course, not having had the opportunity to learn the *cantai* (*santhai*), I could not chant it: I only tried once at the beginning and got the rhythm wrong, although I practised that one verse many times over before the end! Too bad, but there you go.

Anyway, this post can only be interesting to those who don’t know this Āḻvār. In the video, I read all 22 out of the 33 Rāma verses, by briefly introducing them and linking them up to the common topic of the decade. Here’s my introduction of the Āḻvār, followed by the video link:

Introduction: The *Rāmāyaṇa* itself has been known to the Tamils since at least the beginning of the first millennium, as there are a couple of references to it in the classical Tamil poetry.However, it won’t be an exaggeration to claim that it was Kulaśekhara Āḻvār who made Rāma a well-known figure in Tamil literature, perhaps even before Kampan, although Kampan definitely was more influential when it came to making *Rāmāyaṇa* even more widely known

Kulaśekhara is one of the 12 Āḻvārs, Tamil bhakti poets who lived approximately between the 6^(th)and 9^(th)centuries, and who spearheaded the bhakti movement in the subcontinent and beyond.And Kulasekhara himself must have lived around the 9^(th)c. He is often believed to have been a Cera king, and the author of the famous*Mukundamālā*as well, although both claims have challenged, but that topic won’t be dealt with here.

Kulasekhara’s poetic corpus in Tamil, named as Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi by the later Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, consists of 105 verses, divided into 10 decades with a varying number of verses. And the last three out of those ten are dedicated to Rāma, with the last one summarising the whole Rāmāyaṇa in ten verses. So there are 33 verses out of 105 (roughly 1/3^(rd)) reserved for Rāma. Kulaśekhara’s poems are now part of what is known as the Nālāyira Divya Prabandham (‘four thousand divine compositions’), part of the Śrīvaiṣṇava canon, and the Śrīvaiṣṇavas were the ones who gave this work the name ‘Perumāḷ’, which refers to Rāma in the Śrīvaiṣṇava jargon, precisely because Rāma is such an important figure in his*prabandha.* Because although other Āḻvārs have composed verses on Rāma, including earlier ones, or described episodes from the Rāmāyaṇa, nobody has done it the way that Kulasekhara did, nobody seems to have borne that deep, emotional affection and devotion for Rāma that he did.

## Decade 1 – A lullaby for Rāma

The first decade is a lullaby: and it’s a good time to remember that often (at least in the Vaiṣṇava Tamil corpus), it is Kṛṣṇa’s childhood that is celebrated in detail. But here, we have a lullaby for Rāma, which shows Kulaśekhara’s tender love for his favourite Deity. the word*tālēlō*which is part of the refrain and the last word of each verse but the last, which means “lullaby” comes from the sound made with the tongue to make an infant sleep. Another interesting thing that Kulaśekhara does in this decade, which many Āḻvārs do, is to link Rāma to the *arcāmūrti* of a temple, in this case, the temple in Kaṇṇapuram, located on the east coast of Tamilnadu.

## Decade 2 – Daśaratha’s lament

Also unusual, having Daśaratha speak his extreme sorrow, in the first person singular, apparently just before he passes away. This poem expresses powerful emotions and an unparalleled pathos. So in this poem, Daśaratha speaks to Rāma who has apparently already left to the forest, but also to Kaikeyi whom he tells off, and he even once addresses Sumantra and Vaśiṣṭa and asks them if this turn of events is fair.

Please notice all the rhetorical questions and interjections which show the depth of Dasaratha’s emotions and his despair. Please also note that the Āḻvār in this case does not associate Rāma to any temple here, which maintains the poignancy of Dasaratha’s words. One final word on the decade: this decade by Kukaśekhara most definitely influenced Kampan’s as far as this passage is concerned.

## Decade 3. Mini-*Rāmāyaṇa*

This decade gives a summary of the *Rāmāyaṇa* events from the *bāla*– to the *uttara* *kāṇḍa*s. And this is also uncommon because many poets don’t go all the way to the *uttara* *kāṇḍa*. The Āḻvār links Rāma to the *arcāmūrti* in the temple Tirucitrakūṭam in the city of Tillai (Chidambaram) in this decade. Although you will notice that Kulaśekhara refrains from expressing explicitly a few events, like Sītā’s fire ordeal or her later exile. However, he does mention the Śambuka event (a bit of a controversial topic), and to my knowledge, no other Āḻvār praises Rama for this act.

Here’s now the video. To watch the whole event, with everyone’s presentation and recitation, please click [here](https://youtu.be/kgLFeeP_Yxo).
