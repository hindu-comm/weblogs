Alexander Dubiansky and Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār

It’s one of those days when I feel nostalgic about people who have passed on, one of them being Alexander Dubiansky, who passed away exactly a year ago after the pandemic snatched him away. I met him in Paris in 2009 or 2010, and was surprised to see him speak fluent Tamil. Walking on the streets of Paris on a sunny winter morning with this venerable old man speaking in Tamil was a surreal experience. I later got to hear him give a talk on the *Tiruppāvai* at the EFEO in Pondy, a text that he translated into Russian if I’m not mistaken.

I met briefly him again a couple of times in Pondicherry in recent years, the last time being the CTSS, at the end of which he have this mementos from his country to the Tamilists.

One day, out of the blue, I received an email from him praising my book. Whatever that book’s worth, I was overwhelmed by his kindness. And then when he learnt I was going to teach the *Aiṅkuṟunūṟu* last year, he wished to join us. I couldn’t believe my luck! But that was not to be. Two weeks before the readings started, I received an email from him saying that he had unwell, and was likely to miss the first few sessions. Another email a week later to say that he had caught this wretched Covid and was hospitalized, and that he would take longer to recover. But he didn’t.

A couple of weeks ago, I felt honoured to give a talk at the conference organised in memory of Alexander Dubiansky by the RUDN University in Moscow. Although I didn’t have much occasion to interact with him about the Āḻvārs, I knew that Alexander loved (or would have loved) Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār and his spirit, and that’s one reason why I chose to speak about him. I realise that the title of this blog post might be misleading, but there you go, unless one of his students tells me there definitely was an affinity between the two… Anyway, I wish I had done given the talk when Alexander was still around, but some things are not meant to be.

Right. So. I called this talk “Reading Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār’s verses through the lens of the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas’ writings”, which is part of a larger studyof mine to analyse how the premodern Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas explained and interpreted the Āḻvārs’ words and embedded them in their writings, thoughts, beliefs, in their very beings.And this paper was the result of my reflections on how two roughly contemporary Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, one a commentator and the other a hagiographer (namely, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai and Piṉpaḻakiya Perumaḷ Jīyar), understood, and in turn presented an Āḻvār who was quite different from the other Āḻvārs, to say the least. And why that matters, if not to everyone, at least to some of us. The dates, authorships and identities of the people and the works mentioned in the talk have been more or less questioned, debated, but they don’t matter much for this study, which is more interested in how a text was received by a certain set of people at roughly a certain point of time, and what they made of it.

So I began by reading a few apparently irreverent, provocative verses by this Āḻvār, and then analysed how the commentator PeriyavāccāṉPiḷḷai reacts to them, and then finally, I focused on what hagiographer makes of them. The idea was to see whether the genre that they wrote it had any effects on how they interpreted some of the words of the Āḻvār, and it very much did! Here’s the full talk if you are curious to know more.
