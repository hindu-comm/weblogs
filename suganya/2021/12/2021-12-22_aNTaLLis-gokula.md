Āṇṭāḷ’s Gokula

Āṇṭāḷ-Gopikā promises in the third verse that if she and her friends undertake the *pāvai* vow, singing about the Perfect One who measured the worlds, Gokula will turn into as fertile and prosperous a place as it gets: the cowherds’ hamlet will be filled with generous milch cows and playful calves, as paddy will thrive with the timely rains, allowing the carp to navigate among their stems; and bees will sleep in the blue nelumbos. This portrait of an idyllic Gokula has the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas’ imagination run wild. Everything is big and nice, for with Kṛṣṇa around, everything becomes larger than life. The larger, the better! Here are a few examples:

I heard in one of the *kālakṣepam*s the other day that Vāmana was so short that even Lilliputians (yes, Lilliputians!) would seem like giants to Him. But He grows so fast, that the water poured to perform the *dāna* by Mahābali and the water poured to worship His lifted foot by Brahmā in Satyaloka hit the ground at the same time! But even He is rivalled by the height of the paddy stems in Gokula, which touch the sky! And the carp that leap about due to the lack of space in the huge rain-fed, water-filled paddy-fields, are as big as elephant calves, says Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai! செருக்காலே யானைக்கன்றுபோலே வளர்ந்த கயல்களானவை செந்நெல்களின் உள்ளே புக்குப் போர இடம் பொறாமையாலே துள்ளா நிற்கும்.

And how are the cows? Well, it is enough to touch their udders, and milk flow on their own and fill pot after pot, because other than grass and water, they grew up with Kṛṣṇa’s touch (க்ருஷ்ணஸ்பர்ஶமே தா^(₄)ரகம்). And how big are they? Well, if the carp is going to be the size of elephant calves, the cows are clearly going to be larger, right? Yes, they are as huge as Śatruñjaya, Rāma’s elephant! And I think Keshav (the artist whose sketch features above) captures that idea very accurately, as he always does.

And verse 7 describes the cowherd women’s activities: they make butter three times a day: the noise that the churning creates can be heard all the way up in Vaikuṇṭha, and is as sacred as the Vedic mantras of the Brahmins. And their silver chains and necklaces (that they prefer to gold ones) jingle as churning is a tough job that requires a lot of efforts from them for various reasons, not the least because the cows produce an infinite quantity of milk all day round: the thickness of the curds , the softness of their hands, and their faintness during Kṛṣṇa’s absence, and Kṛṣṇa’s getting in the way when He is present! Because of course, he doesn’t like curd to become butter, and therefore, pulls their arms away! *tayirai mōrākkavoṭṭēṉ,* He had declared!

And of course, the *Tiruppāvai* mentions all sorts of birds that chirp, cattle that graze and people who go about their daily business, and as Velukkudi Krishnan Swami points out, money or gold is not mentioned despite the prosperity of the hamlet. How else could it be, with Kṛṣṇa roaming around and spreading joy?
