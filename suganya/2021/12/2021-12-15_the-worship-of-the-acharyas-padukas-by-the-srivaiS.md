The worship of the Ācārya’s pādukās by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas

When we decided to have a workshop on [South Indian Vaiṣṇava material culture](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/11/21/workshop-announcement-vaiṣṇava-material-culture-in-south-india/), (which has just ended and which was so informative, and the exchange has been wonderful too!), I chose to focus on the worship of the *pādukā*s. I knew there were interesting things to say, but never imagined that there would be so many things to say (and perhaps even more that I’m not aware of yet). So many nuances to grasp! Also, I didn’t expect any major difficulties in finding information, but I was initially wrong about that too. Some people wondered why bother? Why not talk about the *Pādukāsahasram* instead? I took note of course, I should also talk about this magnum opus, but perhaps on a different occasion. Some people were reluctant to divulge information, either because they thought they didn’t know enough on the topic, and others, because some things are not to be revealed publicly.

Thankfully for me, however, there were a handful of people who were more than forthcoming with information. And such a rich tradition it is, with such fascinating rites and deep meanings! I can’t say that I have grasped everything that I have been told, nor that I detain all the information that there is to know. But at least it’s a beginning. If at all any of you can add to it, whether it’s an extra piece of information, or an anecdote, a or anything useful/interesting, or a book/article to suggest, please do.

So the long and short of it is that the Ācārya’s *pādukā*s have a special place in the worship of the Śrīvaiṣṇava disciple. This is an ancient enough practice, and quite prevalent, although different people do it in a slightly different way, due to the *kalai* difference, or that of their own *maṭha/āśrama* differences. The frequency of their worship as well as that of the consumption of the water collected from washing them (*śrīpādatīrtham*) can vary, for example. The worship itself is simple enough, although a certain set of conditions are involved. If you’re curious to know more about this topic, here’s the video that I have uploaded on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxtbQ1dYx2rZ_0_NzpLWAVA), which I have made public for a while (I will probably go back to more private settings soon). Oh, do remember to drop me a line to tell me anything of interest concerning the topic! Thanks!
