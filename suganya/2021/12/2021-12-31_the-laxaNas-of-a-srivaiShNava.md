The lakṣaṇas of a Śrīvaiṣṇava

As the month of Mārkaḻi progresses, so does Velukkudi Krishnan Swami’s *Tiruppāvai* *kālakṣepam* based on Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Perumāḷ Nāyaṉār’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi* commentary (which seems to get lengthier for every verse, going against the general trends of the *vyākhyātā*s, who are more elaborate at the beginning, and grow progressively succinct). This commentary is giving very deep insights, although my back is not too happy about sitting without budging for approximately two hours per session. Ah well, *kuch pānā hai toh kuch khonā hi paḍtā hai…* Anyway, I found the commentary on verse 15 (*ellē iḷaṅkiḷiyē*) yesterday very interesting. Let’s see why.

To begin with, Nāyaṉār states that it is this song that is *Tiruppāvai*! திருப்பாவையாகிறது இப்பாட்டிறே! And apparently that’s because it teaches the Bhāgavatas how to conduct themselves and what to (and what is good for them), just as verse 29 teaches Bhagavān what to do. There are many such lists of things that Vaiṣṇavas ought to do or be like, like Narsi Mehta’s wonderful *vaiṣnava jana to*. So what does Nāyaṉār say on this topic?

Well, some of the ideas are found throughout the commentary on this verse, and for the sake of convenience, he also recapitulates the main points at the end, which is what I’m going to focus on:

1.  the words of those who have a taste for Bhagavān are *uddeśyam* (as
    shown by the words எல்லே இளங்கிளியே) 2.  if one gets to be with fellow Bhāgavatas, one should not stay away
    from that company for whatever reason (இன்னம் உறங்குதியோ)
    (ஶ்ரீவைஷ்ணவகோஷ்டியிலே புகுருகை ஏற்றம்) 3.  One ought to tolerate anything unpleasant coming from people who
    love Bhagavān, especially since they mean well (சில்லென்றழையேன்மின்) 4.  Even if some such unpleasant words are blurted out in haste, they
    should still be addressed respectfully (நங்கைமீர் போதற்கின்றேன்) 5.  One ought to accept the other’s faults, and not countersay
    excessively people who are worthy of respect (வல்லீர்கள் நீங்களே நானேதான்
    ஆயிடுக) – this is an important point, so here are Nāyaṉār’s exact
    words: பரதோ₃ஷத்தையும் ஸ்வதோ₃ஷமாக்கிக் கொள்ளவும், கௌ₃ரவ்யரை அதிநிர்ப₃ந்தம்
    பண்ணக்கடவதல்லவென்னுமிடத்தையும் சொல்கிலுறது. 6.  Close contact with the Bhāgavatas is vital for living (ஒல்லை நீ போதாய்) 7.  One should not live differently from the instructions of the
    predecessors (உனக்கென்ன வேறுடையை) 8.  All the Śrīvaiṣṇavas are *uddeśyar* and even if one of them is
    missing, it produces a certain lack in the enjoyment of God (எல்லாரும்
    போந்தாரோ போந்தெண்ணிக்கொள்): ஶ்ரீவைஷ்ணவர்களெல்லாரும் உத்₃தே₃ஶ்யரென்கிறது; ஒருவர்
    குறைந்தாலும் ப₄க₃வத₃நுப₄வத்துக்கு குறையென்கிறது (My thought: so much for
    trying to visit temples after ascertaining they won’t be too
    crowded!) 9.  The *ujjīvana* (however you translate it!) for the Bhāgavatas is the
    enjoyment of *bhagavadviṣayam* (வல்லானைக் கொன்றானை)

And perhaps the most poignant thing that Nāyaṉār states (and it is so characteristic of him!) is that if one approaches Bhagavān leaving aside the Bhāgavata, then it will be no different from worshipping some other deity! வைஷ்ணவவிஷயத்தை ப₃ஹிஷ்கரித்து பற்றும் ப₄க₃வத்₃விஷயத்தோடு தே₃வதாந்தரத்தோடு வாசியில்லை!

Anyway, this post is just for jotting down such interesting and important ideas. So I’m not really giving any further thoughts than that. These ideas should sink in for the reflections on them to ripen.
