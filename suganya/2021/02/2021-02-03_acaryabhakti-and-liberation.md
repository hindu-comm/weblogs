Ācāryabhakti and liberation

As it is Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ’s 650th birthday this year, the University of Madras and the Alumni Association of Vaishnavism organized a conference on this Ācārya. AndI chose to give a talk on his*Upatēcarattiṉamālai*, a fascinating poem with simple, memorizable verses, but which contains deep theological ideas. And the influence of Piḷḷai Lokācārya (among other Ācāryas) is unmissable. And one such important topic in which he follows in the footsteps of the other Ācārya is the role of the Ācārya in one gaining liberation. Māmuṉikaḷfinds this to be such an important topic that he dedicates two consecutive verses to roughly convey the same idea:

So, no love for the Ācārya’s feet means no Vaikuṇṭha, as simple as that. For, nothing else matters, not even devotion for God.Andthe opposite holds true: if you seek a proper Ācārya, Nārāyaṇa will give Vaikuṇṭha:

These two verses (60 & 61) placed next to each other somehow reminded me of the*anvaya-vyatireka*pattern. Anyway, this verse affirms thatseeking a proper Ācārya is sufficient cause for Nārāyaṇa to come forward and grant Vaikuṇṭha without anyone asking for anything, apparently. So we can see from this that forMāmuṉikaḷ,a proper Ācārya is not just a*puruṣakāra*(a mediator), but seems much more than that, a direct means for liberation. Which echoes Piḷḷai Lokācārya’s ideas in his*Śrīvacanabhūṣaṇam*for example.

You can read the poem with Piḷḷai Lokam Jīyar’s commentary [here](http://acharya.org/bk/pb/plj/urmv.pdf) and with PBA Swami’s commentary [here](http://acharya.org/bk/pb/pba/urmu.pdf).
