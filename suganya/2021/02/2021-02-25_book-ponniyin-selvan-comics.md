[Book] Ponniyin Selvan comics

Kalki Krishnamurthy’s *[Poṉṉiyiṉ Celvaṉ](https://archive.org/details/PonniyinSelvanFull)* is my favourite novel in Tamil. Actually, it has a fan following just like Jane Austen’s novels do. There still are people who have chat groups dedicated to it, and those who visit together with like-minded people the places mentioned in the historical novel. This post is especially for those who are fellow enthusiasts of Ponniyin Selvan.

A little background (mostly based on Wikipedia and completed with my own knowledge of the novel): * Ponniyin Selvan* was first serialised in the weekly editions of the magazine *Kalki* from 1950 to 1954, and was published in book form in 1955. It has since been published many times over. The original one was In five volumes, with roughly 2210 pages. The novel narrates the story of early days of Prince Aruṇmoḻittēvaṉ, who would later become one of the great Cōḻa king, Rājarāja I, who built the Bṛhadīśvara Temple in Tanjavur.

As I mentioned earlier, Ponniyin Selvan is loved by many, and Wikipedia states that the magazine in which it was serialised saw its circulation reach 71,366 copies in the 1950s, which is no mean feat to achieve in the young country.And the lockdown last year got more people read (or re-read) and discuss it, as if it was a newly published book. While Kamil Zvelebil doesn’t see much of Kalki’s writing (and I think the scholar sometimes thinks the world of himself), I think that it gave people a sense of self-respect, pride in their culture and their ancestors at a time when their colonial masters had all but persuaded them that they were barely civilised and that it was the white man’s burden to do so. It must have been something to hang on to during the tough post-war times.

Many people tried to turn the novel into a film, but it didn’t quite work out (Kamal Hassan tried, and so did Maniratnam (who was to have an impressive star cast, with Asihwarya Rai playing the role of the antiheroine Nandini), and apparently MGR himself before them). There’s a webseries, but I was enchanted when I learnt this morning (four years after it was published) of the existence of a comics version! Published by [Nila comics](https://nilacomics.com), the illustrations are by M. Karthikeyan, and I find them enchanting!

The portrayal of life under the Cō*ḻ*as looks nice

Vantiyattēva*ṉ* looks rather silly, but then, he is a little silly

But Kuntavai does look gracious

Nandini doesn’t look impressive though…

Very simple sketches, but I find them very nice

Eye-candy! Kuntavai and her friends. Karthikeyan was definitely inspired by the Cō*ḻ*a paintings by the look of it (please note their postures)

And my favourite now, *Aḻvāṛkkaṭiyāṉ,* a militant Śrīvaiṣṇava and a spy

I don’t yet know how many volumes there are. It seems we could get either the Tamil or the English version. I need to figure that out.
