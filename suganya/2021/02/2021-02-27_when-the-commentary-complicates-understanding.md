When the commentary complicates understanding

One of my favourite commentaries is the *Paṉṉīrāyirappaṭi vyākhyāna* on the *Tiruvāymoḻi* by Vādikesari Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Jīyar (14th c.). What’s so special about it, especially there are 4 other *vyākhyāna*s on the Nammāḻvār’s magnum opus? Well, I think that while the other commentators mostly thought that the Tamil verses of *Tiruvāymoḻi* are straightforward when it comes to “superficial” interpretation, and that the *vyākhyāna* is required to bring out the work’s inner meanings. But Vādikesari, probably because he belonged to a later period of time, or because he was said to be simpleton as a student, does not take the apparently simple Tamil of the *Tiruvāymoḻi* for granted. Therefore, he produced a commentary in which he gives word-by-word meanings, which is very useful for us in the 21st century.

A couple of words on Vādikesari: he studied under Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, and then later, under his son Nāyaṉār Āccāṉ Piḷḷai. And as said earlier, he is said to have been not too good at studies, and was assigned work in the kitchen. Once, when he heard his co-disciples discuss something interesting, he asked what it was about. And they derided him by saying that they were debating on *musalakisalaya* (‘sprouts from a wooden pestle’). Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai hears about it and decides to turn the simpleton into a scholar. And the rest, as they say, is history. Oral traditions claim that Vādikesari even wrote a work called *Musalakisalayam* later on.

Sometimes, he seems to make the understanding of a simple Tamil word a lot more complicated than it needs to be. For example, he glosses *vaṭamoḻi* (“the northern language”) as *saṃskṛta-bhāṣai* and “tamiḻ” as *drāviḍa-bhāśai*(‘the Dravidian/Tamil language’). My first thought was, ‘Who doesn’t know that “Northern language” is a reference to Sanskrit? Why explain what Tamil means to fellow Tamils?’ While discussing the topic during a Tamil Studies Conference (in Memory of Chelva Kanaganayakam) in Toronto, Anne Monius pointed out that the Prakrit languages could also be northern languages. So Vādikesari was making sure that there were no such misunderstanding when he glosses it as *saṃskṛta*. And I’m still trying to figure out why *drāviḍabhāṣai* for Tamil? Well, maybe because it’s the Dravidian language as opposed to Sanskrit. Mmm. Would that make some kind of Prakrit?

Another example: Vādikesari glosses *vicumpu eri vali nīr nilam* (‘sky, fire, wind, water, earth’) as *ākāśamum, agniyum, vāyuvum, jalamum, bhūmiyum*, all of them Sanskrit words. Why did he do that? Could he not find easier Tamil words to gloss them? Well, the idea must be to show that the *Tiruvāymoḻi* has parallels with the Upaniṣads, being the *Drāviḍaveda*. Think, for example, *ākāśāt vāyuḥ, vāyor agniḥ*, etc. from the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad.*

So, maybe Vādikesari wasn’t too different from his predecessors either, in that he doesn’t think the Tamil verses too difficult to understand. But still, I find his glosses very helpful to understand the *Tiruvāymoḻi* verses. But then, I find a commentary invariably useful, if we know how to use it.
