[Book] “Life and Works of Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya” (first Indian epigraphist & a descendant of Appayya Dīkṣita)

A couple of weeks ago, a lady called Sunitha Madhavan emailed me about the biography that she wrote of her great grand-father, Venkayya (1864-1912), who she said deciphered many temple inscriptions, including one of the Śrīraṅgam inscriptions belonging to the reign of Kulottuṅga Cōḻa I (Gosh! it seems I’m getting an overdose of this guy, what with teaching the *Kaliṅkattu Paraṇi* this semester), which made a provision for singing Kulacēkara Āḻvār’s verses beginning with the words *tēṭṭarum tiṟal*. This is one of the very few inscriptions that help us narrow down the dates of the Āḻvār, and which I had used in [my book](https://www.academia.edu/39068941/My_Sapphire_hued_Lord_my_Beloved_Perumāḷ_Tirumoḻi_and_of_its_Medieval_Maṇipravāḷa_Commentary_by_Periyavāccāṉ_Piḷḷai_with_an_Introduction). It seems that he also deciphered a Sanskrit Inscription in Burma which quotes the *Mukundamālā*, and this is super fascinating too, although I do not believe the Āḻvār and the author of the Sanskrit poem to be one and the same.

Anyway, to get back to the email, the lady wished to send me a copy of the book, as she saw that I was an Indologist. She also added that Venkayya was a pioneer in Indian epigraphy and South Indian history, and that he was the Chief Epigraphist to the Government of India (1908-12), when John Marshall was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India. If this was not enough to whet my appetite, then surely the fact that Venkayya was a direct descendant of the eminent Appayya Dīkṣita (as is the author of this book) did it for me. Who would require a fee to eat sugarcane? as the Tamils say. I wrote back to her eagerly.

I received the book yesterday, and I have only managed to skim through it for the moment. To be honest I did not know of Venkayya before the email came, and I realise that so many brilliant (often unsung) scholars have contributed in so many ways to South Indian scholarship, and have enabled us to stand on their mighty shoulders, without us necessarily knowing whom to thank.

So, Venkayya learnt the Vedas from his father in his native village Velaiyathur (which I think is Vaḷaiyāttūr), and also read Tamil bhakti poetry. He then got Western education at a school in Chittoor, and then at the Madras Christian College, where he earned a degree. He accidentally met Hultzsch in Mahābalipuram, and the rest, as they say, is history. The much impressed German Indologist later hired him as his assistant. Venkayya seems to have written many articles, and deciphered the inscriptions of many temples (the list is long!), and also contributed to the *Epigraphica Indica*. He seems to have dedicated his life for his passion, and his research has helped write the history of the Cōḻas, and KA Nilakantha Sastri seems to have acknowledged his contributions.

Anyway, I need to read it further before I can say more on this book, which has been published by the Tamil Arts Academy (2020). The author inherited the diary, coin collections and so forth of Venkayya, and was advised by none other than R. Nagaswamy to write this biography as a tribute to a great scholar. So long as we remember that this was written by a non-professional, and someone who greatly admired her ancestor, this is a nice, informative read. A round or two of editing (especially copy-editing) would have been good, though.

This biography reminded me of U. Vē. Cāmiṉātaiyar’s autobiography, *[Eṉ Carittiram](https://www.tamildigitallibrary.in/book-detail.php?id=jZY9lup2kZl6TuXGlZQdjZt1lZUe&tag=என்%20சரித்திரம்#book1/)*, which I had enjoyed immensely, because both men seem to have experienced grinding poverty in their childhood, but persevered and reached great heights. As a matter of fact, the two seems to have been acquainted with each other, and corresponded with each other for many years. And the author is right in pointing out the two men were instrumental in the renaissance of Tamil.
