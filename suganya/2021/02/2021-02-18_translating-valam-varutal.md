Translating valam varutal – doing pradakṣīṇa

Working extensively on Tamil Vaiṣṇava texts, I’m often confronted with this expression, either because Kṛṣṇa walks *valam* (‘right’ -\> rightwards) when walking to the place where He is to marry Āṇṭāḷ, or because Āṇṭāḷ and Kṛṣṇa go around the fire (*tīvalam ceyya*) as part of the wedding rites (*Nācciyār Tirumoḻi*). Or *valam* is simply prefixed in words like *valampuri* conches, which curl to the right. And plenty more expressions that use it in everyday speech as well.

I have often wondered how to translate them, rather than explain or paraphrase them in a translation. I guess many people must have done so before me. *Pradakṣiṇa* is circumambulation, but it’s important to mention the direction of the movement. So should we have rightward circumambulation? I feel it is not quite enough . Clockwise is accurate, but then, Āṇṭāḷ and the Āḻvārs did not have clocks in their times, so how to use an anachronistic word?

Yesterday, as I was reading a cosy mystery called *[The Burning Issue of the Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42963079-the-burning-issue-of-the-day)* by T.E. Kinsey, and I learnt something that got me thinking on the above topic: two characters discuss the haggis (yikes!), and one of them explains that evolution has made the particular mountain sheep have shorter left legs, which allows them not to fall and move on the rocks with ease, but which also means that they can only move “widdershins”, i.e. anticlockwise. This adverb (and also adjective sometimes), also spelt as “withershins” is a Scottish one, which the OED defines as “In a direction contrary to the apparent course of the sun (considered unlucky or associated with occult rites); anticlockwise” (ORIGIN:Middle Low German*weddersin(ne)s*fromMiddle High German*widersinnes*, from*wider-*counter-(cf.witheradjective & adverb) + genit. of*sin*direction,way. InsenseA.2assoc. (throughScot. pronunc.) withsunnoun)).

I started looking for its antonym, and found deasil/deisal, also a Scottish usage, which means clockwise. Synonyms such as “sunwise” were also given. So could we say that Āṇṭāḷ and Kṛṣṇa circumambulate deasil? Or that devotees circumambulated the shrine sunwise? Wouldn’t that be fantastic? I have not exactly paid attention to how the word has been translated so far, but I shall keep an eye on it from now on. And the next time you read a verse that I have translated with deasil or sunwise, please don’t roll your eyes!
