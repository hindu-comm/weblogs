The names for Vaikuṇṭha

Vaikuṇṭha has many names, both in Sanskrit and in Tamil (not to mention the other languages): Ayodhyā (yes!), Aparājitā, Paramapada(m), Viṣṇulokam (and *viṇṇakaram*). While the Śrīvaiṣṇava traditions claim that the Ikṣvākus’ capital was named after the Supreme Abode, I somehow think that the epic must have used the name before. But then, I don’t really know, as I haven’t checked either the Rāmāyaṇa or older texts, at least not yet. Vaikuṇṭha is also called the Nityavibhūti (the eternal realm) by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas, as opposed to the Līlāvibhūti, which is Nārāyaṇa’s realm of play, i.e. our world here.

In Śrīvaiṣṇava texts, it is also referred to as தன்னடிச்சோதி (taṉṉaṭiccōti) and தன்னுடைச்சோதி (taṉṉuṭaiccōti). The former is split like this: *taṉ-ṉ-aṭi-c-cōti* = Final bliss, as the radiance of the feet of God (*Tamil Lexicon*). And for the latter, Santi Sadhana’s *Glossary of Tamil Vaishnava Prose* has an entry for தன்னுடையச்சோதி *taṉ-ṉ-uṭaiya-c-cōti* = His *jyotis*. These names must be a reference to the facts that Vaikuṇṭha is His feet, and the place is self-luminous (*svayaṃprakāśa*).

And then today, while reading the *Periya tirumuṭi aṭaivu*, a hagiographic text of the 15th-16th c., which I find interesting for more than a reason, and which I have started translating, I have come across *pañcopaniṣaṇmaya*, which is literally something like “made of/consisting of the five upaniṣads”. Now what does that mean? The *Glossary of Tamil Vaishnava Prose* defines it as *aintu rahasyamantraṅkaḷukkup poruḷāṉavaṉ* “He who is the meaning/essence of the five esoteric mantras”, and gives a quotation from the *Vārttāmālai.* Neither helps.

I turned to Google, and a book called *Moksha in the Visishtadvaita Philosophy* by R. Parthasarathy (2016: 215) lists *panchopanishadmaya* among other names of Vaikuṇṭha, and explains it as “the five panchopanishad mantra indicate this universe”, which does not help either. Anyone has any idea? Is this really a reference to the Upaniṣads? Or do we take it more literally? What are the five secret mantras then? I know of the three that are sacred to the Śrīvaiṣṇavas, but five? I guess this is the beginning of a quest, where the more I dig, the more interesting things I will find.
