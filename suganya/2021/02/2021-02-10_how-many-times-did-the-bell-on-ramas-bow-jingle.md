How many times did the bell on Rāma’s bow jingle?

While reading the *Kaliṅkattu Paraṇi* yesterday, I was more than once annoyed by the exaggerated praise offered to Kulottuṅga, and made me wonder how someone could accept to have such sycophants around them. That would be terribly dangerous, especially for a king. I didn’t go very far into the chapter called “Avatāram”, which of course, the poet (or a later editor) thought an appropriate title for a part that describes the king’s birth and so on. But what I read was enough to give me an idea of what is to follow:

Now, it’s perfectly fine for a child to prattle (if this one really did prattle, which it probably didn’t), but to make a poem of praise out of that… Ah well, I guess the poet had a living to make, and probably even a head to save. Another verse speaks of an uninterrupted shower of arrows:

This reminded me of many things. First of all, exaggerated praise is not new to literature. And secondly, the mention of showers of arrows are simply there everywhere. Arjuna and Rāma, for example, are said to be such great archers as to produce them at will, without making much of an effort. In this context, I was reminded of a verse by Kampaṉ (whom Cayamkoṇṭār clearly knew well) that I was introduced to in a lecture on Kampa Rāmāyaṇam by Velukkudi Krishnan. Hold your breath and read this:

This verse roughly means that a *kavantam* (\<*kabandha*), or a headless creature, rises and dances when a thousand elephants, ten thousand chariots, one crore of horses, and a thousand soldiers are killed. And when a thousand *kavantam*s dance, then the bell tied to Rāma’s bow would jingle once. And when Rāma was fighting off the Rākṣasas, that bell jingled non-stop for 7,5 *nāḻikai*s (=*nāḍikā*s), which is roughly for 24 minutes X 7,5 = 3.3 hours!

Somehow I find it easier to accept hyperbole when it’s meant to praise a divine being. But then, Kulottuṅgaṉ is also seen as an incarnation of Viṣṇu. Oh please!
