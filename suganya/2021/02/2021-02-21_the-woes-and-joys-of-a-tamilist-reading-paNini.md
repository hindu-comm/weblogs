The woes and joys of a Tamilist reading Pāṇini

This post is entirely about my personal experience and impressions, which may not interest most people. But I felt I had to write them down as it might interest fellow Tamils and (non-Sanskritist) Tamilists, and be useful to them if they feel like taking on Pāṇini.

When the [Vyoma Saṃkṛta Pāṭhaśālā](https://www.sanskritfromhome.in) offered [a beginner’s course](https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/course/laghu_siddhanta_kaumudi_part_1/) to read the *[Laghusiddhāntakaumudī](https://www.onlinesanskritbooks.com/2019/01/laghu-siddhanta-kaunudi-geeta-pres.html)* , I decided to jump into the bandwagon, and see if the traditional method of learning grammar (and much more than that) could help me tame the beast that is Sanskrit (well, one can always dream, no?) For those who don’t know, Varadarāja’s LSK is a shorter version of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita’s *[Siddhāntakaumudī](https://web.archive.org/web/20110221095935/http://sanskritebooks.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/siddhanta-kaumudi-sanskrit-english-commentary-saradaranjan-ray-kumudranjan-ray/)* (17th c.), which is a commentary on the *[Aṣṭādhyāyi](https://archive.org/details/TheAshtadhyayiOfPanini-RamNathSharma)* that re-arranges the *sūtra*s so that there is a certain logical progression that helps learning.

So I sat for an exam set for those who wish to attend the classes live, and have been attending them for the past six months. The teacher, [Dr. Sowmya Krishnapur](https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/sowmya-krishnapur/), is a marvel. Her patience has got to be seen to be believed. And listening to her for half a minute is enough to perceive how knowledgeable and passionate she is about *vyākaraṇa*. So no wonder she has attracted over 1000 students for this online class. The challenge, though, for someone who dislikes grammar and the like is that… well, it’s grammar, and what’s more (worse?), it’s taught in Sanskrit (“Śāstras should be taught in Sanskrit”). If your mind goes woolgathering for a fraction of a second, then that’s it. Unless she repeats what she said, which she thankfully does often.

The *Māheśvarasūtra*s that we learnt right at the beginning were totally fascinating, both because these sounds are weird, and because we could see genius at work. I remember learning them by heart and reciting them to my dog, whose big eyes expressed worry and concern. And that feeling of awe has persisted till now. And for the first time in my life, I found grammar thoroughly enchanting. All was fine till the first exam was announced. And then I had to look for help, as I hadn’t taken any notes, and the idea of an exam made me forget everything I had understood and learnt. Thankfully, I was directed towards [Medha Michika’s English translations](https://arshaavinash.in/index.php/download/study-guide-to-laghu-siddhantakaumudi-part-1/) and explanations. Super useful. But then came the weeks when Tamil wholly got my attention, so even attending the classes and reading Michika’s books couldn’t help as much as they would have done if I had some time to sit and focus and gather my thoughts and absorb what I learnt.

But then, the number of things (as the sūtras in the sandhi prakaraṇam) I had to learn by heart started challenging my learning process. And with the next exam looming up (which always has questions from previous chapters), I started looking for help in Tamil, and found [this precious website](http://www.sangatham.com/laghu-siddhanta-kaumudi/samjna-prakarana-intro), which explained the initial *prakaraṇa*s in a very clear way. A lifesaver! Surprising how one’s mother tongue comforts one in times of despair. 

So, thanks to these crutches provided by many kind-natured souls, I’m reading Pāṇini, and although we have read only around 50 *sūtra*s in the last six months and it has taken a lot of my energy, I still feel that it is absolutely worth it, and I will continue to plod on happily. And I really wish someone would do the same for the *Tolkkāppiyam*. I guess it’s time to set up something like this online *pāṭhaśālā* for learning classical Tamil, grammar and all.
