The journey towards Vaikuṇṭha

While looking for some papers, I bumped into this magnificent picture that I bought in Śrīraṅgam a few years ago. It’s roughly 50cm X 30cm, possibly a copy of an older, bigger print. I find the fortuitous reappearing of this picture opportune, as I’m working on the journey to Vaikuṇṭha for a couple of papers, which is what this image represents.

If you look at the bottom left, the beginning of the journey to Vaikuṇṭha begins quite early in life (and this is a Teṉkalai depiction): *satsaṅgam* – good company, which leads *prapatti* (surrender), then *dehāvasānam* (the end of the body), and then the whole *arcirādi* path is depicted. The soul goes to *arcis* (Agni), and from there to further worlds, where he (the soul) is received by the appropriate deities. I always imagined the journey to be on foot, but apparently, the liberated soul gets a chariot to take him around.

This journey is described in many texts, which map the whole path, and the Sanskrit text (in Tamil script) above this depiction precisely describes it. Many texts in Manipravalam also mention this expedition, including the *Īṭu Bhagavadviṣayam*, and Vedānta Deśika’s *Rahasyatrayasāram* 21. Above the red images, we see the soul get down from his chariot, touched by Amānava, appointed to receive and guide the jīvātmā. He then dips in the Virajā river and steps into the immortal world. Happy to that there are hamsas that live on the Virajā…

But the process doesn’t end here, as the jivā climbs another chariot and is taken in procession, while he is received by Nityasūris. Nammāḻvār’s words *vaikuntam pukuvatu maṇṇavar vitiyē* is printed right at the entrance to Vaikuṇṭha, which has Jaya and Vijaya guarding the gates, as they do in a temple, and then Caṇḍa and Pracaṇḍa. The jīva is then made to circumambulate sunwise the *divyanagara*, before he enters it. It seems that he gets to meet Nammāḻvār on the way (top right).

There’s plenty more to describe here, but here are a couple of other things that I observed: the entrance leads to *tirumāmaṇi maṇḍapam* where Nārāyaṇa sits in state with Śrī, Bhū and Nīḷā upon Ananta, the ultimate destination for the jīvā. Bits of Nammāḻvār’s verses have been printed on the throne (*dharmādipīṭham*), especially *taṉakkēyāka eṉaikkoḷḷum ītē* – in which the soul, in the words of Nammāḻvār, requests Nārāyana to take him for Himself. This alludes to service, *kaiṅkarya*, which the *mumukṣu* hopes to get to do forever once he reaches that place, not for his own joy, but solely for His pleasure.

Projecting oneself on this path is one of the daily requirements for a Śrīvaiṣṇava desirous of liberation. So I guess such depictions were made to help such a contemplation. I’m sure that temple walls bear such images. Has anyone seen them? Maybe sculptures, too?

This is of course reminiscent of the board game that we play during Vaikuṇṭha Ekādaśī, the *paramapadasopānam* – based on luck, of course, avoiding the snake and climbing up the ladders, and finally reaching the Supreme Abode.
