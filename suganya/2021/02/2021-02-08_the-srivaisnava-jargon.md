The Śrīvaiṣṇava jargon

The other day, while reading the *Guruparamparāprabhāvam* in group, I realised that most people involved in the reading session hadn’t been aware of such a thing called “Śrīvaiṣṇava paribhāṣai”, or the jargon that the Śrīvaiṣṇavas use to communicate even in everyday language. Of course, its existence is hard to spot if you don’t interact with people in Tamil. And these are super important terms and expressions if we are reading Śrīvaiṣṇava works, especially the hagiographic ones.

Now, the words and expressions of the jargon can be heard in the temples run by the Śrīvaiṣṇavas: the deities receive a *tirumañjaṉam* (\< *majjana*) “bathing”, rather than an *abhiṣekam* (a more common word in non-Śrīvaiṣṇava temples); sweeping the place becomes *alakiṭutal*; tulsi leaves become *tiruttuḻāy*, Lakśmī is called *tāyār* (‘mother’), and so forth. Oftentimes, the word that is preferred over other options is Tamil. Actually, the kind of Tamil that has mostly not survived outside the sphere.

Food items, of course, get a lot of importance: cooking becomes *taḷikai*, “rasam” becomes *cāttamutu* and “pāyasam” becomes *tirukkaṇṇamutu*. Prominent characters from the *Rāmāyaṇa* (and also the Pūrvācaryas) get Tamil appellations (mostly, but not just): Jaṭāyu is referred to as Periya Uṭaiyār; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa become Perumāḷ and Iḷaiyaperumāḷ (which, incidentally, is Rāmānuja’s *pūrvāśrama* name, according to the traditions). Similarly, “Āḻvār” used outside a specific context is Nammāḻvār; Rāmānuja becomes Svāmi Emperumāṉār, and Periya Jīyar is Maṃavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ.

Also, words expressing humility abound: a person refers to him/herself as *aṭiyēṉ* ‘I, a slave’ (by no means a new practice, nor is it restricted to the Vaiṣṇava world); one’s house, however luxurious, is called a *kuṭicai* ‘hut’, and the other person’s place, a *māḷikai* (‘mansion’), even if it’s only a hut. An Ācārya is such a special person that he does not “sleep” (*tūṅku*) but *kaṇvaḷarntarukiṟār.* Also, when he is ill, he actually has adorned himself with disease (*nōvuc cāttik koṇṭār*). And so on.

I have this book in my possession, which I bought many years ago and which classifies the words in these categories:

I guess you can buy it (not sure if it’s an ebook though) from [here](https://www.instamojo.com/srivaishnavasri/sri-vaishnava-paribasha-paribhaashaa-paribaa/?ref=store). I remember a colleague at work (a few years ago) asking me curiously if I was actually reading about “Bathing terminology”… Anyway, this book also has the entry words transliterated into Hindi, along with a Hindi definition. This is meant to help all the non-Tamil speaking Śrīvaiṣṇavas, who lives across the subcontinent, and beyond.

While looking for further references, I bumped into [this blog](https://tamilandvedas.com/tag/வைஷ்ணவ-பரிபாஷை/), which mentions a 900+ pages book dealing with the topic, and which also gives samples from the book called *Vaiṣṇava paripāṣai* by a certain Empār Kaṇṇaṉ Rangarajan. I never knew of the book on the *paribhāṣai*, and Googling didn’t yield any results. So I directly wrote to the blogger, Ca. Nākarājaṉ, who promptly sent me the ebook within hours!

The book indeed runs into 900+ pages, 5500+ entries, and has also these categories above. It goes well beyond the usual words that one finds in the lists of Paribhāṣai words. It also gives meanings of philosophical terms, and ones that I have usually only found in written texts. It is indeed a treasure!
