The vēlaṉ, Aiṅkuṟunūṟu & sarcasm

We have been reading in class the *Aiṅkuṟunūru* for a semester now, and the relevance of some of its ideas and words even today surprises me all the time. We read verses 241 to 245 yesterday, in which the mother of a pining girl thinks that she is possessed, and calls in a *vēlaṉ* priest so that he can exorcise her. He seems to systematically declare that the girl is indeed possessed (by Muruku). The mother believes him, and the girl in love and her friend are the only ones who know the truth.

This brings us to verses like the following:

All we have here is a certain nervousness at being found out, which, actually wouldn’t be such a bad thing after all, as this would enable the girl to get married to her beloved when her affair comes to light. But in the following verse, she and her friend realise that the Vēlaṉ got his diagnosis wrong:

So the girl is surprised, or even sad, that the mother buys what the “ignorant” diviner claims. Still no hint of sarcasm. Maybe just a little. But in the next one, she wonders about the use of the ritual itself, if it’s not going to help the priest figure out the truth at all.

So if the priest does not guess the cause of her “disease / possession”, which actually is the “worthy man from the land of cool groves…”, the ritual to find out the truth is totally useless. Do we get a hint of religious / social criticism here? The next verse is where I really wonder if the girl is being positively sarcastic:

This verse was not easy to understand in the first place, but this is the rough meaning that we agreed upon. The girl points out that the Vēlaṉ must be an experienced one (he is old), and belongs to a village which has a long tradition of diagnosing properly cases of possession. Is the girl here surprised that such being the case, the priest totally failed to discover the real problem? Or is she being sarcastic about the whole tradition, as well as the priest who represents it, probably thinking of all the times that he must have got his guesses wrong? Looking at the last part of the sentence makes one wonder: she may have the same symptoms of someone who is possessed, but does the man she loves have the same traits as Muruku who is supposed to torment her?

Could the girls here be laughing at the whole tradition, because they know better? Do they feel sorry for the Vēlaṉ because he gets it all wrong? Or do they imply that he has been earning a living by bluffing?
