The five manifestations of Viṣṇu

We were reading the following verse from the *Periyāḻvār Tirumoḻi*, and a question popped up in mind, which had been disturbing me for a while now:

I was trying to explain that the first line may be a reference to Viṣṇu being accessible to the gods in the Milk Ocean, which corresponds to the *vyūha* form out of the five manifestations mentioned in some Pāñcarātric texts. The second reference to Him as the dweller in the hearts of people could be an allusion to the *antaryāmi* form; I guess the Husband of Śrī could be any of the forms. Not too sure. And as it is Periyāḻvār who speaks using Yaśodā’s voice (although she seems to know more about Kṛṣṇa’s real nature than she is supposed to here), we can also find here a reference to His *vibhava* form (‘avatāra’).

Now, what about this child lying on a banyan leaf, having swallowed all the worlds during the pralaya (and which spits out the whole thing when It wants to begin creation again)? The Āḻvārs mention it all the time, and I think the *Bhāgavatapurāṇa* also tells the story of when the ascetic Mārkaṇḍeya was allowed to watch what was inside the belly of the Vaṭapatraśāyin once (see featured image). and the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas ask humorous questions to Him, like, how come a banyan leaf survived when everything went inside Your belly? How was a banyan leaf big enough to bear You, especially when You had swallowed everything? And so forth.

My question is about this form, and it is purely out of ignorance (or sheer forgetfulness). Does this correspond any of the five forms (*pañcaprakāra*) of Nārāyaṇa? If so, I’d bet we can narrow down the choice to *para* and *vyūha*. Is that an extension of His *para*-bis form, as He came down from Vaikuṇṭha to deal with the business of dissolution and new creation, when no one else was around anymore? Or is that a *vyūha*-bis form, as Nārāyaṇa in the *para* manifestation would not deal with this all? Anyone knows? If so, could you suggest where I could read up about it? Or maybe it is from a different stream and has nothing to do with the *pañcaprakāra* at all?

Notes: I found the image from [here](http://www.harekrsna.de/krishna-banyan-leaf.htm), where there is a nice write-up on the Vaṭapatraśāyin.
