The influential verses by Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār

Sometimes, theologians slightly adapt their views according to their audience, because how you talk to your friend is not necessarily how you address your business rival. And the audience can be carefully chosen by opting for one language over another. It has even been noted that Vedānta Deśika, for example, presents slightly different views on key topics even across genres. So, in order to know what Rāmānuja personally thought on certain fundamental issues (which may have been different from what he said in his *Śrībhāṣyam*, for example), it is essential to know what he wrote in Tamil.

Except that, he didn’t… Or, let’s put it this way: a few *taṉiyaṉ* verses have been attributed to him (and I don’t see why he couldn’t have written them, although there’s no proving or disproving the authorship one way or another; and you can read more about *taṉiyaṉ*s in general [here](https://www.academia.edu/44761519/The_Taṉiyaṉ_Its_Role_Evolution_and_Importance_in_the_Śrīvaiṣṇava_Tradition)), but nothing else in Tamil. So how do we know what he thought when he was home? Erin and I agreed that examining his immediate disciples’ works could provide a clue, especially if they have written in Tamil, which they thankfully have. Everyone knows Tiruvaraṅkatt’ Amutaṉār’s *Irāmānuca Nūṟṟantāti*, and Tirukkurukai Pirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi* commentary in Tamil Manipravala, but there is also the less known Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār’s twin poems, the *Jñānasāram-Prameyasāram*. We have therefore been working on translating these works, because we are very certain that Rāmānuja’s disciples will definitely be found to be his spokespersons.

Aruḷāḷar is said to have been an Advaitin from Andhra, called Yajñamūrti, who was “converted” by Rāmānuja, after an 18-day debate. The hagiographic texts claim that Rāmānuja started losing the upper hand by the 17th day, but acquired victory after he dreamed of Kanchi Peraruḷāḷaṉ (Varadarāja) who suggested that he use Yāmnunācārya’s argument against the Māyāvādins. Which is why he was named after that Deity, plus Rāmānuja’s own title (Emperumāṉār). He was known for his devotion to Rāmānuja: he once destroyed his *maṭha* and went to live under Rāmānuja’s roof, as some people got confused about the two Emperumāṉārs and their *maṭha*s. Now about Aruḷāḷar’s *Jñānasāram-Prameyasāram*. I’m polishing the translating of his 50 Tamil verses, for publishing them along with an article that I need to have written before the end of the year.

It’s a highly important work for Viśīṣṭādvaita, a veritable trailblazer, as it contains all the germs for the ideas that will be expressed in an expansive way by the Ācāryas of the following generations, especially Piḷḷai Lokācārya. Some verses find their echoes in his *Śrīvacanabhūṣaṇam*. Which is why even Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ has composed a commentary on it. So it’s a surprise that not many academics thought to look into in detail this crucial link between Rāmānuja and the later Ācāryas.

Here’s a verse that I enjoyed much:

The importance of the Ācārya is expressed in such a simple way: useless, foolish even, to run after God, when you have an Ācārya. There are a couple of rendering of sorts into English of these twin-poems, but no proper translation, which is why I’m working on one, savouring each verse in the process. I hope that it is useful for fellow theologians.
