[Video] Was Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār derailed by a woman?

A couple of months ago, Swamiji discussed about how people associate in their minds Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār with a courtesan, who supposedly led him astray as part of her challenge, and suggested that something ought to be done about this. The first step, of course, was to check the Āḻvār’s poetry to see what he says (and what he does not). And then of course, most things we think we know about the Āḻvārs come from the Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographic works. So Swamiji suggested that I give a two-part lecture. The following corresponds to the first part which largely deals with Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi’s *Tirumālai,* which any hints as to who and what the Āḻvār was. (And once I get some free time, I’ll work on the second part).

The themes we find as we read through his poem are: the overwhelming importance that he grants to devotion (which consists in admiring His form as Raṅganātha, singing His names, etc.); his conviction that devotion is superior to caste distinction; his harsh words against the “Others”, and he can be quite virulent for someone who otherwise comes across as a soft person, who reserves the harshest words for himself; and then, he does mention the women especially as representatives of worldly pleasures. But is there enough to conclude that his criticism of women comes from a place of hurt? Is it not a common practice for saint-poets to make women an *upalakṣaṇa* for worldly pleasures and therefore, reviled as being temptresses who keep the *jīvātman* tied down to *saṃsāra*? Does that mean they speak from personal experience as hagiographic stories tell us?
