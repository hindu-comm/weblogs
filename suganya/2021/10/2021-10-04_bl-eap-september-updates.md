[BL-EAP] September updates on my BL project

This is an update on the work done within the framework of [my BL-EAP project](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/08/02/bl-eap-beginning-work-on-a-british-library-endangered-archives-programme-project/) that began in August. You can see the August updates [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2021/09/01/august-updates-on-my-bl-project/).

Work has continued with the usual ups and downs. Finding the right cataloguer has proved to be a challenge, especially one who knows how to read Grantha, who has cataloguing skills, who knows something about the material, and who has the time and enthusiasm to do it. I’ve had to pitch in, and I wish I had more time to spare for this kind of work.

Another unexpected thing that happened was that over 4L of lemon grass oil (at close to 2400 INR a litre!) for oiling the manuscripts that should have lasted the whole project got used in a month-and-a-half! Someone didn’t know that you don’t need to bathe the leaves in oil (which actually might make them to stick to each other!), and that the oil evaporates very fast… Lesson learnt for the next time!

And another challenge we faced (the last one I will tell you about, lest they bore you): after cleaning, the leaves in the manuscripts were apparently displaced unintentionally, and were digitised as they were! Once they were displaced, it was hard to put the leaves in their right place when the left edge (where the foliation is) is broken, or when a bundle is a multiple text manuscript with the foliation beginning anew for each work. Akane and Saravanan Sir are helping us to put thr leaves in the right order, and we are also progressively re-digitising them now.

Right, so what interesting manuscripts did we discover/catalogue/digitise? Well, many of them, especially from the Villiampākkam collection, give healing remedies and tips. Some of them deal with astrology. Sometimes mantras are recorded, with the accompanying drawings of yantras and symbols.

Hmm, I can’t decipher these, but clearly they are meant to attract all sorts of things…

We did find a Tamil dictionary, though, probably unpublished, but only from *a* to *ī*. It seems to have been composed by a certain *perumpākkam māṉiyār šrī ayyaṅkār, ṟeṅka ayyaṅkār* (some kind of a Srivaisnava brahmin landowner from Perumpākkam, a suburb of Chennai).

A look at the Akarāti

And there was also a Noṇṭi nāṭakam, one of the minor literary forms that came into existence in the 17th c. This one describes a thief who loses his leg in the process of stealing…

We found a colophon in one of them (a copy of the Sundarakanda) that gives the date the copying work was done:

> அக்ஷயவருஷம்அர்ப்பிசிமாஸம்8வெள்ளீகேஷமை72நஷிகைக்கியெழுததோங்கினதுவிழுப்புறம்அ > குப்புசாமிஅய்யங்கார்சுத்தலிகிதம்ஸுந்தரகாண்டம்-ஶ்ரீராமஜெயம்-உண்டாகவும்.

This corresponds to Friday 10^(th)of October, 1746!! But the same manuscript mentions the same Kuppucāmi Aiyaṅkār, and gives 1866 as the date. So it’s a little confusing. Was that a grandson? Is one the dates wrong (especially the older one)? Need to check all that!

As for the Kalliṭaikuṟicci collection, we have a nice copy of Vedārthasaṃgraha, an incomplete manuscript of Desika’s *Rahasyatrayasāra*, and a *Pādukāsahasram* with the graphical patterns of a *citrakāvya*:

But perhaps, the most exciting thing is that we may have found an unpublished manuscript, a copy of Vaidyanātha’s *Paribhāṣārthasaṃgraha*, probably a summary of the *Paribhāṣenduśekhara*! A couple of other copies exist in other libraries, but we think that it may not have been published yet. And someone is hoping to edit it 🙂

So there you go! 1/5th of the project time has gone, but everyday we are awaiting more colophons and unpublished, unheard of manuscripts with bated breath!
