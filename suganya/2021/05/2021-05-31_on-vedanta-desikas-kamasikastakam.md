On Vedānta Deśika’s Kāmāsikāṣṭakam

Last week, I gave a talk on this stotra by the master poet on Narasiṃha Jayantī, but it was a first of its kind for me, as it was a non-academic discourse given at a *satsaṅga*. Which meant that I had to curb my instincts to have a set of problematics, a structure around them, a literary study of the verses, and so on an so forth. After translating the verses with Andrey Klebanov’s help, I simply wrote down the extra explanations and anecdotes that came to my mind as I read through them. And the never-failing Velukkudi Krishnan Swami’s discourse on the Aṣṭakam gave some further ideas. And there the talk was ready.

Vedānta Deśīka dedicates this Aṣṭakam to Narasiṃha, the resident Deity of a place/temple-town called Tiruvēḷukkai, or Kāmāsikā in his Sanskrit translation. Unsurprisingly, his poetry is very special, with śleṣas, metaphors, vivid descriptions, etc. He even uses six different metres for this set of 8+1 verses. In these, Deśika gives a double portrait of the Man-Lion, as one who is in deep meditation with all His senses under total control (for which he uses terminology from aṣṭāṅga-yoga), and another, of one who hysterically tears a Rākṣasa apart. The description of that gruesome act is totally mind-blowing.

All these words are followed by a solemn declaration of unconditional surrender, by someone who knows that there is but little choice. I find these words strangely moving, like the words of a toddler entirely dependent on its parent for its everything. And I think that it is one of the best lines by Deśika (although, of course, I have remotely read them all!):

Here’s the recording of the talk, which is slightly over an hour long. Not sure I achieved my objective of presenting these verses clearly, if not in a simple way. But I had plenty of satisfaction working on the *Kāmāsikāṣṭakam*, which reinforced my belief that Deśika was a genius.
