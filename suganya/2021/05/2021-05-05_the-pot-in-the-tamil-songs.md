The pot in the Tamil songs

As I decided to get myself an earthen pot to beat the Agninakshatram heat this summer, I was reminded of a famous verse by a Cittar (Siddha) poet, called Kaṭuveḷ Cittar:

Here’s a nice rendering of the folk song by a Carnatic musician, Prince Rama Varma (the song starts at 5:20, before which he explains the meanings of the words, among other things, in Malayalam):

(Lovely, but it sounds too carnatic. A cinematic rendering which messes with the words, but in which the tune is more folk-like can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugD79tyLLSg)).

Anyway, to get back to the verse, it is supposed to have another layer of meaning: the potter is God, the mendicant is the jīvātmā/soul, and the pot is the body. So the soul requests for a body from God, gets one, prances about in life, and destroys it ultimately. I presume the flower garden is saṃsāra, although I really wouldn’t compare it with a flower-garden, personally… The Cittar are excellent at rendering deep ideas in apparently simple words. And they were so close to everyday life, that their words strike a chord immediately.

Another verse from Periyāḻvār (5.2.1) also came to my mind at this point:

Here, the Āḻvār, too, compares the body to a pot (and later on, to a city), especially one that contains the very attractive ghee, which has ants/diseases invading it. And as God takes residence in him (in his body? in his mind? in his heart?), protection is guaranteed. (By the way, the decade is traditionally recited by those who are ill, something that can be useful during these hard times, for those who believe in it).

I guess it must be an old topos to equate the body with the pot. I do remember reading other texts, including possibly ones in Sanskrit, where this is done. Maybe it’s those philosophical texts and their examples, which speak of the different causes (the potter is the nimittakāraṇa, the clay is the upādānakāraṇa, and the wheel / stick, etc. are the sahakārikāraṇa). So the potter seems to be associated with creation here, an idea that is echoed with the first verse above. And so very appropriate to choose the pot: it is made by someone, it can contain things, but it is fragile an invariably breaks. Like a human body.

Have you come across other interesting verses/ texts that use the metaphor of the pot? I love how the examples are down-to-earth, tied to the soil. Any other such objects from everyday life that has been interestingly used to make a point?
