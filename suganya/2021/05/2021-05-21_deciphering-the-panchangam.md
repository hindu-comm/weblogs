On trying to learn the deciphering of the Panchangam

While I was trying to enrol for an online course on the *Tarkasaṃgraha*, taught by [the Madras Sanskrit college](https://course.madrassanskritcollege.edu.in), I checked what other courses they offered. And the one that immediately caught my attention was [the one on Panchangam](https://course.madrassanskritcollege.edu.in/courses/பஞ்சாங்கம்-batch10/) caught my attention. I always was fascinated (and utterly bewildered) by this almanac, and the mysteries that its tables and tables of numbers hold. As a child, I just knew that it was bought at the beginning of the Tamil new year by mid-April, and then read on the first day, and then consulted once in a while, to know when a certain event happened (birth, death), or when a certain rite/other event had to be organised. There were, of course, different types (pāmpu \[‘snake’\] pañcāṅgam \[see image above\], gaurī pañcāṅgam, etc.).

So here was an opportunity to learn more, and after finishing over 70% of the class, here are some things I learnt on the topic, but also my opinions on the various aspects of the course. To begin with, it is taught in Tamil, which makes sense if the people who are interested are going to use the Tamil panchangam. Dr S. Murali, an assistant professor of Jyotisha at the institution, is the course teacher. The classes last a maximum of 20-25 minutes, sometimes much briefer than that. And after each lesson there’s a MCQ test, usually pretty easy.

Now to Panchangam itself: it has five limbs as its name suggests, *tithi, vāram, nakṣatram, yogam* and *karaṇam*. And for each of them, we are taught which of them to avoid in general – but not which of them to choose, because that apparently varies on the nature of the rite/event. This is understandable, but I do feel a little cheated, as this is an important aspect of learning to use the panchagam. The teacher goes to great lengths to repeat things he just said, so he could have used that time (since we can watch the video again any number of times for a year) to introduce other useful information. By the way, he is also excruciatingly slow, and there’s no option to change the speed of the video, which makes me feel rather jittery. Maybe they should give us the option. The charts they show on the screen are good, and because we can take screenshots, there’s no point in repeating more than necessary, or slowing down completely. Anyway.

As is common, we are also given mnemonic techniques to remember, for example, when the Rāhukālam occurs every day. Now this Rāhukālam is something that I try to avoid, call me superstitious if you want. So here goes the sentence whose first syllable corresponds to the first syllable of a particular day (in Tamil, of course): **தி**ருவிழாச் **ச**ந்தையில் **வெ**ளியே **பு**றப்பட்டு **வி**ளையாடச் **செ**ல்வது **ஞா**யமா? As the Rāhukālam lasts 90 minutes, at time between 6 am and 6pm, depending on the day, we just need to memorise this (or any other dozen sentences of the kind that exist). And then Bob’s your uncle!

A good thing is that the teacher doesn’t stop at explaining the Panchangam, but also other aspects (like the Rāhukālam above) that enter the arena while one decides to fix or avoid a day and time. And one thing I understood is that there’s rarely an hour which will be entirely auspicious, which is rather discouraging.

I think that now that I have learnt the basics, I could try and learn some more. Hopefully, someone else will offer another more advanced course and spare me the need to hunt down a book or two and learn from them. And while I will buy the Panchangam for its old-world charm, there are easier ways of using it in these times when www has all the solutions:

The above website lets you choose your exact location, and the exact time of sunrise, which is crucial. Happy to see that the almanac has survived through the ages, and will continue to do so, albeit in a different avatar!
