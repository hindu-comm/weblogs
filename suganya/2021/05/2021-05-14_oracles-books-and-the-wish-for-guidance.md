Oracles, books, and the wish for guidance

Human beings are curious about lies ahead in their lives. Those going through tough times are anxious to know if things will get better. And so many methods are used to achieve their end, like consulting an astrologer. Now, sometimes people want guidance, they want to know if they’re taking the right path or wish to know what oath is the right one. I believe this is slightly different from the previous case. And there must be many ways of trying to figure that out.

One of them is opening a certain book at a random page (after certain rituals, I believe), and whatever the words that greet their eyes are taken to be an answer to their query, a message from yonder. This seems to be widely popular, across countries and cultures. I have seen people pray at the tomb of Hafez in Isfahan, and open his book of poems at a random page.

I remember opening this, and getting a depressing message…

Some people do that with the Bhagavdgītå, I believe. And while looking for something else, I found that the practice was in a way systematised by Tulsidas Goswami, who produced the Rāmāgyaprasna, for the express purpose of consulting it in case of doubts concerning the future. According to hagiography, he did so to help an astrologer friend, who was asked by the king to divine if his son, the prince, was still I’ve, being lost in the forest. Tulsidas composed this overnight, and the astrologer’s head was thus saved from the king’s anger.

This book that I bumped into, and which bought because I simply can’t resist anything related to the Ramayana, is by David Frawley, who renders it into English. He also has a version with cards, like the Tarot ones, but my curiosity didn’t take me so far as to get them.

Tulsidas’s work is composed of seven chapters that tell the story of Rāma, with each having different sections, which are composed of verses in Awadhi, I believe, but I need to check that, and get the book with the original verses. Frawley adds a paragraph to help make sense of the not-so-obvious messages that lie hidden in them.

And of course, there are rules and regulations as to how to consult the work (the ones I found on the Internet tended to be more complicated than what Frawley suggests): pick a right day to ask permission of the work, ask the question on the following day, etc. And once the question is asked, there are many ways of finding the right verse, like placing the finger with closed eyes on the patterns.

Despite the experience with Hafez’s poetry, I wanted to give this one a try. But then I saw that one had better have a pertinent question. And I’m still thinking of one. A good thing then, to have got this book. It showed me that the questions and issues I think I have are just not worth the overthinking that I allot them.

Have you come across similar practices? Have you had an experience trying such a prasna,even if it’s for the fun of it? I wonder what’s the point of this post. Well, none, actually, except that I wanted to share this “discovery” of mine with people who might not know about it, as well as with those who know more than I do on the topic.
