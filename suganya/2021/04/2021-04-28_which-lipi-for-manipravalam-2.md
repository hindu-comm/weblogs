Which lipi for Manipravalam? ‚Äì 2

Vinodh and I have been working on the scripts that are used to transcribe ≈örƒ´vai·π£·πáava Manipravalam for some time now. And last week, we had to put together a paper for [a conference on scripts](https://www.ac.upd.edu.ph/index.php/resources/conferences/2489-scripts-asia-1500-2000-conference). So we opted to write a very basic paper that lists and briefly describes the different options that have been tried across one-and-a-half millennia. For the simple reason that no one seems to have done it before, and it would be super useful to quote even for our other articles (which we are working on).

So what we think is that 1) during the premodern period, a combination of (some form of) Grantha and Tamil was predominantly used, in inscriptions but also in palm-leaf manuscripts. Telugu may have also been used (possibly also Kannada), especially in the manuscripts (and I wonder whether this was a modern phenomenon inspired by the printed books); 2) during the colonial period and the arrival and spread of the printing press, other options were tried, including the traditional one described above, or Telugu replacing Grantha, or taking over the whole text including the Tamil bits; 3) in the late 20th c., other options were tried, including Tamil script with numerical diacritics or DevanƒÅgari; academics use the Latin script with diacritics, while the lay, non-Tamil reading people prefer the Latin with a different formatting. And so on and so forth.

Here is our talk, which is super short due to our being allowed only 15 minutes. Do let us know if you are aware of any other combinations, especially in the premodern and the colonial periods? Is there something important that we need to add (other than our hypotheses as to why a certain script or combination of scripts was tried, and whether or not that was/is a good solution that strikes a balance between accuracy and accessibility?). Any thoughts or suggestions?

PS: there are a couple of errors in some the things I say above, especially when I give the date of the beginning of colonisation as 1857 rather than 1858. A couple of other slips, but I guess you will survive üòâ

PS 2: the image above is from [this site](https://www.shopclues.com/ceylonmine-natural-red-coral-and-pearl-beads-mala-with-lab-certificate-gemstone-mala-for-unisex-147646242.html), from which you could actually buy such a Manipravalam necklace!
