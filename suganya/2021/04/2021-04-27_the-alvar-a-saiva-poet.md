The Āḻvār who was a Śaiva poet

While looking for information about Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār for a talk, I realised many things: 1) he looks down upon the other belief systems (barely surprising), 2) the hagiographic texts, especially the later ones make much of it, i.e. so far as to claim that he “converted” to each of the systems he enumerates, and finally became a Vaiṣṇava (and in some versions, thanks so to Poykai Āḻvār \[see image below\]), and 3) there is a parallel story on the Śaiva side claiming him to be a Śaiva poet.

In his *[Nāṉmukaṉ Tiruvantāti](https://archive.org/details/thesacredbookoffourthousand01nalayiradivyaprabandhamsriramabharati2000)*, he berates the “Others”, chiefly because their knowledge of the truth, of the true God is flawed:

And he spends more time and words to belittle Śiva, more than the other deities and their worshippers. Which made me wonder if he truly felt the need to do so, as a fresh convert who needs to prove himself. The hagiographic texts get inspired by this and describe a battle between Śiva and the Āḻvār, in which the former opens fire from his third eye on the forehead, and the latter responds by opening fire from his third eye located… on his big toe! The Āḻvār wins, of course.

Now, while going through Zvelebil’s *The Smile of Murugan* I think, I realised that there was a Śaiva poet called Civavākkiyar, whose style (metre, themes, words, etc.) is similar to Tirumaḻicai’s, and the two have been identified as one and the same. For example, the first few verses of the Āḻvār’s *Tiruccantaviruttam* (of contested authorship, but I believe in the single authorship of both the works mentioned here, namely the NTA and the TCV) use numbers, for example, to say that God is the five, the five, the five, and the five. Civavākkiyar, too, has such verses. As “a number of stanzas ascribed to both poets are nearly identical”, Zvelebil thinks that the two could be the same person, or that Civavākkiyar copied from his predecessors (I’d rather use the term “inspire”).

This Civavākkiyar is dated to the 9th-10th centuries, as he seems to have been quoted by the “earlier” Paṭṭiṉattār (Gosh! Was there more than one then??) in the 10th-11th c., in his *Tiruviṭaimarutūr Mummaṇikkōvai* There was another poet by the same name (Civavākkiyar) in the 16th c., a Siddha poet at that. Which is why [an older edition of Civavākkiyar’s verses](https://www.tamildigitallibrary.in/book-detail.php?id=jZY9lup2kZl6TuXGlZQdjZU9kuly&tag=பெரிய%20சிவவாக்கியர்%20பாடல்%20%20:%20மூலமும்-உரையும்#book1/17), of which around 500 still exist, refer to him as the “Periya” (elder) Civavākkiyar. No wonder, we have so many comedy of errors in this field!

The interesting thing is that Civavākkiyar seems to praise the eight-lettered mantra (technically-speaking, the Nārāyaṇa mantra), which the modern commentator interprets somehow as Śiva’s mantra. And the poet also suggests that people recite Rāma’s name!

And the modern commentator says *itu avar vaiṣṇava ārāycciyil irunta kālattil pāṭappeṟṟatu* (‘This was sung when he was investigating the Vaiṣṇava \[faith\]’)…

The modern editor also borrows Tirumaḻicai’s story from the Vaiṣṇava hagiographies (and attributes as their source oral traditions), and claims that Tirumaḻicai finally found the right path and became a Śaiva:

And he even got married according to the story!

I guess I could go on on the topic. I need to write an article, looking more closely at Civavākkiyar’s verses. Although they seem later to me, they certainly have piqued my curiosity.
