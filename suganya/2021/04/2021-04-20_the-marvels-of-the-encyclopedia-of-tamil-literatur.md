The marvels of the Encyclopedia of Tamil Literature

The *Abithana Chintamani* (அபிதான சிந்தாமணி) is a work whose existence I only recently discovered, I must confess with shame. It would have been so useful all these years… But I’m a believer that books have a way of finding their ways to us when we need them most, so I’m glad that this one did!

A. Singaravelu Mudaliyar (1855-1931), a scholar of Tamil, Telugu and Sanskrit, and a professor of Tamil at Pachaiyappa’s College in Chennai, started working on this work in ca 1890, and it took him 20 years to produce the 1000+page volume, while he was working as a Tamil professor. Two decades is a short period of time even for a team of scholars to produce such a monumental work. Anyway, he published it first in 1910, after much trouble, as money was scarce. He continued to work on it for many more years, editing and adding information. The second, improved edition was over 1600 pages long.

The author’s preface which lists the type of subjects that he has dealt with (Too bad he only addresses the men, though…)

I recently upgraded from a [PDF of this book](https://archive.org/details/dli.jZY9lup2kZl6TuXGlZQdjZM9jupy.TVA_BOK_0009120), to buy [a hard copy](https://www.amazon.in/Abithana-Chintamani-Encyclopedia-Tamil-Literature/dp/8193356098/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=chintamani+tamil&qid=1618888742&sr=8-1), a beautiful reprint by the Asian Publications. And the last couple of weeks, I used it briefly to look into a few names that I needed for a talk that I gave at Harvard University. But I finally had the time to explore it at leisure, and here are some entries:

A random look shows that these entries define epithets, like He whose chest has Śrī and a mole; gives an epithet of Kaṇṇaki that I had never heard of. It names Viṣṇu’s weapons and incarnations. It lists a few names of Śrīvaiṣṇavas that I haven’t necessarily heard of, and tells us who they were. And so forth.

And all these entries point at further entries for more information, and one could spend hours just playing at this game.

This page gives copious information on the *kūttu* dance tradition, getting into the sort of details that I didn’t even know existed (This book could be as much about Mudaliyar’s knowledge, as on my ignorance. But I still find it irritating Kamil Zvelebil should judge the work as “of great value, although of very uneven quality”. I’m fascinated by how much of a good opinion he had of himself!)

Anyway, It would take many lifetimes to just explore this work, so I find it hard to imagine how an individual, who had other responsibilities, was able to accomplish this feat. This book was the passion of his life, which drove him to accomplish the impossible. It is worth noting that Mudaliyar was also on the Śaiva Siddhānta committee of the *Madras Tamil Lexicon* project. Impressive scholar, the kind that was produced (only?) in the early 20th c.-Tamil land.

Now back to exploring it.
