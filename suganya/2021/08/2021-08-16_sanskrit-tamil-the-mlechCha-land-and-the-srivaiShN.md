Sanskrit, Tamil, the mleccha land, and the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas

Yesterday someone asked me about whether the expression ஈரத் தமிழ் இருக்க முரட்டு ஸம்ஸ்க்ருதம் ஏன்? (‘Why rough Sanskrit, when there is pleasant Tamil?’) actually did exist in the *Īṭu*, as claimed by writer Indira Parthasarathy in one of his latest [tweets](https://twitter.com/Eeepaa/status/1426782146123886593). I tried a word search, which didn’t yield much. A Google search pointed out that there might be something in one of the commentaries on *Tiruvāymoḻi* 9.2.8.

As a matter of fact, it is in the subcommentary to the *Īṭu*, the *Jīyar arumpatavurai*, that we find something that echoes the idea above: it mentions *muraṭṭu samskṛtam* to explain a brief mention of Vaṅkipurattu Nampi made in the *Īṭu* commentary on *Tiruvāymoḻi* 9.2.8: As Nampi blesses Raṅganātha with the words *vijayasva* *vijayī bhava*, despite hearing simple cowherdesses who were visiting the temple praying for His wellbeing in Tamil, he is asked if he couldn’t get rid of the *muraṭṭu samskṛtam* even then.

The Jīyar Arumpatavurai that explains the above passage

This anecdote shows the affection in which the Acharyas held Tamil. It did not by any means indicate that they looked down upon Sanskrit, because they did not. The two languages were their two eyes, clichéd as it might sound. What provoked me into writing this post is a reaction to the Tweet above by somebody who apparently was trying to defend the position of Sanskrit among the Tamils:

This is nothing but overreaction, not understanding the context in which Parthasarathy tweeted what he did (which he didn’t make it clear, unfortunately, but then, it’s not a blog post). This person jumped to the defence of Sanskrit, just as many jump to the defence of Tamil. Really? Do these languages need such people (often trolls, who are unaware they are trolls) to defend them? I’m not so sure. Everything is politicised nowadays, and it’s nearly impossible to engage in a constructive conversation, as names are called, traitors are spotted everywhere, people’s words are (wilfully or otherwise) misinterpreted. Tiresome. Unhealthy.

Anyway, I’m a firm believer that context is absolutely everything, as words do not mean *any*thing unless we look into what context they were uttered in. And by whom. And what we know about them. Plus, it is essential not to make chronocentric judgements (or judgements of *any* kind, ideally).

A few other expressions in the *Īṭu* left me puzzled in the past. Like anecdotes suggesting that an Acharya (like Parāśara Bhaṭṭar) gave an example from Tamil literature (e.g. from the Kuṟuntokai) in reply to an objection raised by a *Tamiḻaṉ* concerning the interpretation of a certain word. I’ve wondered whether the Acharyas (those who are quoted and those are writing) did not identify themselves as Tamils till I got an answer when listening to Velukkudi Swami, who simply glossed *Tamiḻaṉ* as “Tamil scholar”, or rather, “scholar of Tamil”, and then everything made sense. When the Acharyas suggest an interpretation of a given *pācuram* based on a peculiar meaning of a (Tamil) word, scholars specialising in Tamil may have first objected and then were pacified by the discourser. (We may even wonder whether those Tamil scholars were disciples of the Acharyas, or whether some of the teaching sessions were open to all, and they attracted all sorts of scholars).

More troubling is the description of the Lord of Tirumāliruñcōlaimalai, whose “affability (…) consists in showing His face even (?) to those who live in the *mleccha* land that the Āryas despise” (ஆரியர்கள் இகழ்ந்த ம்லேச்சபூமியில் உள்ளோருக்கும் முகம் கொடுத்துக் கொண்டு இருக்கிற நீர்மை – *Īṭu* 2.2 *avatārikai*). Is that a reference to the Madurai region? Or is the “Dravidian” land? It seems that I heard somewhere that it’s all the places South of the Vindhya mountains. But did the Acharyas approve of such a claim? Did they not consider themselves as ‘Aryas’ (and no, I’m most definitely NOT discussing ethnic origins here, as in ‘Aryan’ versus ‘Dravidian’, most emphatically NO), i.e., ‘respectable people’ or some such thing?

Presumably, the Aryas that they refer to here are people like Manu, who seems to have said this:

कृष्णसारस्तु चरति मृगो यत्र स्वभावतः ।  
स ज्ञेयो यज्ञियो देशो म्लेच्छदेशस्त्वतः परः ॥ २३ ॥

*kṛṣṇasārastu carati mṛgo yatra svabhāvataḥ*\|  
*sa jñeyo yajñiyo deśo mlecchadeśastvataḥ paraḥ*\|\| 4. 23 \|\|

But the region where the spotted deer roams by nature is to be known as the ‘land fit for sacrificial acts’; beyond that is the ‘land op the Mlecchas.’ (23) (tr. Ganganath Jha)

Did the Śrīvaiṣṇava Acharyas think so too? Well, you wouldn’t even ask yourself that question if you knew them. Even a little. All you need to do, is as yourself if they would have exchanged Śrīraṅgam (which is technically-speaking located in *mleccha* land) for some ultra sacred place up in the north, say, Vārāṇasī, or even Mathurā or Ayodhyā. Much as they loved these above places, the answer would have been ‘no’ for most of them. Even Vaikuṇṭha, the ultimate destination, paled in comparison with Śrīraṅgam. In my opinion, Nampiḷḷai (who is the author of the words found in the *Īṭu*) would have reported what was thought of the Southern land by the high and mighty, in order to imply that he was (like the Acharyas such as himself) unruffled by such comments, which they may even have found diverting (while definitely respecting Manu and the like).

What do you think? Well, I should search all the occasions where such expressions are used and study the context before I jump to conclusions, because it doesn’t help anyone, does it?
