The funny story behind the Rāma temple in Periya Mudaliyar Chavadi

A couple of days ago, I went (or at least tried to go) to this Pattabhiramar temple located in Periya Mudaliyar Chavadi in the outskirts of Pondicherry. My last attempt to go there a few years ago was equally fruitless, as the temple seems to have its own peculiar opening timings. Anyway, my first visit was in 2009, and the reason I went there out of the beaten track was that I was invited there.

Here’s the funny story behind this: my cousin’s husband, Hari Mama, belonged to this neighbourhood (and his brother still lives there), and he once asked me to sponsor a *pañcalohavigraham* of Lakṣmaṇa for the temple, as there could be no *puṟappāṭu* (‘procession’) of the Deities already present there, namely, Rāma and Sītā, without Lakṣmaṇa. And I did as he asked. He gave me updated news of the process once in a while, as the *vigraham* was made to order in Kumbakonam. Months passed, and the *vigraham* got ready. They were all set to ritually install it. So far, so good.

Further months passed, and the next thing I heard was that they realised that the Deities already present there were actually Nārāyaṇa along with Lakṣmī! And poor Lakṣmaṇa stood there, out of place. But happily, not for long. They found further sponsors and got *vigraham*s of Rāma, Sītā and Hanumān made. And that was when, during one my summer visits to India, I was invited to the temple. Some of the villagers honoured us, and happily claimed Lakṣmaṇa had called the rest of his family to where he was, once he set his foot there.

It was at that time being renovated, so people told me I could step inside the *garbhagṛha* as a painter was working there anyway, which I resolutely refused to do.

Above and left: renovation works in progress in 2009.

That’s me sitting down and doing God knows what to the steps leading to the shrine (or lighting a lamp?) as a local lady watches.

On the other hand, I could not turn down the offer to sit by the side of the *vigraham*s of the triad placed outside, as they had yet to be ritually installed. As it was pre-cellphone days, I made neither photos, nor selfies, but enjoyed the moment and committed it to my memory, which has since become rather vague. Who said new technology wasn’t a good thing?

Here’s “my” Lakṣmaṇa!

With his brother and sister-in-law

And Hanumān

EDIT: Thankfully, my father’s phone threw up some of the older photos as memories. And a good thing, too.

Anyway, the Nārāyaṇa temple has been turned into a Rāma one by a hilarious misidentification by a few innocent but well-meaning villagers.

And I still hope to visit its premises, now that it is a functioning temple. I know, this might come across as blowing my own trumpet, but it’s a favourite one, and I couldn’t let my incidental role in this come in the way of the narration of a good story!

PS: it’s not very clear what the *mūlavar*s were/are! I can see both couples are there on the photos, but I don’t remember seeing two shrines inside. Precisely why I need to visit this place and refresh my memories.
