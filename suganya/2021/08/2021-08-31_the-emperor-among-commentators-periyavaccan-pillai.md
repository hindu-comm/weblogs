The Emperor among commentators, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai

Amidst the enthusiastic celebrations of Janmāṣṭami, it is often forgotten that another great soul shared the birthday, thereby claimed to be an incarnation Krishna Himself by many Śrīvaiṣṇavas. And that is Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, my favourite Ācārya, a prolific writer and a scholar of towering heights, whose writings introduced me to Manipravalam and whetted my appetite for more. But enough on his influence on my scholarship and myself as a person, let’s focus on him instead.

A*pūrvaśikhā*brahmin by birth, Piḷḷai was born as Kṛṣṇapāda at Ceṅkaṉūr, locatedin the Tañcāvūr disctrict (I really must go there, sooner rather than later!) According to a late hagiographic text, the*Patineṭṭāyirappaṭi,*his father was called Yāmuna Deśikar, and his mother, Nāycciyārammāḷ. These are distinctly Śrīvaiṣṇava names, and yet, it has been claimed by some scholars that he was the only Vaiṣṇava in the family, and therefore, had to leave them. Different versions make different suggestions, including that he went on a pilgrimage to Tirupati and remained there, and another which claims that he fled his hometown to Śrīraṅgam due to Śaiva persecution (I think that is Dehejia’s claim). Hard to say. What we can claim with more confidence is that he joined Nampiḷḷai, from whom he learnt, and led a peaceful life in Śrīraṅgam. He groomed many disciples, including Vādikesari Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Jīyar, who composed a commentary that gave the word-by-word meanings of the *Tiruvāymoḻi.*

Kṛṣṇapāda was given the title ‘Periyavāccāṉ’ (*periya + āccāṉ*= the great Ācārya), the name by which we all know him. He also got other lesser known titles like *abhayapradarājar*,and *drāviḍa-veda-bhāṣyakārar*, or ‘the commentator on the Tamil Vedas’, as he composed commentaries on all the works of the *Divyaprabandham*. Which also earned him the very apt title *paramakāruṇikar* – ‘the most compassionate’, as he dedicated his whole life to compose these, but also commentaries on a selection of verses from the *Rāmāyaṇa*, on Rāmānuja’s *Gadyatrayam*, and so forth. He also was a pioneer by writing the first *rahasyagrantha*s in Manipravalam, a trend that picked up momentum with passing time, influencing eminent Ācāṛyas such as Piḷḷai Lokācārya and Vedānta Deśika. Not to mention works like the *Pācurappaṭi Rāmāyaṇ*a*m*, a *Rāmāyaṇa* composed with words and expressions extracted from the *Divyaprabandham*. Some of his works are attributed to his (adoptive?) son, Nāyaṉār Accāṉ Piḷḷai, but even then, his body of works remains impressive and inspiring.

Here’s a passage from his *Rāmāyaṇa Taṉiślokam* that I translated, in which he wonders why the verse *iyaṃ sītā mama sutā* mentions Her hands His, as Janaka requests Rāma to take Sītā’s during the *pāṇīgrahaṇa* rite:

The background is black thanks to the night mode…

“\[Janaka’s\] not saying “*pāṇinā pāṇim*” (“\[holding\], with \[His\] hand, \[Her\] hand”) is because “\[Her\] handsurpasses \[His\] in enjoyableness,” so that one could say “having placed My hand” (cf. *Nācciyār Tirumoḻi* 6.9)above “\[His\] graceful hand” (*Nācciyār Tirumoḻi* 6.8). The affability and enjoyableness \[of Her arms\] indeed surpass \[His\] so that even the Pond of emeralds \[Rāma\] begotten by Daśaratha, the shade of whose bulky shoulders are such that both the worlds fit into a small corner \[of it\], will immerse into \[Hers\], as said in ‘You who embraced the shoulders of the slender woman!’ so that \[His\] fatigue is destroyed.The beauty of the shoulders of “Her whose beautiful shoulders are like bamboos” (*Periya Tirumoḻi* 9.4) surpasses \[His\], being a shade for both the sentient beings and God, with the heat caused by the fire of Khara’s arrows having abated – as said in“\[She\] warmly embraced \[Her husband\] who had killed the enemy” (*Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* 3.29.35; tr. Pollock),and the heat that is God’s independence also having abated. (***pāṇiṃ gṛḥṇīṣva pāṇinā***) And she too will have been “dreaming of \[Him\] holding \[Her\] hand” (*Nācciyār Tirumoḻi*6.6) with \[His\] hand.”

I’m not sure that I’ve done justice to the beauty of this passage, especially with all the square brackets, inverted commas, and references to his quotations. But it just shows the depth of his knowledge as he quotes from a wide breadth of texts, in Sanskrit and Tamil. And his imagination knows no bounds, as he compares Sītā with Āṇṭāḷ (and their weddings), which he also does in his commentary on the decade *vāraṇam āyiram* from the latter’s *Nācciyār Tirumoḻi.*

I wish I could render all this great scholar-devotee’s works into English, making them more widely accessible. I have managed to translate so far two of his commentaries, and one of his *rahasyagrantha* (although I can’t claim that they have all seen the light of the day. Yet.) So this is what I pray from him on his birthday!
