[BL-EAP] Beginning work on a British Library – Endangered Archives Programme project

After many, many obstacles, we officially started working today on our [British Library-Endangered Archives Programme](https://eap.bl.uk) pilot [project](http://eap.bl.uk/project/EAP1294), supported by [Arcadia](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk). With me as the project leader, and Giovanni Ciotti and S.A.S. Sarma as co-applicants, the project called “Safeguarding for Posterity Two Private Collections of Palm-Leaf Manuscripts from the Tamil Country” seeks to do what its title suggests. And to achieve that, we have four staff members who will work to clean, catalogue and digitise the collections for the next ten months or so, depending on how the Covid situation evolves. And the work will take place at the [EFEO](https://www.efeo.fr/base.php?code=227) centre in Pondicherry.

Palm-leaf manuscripts from the KK collection wrapped in cotton cloth

A word on the two collections of manuscripts that will be cleaned, catalogued, partially digitised (and then returned to the original owners):

1\) The Kalliṭaikuṟicci collection (KK) was given away to me byProf. G. Vijayavenugopalin August 2019. Hehad the collection sent to him via a truck parcel (!)in 1981 by a friend, who had found the manuscripts discarded in the street at the death of their owner, in a village near Kalliṭaikuṟicci, in the deep South of Tamilnadu. No other information is available to us (yet) about the original owners or their place(s) of origin. I do suspect, however, that they belong to a family of Brahmins who belonged to the Vaṭakalai school of Śrīvaiṣṇavism, which is corroborated by the presence of many of Vedānta Deśika’s works, as well as the mention of some*jīyar*s of the Ahobila Maṭha (=Vaṭakalai*maṭh*a*)* in some of the colophons I found without looking too hard. Prof VVG said that they belonged to some kind of *jīyar*, and I suspect it must have been a family of Ācāryapuruṣas. I really can’t wait to see what the colophons can reveal about them! Other than Śrīvaiṣṇava works, the KK collection comprises works that any self-respecting scholar would have learnt/read in the 19th c., i.e. *nyāya*, *vyākaraṇa*, etc. A preliminary look shows us that Grantha is by far the most used script here.

2\) The Villiampākkam (VP) collection is a set of manuscripts that Dr. V. C. Govindarajan (my former Sanskrit teacher, who is still very much dedicated to [teaching Sanskrit](http://kalidasakendram.blogspot.com) via more [modern means](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8WalXznHX0nvzeF8joiSg?view_as=subscriber) now) collected from different sources almost two decades ago. We’re yet to see what sort of works the manuscripts contain. These will also be worked upon from Pondicherry, where they will be taken care of during the length of the project (and then returned to the owner).

Sri U. Ve. K. Malolakannan will be cataloguing for us. A [famous reciter of the *Divyaprabandham* verses and of other *stotra*s, including Vedānta Deśika’s](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=malola+kannan) and a PhD student about to defend his dissertation at the Rashtriya Saṃkṛta Saṃsthānam in Tirupati, he is looking forward to exploring the manuscripts. If things go as planned both collections will be fully catalogued by the end of the project.

Ramya Rajagopal (labelling MSS today)

Ramya Rajagopal, who has worked for other projects involving the EFEO, and S. Venkatarajan, who has experience working for a BL project, will be digitising the collections.

And D. Murugesan will be cleaning and oiling the manuscripts.

As for the co-applicants, [Sarma Sir](https://www.efeo.fr/chercheurs.php?code=1009&l=EN&ch=67) doesn’t need any introduction: his scholarship, his IT skills, and his enthusiasm and experience in the conducting of such projects make him a valuable asset. And [Giovanni Ciotti](https://www.csmc.uni-hamburg.de/about/people/ciotti.html), of course, lives and breathes manuscripts, and is our go-to-person for any question linked with the scripts and contents!

And last but not least, Prerana Patel, is the very reason why the project exists today: from encouraging me to apply, convincing me that it will work out and finding solutions when situation got too tricky, making the budget, running everything that is not strictly research-related, she deserves the biggest thanks here! And thanks also to Geetha, her assistant.

The experience we gain from this project will be key for the future: I’ve already had two people mention that very early printed material lie at some college archives that need to be preserved, as do hundreds of manuscripts in the homes of traditional scholars. So let this BL project be my own modest *hariḥ om* for undertaking larger preservation works!

And please stay tuned for further updates!
