A few thoughts on the acit principle

Yesterday, we finished reading the Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s *Sakalapramāṇatātparyam*, which, despite its appearance, was quite challenging. And so cryptic at times, that lengthy footnotes to bring out the (hopefully) intended meanings. My article on the treatise is made of footnotes rather than analysis. As usual, as one might say. But then, the original text is so interesting, that I feel it is quite enough to bring the translation to the reader, at least for the moment.

Anyway, Piḷḷai defines all the important tenets of Viśīṣṭādvaita in this treatise in Manipravalam, and in the process, defines the three *tattva*s (‘true principles’), cit (‘sentient’), acit (‘insentient’) and *īśvara* (God). Hardly surprising in a Viśiṣṭādvaitic manual. And while listening to Velukkudi Krishnan’s *granthakālakṣepam* (in other words, a proper lecture) on the SPT, I heard that the *acit* principle also exists in Vaikuṇṭha, because the place has trees with fruit, incense for worship, chairs, steps, and what not. Except that the *acit* there is *śuddhasattvam*, i.e. unmixed with *rajas* and *tamas*, unlike here, in our world. But then, I seemed to understand at some point during his talk that what determines the form of the *acit* is karma. But he doesn’t say that outright. Nor does he not say it. I’m just getting confused, trying to read between the lines.

So this question has been going round in my mind for a while, and I have been discussing it with the other participants of the reading session, but I haven’t yet found a satisfactory answer. So I thought I might voice it on a more public platform, so here you go.

While the births (or non-births) of the sentient beings depend on their karma, God, unsurprisingly, is devoid of it. Anything He does, or feel, or any birth that He takes, are based on His wishes (*icchā*). ‘What about the *acit* principle then?’ I asked. Marion promptly replied, ‘How can there be a karma \[whether as in action, or as in result of an action\] when the *acit* cannot act, by definition?’ Giggles. I didn’t give up: ‘Then why are some *acit* entities (can we even use the plural??) sewage water, and others are used to make *vigraha*s worshipped in temples?’ ‘Well, they don’t have feelings that would make them feel bad about it, right?’ Bang came Elisa’s reply. More giggles.

But then, what determines which bit should become gold, and which bit becomes our bodies? God’s will? So there’s no logical reason here? Or does the karma of the *jīvātmā* inhabiting it (probably while awaiting a body) determine it? Any ideas?
