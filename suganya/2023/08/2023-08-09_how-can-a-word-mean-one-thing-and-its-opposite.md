How can a word mean one thing and its opposite?

While commenting on the Amalaṉ Āti Pirāṉ, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai tries to explain why Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār, who is clearly describing Periyaperumāḷ, the Lord of Śrīraṅgam, suddenly mentions the Lord of Tiruvēṅkaṭam:

And Piḷḷai tries to undestand why the Āḻvār’s mind suddenly flies hundreds of miles north to Veṅkaṭam while enjoying the beauty of the Lord of Raṅgam:

Comparing the enjoyment of God to rushing floods is not a new thing, nor is comparing His beauty to floods. The Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas speak of *anubhava-parīvāha* elsewhere when they feel the Āḻvārs’ verses are a means for them to let out the irrepressibly overwhelming emotions. Now, what does this *āḻaṅkāl* mean? Depth (*āḻam*) + kāl (*leg*)? Let’s check the *Madras Tamil Lexicon*:

Well, clearly this local usage is not what the commentator had in mind. In this case, it must be a reference to a peg that was driven deep into the wall, to which the cupboard would be secured. Does Piḷḷai think that the Āḻvār wanted to be secured like that by going to Veṅkaṭam? Sounds unlikely. Let’s keep exploring the *Madras Tamil Lexicon*:

Well, this looks more appropriate. Does Piḷḷai mean to say that the Āḻvār’s mind—too overjoyed at the sight of Raṅganātha and thus unable to bear the intensity of the floods of His beauty and his own experience of it—seeks and finds solace in Veṅkaṭam, which is relatively shallow waters? But the context is ambiguous, to say the least, as Piḷḷai continues:

ஆற்றிலேயழுந்துவார் ஆழங்காலிலே இளைப்­பாறத் தேடுமாபோலே அவர்களும் வந்து அடிமை செய்யுமிடம்.

Just as those drowning in the river seek to rest in the depths, this is where they (i.e. the celestials), too, come to serve \[Him\].

Does that mean that the celestials (Nityasūris) too come to Veṅkaṭam to find solace from their intense experience of the Lord in Vaikuṇṭham? Not sure. The *Madras Tamil Lexicon* might hold the key to the question, if we search harder:

So to “undergo *āḻaṅkāl*” could also mean “to be immersed, to get drowned”, which is contradictory to the definition “shallow water” mentioned above. So does Piḷḷai mean to say that the Āḻvār found solace in Veṅkaṭam, which offers a less intense experience to him, who has become overwhelmed by his experience in Śrīraṅgam? Or does he actually mean to say that the Āḻvār, who was hoping to find solace in Veṅkaṭam, chose the wrong place and was out of the pan and into the fire, so to speak, except that we need to imagine his situation to a more watery struggle?

How can the ***āḻaṅkāl*** hint both at deep waters and shallow water? Can a word/expression mean one thing and its opposite? How do we understand Piḷḷai’s explanation of the Āḻvār’s words? Perhaps the key lies in the example that the *Madras Tamil Lexicon* gives to illustrate the meaning of ‘shallow waters’, a verse from the *Kurukūr Paḷḷu* by Caṭakōpa Pulavar. Does that verse help us any further? We’ll see that next time.

(To be continued…)
