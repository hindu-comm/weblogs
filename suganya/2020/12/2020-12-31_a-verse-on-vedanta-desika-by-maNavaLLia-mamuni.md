A verse on Vedānta Deśika by Maṇavāḷa Māmuni?

Maṇavāḷa Māmuni’s (15th c.) *Upatēca Rattiṉamālai* is a set of around 73 verses which praise the Āḻvārs and the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, along with giving information about that (birth dates, works they composed, etc.).When I was translating it (it’s done now, and hopefully will be published soon), I wondered why Māmuni left out Deśika. Did he not approve of him? Did he not consider him scholarly enough? Because Māmuni enumerates the major commentaries on the *Nālāyira Divyaprabandham* written by the Ācāryas, why did he not add Deśika to the list? Because Deśika has written a commentary on the *Amalaṉ Āti Pirāṉ*, and a couple of others that are not extent anymore, e.g. the *Nigamaparimaḷam* on the *Tiruvāymoḻi.*

I seem to have gotten my answer as I listened to U. Vē. V. S. [Karunakarachariar’s](https://www.facebook.com/nadadoor.ammal) splendid keynote address during the celebrations of Māmuni’s 650th year by the Alumni Association of Vaishnavism and the University of Madras on August 20-22, 2020. Like me, he too was sorry that Māmuni had ignored Deśika. But he said that, in an edition of the *Upatēca Rattiṉamālai* (by Rama Sarma and Madapusi Varadarajan?), published in Melkote, he came across an extra verse, which, startlingly, was dedicated to Vedānta Deśika:

விஞ்சும் அன்பொன்றாலே நம் பாணன் தன்னுயிராம்

செஞ்சொல் மதுரகவி யார்தம் அஞ்சுயிராம்

வேங்கடவன் வேதத்தைஇரண்டொன்றை உரைசெய்யாத்

தங்கியதென் நெஞ்சுள் நிலா.

viñcum aṉp’ oṉṟālē nam pāṇaṉ taṉ uyirām

cem col maturakaviyār tam añc’ uyirām

vēṅkaṭavaṉ vētattai iraṇṭ’ oṉṟai urai ceyyā

taṅkiyat’ eṉ neñcuḷ nilā.

As Vēṅkaṭanātha, out of a unique, surpassing love, composed commentaries

on a couple of Vedas,— which are the lifebreath of our Pāṇaṉ,

and the bright lifebreath of Madhurakavi of great words —,

moonlight remained inside my heart!

Please note that this is a working translation of a verse that can be read in different ways. Anyway, the point is that Māmuni did not leave out Deśika, and recognised his contribution to the world of commentaries on the *Divya Prabandham*. Karunakarachariar went on to back up the finding with another verse, this time by Māmuni’s grandson (Abhirāmavarar/Jīyar Nāyaṉār), who translated the whole *Upatēca Rattiṉamālai* into Sanskrit (simply known as *Upadeśaratnamālā*):

प्राणायितां श्रुतिमतिप्रियपाणसूरेः पञ्चासुवत्सुवचनां मधुराख्यसूरेः।

श्रीवेङ्कटेश उभयीं उदितां विवव्रे साऽन्तर्ममास्ति हृदये स्थिरचन्द्रिकेव॥

prāṇāyitāṃ śrutimatipriyapāṇasūreḥ pañcāsuvatsu vacanāṃ madhurākhyasūreḥ \|

śrīveṅkaṭeśa ubhayīṃ uditāṃ vivavre sā’ntarmamāsti hṛdaye sthiracandrikeva \|\|

I’m yet to translate this verse, and while reading this, I could also see that the Tamil verse above can be understood in a different way. I’ll need to work on that.

In my editions of both works, these verses are missing, as they probably are in most available manuscripts. Why is it so? Did someone decide —at some point during the transmission process since the 15th c.—that Māmuni praising Deśika could not be allowed? And therefore, he (I’m sure it’s not a woman!) edited out the verse? Or was the Tamil verse an interpolation by someone who wanted Deśika honoured by the other Ācārya? But how then to explain the Sanskrit verse? Any thoughts? (Also, has anyone access to this particular printed edition, or at least have bibliographic references)?

PS: you can watch here some of the talks given at the event, including Karunakarachar’s:
