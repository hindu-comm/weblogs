Thoughts on (the) saṭhāri

There recently was a call for papers on the distinguishing features of the different Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya*s. The use of the *śaṭhāri* in Śrīvaiṣṇava temples came to my mind, although it’s only a minor distinction. So here are some ideas that occurred to me.

The *śaṭhāri* is a crown-like object that is placed as a benediction upon the head of the devotee visiting a Śrīvaiṣṇava temple or some such sacred place, just for a few seconds. It is also known as the *śaṭhakopam* in some regions, like the Telugu-speaking world. On top of this crown, we find represented the feet of Nārāyaṇa, so symbolically, the devotee gets blessed by the feet of the Lord. But why does it bear those above names? because it is named after Śaṭhāri, i.e. Śaṭhakopa aka Nammāḻvār \[1\]). **

But why is the crown named after an Āḻvār? Because the Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe that Nammāḻvār represents Nārāyaṇa’s feet, that he is the very personification of those feet. This probably could be traced back to Nammāḻvār’s own words in the *Tiruvāymoḻi*, in which he claims that his refuge (hence his place) lies at His feet.

Nammāḻvār’s figure on the *śaṭhāri*

It is worth noting that this crown is called “Śrī Rāmānujaṉ” in the saint-poet’s shrine in the Āḻvār Tirunakari temple, as Rāmānuja is considered as Nammāḻvār’s feet. Also interesting is that the latter’s form figures on the *śaṭhāri* in the temple at Vāṉamāmalai.

But when does the practice of placing the *śaṭhāri* upon the devotee’s head begin? The oldest textual reference I have found so far is in the Āṟāyirappaṭi commentary by Tirukkurukai Piraṉ Piḷḷāṉ (12th-13th c.), who was one of Rāmānuja’s disciples. Are there any older texts that mention it? Any early inscriptional or iconographic evidence that you know of? And what could have inspired the practice?



\[1\] A *taṉiyaṉ* (‘self-contained verse’ \[1\]) attributed to Nāthamuni (10th c.?) may be the first time the name was attributed to the Āḻvār.For more on the *taṉiyaṉ* verses, see Suganya Anandakichenin. “[The*Taṉiyaṉ*: Its Role, Evolution and Importance in the Śrīvaiṣṇava Tradition](https://www.academia.edu/44761519/The_Ta%E1%B9%89iya%E1%B9%89_Its_Role_Evolution_and_Importance_in_the_%C5%9Ar%C4%ABvai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87ava_Tradition).” In *Colophons, Prefaces, Satellite Stanza – Paratextual Elements and Their Role in Transmission History*.
