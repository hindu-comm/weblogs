The bṛndāvanams of the Śrīvaiṣṇava ascetics – 2. Piḷḷai Lokācārya in Jyotiṣkuṭi

Jyotiṣkuṭi is located in the Yāṉaimalai (‘elephant hill’) hill ranges, considered sacred for the Jains, and close to a famous Narasiṃha temple in Naraciṅkampaṭṭi, an 8^(th)c. rock-cut Pāṇḍya temple. And in this relatively isolated village, there are at least three shrines on the way to the*tiruvaracu*at the base of the hill, around a large, water tank with waterlilies, whose name according to the*sthalapurāṇa*is Brahmatīrtham.

The Vedanārāyaṇa temple

The third shrine, and the closest to the *tiruvaracu*, is the east-facing Vedanārāyaṇa Perumāḷ temple. Apparently renovated recently, it seems relatively old, being rock-made, and especially given the simplicity of its style (e.g. no vimāna). Here, the*mūlamūrti*is a standing Nārāyaṇa, with an*abhayahasta*, and to His left, in an unsurprising hierarchical scale, there is a smaller figure of a one-headed Brahmā worshipping Him. There are no consorts,*utsavamūrti*s or Garuḍa. We also see*viṣṇupāda*s (Viṣṇu’s footprints) upon a*pīṭha*outside the*garbhagṛha*.

This modern inscription in the Tamil script, the deciphering of which is made difficult by the red and white paints, still clearly shows a date (30-01-1965), which probably corresponds to the date of the last renovation.

About ten metres away from this temple, there is a flight of stairs that leads one to the*tiruvaracu*of Piḷḷai Lokācārya, which is located higher on the hill. A pannel announces that it is the*tiruvaracu*of Piḷḷai Lokācārya, noting that it is the spot from where “he adorned the Sacred Land \[Vaikuṇṭha\]” (*tirunāṭu alaṅkaritta iṭam*).

Once we reach the level of the shrine, we notice a shrine with a small*vimāna*, and some space for doing the*pradakṣiṇa*, delimited by boulders and by the hill on all three sides. On the left, modern carvings on granite gives the following information: the story of Piḷḷai Lokācārya up to his passing away; the fact the old structure was worn out (*jīrṇam*), and that it was renovated in 2007.

The small, modern Dravidian-syle shrine facing east has a small*vimāna*, with*teṉkalai tirumaṇ*s (Vaiṣṇava mark) painted on either side of the main door. Different concrete-made, painted figures adorn the*vimāna*including those Piḷḷai Lokācārya, Rāmānuja, other Ācāryas with their disciples, and of course, Nārāyaṇa with His consorts in the front.

The *tiruvaracu* houses a*mūla-mūrti*of Piḷḷai Lokācārya, still worshipped as the burning incense, the clothes (white dhotī as he was not a*sannyāsin*), garland and the*tirumaṇ-kāppu*show. Special*pūjā*is conducted on the Tiruvōṇam asterism of the Aippaci month, the birthday of Piḷḷai, during which the place should be teeming with many people, unlike the random day in March 2019 when I went there.
