The bṛndāvanams of the Śrīvaiṣṇava ascetics – 3. Tuvarimāṉkuṭi

Slightly away from a bustling neighbourhood lies the sleepy, quaint Tuvarimāṉ*agrahāram*, with the Raṅgarāja Perumāḷ temple at its heart.

Its main shrine has Nārāyaṇa in a standing posture, accompanied by His two wives, Śrī and Bhū on either side. In the antechamber, there are a few icons of a few Āḻvārs and Ācāryas, worshipped along with the main Deity. There are separate shrines for Garuḍa (in front of the*garbhagṛha*), Hayagrīva and Kṛṣṇa. Claimed to be 800 years old, the temple is considered as the Dvārakā (*tuvari*) of the South.

Outside the temple, to the right, lies the*bṛṇdāvanam*of the Jīyar. The whole place includes a shrine and a passage for doing*pradakṣiṇā*with shining new walls. The passage hosts a seat used by the Jīyar and modern inscriptions with information about him, including his image and his*taṉiyaṉ*, or solitary verse \[of praise\].

The shrine itself was built when the Jīyar passed away, and the rock structure is a simple one: a low*jagati*; “undecorated” walls on either side of the entrance, except for the blown-up, framed photos of the Jīyars of the Ahobila maṭha, and one above it. A couple of steps that take one to the antechamber, beyond which is the shrine of the Jīyar. The latter houses both a*mūla-mūrti*and an utsava-mūrti. Both*mūrti*s are adorned with Vaṭakalai*tirumaṇ kāppu*s, ochre robes (suitable to a*sannyāsin*), garlands, and colourful*pavitram*s made of cotton; the usual vessels for worship, and silver*pādukā*s (or more likely silver-plated wooden ones that he used).

The priest explains to the visiting devotees that performing certain rites at the shrine ensures certain fruits, e.g. the riddance of the effects of black magic or a terrible disease, as the Jīyar is believed to (still) possess*mantrasiddhi*. It is hence a busier shrine than Jyotiṣkuṭi, also probably because it is closer to a busy part of Madurai.

To conclude all three posts, we can see that there are many similarities in the practices of both the schools of Śrīvaiṣṇavism. Whether a*sannyāsin*or a lay person, the teachers have been revered with utmost devotion. Many aspects of the worship of God are duplicated here:*hāratī*and other acts of worship offered to*mūrti*s, using*pañcapātra*s, doing*pradakṣiṇā*and so forth. The Ācāryas are then very much like God on earth. Because the Ācāryas probably lived close to a temple, whether they were based at a single place, or were wandering*sannyāsin*s, their*bṛndāvanam*s, too, are found close to a temple dedicated to Nārāyaṇa.
