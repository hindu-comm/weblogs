The twenty-armed Rāmānuja!

While picking up the compendium *Ācāryavaibhavamañjari* for a quick reference, I noticed the back cover for the first time in all these years that I have had the book. And lo and behold! It has the figure of Rāmānuja wearing the white clothes of a *gṛhastha* (‘householder’), and sporting ten pairs of arms!

“Śrī Irāmānujar – Toṇṭaṉūr”

Context: Hagiographic works such as Piṉpaḻakiya Perumāḷ Jīyar’s *Aṟāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam* (GPP6k) suggest that being persecuted by a Śaiva Cōḻa king known as Kṛmikaṇṭha, Rāmānuja fled Śrīraṅgam wearing the whites of his married disciple Kūrattāḻvāṉ, who, in turn, wore his Ācārya’s saffron clothes.

And initially stopping at Toṇṭaṉūr, the ascetic lived in the area of Melkote/Tirunārāyaṇapuram (in modern-day Karnataka) for 12 years, awaiting his return to Śrīraṅgam. It is traditionally believed that Rāmānuja dug a tank near the Nampinārāyaṇa temple in the Toṇṭaṉūr village.

And the hagiographic texts narrate that this is where he took the form of the serpent Ananta (whose incarnation he is believed to be) with a thousand hoods, and debated with (and triumphed over) 12000 Jains (GPP6k, p. 249 of the 2006 edition).

To get back to the *mūrti* of Rāmānuja in this temple, (what seems to be) the actual one does not exactly correspond to the sketch above:

While here, too, the hoods are represented behind the sitting form of the ascetic in saffron garb (which alludes to his above-mentioned transformation into Ananta), we do not see more than a pair of hands. And even the main pair of hands do not hold the same *mudra*. The other hands are shown as holding palm-leaf manuscripts (two of them), an ascetic’s staff (presumably a representation of the *tridaṇḍa)* and a conch, as well as a set of *mudra*s. What is their meaning?

Other than a couple of websites that have variants of this same portrayal, is such an iconographic representation of Rāmānuja to be really found somewhere? If not, is it the fruit of a scholar’s/artists’s imagination? In which case, what could have inspired such a portrayal? Of course, it must be to highlight his greatness in a metaphorical way. But then, the only other “famous” person with twenty arms is Rāvaṇa… Any ideas?
