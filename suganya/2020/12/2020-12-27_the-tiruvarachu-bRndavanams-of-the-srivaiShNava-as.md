The bṛndāvanams of the Śrīvaiṣṇava ascetics – 1. Introduction

When I had an assignment to do for [a class on the Hindu temple offered by the OCHS](https://ochsonline.org/product/hindu-temples/) (which, by the way, was smashing good!), I wrote about these sacred burial places, especially since I had visited a couple of them just sometime before. So here’s a less academic version of the paper, which I’ll write in three posts.

The worship of the place that hosts the bodily remains of a saint is a widespread phenomenon. And the Tamil land is no exception. In a country where most “Hindus” are cremated, special people get a special treatment at death, that of being buried and worshipped. While the generic term*samādhi*(or*camāti*in Tamil) seems to be used for a tomb of any exalted person, other terms, too, are used in Tamil: e.g., the*paḷḷippaṭai*for the shrines “erected in memory of kings” (TL); the more common term *bṛndāvanam*, a ‘sepulchre of an ascetic’ (TL s.v. *piruntāvaṉam*), used in the rest of Southern India as well; and,*tiruvaracu*, for the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, especially apparently the Teṉkalai ones, whose exact etymology and meaningI’m yet to figure out (tiru = sacred, aracu=king, kingdom, the pipal tree \[TL\]?).

In a couple of posts, I will describe the tombs of two such Ācāryas, located barely 16 km away from each other, on either side of the Vaikai river in the Madurai region, which is dotted with temples of many a faith system: the first one is Piḷḷai Lokācārya’s (traditional dates: 1205-1311 CE), located in a hilly village called Jyotiṣkuṭi, and the other belongs to the 40^(th)*jīyar*of the Ahobila Maṭham, located in an*agrahāram*called Tuvarimāṉ.

Now, a couple of words on these ascetics:

1\) Piḷḷai Lokācārya was an Ācārya retrospectively seen as the head of the*Teṉkalai*(or southern) branch of Śrīvaiṣṇavism, a prolific writer, and much more. According to hagiographic texts like the*Kōyil Oḻuku*(the Srīraṅgam temple chronicles) and*Prapannāmṛtam*, he was born in Śrīraṅgam, where he lived most of his life. But the explanation for his*tiruvaracu*being located in Madurai is explained in the following way: during the second sack of Śrīraṅgam in 1323 CE (?), during which Malik Kafur, a slave-general of the Delhi Sultanate, invaded Śrīraṅgam, Piḷḷai Lokācārya and part of his entourage built a brick wall concealing the*mūla-mūrti*of the main shrine in Śrīraṅgam, took with them the*utsava-mūrti*, Namperumāḷ, and undertook a perilous journey across the Tamil land and reached Madurai. While camping in the vicinity of the city, Piḷḷai fell from a height trying to protect the*utsava-mūrti*that had slipped off, and died soon of his injuries.

2)The other Ācārya (1851-1923) was the 40^(th)*jīyar*of the Ahobila Maṭham of the Vaṭakalai (‘northern school’) persuasion, established about 1400 CE \[1\]. He became a*sannyāsin*and the head of the*maṭha*in 1913, but passed away around ten years later.

To be continued in the next post.
