A few sculptures from the Tirupati Museum

As some of you know, I visited Tirumala-Tirupati last month, and posted a few photos of my trip ([part 1](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/a-journey-to-tirupati-photo-musings-part-1/), [part 2](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/17/a-journey-to-tirupati-photo-musings-part-2/), and [part 3](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/18/a-journey-to-tirumalai-photo-musings-final-part/)), but here’s a few of them that I made of the sculptures the museum hosts. The collection is small, and most of the sculptures belong to the latter part of the 2nd millennium. And plenty of them from the 20th century! Wow, that’s ancient! But I guess they’ll become ancient some day. Anyway, I’ll just post the photos here with minimal descriptions, as I’m no specialist.

That’s at the entrance – lovely kolan, but I couldn’t go any closer

As we enter, we see this gorgeous-looking Sudarśana (above), which is apparently worshipped, but no date is given. Probably a modern one, but nonetheless gorgeous. The following one to the left is of Sūryanārāyaṇa I suppose, with the seven horses. I couldn’t get the whole thing on one frame, unfortunately. This definitely looks older, perhaps with the Nārāyaṇa in the middle being a replacement for what was there before? I guess there are books that deal with these sculptures. Too lazy (a synonym for busy, in my case) to check them out…

This wooden carving is clearly modern

From this central point where this Venkatesvara is placed, I went clockwise, while apparently, I was supposed to go the other way round. Whatever. I don’t think there was much of a logic in the way they have displayed their collection, or is there? So, here are some of them in the wrong order…

A 13th century Bhūdevī

Not sure how old the Āṇṭāḷ is, but she has been dressed up very nicely!

16th century Garuḍa

Absolutely gorgeous Garuḍa. A pity that the background should be bad with lines running up and down. But then, I’m not sure the visitors are supposed to make photos (Oops, I noticed that only much later, walking clockwise as I did).

This 16th century sculpture of Rāmānuja looked so much like the *tāṉ āṉa tirumēṉi* in Śrīraṅgam, especially the face. There’s another one of the same period:

And this wonderful 16th century Trivikrama…

And this sublime form of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār, although his face seems to have faced the harshness of the passing time (16th century).

And finally, there was a set of Āḻvārs, but I just clicked Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār, having just noticed the “No camera” sign. But then, I only had a phone, right? Loopholes, loopholes…

Anyway, there’s also Krishnadevaraya with his two wives, a replica of the figures found in the temple in Tirumalā (unless it’s the other way round).

And last but not least, there are also displays of [Bapu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bapu_(director))‘s paintings (which I presume are the originals?). His mythological paintings are one of my favourites! Many of these figure saint-poet Annamayya (early 16th century), who was a devotee of Venkatesvara, and whose songs have all been carved onto copper plates and embedded in the walls of Tirumala.

Here I clearly spot the sangita mummūrtis and also saints from the rest of India, like Mirabai

That’s all, folks! Sorry for the very basic post!
