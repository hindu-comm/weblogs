Late Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam works

This post is a call for information more than anything else, as I seek to build a list of works in Manipravalam composed after Vedānta Deśika’s/Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ’s time, no matter which *kalai* the author belonged to.

Here’s the context: I’m writing an article on modern-day Manipravalam, and one of my main arguments is that Manipravalam never died out after the Pūrvācāryas, so it wasn’t just revived in the 20th century or so. Of course, in the last century, we have had towering figures producing great works in a prolific manner, such as PBA Swami and Uttamūr Swami. But that doesn’t mean that there was a void between the Pūrvācāryas and the Ācāryas of the 20th century.

I had a look at the wonderfully useful *[History of Viśiṣṭādvaita Literature](https://archive.org/details/historyofvisistadvaitaliteraturevksnraghavan1979ocr)* by V. K. S. N. Raghavam (published in 1979), but although he mentions a few Manipravalam works, his focus is (unfortunately for me in particular) on the Sanskrit ones. We clearly need a bibliography of Śrīvaiṣṇava Manipravalam literature. Is there one already that I don’t know about? The early Ācāryas’ works are more or less well attested, but what is written after them is not, so far as I can see, except for the very popular ones. Let me think a bit.

For the Teṉkalai side, which probably used Manipravalam a little more than the Vaṭakalais did, we can mention Māmuṉikaḷ’s disciples and their descendants, including the very productive Piḷḷai Lokam Jīyar. The *arumpatavurai*s on the Īṭu *Bhagavadviṣayam* were composed by post-Māmuṉikaḷ Ācāryas. For the Vaṭakalai side, there is the *24,000-paṭi* subcommentary on Piḷḷāṉ’s *Āṟāyirappaṭi*. And then there were hagiographic works like the *3000-paṭi* Guruparamparāprabhāvam, the *Paḻanaṭai Viḷakkam*, the *Naṉ*ṉa*ṭai Viḷakkam* (does anyone have a copy of this, by the way?), and many such works.

How about the 18th-19th centuries? Who wrote during that time using Manipravalam? Who were the most important Ācāryas who wrote in this language? Has anyone worked on this and provided a list of author names and/or work names? Were the works composed during this time published? If so, how many of them have survived?

As for the 20th century, [this page](https://pbase.com/svami/srivaishnavascholarsvaikuntavasis), for example, tries to give a list of the most eminent Śrīvaiṣṇava scholars of the 20th-21st centuries belonging to both *kalai*s. The list (with photos) is, of course, inexhaustive. Here it is (warning: I have not fixed the spelling of the names here, but just copy-pasted from the original source):

What’s happened to all the works that these great scholars produced? Works of Puttūr Swami are still available at [Srivaishnavasri](https://srivaishnavasri.in) (more than what is listed on their website; you just need to WhatsApp Vasudevan Swami to enquire about the availability of certain books). And a few websites like [www.acharya.org](http://acharya.org/bk/index.php) host the PDFs of stalwarts like PBA Swami. [Archive.org](https://archive.org) has a few as well, though God knows we need to be lucky to be abe to find the scans at all, unless we try all possible (and impossible) combinations of letters that vaguely look like the word that we’re searching for. Uttamūr Swami’s descendants are bringing out again all his works, which is fabulous news. I just wish that they made them available online. Some websites like the one that’s been banned (Maran’s dog, I think) used to have tons of scans, but people worried about copyright breaches and the ensuing monetary loss put a stop to them. Now what? Are those books available for purchase as hard copies?

It’s wonderful to be “saving” the palm-leaf manuscripts, but not quite so wonderful to let early printed editions go extinct, as they are every single day. Do you know of anyone who has the scans of such works? Do they have a database that is accessible? While doing research for this article, I realised that it is easier to find many different editions of a medieval work than an important treatise written (and published) in my own times!
