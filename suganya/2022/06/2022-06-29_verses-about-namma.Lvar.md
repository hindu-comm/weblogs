Verses about Nammāḻvār

A few weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk on Nammāḻvār’s birthday (Vaikāci Viśākham). Since I barely had 4-5 days to prepare, it had to be informal, but it couldn’t entirely be un-academic, since I wouldn’t know how to go about preparing for that. So I decided to pick a few verses and enjoy reading them together with a small audience. Only, I thought that there are so many books, articles and talks that deal with Nammāḻvār’s verses, but not quite so many on verses *about* Nammāḻvār, which I have always found fascinating. So it was time to focus on this long-neglected secondary material on the Āḻvār.

There are at least three types of such verses, I think: 1) the formal ones, mostly *taṉiyaṉ*s (‘self-contained verses’), often by Śrīvaiṣṇava Ācāryas, recited before reciting the verses of the Āḻvār or talking about him/his work; 2) verses by presumably non-Vaiṣṇavas, non-Ācāryas, who have written *tālāṭṭu*s (lullaby) and what-not on him – fascinating, and needs further exploration; and finally, 3) the floating verses, my absolute favourites.

Let’s look at an example now. This following verse is attributed to a certain Karuvūr Cittar (clearly a Śaiva identity). And here’s the background story (no idea if there’s any written source for this, must be oral in nature): this person is said to have lived on the northern banks of the Tāmraparṇī in Āḻvār Tirunagarī (Nammāḻvār’s birth place). A dog befriended him. The creature used to cross the river, go to Āḻvār Tirunagarī to find food, and come back to him when done. One day, there were floods in the river, and as an aghast Cittar was watching, the dog was carried away by the floods. He also witnessed the soul leaving the dog’s body and climbing to Vaikuṇṭha. And thus a desperate verse springs out of his mouth:

*vāykkum kurukait tiruvītiy eccilai vāriy uṇṭa*

*nāykkum parama patam aḷittāy! anta nāyōṭ’ intap*

*pēykkum iṭam aḷittāl paḻutō? perumāṉ makuṭam*

*cāykkum paṭikkuk kavi-pāṭu ñāṉat tamiḻkkaṭalē.*

> You gave the Supreme Abode to the dog that ate up the leftover from > the sacred streets of the flourishing Kurukai!Will it be wrong to > give a spot for this fiend along with that dog? O ocean of erudite > Tamil who sings poems in such a waythat the Lord inclines \[His\] > crown!

Isn’t this a wonderful verse? The earthy feel that it comes along with is so raw, I think. Such a crisp way of stating the greatness and purity of Nammāḻvār’s town. And, we can also see that it is Nammāḻvār, not Nārāyaṇa, who grants liberation. How surprising can that be, if he can make Him bend before his verses?

Anyway, this was a 55+ minutes-long talk, in which I tried to accommodate as many poets as possible, whatever their backgrounds – I love them all. And although it is not a fully-fledged academic talk, it most definitely isn’t an *upanyāsam*, and not really meant for those who don’t know their basics (like, who Nammāḻvār and Madhurakavi were). You can watch the video here, if you’re interested in it despite the disclaimers:
