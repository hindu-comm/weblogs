Questions on Piḷḷai Perumāḷ Aiyaṅkār and Tatipāṇḍaṉ

I’ve been working on an article that deals with Tatipāṇṭaṉ, a famous character, at least known to those who listen to Tamil Vaiṣṇava *upanyāsam*s. This cowherd (or potter, depending on the versions) lived during the times when Kṛṣṇa was a child in Gokula. And one day, when Kṛṣṇa hides inside his pot to escape from His mother, Tatipāṇṭaṉ threatens to let Yaśodā know of His whereabouts or refuses to let Him out of the pot (depending on the version) unless He grants moksha not just to him, but also to his pot!

This story does not appear in any of the early Sanskrit texts (epics or Puranas), and not even in the Āḻvār poetry so far as I know. The first reference (more of an allusion, really) that I was able to trace is in Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Nāyaṉār’s *Ācāryahṛdayam*. And then Vedānta Deśika mentions it, and so does Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉi. And Aruḷāḷa Tācar develops the whole story in his Tamil retelling of the *Bhāgavata*. One of my questions is: are there any older references? Does the *Īṭu* mention it, for example? I’ve spent hours Googling and doing word searches, but I only come across red herrings, I think.

The other question concerns [Piḷḷai Perumāḷ Aiyaṅkār](http://acharya.org/ac/ppi/ppiv.pdf) (also known as Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Tācar), who has composed the very impressive collection of verses collectively known as the *Aṣṭaprabandham*, which includes the *Tiruvaraṅkattantāti*, *Tiruvaraṅkattu mālai*, *Tiruvaraṅka* *kalampakam*, *Śrīraṅga* *Nāyakiyār Ūcal, Tiruvēṅkaṭa mālai, Tiruvēṅkaṭattantāti, Aḻakar antāti* and the *Nūṟṟreṭṭu tirupati antāti*. He has also mentioned this Tatipāṇṭaṉ story, which is why I need to know more about his dates in order to incorporate him in my study in an appropriate way.

It seems that traditionally, he is believed to have been Tiruvaraṅkatt’ Amutaṉār’s son, and Paraśara Bhaṭṭar’s disciple (so roughly the 12th-13th centuries). However, which texts back up this claim? I’ll check the *Guruparamparāprabhāvam*, but any other texts (especially the earlier ones) that prove this? I’m asking this because, some scholars date him to the 17th century, so the difference is huge. The claim is that he worked for Tirumalai Nāyakkar.

Mu. Arunachalam doesn’t mention him in any of his books on the literary history of Tamil (9th to 16th, and a part of the 17th c.), and he can’t have missed such a prolific poet. Also, those who claim a later date do not cite any real evidence. This is something hinted at by the editors of the *Aṣṭaprabandham*, i.e. Vai. Mu. Caṭakōparāmānujācāriyār, Cē. Kiruṣṇamācāriyār and Vai. Mu. Kōpālakiruṣṇamācāriyār, all eminent scholars who have produced edition of the *divyaprabandham* as well). They don’t mention the Amutaṉār-Bhaṭṭar connection at all. Even the [Wikipedia](https://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/பிள்ளைப்_பெருமாள்_ஐயங்கார்) page suggests this later date, but does not give evidence.

So, does anyone know anything about this? I don’t have much time to look for evidence with Aiyaṅkār’s poetry, and can’t really accept his writing a verse for Kūrattāḻvāṉ as evidence for his early date. Or should I?
