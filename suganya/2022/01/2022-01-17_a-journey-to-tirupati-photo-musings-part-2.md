A journey to Tirupati – Photo-musings – Part 2

After leaving the ISKCON temple (see post [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/a-journey-to-tirupati-photo-musings-part-1/)), we headed to the next destination, which was barely 15-20 minutes away: Sri Perundevi Tayar Sameta Sri Varadaraja Perumal Temple ([here](https://goo.gl/maps/JGyU9cMTa8eNUEbS7)). It was a little temple that looked rather ancient (the walk in the outer *prakara* was a lovely experience), and decorated like the other temples, with flowers. Right in front, hiding the main shrines, was a mandapa with a large image of Andal, and a makeshift platform upon which Tiruppāvai upanysams must have been held (the sattumurai would have happened either earlier or later on that day), as the first of Tai marks the end of Markali (duh!).

It’s darker on this photo because I clicked it just before I left the temple

To the left immediately after entering is the Chakrattalvar sannidhi, which was quite busy at that time (I guess it was *pradosham* twilight, so no wonder). I walked around to visit the magnificent Yoganarasimha, before heading towards the main shrines. And if my memory serves me right, the shrine for the Tāyār and the main shrine are located next to each other. The Swami was smaller than the Kodanda Rama I had met on that day, but still looked splendid. And I noticed only after leaving the temple that Prathik had indicated that this place hosted the *tiruvaracu*s of the Jiyar Swamis. Drat! Missed that! I wouldn’t have noticed them in broad daylight, and now it was actually twilight, so not a chance of spotting anything unless it was clearly indicated. Anyway, to satisfy our not-so-spiritual hunger, some hot and tasty curd rice *prasadam* was offered us. Truly, a pilgrim never goes hungry so long as there are functioning Vishnu temples around. And as I washed my hand and left, I actually heard a lady tell the man who served, ‘*uppu ekkuvayindi, tagginchali* – it’s too salty, you must reduce salt’!). Try arguing with a woman on that point!

The next stop was the main temple of Govindaraja Swami, as a visit there would conclude the tiring day for us. But the driver left us on a side street, and plodding through it with the GPS telling me the way (and confusing me constantly by re-routing), I bumped into the back entrance of a small shrine. The *tiruman* on the wall suggested the Ahobila Matham, and a passing gentleman nodded his agreement. And indeed, it was a Lakshminrsimha shrine on the main street leading to the Govindaraja Swami temple. Since he heard that we are disciples of the *Srimatham*, the archakasvami asked if I was the person who came two days ago. Clearly, I must have a lookalike! Heading out and going the wrong way, I used the opportunity to get artificial garlands: the satisfaction did not lie in the purchase so much as it did in the bargaining, since I argued away in Telugu, thereby reducing the price by around 60 INR. Big deal!

The Lakshminarasimha shrine

The Hayagriva shrine

Within a few metres, I bumped into the Parakala Mutt’s Lakshmihayagriva shrine. The evening worship was reaching the end, and a Mami indicated that I should wait. So I got Sri sathari – tirtham as well. Wonderful! A few metres away, lies a shrine for Swami Deśikaṉ. Although the priest sitting outside nodded till I reached close enough to touch the Swami, I stayed back out, but it was a very good sevai in quasi-ekantam.

Not sure where this was, really, bad memory. Although it’s the first three Āḻvārs here

Now the queue was huge for the Govindaraja Swami temple. It would have put me off on an ordinary day, but during a pandemic, I simply decided to try again the following morning. Next destination: Sri Lakshmi Narayana Swamy Temple (located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/JGyU9cMTa8eNUEbS7)), on the Mada street, close to Govindaraja. It was pretty dark by then, but since the hotel was close by, no reason to give this temple a miss. I must sound clichéd and repetitive now, but this was also a truly beautiful temple, amply decorated with flower garlands and *torana*s. And so festive, with so many colours. I almost felt that this is somehow missing in the Tamil temples.

To the left of the Perumal, there is a shrine for Prativadi Bhayankaram Swami. How blessed to meet him! (Prathik had thankfully warned me of his presence there)

Photos above: It seems like it’s the newest trend to paint the *gopuram* in grey, and the figures upon them in yellow. Any reason why? Anyway, it was lovely to go around the *prakara* in the moonlight, although I didn’t quite manage to capture the actual beauty of the place. And my silly Samsung smartphone camera proved to be slow in focusing and producing photos that are rather meh. Prasanth later rubbed it in by saying that I should have picked an iPhone if I wanted good photos. Too late! Tant pis…

Anyway, to go back to the prakaras of this temple by moonlight… A couple sitting by the garbhagriha wall was applying tiruman kappu (apparently with turmeric and Srichurnam) to the lower layer of the wall. Some mrokku (vow), it must be? Who are they? What’s their story? What’s their mrokku and why? Another man was sitting there playing Chaganti’s (Telugu) upanyasam on his phone loud enough to be heard by the others. I suddenly felt transported to a different world, with different languages, sights, sounds, practices, although it was only a few hours’ drive from where I come from.

Since there was plenty of time at hand, I sat down in the mandapa to recite the Srirangagadyam (that was due for noon!), as a couple with two children chatting way in American English sat nearby. And another thing that overwhelmed and haunted me was the imposing presence of the door keepers Jaya and Vijaya, who had attracted my attention the moment I entered the mandapa, with all the marigold garlands adorning them. They look stern, but the ones I met later on at the Govindaraja Swami temple next door were positively smiling!

And then the march towards the hotel began, except that the back door of a shrine painted in orange caught my attention. Passing through it, I realised that its main door led immediately to the entrance of the Govindaraja temple where there was no trace of all the crowds I had witnessed previously. So depositing the phone (oh no!), we stepped in. The path had so many little shrines, of Ramanuja, Andal (I think).l and so on. A big, beautiful cow stood there with her calf, and stayed unruffled as the devotees touched her forehead and tummy and backside. Cool lady! We went round counterclockwise (!) Following a sign to find the entrance for the special tickets, when actually it was right in front (Bravo!). So, a handsome reclining Perumal graces the place, and we got a taste of the pushing of the devotees (actually, in one of the temples, a guy was telling everyone that once we get the darshan we should keep moving and not turn back to look at the Deity, as it’s simply not done. Yeah, right. Pull the other one, mate!) Next-door was Parthasarathi Perumal and another shrine which I forget. I got lazy and didn’t go to another shrine to the right, which was a huge mistake, as I remembered later that a seated Rama there was so handsome that Prathik had warned me He would steal my heart (as if it didn’t already belong to him, ha!). Well, clearly I have to go back another time!
