A journey to Tirumalai – Photo musings – final part

The second day (for day 1, see posts [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/a-journey-to-tirupati-photo-musings-part-1/) and [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/01/17/a-journey-to-tirupati-photo-musings-part-2/)) began rather abysmally for me without much sleep during that night. But no time for self-pity, Prasanth had arrived early, and we went to Alarmel Mangapuram (aka Tirucchanur) around 7:30 am, to visit the Goddess before we approach Her Husband on the hills, where our darshan time was fixed at 1 pm. The temple was fully and gorgeously decorated with marigold and other flower *torana*s (too bad we couldn’t take our phones with us, so no photos), and the crowd was very limited (apparently that’s quite incredible too). The Goddess looked very colourful, clearly with many layers of clothes. I offered flowers that were sold outside (two white waterlilies in whose centre two pink, flat roses were stuck!) and moved on. *Puḷiyotarai prasadam* (‘tamarind rice’) was unsurprisingly tasty, and made sure that we didn’t need to (at least some of us didn’t have to) worry about breakfast.

We visited a couple of other *sannidhi*s, and the Balaramakrishna was in a sitting position, with apparently both his hands pointing down. I asked the *archakasvāmi* (who, as Prasanth pointed out, was sitting in an almost similar seated position!) about that, and he said *kurchunnadu* (‘He is sitting’). Duh. I need to know more about this *murti.*

My mother had warned me that if I wanted to get *marapachi*s (knows as Kalahasti toys locally), then Alarmel Mangapuram was the place. Prasanth tried to bluff me by telling me that Tirumalai would have everything. Nah. Very few shops were open just then, and I wasn’t keen on getting scolded for asking the price and not buying anything, since I would likely be their *boni* (‘first customer’). Such a thing happened in my childhood in Tirumalai, and I wasn’t going to let that recur. One shop across the temple had a vast selection of *marapachi*s hidden away inside the shop, and they had Andal (her head was disproportionately big), Krishna (handsome!), and… the Venkatesvara-Padmavati couple! I wasn’t intending to get them, but finally did, because they looked so gorgeous, and because they would really be a good addition for this year’s Navaratri *golu*: last year, I learnt that in Andhra and Karnataka, they displayed this particular (dressed-up) couple in their *golu*s, so I had dressed the regular couple (known as Raja-Rani) like the V-P couple. This year, I’ll dress the real divine couple up!

Then some bargaining began in a Tamil-Telugu mixture, and we agreed on a price that was much less than what they initially quoted (which wasn’t half as high as the ones on Amazon for such products). I guess I was the *boni* and they were happy to have me buy a handful of things. The problem was: I didn’t want to part with my cash, the vendor didn’t accept cards, and our phones were deposited elsewhere so I couldn’t make payment via UPI. So the vendor did an incredible thing: he asked me to give whatever I would like to in cash (I gave him 500), and gave us his son’s phone number to make a UPI payment, and told us to send Rs 2100 via that number when we collected our phones and let his son know about the payment! He was actually so trustful as to let us go without paying for his goods! So obviously the pressure was on me till I made the payment, and his son couldn’t understand what was happening. He probably had a word with his father later on!

And then off to Tirumalai, because there were crowds near the Nammāḻvār Tīrtham, probably for the Kapilesvara temple. After getting thoroughly checked (and I thought we were actually catching a flight!), we started climbing (by car) the hills on a magical, misty morning.

Once we were above, we still had 3-4 hours before us. And Prathik had heartily recommended the Anantalvan tirtham, but after going round and round, and people indicating different places and the GPS having given up trying, I had to give up too. Clearly no luck with the Āḻvārs and the Acāryas in the present company. Next destination, the museum:

The museum is neither big, nor impressive, but it has a decent collection of sculptures + a few paintings/sketches by Bapu, who is a personal favourite of mine. Maybe I should write a separate post with the photos of the sculptures.

The Sudarsana (16th c.?) right at the entrance looked impressive!

Bapu’s Venkatesvara

After being done with the museum, I gave up other plans, and simply headed straight to the temple complex for just walking around and taking in the atmosphere. I had never seen Tirumalai so deserted!

the main temple, of course, on a cloudy day

A Hayagrivaswami temple

The Swami pushkarini, closed, hence deserted

Walking along the Swami Pushkarini, which was also deserted, we found a Hayagriva Swami sannidhi, but I was exhausted by then and couldn’t image climbing steps. So it was time to get some food and moving on. The place where we were served *annaprasādam* was nothing like what my memory threw at me! The place looked awesome and well-organised. Although it was a little scary to remove the mask, I didn’t have much of a choice…

The food was much better than than what they use to serve, the place much more hygienic and the service systematic. After food, we decided to try our luck by presenting ourselves at the entry point almost an hour before our assigned 1 pm. But before that, the mandatory visit had to be made to Varahasvami, the original owner of the hills, by the Swami Pushkarini.

And from there, our walk towards the main temple began, in the aptly named Supatha…

With relatively few people around, we were allowed to have an early darshan, after going through another round of checking during which we had to throw away our water bottles because plastic was not allowed inside! Of course, the rule seemed to apply only for bottles. Right. From then onwards, we just sprinted and trotted skipping all those caged places in which people were usually made to wait, sometimes for hours. And within 20 minutes we were at the entrance of the temple, where there was a bit of a traffic jam. I pulled out a book with the Srirangagadyam, and recited it trying not to miss a step. The crowd got slightly worse as we got closer, but oh boy! The place was filled with flowers! Positively flowery! So vey pretty! I just wished I could sit there and take the scene in, but no, life has become all about running and rushing. So be it.

After a bit of waiting and jostling (during which they let in “special” people, like a family of a CB-CID officer!), we had a 30-second darshan by sticking to the right side of the queue, which was both longer and more crowded, but whose route allowed a few extra seconds of darshan. The Lord was of course radiant, as usual, although we could not see Him from close quarters as we used to. But never mind, emotions caught up with me for various reasons.

Once outside the shrine, we were directed towards the Vaikuntha *vacal*, as it was barely two days after Vaikuntha Ekadasi (the path only open for a week in the year beginning from the Vaikuntha Ekadasi day). With a reclining golden Perumal gracing above the entrance door which everyone tried to touch to the annoyance of the guards, we entered the path, which is supposed to look like the Arciradi marga, I guess. What we had before our eyes (and noses) was a riot of flowers and colours and scents! Indian flowers, foreign flowers, big, small, red, orange, green, pink, green, you name it! The combined fragrance managed to tease our nostrils despite the stern N95 mask. And people had thrown money everywhere perhaps to show their joy. Or hoping that it would get them liberation. Or something else in this life.

Out of there, we got *laddu prasadam*, and then we could go outside the temple. As I stood waiting as Prasanth and my father went to get more p*rasadam*, two TTD staff members asked me, ‘What is it, Amma? Everything OK?’. I said yes, and they asked where I was from. Pondicherry. Then how do you speak Telugu? Learnt it by watching movies, I said, I’m Mahesh Babu’s fan! (A white lie can’t hurt, right). One of them looked exasperated (perhaps one woman too many mentioned being MB’s fan), while the other was enchanted. He said in an amused way that MB’s fan should not have to queue for so long, and that I should go to another shorter queue… How people appreciate it when you speak their language and show that you like their culture!

And then, it took a long while to get back our deposited phones, so I pulled out MAV Swami’s miniature editions of the *Nalayira Divya Prabandham* to recite verses related to Tiruvenkatam, but then remembered that the *adhyayana* period had not resumed. Not sure what to do, I just read them in my mind. When we got the phones back, we hopped into the car, and drove down the hills with a brief stop at the Hanuman temple on the way down.

The trees there looked so ancient, that I wished I could go explore them inside the forest. Probably better left off for another time. Anyway, we got back home safely, hoping to get another chance to go back soon!
