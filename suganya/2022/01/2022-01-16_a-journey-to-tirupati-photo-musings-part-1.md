A journey to Tirupati – Photo-musings – part 1

I hadn’t been to Tirumala-Tirupati for close to two decades. As a child, we went there every year, sometimes twice a year. But the last time I went there, it was so crowded and physically taxing that it left me frustrated and upset. Why go to a temple where you get trampled upon and you are annoyed with other people, and end up saying and doing things that are not right, especially within the premises of the temple? Surely, it’s better to stay home and long for a darshan, or go to a less crowded temple? That’s how I came to go to Srirangam every time I longed for Tirumalai (and no, I came to know only much later of the story of the Araiyar from Srirangam Periya Koyil wishing to go Tirumalai, who sang the *Amalan Ati Piran*, and ended up staying back). But as Prasanth insisted that I go there, I thought I should not resist anymore. And no regrets whatsoever!

A beautiful kolam! What we make in the cities, especially in apartments pale in comparison, truly!

My father and I left after celebrating Pongal, and it was an amazing experience to see all those wonderful, huge, and manifold kolams that women in the villages on our route had made in front of their houses, and the sides, and in every inch and corner at times.

We got to Tirupati in the afternoon (and Prasanth was supposed to join us on the following day). We were supposed to spend the night in a place close to the Govindaraja Perumal temple, which would therefore be our last destination for the day. Since there were a few hours to spare, and since Prathik made me a long and detailed list of places to visit with a Google Map to go with it, I set out rather immediately. First stop, a visit to “Prathik’s Rama”, a Kodanda Rama Swami temple, close to which he lived during his stay in Tirupati.

Swami Ramanuja

(If you need to reach there, [here’s](https://goo.gl/maps/S5p62R6gdeBzeAZS9) the location of Google Maps (for which you will have to thank him). This temple was well inside the town, and navigation was made smooth by the GPS, just like most other places around here.

I wished to get a fresh tulasi garland at the entrance, and as I haltingly asked the price in Telugu, the lady spoke in Tamil (“I spotted the Pondicherry registration plate of the car!). And as I paid for the garland, her husband insisted that I also visit a temple on the way to Kalahasti (which I wasn’t going to visit), where Perumal sat as Paramapadanatha, “like nowhere else in the world!” He almost made me promise to go there, and gave the name of the temple, which I unfortunately forgot to note down… Anyway, I entered the big temple which was nearly deserted and where it would have been impossible to waltz in so easily a day ago, as it was Vaikuntha Ekadasi. That, and perhaps Sankranti, had the whole temple decorated with flower *torana*s absolutely everywhere! Rama and His family stood taller than humans, beaming at us! While walking around the *prakara*, I found this Perumal standing there (see above), no idea why. A wonderful-looking Ramanuja was sitting in his own shrine, not far from Rama and co., and right across Periyalvar if I remember correctly.

The next destination was Srinivasa Mangapuram, which took us close to Alipiri (from where one has access to the hills). After half an hour drive, we reached there at 5:08 pm, and unfortunately, the cop on duty announced that it was *aradhanam* time from 5 to 6 pm, so visitors were not even allowed inside the temple. Drat! We turned back and headed towards the ISKCON temple. I came to know of its existence when I interacted with its members while giving a virtual talk at their interfaith conference in December.

It was a typical ISKCON temple, neat, not so crowded nor noisy, and with Krishna being the main Deity. In this place, He stands with Radha, and other Gopikas. Too bad I could not take photos, as they looked awesome! Except the ones below, of course (before one of the security guards waved madly at me to stop).

As I was looking for a *tulasimala*, I headed towards the shop (not that the visitors had a choice!). I found what I needed, plus what I didn’t “need” strictly speaking, although that’s a doubtful term to use in the context:

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/20220116_081429-min.jpg?w=766)

with the big brother!

He looks too serious to be Krishna, frankly!

Who can resist this face?

They do say that worshipping Krishna along with Balarama was an established practice mentioned in the *Cilappatikaram* (I think), especially Aḻakarmalai. And think of Puri Jagannath! So, obviously, I had to have the Brothers at home. And the other Krishna was just too Krishna-like to resist! While carrying out the transaction, I began speaking to the Prabhu there: we had started in Hindi, unconsciously switched to Telugu, before he asked me where I was from and declared that he was from somewhere near Chengalpattu. As I exclaimed that we could have talked in Tamil all along, he said in a very rusty Tamil that he had left the Tamil land over 50 years ago… But, the love for a “”compatriot”” made him add a dozen agarbatti packs to my bag as a compliment. Then, I mentioned Anuttama Prabhu who organised the event mentioned above, and his face cleared up. Yes, of course, he was from “foreign”, and was a “senior”, and they held the event in question in Tirupati for a few years. Are you initiated? He asks. Yup, but in the Srisampradayam. Another senior Prabhu, Balabhadra Das, came (I guess he is the head of the Tirupati centre) and spoke about that interfaith event organised there. Phone numbers were exchanged, and I took my leave.

The tummy started grumbling, and lo and behold! There was piping hot rice Pongal as *prasadam*! And the serving Prabhu looked at my *tiruman-kappu* and asked me if I was a Madhva! Nope, Sir, a Srivaisnava. He seemed happy enough with the answer. (I guess it’s because unlike the others, I use a yellow Srichurnam rather than red, which was picked by my Acharyan, who said I should use that colour – now people look strangely at my forehead even in the Srimatam!). As we got busy burning our tongue with the *prasadam* (the Krishna in their place must be made of sterner stuff than Namperumal to eat such hot food!), another Prabhu taking his walk and doing *japa* scrutinised my forehead, and I almost thought he would ask me if I was from the Nimbarka *sampradaya* or something. But thankfully, he went on with his *japa*.

To be continued…
