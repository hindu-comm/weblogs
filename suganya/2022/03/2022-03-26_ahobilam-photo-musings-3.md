Ahobilam photo-musings – 3

Day 2: After a warm day and a cool night, we set off early in the morning, and the green paddy fields with a misty hill backdrop was a soothing sight. Just what we needed before we started a day that we knew would be long, perhaps hectic.

As we approached the town, we saw that the temple car was all decorated now, with the deities placed inside (probably the night before).

before – after (back and front, though)

Since we knew that the temple car wouldn’t move without the Azhagiyasingar being present, and because we were invited to visit the *maṭha* for the *Viśvarūpadarśanam*, we went forth. Very few people were present, which is in stark contrast with how it is in Selaiyur, for example. We sat through the *goshti* and the *aradhanam* of Malolan, striking conversations with the *kainkaryapara*s (including one on the colour of my Śrīcūrṇam. Oh God!). After it was over, and before I could go through even a quarter of the *prasadam* (and I got two servings by the pampering Swamis who served, both of Pongal and of the fruits offered to Malolan!), Azhagiyasingar had finished performing *samasrayanam* for a devotee, and went straight towards the temple car. Leaving the *prasadam* to a beggar with much regret, I trotted behind the group. Such a privilege to be part of his retinue! We climbed up the stairs leading to the platform that was on the same level as the temple car, where Tirumankai Āḻvār and his wife Kumudavalli Nacciyar were paying their obeisance to the Lord who stood with His *ubhaya naccimar*.

Getting down the stairs still as a part of the retinue, I went close to the temple car as it was soon to leave. My mother had told me to just touch the ropes (*vaṭam*), and move away from the chariot (or whatever you call it). Prathik explained that the popular belief is that the temple car required its human *bali*, so better stay away.As it happens, I couldn’t stay close for too long anyway, as there just were too many people around me. And one of the policeman told me, ‘*Amma*, I don’t think you can’t stay here.’ He was right, of course, but he agreed when I said I would touch the *vaṭam* once it moves and then leave. But no, it just got too crowded form, so I made my escape without bothering about pretending to touch the *vaṭam* (a symbolical gesture that would replace the actual dragging of the ropes to make the car move).

Can you spot anyone with a mask there?

I tried to make a few photos of the moving car from upstairs, but there just were too many people. So we went back to the *maṭha*, which was swarmed by a local MLA and his retinue. After he left, we took the blessings of Azhagiyasingar, who inquired about us, and remembered me through my book on Kulasekhara Āḻvār (such a privilege to be associated in someone’s memory to an Āḻvār!). He asked us if we would visit the Garudasevai, and we said we would catch it on Upper Ahobilam (where it happened on that very night, a day before Lower Ahobilam).

We said goodbye and left to fill the bottles, when we realised there’s a *gośālā* at the back (why would that be surprising?). Mr Bull seemed to look down upon us as we didn’t have any treat for him.

(The following day, another huge Mr Bull walk past inside the *maṭham* office to the back making Prathik jump, as the locals barely batted an eyelid…)

Anyway, we wasted the next few hours doing nothing much worth mentioning here. The mobile network was jammed, as we later learnt, to prevent anything untoward from happening, which made communication even worse than it was. Anyway, Anna had arrived by then, and it was decided that we would visit 4 shrines on a jeep. So I chatted away with Chinna, the driver, who was mighty amused to know that I learnt Telugu from watching movies (not the full truth, but then, I never let the truth come in the way of a good story), and enchanted as I spoke NTR Jr’s dialogue from the film *Yamadonga*. I had just started watching *Pushpa* before leaving, and it apparently was set right in this area, so we asked him about the red sandalwood, and he pointed at a few specimens to us, and said that the only way to acquire any quantity was through illegal channels. Yikes.

The paths to Pāvana Narasimha were just as they were during my last visit over a decade ago, so the ride was quite bumpy. The shrine itself (below) was not too crowded, although people had started coming, often walking miles, with their family, and carrying or dragging domestic animals for offering them as sacrifice. I was so so grateful that it was Friday, and the sacrifices wouldn’t happen till the following day. Whatever anyone might say, I find the practice revolting, as I don’t believe in catching someone else (human or animal) and killing them for your own benefit. If you’re so keen on pleasing a deity with a *bali*, then offer yourself. Good riddance, I say! One of the men walked around with a scythe (probably for some other purpose at that moment, but for more nefarious ones on the following day), and he was kindness itself when he saw me all sweaty and tired, and suggested that I rest before I move. How can such compassion tolerate such violence?

The last time I visited here the priest had requested for some money to purify the place after the sacrifices took place. He did so this time too, although he gave no reason. Ah well.

Anyway, this shrine had two *mūlavar*s, one that the priest called *svayambhū*, and the other, *pratiṣṭhita*. Both held the Lady on their lap.. It was good to see them at close quarters. Later, when we mentioned a shrine for Chenchu Lakshmi, people pointed right and left, and said it’s close by and far, so we started climbing before realising we had missed a board, and were actually walking towards Upper Ahobilam! Ummmm.

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/img_20220318_154650-min.jpg?w=840)

So I just retraced my steps and quietly sat in the car, hoping that my headache would go, as we still had a long day, with the plan being that we would go to Upper Ahobilam for the night festival, during which Chenchu Lakshmi was going to steal something from Narasimha, who would then start chasing her, and then at least catch the beginning of the Garuḍa Sevai, as suggested by the *Maṭha* people (neither was to happen, for various reasons, the most likely being our stupid karma).

Our next stop was Bhārgava Narasiṃha, where dogs and monkeys seem to coexist more or less peacefully.

The *pushkarini* was in a sad state. If turning water bodies into garbage were to become a sport, we would be world champions! Anyway, we climbed up the stairs, accompanied by this lovely dog, and although the priest wasn’t there, the lady who sells flowers opened the outer doors for us. After a good *darśan*, we came down to learn from the driver that it was too late for the remaining two shrines. Well, too bad, From thereon, no point into getting into the details. Suffice it to say that after a couple of chaotic hours, some of us simply called it a day.
