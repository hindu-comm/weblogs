On Kulaśekhara Āḻvār and Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār

As it is the *vārṣika tirunakṣatram* of Kulaśekhara Āḻvār today, I thought I should write something on him. But what? I hope that I have written everything there is to write about him (forgive the academic’s megalomania once again!) But then I realised that while looking into who was influenced by his poetry, I have only focused on Kampaṉ so far. But surely there are other people? Yes, there are. Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār, for one.

As I indicated in [my previous post](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/03/12/questions-on-sri-as-an-acarya-and-a-mediator/), I’m writing an article on him, which will include a translation of his twin-poems. And without even looking very carefully, I was reminded of the Āḻvār when I simply skimmed through Aruḷāḷar’s verses. Interesting. Let’s have a look at this verse by the Āḻvār (*Perumāl Tirumoḻi* 5.4):

NB: I made this translation five years ago: I don’t know that woman anymore, and I don’t endorse her translation anymore, so do be warned!

So, a person who is in need of a surgery will absolutely love the surgeon who will cut him up, rather than be afraid of or angry with him. Similarly, the poet will keep looking for God’s grace, even if He gives him suffering. For, surely, that suffering must have a good reason, besides being beneficent to the Āḻvār in the long run. A very nice verse that presents the concept of total and unquestioning surrender. Clearly, Kulaśekhara isn’t one to rant, the way that I do when I get a couple of problems…

Now, Aruḷāḷar seems to be inspired by this idea as well. He writes that Nārāyaṇa (the Husband of Śrī) is like a father who will allow a surgeon to cauterise a wound that is on his son’s body, he says, because He has the child’s wellbeing in mind. The child might resent his father for his decision, might consider him cruel, but of course, the intentions are good, and the long-term results will be good too.

On another occasion, the Āḻvār writes that nothing can replace the sun for the lotus, not even the warming fire; similarly, no other deity can melt his heart, even if the Lord of Vittuvakkōṭu rejects him:

(same disclaimer as above!)

Now, Aruḷāḷar does something interesting here: he borrows elements from the comparison (God = sun, devotee = lotus), and takes it further, by declaring that if the lotus is not in the pond (=Ācārya), then the very same sun would burn the lotus = God might be too harsh towards a devotee without the protection of the Ācārya, because a *jīvātman* has been breaking all the divine rules for millions of births and accumulating much karma in the process. Isn’t that a clever way of introducing the topic of the Ācārya’s role and importance?

Gosh, if I said more on Aruḷāḷar’s poetry, there would be no point in publishing it! Anyway, as you can see, Kulaśekhara Āḻvār influenced many poets and philosophers for centuries . And I, for one, always enjoy spotting such an influence. Do you know of any other such work (except for the *Mukundamālā*, of course, which anyway I don’t think he wrote)?

PS: if you want to read my outdated translation of Kulaśekhara Āḻvār’s *Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi* and Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai’s translation, you will find it [here](https://www.academia.edu/39068941/My_Sapphire_hued_Lord_my_Beloved_Perumāḷ_Tirumoḻi_and_of_its_Medieval_Maṇipravāḷa_Commentary_by_Periyavāccāṉ_Piḷḷai_with_an_Introduction).
