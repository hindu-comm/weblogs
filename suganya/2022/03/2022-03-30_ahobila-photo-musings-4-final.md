Ahobilam photo-musings – 5 (final part)

So the last day of our trip (19/03) came, and since we were not to leave Tirupati till 9:30 am, Prathik and I decided that we would visit the Govindaraja temple, and any other temple within the 3-hour frame that we had. So at 6:30 am, we were off to see Govindaraja by foot, because the temple was barely a kilometre away.

After a good *sevai* of all the deities, we wondered whether to try Srinivasa Mangapuram, that one temple that I had missed visiting last time I was in Tirupati, in January.

But time was short, so we went to the Lakshmi Nārāyaṇa temple close to the Govindaraja one, where I enjoyed walking around the *prākāra*, this time by daylight.

From there, we caught an auto to go to the Kodanda Rama temple, where Rāma was garlanded like Venkatesvara this time. Gorgeous! It seems they had just undone the temple car, for all these different parts were lying on the floor. I found them irresistible!

How to be remembered around a century and a half later…

From there we went to Govindaraja again, as I had to get a few garlands made of fabric. I tried to bargain for the small ones, but the salesperson said they barely made any profit on those. I didn’t believe him, but I let it be. While I had proudly conjured all the Telugu I knew in order to bargain, I realised that he spoke to the owner of the shop in Tamil! They were originally from Tamilnadu. So all my efforts lay wasted! (The same happened later at Nārāyaṇavanam, where I got a saree. The vendors replied to me in Telugu and spoke in Tamil among themselves! Sigh).

A pity this Vedānta Deśika shrine was closed

Anyway, we jumped inside the car and left towards Kanchipuram. On the way, we stopped at the Kalyāṇa Venkatesvara temple in Nārāyaṇavanam, where Venkatesvara is said to have married Padmāvatī. He stands holding a shiny arrow in hand. This was the only place where the policemen wouldn’t let me in without a mask, and where they were strict about not allowing photography. Well, they can always try! I think that there was an important family participating in what seemed like a private Kalyāṇotsavam of the *utsavamūrti*s, who were all still in *sērtti sēvai*.

And just before we reached Kanchipuram, close to Arakkonam, we made a little detour following Prathik’s suggestion to visit an interesting little temple that lies in ruins in Tirumālpur. The setting was wonderful, with paddyfields and so many palm trees surrounding it. The farmers were busy harvesting, and the scent of freshly-cut stems pervaded the whole area. Heaven for someone who lives in a concrete jungle and hardly goes out, especially since the beginning of the pandemic! The setting was idyllic and inviting, but I hardly think that life there would be easy for those who do live there.

Anyway, here’s the temple, known as Konar Koyil (cowherds temple) once dedicated to Viṣṇu. It is now under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It is made of some kind of greenish stone, and it was probably built during the Pallava-Cola transition period (to know more about its history, you can check [this website](https://tamilnadu-favtourism.blogspot.com/2021/06/konar-temple-thirumalpur-history.html), although I’m sure there are more scholarly options). And it bears many lovely carvings…

But also inscriptions: the earliest seem to belong to Parāntaka I, but there were also my favourite Rājarāja I’s! But it was the ones in Grantha + Tamil that fascinated me most, for obvious reasons. (Oh, and Prathik says that one of them quotes a *pācuram* that is not part of the *Nālāyira Divya Prabandham*! – Curiouser and curiouser!)

The main deities are found inside the shrine, although badly damaged.

Clearly this gem of a place requires more time to explore it properly, and we didn’t have much of that. So I just clicked photos frantically, of the place and its surroundings, very happy to have made a stop there. I wonder: what is the story of the temple? Who built it? Why there? Did the Āḻvārs visit it? Why was it allowed to fall into ruins? I just so wish that these would be turned into places of worship again, and not merely museums, because that’s what they were built for!

Immediately after leaving the place, we came upon this swamp-like place that had so many white waterlilies, and other aquatic plants, that I had to jump out of the car and take more photos. Most satisfying! At Kanchipuram, Prathik left us, and we drove on till Pondy chatting away. That was an interesting trip!
