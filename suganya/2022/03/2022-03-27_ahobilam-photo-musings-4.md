Ahobilam Photo-musings ‚Äì 4

Knowing that we were to leave Ahobilam in the morning, it felt awful not to have visited the Upper Ahobilam shrine, especially since it transpired from our conversations the day before that it was likely to be the older shrine, which Tirumankai sang about. To come all the way to such a far-off place and not visit the Divyadesam shrine? Not done! Prathik and I had planned to walk down from our recently found hotel to the shrine in lower Ahobilam to watch the Suprabhata Sevai. But I sent him a message asking him if we could just slip away to Upper Ahobilam and be back before 8:00 -8:20 am, which we thought was the time we all sort of had agreed upon the day before. He replied saying that he had the same thought. So off we went.

After waiting at the wrong place for some time, we had the sense to ask a sugarcane vendor nearby, who pointed at the bus station. Thankfully! We found the right bus, which started moving immediately after we sat down. It was a cool morning, and we started chatting about various things as the bus went up in circles (probably not, but that‚Äôs the impression I got). As we reached Upper Ahobilam, we still had to walk uphill to reach the shrine (it seems the Devasthanam bus, which was also free and crowded for that reason, takes us closer to the entrance). People had slept everywhere, perhaps after the Garudasevai, so they could be seen en brushing their teeth, washing themselves, and doing whatever one does in the morning. There were hundreds and hundreds of them. Anyway, we reached the shrine, and got special entrance tickets as it seemed crowded and time was scarce for us.

As Prathik started singing, we had a very good sevai of Narasimha Swami, but also a magnificent one of Adiva·πá Sa·π≠hakopan, the founder of the Ahobila Ma·π≠ha (and Annamayya‚Äôs Acharyan) ‚Äì although I have been to this shrine before, I simply didn‚Äôt remember seeing the original *m≈´rti* whose photos are circulated so abundantly! That was my a-ha moment! We then slipped out, and caught the bus that took us down. Back at the hotel, after some silliness, we set forth towards our next destination.

This was Bhairava Kona, with pre-Mahendra carved shrines for ≈öiva. Had I been on my own, I would not have given this place a second thought, too much travel in the heat, too much hassle for someone like me who had minimal interest in the place (a Vai·π£·πáava textual scholar). But in a group, you follow the herd, and glad enough that the others were happy about the place. Such a philistine I must be! Yikes! Nonetheless, let me just share a few shots, which were all bound to be meh anyway, simply because of the harsh midday light. And no comments added, as I don‚Äôt have any to make, except that the setting was beautiful, although the sun was scorching.

gWe reached this other no-man‚Äôs-land after 4:30ish hours of travel from Ahobilam. We stayed there for about an hour and some more, and then left towards Tirupati (another 4:30ish hours‚Äô travel away), where we were planning to spend the night. After a few hours of travel, chatting and singing, we reached Vontimitta, which hosts a vast, attractive RƒÅma u htemple that was built around the Vijayanagara period, with hundreds of fascinating carvings. It is presently under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India, with a pretty, manicured garden to speak for it üòÄ The popular belief is that the famous Telugu poet Bammera Potana lived here and composed his *BhƒÅgavatamu* here, and that even Annamayya visited this place. This was my second, unexpected meeting with RƒÅma and family here, and wouldn‚Äôt mind visiting them again and again!

Here‚Äôs a very short video so that you get a feel for this place, which we left for Tirupati later on, ready to call it a day.
