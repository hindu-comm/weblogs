Questions on Śrī as an Ācārya and a mediator

Śrī-Lakṣmī is an important figure for the Śrīvaiṣṇavas, who, after all, get part of their denomination due to the fact that they worship Nārāyaṇa along with Śrī (there might be other reasons, which I won’t get into here). Her nature and role have been the subject of debates over the centuries: is She an *aṇu* like the other *jīvātman*s or *vibhu* like Bhagavān? Can She be the means to liberation, or is She just a facilitator? Those interested in these discussions can read, for example, chapter 7 of Patricia [Mumme’s book](https://archive.org/details/svtd_pm). Of course, how She is perceived by the Ācāryas varies from one Ācārya to another. Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, for example, simply adores Her, in the form of Periya Pirāṭṭi-Raṅganāyakī Tāyār, and His *Śrīguṇaratnakośam* contains fabulous praise for Her.

What I’m interested in here, however, is how Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār’s twin poems make of Śrī, as I’m gearing up to finish the loooong article that incorporates a full translation of them both. In his *Jñānasāram*, She is always present in Nārāyaṇa’s names and epithets (e.g. the Lord of Kamalā, etc.), but doesn’t do much. Or say or think much. At least, She’s not seen doing anything. However, in the *Prameyasāram*, She is barely visible at all. And the first verse even seems to replace Her with the Ācāryas, both figures who are understood by some as some kind of mediator/go-between later on:

*a- āṉavarkku ma- āṉavar ellām u- āṉavar aṭimai eṉṟ’ uraittār* (PS 1) –

“The*u*-people (Ācāryas?) have stated that all the*ma*-people (*jīva*s) are the servants of the*a*-Person (Nārāyaṇa).”

(Ok, I know, the translation is weird, but so is the original verse. And I don’t see why I would spare the English-speaking reader all the weirdness contained in the original text). Anyway, when analysing the meanings of the *praṇava* (*aum*), the Ācāryas suggest that *akāravācyo bhagavān* = Bhagavān is represented by the syllable *a*, while the *jīvātman*s by *ma*, while *u* is the meditator, often understood as Śrī, but apparently also as the Ācāryas – basically, anyone who takes the *jīvātman* to the *Paramātman*, convincing the latter to accept the former.

Now, **my questions** are: is this a typical Śrīvaiṣṇava interpretation, or do other Sampradāyas also adopt it? And when is the first time that this interpretation is written down? Which text? Any ideas at all?

Also in *a- āṉavarkku ma- āṉavar ellām u- āṉavar aṭimai eṉṟ’ uraittār*, the *āṉavar* is a participial noun (from the root *ā* ‘to be, to become’) in the 3rd person honorific, which could either be taken as a plural (e.g. *ma*-people), or as a respectful 3rd person singular (e.g. *a*-Person). The question is: is *u- āṉavar* singular or plural? Who does it refer to if it’s singular (because I don’t think that the honorific form was used for women till the modern period)? The medieval commentator Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉikaḷ takes it to mean the Ācāryas.

So where has Śrī gone if it’s a reference to the Ācāryas? Is She totally replaced? Or was She never before Aruḷāḷa Perumāḷ Emperumāṉār’s time associated with *u*, so that the question of replacement doesn’t rise at all? Could it be that the poet includes her in the list of Ācāryas? We know that She is considered as the 2nd Ācārya in the *ācārya paramparā*, the first being Nārāyaṇa, and the first human Ācārya being Nammāḻvār, and then Nāthamuni, etc. **When was this *ācārya paramparā* including Śrī first attested**? Prathik pointed out to me that a few Ācāryas of the lineage are mentioned in Yāmunācārya’s *Stotraratnam*, but where do we first get a fully-fledged list of them all? I’m thinking of the taṉiyaṉs, especially *lakṣmīnātha-samārambhāṃ nāthayāmuna-madhyamāṃ* \| *asmad-ācārya-paryantāṃ vande guruparamparām* \|\|, attributed to Kūrattāḻvāṉ (Kūreśa). Is that the first written evidence that we find?

Is there anything else of import that I need to know here? Any interesting books on the topic? Although I must say that I’m running out of time and energy for this particular article, another super lengthy one… At least I hope that it will be super useful for future research (Please bear with an academic’s megalomania).
