Ahobilam photo-musings – 2

To continue towards the lower Ahobilam temple at the end of Day 1 ([here’s](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/03/21/ahobilam-photo-musings-1/) the first post of the series if you have missed it): I hear from the experts that worship at this temple is older (and perhaps not attested in the old texts such as the *Divya Prabandham*) than the one in Upper Ahobilam.

The dvajastmabha, which is understood to represent the Ācārya lineage

The temple is beautiful though, with sculptures from the Vijayanagara period (if I’m not wrong). Here are a few shots (and only photos, as someone like Prathik will be more competent to describe them properly):

The Rāma sannidhi

My personal favourite, though, is this one of a gleeful Narasimha courting a shy Chenchulakshmi. I adore that grin on His face that the sculptor has caught so very well!

A day later, as we were travelling for hours with some time to kill, I composed a verse on this Couple based on the first verse of the *Tiruvāymoḻi.* Here it is for those who missed it, and my own translation (Disclaimer: both are meh):

Anyway, to come back to the temple, the last time I went there over a decade ago, it was just a sleepy place (I bet it has gone back to that mode right now, as I’m typing these words), very peaceful. But during the *Brahmotsavam*, obviously, the place was teeming with people and bustling with activity, like this *puṟappāṭu* – probably it wasn’t even one. They just took the Swami and the Ubhaya-Nāccimār from inside to the *maṇḍapa*, before taking them to the temple car stationed about half a kilometre away.

It was wonderful to get *sevai* of these deities, but on a more materialistic note, I promised myself that I would get a saree just like the one that the Ladies were wearing! After visiting the Handsome Man-Lion inside, and the Tāyār, as Prathik broke out in a song (actually, it was song after song after song as he approached the deities: I had the distinct feeling that people were so awestruck that they didn’t even push us around, not even the officials inside the shrines, and one lady even asked him to resume the songs, and he happily obliged).

As we came out, we noticed this cousin keeping very busy at the *dvajastambham*.

And then, as we left the temple with the falling night, to find our way to the parking lot, which was a couple of kilometres away (next to which various *maṭha*s were making massive quantities of free food), I realised that my walking shoes, which I had left at the entrance of the temple, were gone! ‘That means your *daridram* is gone, Akka, that’s what my grandmother used to say!’ consoled Prathik (and later on, when I mentioned the theft of shoes to a curious lady, she exclaimed ‘*Bhāgyam*!’). I hope that’s the case, I can do with that kind of loss!

From there we went to the Ahobila Mutt that is at the end of the road, to know when I could visit the Maṭha and our Azhagiyasingar. They said we could do just then (but no, I wasn’t in *svarūpam*, i.e. not in an appropriate form), so it was to be the following morning. They said I could attend the *Viśvarūpa darśanam* at 6:30 am, and then join Azhagiyasingar’s retinue towards the temple car. Perfect plan! The *maṭha* people (after saying that I should appear in *svarūpam* the following day), fed us with rice *upma* and buttermilk, and allowed us to fill our water bottles. Good, it was now time to get new sandals for me: Prathik said I wouldn’t be able to walk on those hot streets on the following day (it was over 40 degrees Celsius in the afternoon!). Except that a lady who came out of the *maṭham,* said to us that there was going to be a *puṟappāṭu* (procession) of the deities ‘5 minutes’ (I guess it was more like 30-45 minutes). The very ones that we saw earlier on, as I would learn later. She said she came all the way from Āḻvār Tirunagari (O.M.G! And I thought our trip was long and tiring!), and proudly stated that her Ācāryan was Emperumanar Jeeyar (I think I’m missing a part of the name here). As there was no sign of the *puṟappāṭu*, we left in search for new shoes, and an *uttarīyam* for Prathik if he were to visit the *maṭham* on the following day. Both items were acquired, and then some more…

I had never been to a village fair before, and not even an important festival like a *brahmotsavam*. I have always been very reluctant to place myself among crowds. So this was all quite an experience. The atmosphere was so vibrant, there were hundreds of makeshift shops, thousands of people, so many colours and smells, with songs blaring across the place. I guess the memories will stay long with me. Anyway, this was only the beginning of the adventure…
