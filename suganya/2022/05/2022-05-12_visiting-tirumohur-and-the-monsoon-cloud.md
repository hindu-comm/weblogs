Visiting Tirumohur and the Monsoon Cloud

After visiting Narasimgam (narrated [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2022/05/07/a-visit-to-narasingam/)), we went to the nearby Tirumohur, where I hadn’t been in decades. But this time I wanted to, because I had heard that the Swami there, known as *āttaṉ* (\< Skt. *āpta-*) aka *vaḻittuṇai perumaḷ* (‘fellow-traveller Perumāḷ’), is the one who will accompany the newly-liberated soul in its journey towards Vaikuṇṭha. Of course, at a more popular level, the temple is known for the Cakrattaḻvār (Sudarśana) depicted with 16 arms and with mantras inscribed on them apparently, whom people visit for various things (better luck with business, marriage, you name it!) No doubt that he looks awesome, but it is so much fun to get acquainted with a travel-fellow though…

This poster which promises that the *arcanai* will be done in “Mother Tamil” (so no choice offered to the devotee) – politics greeting us right at the entrance. Oooh. I have always been tempted to show a Caṅkam verse to the self-proclaimed “pure Tamils” who want to change how the temples function and turn them “secular” (but not other places of worship) and ask them to tell me what it means. A pure Tamil ought to be able to read Tamil verses, right? But I guess that would be a criminal waste of my own time. And, this paragraph was uncalled-for, just an allergic reaction to something that annoys me intensely. Politics? No, thanks. I should mind my own business.

Reaching the main shrine, I noticed a couple of life-sized statues bathed in turmeric and obviously objects of worship. By getting closer, I saw that it was the Manmatha-Rati couple placed on either side half facing the main shrine, in the mandapa (see photos above). Why would anyone want to worship them?? Wasn’t the guy decimated by Śiva? And how are they supposed to help you anyway? By making the person you’re in love with fall for you? Dubious means, I’d say.

The main Deity Himself was absolutely gorgeous (I think the priests opened one shrine after another so that an NRI family could visit them – what good timing for us country bumpkins!) – Kāḷamēka Perumāḷ, the Monsoon Cloud, stood with His two consorts flanking Him. Here’s a photo that I obtained from the Internet:

The *utsava-mūrti*, named Āttaṉ, also looked particularly lustrous and welcoming. Which of the two is going to be my travel buddy? (and which text actually mentions this? I only know of the Ātivāhikas and the Amānava keeping company during the final journey). After getting a *tulasi-mālai* as *pradāsam* (which I offered my own Rāma at home, although the poor old tulasi was dried up when I did so a few days later, especially during this horrible heatwave), we headed towards the Tāyār shrine. Too crowded, so I went beyond that shrine, to find Cakrattāḻvār’s shrine right behind. How often do we have such a structure inside a temple? Anyway, impressive-looking he was too, as did the Yoganarasiṃha carved on his back. With the crowds sticking to the other shrine, where the arcaka-svāmi was making an elaborate *arcanai*, I picked out my phone and made these not-so-good photos:

I then went round in the *prākāra*, just catching the sounds of the birds getting back home, calling it a day. I have a similar video from Śrīraṅgam, and I find it absolutely enchanting. While there’s a certain chirpiness in the morning calls of the birds, as best described by Āṇṭāḷ, I find the evening one very charming and soothing.

The tranquility of the place (other than the chirping of the noisy, excited birds) is a boon for those constantly living surrounded by noise. I wish I had more time to sit and listen and also to explore the different parts of the temple itself and the carvings, but night was falling, and I would soon not be able to see much in half an hour’s time. So I kept walking.

This is the Āṇṭāḷ shrine. I guess my phone got itself into some other mode, so the photos definitely look very different from the dud ones that it was making before

The Āṇṭāḷ shrine was as usual small, and Āṇṭāḷ looked really pretty too. But I didn’t dare take a photo this time, as a Hare Kṛṣṇa lady devotee sat there with her *japamālā* keenly watching me,as her lips were uttering the mantras. The last thing I wanted was a sharp rebuke from her, so I continued walking, finished my circumambulation but continued walking on to catch up with the Tāyār, now that the crowd had moved on.

I noticed the Āḻvārs and Ācāryas this time, in the prākāra leading to the Goddess’s shrine, and Svāmi Rāmānuja caught my attention, wearing his bright *kāṣāya*, probably it was barely a few days before his *jayantī*, I guess. There must have been special festivities taking place.

The Goddess

After a visit to the Goddess, it was time to leave. I realised that there was another *prākāra* (I think) outside, where there was a shrine for Hanumān to the right as we come out of the main temple (I remembered APN Swami mentioning that only Bhagavān (of course), the Nityasuris or the muktātmās should have shrines built inside the temple, not the living ones – and Hanumān, of course, is thought to be still around, being a *cirañjīvi*).

![](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220428_181737.jpg?w=762)

It was quite an experience visiting this shrine here, as the *arcaka-svāmi* started reciting a verse from Kulacēkara Āḻvār’s *Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi*, *uṇṭiyē uṭaiyē*. Talk of coincidences! He gave me a five-minute explanation of the verse, saying how people run after food, nice clothes and fun, and forget to do the essential, which was worshipping God. Well, clearly the Āḻvār was winking at me!

Once outside, I got to see another angle of the place, the sculptures, the *gopura*, which did not look in very good condition to me. When you see centuries-old sculptures drilled to hold a nail, your heart does tend to bleed. How did we end up being such philistines that can’t appreciate art or respect those who produced it centuries ago?

As I started walking towards where the car was parked to the left (by the way, to the right of this temple as we leave it, on the opposite side, there’s a pair of marvellous shrines for Rāma and Narasiṃha next to each other!), I was met with this calf, who hoped I probably would give that *tulasi-mālai* that I was holding as a snack. Sorry baby! Nope. (For some reasons, I have always been stared at by calves. God knows if they stare at everyone or if it is just me, and why the hell?)

The sun was setting and this lovely (but not-so-pristine) pond glittered in that soft evening sunlight. Was it lotuses or waterlilies that adorned it? It didn’t matter. Nammāḻvār would have found the place as transcendent as the Lord inside, even if it had just been a tiny shrine back then, next to such a lovely pond. So long, Āttā!
