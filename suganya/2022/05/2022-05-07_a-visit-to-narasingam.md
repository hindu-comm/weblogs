A visit to Narasingam

Located about 16 km away from Madurai, this village is best known for its Narasimha temple, as its name indicates. The Anaimalai hills that host it, also house the *tiruvaracu* of Piḷḷai Lokācārya (about which I have written [here](https://suganyasmusingsscribblings.wordpress.com/2020/12/28/the-tiruvaracu-bndavanams-of-the-srivaiava-ascetics-2-piai-lokacarya-in-jyotikui/)), as well as Jain temples at the top with bas reliefs (which I’m yet to discover). The temple is a rock-cut one and was built by the Pandya kings around the 8th century (according to Wikipedia!). Curious that none of the Āḻvārs sang about it! And a pity.

Earlier on the day of my visit, we finished reading *Tiruvāymoḻi* 2.4.1 in the *Bhagavdbiṣayam kālakṣepam* (1):

The Swami had taken three sessions to explain the verse briefly (!!), a mission that was made difficult by the fact that Nampiḷḷai had extensively quoted from the *Rāmāyaṇa*, which seems to be the Swami’s absolute favourite! Anyway, the *cāttumurai* of the verse was done just before 4:30 pm, when *pradoṣam* was going to begin. So I jumped into the car and headed towards Narasingam to visit Narasimha precisely during *pradoṣam.*

As we approached Anaimalai hills, the place began to look refreshing, away from the bustle of the city, and plenty of trees and swamps and what not to be seen and felt.

A waterlily pond from which I had tried to get bulbs during my last visit

After reaching the temple I got flowers (which cost much more than in Pondicherry, and the vendors actually ask you if you’re from Chennai, because the locals simply pay 50 rupees per *muḻam*, outrageous!!), and remembered not to get *tulasi*, which is not be bought, according to my Acharyan.

Apart from the main shrine for Yoganarasimha (Wikipedia calls Him Ugranarasimha. Perhaps), which you can’t circumambulate because it has the hill for its back, being an extension of sorts, there is also a shrine to the left as we enter the temple of a gorgeous-looking Goddess, and a mandapa to the right.

This was my third visit to the temple: the first time was over a decade ago. I distinctly remember my Pondicherrian cousin ranting about not get whatever bonus he deserved to, and hoped that Narasimha there would give him that. Gosh! He went on and on right outside the *garbhagriha*. It reminded me of the parallel of approaching an emperor to ask him for 10 rupees! He wouldn’t let anyone focus at all. Anyway, I think we were allowed closer to the *mūrti* back then, and I somehow remember His being huge, over 2,5 of metres tall. Then, when I visited three years ago, He seemed about half that size. And now, He seemed smaller than that. Either being allowed a glimpse from far off has played tricks on my eyes, or else He is showing Himself in different sizes to me, as some people would tell me!

Perhaps since it was *pradoṣam,* the *utsava mūrti* was placed in the *maṇḍapa*, fully bedecked and glorious-looking. And guess what? The arcaka-svāmi recited the *āṭi āṭi* verse while doing the *hārati*! Such perfect timing! I asked him if I could take a photo, and the answer was unsurprisingly no. He said that I would be caught on the camera and the photo would be deleted by the people outside (of the HR&CE??). That I should buy a plastified one at the stall outside. I then visited the *mūlavar*, offering Him some *tulasi*, which had miraculously found its way into the plastic basket that the flower-seller had lent me: I thought that she had kindly left some for free, but it turns out that it was the *prasādam* given by the arcaka-svāmi outside! Good thing that the tulasi could be offered more than once!

Later on, as I stepped out I asked the guy at the stall if I could buy photos, and he said he had no stock. So I asked him how they could stop me from taking photos when they couldn’t even supply me with copies. He said I should search for a photo on the Internet, there are plenty there (really? He should teach me how to use the Internet! Ah well, I had to do that in the end! See below).

I replied that it would never be the same as my own photo. And the simpleton tells me that the Lord’s power will be reduced with the number of photos that are taken!! I rubbished his claim (which I had heard before), and he insisted that only last week a Jeeyar Swami said that. I would definitely like to meet that Swami (who possibly didn’t make any such idiotic claims) so that he could explain to me how the Lord whom he must consider as the Supreme Being, the the Creator of the worlds, powerful beyond imagination, to be reduced to a dainty statue whose powers would be reduced by a man-made *acit…*

Arguing and grumbling, I lifted my phone in defiance and made photos of the wooden portals that looked impressive and with fine carvings.

I then stepped out to go for a quick look at my favourite lotus pond, which was covered in pink blooms during my last visit on morning in March, but which was without any flowers at all now (maybe they had harvested them for the day, as it seems to be big business now).

I hesitated to go too close, as there were monkeys on the trees by the side, and also a dog by the flower-seller, but it was amusing to see the monkeys getting so close and Man’s best friend trying to catch them by jumping up towards the trees!

PS (1): By the way, if you would like to know more about this verse and discover what the medieval commentaries have to say on that particular verse, you can watch my talk here, which I gave virtually at the University of Madras, for the Department of Vaishnavism last October:
