Kāverī, Śrīraṅgam and mokṣa

While reading a passage from the *Āṟāyirappaṭi Guruparamparāprabhāvam*, the beginning of Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār’s *vaibhavam* to be precise, I came across an interesting sentence that praises the greatness of the Kāverī – actually, it is interesting that the lifestory of this particular Āḻvār should begin not with his own birth, but rather with the *sthalapurāṇa* of Uṟaiyuṛ, his birth place, which narrates how Śrī was born to the Cōḻa king who ruled from that city, and how she married Namperumāḷ. Not sure why this is the case. But I digress.

The passage begins by naming the city (Uṟaiyūṛ-Nicuḷāpurī), which is a great place because it is located on the banks of the Kāverī. The river so auspicious and purificatory that one doesn’t even need to touch her water: even being touched by the breeze that touched her water can do no less than grant liberation! It’s per se nothing extraordinary. All *sthalapurāṇa*s extol places, people and what-not, to the sky. They apply the *nahi nindā nyāya* sometimes by even belittling comparable entities. But why do I find it interesting? Aren’t there also claims that being born and dying in and around a radius of 30+ km of Śrīraṅgam confers *mokṣa*? (And I remember the days when I used to fume, thinking of some of the horrible people who pestered others throughout their lives who died nor far). So what’s the big deal?

Well, because it is the Śrīvaiṣṇava belief that nothing but God (achieved through or without a means, it depends) can confer liberation. So much so that hagiography tells us the following: a very ill Periya Nampi (Rāmānuja’s Ācārya) was walking towards Śrīraṅgam along with Kūreśa (I think), both having been blinded by the extremist Cōḻa king. While Kūreśa survived, Periya Nampi was too old to bear the attack. And if I remember right (and oh, does anyone remember which text mentions this?), Kūreśa suggests that Periya Nampi should make some effort, because they are so very close to Śrīraṅgam. Wouldn’t it be better to pass away there? Periya Nampi heard this, and lay down right where he was walking: it is Bhagavān who grants mokṣa, not Śrīraṅgam. And he would make that point by passing away outside the Śrīraṅgam area. He was, they say, worried that he would be setting a bad example by seeking Śrīraṅgam out for shedding his mortal coils…

So, this is why I was surprised: that a Śrīvaiṣṇava guruparamparai should quote a verse in such high praise of what is nothing more than an acit (water/river) with a soul (Kāverī). Any thoughts on this?

I need to check the GPP text that I mention above if the Periya Nampi event is narrated in there. I have just started seriously reading the *Mūvāyirappaṭi* by Tṛtīya Brahmatantra Jīyar, so I will have to keep an eye out for such minor things, which are not so minor in importance after all.

PS: I have dared upload my amateurish sketch here. I was just so tired of looking for what I wanted on the Internet that I decided that my own bad drawing is better than someone else’s professional one.
