K.V.S. Manian was and remains an archetype and a symbol and a combined embodiment of numberless Indians who awakened to a questionable freedom at midnight. K.V.S. Manian was also a real person, a poorly-paid stenographer silently toiling away at the office of the Director General, Civil Aviation.

Until the Nehruvian hell visited him on 12 December 1948.

This is his story.

From the Sanatana civilizational and cultural perspective, the history of independent India is an ongoing commentary on Nehru-inflicted darkness. Mohandas Gandhi’s assassination at the hands of Nathuram Godse on 30 January 1948 forms perhaps the most pivotal prefaces to this commentary. The well-known story of how Nehru’s Government summarily banned the RSS in the immediate aftermath doesn’t need repeating here. What needs repeating is this: *the ban was imposed without due process* and at this distance in time, there is every reason to believe that Gandhi’s assassination was the perfect pretext that the Congress and other RSS-baiters were unsuccessfully lusting after for so many decades.

Which raises another historical question: the ban was imposed by a Government led by a political party which had freshly proven that it was too feeble to prevent the vivisection of the sacred geography of an ancient, unbroken civilization in face of a determined Muslim “minority” which extracted a new communal nation for itself.
