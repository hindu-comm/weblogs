WHEN THE BLOODTHIRSTY MOB OF SHOE-SELLERS and their supporters reached the palace, Muhammad Shah was returning with his mother Qadsiya Begum from a visit to the Jafar Khan garden. The moment the mob saw him, they roared, *Deen! Deen! Deen! Insaaf! Insaaf!* A dumbstruck Muhammad Shah managed to pacify them and listened to their complaint. After this, Qamar-ud-din Khan the Wazir, was ordered to send a palace attendant to arrest the accused wherever he might be found.

When the palace attendant reached Sher Afkhan Khan’s bungalow, he was told to basically get lost. Broadly speaking, this was the first clear indication of Muhammad Shah’s utter powerlessness.

But the inflamed shoe-sellers would not relent. They went around Delhi, door-to-door, provoking every Muslim home to join their campaign to defend the *Deen* and express their loyalty to the *Qaum.* The magic pill that has historically elicited countless victories for Islam: *Islam khatre me hai! Islam is in danger! Do your duty.*

It worked like magic.

At the afternoon *Namaaz*, Jama Masjid, the assembly point, was overflowing with the Faithful. Its spacious precincts and its vast courtyard and its inner hall thronged with vengeance-seekers and would-be Islam-protectors. The charged-up horde jammed the praying space and the pulpit and the prayer itself was blockaded even as the clamour and confusion escalated each second.

Leading the rowdy and blood-baying gang was a motley assortment of imported Muslims: Arabs, Abyssinians, and Constantinople Turks. They had been freelance mercenaries brought into Hindustan by two Mughal military officers—Rumi Khan and Sayyad Arab Ali Khan—and had served in the artillery for some time. This mercenary import is a salient feature of all Muslim sultans who ruled Delhi and by itself, forms a separate folio in the blood-soaked history of Islamic rule in Bharatavarsha. But now, in the Jama Masjid, they were unarmed but had not lost their semi-barbaric character, and heightened their bullying by forming a menacing circle around the pulpit. It delivered instant results. Muslim worshippers who had knelt down as part of the prayer ritual had no space to even get up without bumping into the “justice-seeking” rowdies, who now upped the ante. Their target was the *Qazi* himself. He was abused in filthy language and cursed as a foul supporter of the dirty Kaffirs. And then they rained blows on the *Qazi* and his son, yanked them down from the pulpit and pounded and kicked the duo till they were almost dead. Next, it was the turn of the reciter and the expounder. They too, were dragged down from the pulpit and thoroughly thulped into unconsciousness.

The shoe-sellers’ riot had officially begun.
