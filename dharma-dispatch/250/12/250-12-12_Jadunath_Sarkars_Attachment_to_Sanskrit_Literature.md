THOUGH JADUNATH HAS MASTERED several modern Indian and foreign languages, particularly French and Portuguese, *none stands nearer to his heart than the treasures of Sanskrit literature.* He withdraws himself occasionally from the fatigue of the Mughal *Akhbarat* into the company of Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti giving a loose rein to his mind and memory either to sail with the Cloud Messenger (*Meghadutam*) to Alaka, or ramble with disconsolate Ramachandra moistening with a lover’s tears the banks of the mourning Malini and her forest-girt grottos echoing with the sweet memories of his exile; or occasionally to the waterfall of Maha-Kosi in the company of gods to solicit Parvati of her father as the bride of Shiva madly in love with her in *Kumarasambhavam*.

During one of our historical tours, we were going round the ruins of Vijayanagar when the frieze of stone carvings in the hall of the Sahasra Rama-Swami temple arrested our attention. I asked Jadunath what some of those figures could be. He paused for a while and began citing from *Raghuvamsam* without any effort those verses that describe Parasurama’s challenge to Rama on his way to Mithila and his discomfiture by Rama. He then explained to me that the artist who engraved this scene must have had in his mind this description of Kalidasa to feed his imagination and guide his chisel. Jadunath's critical skill and command of Sanskrit helped me in recovering the readings of a badly mutilated copy of some 250 sheets of a manuscript of Paramananda’s *Siva-bharatam* photographed for me. I despaired of the hopeless job, but Jadunath would not. He spent a month on reading those sheets and bringing out some kind of order out of chaos.
