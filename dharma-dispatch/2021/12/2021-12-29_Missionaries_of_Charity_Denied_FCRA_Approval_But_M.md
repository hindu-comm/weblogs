# Missionaries of Charity Denied FCRA Approval: But "Mother" Teresa is the Real Story

### Why India should constantly remind itself of the ugly legacy of Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu and the 70+ years worth of damage she caused to India's global image

THE DENIAL OF FCRA APPROVAL for the Kolkata-based Catholic evangelical organisation, Missionaries of Charity (MOC) is a piece of [good news](https://www.news18.com/news/india/mha-denies-fcra-renewal-to-missionaries-of-charity-after-audit-red-flags-sbi-asked-to-freeze-ngos-account-4604321.html) in recent times. For those who have followed its activities, it is clear that MOC has become a pale shadow of its former self after the death of its celebrity founder “saint,” Teresa.

After her death, MOC has been caught in the heartless [crime](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/the-cult-of-mother-teresa-had-to-obviously-culminate-in-this-horror) of infant trafficking. And this is just among numberless such sleazy activities the outfit has carried on over the decades. In light of all this, the FCRA approval-denial is just a mild rap on the wrist. If India was serious about its internal security and social harmony, MOC should have been shut down decades ago.

However, the real story is not MOC but the sordid career of its fanatical founder, the infamous Albanian nun, Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu popularly known as “Mother” Teresa; now, “Saint” Teresa.

In the backdrop of the FCRA rejection, it pays to recall only some of the most appalling traits of her career as a Christian missionary.
