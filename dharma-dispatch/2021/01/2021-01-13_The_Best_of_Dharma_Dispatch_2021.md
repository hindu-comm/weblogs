IN KEEPING WITH OUR TRADITION of publishing a list of the most widely read articles on *The Dharma Dispatch* each year, we present below a similar list for 2021. We celebrated our third anniversary in September this year and you can read our jottings on the occasion [here](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/dispatches/the-dharma-dispatch-turns-three-our-sanatana-civilizational-journey-so-far).

As we never tire of repeating, our civilisational initiative continues apace, year after year, owing to the support, patronage, encouragement and contributions of the Sanatana community. It is both our backbone and our strength, which spurs our work day after day and helps us offer more back to the community. So, a big, heartfelt THANK YOU to all of you.

We published about two hundred articles this year - not including podcasts and lectures - and here is the list of the most widely read and popular articles on *The Dharma Dispatch* for 2021.

**Do read the** **[full list](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/dispatches/the-best-of-dharma-dispatch-2021)!**

And wish you all a very happy and prosperous 2022!
