## A Partner in Travels

In most of his journeys after 1925 (when I retired from the Baroda service), I have been his companion, and the time we spent together has been most fruitful to me. I shared his hardships and he accorded me a share of his vast store of knowledge, as, while awake we talked day and night of history and history only. Some of these trips which we planned and undertook together are still fresh in my memory. I can never forget the sessions of the Indian Historical Records Commission at Baroda, Gwalior, Nagpur and other places which we attended for years in company discussing many a historical problem, and seeing many a scene of history. Some of the places we thus visited included Indore, Ujjain, Mandasor, Kotah, Gwalior, Bhilsa, Sanchi, Dhulia, Ajanta, Ellora, Assai, Aurangabad, Daulatabad, Deulgaon Raja, Sindhkhed, Lonor, Mehkar, Bassein, Karanja, Ramtek, Vijaynagar, Talikota, Gadag, Tanjore, Sangameshwar, Mathura, Agra and Delhi.

In October 1909 under the earnest patronage of the late Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaekwad of Baroda, his scholarly Diwan Ramesh Chandra Dutta, I.C.S., organised the Maratha Library Conference at Baroda. Jadunath along with M. M. Haraprasad Shastri, Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar and three other eminent scholars were specially invited to attend that grand assemblage of the high lights of Indian history and culture.

As the working Secretary of this Conference, I had the long-sought opportunity to meet and know at close quarters Jadunath after four years’ acquaintance through correspondence. Along with an all-India outlook in letters brought about by this Baroda Conference, *I made a more valuable acquisition, namely, Jadunath’s personal friendship* anchored with love’s lengthening chain through years of tempest in the stormy sea of life.
