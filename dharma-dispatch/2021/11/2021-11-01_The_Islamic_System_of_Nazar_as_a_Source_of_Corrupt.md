IN COMMON PARLANCE, the term *Nazar* generally means “eye,” “sight,” “to set one’s eye upon,” and so on. It also has prolonged cultural and social connotations connected mostly with superstitious elements such the proverbial “evil eye.” In Islam, especially, it has theological significance rooted in various phobias, and there are elaborate rituals on “removing *Nazar.*” In fact, its prophet advises all true Muslims to recite *Masha Allah* “every time we look at something with exhilaration in order to prevent casting the evil eye.”

A defining trait of Muslim administrations was premised on a straightforward maxim of evil: *extort as much as your official position allows you to*. Arguably, this pyramidical system of extortion was first systematized by Ala-ud-din Khalji in the name of his celebrated “administrative reforms.” As a result, in less than five years, lakhs of Hindu peasantry lost their lands overnight and were impoverished to service his unquenchable thirst for gold and war and to satisfy his vanity of being called the “Sikandar of Hindustan.”
