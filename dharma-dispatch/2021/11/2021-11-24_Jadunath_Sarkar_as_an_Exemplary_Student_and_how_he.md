JADUNATH WAS BORN ON SATURDAY, second day of the dark fortnight of the month of *Marga-shirsha* of the year 1870 (10th December 1870) in the village of Karachmaria, Rajshahi district. He had his early education in the town of Rajshahi and passed his Entrance Examination in 1887 standing sixth in order of merit in the University of Calcutta. After having passed his F.A. Examination from the Rajshahi College, Jadunath entered the Presidency College at Calcutta from which he passed his B.A. Examination with Double Honours in History and English in 1891, and here he had to part with History for a time as he chose to take his M.A. degree next year in English.

Jadunath’ s M.A. result created a sensation in the University. He had thrown the previous records in English into the shade. He topped the list of successful candidates obtaining 90, 92 and 95 per cent in three papers, and a little less in other papers. On this account the Government offered him a scholarship for prosecuting higher studies in England, but owing to personal reasons Jadunath declined the offer and decided to work for the Premchand Roychand Scholarship. The Government offer was then accepted by one of his classmates, Mr. Albion Bannerji who proceeded to England and took the I.C.S. Examination along with Mr. Aurobindo Ghose, who had been already there. *What Jadunath lost in the I.C.S. career, proved a permanent gain to history.*

Jadunath’s preparation for the Premchand Roychand Scholarship gave a novel turn to his work in life and requires a word of explanation. That competition in early days was the highest, the most difficult and therefore the most coveted prize under the Calcutta University. Severe written tests were attached to the award and *there were certain years when no one was deemed eligible for it*. Capacity for enormous labour during a number of years, keen aptitude for research, vast reading, a strong memory, proficiency in language, these were the essential qualifications for success in that hard competition. Those who succeeded in winning the scholarship proved to be men of exceptional efficiency and never failed to make a permanent mark in Bengali cultured society and public service.
