JADUNATH FIRST SELECTED the early Mughal period of Indian History, but realising that this involved an extremely wide field, decided to work on Aurangzib’s life, a subject which was full of varied incidents and offered a virgin field for investigation, as it had not till then been attempted by anyone else.

He at once set himself to collecting original materials bearing on that subject and soon discovered many important Persian manuscripts in England and India, particularly at the India Office, the British Museum, the Bodleian Library and also in Paris, Lisbon and Berlin. *He obtained copies of these works at his own expense,* copies made by hand in early stages and later photostats. He also made an extensive search for materials in places like Delhi, Rampur, Lahore, Hyderabad and other former seats of Muslim power. He thus secured a large number of Aurangzib’s letters. For this enormous work he had to engage copyists.

Thus, after patient study and labour, he at last submitted his complete thesis *India of Aurangzib* in a comprehensive treatise with minute details of routes, battlefields and statistics. He also prepared special tables of varied information bearing on Aurangzib’s administration. The University rules required the thesis in a printed form, which he submitted in 1901 and then he received the remaining instalments of the stipulated prize. *The effort involved full nine years of intensive study*, 1892 to 1901.
