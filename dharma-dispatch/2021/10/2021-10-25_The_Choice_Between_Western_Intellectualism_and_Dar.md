AN HONEST STUDY of the so-called Western intellectual tradition shows that it is not older than five hundred years, a relatively short span in the history of humankind. Indeed, the whole breed of something called an “intellectual” (or that contemporary weasel word, “public intellectual”) can at best be traced to the period of something called “enlightenment.” But the manner in which this Western phenomenon of intellectualism and more pointedly, *intellectuals,* attained global domination is the subject of a profound exploration that *should* necessarily be undertaken from the Bharatiya perspective. Better *now* than never. Undeniably, this domination was enabled and abetted by European colonialism whose military might gave cover fire to these *svayambhu* intellectuals. In a related area, it is doubtful whether determined cultural vandals like Max Mueller, Pargiter, Kielhorn, Breloer, Jolly, et al., would have attained such cult-like status sans the encouragement, sponsorship and protection offered by their respective colonial patrons.

The history of the same period also reveals that the attempt to examine the Western intellectual tradition from the Bharatiya standpoint was initiated by the luminaires of the modern Hindu Renaissance but it was tragically short-circuited by the destructive copper wire of Nehruvian secularism. Much unexplored literature on this subject beckons the interested researcher. Here is just the tiniest sample, a model of how such comparative analyses must be made.
