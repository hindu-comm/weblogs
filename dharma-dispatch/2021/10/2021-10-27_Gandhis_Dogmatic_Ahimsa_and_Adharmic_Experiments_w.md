At the very outset, I want to make clear what my intentions are: they are not an attempt at a wholesale vilification of an iconic figure; instead, it is to caution against wholesale embrace and deification of an iconic figure. In this essay, I shall concentrate primarily on two major areas of Gandhi’s life:

1\. His response to the Moplah massacre of Hindus

2\. His vulgar practices to verify for himself if he has been able to adhere to his vow of celibacy.

There are no peace movements in any part of the world that do not invoke the name of Gandhi. He is placed on a pedestal with Buddha, overlooking the fact that Buddha traversed through his inner landscape that led to Self-Realization, whereas exteriority characterized all actions of Gandhi, including his experiments in celibacy, which only led to self-affirmation and even glorification. Accompanying this elevation is another myth that India’s freedom struggle was non-violent. Was it? Perhaps the colonizer managed to leave without much bleeding, but the colonized were drenched in blood.

It is precisely for this reason that Sri Aurobindo cautioned against Gandhi’s brand of *Ahimsa* because it is built on surface level ideals, imposed through the force of guilt. Sri Aurobindo points out that such a Satyagraha leads neither towards purification nor transformation.
