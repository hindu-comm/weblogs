# The Colonial Origins of the Dramatic Performances Control Act, 1876

### The forgotten Dramatic Performances Control Act of 1876 was passed by viceroy Lytton under the Prime Ministership of Benjamin Disraeli to specifically crush opposition to the colonial British rule

TODAY, BENJAMIN DISRAELI’S NAME PRIMARILY evokes a foggy recollection as someone who was well-known for his prose style. Until the late 1970s or early 1980s, his fat novel *Sybil* was a prescribed text in the non-detailed English syllabus for undergraduate students of India. In his own time, outside the literary world, Disraeli commanded two terms as Prime Minister of England and singlehandedly turned around the fortunes of the Conservative Party to the extent that it became synonymous with the unmitigated evil that was the British Empire. He of course, phrased it differently: the Conservative Party was the grandest celebration of the glory and power of the British Empire whose crown jewel undoubtedly was India. With all the honesty that bigotry and racism can inspire, Disraeli genuinely believed that colonial Britain was actually giving “good government” to India. This in turn led an Indian scholar to make this delicious remark of sarcasm:

> In a subject country, nothing could be more dangerous than good government.

In this grand endeavour of empire-scale plunder and oppression, Disraeli was ably assisted by two fellow-racists and cupbearers. The first was his protégé, “Lord” Lytton, the viceroy of India from 1876-80 and presided over the Great Famine of 1876-78, which wiped out a whopping *ten million* Indians in a substantial geography spread across the presidencies of Madras and Bombay and the Princely States of Mysore, Hyderabad, and large parts of the Central Provinces, North Western Provinces and Punjab. The second was “Lord” Salisbury who was Secretary of State for India from 1874-78.

Even as hunger and starvation were killing off Indians like flies, the Lytton-Salisbury duo were busy mining their brains and excavating India for more effective and ruthless means to further bleed the country and enrich their empire of venality. The worst of these was the needless Second Anglo-Afghan War that Lytton unleashed for two long years (1878-80), notable for British gruesomeness and industrial-scale barbarism. We get an idea of the nature of this British brutality when we learn the fact that even folks back home in England were disgusted with Lytton. That is saying a lot given the yet-uncured savagery inherent in these descendants of cavemen. Yet, his country not only forgave this war criminal but actually celebrated it by installing a permanent exhibition in Knebworth House “dedicated to his diplomatic service in India.”

Needless, Lytton couldn’t act without the express instructions of his bossman, Benjamin Disraeli.
