READERS OF *THE DHARMA DISPATCH* are by now familiar with our intense and obsessive reverence for the luminaries of the modern Sanatana Renaissance. One of its Himalayan peaks, Acharya Jadunath Sarkar, has also appeared on a few occasions in these pages. We must equally record our gratitude to our readership who write to us, asking for more, and it is our profound duty and pleasure to oblige them.

Starting with this, we will publish some excerpts of an extraordinarily heartfelt and personal portrait of the great Acharya penned by his lifelong friend, Govind Sakharam Sardesai.

G.S. Sardesai was himself an accomplished scholar of Indian history, most notable for his *Riyasats* written in Marathi, a majestic performance giving us the history of India spread over a *thousand years.*

Their friendship began with a letter that Jadunath Sarkar wrote in 1904 to Sardesai seeking his assistance with some Marathi primary sources for preparing his path-breaking volumes on Aurangzeb. Sarkar was thirty-four years old when he wrote him the letter, and Sardesai was thirty-nine. This portrait of Jadunath Sarkar is actually a mellifluous outpouring of affection for a fellow scholar and savant. It is also a fine and representative paragon of the cultural mien of the *Sarasvata* niche of the Bharatavarsha of that era. But more fundamentally, it is a shining mirror that reflects the temperament, dedication, habits and character of these luminaries.
