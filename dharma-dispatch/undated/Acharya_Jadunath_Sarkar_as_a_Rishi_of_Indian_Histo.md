## Jadunath Sarkar as a Man

JADUNATH HAS NEVER CARED for popularity with the masses of his countrymen either as a historian or a social being. He is a born aristocrat in his unostentatious pride and stern sense of duty and patriotism. Possibly one cannot call him an amiable personality for common purposes. He is by nature unusually reserved and taciturn, inclined rather to avoid tactfully than to avidly seek any limelight. *He has been and aspires to remain always a student as well as a teacher.*

Punctual in all his engagements, regular in correspondence, methodical in habits, strict in exacting work from himself as from others, alert in garnering every bit of fresh information on any topic he has on hand, *Jadunath is all that a genuine student and gentleman should be.*

My long and intimate association with him enables me to know his worth as a man and scholar as hardly anyone else probably does. Usually reticent by nature, uncommunicative and unobtrusive, it is very difficult at first to know his mind or fathom his views. Not being outspoken, he has this advantage that one cannot easily impose upon him. He will not lightly trust a stranger, until he personally tests the sincerity of purpose and his genuine desire to learn. *He hates nepotism and partiality in the public administration.* His sense of duty as a citizen sometimes diverts his powerful pen to outspoken criticism of officials and workers. *He is a fearless critic and, on that account, he had to suffer much in worldly advancement* under the British regime, and now in popularity with the public.

*His own personal needs are quite few. He can sleep on the floor* and take rest wherever he needs it. I have observed him working with a kerosene lamp during the long hours of the night and soundly asleep in the late morning hours. He has often worked days and nights without remission when work imposes on him a stress of that kind.
