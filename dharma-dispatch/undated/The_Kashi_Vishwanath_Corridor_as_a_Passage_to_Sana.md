THE RESPLENDENT VISUAL OF NARENDRA MODI offering Puja to Sri Kalabhairava Devalaya to which Bharatavarsha woke up today is an emotional verse in our ongoing civilizational history, now engraved in gold in the hearts of countless Sanatanis across the globe. When we survey the event from this historical perspective, it clearly reveals a verifiable timeless truth: that our civilization has unfailingly honoured political leaders who have stood up for, safeguarded, and tried to rejuvenate its spiritual core.

There is a sublime reason the heads of the countless Hindu *sampradayas, panthas* and *Mathas* have poured into Kashi in one body on this magnificent and hopefully, history-altering epoch.

The ongoing work at the Kashi Dhama represents just the latest brick in the ongoing Sanatana civilizational restoration occurring over the last seven years. But it is seventy-five years too late, a sliding away of the dark Nehruvian eclipse. In fact, the eclipse wouldâ€™ve never occurred if full population exchange had taken place at the time of Partition, or the loss of a substantial chunk of the original Hindu homeland.
