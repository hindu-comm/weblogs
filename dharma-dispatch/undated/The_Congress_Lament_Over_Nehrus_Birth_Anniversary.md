### The Congress party's complaint that Prime Minister Modi, the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman did not attend Nehru's birth anniversary this year is akin to the situation of the protagonists

BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE AND INFORMED reflection of the last seventy-five years of Indian history, it is clear that two women fundamentally helmed the fortunes of the Congress party for the worse. The first was Edwina Mountbatten and the second is Sonia Gandhi. Think about it.

The lament by the Congress that PM Modi, Amit Shah, the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman were absent at the event to celebrate Nawab Nehru’s birth anniversary reminds me of that brilliant climax scene in *Shatranj ke Khiladi.* That movie is perhaps the most apt metaphor to describe the ongoing litany of impotent fulminations emanating from the steam engine room of the Congress train-wreck. In *Shatranj ke Khiladi,* the terminal story of the real protagonist, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah is primarily narrated through his two chess-addicted courtiers who fail the Nawab through indolent inaction and makes the British takeover of Awadh a cakewalk.

But in the contemporary *Shatranj* of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, the Wajid Ali Shah embodies these courtiers. It was left to mid-range Congress honchos like Jairam Ramesh and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury to voice their feeble protests against an alleged destruction of alleged Nehruvian values. Rahul Gandhi contented himself with an inane tweet quoting Nawab Nehru: “What we need is a generation of peace.” It is notable that the real brainpowers of the Congress such as Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, *et al* continue to maintain a conspicuous silence.
