WE HAVE OFFERED but a teeny drop of our devotion to *Ganakalasindhu,* Sri Rallapalli Anantakrishna Sarma in the pages of *The Dharma Dispatch* [in this](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/culture/a-slice-of-ramayana-in-sri-rallapalli-anantakrishna-sarmas-life) deeply ennobling and elevating episode. As the saying goes, the more we study the lives of epitomized savants, the profounder our quest becomes. Sri Rallapalli, the chosen infant of Sarasvati, who in P.T. Narasimhachar’s memorable words, “generously fed him milk from both her breasts,” served this divine mother with a reverence permeated with an aeolian quality.

Fierce, uncompromising cultural self-confidence is the most defining quintessence of Sri Rallapalli’s entire legacy including but not limited to music and literature. He was the rare diamond that cut through and dazzled brightly from underneath the dust of cultural inferiority complex that had enveloped legions of his otherwise brilliant peers. Even in a delicious essay describing the splendor of Sri Krishnadevaraya’s sprawling, epicurean empire of fragrance, food, feast, celebration and abundance, Sri Rallapalli does not forget to reserve his utter contempt for the “modern” Hindus whose capacity for real enjoyment has become enfeebled in direct proportion to their all-round weakness of the spirit. This he says, is what has led Hindus to the viper-pit otherwise known as a slavish imitation of the West.
