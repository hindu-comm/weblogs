# Pramatha Nath Bose's Brilliant Contrast of the Animalistic West and the Spiritual Hindu Civilisation

### In the second episode, Pramatha Nath Bose gives us a splendid contrast between the West whose civilisation is fundamentally animalistic whereas the roots of the Sanatana civilisation are spiritual.

THE GOSPEL OF EQUALITY is by no means a new one in India. It has been frequently preached ever since the time of Gautama Buddha and has resulted in such large sects as the Buddhists, the Vaishnavas, the Sikhs, the Kabirpanthis, the Satnamis, etc.

However, under Western influence, it is now being preached more widely than ever. What is more, the causes which Western influence has set into operation such as the weakening of the barriers of caste and of its functional basis, are levelling down inequalities more effectively than any amount of preaching.

The result, however, cannot be contemplated with unalloyed satisfaction The gospel of equality, which was preached by our great men in the past had spiritual enfranchisement for its objective. It always had in view the exalted ethical and spiritual ideals which were attained during the highest stage of our civilisation. They endeavoured to remove the barriers of caste only so far as they stood in the way of the ethical and spiritual uplift of the lower classes. The higher castes, especially the highest, with commendable self-abnegation left the money making occupations to the lower ones. So it was only the spiritual disabilities of the latter which weighed upon the conscience of the more sensitive natures among the former, and they preached their gospel of salvation to high and low alike.

As a result of the levelling movements which they initiated and led, we have had, even in comparatively recent times, a large number of universally respected saints and reformers, among whom were women (including penitent prostitutes), tailors, gardeners, potters, goldsmiths and even the outcaste Mahars of Western India.

The modern gospel of equality differs markedly from the old, inasmuch as its objective is almost exclusively material. Its chief, if not the sole aim, is to secure equality of opportunity to all classes in the struggle for animal existence. The increased sense of equality and individuality under Western influence being divorced from our old ethical and spiritual ideals, and having chiefly material betterment and sensual enjoyment for its goal. It is slowly sapping the foundations of Hindu society and Hindu family by loosening the bonds of benevolence and reverence which bound them together.
