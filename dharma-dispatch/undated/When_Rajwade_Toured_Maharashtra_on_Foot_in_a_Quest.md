# When Rajwade Toured Maharashtra on Foot in a Quest for Truth

### Each time a new discovery of historical material was reported to him, Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade would personally travel to the place mostly on foot.

IN THE HALLOWED ANNALS of the stalwarts of the modern Indian Renaissance, we have some like Prof. M. Hiriyanna who wrote very less but what he wrote became immortal by the sheer dint of authoritativeness. Then there are folks like Radhakumud Mookerjee, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Jadunath Sarkar, and P.V. Kane, the variety of whose body of work ranges from doing original, seminal research to writing correctives, summaries, digests, and encyclopaedias in just one subject.

Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade belongs to the latter category.

The other area of Vishubhau’s phenomenal contributions is how he patiently listed down *by hand* the names of thousands of cities, towns, and villages that had seen the impact of the Maratha rule. He examined and explained their meanings from the strength of his mastery over philology, etymology, and linguistics. The result was an extraordinary series of articles with the general title, *The First Colonisation of Maharashtra.*

Rajwade’s conviction, which reflected in all his works, was that history research was not merely an academic discipline or a hobby but was the very foundation on which a nation must be built and nourished.
