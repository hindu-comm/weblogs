Having thus defined who the good teacher is, Pavanandi proceeds to complete his account by pointing out who is *not* a good teacher and can never hope to be one. Our author begins with some general points and then illustrates the fundamental disqualifications using brilliant analogies.

He says:

> Those who are not conspicuous for some noble quality, those who are by > nature mean-minded and disposed to be jealous, greedy, deceitful, and > cowardly cannot be good teachers.

One has only to think for a moment, and try and analyse the reasons for the pronounced failures in the teaching line, to realize the profound truth, underlying each of these statements. A correct understanding of Pavanandi’s meaning would find wider application for his statements.

Even the good teacher has to guard himself constantly against the ever present danger of a subtle lowering of standards. There is no such rule that says, “once a good teacher always a good teacher.” *Excellence in any walk of life is not the permanent consequence of a spurt of effort*. It is maintained and improved only by constant practice.

But the peculiar demerits of the bad teacher are brought out by Pavanandi by a series of analogies.

First of all, the bad teacher is like a jar of Molucca-beans. The idea is this: when a jar of Molucca-beans is emptied, the beans spill out in any order. Likewise, a bad teacher expounds his points in a chaotic and disorderly manner with no reference to their proper logical order, and is too fast and confused for his pupils to make anything out of his lessons.

There is another type who learns with difficulty himself, and has still greater difficulty in imparting his learning to others, the teacher whose intellectual powers are not adequate to his task. For an analogy to this type of teacher, Pavanandi turns to the practice of preserving carded cotton in cocoanut and other shells, the shells being slowly stuffed with cotton through a small hole, the only opening in the shell. The cotton is taken out with even greater difficulty than it was put in.

The defects pointed to by these two analogies are intellectual. Pavanandi uses other analogies to stress the moral defects of the bad teacher. One variety of the palm tree has its stem covered all over with pinnate leaves carried on branches with sharp edges. Its fruit can be gathered only when the tree sheds it, and not otherwise, as no one can climb the tree to get the fruit. In the same way, one type of bad teacher refuses to do anything for the pupil who wants his aid systematically: the pupil has to wait on his whims. Another type of teacher resembles a cocoanut tree which though watered by one man yields its fruits to another, because its stem is bent over across the fence.
