AT THE OUTSET, we are deeply grateful to our discerning readership for their overwhelming response to our essay on Jaitra Simha, the forgotten hero who singlehandedly safeguarded South India from Islamic depredations for nearly half a century. As readers of this journal*,* you are all familiar that excavating the annals of Hindu history in order to offer such real-life stories of Hindu heroes and warriors who stood up to defend our Dharma has been a tradition with *The Dharma Dispatch.*

In the same tradition, we present before you another thrilling and inspirational story of yet another Sanatana hero who not only stood up to the might of the so-called Delhi sultanate but became a source of constant dread to it.

Chahamana Vagbhata.

THE STORY OF VAGBHATA begins with the *Jauhar* of the undaunted Hariraja who in one final burst of valour, had wrested Ajeyameru (Ajmer) back from the “hated Muslim whose face he had vowed not to see.” The hated Muslim was none other than Muhammad Ghori.

However, the revenge was short-lived. Boxed in by the overwhelming Muslim forces of Muhammad Ghori who stormed into Ajeyameru once again, Hariraja ascended the funeral pyre and burnt himself along with his family.

The Hindus in Ajeyameru did not recover from the blow for a long time.

Leaderless and confused, Hariraja’s followers and loyalists migrated to Ranasthambhapura, which had now emerged as the newest Hindu power centre under the sturdy helm of Govindaraja IV, son of Prithviraja Chahamana. He gave them refuge and appointed them to high offices.

Over time, he acquired enough heft and built up a tough deterrence to prevent fresh Turushka depredations from Delhi and stabilized his rule. Govindaraja IV was succeeded by his son Balhanadeva (or Gadhapati Valanadeva) who proved a worthy son to the intrepid father.

On his deathbed, Balhanadeva appointed his eldest son Prahlada as his successor and his younger son Vagbhata as the Prime Minister. Not destined to live long, Prahlada was killed in a hunting expedition and his minor son, Viranarayana became king.

When he reached adulthood, Viranarayana distinguished himself as a formidable threat to Iltutmish, who had become the sultan at Delhi after murdering his benefactor, Qutub-ud-din Aibak’s son. Unable to counter Viranarayana with military force, the sultan beguiled him with a sugary invitation to partake of his fabulous hospitality in his palace at Yoginipura or Delhi.

The *Hammira-Mahakavya* narrates what happened next.

> The wily Muslim came out to receive him, and treated his guest > apparently with the greatest respect. The prince was delighted with > the reception…After a few days’ hospitality, however, the prince was poisoned and died. The joy of the Muhammadans at this event was excessive. They exclaimed that the whole tree was now prostrate at their feet, and they could help themselves with any part of it.
