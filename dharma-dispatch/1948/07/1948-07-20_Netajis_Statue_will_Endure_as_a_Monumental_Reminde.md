EXPECTEDLY, THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER MODI that he will [formally unveil](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-unveil-netaji-statue-at-india-gate-on-sunday-101642824761127.html) a hologram statue of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose tomorrow at India Gate has led to profuse diarrhoea among Lutyens liberals. ‘tis the season once again, when the blunted teeth and emasculated growls of these uncaged Nehruvian canines have come out to prowl on the streets of Delhi and elsewhere, yelping “erasure of history,” “Hindutva project,” and variants thereof.

As we noted [elsewhere](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/decolonizing-delhi-via-the-central-vista-project), Narendra Modi is quietly decolonizing India and reclaiming our history in his own, distinctive fashion. Installing Netaji’s statue is just a continuation of this much-needed historical imperative.

Notwithstanding the nuances of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose’s legacy, the indisputable fact is that this trailblazing hero and indefatigable fighter for India’s freedom has been dealt a raw deal by Nehruvian darbaris starting all the way from Nawab Nehru himself. Small wonder that Nawab Nehru’s great grandson, the unsaleable product of a surreptitious India-Italy collaboration, [has not had](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/amar-jawan-jyoti-merged-with-national-war-memorial-amid-row-top-points-1902972-2022-01-21) the dignity and grace to even *mention* Netaji’s name. Nawab Nehru’s Netaji burden is surely weighing heavily on his enervated shoulders.

All this is recent history, which occurred less than a century ago and which the shameless generational denizens of Nawab Nehru’s court managed to mangle with a ruthlessness rivalling even Aurangzeb. From this perspective, Narendra Modi’s attempts to decolonize and reform the situation is akin to cleansing the national gutter created and nourished by the Congress. There’s just no nice way of saying this.

For all their hollering against Netaji’s statue, the talent-devoid Congress of today is either clueless or is venally silent about the third-rate treatment meted out to Subash Chandra Bose by the non-violent Mahatma. For the first time, Mohandas Gandhi got a cruel reality check of his own popularity and appeal within the Congress when his own party members overwhelmingly voted for Bose as President. The unscrupulous tactics that Gandhi used to unseat Bose from that position is a study in mercenary behavior coated with the pork-fat of egotism and jealousy. Given that Bose was also a Congressman at one time, why hasn’t the party *still* owned his legacy? From this and scores of other perspectives, the real contribution of the Congress to the freedom struggle is not only questionable and dubious but leads us to this inescapable conclusion: a tiny cabal of the top leadership of the Congress usurped the fruits of the selfless work and astounding sacrifices made both by its teeming cadres and millions of non-Congress patriots.

Let’s read what another Congress stalwart from Bengal said in a speech in Bombay in July 1948.

> After ten months of existence, India has produced a maimed and > crippled baby without much sign of life. She has been regulated and > regimented to such a state that she is unable to throw up her arms and > kick her legs. Our recent past has been one of which we cannot be > proud. WE HAVE COPIED IN EVERY DETAIL THE EXAMPLE OF THE BRITISH. The > repressive ordinances, acts and regulations of the British have all > been made into law to-day; even a \[British\] ordinance of 1818 has > found a place in our draft constitution. What is most shameful is that > these repressive measures are far more stringent than the British ever > dared to take. Free speech, association and assemblies are things of > the past. OUR NEWSPAPERMEN ARE REPRESENTATIVES ONLY OF A SERVILE > PRESS; the same men who once had the guts to criticize the British > regime in their newspapers are to-day looking to New Delhi for orders. > Corruption, nepotism and graft are on the increase in every province. > Pandit Nehru had once said that all black-marketeers should be hanged > from the nearest tree and that the public services should be manned by > patriots and not by Indian Civil Servants… ALL THESE UTTERANCES AND > PROMISES MADE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS REMAIN MERELY UTTERANCES AND > PROMISES WHICH AWAIT REDEMPTION…HOW CAN AN ORDINARY INDIAN LOOK UP TO > THE CONGRESS ANY LONGER TO FULFIL THOSE PROMISES? >
> *Capitals in the original*

That was Sri Sarat Chandra Bose, brother of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose. Sarat *Babu* had served as a distinguished member of the then Central Legislative Assembly. The Congress owed its entire political fortune in Bengal to Sarat Chandra Bose. Quite obviously, he quit the party after being disgusted with the way things were panning out but showed it who the boss was. In a 1949 by-election, Sarat Bose contested as an independent from South Calcutta against the Congress party’s Suresh Chandra Das. The election was one of its kind. After filing his nomination, Sarat Bose went to Switzerland for health reasons. The campaign, fought in his absence, was entirely led by the people and pummelled the Congress candidate. Nehru campaigned personally. As did Patel and other powerful leaders. Sarat Chandra Bose was elected with a majority of 4:1.
