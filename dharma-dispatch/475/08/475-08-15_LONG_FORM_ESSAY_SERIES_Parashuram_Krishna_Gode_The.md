# \[LONG FORM ESSAY SERIES\] Parashuram Krishna Gode: The Scholar who Sought the Rocky Mountain

### This is the first episode of a new series commemorating the life, legacy & scholarship of P.K. Gode, one of the stalwarts of the New Indian Renaissance. He sadly remains uncelebrated and unsung.

PARASHURAM KRISHNA GODE stands unrivalled as a resplendent star in the luminous galaxy of the stalwarts of the New Indian Renaissance for blazing a trail of unique distinction. Even the luminaries with whom he rubbed shoulders did not traverse this virgin road. It was an ancient road that had fallen into sorry disrepair. P.K. Gode not only rediscovered it through happenstance but cleared the thorns and debris and smoothened it for posterity by the sheer dint of his untiring labour and unwavering focus. The outcome was an extraordinary literary corpus of 475 top-rated, invaluable scholarly papers running into 3500 pages spread over seven volumes. It was the *tapas* of a lifetime. And more. In a profound sense, only a savant of his temperament could have accomplished it.

To offer just the appetiser of the singularity and flavour of his scholarly penance, here is a list of his papers culled out randomly:

*1. A Manuscript of Rasasindhu: A Rare Work on Alchemy and its Probable Date*

*2. Texts Sanctioning the study of Yoga by Women and their Chronology*

*3. The Snake-charmer (The Simile of Garudika as applied to the Yogi by Ramakantha in his Commentary on the Bhagavad-gita)*

*4. Beliefs about the power of Mustard-Seed to ward off Evil*

*5. Some Contemporary Evidence regarding the Asvamedha Sacrifice performed by Sevai Jayasing of Amber*

*6. The Antiquity of the Caste-Name “ Senvi”*

*7. Identification of historical and Geographical Names in the Laksmanotsava, a Medical Treatise*

*8. Identification of Raiiga Jyotirvid, the author of Vicarasudha- kara, a Medical Treatise*

*9. Keshavbhat Karve, a Poona Banker of the Peshwa period and his Relations with the Peshwa and Damaji Gaikwad*

*10. Antiquity of the Lost Medical Treatise by Kharanadi in the light of the Leaf of the Kharanada-Nyasa newly discovered at Gilgit*

*11. The Hindu Nose- Ornament, its Past and Present*

*12. Studies in the History of Indian Cosmetics and Perfumery*

*13. Antiquity of some IconographicVerses about the Mahalaksmi of Kolhapur occurring in Works on Architecture — Before A. D. 1200*

*14. The Tradition about the Liaison of Jagannatha Panditaraja with a Muslim lady (Yavani)—Is it a Myth?*

*15. Sabdasiddhantacandra, an Unknown Work on Grammar by Samkara, son of Giridhar*

More than six decades after P.K. Gode attained immortality, it is a profound misfortune that almost *nobody* in the realm of Hindu cultural studies has chosen to nurture the scholarly foliage that he so assiduously planted and nourished. In his own time, Gode repeatedly expressed his indefatigable optimism about a promising future for scholarship in these topics. When we read it today, we lapse into mourning.

## **A Lineage of Warriors**

THE STORY OF PARASHURAM KRISHNA GODE begins with the defeat of the formidable Maratha Grand Admiral, Tulaji Angre, son of the indomitable Kanhoji Angre. When Tulaji Angre shot into prominence in the latter part of the 1730s, the sprawling Maratha Empire resembled a confederation of warring factions loosely fused by political chicanery and competing self-interests.

Tulaji, who was patronised by Maharaja Shahu I, quickly became a menace. He had the men, money and muscle to enforce his menace. As the ruler of the Colaba State, Tulaji began launching a series of predatory raids on both land and sea against the British and Maratha feudatories.

By 1753, the all-powerful Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao had resolved to punish Tulaji and in the decisive Battle of Vijaydurg in 1756, he was defeated, arrested and imprisoned for life. It was an unfortunate fate that befell this hot-headed son of Kanhoji Angre, one of the greatest naval commanders in world history. 

But almost a decade before he had infuriated Balaji Baji Rao, Tulaji had earned the ire of other chieftains in the Maratha Empire. With Vijaydurg as his base, Tulaji incessantly raided the territories of four powerful chieftains of the Maratha Empire — the Pratinidhi of Vishalgad, the Pant Amatya of Bawada, Vadikar Sawant and Apaji Angre. Apaji was Tulaji’s own brother. The quartet eventually united and decided to teach Tulaji a lesson he’d never forget. Correspondence flowed thick and fast among the four and an unanimous decision was reached. Tulaji Angre would be beseiged by the combined troops of the four chieftains and brought to heel.

The Pratinidhi of Vishalgad, Gangadhar Krishna called for a strategy meeting in his court. Eminent people from all Varnas and professions were invited. Gangadhar sought their counsel but nobody was forthcoming. After a long time, a confident voice rang out in that assembly: “If I receive orders from the esteemed Pratinidhi, I will collect 5000 troops and expel Tulaji Angre’s men.” 

The voice belonged to Nāro Rāyāji Goḍe Thākur Kārakūn. The founder of P.K. Gode’s lineage.

In a brilliant historical investigation into the Battle of Muḍāgaḍ, P.K. Gode narrates the story of his ancestry in the January 1937 issue of the *Journal of the University of Bombay* in an essay titled *Studies in the History of the Angrias.* Spread over 25 pages, the essay is a fine model reflecting the best traditions of historical scholarship of that era.

This is how P.K. Gode describes the origins of Nāro Rāyāji Goḍe:

<div class="pullquote">

The eldest son Nāro Rāyāji…at the age of seventeen owing to poverty at home…left home without his father’s permission in search of some employment and arrived at Vishalgad with Brahmins who went there for the Navaratra Festival. After the festival was over he requested Shrimant Krishnarao Appa Pratinidhi that he should be given some employment. Thereupon Krishnarao, being pleased with his fine handwriting agreed to employ him on Rs. 100 as (annual) remuneration.    

</div>

NĀRO RĀYĀJI GOḌE quickly distinguished himself as a reliable and intrepid fighter and rose up the ranks. Gangadhar Krishna Pratinidhi recognised his talent and steadily promoted him. Naro reached a high point in his career when he got permission to lead the punitive battle against Tulaji Angre. Armed with the aforementioned 5000 troops, Nāro Rāyāji Goḍe fought a ferocious battle, routed Angre’s men and wrested the Muḍāgaḍ fortress and thoroughly demolished it. To mark the victory, “a plough with an ass was dragged over the site.” 

The Battle of Muḍāgaḍ was thus won by Nāro Rāyāji Goḍe on behalf of his master on 15 March 1748.

Parashuram Krishna Gode hailed from a bloodline of warriors.  

Gangadhar Krishna Pratinidhi granted to Nāro Rāyāji Goḍe the Bhadkambe and Devade villages as *Inam.* Ever since, the two villages — located in the Sangameshwar Taluka, Ratnagiri District — remained with the Gode bloodline continuously for 180 years — i.e., till 1928. That was the year in which Sri Krishnaji Govind Gode handed over a precious family heirloom to his son, Parashuram Krishna Gode. The heirloom was in plural. They were fragments of the *Gode Family Bakhar* written in the Modi script. P.K. Gode narrates his tryst with this heirloom:

<div class="pullquote">

Not being then interested, or trained in the investigation of family history I had put this bundle aside as it was in a fragile condition. Three years after the death of my father which took place on 3rd February 1930 I happened to search the family papers which brought to me the recollection of my father’s wish that I should study the *Bakhar* handed over to me. Thereupon I tried to restore successfully all the available sheets of this *Bakhar* and found to my great surprise that they contained a regular narrative of family history and political events, containing also accurate dates from A.D. 1726 to 1840. Presumably this *Bakhar* must have been written by some one after A.D. 1840 and before 1843 as it mentions the date 1840 (Saka 1762) and also refers to the regime of Amritrao Pratmidhi who ruled from 1833 to 1843. \[Emphasis added\]

</div>

P.K. Gode’s father happened to be the last *Khot* of the aforementioned villages. When P.K. Gode set out to fulfill his father’s dying wish of reconstructing his family history, he pursued the subject in his quintessential fashion: with the patience of an ant, the tenacity of a badger and the meticuolusness of a bear. The outcome included two scholarly papers on the *Gode Family Bakhar* labelled, “for private circulation,” published in 1936 and 1938 respectively. He continously expanded this family history as he found newer material. This is how P.K. Gode describes the fragments of the *Bakhar* that he received from his father:

<div class="pullquote">

The *Gode Bakhar* contains two portions which I have labelled as Part I and Part II. Part I (folios A to G) is older in appearance while Part II (folios I to VIII) is later. Each sheet measures 23 inches by five and half inches and is written on both the sides of the paper. There are about 75 lines on each sheet, so that the total extent of Parts I & II will come to about 1200 lines or 28,800 letters, as each line contains about 24 letters.

</div>

If this wasn’t enough, Gode embarked on a related scholarly voyage. He relentlessly mined the annals of history to unearth the origins and then narrated the full story of the *Varna* of his birth — Kārhāḍā Brāhmaṇas, who primarily hailed from Maharashtra. The result was the lasting gift of these valuable academic papers:

1.  *Raghunatha Mahadeva Ghate, a Karhada Brahmin of the 17^(th) Century
    and His Works—Between A. D. 1650 and 1700*, published in 1942

2.  *The Origin and Antiquity of the Caste-name of the Karahāṭaka or
    Kārhāḍā Brahmins*, published in 1944.

3.  *Some Kārhāḍe Brahmin families at Benares (Between A.D. 1500 and
    1600),* published in 1944.

P.K. Gode’s deep and reverential attachment to his long and illustrious lineage (he counts 12 generations, including his own) is evident in these scholarly investigations. On a broader plane, it also reflects his commitment to a timeless Sanatana social ideal — an unshakeable belief in the sanctity of one’s *Pitrs* (ancestors) whose memory our society had preserved generationally. This in turn is a slice of the Sanatana value of preserving *Parampara* or tradition. People create and preserve *Parampara.* *Parampara* sustains the people who created it.

*To be continued*
