# Hamas Bombs Israel and Lessons for Hindus from Chaim Herzog's 1976 Speech

### Why and how Israel attracts global solidarity each time it's attacked and what Hindus can and should learn from it.

THE JIHAD-HUNGRY MONSTERS AT HAMAS bombed Israel once again, causing perhaps the most extensive damage to the only official Jewish country in the world. The scale of destruction is the worst in recent times.

But barely minutes after the attack, social media was abuzz with countries across the world unanimously standing in solidarity with Israel. Even an otherwise sloppy and inchoate Joe Biden offered to send military support.

And like all such other countries, as an Indian, even I stand in full solidarity with Israel. And as an Indian and a Hindu *and* an inheritor of the greatest civilisation that humankind has ever created, this has once again raised some questions that have both haunted and amazed me from an early age.

1.  Israel and India began roughly around the same time after European
    colonization of the world ended. India became free in 1947. Israel
    was created in 1948.

2.  Thus, for about three fourths of a century, all the way till now,
    the world has always stood by Israel. Why?

3.   The simple and straightforward answer: Israel was not cursed with a
    Nawab Nehru. It has *never* forgotten or compromised with its core —
    that Israel was explicitly created as a home for the Jewish people
    and for safeguarding and preserving the Jewish religion. And it has
    accomplished both through a time-tested method: Strength commands
    respect. Not for Israel the wimpy drama of Nehru's red rose of
    peace. Strength in India’s case would have entailed a full
    population exchange in 1947. Look what we are saddled with for 75
    years.

4.  Compared with Israel for the same period, India has suffered far too
    many Islamic terror attacks from Pakistan. Over the years, our
    successive Congress Governments have run to various international
    forums “presenting evidence” instead of retaliating *once with
    overwhelming force.* Thus, each attack only emboldened the
    perpetrators because of this Nehruvian pusillanimity.

5.  The global reaction to such weak responses was only natural. India's
    repeated suffering at the hands of bigoted Jihadis from Pakistan
    NEVER made global headlines in these 75 YEARS. Not even the ghastly
    26/11 Jihad in Mumbai. But here, in less than 15 minutes after the
    Hamas bombed Israel yesterday, see how it captured global support?
    *This* is what a country smaller than the full geographical area of
    say, Karnataka, commands on the international stage.

6.  Moral of the story: **Strength works**. Always. In deterring,
    fighting, winning and retaliating. **Dear Hindus: this is a primal
    truth** which we as a civilisation have collectively forgotten. Use
    it in your neighborhood as well.

## BLAST FROM THE BLAST

I’M UNAWARE HOW MANY PEOPLE of the current generation know a truth from the recent history of Israel. In 1975-76, the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost his brother Yonathan who was fighting a battle against Islamic terrorists. He was trying to rescue a planeload of Israeli passengers kidnapped by the former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.

This was the heroic episode of the Entebbe Raid, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt. The passengers were ultimately rescued. In its aftermath, the matter came up for a debate in the United Nations Security Council Debate in July 1976. Speaking for Israel, its ambassador, **Chaim Herzog** thundered against Uganda as follows. Excerpts from the speech are given below. Emphases added.

**Chaim Herzog**

### **Chaim Herzog’s UN** Speech of 1976 

“… let me make it quite clear that sitting here as the representative of the Government of Israel, as I have the honour to do, I am in no way sitting in the dock as the accused party. On the contrary, **I stand here as an accuser on behalf of free and decent people in this world.**

**“I stand here as an accuser against the forces of evil which have unleashed a wave of piracy and terrorism which threatens the very foundations of human society.**

“I stand here as an accuser of all those evil forces which in their inherent cowardice and abject craven attitude see blameless wayfarers and innocent women and children—yes, even babes in arms—a legitimate target for their evil intentions.

**“I stand here as an accuser of the countries that, because of evil design or lack of moral backbone, have collaborated with these bloodthirsty terrorists.**

“I stand here as an accuser of all those in authority throughout the world who for reasons of cynical expediency have collaborated with terrorism.

**“I stand here as an accuser of this world Organization, the United Nations, which has been unable, because of the machinations of the Arab representatives and their supporters, to co-ordinate effective measures in order to combat the evil of world terrorism**.

“I stand here as an accuser of those delegations to this Organization which for reasons of political expediency have remained silent on this issue… **In so doing they have become themselves accomplices**.

“**In the dock before us stand all those countries**—they are all too numerous—**that cry to the high heavens when they are affected by terrorists, that fulminate at this Security Council table when their citizens or diplomats are threatened, and that remain silent when the same happens to citizens of other countries.**

\[…\]

“**Israel’s action at Entebbe in order to release its hostages has given rise to a worldwide wave of support and approval**, such as has rarely been seen from every continent, including Africa; from every walk of life; from countries hostile, as well as friendly, to Israel. The ordinary man and woman in the street have risen behind us…

“In more ways than one, this Organization \[UN\] is in the accused stand today.

Mankind will judge it by its behaviour on this occasion, because never has the

issue been clearer; never has the issue been so clear-cut. There will be no excuse

in history for this body, or for the constituent Members of this body, if it fails to

condemn terrorism.

\[…\]

“If the \[Security\] Council will fail to seize this opportunity which has been granted it to eliminate the scourge of terrorists, kidnappers, hijackers and blackmailers from our midst, **then it will plunge to the lowest depths in the eyes of mankind and will disappear in history** as yet another great and tragic lost opportunity in history.

“**It has fallen to the lot of my small country, embattled as we are… to demonstrate to the world that there is an alternative to surrender to terrorism and blackmail.**

“**It has fallen to our lot to prove to the world that this scourge of international terror can be dealt with.** It is now for the nations of the world, regardless of political differences which may divide them, **to unite against this common enemy which recognizes no authority, knows no borders, respects no sovereignty, ignores all basic human decencies, and places no limits on human bestiality**.

“We come with a simple message to the Council: **We are proud of what we have done, because we have demonstrated to the world that in a small country,** **in Israel’s circumstances, … the dignity of man, human life and human freedom constitute the highest values. We are proud not only because we have saved the lives of over 100 innocent people—men, women and children—but because of the significance of our act for the cause of human freedom.”**

THIS IS HOW you speak from a position of strength. *This* is known as unapologetic courage of conviction in action. *This* is what Hindus must internalise.
