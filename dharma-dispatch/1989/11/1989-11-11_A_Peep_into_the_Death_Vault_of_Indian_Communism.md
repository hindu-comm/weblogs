STARTING WITH THIS ESSAY, we will offer a few occasional snippets drawn from the blood-soaked annals of Indian communism. For two straightforward reasons. *One*, to revisit and re-emphasise the fact that the genocidal-nihilistic death cult called communism is not only still alive but thriving in ways we can’t fathom. *Two,* because for more than half a century, the whole world was neatly partitioned into perpetually warring camps: Communists and the rest. Communism was the single-most threat to world peace following World War II. It is astonishing how quickly we have forgotten this vital fact after Soviet Russia fell in 1989.

Our various articles on *The Dharma Dispatch Digest* documenting and exposing multiple facets of this deadly ideology too, had this goal in mind. But it is only when we open this death vault with arduous spadework that we can unearth the appalling skeletons buried deep inside the communist crypt.

This is a genocidal journey from M.N. Roy to Aruna Roy.

It’s a journey we must undertake for three crucial reasons:

\(1\) To inform ourselves about the historical facts that have now transformed into a nation-threatening fatality at all levels.

\(2\) To safeguard whatever survives of the unbroken Hindu civilisational and cultural continuity.

\(3\) To ensure that this genocidal cult is not only uprooted but never finds a conducive incubator in India in the future.

## Doughty Warriors Against Communism

<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent">

<div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset _pubTheme_1msvp_1">

<div id="§doughty-warriors-against-communism" class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top">

</div>

</div>

</div>

Perhaps the most doughty fight against Communism in India was offered by the redoubtable duo of Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel in the 1950s under the aegis of the long defunct Society for the Defence of Freedom in Asia (SDFA). The battering ram of their blazing intellect pounded the most resolute Communist wall of all-encompassing deception.

Dipping his pen in acid, Sita Ram Goel mercilessly seared both Communist theory and practice *and Communists* in the USSR and China in a political and intellectual climate clogged with the heroin vapours of this cult. In his earlier days, Goel’s razor-sharp analysis and pulverising prose exposing the savage realities of Mao’s China was avidly read by Home Minister Sardar Patel himself who clandestinely encouraged these efforts. It’s a profound national tragedy that we lost Sardar Patel so early and suffered Nehru, the philandering Indian version of Stalin for seventeen cruel years.

Standing on the shoulders of such warrior Rishis not only makes our job easier but evokes our everlasting gratitude for their pioneering work the undying embers of whose scorching trail remain an inspiration for future generations. Titles like *Mind Murder in Mao-land*, *Communist Party in China: A Study in treason, China is Red with Peasants' Blood, Red Brother or Yellow Slave?* leave nothing to the imagination as it should be.

## A Constant Theme

The stunning theme even in a partial study of Communism in India is the glaring absence of a comprehensive work that documents its recorded and record crimes against the Indian people, its culture and civilisation. This absence of contemporary and historical documentation in spite of the Himalayan evidence they’ve themselves left behind of their villainy is a yawning chasm that needs to be filled.

The body of stellar intellectual and scholarly work of Ram Swarup, Sita Ram Goel, Arun Shourie and K.R. Malkani are perhaps the most pathbreaking and notable in this regard. But history awaits one such comprehensive work, which can easily run into several volumes given the century-long and continuing record of the Communists waging war against the Indian state and Hindu Rashtra and civilisation.

THREE EXPLANATIONS can be offered for this.

The first is their perfected art form of inducing public amnesia about their crimes by piling on even more brutal and greater number of crimes at a breathtaking pace.

The second is the innate spirit of Hindus, the majority in India, who were successfully lulled and misled by the noble-sounding sloganeering of the Communists. For the longest time, the Hindu society couldn’t connect the fact that Naxal terrorism was the inextricable and real-life terror operation inspired by this sloganeering.

The third is the Nehruvian dictatorship over information dissemination, and his economics of Hindu impoverishment which left millions busy trying to survive with no time for such ideological or political analyses.

<div class="pullquote">

**I would say that the Communist Party is not a thing to be feared, yet it cannot be destroyed by any force or any violence. The Communist Party feeds and grows on force and violence.** Truth, understanding, and an ability to measure this thing calmly and react in a democratic way this will destroy it. This will leave it out of our scene, and it doesn’t belong in this scene anymore.

</div>

The acclaimed American novelist and former, hardcore Communist Howard Fast, who decimated Communism in America with his intellectual nuclear bomb, *The Naked God*, said this in an interview in 1958. He was speaking strictly in the context of his era during which the parasitic worms of the Frankfurt School had just set foot in America.

At this distance in time, we can say that Fast grossly underestimated their reproductive capacity and skill at being amorphous monsters. Yet, there is a grain of truth in what he says: that only truth, equanimity, patience, courage, and information above all, are the best weapons to destroy Communism. But like most ex-Communists, Howard Fast too, paid a terrible price for lifting the lid off the Communist sewer. His senior contemporary in Europe, the prolific and brilliant Arthur Koestler, one of the immortal renegade communists, literally went insane and died a miserable death.
