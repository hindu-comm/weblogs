# An Obscure 120-Year-Old Whitepaper on Introducing Sanatana Education in Indian Schools

### At the height of British colonial rule in 1902, a fine Hindu thinker, Sri Sundararaman authored this brilliant essay for introducing Sanatana education in our schools to combat Bible "education."

OUR ONGOING RESEARCHES in the area of Indian education have yielded a rather remarkable essay published in April 1902 that we unearthed from our archives. In the contemporary idiom, the essay is akin to a white paper. Its primary focus is to usher in what the author calls “religious education” in schools. As you will read, what the author, Sri Sundaram, really advocates is an undiluted Sanatana education of which he is an undoubted champion.

## Religious Education in Indian Schools

In modern India, all forms of organized public activity are apt to be spasmodic. While the great masses of the people run their predestined course of struggle for daily bread according to the opportunities available to them from time to time and then turn their thoughts heavenward in contented and silent resignation during the intervals of rest from toil, some highly educated men who enjoy office, emoluments, comfort and leisure seek out a hundred opportunities for making a stir in the minds of the few who are akin to them in tastes, pursuit, and aims. The leaders as well as the rank and tile of this cultured minority of Indian Society create but very little impression on the immense population around them on whose behalf they work and for whom they speak. Their views and feelings find expression in a language unknown to the millions, they produce little or no effect on the practical life of Society at large, or any section of it.

The cry for religious education is founded on the vague impression in the minds of some educated Hindus that thereby they can put an end both to Christian Conversions and also to the tendency to adopt European fashions in regard to food, clothing, hair-dressing, &c. But we believe that the introduction of religious education in the form in which the Bible is taught in Christian Colleges and schools cannot produce the intended effect of checking the evils above mentioned, or even of transforming those who remain within the pale of orthodoxy.

## The Religion of the Rishis

The religion of the Rishis is presented to us in two aspects. These are the *practical* and the *philosophical* aspects of the Aryan religion. The practical aspect concerns the duties of life and consists of two parts, viz, the ceremonial, and the ethical and social. This practical aspect of Hinduism is what is known as Dharma, or Karma, or Yoga—all of which are synonymous terms, though they may be used also with special reference to some particular portion of the entire code of duties.

With the Hindus, all human duties have one and the same source, viz, the authority of the *Sruti* and the *Smriti*, i.e., the scriptural injunctions of the divine sages and teachers who have known and taught the truth. *We reason about Dharma and Adharma only to ascertain what the prescribed duties are, to reconcile apparent contradictions, and to unify the whole into a consistent scheme of life.* But we ought not to alter them, and we are bound to observe them in our daily life.
