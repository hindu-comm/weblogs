WHEN PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI [called the](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/congress-leader-of-tukde-tukde-gang-prime-minister-modi-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/89418440.cms) Congress as the leader of the *Tukde Tukde* gang in parliament yesterday, he was merely expressing the national sentiment. *Tukde Tukde* is simultaneously an attitude, an intent and a state of mind whose political mothership is the Nehruvian Congress party.

Nawab Nehru’s role in the Indian freedom struggle reveals three characteristic elements. First, he was a convenient absconder—i.e., this delicate darling would scamper off to Europe when things got too rough here. Second, he was the ultimate theory master who thought among other things that the freedom struggle was a playground of ideas and competitive political theorizing. Third and the most important, *Nawab Nehru had no national vision*.

Despite my reservations about Nehru, I do not begrudge or belittle his contributions to the freedom struggle. However, contributions are measured by their outcome, and in his case, the outcome remains disastrous because its underpinnings were flawed, and the source of the flaw was his encapsulated ignorance of his own country.

A national vision stems from an innate recognition of national integrity on the plane of the spirit. Its outward expressions encompass all spheres of our national life: politics, society, economics, religion, education and culture. It is what fuses all of them as a harmonious whole. When you regard each of these elements in isolation, integrity suffers damage.

In Nehru’s case, he isolated the rest of the Indian national life by placing primacy solely on politics and economics, both of which were driven by his zealous attachment for Soviet-style Communism. The consequences were along expected lines.

Perhaps the most detrimental consequence has been the descent of India into a state of quasi-anarchy. The Congress today is the leader of this anarchy because Nehru was its progenitor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE STORY DATES BACK to the Congress Resolution of 1928, sponsored by Motilal Nehru, which for the first time envisaged the creation of linguistic states after India attained independence. Perhaps that was the only promise that this party ever fulfilled in its tawdry and decrepit existence. The worst part was that it completely kept the 562 Princely States—about *forty percent* of (undivided) India’s geography—out of the scope of this resolution.

The linguistic reorganization of India was in reality a redrawing of India’s political map and it was achieved on the carcasses of the Princely States. It is also a subject that needs a thorough re-evaluation if we are serious about preserving the integrity of India itself. The commission set up to examine this linguistic reorganization issue delivered its unambiguous verdict in late 1948: things should be left as they were. Old boundaries had been sanctified by the informal agreements and usages and customs over the eons. Even the British, when they created new Provinces and administrative units, had left the boundaries and local traditions untouched. They rarely interfered with language. Even a British journalist and writer had a better grasp of this Indian reality than the Nehruvian establishment when he wrote this:

> The commission most strongly criticized the creation of linguistic > states on the grounds that they would inspire linguistic and therefore > local patriotisms which would inhibit the growth of a national > consciousness…which was fundamental to such growth.

But then, the aspiring Stalin inside Nawab Nehru had no clue about these practical realities of his own civilizational nation. His tyrannical role models had “created” the USSR from scratch, and this devotee aspired to inflict the same upon Bharatavarsha. And so, in “creating” India, he created an unsolvable mess.

The consequence showed almost immediately. Potti Sriramulu’s fast-unto-death for slicing out Andhra Pradesh which culminated in his death transformed the Telugu-speaking regions into a flaming inferno. It witnessed a Nehru crumbling to his knees in Parliament. And the message rocked the nation: the Prime Minister was susceptible to violent blackmail.

Prime Minister Nehru was susceptible to blackmail because he was eminently susceptible to flattery.

After Nawab Nehru inaugurated the formation of Andhra Pradesh in October 1953, a national wave of mass agitations erupted, and the States Reorganisation Commission was formed. The Commission submitted its report in October 1955. In its immediate aftermath, widespread rioting and violence followed in Orissa, Bengal, Bihar, Bombay, Ahmedabad and Punjab. Less than a decade after India achieved “Independence” and was supposedly “united” politically.
