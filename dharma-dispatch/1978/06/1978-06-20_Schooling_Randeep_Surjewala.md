Yesterday, Congress leader **Randeep Surjewala** tweeted this screenshot comparing Priyanka Vadra’s Chikmagalur rally with Indira Gandhi’s 1978 rally in the same city.

Surjewala badly needs schooling. Here are some home truths about Indira Gandhi’s 1978 rally in Chikmagalur.

**Devaraj Urs** was the Karnataka CM back then. He had put the entire state machinery at Indira's disposal, in a way.

Massive contingents of Congress "workers" descended on Chikmagalur from all parts of Karnataka. Hardcore rowdies & goondas were enlisted & fed copious amounts of liquor and food. The Inspection bungalow, a government property was their boarding and lodging.

One of the most notorious rowdies, **Kotwal Ramachandra**, led one squad of these Congress goons. They were armed with huge tranches of weapons: swords, bludgeons rods, soda bottles, etc.

What followed was pure mayhem spread over a week or so. Kotwal & gang mounted jeeps, huge gangs in lorries, etc unleashed terror in the vicinity. Opposition party workers/supporters were hunted down like animals and thrashed. The faces of cops were pelted and torn and scarred by gashes made by flying pieces of soda bottles.

Villagers were terrorised into submission. Many businesses were ransacked and ruined. The whole plotting was spearheaded and strategised by several Congress goons who later became ministers holding fertile portfolios. The vile F.M. Khan orchestrated some of this mayhem.

—-

I can go on & on but this sample is sufficient. And yes, Indira Gandhi won the election. Which is why Priyanka is reduced to a farce of making dosas at random joints.

**Postscript**

Old timers in the Chikmagalur and surrounding areas will testify to all these and other horrors that took place back then. \</END\>
