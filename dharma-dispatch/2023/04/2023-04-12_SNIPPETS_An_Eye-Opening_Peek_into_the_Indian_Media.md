[SNIPPETS] An Eye-Opening Peek into the Indian Media after 1935

AMONG OTHER THINGS, the Government of India Act, 1935 had a far-reaching impact in ways that we are still yet to grasp but that is a story for another day.

An immediate and great impact was the formation of autonomous provincial governments throughout India. Needless, all of these provincial governments were headed by the Congress party but the colonial British government at the centre kept a tight watch on them. That vigil extended even to the functioning of the press or media as it’s called today. The home ministry began building files on all newspapers and magazines.

Three years later, J. Natarajan, deputy principal information officer, wrote a note dated 8 October, 1938. This is how it read. Emphasis added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been a distinct change in the attitude of newspapers in India in regard both to their sphere of interest and criticism. It was inevitable that, with the setting up of autonomous governments in the provinces, newspapers should devote greater attention to provincial problems. **But it was not anticipated that newspapers generally regarded as ‘pro-Congress’ would take an independent attitude and criticise the popular provincial governments no less vehemently than they did the previous diarchic regime**.

**Indian Nationalist Press**: **Well established papers in this class have been strongly critical of Congress governments’ resort to ‘repressive’ measures—**the enforcement of the Criminal Laws Amendment Act in Madras, and demanding of securities from newspapers in Bombay and in the CP \[Central Provinces\].

**Congress Reaction**: **That Congress ministries and party leaders generally feel the effects of this criticism and need for a party press is evident from the fact that, within the last three months, two new papers have been started, namely, the National Herald from Lucknow and the Indian Express from Madras.**

The Indian Express . . . is well-controlled by the Madras premier, Mr C. Rajagopalachariar (sic), who has given short shrift to Congress socialists and anti-Hindustani agitators and has been described by them as a Nazi in his methods.
