THIS EPISODE FEATURES AN IN-DEPTH analysis of the 2006 Hindi film, *Rang De Basanti* as a vehicle of Communist propaganda that has three primary purposes: pushing the age-old anti-India agenda, driving the anti-Hindu narrative and targeting the BJP.

The movie follows the familiar communist template of using art, literature, poetry, drama and cinema to propagandise communism among the Indian masses.

*Rang de Basanti* was a huge blockbuster when it was released and acquired a semi-cult status especially among the urban Indian youth. However, its commercial success was largely because it drew a historical parallel with five revolutionary Indian fighters: Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Ramprasad Bismil, Ashfaquallah Khan, and Shivram Rajguru and juxtaposed them with five youths of contemporary India. This parallel was achieved by twisting the facts of history and presenting the historical revolutionaries as communist heroes, which they were not.

The distortion of history is done to push a specific narrative of equating the colonial British rule of India with a constitutionally elected government of independent India.

The propaganda in *Rang de Basanti* thus works at multiple levels all aimed at the same goal: of advocating a violent overthrow of the Indian government.

This podcast episode gives a broad historical background of the origins and methods of communist propaganda in India and provides specific points on how these methods are used in *Rang De Basanti*.
