AMONG ALL THE UNREADABLE books I’ve read, Amartya Sen’s *Argumentative Indian* occupies the bottommost spot both because of its content and even more because of its author. The fact that I had actually eviscerated it on my old blog is also a belated self-realization of the folly of my younger days: that I had dignified it by writing about it. It can most charitably be described as a bible of senility.

Lest I be accused of singling out Amartya Sen, I’ll also include that other kindred intellectual sheep, Sunil Khilnani, the contemporary originator of the infamous phrase: *idea of India,* which is short form for Nehruvian secularism. It must take an order of infinite magnitude of intellectual dishonesty for Khilnani to bracket Buddha, Panini, Kautilya, Adi Sankara and Swami Vivekananda with Akbar, E.V. Ramaswami Naicker, Allama Iqbal, Jinnah, V.K. Krishna Menon, Sheikh Abdullah and M.F. Hussain.

Which is why *Sheep* best describes these worthies. Sheep as signifying meekness. But then, their past-shelf-life careers show them also to be the lifelong votaries of that ultimate, sacred dictum of all: the meek shall inherit the earth. A career of meekness has indeed served them well. Amartya Sen, Khilnani, *et al* have enjoyed cushioned lives notching up all sorts of awards and honours. Seven-star careers in every sense of the word because a seven-star stay, howsoever long it may be, is merely a vacation. It can never be home. And there will inevitably come a time when they have to *vacate*. But the real dirty work begins *after* they vacate: somebody else will have to clean up the mess they have made.

This is the briefest history of the alleged Indian intellectuals of the last century. It is also a preface for what follows.

Every major city in India has its underbelly of cheap imitations. For the longest time, USA was a moniker for third-grade imitation-products churned out at Ullasnagar in Mumbai. Available at throwaway prices, these products ranged from clothing to electronic gadgets, all of which brazenly sported authentic-looking branded labels: Panasonic, Sony, and the rest. Likewise, there were the infamous “Bellary jeans,” or denims available for as little as ₹ 150 in the late 1980s and the mid-90s, manufactured on the outskirts of Bellary and Hosapete. After you paid the money, the tailor at these ramshackle clothing factories would openly ask you: “sir, what label would you like?”, and scatter on his table metallic and canvas logos of Levis, Lee, Wrangler, etc. You paid an extra ₹ 20 rupees for getting them stitched on the hip of the denim. The same thing was true for Compaq (remember?), HP, and Dell computers “manufactured” in S.P. Road.

IN THE REALM OF what the West defines as intellectualism or intellectual tradition, Amartya Sen, Sunil Khilnani, *et al*, are the Ullasnagar, Bellary and S.P. Road equivalents. The West loves and patronizes them precisely because of this. But today, the scene has shifted in a substantial manner: poverty and racial victimhood porn of Africans is the *glamour de jure.* In the colonial and postcolonial era, the Amartya Sen and Salman Rushdie types were the real deal: they were *Indian Exotica,* much in demand. And they made the most out of this extended vacation.

But an honest study of this so-called Western intellectual tradition shows that it is not older than five hundred years, a relatively short span in the history of humankind. Indeed, the whole breed of something called an “intellectual” (or that contemporary weasel word, “public intellectual”) can at best be traced to the period of something called “enlightenment.” But the manner in which this Western phenomenon of intellectualism and more pointedly, *intellectuals,* attained global domination is the subject of a profound exploration that *should* necessarily be undertaken from the Bharatiya perspective. Better *now* than never. Undeniably, this domination was enabled and abetted by European colonialism whose military might gave cover fire to these *svayambhu* intellectuals. In a related area, it is doubtful whether determined cultural vandals like Max Mueller, Pargiter, Kielhorn, Breloer, Jolly, et al., would have attained such cult-like status sans the encouragement, sponsorship and protection offered by their respective colonial patrons.

The history of the same period also reveals that the attempt to examine the Western intellectual tradition from the Bharatiya standpoint was initiated by the luminaires of the modern Hindu Renaissance but it was tragically short-circuited by the destructive copper wire of Nehruvian secularism. Much unexplored literature on this subject beckons the interested researcher. Here is just the tiniest sample, a model of how such comparative analyses must be made.

> If Socrates and Plato, Wordsworth and Carlyle, Goethe and > Emerson…represent \[Western\] civilization, it is not, then, very > different from our own. BUT THEY ARE NOT ITS EXPONENTS. IT HAS GROWN > IN SPITE OF THEM. THEIR TEACHINGS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN CRIES IN THE > WILDERNESS.

Therefore, while assimilating it, we should > beware of its evils. (*Capitalisation Added)*

This was the iconic DVG speaking in 1908 at the Chennai Jana Sangham, when he was a mere boy of twenty-one. That he gave this lecture at the height of British colonial rule in the lucrative Madras Presidency shows the strength of the iron that throbbed within him. Other stalwarts of his generation were also made of the same iron. A hundred and thirteen years later, *where* is that contemporary Hindu “intellectual” who can speak the same truth about the West even in a diluted version? In “independent” India. What is also notable in DVG’s speech is the natural flow of this assessment: shorn of pedantry, devoid of bush-beating, it is plain truth stated plainly, a candour emanating from irrepressible cultural self-confidence.

But even as DVG spoke these words, two and half generations of Macaulayite Hindus were slowly beginning to assert themselves. Amartya Sen & Co are their generational spawn. The history of the same period also reveals another ugly, tragic reality: for the most part, a good number of Hindus were Macaulayized; we will be hard-pressed to find Macaulayized Muslims.

A major consequence of the Macaulayization of Hindus was the creation of a new Hindu elite, which became indifferent to its own society, and *this class was created from the scratch*. *It was a class that never existed at any point in Bharatavarsha’s millennia-long history* including under oppressive Muslim rule. This imported phenomenon should have died in India after 1947 and its justified demise should have been lessons in our textbooks, describing it along these lines: “the valorous story of how Hindus defeated and overcame cultural colonization.” What should have remained in museums became India’s unofficial political religion.

To turn to DVG once more, this is how he outlines the contours of the Macaulayite class:

> How could I fall into the error of making a missionary of myself? It > is only people wanting in modesty that conceive great ideas of > themselves and their so-called missions here.

He wrote this in a letter to his friend, Narasimha Murthy in a different context but the description is apt. The “mission” that he alludes to is symptomatic of the incurable malaise of the so-called Indian intellectuals: self-righteousness and a notion of self-infallibility in their illusive quest to “correct” the wrongs of society. In reality, it is not a quest but a crusade of the worst sort.

Indian intellectuals of the sort described so far are perversions in human form of everything that Bharatavarsha’s cultural genius and *Darshanic* Kailasa regards as profound and exalted. If Shiva’s Third Eye—in itself a profound metaphor—has to burn anything to ashes today, it is this class of intellectuals.

*To be concluded in the next part*
