FIRST OFF, LET’S LOOK at a couple of quotes:

> Wake up, folks, wake up! As intimidated as you are by the fear of > going against the stream and looking racist \[communal\] you don’t > understand or don’t want to understand that a Reverse Crusade is on > the march. As blinded as you are by the myopia and the stupidity of > the Politically Correct, you don’t realise or don’t want to realise > that a war of religion is being carried out. A war they call Jihad. A > war which is conducted to destroy our civilisation, our way of living > and dying, of praying or not praying, of eating and drinking and > dressing and studying and enjoying life. As numbed as you are by the > propaganda of the falsehood, you don’t put or do not want to put in > your mind that if we do not defend ourselves, if we do not fight, the > Jihad will win. It will win, yes, and destroy the world that somehow > or other we have been able to build. (Oriana Fallaci: *Rage and > Pride)*  

> Violence does not live alone and is not capable of living alone: it is > necessarily interwoven with falsehood. Between them lies the most > intimate, the deepest of natural bonds. Violence finds its only refuge > in falsehood, falsehood its only support in violence. Any man who has > once acclaimed violence as his METHOD must inexorably choose falsehood > as his PRINCIPLE*.* (Alexander Solzhenitsyn, *Nobel Lecture on > Literature)*

WRITING AGAINST THE CURRENT in a democratic society poses problems of a different kind. Pondering at the range and depth of writings of Ram Swarup (1920-1998) and Sita Ram Goel (1926-2003), and the approach of our academia and media towards them gives an inkling of the problem.

In a totalitarian political system – Fascist, Communist or Islamist – a non-conformist writer can hardly publish anything. Even writing in private is a dangerous venture. But in a country with complete freedom of speech, with a ‘politically correct’ intellectual ambience, an inconvenient author can be silently buried in indifference. Not even the most open minded readers would know of his existence. Speaking of the Soviet case, Solzhenitsyn had observed that “the environment is dense and sticky: it is incredibly difficult to make even the smallest movements because it immediately takes the environment with them.” In contrast, the atmosphere in democratic countries is “like a rarified gas, or almost a vacuum: there it is easy to wave one’s arms, jump, run, turn somersaults – but it all has no effect on anybody else, everyone else is doing exactly the same in a chaotic manner.”

Without understanding this difference, we can never comprehend why even sixty years’ of original work of the rare duo of Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel hardly left a mark on the intellectual scene of our country. Both died largely unsung.

It is not a small measure of the regrettable situation that even a solitary biographical sketch of them each came from a Belgian scholar, Koenraad Elst. No Bharatiya scholar, journalist or student wrote one. Neither in their lifetime, nor after they passed away. Our media did not even bother to take note of the demise of Sita Ram Goel in 2003. The chief reason for this unfortunate state of affairs is that their work remained largely unknown to the general public of our country. Both were original and non-conformist thinkers. Our governments as well as the academic class felt quite at ease in ignoring them. Media happily followed suit.

There was a time in the Soviet Union when Solzhenitsyn was vilified. His works were considered ‘concoction’, ‘betrayal’, ‘disease’ and what have you. Even in the Soviet Literary Encyclopaedia of 1973 his name found no place at all (this, after he was already world-famous with *Ivan Danisovich,* and the Nobel Prize). He simply did not exist.

Alexander Solzhenitsyn

IN THIS COUNTRY, a very similar attitude was applied towards Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel as far as our academic class is concerned. Goel found no mention in intellectual debates and writings on issues he published for decades. If rarely someone mentioned his name, it was scornfully dismiss him as ‘communal’. Hence unwanted, irrelevant. It is a mark of the pathetic condition of our social sciences that after the demise of the Soviet Union, and opening up of the Soviet and East European archives, our Marxist professors were not dragged on the coals for their propagandistic writings masquerading as scholarly ones. Nothing happened by way of re-examining their highly distorted writings on history, political science or economics. On the contrary they are still ruling the roost! By corollary, even after the demise of communism, Sita Ram Goel and Ram Swarup are not accorded their due place in the scholarly arena for their realistic, incisive and farsighted analyses of the communist systems. Perhaps after the advent of a Saudi Gorbachev, this might be done.

## Disaster at Inception: The English Takeover

Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel wrote on Communism, Marxism, Maoism, Islam, Christianity and Hindutva. In this country all these are politically sensitive subjects. As is well-known, to the first five issues it is considered politically correct to be respectful, even reverential. As for the last one, it is best to disregard, if not mock openly. Reasons are various for this pitiable situation in this otherwise intellectually rich country.

A misconception regarding the Islamic mentality on the part of the national leaders since the 1920s was one. *Getting the very first Prime Minister heavily enamoured by Marxism, Soviets and Islam* was another. It has to be understood that the founding moments of any institution, law or system invariably become crucial to set the tone and standards for a long time to come.

For a free Bharat the period of, say, 1947-56 was such a founding one because so many of our intellectual or socio-political traditions laid down by the Communist-and-Islam-leaning first Prime Minister.

ENGLISH BECOMING THE intellectual language of the country, even after freedom from the British rule, was the third reason. *It summarily and effectively excluded more than 95% of the population from participating in influential intellectual exercises.* Thus a possible corrective to ideologically marred theories, propositions etc was foreclosed at the very inception. English ensured that even if a Bharatiya citizen is wise, experienced, knowledgeable and articulate, he or she can do nothing to check or persuade an erring intellectual or a whole intellectual group – unless he can do it in English. (Besides he must also hold a high chair to be heard.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discourse in any language other than English in this country, howsoever rich and invaluable, simply does not touch the influential, decision making classes. *Thus, intellectual pursuits became an undeclared monopoly of a minuscule few,* *who, even if grossly errant, ignorant or misguided on a matter in hand, could still set the standards for the entire country to follow* (History writing and NCERT textbooks since inception are a case in point). The rest of the population simply came to accept, in naïve belief, *a la* Soviet citizens of yore, that whatever is emanating from the high chairs of a Council, Academy, Commission, University, Centre or Ministry is certainly better informed. ‘They must know better who speak and write in English’ became the common, if disastrous, sentiment among the Bhartiya public.

In the subjects mentioned above, that never was the case. The philosophy, understanding and experiences of the common Bhartiya masses were vastly different from the English-wielding intellectual elite about, say, the ways of socio-economic change or the Islamic character. Yet they could do nothing, thanks to the monopoly of English in matters academic or policy, to correct the academic and political decision makers. This restrictive, anti-Bharat role of English in a free Bharat is hardly considered in analysing why such a ‘politically correct’ intellectual atmosphere came to rule here.
