THE UNAMBIGUOUS VERDICT of the century-long history of Communism in India is this: Communism has been a force for absolute evil for the country. One hundred plus years of Communism in India is also the history of insurrections against the Indian state.

Despite overwhelming evidence available in public domain, this contemporary history of the Communist cultural genocide in India has never been told to at least four generations of Indian children.

Unless the complete and true history of Communism in India is introduced on an urgent basis in school textbooks, it will further erode whatever civilisational strength India has still managed to retain.
