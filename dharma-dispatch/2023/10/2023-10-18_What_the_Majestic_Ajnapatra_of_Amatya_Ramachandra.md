IN COMMON PARLANCE, AN *AJNAPATRA* means a royal edict issued on a variety of matters including administration, gifts, deeds, ratifications of say, a business charter, etc. In other cases, it was also a document meant for guidance on these matters in the sense that it was not binding.

One such brilliant if not encyclopaedic *Ajnapatra* was written by the formidable Amatya Ramachandra Pant who served as Shivaji’s Finance Minister in his famed *Ashta Pradhan* or Council of Eight. His *Ajnapatra* is widely regarded as the formal documentation of Shivaji’s ideals and policies of administration, and rightly so. Written in the Marathi Modi script, the work was completed on November 19, 1715. It loosely follows the model of Kautilya’s immortal *Arthasastra* although that work was a feat of original genius. However, what is notable when we read the *Ajnapatra* is again, the same point we never tire of repeating: the awesome civilizational continuity of Bharatavarsha: from Kautilya to Shivaji. Ramachandra Pant composed the *Ajnapatra* as both a theoretical and practical manual or guide for Shivaji’s grandson, Sambhaji II, who ruled as the Raja of Kolhapur.

The Amatya’s *Ajnapatra* is divided into two broad sections containing a total of nine chapters.

The first section gives valuable historical details of Pre-Shivaji times and the second, details of the Post-Shivaji period.

The second section comprising seven chapters is entirely dedicated to elucidating a vast range of topics on administration.

Evidently, this work is an invaluable primary source to understand the history of Bharatavarsha during the era told by an eyewitness.

Starting with this, we shall publish the most relevant extracts from the *Ajnapatra* hoping it will be of use to scholars, researchers and even regular readers.

Happy reading!
