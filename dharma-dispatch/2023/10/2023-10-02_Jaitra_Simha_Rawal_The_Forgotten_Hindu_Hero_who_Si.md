A SHORT WALK OF 2.5 Kilometres down from the divine precincts of Eklingji or a longer drive of 31 Kilometres from Sri Krishna’s famous *Lila-Bhumi* at Nathdwara leads us to the ruins of the once-mighty and resplendent Sahasrabahu Devasthana. At Nagda.

Nagda.

The glorious capital city of Medāpāṭa (Mewar) that radiated Hindu power, prosperity and piety for centuries under the gallant Guhila dynasty immortalized by the doughty Bappa Rawal, the frontline lionheart who repelled the early Turushka invasions and enshrined himself in the Hindu heart by building the grand Ekalinga Devalaya. The debt that the global Hindu community owes to this gallant clan of Kshatriyas who won and lost and lost and won against the villainous depredations of the despised Turushkas and never gave up their sacred Dharma is truly non-repayable.

The same leonine blood of Bappa Rawal coursed in the veins of the hero of this essay, Rawal Jaitra Simha, the 27th descendant of the dynasty.

Jaitra Simha remains buried in the abyss of obscurity, a fate he shares with uncountable Hindu heroes like him. This is a tragedy that continues to earn compound interest on the seed capital known as Hindu civilisational amnesia.
