MULTAN, NOW IN PAKISTAN, is home to the world’s largest repository of Sufi shrines. Its original names were Moolasthana, Kashyapura and Kaspatryus, mentioned by the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus.

Multan was also the first major ancient Tirthakshetra to be ravaged by Muhammad bin Qasim who desecrated the grand Aditya temple in the city.

But there was another equally sacred temple in Multan: **the Prahladapuri temple**. The history of the Prahladapuri temple is painfully similar to the tragic history of all Hindu temples in the landmass now known as Pakistan.

After Multan was thoroughly Islamicised, **the Prahladapuri Temple was the only place of Hindu worship in the city.**

In 1831, it was protected by a small garrison of Sikhs against great odds. The temple survived in this perilous fashion for nearly 150 years after this.

In the 1970s, the Pakistan Government took over the temple and built a Madrassa in its premises.

In 1992, a fanatical Muslim mob completely demolished the temple.

This podcast episode narrates the full historical backdrop to the fortunes of the Prahladpuri temple and the lessons it teaches us.
