THE SANSKRIT ROOT *BHA* generally means “sun,” “light,” “to glow,” “to shine,” “to look attractive,” and so on. Some of its familiar derivatives include *Bhāskara* and *Bhānu.* But its most renowned derivative is the very name of our country, *Bhārata.* In the human realm, the once-ubiquitous surname *Bhaṭṭāraka* was variously used as a title of respect, a formal address that had a range of meanings including preceptor, saint, sage, king, a noble lord, and so on. Its most frequent usage occurs in the Buddhist annals where Bauddha Munis and philosophers are addressed using the generic *Bhaṭṭāraka* honorific. *Bhaṭṭāraka* also means “Sun.” In some regions of *Bhārata*, the term *Bhaṭṭāraka-vāra* was used for “Sunday.”

The resplendent Maitraka Dynasty that ruled from Valabhi in Saurashtra, Gujarat, flourished for three centuries and carved a glorious niche in the socio-political and cultural history of *Bhārata.* The very name, Maitraka has its origins in *Mitra* or Sun. Some of its illustrious rulers adopted the *Bhaṭṭāraka* or *Paramabhaṭṭāraka* title. The Valabhi University should arguably rank as their finest contribution to Indian learning. At its peak, it rivalled the more renowned Nalanda.

Even to this day, Jain monks and heads of Jain Mathas are titled *Bhaṭṭāraka.*

However, the diminutive form of *Bhaṭṭāraka* will be instantly familiar to today’s audience. This is the omnipresent, pan-Indian surname, *Bhat, Bhatt, Bhatta, Bhattacharya, Bhattar*, another nomenclatural proof of the awesome and sustained cultural unity of Hindus and *Bhāratavarsha.*

When we read Indian history in this fashion it not only comes alive like a pulsating, contemporary reality but debars any scope for distortion. We are invited to a tasty feast of the never-ending experiential joy of further exploration, discovery and rediscovery.

The history and fortunes of the *Bhaṭṭāraka* or *Bhat* title or surname is as chequered and bumpy as it is revelatory. From its remote origins as an honorific and later a surname, it was largely applied to the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas (we do not consider Jainas and Bauddhas as separate from Sanatana Dharma). For much of its millennial journey, the title retained its pre-eminence and inspired pride and accountability among its holders to behave and conduct themselves according to the highest standards of piety, scholarship, and Dharma.

Apart from some of the aforementioned kings, an incredible gamut of *Bhaṭṭārakas* or *Bhattas* emerged on this sacred soil and strode over several realms like absolute colossuses. In literature we have the eternal Bana Bhatta. In rhetoric, there was the outspoken Mahima Bhatta. In the realm of poetics, the 11th Century Kashmirian Mammata Bhatta remains an enduring figure. Then there is the famous Manusmriti commentator, Kulluka Bhatta. In astronomy and mathematics, we have the absolute early master in Aryabhatta.

However, there was another class of *Bhattas* who followed a profession that went extinct about a hundred and fifty years ago. These were the bards, panegyrists and eulogisers. Spread over a vast expanse of India’s sacred geography from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and parts of contemporary Maharashtra, these luminaries commanded quite an extraordinary degree of patronage, respect and reverence *for more than a millennium*. In general, their main occupation was to glorify the king by composing original poetry in Sanskrit or *Bhāratīya bhāṣā* set to tune. They also maintained records of the royal dynasty’s lineage and important milestones of its history. They were learned in an impressive list of subjects including languages, prose, poetry, geography and several aspects of the administration. Some of them also worked as full-blown bureaucrats.

## Extant Origins

The earliest extant record of these *Bhattas* is available in an inscription grant that occurs in the Western Ganga dynasty dated 968 CE in the reign of Satyavakya Permmanadi. His bard Jayasena Bhatara (*Bhatta*) ruled over the Kâreya province (this roughly falls in the contemporary Mysore-Nanjanagud belt) wrote this grant which reads as follows:

> Jayasêna Bhatara who was ruling Kâreya, and the bold Dandanâyaka > Bikkeya, assigned the land for cultivation for the Devigere and > Piriyakere which Nagavarma had ordered to be constructed. Jayasêna > Bhatara allowed four kaṇḍuga as rent-free land for the upkeep.

One kaṇḍuga = 160 litres or its equivalent in weight.

When we travel from Karnataka to Gujarat-Rajasthan, we notice the same bards performing pretty much the same functions in the 12th century. This Nadol inscription describes a solemn promise made to Maharaja Rayapala by a group of sixteen *Bhāṭs*. The inscription’s text has been paraphrased as follows:

> We solemnly promise to find out, according to the customs of this > country, by means of the Caukaḍika (Panchayat) system whatever is lost > by, or snatched away from, the Bhāṭa, Bhaṭṭaputra, and others on their > way.

The inscription gives the full list of all the sixteen signatories whose names are prefixed with the title *Bhaṭṭāraka.* More incredibly, these sixteen *Bhaṭṭārakas * hail from the following major regions: Nadol, Anhilwara, Baroda, Dwarka and Kathiawar. The term *Bhaṭṭaputra* is the correct linguistic form of the contemporary surname, *Barot*, who belonged to the upper echelons of professional bards and panegyrists.
