## Shivaji’s Policy and Accomplishments

Possessing the power of judging the character and ability of men, he appointed new servants, and increasing their burden of work according to their abilities, he showed how to make them fit for works of great importance. Even though each servant or subordinate was irreconcilable with the other, he, by the influence of his own power, by showing kindness to all, by not allowing one to insult the other and inducing them all to work together, made them do their master’s work.

Shivaji, by the force of his own intellect and ability and without being afraid of anyone, subdued some by marching against them and fighting fierce battles with them. Upon some, he made sudden attacks.

Shivaji regenerated the Marathas of the ninety-six noble families. Having ascended the throne, he held the royal umbrella and was coronated the *Chhatrapati.* He rescued Dharma, established Devatas and Brahmanas in their due places and maintained the six-fold duties of sacrifice. He officiated at Yajnas and nurtured other virtuous deeds such as study and teaching, giving and receiving gifts according to the division of the four *varnas.*
