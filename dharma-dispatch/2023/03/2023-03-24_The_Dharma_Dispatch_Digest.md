AS PROMISED IN OUR UGADI WISHES post, we present the inaugural episode of **The Dharma Podcast**.

In this podcast, we expose some carefully hidden truths of the brutal oppression of Hindus, and their miserable plight under the rule of the Nizams of Hyderabad.

These are truths of fairly recent history that almost no mainstream book of history or popular narratives will tell you.

Quite the contrary.

The mention of Hyderabad or its Nizam today evokes only vague memories of the integration of princely states into the Indian Union, Operation Polo, the Nizam's fabulous wealth and similar superficial information.

However, truly horrific tales of Hindu persecution are buried beneath all these memories.

In reality, the liberation of Hyderabad in 1948 was not only an urgent necessity but an imperative civilisational recovery for the Hindus who formed 87% of the population there.

Do listen to the full podcast episode! And share it widely!
