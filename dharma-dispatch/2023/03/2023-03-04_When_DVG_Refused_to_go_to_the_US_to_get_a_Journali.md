When DVG Refused to go to the US to get a Journalism Degree

A profound snippet from DVGâ€™s reflections on his long and distinguished career as a journalist who wrote both in Kannada and English for more than six decades. He wrote the following words more than half a century ago. There is much material in here to contemplate upon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I HAD DECLINED SCHOLARSHIP from government offered by Sir M. Visvesvaraya when he was Dewan, for me to go abroad to study journalism.

**I declined the offer because I felt that for one practising journalism in Mysore, there is little that should be learnt in London or New York**.
