**THOMAS BABBINGTON MACAULAY’S** comprehensive vandalism of the unbroken educational heritage of India wouldn’t have been so successful but for the unstinted official support he got from **William Bentinck**, then the Governor General of India.

Bentinck’s destruction of the centuries’ old educational system of India is a devastation that the country will perhaps never recover from. His project was ably assisted by **Macaulay, Charles Trevelyan, Charles Metcalfe and Mountstuart Elphinstone**.

Hundreds of Sanskrit schools and colleges across Bengal were the maiden victims of this project. The Calcutta-based **Goḻiśrī Saṃskṛta-pāṭhaśālā** -- Golishri Sanskrit School -- in Calcutta was one of the first such institutions to fall.

Premachandra-Vagisha, the head of the Golisri School wrote anxious letters to the British desperately begging them not to destroy his sacred school. Reading those letters even today is a painful experience.

But nobody in the 19th Century British establishment paid heed to his gut-wrenching appeals. The consequence: five generations of Calcutta citizens haven't even heard the name of Golisri Sanskrit School.
