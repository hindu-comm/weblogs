THE DHARMA DISPATCH TAKES GREAT DELIGHT & HONOUR TO WISH all its readers and subscribers a very happy and auspicious Ugadi 2023. We celebrate the *Śobhakṛta-Samvatsara*, the 37th *Samvatsara* in the 60-year cycle.

As we step into this new dawn, *The Dharma Dispatch* reaffirms its commitment and lifelong dedication to every profound cause and value and ideal that has shaped this eternal civilisation and culture. As before, we will strive to maintain its unbroken continuity and will fight against forces that threaten it in any form.

In this endeavour, the support we have received from *you*, our profound readers, is truly immeasurable and words fall short to express our gratitude. Still, a HEARTFELT THANK YOU for keeping us going.

Starting this *Samvatsara,* we plan to introduce regular podcasts and hopefully videos on topics you’ll love. They include rare stories, semi-academic and academic essays and the usual *Dharma Dispatch* menu that you’re all familiar with by now.

As always, we repose our faith and trust in our readership to help us continue this growth trajectory of building a truly original Sanatana narrative rooted in the Hindu ethos. And as always, we seek your kind contribution and support in this endeavour. That way, we feel a sense of belonging to the larger Sanatana community with *The Dharma Dispatch* as a mere *Nimitta.*
