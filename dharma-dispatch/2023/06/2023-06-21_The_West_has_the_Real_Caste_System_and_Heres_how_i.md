# The West has the Real Caste System and Here's how it Works

### A recent tweet by an organisation called Podcast Movement reveals the truly shocking reality of the caste system in the West.

THE WEST HAS A CASTE SYSTEM. And it is hiding in plain sight and once in a while, it inadvertently emerges with surprising candour. The latest example is this tweet.

“Harm done by his presence” ranks right up the miserable top spot in the caste narrative constructed by the West about India. Needless, the handle which tweeted this garbage has a “movement” as its suffix, a dead giveaway of the fact that it is another Far Left or Woke hellhole. The same Left which in India remains at the forefront of maligning the Hindu civilisation and society for about a century using the colonial caste narrative as one of its more effective weapons.

The Western invention of a Hindu “caste system” should count as one of the most spectacular and successful hoaxes in human history. Successful because Hindus themselves not only purchased the hoax but are continuing to fund it with their own money and resources to their lasting detriment. The classic case of cutting your nose to spite your face. Or cutting the branch on which you are seated. Or setting fire to your farm because your neighbour’s farm yielded a better harvest.

The West, or specifically, the British invented and sustained the fake “caste system” with a cold-blooded intent of keeping their hold over India by dividing the Hindu society using a multi-pronged approach. Today, if we read the copious amounts of bile that their “scholars” of “Indology” wrote, the experience is truly vomit-inducing. And these “scholars” wrote not out of a genuine quest for knowledge but often under explicit directions of their political masters. It is incredible to read, for example, a Breoler comparing “Chancellor” Chandragupta Maurya to Chancellor Adolf Hitler. By extension, Kautilya—who is regarded as an Acharya—is transformed into a Goebbels. And folks like Breoler were awarded multiple Phds for *this* “scholarship.”

The caste narrative falls in the same category. Concocting the “caste system” as the *only* defining feature of the Hindu social organisation made it easy to keep the Hindu society on a continuous boil. We get the clearest contrast to this in the same colonial narratives about the *real* caste system that existed — and still does — in the Muslim society in India. The Sharif or Ashraf form the elite followed by the Atraf (literally: low-born) and the lowest of the low, the Arzal or Ajlaf. But when was the last time you heard the UK and US Academia and public discourse even *mentioning* the existence of Muslim castes? However, the same Western academia has the temerity to *demand* punitive legislations against what it calls “caste discriminations” by Hindus in America and England. And a major share of the blame for letting things fall to this dangerous state lies with the Hindu community itself. But that is a story for another day.

IT IS INCREDIBLE IF WE THINK ABOUT IT NOW. That how the vilest of all caste systems was flagrantly practiced by those who invented the “caste” label to exclusively demonise the Hindu society. Racism. Incurable megalomania about the superiority of “white skin.” The white man’s burden. The civilising mission. That you had closed clubs which openly had signboards saying “dogs and Indians not allowed” on Indian soil.

Not that it was restricted to India alone. For centuries, in Europe and elsewhere, you had a variant of the same signboard: “dogs and Jews not allowed.” And Ben Shapiro is a Jew. But in the current Woke scheme of things, Shapiro being a Jew or no doesn’t matter. The inhabitants of the Woke sewer regard him as their mortal enemy. Not that I have much sympathy for Ben Shapiro because we need to remember that he is not exactly a friend of Hindus or India. Because some Hindus like some of the things he says and admire how he takes on the Wokes, it would be a grave mistake to consider such folks as our allies.

It must take incredible levels of evil to demonise the rest of the world based on nothing but skin colour. But then, skin-colour racism was just the industrialised West’s avatar of a far more ancient racism: dividing the world into believers and heathens. The heathen, like the Kaffir was condemned by birth. He needs saving or slaughter. There is no middle path.

In a truly brilliant [essay](https://www.michaelcrichton.com/why-politicized-science-is-dangerous/), Michael Crichton, one of the last great novelists of our own time, tore apart an even more contemporary version of Western racism.

*"Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.*

*This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.*

*I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.*

*Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California… It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.*

*Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.*

*THE THEORY WAS EUGENICS, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed… The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.”*

*This* is the intrinsic nature of people who continue to rant against the mythical Hindu “caste system.”

But the story dates back much further. Even at the turn of the previous century, it was routine to read a common phrase in mainstream British newspapers: “every person must know and behave according to the station of his life.” This phrase originated in medieval Europe, in the golden age of Christian darkness. *That* was the *real* feudal society in which you were doomed right at birth for the crime of being born in the wrong family. There was simply no way to better your “station” except by becoming a robber baron in which case the king himself would “honour” you a pompous title. This is pretty much a one-paragraph social history of medieval Europe.

In direct contrast, except for some painful interregnums, the Varnashrama system of Bharatavarsha had remained pretty much fluid. Some of the greatest Hindu monarchs cutting across space and time arose from what is now classified as “backward caste” and “scheduled castes and tribes.” The history of Indian business reveals even more profound dimensions of this social fluidity and mobility.

In my limited studies, I’ve found that Richard Crasta’s *Impressing the Whites: The New International Slavery,* is one of the most devastatingly accurate exposés of the Western caste system, which is *real*. In fact, this caste system is sanctioned by the Christian scripture. On that limited point, I agree with the Black Lives Matter and assorted loonies who claim that the foundation of modern Western “civilisation” is racism.

But in attempting to “destroy” this racism, they have invented a more virulent caste system. The screenshot of the tweet at the beginning of this essay is precisely that.

“Harm done by Ben Shapiro’s *presence*.”

Chilling.

This, when the Wokes don’t have full political power. Think about what would happen if they do.

The message to Hindus everywhere can’t be clearer: they *will* come for you. The so-called anti-caste legislations explicitly targeting Hindus already underway in the US are a disquieting premonition.
