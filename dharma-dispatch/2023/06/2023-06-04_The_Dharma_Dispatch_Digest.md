IN THIS EYE-OPENING CONVERSATION, scholar, columnist, author and an authority on Communism and Marxism, Dr. Shankar Saran takes us on a superb guided tour of the motivations, methods, and impact that Communists have had in India for nearly a century.

Dr. Saran speaks about his own journey as a card-carrying Communist initially, and narrates his experiences of being a Marxist ideologue and teacher. He exposes their hypocrisy, their toxic belief system, and the duplicitous role they have played in Indian politics and the public discourse.

Dr. Shankar Saran also provides substantial details on how the Communists infiltrated almost all democratic institutions, and the tactics they employed in this ideological takeover. He shares valuable insights into what they label as research and how it has played out in real life.

Of great interest is the manner in which the Communists founded the notorious **Jawaharlal Nehru University** (JNU), which has a long history of national subversion using the resources of the Indian state. In particular, Dr. Saran provides shocking details of the JNU’s visceral hatred for Hindu traditions, knowledge systems and institutions. Equally, Dr. Saran reveals the methods of appointments to influential academic positions almost all of which are controlled by the Communists.

THIS PODCAST IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all thinking Indians who will be shocked and appalled at this national travesty called JNU which has continued for about 70 years. It is also an eye-opener and clarifies many issues and questions that people may have about the Jawaharlal Nehru University.
