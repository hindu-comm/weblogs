## Introduction

SRI K.A. NILAKANTA SASTRI is justly known for his most famous work, *A History of South India.* Sri Sastri wrote prolifically, churning out some twenty-five full-fledged works on various aspects of south Indian history in a distinguished career spanning about half a century. His primary focus was the culture and history of the Tamil country and people for which he had an abiding passion.

What is lesser known are his contributions to various journals and magazines. It is here that we find some rare gems all but forgotten now. One such gem is his longform essay he wrote in an academic journal on the education system in the Tamil Desam from the pre-medieval and medieval times. The essay is notable for a wealth of cultural insights and the underlying philosophical impulses that informed this education system.

The following are some eye-opening excerpts from this brilliant study. After reading it, the contrast between that profound system and the generation-destroying cauldron that today’s “education” in Tamil Nadu signifies will become self-evident.

Minor editorial changes have been made.

Happy reading!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Literacy in itself is not education. In the seventh and eighth centuries, we have Pandya and Pallava inscriptions on stone and copper in two languages, Sanskrit and Tamil, and three scripts—Grantha, Tamil and Vatteluttu. It seems a fair presumption to make that literacy in Tamil must have been more widespread by the time the Pandya and Pallava inscriptions came to be engraved. The excellence of workmanship evidenced by many of these epigraphs implies that *the artisans who actually carried out the work of engraving were by no means ignorant copyists of models set before them,* *but educated men who enjoyed their work did not lack originality.* The Chola Tamil inscriptions of Tanjore go far to strengthen this belief.

## Tiruvalluvar

Tiruvalluvar in his *Kural*, the storehouse of early Tamil wisdom, counts writing and arithmetic as the two eyes of the soul, the means of perfecting man’s insight into the nature of things. This ancient author was by no means oblivious of the role of the ear in education. With characteristic terseness he states that of all the forms of wealth open to man, that gained by the ear is the best. This is a statement calculated to emphasise both the part of the teacher in scholastic education and the possibility of another type of education for the illiterate.

We may now take leave of Tiruvalluvar with one final citation from his sayings on the value of a true education:

> The penury of the learned is better than the affluence of the > ignorant; a truly learned man does not lose his soul on account of > poverty, whereas wealth controlled by an uncultured person may result > in much social evil.
