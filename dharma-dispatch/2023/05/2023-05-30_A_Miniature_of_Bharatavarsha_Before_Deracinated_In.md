# A Miniature of Bharatavarsha Before Deracinated Intellectuals Ruined it

### Some contours of the spiritual vibrance of Bharatavarsha before Hindus were mentally colonised

THE FOLLOWING IS A SLICE of the panorama of Bharatavarsha’s cultural ambience before it was infected by this class of intellectuals.

*तर्कोऽप्रतिष्ट्टः श्रुतयो विभिन्ना  
नैको ॠषिर्यस्य मतं प्रमाणम् ।  
धर्मस्य तत्वं निहितं गुहायां  
महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः ॥  
tarko'pratiṣṭṭaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā  
naiko ṝṣiryasya mataṃ pramāṇam ।  
dharmasya tatvaṃ nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ  
mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ ॥*

*Reason is unstable; the srutis are various; there is not a sage whose word may be taken as authoritative; the inmost principle of Dharma is hidden in the cavity of man's heart; that path therefore is the right path by which the enlightened savants at large has thought fit to travel.*

*mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ*--the road *always taken* by these savants is the most important precept here. In other words, unless *Sastra* culminates in righteous living—a living which has been *demonstrated* by real people with verifiable righteous consequences, *Sastra* merely remains a theory. Theories can be duplicated or recast or refuted. The virtuous life can only be realized by living it via the guidance or imitation of savants and sages. This imitation is the path that leads to the destruction of ego. It is not imitation in the Emersonian sense that imitation is suicide.

Exalted stories like that of the butcher Dharmavyadha, illustrate precisely this precept. In this story, the Rishi was not humbled but *enlightened* by Dharmavyadha. We also find a sublime echo of the same precept in Sureshvaracharya’s immortal verse:

*na khyāti-lābhapūjārthaṃ granthosmābhirudīryate \|  
svabodha-pariṣuddhyarthaṃ brahmavinnikaṣāsmasu \|\|*

*Not for the desire of fame, profit, or honour has this work been composed by me, but for the purpose of purifying my own understanding by testing it on the touchstone of the knowers of Brahman.*

The Santana intellectual tradition—if it can be called that—has always been *Darshanic* in the sense that it not only transcends the intellect but ennobles it. We notice precisely this spirit pulsating in the veins of the giants of the modern Sanatana Renaissance. They are the inheritors of the tradition of say, Adi Sankara and Sureshvaracharya. Even on the mundane plane, their attitude towards life itself determined their work which is why they have remained solid. This attitude can best be described as an august yearning for the transcendence of the eons, for something bigger and beyond themselves. None of these luminaries had what is today celebrated as a “goal of life” or whatever is meant by that. It is this spirit of yearning that built our extraordinary temples and chiselled our immortal sculptures and manifested itself as classical music. This yearning is also a pursuit of beauty, and the pursuit of beauty is an invitation to transcendence. None of these are within the grasp of the mere intellect.

In all these senses, the aspiration to become an intellectual is an aspiration to become a dwarf, and it springs from the same myopic vision that reads only newspapers and magazines and crime thrillers, and watches only television or even worse, is addicted to mobile phones.

AS WE MENTIONED, the foregoing is a miniature of the Sanatana philosophical tradition as manifested in various realms. Indeed, none of our luminaries from the Vedic era up to the modern Santana Renaissance made any “final pronouncements” or spun grand theories about how things *ought* to function, to say the least. Completely contrary to the contemporary fad of “newness” and “innovation,” they were scrupulously reverential towards past masters. Even the aforementioned stalwarts of the Sanatana Renaissance, after weighing any issue, would typically conclude by saying, “subject to correction” or “this may be further investigated,” etc.

In a tangential fashion, we can also cite the lived instances where the ubiquitous village Purohita or Acharya was also an “intellectual” and thus, every village was a self-contained Sanatana cultural cosmos.

How these masters worked also has a bearing on what into making them. Here is a magnificent picture of Jadunath Sarkar’s method of working.

> For Jadunath Sarkar, it was essential for a certain cultivation of > self-denying ethics in the personhood of the historian, a practice of > a sense of ascesis, for without that, the historian could not receive > the truths the facts told…it was a way of preparing oneself for a > truth that was beyond partisan interests. A self-denying quality he > willingly imposed on himself…It was an inextricable part of his > historical method; the man was the method.

Indeed, our ancient greats spent an entire lifetime learning just *one* Sastra, and today, we have social media “experts” waxing pompously on everything from quantum physics to the “secret” of the Bhagavad Gita and *Nasadiya Sukta* with a self-arrogated haughtiness that is breathtaking in not its ignorance but folly. This happens because deep study and profound learning is confounded with making Twitter threads, the byte-sized equivalent of ammonia-coated beauty pageants.

Which brings us back to the same challenge that confronts us: do Hindus want to be the…hmmm…”right wing” version of Amartya Sen or can they infuse the courage within themselves to remain rooted in Bharatiyata and examine the claims of other traditions from that standpoint? There is *no* neutral ground. The choice is between an invitation to *Darshanic* timelessness and the allurement of the ephemerality of intellectualism.
