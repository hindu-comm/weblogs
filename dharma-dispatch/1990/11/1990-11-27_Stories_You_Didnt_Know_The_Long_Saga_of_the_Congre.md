WHERE DOES ONE EVEN BEGIN?

Examining three core facets of the Sanatana conception of statecraft, polity and governance is a good place. These are *Achara* (Conduct), *Vyavahara* (administration, bureaucracy, governance, etc) and *Danda* (penal code, punishment, etc). All three are interlinked and do not stand independent of one another. In fact, each determines the health of the others. Thus, the conduct of the ruling class influences governance and administration which in turn impacts or colours the dispensation of justice. A slackening or lapse in any of these areas will crash the whole system. Which is why our ancients strictly emphasised on the *conduct* of the ruling class, above all. In this context, *Danda* is also imbued with a profounder element: apart from being a deterrent and an enforcer, it guarantees freedom from fear to the proverbial ordinary citizen.

The inescapable conclusion that follows from the foregoing discussion is the fact that the Government apparatus that functions through departments and agencies is meant to govern, and not to harass or intimidate. 

Home Minister Amit Shah’s candid [admission](https://www.news18.com/india/kyon-pareshan-ho-rahe-ho-modi-ka-naam-de-do-amit-shah-recalls-real-misuse-of-agencies-rising-india-7418197.html) in a recent interview precisely illustrates the latter point. Speaking from personal experience, he narrated how the Congress-led UPA government unfairly framed him:

“I will tell you how agencies are misused, I have been a victim of it…In 90 per cent of the questions during my interrogation…they said they would leave me if I name Narendra Modi…An SIT was formed against Modi which the Supreme Court itself dismissed…In my entire interrogation, I was told ‘Modi ka naam de do, de do \[give us Modi’s name\]. But why should I frame him? Because of me, several innocent police officers were put in jail.”

It is now common knowledge that the Congress ecosystem exiled Amit Shah from Gujarat for months on end. One shudders to imagine what his fate would have been had the BJP lost the 2014 polls.

But recent history informs us that what Amit Shah said in the interview is nothing terribly new. He was just one of the latest and high-profile victims of the habitual Congress tyranny, which predates India’s independence. A period in which the Congress was not even a political party fighting elections. This ugly saga will be narrated in multiple episodes at a later date.

When India got independence, it was actually the Nehru dynasty that acquired a Government for itself. The seven-decade-long record of this “Government” is distinguished by an utter absence of *governance.* And this absence could only be sustained by a chequered reign of terror carried out primarily through a flagrant abuse of Government agencies. In fact, a multi-volume research work documenting *all* such cases of Congress abuse awaits the Indian public.

At a distance so far in time, it might be surprising to learn that as early as in 1948, the widespread public perception was that Indians were [better off](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/history/what-the-archives-tell-us-the-congress-was-hated-not-loved-after-independence) under British rule than the new Congress “government.” In those days, the Congress routinely used the dreaded colonial Internal Security Act (then in force in provincial British Governments) to stifle ordinary citizens who were mildly critical of its functioning. Measures [included](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/the-dead-bodies-that-cemented-the-invisible-nazism-of-the-nehruvian-congress-governments) illegal detentions, police torture, and extra judicial murders. Indira Gandhi’s notorious MISA was simply a more brutalised version of the aforementioned Act.

This untrammelled abuse of power led Sarat Chandra Bose (Subhash Bose’s brother) to thunder in Bombay in 1948:

After ten months of existence, India has produced a maimed and crippled baby without much sign of life…We have copied in every detail the example of the British. The repressive ordinances, acts and regulations of the British have all been made into law to-day… **What is most shameful is that these repressive measures are far more stringent than the British ever dared to take… Free speech, association and assemblies are things of the past**. (Emphasis added)

Likewise, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya’s son, Radhakant Malviya, then a member of the Constituent Assembly openly declared how the Congressmen and their friends "who evade taxes are the very ones who are feted as patriots and honoured.”

## **The Tragedy of Pandit Lekhraj Sharma**

JUST ONE RANDOM INSTANCE of the Congress Party’s hideous misuse of the official machinery illustrates the rotten mindset and devious nature that informed this abuse.

Ever heard of Pandit Lekhraj Sharma from Ajmer?

Neither had I until I dug out the archives of the freedom struggle and its aftermath in 1947.

In his teens, Lekhraj Sharma had dedicated himself to the Indian freedom struggle and was a lifelong devotee of Mohandas Gandhi. He sincerely believed in the Great Democrat, Nehru’s long-winded and passionate speeches about open debate, democracy and other noble ideas, and toiled as a loyal Congressman.

Tragically, he believed that the Congress Government of independent India actually conducted itself on these ideals. He would pay for his naïveté in a gruesome fashion.

In January 1948, he decided to contest the Bombay municipal elections. And his nightmare began on 7 February 1948.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5c7c9ea-fd34-4a51-9cd9-92e5b7c3825b_1536x1024.png)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5c7c9ea-fd34-4a51-9cd9-92e5b7c3825b_1536x1024.png)

THE BOMBAY POLICE LANDED at his doorstep and arrested Lekhraj Sharma as part of its persecution-spree after Mohandas Gandhi’s assassination. He was taken to the Bombay C.I.D. headquarters. In the dingy interrogation room, a sudden, unexpected blow landed on his body even as he was being interviewed by the C.I.D. chief. More blows followed as he fell down from his chair. The police inspector who was mercilessly thrashing him, bound his hands from behind and pushed his knee on his back grinding him frontally on the hard floor. He yanked Lekhraj Sharma’s moustache, knocked off his Gandhi topi and trampled on it. Humiliation. Helplessness. Cornered, like a caged animal.

On 11 February, Lekhraj Sharma received a written police order that said that he was being detained under the selfsame Security Measures Act. The police had displayed great creativity in cooking up the charge: Lekhraj Sharma was henceforth declared “communal-minded.” His letters of appeal to the Home Minister of Maharashtra and to Sardar Patel himself, never reached them.

Lekhraj Sharma was held in illegal detention without trial till 7 May 1948.

And then, he was freed, as suddenly as he had been arrested. The reason: the Bombay Municipal elections had been concluded.

The devoted Congressman Pandit Lekhraj Sharma had committed the crime of contesting against the candidate fielded by the ”great freedom fighter” and the “uncrowned king of Bombay,” S.K. Patil.

The entire administrative machinery had cravenly knelt before S.K. Patil in persecuting a helpless, defenceless Gandhian patriot. It was not even necessary to declare an Emergency in 1948.

NEEDLESS, THE EMERGENCY GAVE official sanction to official abuse given that there was no such thing as Government. One of the best descriptions of this despotic phenomenon was given by a Congressman himself. The notorious Bansi Lal, then described as the “scourge of Haryana,” haughtily flaunted the real source of his power when he publicly declared: “bachada mere kabze mein hai. Gau-maata apne aap mere peeche aayegi — I have taken possession of the Calf and naturally the Cow is always at my beck and call.” The calf was Sanjay Gandhi and the cow, his mother, the Prime Minister of India. It was also not coincidental that the Congress election symbol back then was the cow and the calf. Indira Gandhi learned of this remark but remained silent. Bansi Lal’s stint as Defence Minister was also marked by rampant corruption scandals and brazen misuse of the Haryana official machinery in service of Sanjay Gandhi’s pet “Maruti project.”

Packing India’s prisons with leaders of the entire Opposition was of course the ultimate perversion of Governmental authority.

But beyond the specific cases, the intrinsic mindset and the innate goal of this perversion is where we find an answer.

## **Nawab Nehru as a Self-Confessed Dictator**

IN A 1937 ARTICLE titled *Rashtrapati* published in the Calcutta-based journal, *Modern Review,* Jawaharlal Nehru imputed to himself all the traits of a dictator and concluded that “we want no Caesars.” The original pronunciation of the Anglicised “Caesar” is “Kaiser,” meaning “despot,” “dictator,” etc. We all know how the world burned due to German Kaiserism, a bloody phenomenon which occurred during Nehru’s radioactive years in politics and public life. Nehru wrote this article under a pseudonym that reeks of irony: *Chanakya*.

Given some of the more shocking revelations from the overall Nehruvian crypt, we can conclude in hindsight that the aforementioned article is a study in classic narcissism. A vainglorious love letter he penned to himself. Here is how an excerpt reads:

Watch him again. There is a great procession and tens of thousands of persons surround his car and cheer him in an ecstasy of abandonment**. He stands on the seat of the car, balancing himself rather well, straight and seemingly tall, like a god,** serene and unmoved by the seething multitude. Suddenly there is that smile again, or even a merry laugh, and the tension seems to break and the crowd laughs with him, not knowing what it is laughing at. He is godlike no longer but a human being claiming kinship and comradeship with the thousands who surround him and the crowd feels happy and friendly and takes him to its heart.

Is all this natural or the carefully thought out trickery of the public man? Perhaps it is both and long habit has become second nature now…**With his seeming carelessness and insouciance, he performs on the public stage with consummate artistry.** **Whither is this going to lead him and the country?…** These questions would be interesting in any event, for **Jawaharlal is a personality which compels interest and attention… Men like Jawaharlal, with all their capacity for great and good work, are unsafe in democracy**…**A little twist and Jawaharlal might turn a dictator sweeping aside the paraphernalia of a slow-moving democracy**… Jawaharlal cannot become a fascist. And yet he has all the makings of a dictator in him…with all his love of the crowd, an intolerance of others and a certain contempt for the weak and the inefficient...

We have a right to expect good work from him in the future. Let us not spoil that and spoil him by too much adulation and praise. His conceit is already formidable. It must be checked. We want no Caesars.(Emphasis added)

Reading this today feels surreal. But it is also a representative essay in which we can trace the psychological origins of the decadal Nehruvian abuse of Government machinery. The abuse was merely the consequence that flowed from such a psyche. In 1937, nobody in the Congress had even dreamed that India would get freedom in just a decade. Yet, here was Nehru anonymously glorifying himself in the third person and worrying that his self-professed greatness would transform him into a dictator. To put it bluntly, it appears that Nehru had convinced himself so early that he was born to rule, and not govern.

But if anybody qualifies to the title of dictator in recent Indian history, it is Sanjay Gandhi. Both Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi couldn’t go the whole hog because they were constrained and were prudent enough to realise not to overstep these limits. The ex-Communist writer and intellectual, Philip Spratt — Nehru’s contemporary — has given perhaps the best assessment of Nehru as a shackled Communist dictator:

The figure in world politics who most resembles \[Nehru\] is \[Fidel\] Castro. Castro got into power on false pretences. i.e. as a liberator, not as a Communist, but within a year or so he had liquidated his opponents and built up the Communists so far that he was able to drop the mask. **Nehru got into power on the same false pretences**, i.e. as a liberator… and he has proceeded in the same direction, but far more cautiously. Castro succeed Batista; **Nehru succeeded Gandhi on the one hand, and the legalistic British regime on the other.** **The two legacies between them have cramped his Communist style.** Nehru has sometimes sighed for a cadre such as Mao Tse-tung built up during the Long March. **But such a cadre, while it might have enabled him to enforce Communism, would not have made it any more congenial to India**…Communism remains wholly alien to this conservative, religious, individualistic, property-conscious, peasant-minded country. (Emphasis added)

A timeless wisdom informs us that a dictator’s power is almost wholly derived from and sustained by his yes-men. Nehru adopted a three-pronged device during his early bid to consolidate power.

The first was to pack his inner circle with family, unvarnished sycophants and ideological comrades. To this list belong Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Brijmohan “Bijji” Koul, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, V.K. Krishna Menon, Kidwai, et al.

The second was to expel any challengers to his power by using a time-tested tactic: humiliation. Some among these challengers had been his close friends who had helped him in difficult times. Others were light years ahead of him in eminence and accomplishment, a fact he knew better than others. The shameful episodes detailing how he heartlessly ejected C. Rajagopalachari, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and John Mathai don’t make for easy reading even today.

The third was his trump card. Each time he found the heat unbearable — criticism from his cabinet members, the opposition, etc., — he held out the ultimatum of resignation. And it worked each time. Opeds and fawning international media coverage would immediately materialise, with headlines like *After Nehru, who? Who can Step into Nehru’s Shoes?* and so on. How is this fundamentally different from a similar media coverage that Rahul Gandhi keeps getting — as a saviour of democracy, as a warrior against authoritarianism, etc?

THESE YES-MEN DRAWN from varied cesspools and pursuing their own private agendas were only too aware of their importance if not indispensability to Nehru. And he let them run their little enterprises by feigning blindness, a fact that Spratt mentions in the same article:

**An item of \[Nehru’s\] policy… is his tolerance of corruption**… Nehru has the same bohemian attitude towards audit objections: they belong to the fussy bourgeois era of Gokhale and Gandhi… When the resolution on the socialistic pattern was passed at Avadi, an important Congressman compared it to the Emperor Akbar’s Din Ilahi. Socialism, he said, is Nehru’s personal fad, which will quickly be forgotten when he passes from the scene. It seemed a shrewd judgement at the time, **but it overlooked the attraction of socialism for a ruling party of hungry careerists**. (Emphasis added)  

From the discussion so far, it is clear that it would be limiting to view the Congress misuse of power as being restricted only to harassment by official agencies.

To cite another random example, we have the [foul hounding](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/subverting-the-true-history-of-india-how-jawaharlal-nehru-and-his-cronies-sidelined-prof-r-c-majumdar) of one of India’s tallest historians, R.C. Majumdar. His only crime was his professed devotion to write the full truth about Nehru and Gandhi’s roles in the freedom struggle. Majumdar’s stature was slandered and his career, ruined. The witch hunt was frontally led by Maulana Azad and some high-ranking bureaucrats, a saga that Majumdar has himself recounted.

Naturally, the quality of yes-men in the post-Nehru years coarsened, and just as naturally, paved the path to the criminalisation of Indian politics. Now, the agencies were unleashed at whim to settle personal or political scores by individual legislators. It was no longer necessary for the hounding order to come from the very top.

The familiar argument that Indira Gandhi was primarily responsible for the destruction of democratic institutions is true only in a limited sense. Jawaharlal Nehru had already primed the field. She harvested the venomous crop.

THE IDEOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND POLICY SIDE to the wrecking of the government machinery is a thread that is interwoven with this venal legacy. Nehru’s addiction to softcore Communism translated as intractable hatred for free enterprise, which obviously impoverished businesses. Which further meant that there was not enough money to go around. Which also meant an endless spiral of taxes. However, for the Congress, this translated into paucity of funds to finance its poll campaigns. That was when the now-ubiquitous *Brahmastra* was deployed: threatening businesses with tax raids. The late Nani Palkhivala has given us the most lucid and the most detailed treatises on this sick phenomenon in his masterly *We the Nation* and *We the People.* It is a miracle how India actually lifted itself up from this muck.

Even as recently as 2012-13, Arun Shourie had made a cryptic remark when the former CAG Vinod Rai was dragooned by the Congress-led UPA regime for exposing their serial skulduggeries. Shourie said that Rai had taken the Congress by surprise by his exposes because all the while they had thought, “yeh hamara aadmi hai” — he is our man. In other words, they viewed Vinod Rai as a traitor. 

And so, when Amit Shah narrated his ordeal at the hands of — to borrow his words, “Chidambaram, Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” it is clear that he was severely understating and downplaying the case. What the Congress has historically done is not abuse of power or misuse of agencies: it exercised quasi dictatorship.

The Emergency simply gave India its full taste.
