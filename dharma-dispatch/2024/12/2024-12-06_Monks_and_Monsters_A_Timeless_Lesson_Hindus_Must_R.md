History is one of the most powerful and integral weapons in the never-ending imperialist project of converting the whole world into *Dar ul Islam.* In fact, with few exceptions, history written by Muslim chroniclers is just one ongoing record of Islam’s victories over Kaffirs all over the world ever since Prophet Muhammad seeded the project, and that cult is very scrupulous in this regard.

Hindus show the exact and extreme opposite picture in this area. Civilizational amnesia and not historical memory, seems to be the eternal curse cast upon the Hindu psyche especially beginning with the period of Muslim rule in medieval India. Koenraad Elst’s two valuable books, *History Versus Casuistry* and *Ayodhya: The Case Against the Temple* explore various dimensions of this curse in a rather detailed and insightful manner.

What was true thirty years ago when the Babri Masjid fell is truer today: a venal cabal addicted to a genocidal ideology masquerading as historians are directly responsible for its demolition. Leading the pack undoubtedly are Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib, D.N. Jha, & gang. Their criminal record is well-known to most people today so we don’t need to belabor that point further.

Clearly, these were gangsters who passed off as historians for the majority of the period after “independence.”

If this was not enough, they had also fine-tuned the dark art of making inconvenient books disappear. As the Rama Janmabhoomi Movement intensified, the evidence in *favour of* the earlier existence of a Hindu Temple on the site began to mount. What was even worse for these gangsters was the fact that copious Muslim primary sources unambiguously, *proudly* recorded the temple destruction.Especially noteworthy was a work titled Publication No. 66 of the *Majlis Tehqiqat wa Nashriat Islam*, the publication house of the Nadwatul-Ulama, Lucknow. The book itself was not remarkable but one chapter scared the juices out of the Marxist gangsters of history.
