AT THE OUTSET, *The Dharma Dispatch* wishes all its readers a happy, healthy and prosperous 2024. In September 2023, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of launching our sacred initiative dedicated to serving the Sanatana cause.

These five years have been an eventful journey involving much learning, insights, and the sheer joy of digging into and offering rare stories and other content from the inexahustible treasure-trove of the Sanatana annals. The response from *you,* our readership, has only grown by leaps and bounds. We continue to receive much affection and unstinted support from all corners of the global Hindu community and from all strata of society. It has been a slow process but we believe we have built lasting relationships with our subscribers over these years. So, once again, *a heartfelt note of gratitude to everyone who have been a part of our journey.*

As you are aware, *The Dharma Dispatch* is *entirely* funded, supported and sustained by its subscribers. Our dedication to preserve and pass on the profound values that built the Hindu civilisational complex has only deepened with each year and our resolve to fight forces that are hostile to it has also simultaneously strengthened. We have made a *conscious choice not to accept corporate funding or advertising* so that we can remain truly free to publish the content that we hold dear to our heart.

And so, as we step into 2024, we once again seek your support in helping us sustain this sacred endeavour. It takes us weeks of focussed research, loving writing and rigorous editing and *significant costs* to offer this labour of love. Your support will only help us offer more back to the global Hindu community.
