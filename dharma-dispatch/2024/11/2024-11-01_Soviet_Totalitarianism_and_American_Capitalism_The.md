"THE SOVIET UNION too has an idea. Totalitarianism. She has polished and perfected it over the years. She is passionately dedicated to it. She wants this idea to prevail permanently, for, without it, she sees no hope for humanity. And she also spends billions to spell and secure it in every corner of the world.

"What does she do? She propounds that the standard of living and much more follow from faith in totalitarianism. She elaborates the idea in an unending stream of books, pamphlets, posters, handbills, and films, produced in every language and suited to the lowest intelligence and the meanest pocket. She employs an army of men and women to retail this idea on a mass scale in order to convert or corrode as many people as possible, and to ultimately impose it with force of arms in true crusading fashion.

"The material conditions may differ from Czechoslovakia to Albania to Tibet. But they are all equally ripe for totalitarianism. The triumphal march of an idea does not and should not depend on any material preparation. The idea cannot and should not wait for slow and stupid material changes. What the idea needs is human minds, their craving for it. The minds can be captured and the craving created by means of books and the party apparatus.

"Nor does the Soviet Union seek for any credentials of power or prestige in choosing her friends. All she cares for is their convictions. Let the convinced ones be obscure and unknown. She makes them famous overnight by powerful publicity. Let the convinced ones be poor. She makes them prosperous by placing them in her paid hierarchy. *Let the convinced ones be hated by their own people. She makes them loved by discovering in them virtues which no one ever suspected.*

"*If you can turn a phrase, you can be turned into a world famous author, without your ever bothering to write a line.* People everywhere will be informed by the Soviet network that your wonderful works are under translation. Royalties on enormous editions will come pouring into your pocket. And so on, you can be a renowned scientist, or doctor, or lawyer, or musician, or poet, or priest, as it suits your taste, and go about as an honoured guest in every capital of the world. All you have to do is to believe in and seek for totalitarianism, and the rest in added unto you.

"This is not Dialectical Materialism. This is Idealism, according to which consciousness converses with consciousness as one lamp is lighted by another, ideas implement ideas, and one human mind meets another, directly without any material aid. In this universe, the ill-fed and ill-clad underdogs have as much capacity as their more privileged fellow-beings. For, this is the universe of freedom, and of faith."

There was another pause. I was too flabbergasted to offer any comment.

After a while, the swami himself resumed:

"You were talking of peaceful coexistence. I do not know what that phrase really means. *What I see before my eyes is a neat division of labour between the United States and the Soviet Union, at least in this part of the world.* *The United States is trying to take care of our bodies, our hearths, and our homes. The Soviet Union is taking care of our heads*, and showing extreme concern for our mental, moral and spiritual needs.

"The United States builds schools and spreads literacy among the peasants. The Soviet Union provides them the newspapers they read. The United States erects factories in which the workers can earn a livelihood. The Soviet Union bands them into trade unions, trains their leaders, and *gives them a cause to die for*. The United States gives scholarships to promising students for studies abroad. The Soviet Union equips them with political glasses through which they can survey the world. The United States builds hospitals and furnishes them with soft beds and rare medical supplies. The Soviet Union indoctrinates the nurses who attend and attract the patients. The United States spends on library premises. The Soviet Union stocks the shelves within with her own choice of literature. The United States pampers regime after regime with the paraphernalia for pomp. The Soviet Union creates an elite capable of possessing power in every land..."

The swami looked at his watch, and stood up. He was now in a hurry. I accompanied him to the nearest bus stand, and shot my only question at him: 'Why do you think Dialectical Materialism is a sin?' He raised his eyebrows, looked grim, and whispered:

"I am a man of God. I have seen Him face to face, even as I see you. I know He is pure, unmixed Consciousness. Self-existing, All-sustaining and Blissful Consciousness."

And then suddenly pointing his well-shaped finger towards a heap of dirt, he roared: "*Dialectical Materialism says that Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein evolved out of that filth.* That is blasphemy. And a sin. A cardinal sin."

I woke up with a start. There was no swami, no bus stand, and no heap of dirt. Instead, I lay in a bed scattered with the writings of the Right Reverend Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Perhaps I had been bored to an early doze by his bad paraphrase of communist scriptures.

## Epilogue

THAT IS HOW Sita Ram Goe's brilliant essay concludes. More than a mere essay, it is an outcome of profound contemplation. More than three decades later, he added an epilogue of sorts to it, which is notable for its Goelesque sucker-punch. The punch is also a handy guide for those who wish to follow the path he laid down in order to effectively combat and defeat all these nihilistic, soul-crushing and civilisation-destroying ideologies.

<div class="pullquote">

**India is the home of SanÃ¢tana Dharma, a world-view which is at once eternal and universally valid.** All other spiritual world-views have imprisoned themselves within the confines of a particular book, or a particular prophet, or a particular church.

**SanÃ¢tana Dharma alone rises above all sectarian semantics and sophistry, and takes us straight into that sunshine of the Supreme Spirit** which has sanctioned the rise and spread of Communism, and which will sanction its death and destruction as well.

**Let the spirit of SanÃ¢tana Dharma re-awaken and spread once more in the land of its first though immemorial dawns**. Let us look at Pandit Nehru and his hoodlums from the vantage point of that spirit. Then we shall see immediately as to who is the arch-villain in this dismal drama, and stop wasting our time and energy in weeping and whining against mere minions like Comrade Krishna Menon.

This attitude, this spirit and this call to energetic action is eminently relevant today more than ever, and will remain so till the aforementioned arch-villains are put in their proper place.
