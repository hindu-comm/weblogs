</div>

IN A RECENT DISCUSSION IN AN ONLINE FORUM, some participants made an important observation, whose essence can be summed up as what they called “a defeatist victimhood mindset on the part of Hindus” in face of the relentless, vicious and no-holds-barred, unscrupulous attacks against anything remotely to do with Hindus emanating from the usual suspects belonging to the Left Liberal Tablighis. The essence of the aforementioned defeatist mindset translated in real life is how Hindus are constantly operating from a defensive standpoint and spending all their time countering the Left Liberal attacks instead of operating from a position of strength.

As with any issue, the truth always lies in the very fundamentals, which we can easily verify through study and experience. Spelling errors can be easily fixed. But if we get the grammar itself repeatedly wrong, then the problem is with the language training we’ve received. And so it is in this case.

On a very fundamental plane, what is known as victimhood is a state of the psyche. In the real world, *Hindus are history’s greatest victims in terms of the sheer scale, duration and intensity with which they have been subjected to unspeakable horrors and genocides*…a sorry state of affairs that continues unabated till date.

However, there’s a key difference between being a victim and victimhood. Victimhood means that a person has accepted defeat without fighting the war despite having the best weapons at his command. Akin to the unconquerable warrior Arjuna who goes all the way to Indra and obtains all sorts of brilliant arsenal only to develop a weakness of the spirit right before the battle is about to begin. In a comparatively better era, he had Sri Krishna, the peerless guide and guru. Today, Hindus need to become their own Krishnas and Arjunas rolled in one. The alternative is total annihilation.

[DONATE TO THE DHARMA DISPATCH](https://pages.razorpay.com/DonatetoDD)

Here is one more fundamental point verifiable in real life.

Consider the entire global cabal of Left Liberals.

Consider the actual numbers.

Take the Left Liberal headcount: *how many of them are there in total?* As in real people.

A lakh?

Two lakhs?

Five Lakhs?

Ten?

Twenty?

Assuming even twenty lakhs as the upper limit, consider this number in a population of about *130 crores*. That should give an accurate sense of proportion with respect to comparative strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, when was the first or last time anyone of us saw these seven-star intellectual Tablighis get down on the streets, get their hands dirty to do some meaningful work or service?

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a768f8b-bf17-47c0-b2fb-d2fd0cc09e0c_1112x629.jpeg)

</div>

Another eminently verifiable real-life fact is this: the Left Liberal Tablighis really excel at two things, primarily:

1.  Complete shamelessness and any lack of basic decency and restraint
    in public behaviour

2.  Amplifying their voice in order to get massive visibility, a tactic
    they have perfected over more than *seven* decades (do listen to
    [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N08hCDD7EUI) on how
    this was achieved). The kind of infrastructure that such a long span
    allows one to create is formidable and matchless.

The outcome of these two major factors cannot be underestimated. It is because of these that the proverbial ordinary Hindu (or masses) impute a kind of halo of intellectualism and omniscience to the Left Liberal Tablighis. The other point is their sheer doggedness…they emit their toxic vapours day in and out without pause thereby giving an impression that they’re some sort of courageous warriors for a good cause. All these taken in combination makes it hard to ignore them especially when they *appear* to be *everywhere.* Let’s take a recent example: one fails to understand why an obscure old roach like Arundhati Roy had to be resuscitated by *Hindus* when she was foaming her mouth off to an audience that was clearly worse than her. To put it bluntly, this is a knee-jerk reaction, which a person who is *fully conscious of and operates from a position of strength* doesn’t give.

Without ado, here are four main steps one can take to overcome and avoid what is described as a defeatist victimhood mindset.

## Step 1: Remember that the Hindu Civilisation is the the Greatest Creation of Spiritual Genius

<div id="§step-remember-that-the-hindu-civilisation-is-the-the-greatest-creation-of-spiritual-genius" class="header-anchor-widget offset-top">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button" href="https://thedharmadispatch.substack.com/i/137869000/step-remember-that-the-hindu-civilisation-is-the-the-greatest-creation-of-spiritual-genius">

</div>

</div>

</div>

Always remember that the Sanatana civilization and culture is the most sublime creation of undiluted genius. *It is superior to anything that had existed before or anything that exists at present or will exist in the future.* It cannot be replicated and can and *must* be preserved and enriched. It is the perennial Ganga that simply needs cleaning if we do really worship Ganga. How many buckets of water can we add to Ganga and make it “better?” The two major religions of the world are not religions because they lack something as basic as a worldview or even a view of life because they make highly unsustainable claims of both universal and eternal validity and predetermined infallibility all based on a book and an alleged prophet.

And if you’re still not convinced of the superiority of Sanatana Dharma, ask yourself just *two* questions:

1.  Would you like to be a Tablighi Jamaati guy?

2.  Would you like to be born in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia?

## Step 2: Self-Education

<div id="§step-self-education" class="header-anchor-widget offset-top">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button" href="https://thedharmadispatch.substack.com/i/137869000/step-self-education">

</div>

</div>

</div>

As much as possible, educate yourself on the *core aspects* of Sanatana Dharma. Lack of resources or accessibility to reliable knowledge sources or people in the present is the least of the barriers. The education must be a *lived education,* not merely book learning or intellectual acrobatics that lead nowhere.

## Step 3: Mockery is your Best Friend

<div id="§step-mockery-is-your-best-friend" class="header-anchor-widget offset-top">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button" href="https://thedharmadispatch.substack.com/i/137869000/step-mockery-is-your-best-friend">

</div>

</div>

</div>

Mock the Left Liberal Tablighis. Parody them. Caricature them. To blow my own trumpet, I think “Left Liberal Tablighi” is a decent coinage, it has a nice ring to it. Say it aloud. Use it freely. Coin your own. Mock. Taunt. Scorn. Jeer. Sneer. Ridicule. Pillory. Do all of the above and more but *never engage in a debate with them.* In the rare event that *they* invite you to a debate, tell them to their face that they’re an inferior species. Compare them to the lowest vermin you have encountered in your life. Tell them they are in need of lifelong therapy for a cocktail of mental illnesses. Use your full creative freedom.

</div>

<div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

## Step 4: Contempt Works. Always.

<div id="§step-contempt-works-always" class="header-anchor-widget offset-top">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button" href="https://thedharmadispatch.substack.com/i/137869000/step-contempt-works-always">

</div>

</div>

</div>

Left Liberal Tablighis are basically bullies because they are fanatics of tin pot theories and do not live in the real world. Substantial portions of these Tablighis are incurable drug addicts. Most of them don’t take bath or wash their underwear for months. They can’t tell you the result of 7 times 9. They can’t spell a word that has more than three syllables. They are unemployable and live off their aged parents or spouses and assault them if denied money. Some among this species are standup comedians who drink expensive liquor and eat overpriced food for free at the establishments where they put on their below-the-belt circus shows. I can add to this infinitely-expanding list but this is basically the gist.

So the way to treat them is with contempt. Naked, undisguised, in-your-face contempt. Do *not* have a *conversation* with them because that means you’re already taking them seriously. And so, along with mockery, use generous doses of contempt. Remember that they do not have even *opinions* because they are cult addicts *and* drug addicts.

We can stop here for now. Try these steps. It really works. It *will* equip you with the confidence needed to operate from a position of strength. From there onward, success will only breed success. Like good money chases only good money.
