THE OTHER FACE OF OUTRAGE IS GRATITUDE. And our gratitude is due to Udhayanidhi Stalin who recently unchained the hungry Dravidian ideological wolf which had never concealed its appetite for eradicating Sanatana Dharma.   

The Dravidian blood has indeed woefully thinned over three generations. Udhayanidhi is no match to his grandfather, the wily Karunanidhi who really *knew* how to play the game, and in the process, how to build a powerful and durable political empire and amass a transnational fortune.

In fact, Karunanidhi was the real deal — he not only surpassed his ideological daddy, E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, but did it by feigning a patina of respect for Sanatana Dharma, which his ideology seeks to obliterate. He had indeed mastered the art of doublespeak and doublethink. He could nonchalantly mock Sri Ramachandra by [questioning](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-is-this-ram-a-civil-engineer-when-karunanidhi-called-ramayana-fiction-2647294) his Engineering degree and with the same elan, invite Vedic priests from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam to [bless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpjuczAN2DM) his home. Not a single DMK party member or anyone from his Dravidian ideological universe batted an eyelid.

But from the beginning till the end of his blighted life, E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (EVR) remained firmly mired in his exterminate-Sanatana Dharma sludge. To this extent, Udhayanidhi Stalin remains his devout adherent. He is the first Dravidian ideologue and a legatee of a powerful political family to openly express his intent to “eradicate Sanatana Dharma” decades after EVR did so.

And so, it behooves us to briefly examine EVR’s copious record in this matter. Fortunately, we don’t need to work too hard.

E.V.R.’s quasi-biography in English titled *Collected Works of Periyar E.V.R,* compiled by K. Veeramani is widely available. And there’s just no polite way of saying it: the book reads like an unapologetic Compendium of Hindu hatred. There is nothing that E.V.R does not hate. He hates Dharma, he hates “Aryans,” he hates Brahmins, he hates the Veda, he hates the Dharmasastras, he hates the Ramayana, he hates the Mahabharata, he hates the Bhagavad Gita, he hates the Puranas, he hates Rama, he hates Sita, he hates Krishna, he hates Shiva, he hates Vishnu, he hates Brahma, he hates Valmiki, he hates Vyasa, he hates Kamban, he hates the Alwars, he hates the Nayanmars, he hates Gandhi, he hates Nehru, he hates Rajagopalachari…

The book is also a user manual containing precise instructions aimed at a comprehensive destruction of Sanatana Dharma. Only a sample will suffice. This was in a speech as recent as 1973.

“**Wherever we see a temple, we must go inside and break all the idols inside. Wherever we find a Paapaan** \[pejorative for Tamil Brahmanas\], **we must kill and destroy him**… If one non-Brahmin Tamil dies while trying to kill one Tamil Brahmin, only three of us will die out of every hundred. Ninety-four per cent of us will still remain but **Tamil Brahmins will be eliminated.** We will definitely go to this level.” 


The instructions were derived from E.V.R’s protracted career of practically vandalising Santana Dharma in ways too copious to recount here. However, Veeramani’s putrid tome gives us a handy guide in this regard. He glorifies E.V.R’s sustained vandalism of Hindu Dharma as “great milestones” in his career.

Here are some of those “milestones,” excerpted from the book.

## “Milestones” in E.V.R’s Career

1921-22 — Periyar declared that he would burn ‘Manusmiruthi’, ‘Ramayana’, etc., because these had been utilised by the wily Brahmins, as their religious weapons to suppress the Dravidian race.

1924 — Periyar appreciated the measures of the Justice Party Government for implementing the policy of Communal Reservation in education and employment through Government Order. Speaking at a public meeting at Salem, Periyar cautioned that unless the right of communal representation for the Non Brahmins was attained during the British Rule itself, the Brahmin supremacy could not at all be ended and the Dravidian race had to suffer under the tyranny of ‘BRAHMNOCRACY.’ Thus he even coined that new word.

1925 — While bidding farewell to the Congress, Periyar thunderously vowed that his only future task was to destroy Brahmin Raj by all means. At Kancheepuram, Periyar organised shortly a parallel conference of Non-Brahmins. In his address, Periyar declared that the difference of racial identity between the Dravidians and the Aryans (Brahmins) had always been existing from very ancient times…

1925 — Periyar met the Congress leader M.K. Gandhi at Bangalore. He also emphatically told Gandhi that before fighting for the freedom of India, three threatening evils - viz., (1) The Congress Party (Under the command of more Brahmin office - bearers), (2) Hindu religion with its caste - system and (3) the Dominance of Brahmins in the society should be put an end to first.

1929 — In Russia (formerly Soviet Union) his stay was extended for a lengthy period of three months because he was invited to address many workers’ meetings. Being the First Nation of Karl Marx’s Communism, established by the great leader Mr. Lenin, the former Soviet Union (Russia) captivated very much the heart of Periyar.

1935 — Periyar’s Reform of Alphabets in Tamil language was adopted in all the papers and books published by him.

1936 — In the conference held at Kanchipuram he arranged a resolution to be passed to oppose Hindi imposition.

1937 — At Truchirappalli, ‘Tamils Conferance’ was convened. There Periyar declared that to defeat the dominance of Hindi over Tamil and Dravidian race, the only solution would be ‘A separate Sovereign State,’ i.e., ‘Tamil Nadu for Tamils’.

1940 — He raked up the issue of the demand for a separate Dravida Nadu to save Dravidian race and Tamil language from the dominance of Hindi and North Indian Hindu Capitalists at Thiruvarur Conference.

1944 — On 27-8-1944 the name of the Justice Party was changed as ‘Dravidar Kazhagam’ to signify purely as a social revolutionary movement for the emancipation of Dravidian race oppressed by Brahmins at the Provincial (special) Justice Party conference held at Salem.

1947 (August 15) — When the whole of India and the world were jubilant on the attainment of Indian “Independence” on 15-8-1947, **Periyar boldly called it a ‘mourning’ day for Tamils** with foresight. **He called Independence of India was nothing but a ‘made over’ to Brahmins and North Indian Merchants (Baniyas)** from British **because the demand for separate sovereign nation to Dravidian Tamils was not fulfilled as done in the case of Muslims’ demand for Pakistan.**

1947 — On 14-9-1947, the Dravida Nadu separation conference was held at a moffusil town, Cuddalore.

1948 — On 30-1-1948 Mr. Mahathma Gandhi fell a victim to the bullets of assassin Nathuram Godse, a Marathi Brahmin at New Delhi at his prayer meeting. Periyar condemned the assasination at all meetings held thereafter in Tamil Nadu. He suggested that India be named as “Gandhi Nation (Nadu)”, a new religion with rationalism may be created as “Gandhi Religion” to mark his martyrdom.

1949 — Periyar’s marriage with Mani Ammai was held just to guard his health. (Editor’s note: E.V.R was seventy years old when he married her. She was thirty-two.)

1949 — He declared the Republic Day, 26-1-1950, as a Mourning Day for Tamils to condemn the oppressive rule of North Indian Capitalist Hindi fanatics.

1952 — In order to condemn idolatory worship and to show to the world that there was no divine power in idols, he organised a campaign. **His followers and himself broke the idol of PILLAIYAR (Vinayaga) at public places.**

1954 — Periyar… met… Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. He conversed with the latter for a long time and the subject of conversion to Buddhism came up for the discussion. He strongly advised Dr. B.R. Ambedkar not to leave Hinduism; because by his conversion to Buddhism he would forfeit his right to criticise Hinduism and its untouchability. **Periyar did not prefer conversion so that he could sustain the right to condemn the evils of Hindu religion.**

1954 **—** Periyar announced and fixed a date to set fire to the Indian National Flag… Periyar was arrested for his public agitation of burning the pictures of Rama at all public places, as a symbolic protest against the Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leaders according to the Ramayana epic.

1957 — For criticising the judgement of Madras High Court delivered by two Brahmin Judges… Periyar was charged with contempt of court and when the final hearing was heard, he made a statement in the High Court, explaining how Brahmins conducted themselves with racial motive in several cases and opined that it was their inborn natural ‘Dharma’ (Divine Duty) to annihilate uprising Shudras and Panchamas of Dravidian Race.

1957 — On 3-11-1957 at Thanjavur a big conference was held to weigh Periyar against silver coins to commemorate his birthday.

1957 — A resolution was passed calling upon the people of Tamil Nadu to come forward to burn the excerpt of Articles in the Constitution of India. Some 10,000 people burnt the excerpts of the Constitution of India.

1957 — Another big agitation was started by Periyar. Brahmins used to inscribe the name in their Hotel Name-Boards as ‘Brahmin Hotel’ to spread the impression that Brahmins were superior caste. Periyar requested all his followers to erase the name ‘Brahmin’ in the Hotel Name Boards. Accordingly a compaign was started to erase the Brahmin-Name-Board in all Brahmin Hotels in Tamil Nadu. As a result of this agitation, **the name ‘Brahmin’ in the hotel name-boards disappeared**.

1958 — Periyar was arrested as a case was foisted on him by the Govt. of Tamil Nadu that **he exhorted his followers to physically attack the Brahmins** in his speeches delivered at Pasupathipalayam (Karur), Kulitalai and Tiruchirapalli.

1959 — He burnt the map of India excluding Tamil Nadu, explaining that the Central Government Raj (Rule) is a Brahmin Raj. 

1959 — C.N. Annadurai became the Chief-Minister of Tamil Nadu, his party (DMK) having secured the majority of seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. **Annadurai declared in the State Assembly that he dedicated his ‘Ministry’ to Periyar**.

1968 — As a true rationalist disciple of Periyar the Chief Minister Anna directed to throw away the pictures of all Hindu deities from the Govt. offices through a circular signed by the then Brahmin Chief Secretary.

1968 — The Ramayana, Epic of Aryans, was burnt all over Tamil Nadu as a mark of protest against cruel treatment of Dravidians by the Aryans in the Ramayana.

## **Note**

THE AFOREMENTIONED list is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. It is provided in a spirit of public service to act as a ready reckoner of sorts to understand the psyche and motivations of E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker and the galling role that his activism has had in destroying the Hindu fabric of Tamil society and culture.
