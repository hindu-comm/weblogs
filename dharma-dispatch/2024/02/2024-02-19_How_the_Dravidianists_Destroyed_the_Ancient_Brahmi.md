THREE CONCLUSIONS immediately follow from Grant-Duff’s hate speech against Brahmins.

The first is the fact that he built upon Robert Caldwell’s original anti-Brahmin harangue just eleven years after it was published.

The second is his diabolical claim of a separate “national pride” of the “Dravidians.”

The third is his portrayal of the colonial British imperialism as a regime that was benevolent towards the “Dravidians.” In hindsight, the debt that we owe to the Mysore Princely State cannot be repaid. It acted as an extraordinary bulwark that largely prevented the Dravidian toxin from infecting Karnataka. As also the numerous Hindu royal kingdoms in Andhra of the time.

However, Grant Duff’s speech was sweet music to the ears of the nascent Dravidianists. Within a decade, there was a near explosion of various Tamil Sangams across the state, the most famous of which was at Madurai. It was lavishly funded by Pandi Thorai Thevar, a Zamindar of Palavanatham. It began publishing a new journal named*Sen Tamil*under the general editorship of V. Swaminatha Iyer. What began as an earnest effort at rediscovering a “pure” and “independent” Tamil heritage and culture morphed into linguistic zealotry at the end of the first decade of the last century. Ably aided by the Aryan Invasion fantasy, the notion of a separate Dravidian/Tamil identity, culture and language took incredibly strong roots in the minds of even honest scholars of both Sanskrit and Tamil. Those who refused to take part in this grand hoax were either marginalized or cowed down into brute submission by the aforementioned Dravidian sword-sharpeners.

F. R. Hemmingway, author of the*Tanjore Gazeteer*, gives a picturesque description[\[5\]](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/culture/how-the-real-life-drama-of-the-brahmin-and-sanskrit-hatred-of-caldwell-appas-brood-unfolded#_ftn5)of the cultural landscape of Thanjavur in 1906:

<div class="pullquote">

Brahmans versed in the sacred law are numerous in Tanjore; Vedic sacrifices are performed on the banks of its streams; Vedic chanting is performed in a manner rarely rivalled; philosophical treatises are published in Sanskrit verse; and religious associations exist, the privilege of initiation into which is eagerly sought for and**the rules of which are earnestly followed even to the extent of relinquishing the world**.

</div>

This would soon be a thing of the past.

One of the first casualties of Sanskrit learning was a traditional Gurukulam located in the ancient Kallidaikurchi Brahmin Agraharam falling in the jurisdiction of the Tirunelveli district. On the banks of the sacred, Tamraparni river sanctified by countless generations of Vedic scholarship and whose glories Muthuswami Dikshitar never tired of singing. The village is just 70 kilometres from Kanyakumari, whose majority population have long since become ghost-worshippers.

Around 1920-22, the Dravidian goon squad rudely descended on Kallidaikurchi on the pretext of raising an objection to the funds allocated for the Sanskrit College therein. The squad was led by the selfsame E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and his trusted lieutenant, P. Varadarajulu Naidu. Through a series of pitched agitations lasting about three years, Varadarajulu Naidu exhorted the non-Brahmins that the Gurukulam “was a direct challenge to the non-Brahmins and that…**this was the time for the Tamilians to vindicate their honour.”**

Naidu embarked on a blitzkrieg of incendiary speeches against Brahmins across Salem, Tirunelveli, and Mayavaram among other cities and towns. The outcome was entirely along expected lines: riots broke out and the Brahmins came to the negotiating table.

The head of the Gurukulam, V.V.S. Aiyer resigned.

With this, E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and gang had tasted blood. By 1925, when Ramaswami Naicker realized that Gandhi was an insurmountable obstacle in his unstoppable march towards unhinged Dravidianism, he quit the Congress and formed his own storm-trooping organization.

By then, the status of the supremacy of the Tamil language had acquired almost unchallengeable proportions. Throughout the Tamil regions, feverish efforts were underway to invent a new political vocabulary, which was “purely Tamil.” Among the more high-profile victims who fell for this linguistic-supremacy hoax was the former Diwan of Mysore, V.P. Madhava Rao. Here is how Irschick describes the scenario:

> At a Madras Congress Provincial Conference held at Cuddalore in 1917, > V. P. Madhava Rao, a Maharashtrian Brahman from Tanjore, pointed out that those who had spoken in Tamil at the meeting had demonstrated conclusively “the capacity of the Tamil language for the expression of ideas connected with administration, with law, and politics.”

It was one thing, and indeed it was the need of the hour to develop a native political vocabulary as a means to rouse the masses against the alien British rule. However, in the context of Tamil Nadu, this vocabulary would mean handing over ammunition to linguistic and racial separatism for which there was no basis in the long history of India. Which is exactly what the likes of V.P. Madhava Rao unleashed with his recommendation. The other notable name was that of “Right Honourable” V.S. Srinivasa Sastri who eventually capitulated to the demands of Tamil linguistic chauvinism. Exactly a year later, Varadarajulu Naidu launched a multi-city political tour. We can again turn to Irschickfor what occurred next:

<div class="pullquote">

Varadarajulu Naidu \[in his political tour\]… used only Tamil, and he effectively proved how valuable it could be as a political tool. At Negapatam \[Nagapattinam\], his first triumph, he attracted a huge crowd of workers from the railway shops. At Madura he spoke to millworkers—so vigorously, in fact, that he was arrested. He was convicted on the evidence of shorthand transcripts of his Tamil speeches… 

</div>

The same year that Ramaswami Naicker began his own political front, a Tamil scholarnamed M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, who was also secretary of the Tamil University Committee, “moved at a Justice \[Party\] Confederation in December, 1925, that the government should…grant to the Tamil districts a university to encourage the “growth of the Tamil language,” as well as the development of “historical consciousness among Tamilians.”

[Support The Dharma Dispatch](https://pages.razorpay.com/DonatetoDD)

His chorus was joined by T.N. Sivagnanam Pillai (Justice Minister of Development) who also demanded a separate Tamil University and alleged that Madras University was insulting Tamil by concentrating on Sanskrit, over which the “Aryas”, i.e., Brahmins held a monopoly. To be sure, the demand for a separate Tamil University was as old as 1916. After sustained activism, the university was established largely due to the decisive largesse bestowed by Sir Annamalai Chetti. In 1929, the Annamalai University was founded in the sacred temple town of Chidambaram.

However, it would still take more than two decades before the fate that befell Sanskrit and Vedic learning in Thanjavur and the Kallidaikurchi Gurukulam would befall other centers of Sanskrit learning in Tamil Nadu. It was just a question of when and not if.

Even as the Dravidians were chopping off the ancient Sanatana roots in Tamil Nadu with each successive decade, the larger society somehow held on to whatever remained of that sacred legacy. The brilliant scholar and writer, Dr. B.G.L. Swamy who served for over two decades in Presidency College Madras, notes that even in the 1940s, the Sanskrit Department comprised students who studied the B.A. and M.A. in the same classes irrespective of caste, class, and religious differences. However, this would be systematically erased in just about a decade.

One of the prefaces to this destruction took the form of a letterwritten by a Dravidianist named V. Radhakrishnan in July 1951. Here’s how it reads:

<div class="pullquote">

When a well-exploited language like Sanskrit is helped in such a bounteous way as the rewarding of rich scholarships and generous grants, surely Tamil, the language of the land, Tamil, the only hope for the reconstruction of South Indian History, deserves better treatment.**Sanskrit…is a dead language good only for keeping the Brahmans in the ascendant.**

</div>

As we shall see in the next part of this series, this theme of the supremacy of the Tamil language the preservation and propagation of which necessitated the massacre of Sanskrit unfolded in a disgusting manner, for example, in the Sanskrit Department of the Presidency College, Madras.
