> **When we think of ourselves as Sudras, we accept ourselves as the > sons of prostitutes.**

THAT WAS E.V. RAMASWAMI NAICKER, perhaps the first political hoodlum of pre-independence India and the patron saint of successive generations of*post*independence political goons. The fact that he is still hailed as “Periyar” (The Elder or Respected One) is more reflective of a celebration of the all-round destruction he inflicted upon Tamil Nadu. Given his long career, his overall legacy doesn’t remotely resemble decency or constructiveness with regard to Tamil Nadu or its culture.

One glance at the broad history of Tamil cinema offers innumerable and continuing proofs of this fact. Ramaswami Naicker achieved his perverse triumphs with greater speed and success where his senior and junior contemporaries had failed because he employed a simple device that these folks were hesitant to use: *the brazen employment of violent and obscene language in public*. Even in employing device, Ramaswami Naicker showed no originality. He directly plagiarized the tactics of Lenin who famously praised the effectiveness of “sticking the convict’s badge on your opponent” as a method of circumventing serious intellectual debate which he was destined to lose.

The calculated destruction of Sanskrit in Tamil Nadu was the direct and associative outcome of inveterate Brahmin-hatred espoused by the Dravidianists. From the start, the Dravidianists adopted a scorched earth policy of destroying everything that could remotely be considered Brahminical: Sanskrit language and literature and the temple culture naturally topped this hit list.

One of the most effective strawman opposition they found was Sanskrit; more specifically, Sanskrit*as opposed to*Tamil, Sanskrit as *an enemy* of Tamil.

Other arch villains of the so-called “Self-Respect Movement” and later the Justice Party, included J.N. Ramanathan, son of Nallaswami Pillai (author of*Sivajnana Bodham*), and J.S. Kannappar who had publicly burned copies of the Manusmriti in Madurai. These vandals quickly understood the power of organised violence.

Here, we hear an echo of a famous proverb regarding the successes of Islam in India and elsewhere:*while the Hindus and infidels were busy brushing up theological and philosophical arguments, the warriors of Islam were busy sharpening their swords.*And so, we had the Dravidianists busy writing inflammatory pamphlets and delivering provocative speeches against Brahmins, Sanskrit, Hindu Deities, Puranas, etc. One such vile pamphlet that appeared in 1929 was the*Visittira tevarkkal korttu*(The Wonderful Court of Hindu Deities). It used the literary device of a court of law in which revered Hindu Deities were put on trial and cross-examined for the various sexual and violent crimes they had committed against the non-Brahmins, and harsh punishments were imposed on these deities. It concluded that the entire Hindu “religion” was a mass of superstition and dismissed. The literary genius of Dr. S.L. Bhyrappa fleshes out the innate evil in this literary tactic—later adopted by Indian Leftists—with extraordinary finesse in his landmark novel,*Aavarana.*

Sure enough, riots and violence erupted in various parts of Tamil Nadu at regular intervals during the first two and half decades of the twentieth century thanks to these brazen actions of the Dravidianists.

Arguably, the Dravidianists couldn’t have achieved the kind of success they did without the tacit and at times, open support of the British, not to mention the Church which was rubbing its hands with glee at the kind of brood that Bishop Robert Caldwell had spawned. While Caldwell had the destruction of Brahmins in mind because they formed the chief obstacle to Christian soul-harvesting, he couched his destructive project primarily in linguistic terms from which he extrapolated the sociological equation that Brahmins=Aryas=Evil North Indian Invaders=Oppressors of Dravidians. The first ploy was to deny the reality that Tamil (or in his terms, “Dravidian languages”) was derived from Sanskrit. In fact, he went so far as to claim that Sanskrit had stolen from Tamil. In polite terms, this is how he put it:

<div class="pullquote">

Sanskrit has not disdained to borrow from its Dravidian neighbours…***Tamil, the most highly cultivated ab intra of all Dravidian idioms can dispense with its Sanskrit…and not only stand alone, but flourish, without its aid***…***a Tamil poetical composition is regarded as…classical, not in proportion to the amount of Sanskrit it contains…but in proportion to its freedom from Sanskrit**.*

</div>

Caldwell “appa’s” tract of hatred was quickly picked up by the Governor of Madras, the arch racist, Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff. In a flagrant address to the graduating students of the Madras University in 1886—three-fourths of who were Brahmins—he launched a frontal assaultagainst the entire Brahmin community of South India declaring that they, “the Brahmins are the real usurpers of social and literary superiority.” Then he pointed to the non-Brahmin graduates in the gathering and thundered:

<div class="pullquote">

You are of pure Dravidian race…**I should like to see the pre-Sanskrit element amongst you asserting itself rather more**.

The constant putting forward of**Sanskrit literature as if it were pre-eminently Indian, should stir the national pride of some of you Tamil, Telugu, Cannarese \[Kannada\]**.**You have less to do with Sanskrit than we English have.**Ruffianly Europeans have sometimes been known to speak of natives of India as ‘Niggers,’ but they do not, like the proud speakers or writers of Sanskrit, speak of the people of the South as legions of monkeys.**It was these Sanskrit speakers, not Europeans, who lumped up the Southern races as Rakshusas—demons**. It was they who deliberately grounded all social distinctions on Varna, Colour.*(Emphasis added)* 

</div>

Three conclusions become immediately clear from Grant-Duff’s hate speech against Brahmins.

*To be continued*
