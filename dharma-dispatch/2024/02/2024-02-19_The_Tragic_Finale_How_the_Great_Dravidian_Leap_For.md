IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE, we saw how a group of unwilling and untrained Sanskrit students fared miserably; and how they deployed the backward caste tactic and enlisted the support of the powerful cop who was on the board of examiners. The target of these students was the Sanskrit Pandit whose ouster they now demanded. The Principal of Presidency College, Madras, put his foot down.

However, the issue now took a life of its own, and finally reached its logical home: the Dravidianist politicians and ideologues. Uproarious debates erupted in the Legislative Assembly, University Senate, âpureâ Tamil organizations, and â*Veera*â (Warrior) Tamizh Associations.

As we have seen in the previous episodes, Dravidian tabloids had a phenomenal time denouncing âthe Aryan invaders from the north,â the vile Brahmins, and Sanskrit supremacists. After much furore, the following decision was ultimately reached: the Sanskrit Department must be upgraded. The reasoning they offered for this new proposal: âWhy should only one community teach Sanskrit? Is there a rule that other communities are prohibited from teaching Sanskrit?â

Among other things, the upgrade involved creating reservations for the following posts: the Sanskrit Department would now have a Chief Lecturer, three assistant lecturers and two Pandits. Qualifications were also amended: it was no longer necessary to have a Sanskrit degree (graduate or postgraduate); even novices in and âhobbyistsâ of Sanskrit could apply.

This was regarded as a major milestone in the Dravidianist version of[The Great Leap Forward](https://g.co/kgs/veQuW9). Of ensuring social justice by shattering bourgeoise rules of intentionally making it difficult to learn a language. According to this reasoning, Sanskrit would now be within the reach of everyone. By taking this revolutionary step, the Dravidianists claimed that they were actually making Sanskrit more accessible to a greater number of people.

This has a parallel in our own time. âPorombokeâ[T.M. Krishna](https://www.dharmadispatch.in/t-m-krishna-the-musical-urban-naxal/)took a leaf precisely from this revolutionary Dravidian step when he took Carnatic classical music literally to the gutters of Chennai. He claimed that this was his way of âliberatingâ classical music from âBrahmin oppression.â

BACK TO PRESIDENCY COLLEGE, MADRAS. According to the amended rules, these new posts were filled with eminences adorned with the following qualifications:

1.  A singer of dirges in Sanskrit and Tamil became the Chief Lecturer.

2.  A âpureâ Tamil loyalist who had been working as a Hindi Munshi in
    some school but had lost his job after the Tamil warriors inflicted
    a crushing blow on Hindi in the state. This Sanskrit lecturership
    was how the Dravidianist Government rehabilitated this ex-martyr
    of*Sen Tamizh.*

3.  A former P.A. of a former Dravidianist MP. This MP knew no other
    language than Tamil. And so, this P.A. rendered him loyal service
    each time he went to Delhi by acting as his translator in that
    wretched citadel of Aryan invaders. The P.A. lost his job the moment
    the MP lost his deposit in a recent election. But like his
    benefactor, he was also a committed Tamil warrior who had passed a
    Tamil language exam. The Government gave him the Sanskrit lecturer
    job.

4.  The fourth eminence was a self-taught Sanskritist who had learned
    the language using psychic powers. In his previous avatar, he had
    led an anti-Brahmin agitation. The Government gratefully rewarded
    him now.

The appointments were filled to the utmost satisfaction of the Dravidianist Government. The Sanskrit Department had been suitably upgraded.

It was now time to sharpen the sabre toimplement the Second Step of the Great Dravidianist Leap Forward. This was revising the Sanskrit syllabus.

Recall our friendly cop who had done such yeoman service to Sanskrit in Tamil Nadu? He was now back in action with greater gusto as a highly valued member of the syllabus revision committee. After detailed and elaborate deliberations spread over months and involving highly animated and sublime discussions, a unanimous consensus was reached: the existing syllabus wasâ¦*heavy.*It had to be made lighter and *student-friendly.*Else, no one would come forward to learn Sanskrit. Here are some highlights from the revised syllabus:

1.  *Rasagangadhara*of Jagannatha Panditaraja:**Delete**

2.  *Kavyaprakasha*of Mammata:**Delete**

3.  The second half of*Kadambari*by Banabhatta: âRetain half of the
    second half,â recommended the friendly cop.

4.  The origins of *Rasa*:**Delete**

5.  The*Panchama-Anka*(Fifth Act)of Kalidasaâs*Abhijnana
    Shakuntala.*The friendly cop exploded with fury when he heard this.
    He thundered, âBeware! Iâll throwâ¦I mean, the Government will throw
    into prison anybody who even utters the word,*Panchama*(another
    word for âDalitâ)!**The member who proposed this clarified
    patiently, â*Panchama-Anka*means the Fifth Act.â Friendly cop:
    âThatâs exactly what even Iâm saying! The *Act*, meaning, the law
    regarding the*Panchamas!*It is not necessary. Weâll replace it
    with the First Act. Our young students will be thrilled to read the
    romantic episodes between Dushyanta and Shakuntala.â**Agreed.**

6.  Vedas:**Retained**after much debate.

However, not one member of this new teaching faculty had learnt the Vedas in the traditional method. And so they appointed an intellectual lobbyist to the position of a Vedic Pandit. He had a smattering of Sanskrit but what really nailed his job was his qualification as a friend of the Dravidian ideology.

This luminary was tasked with teaching Vedic recitation to these newly recruited teachers. After six months of teaching, he realized his own limitations and in a rare flash of honesty, blessed them: âI have knowledge of Vedic recitation enough for reciting it myself. I havenât learnt how to teach it. I bless you all to become my Ekalavya disciples and practice Vedic recitation on your own.â The dutiful disciples followed his path but with a slight modification. One disciple was an accomplished singer of*Thevarams*(a traditional method of singing devotional hymns to Shiva). He began chanting the Vedic hymns in the *Jenjuti* Ragam set to the *Rupaka* Talam.

The Sanskrit Department âupgradeâ had predictable consequences. Within two years, the department had more teachers than students who leapt out to safety far away from this Great Dravidianist Leap Forward.

The most stinging indictment came from a student who had already come equipped with formidable pre-qualifications. Since childhood, he had traditionally learnt *Vyakarana* (Grammar), *Kavya* (Poetry), *Nataka* (Drama), etc. After attending a few classes at this department, he sought their blessings before bidding them farewell: âMy Most Revered Gurus, I have an earnest appeal. Please listen to it with benevolence. If I continue to study here any longer, I will forget what little Sanskrit I have learned so far. I will join another college and continue my Sanskrit studies there. You must kindly bless me.â

The flood of Sanskrit enthusiasts that the Great Dravidian Leap Forward had originally anticipated was now reduced to a solitary drop. And then it dried up completely. The Government asked the Sanskrit Department to justify the existence of so many teachers without any students. Those who saw the writing on the wall quickly activated their old lobbies and jumped to greener pastures. A couple of years later, the University issued a general order to upgrade the syllabi of all subjects including Sanskrit.

Except that there were no longer any takers for Sanskrit at Presidency College, Madras.
