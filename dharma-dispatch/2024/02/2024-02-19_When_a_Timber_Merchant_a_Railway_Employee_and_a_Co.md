*SHUDDHO - ASHUDDHO!*

That was the constant refrain in a circular issued by the Education Department of the Jyoti Basu Government in 1989 about the proposed changes to the history syllabus in the state. This is the summary of*Shuddho-Ashuddho:*all mentions of Muslim atrocities against Hindus during the period of Islamic rule were cast as*Ashuddho*(literally, impure) and had to be deleted; all mentions of the brave Hindu kings and warriors who fought them were also*Ashuddho.*This was the method of bestowing sainthood upon every Muslim despot starting from Mahmud of Ghazni all the way up to Aurangzeb.

But the Communists in West Bengal were at least three decades late to the game. The Dravidianists had implemented the*Shuddho-Ashuddho*schemeas early as the 1950s itselfin Tamil Nadu by labelling the Deva Bhasha, Sanskrit, as *Ashuddho.*The pristine “purity” of the Dravidian version of Tamil, like the jealous Abrahamic Gods, wouldn’t tolerate an equal, and therefore demanded a wholesale slaughter of Sanskrit.

It is one thing to merely*read*historical or contemporary accounts of wars and other tragedies. However, it is entirely a different thing to actually live or experience those horrors. Which is why our wise ancients gave this eternal caution:*Yuddhasya vaartaa ramyaa —* i.e., the narrative or story of a war is thrilling. What was left unsaid but implied was that direct experience of or participation in war was thrilling.

By the middle of the 1950s, the frenzied hollering of the Dravidianists whose venomous Tamil chauvinism had penetrated almost every corner of the Tamil society was about to reach the climax they desired. They were now within striking distance of capturing political power which alone would enable them to seize and bamboozle institutions with the Dravidian battering ram. To the hypocritical sensibilities of the supremely overrated film director Maniratnam, this bamboozling appeared as some sort of Divine Dravidian Deliverance of Tamil Nadu as depicted in his *Iruvar,* a dishonest movie.

The atmosphere of social harmony that had existed among the B.A. and M.A. students at Presidency College, Madras till the late 1940s (as described by Dr. B.G.L. Swamy inthe previous partof this series) was shattered by a series of venal steps directly aimed at destroying Sanskrit in the garb of making it more accessible to the masses.

This is how it happened.

It began with a self-righteous demand for justice rooted in manufactured victimhood. Overnight, someone noticed that a majority of students graduating with First Class marks belonged only to a “particular forward caste.” This “observation” was followed by this demand: “a scheme should be devised whereby other castes should also be*given*First Class marks.” This topic was hotly debated in the University Senate and Rajya Sabha. The “warrior” Dravidian and “pure” Tamil tabloids witnessed record sales propagandizing this canard. As we’ve seen inthe previousparts, the Dravidian sword-sharpeners won the day on this occasion as well.

A new precedent and rule was established as a result of this propaganda: Henceforth, Sanskrit examiners were to be appointed solely on the basis of their caste. Accordingly, a five-member body of Sanskrit examiners was formed: three Brahmins, two non-Brahmins and one from a really backward caste.

The first three were easy to find. For the second category, an employee of the Indian Railways was discovered after a long search. He had an M.A. in Sanskrit. But finding the other member proved a more uphill task. Several months of hunting yielded no such candidate. Which is when the University made an amendment: only a B.A. in Sanskrit would suffice. Finally, it netted a candidate who frankly confessed his inability: “*Saar*, forget Sanskrit, the last time I even touched a book was twenty-five years ago. I barely crawled through Sanskrit after flunking three times. I’ve forgotten how to write or read the Sanskrit alphabet. I’m doing well in my timber business. Please let me go.” But the Dravidianists were made of steel. After much persuasion, the timber merchant finally consented.

[DONATE TO OUR WORK](https://pages.razorpay.com/DonatetoDD)

Now we arrive at the last category: the solitary Sanskrit examiner from a really backward caste. This search ultimately ended in failure. In all of Tamil Nadu, there was simply no candidate fitting this description.

More debates and discussions ensued among the University luminaries. Finally, it was agreed that the real role of this candidate was to act as a policeman who would ensure that the other four members would not develop casteist feelings in their evaluations. And if they were suspected of such feelings, he would bring in the necessary corrective measures. Who better than a *real policeman* to do the policing? So the Government found a policeman from the Police Department and made him the examiner. No knowledge of Sanskrit was needed for this job.

The cop embraced his new job with the zeal of a new convert. Instead of the time-honoured practice of evaluating answer sheets, he proposed a revolutionary idea: examiners had to know the caste of students in advance and award marks according to the backwardness or otherwise of the students. The other four members were horrified and vetoed his academic revolution. The same fate befell his other revolutionary ideas, the details of which are beyond the scope of this essay.

Finally, after dogged lobbying with Dravidianist politicians, he managed to exert political pressure on the Principal of Presidency College to somehow admit a bunch of unwilling backward caste students to Sanskrit M.A. These students had never learnt Sanskrit since the day they were born. The Sanskrit Pandit of the Department was a traditional Vaidika, deeply learned in *Tarka* (Logic) and *Vyakarana* (Grammar). He asked the cop, “are your students familiar with the Devanagari alphabet?” The cop was dumbfounded. He hadn’t even heard of something called Devanagari. But he had heard of the*Nagaari*(trumpet) typically played in temples on occasions of festivals and processions. So he said, “of course, they play the*Nagaari*with great skill!” The Sanskrit Pandit pitied his own fate but was forced to accept these students. Now the cop issued another demand: the students had to be given special coaching. The Pandit agreed again. But he put a very elementary test to them: pronunciation of the language. As it turned out, the students failed spectacularly. But the policeman had his own brand of reasoning about phonetics: “What do you mean pronunciation? Any word can be pronounced in any manner in any language. Everybody knows this simple fact!” The poor Sanskrit Pandit forced himself to reoncile with his destiny.
