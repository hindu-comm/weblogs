# \[PHOTOESSAY\] A Brief and Tragic History of Mankhas, the Extinct Sanatana Artists

### The story of Mankhas dating back to the Pre-Patanjali era all the way up to their extinction in "independent" India is both ennobling and profoundly tragic.

IN HIS ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE JAIN text, *Uvasagadasao*, the German Indologist Rudolf Hoernle recounts a common sight that he witnessed in his travels in Bengal and Odisha. 

> At the present day, beggars may be found in Bengal who carry pictures > of such deities as Shitala, goddess of small-pox, or Olabibi, goddess > of cholera; in Puri they carry pictures of Jagannatha.

The translation was published in 1890 and Hoernle had clearly spent several years in preparing the book. The simple observation evoked hazy memories of similar scenes that I had witnessed in my own childhood in various parts of rural Karnataka. These occurred in *Jaatres* (fairs, melas) and *Sidi-Utsavas.* Men and women would be squatting down or running behind people, beckoning them to see their picture-scrolls. The scrolls would be neatly bound and folded inside small wooden boxes, and the boxes too, had intricate carvings on them. The picture-scrolls or *Paṭa* typically showed elaborate scenes from various Puranic stories drawn as snug little miniatures encased in panels. Not unlike the comic strips we are all familiar with. Except that these *Paṭa-s* had no text. In a way, these were the mobile equivalents of the renowned *Paṭa-Chitra* in Odisha. And the men and women who displayed them in these fairs would open up the picture-scrolls and narrate the stories in animated detail, infusing impressive dramatic skills in their narration. They didn’t charge a fixed fee. I recall paying 50 paisa on one occasion. That was followed by an elaborate blessing in rustic poetry…invoking Shiva or Devi. 

Little did I know back then that these people were professionals and the fact that they had a name, and that their profession was indeed *Sanatana*—timeless. They were called *Mankhas.* Both Ananada Coomaraswamy and Dr. V. Raghavan translate *Mankha* as “picture showmen.” They were also known by other names: *Gauriputraka, Kēdāraka, Yamapaṭaka, aṇḍ Pratimādharin*.

For countless centuries, Mankhas were a ubiquitous presence not just in India but abroad as well. What began as a practice and profession of exhibiting scroll-pictures and paintings depicting different Puranic themes eventually became an invaluable cultural treasure. Travellers from various countries were so awestruck and inspired by it that they spun off variations to suit their own cultures. Over time, this art form journey all the way to China and Brihad-Bharata. For example, as recent as 1416, the Chinese work, *Ying-yai Sheng-lan* records this scene in Java:

> There is a sort of men who paint on paper men, birds, animals, insects > and so on: the paper is like a scroll and is fixed between two wooden > rollers three feet high; at one side these rollers are level with the > paper, whilst they protrude at the other side. The man squats down on > the ground and places the picture before him, unrolling one part after > the other and turning it towards the spectators, whilst in the native > language and in a loud voice he gives an explanation of every part: > the spectators sit around him and listen, laughing or crying according > to what he tells them.

The Bali variant of the *Mankha* art form is known as *Wayang Beber.* It was classified as a dramatic art. The artist who performs it is known as the Dalang. He unfurls several sheets of cloth containing paintings of scenes of stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Each cloth is unrolled one by one, i.e., scene by scene and the Dalang narrates the scenes using dialogue. Like so many such ancient art forms, Wayang Beber is also on the verge of extinction.

The art form was also popular in Persia. The [meaning](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=795) of the Persian word, *ṣūrat-ḵẖẉān* is highly revealing: “One who pictures the state of angels and men as to reward and punishment on the day of resurrection, and receives a remuneration for it from the bystanders.” This scene or painting is a direct lift from the *Yamapaṭas*, which were wildly popular in India for several centuries as we shall see.

A *Yamapata*

INTERESTINGLY, THE WORD *ṣūrat* also means a puppet in Persian popular theatre, and *ḵẖẉān* is the reciter or singer of the story performed by the puppets. Even more incredibly, the *ḵẖẉān* begins the performance with an invocatory verse of an Islamic song known as the *rāk-ī-hindi*. The word, *rāk* is a corruption of the Sanskrit word, *rāga.* Thus, *rāk-ī-hindi* means “Indian tune or song.” And both the manner and modalities used in enacting this art form was almost wholly imported from classical Sanskrit theatre complete with the *Nāndi* invocation at the beginning up to the *Mangala* in the end. 

The *Mankha* tradition survived almost intact even during the British colonisation of India. John Lockwood Kipling, father of the arch racist Rudyard Kipling, describes his experience of watching the *Mankhas* in action in his travelogue, *Beast and Man in India.*

> One of the most popular of the pictures sold at fairs is a composition > known as Dharmraj, a name of Yama, the Hindu Pluto, and also used > broadly for Justice. The Judge is enthroned and demon executioners > bring the dead to receive their doom. The river of death flows on one > side of the picture and those go safely across who hold a cow by the > tail, while others are torn by terrible fishes. Chitrgupt, the clerk > or recording angel of Yama, considered to be the ancestor of the > Kayasth or clerkly caste, sits in an office with account books exactly > like those of a Hindu tradesman, and according to the record of each > soul, punishments or rewards are given. For, as a popular native > saying has it,— "God looks out of the window of heaven and keeps > account." *Duts* or executioners torture offenders, while the blest > sail upwards in air-borne chariots.

Kipling wrote his book in 1891. See how neatly this corresponds with Rudolf Hoernle’s observation in 1890? Kipling was a teacher and traveller and documenter of foreign societies while Hornle was an Indologist. Both witnessed the same India around the same period.

A Sketch from Kipling’s Book

WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT TODAY, consternation and melancholy strikes us. The criminally nonchalant manner in which we have squandered away Bharatavarsha’s profound cultural stamp that had exercised such invisible suzerainty throughout a vast region in Asia. That the squandering happened *after* “independence” magnifies the extent and scale of the crime. For example, Walang Beber is an endangered art form in Indonesia because *Mankhas* have become extinct in the very cradle they were birthed in: Bharata. Exactly how many sins against the Hindu cultural heritage should Nawab Nehru account for? The legendary DVG castigates this Nehruvian felony in memorable language:

> Flirting with Russia and dreading China, India's relations with > America are ambiguous; and she must seem all things to all men and > nothing in particular to any one, which is her non-alignment! And what > gives poignancy to the reflection that WE ARE SO MISERABLY INCAPABLE > OF GOING AT LEAST TO THE MORAL SUPPORT OF CAMBODIA IS THE RECOLLECTION > OF THE HISTORICAL FACT OF OUR ANCIENT KINSHIP. ONCE UPON A TIME > PERHAPS ABOUT THE TIME OF THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA – > CAMBODIA WAS PART OF THE CULTURAL EMPIRE OF HINDUISM.

This is the proven fact of history: as long as the tempering, soothing and motherly palm of Sanatana culture exercised its silent influence on alien cultures, they remained largely sober. Despite successive Islamic invasions in many parts of South East Asia, the intrinsic Sanatana clime remained unchanged. Even a Persia which had been wholly Islamised centuries ago, continued to draw inspiration from our culture and art forms. But the day India opted for the unwritten Quran of Nawab Nehru known as secularism, the whole thing not only imploded but became irretrievable.

And on this pessimistic note, we shall explore the brief history of the lost cultural treasure called the *Mankhas.*

Painting from the Nayaka Era")

A Painting of the Nayaka Era in South India

THE EARLIEST MENTION OF MANKHAS occurs in Patanjali’s *Mahabhasya* mentioning the display of paintings (*citra*) depicting Krishna slaying Kamsa. The literal rendering of the text is this: “How in respect of the paintings? In the pictures, men see the blows rained down on Kamsa, and how he is dragged about.”

The clear inference is that the tradition of displaying these paintings in public such as in exhibitions, fairs, etc., was already in vogue during Patanjali’s era, and *Mankhas* or picture showmen was already a recognised profession.

Jaina Prakrt texts unambiguously define the term *Mankha* as a professional picture showman and he is clubbed in the class of entertainers such as actors, dancers, story-tellers, etc. The *Bhagavati Sutra* mentions the name of Gosala Mankhaliputta (also known as Maskari Gosala, Makkhali Gosala). The Mankhaliputta refers to profession of Gosala’s father, who was a *Mankha.* A Sanskrit gloss describes *Mankhas* as *citraphalakavyagrakara-bhiksu-visesa* meaning, a *Bhikshu* or mendicant who takes alms by exhibiting pictures of deities which he carries with him. In general, there are copious Jain texts mentioning and even extolling talented *Mankhas*.

Long story short, by the post Gupta era, picture exhibitions as an art form was flourishing and it would retain the position until the British colonial period. Its evolution is actually a thrilling story. From exhibiting and narrating picture-scrolls showing Kamsa’s pummelling at Krishna’s hands, the focus shifted almost exclusively to something known as the *Yamapattaka* or *Yamapata.* The *Yamapata* showed picture-scrolls representing virtuous and evil deeds and the reward and punishment arising therefrom in *Yamapuri*, the abode of Yama.  

Major Sanskrit literary works mention *Yamapattakas* or picture showmen who painted *Yamapatas.* 

In Vishakadatta’s renowned play *Mudrarakshasa,* dateable between the 5th and 9th century CE, Kautilya’s spy, Nipunaka disguises himself as a picture showman. He says that men earn their living by means of the same Yama who kills people. Then he enters Chandanadasa’s home, carrying a scroll with figures of Yama upon it. But before he enters, this is the dialogue he utters: “I will enter here, show my pictures and chant my song (*yamapatam* *darshayan gitaani gayami*).” After his errand is over, he brings its report to Chanakya saying in Prakrt, “Spreading out the Yama picture scroll, I commenced my song. (*jamapadam pasariya pauttohmi gidaim gaidyum*).”

Painting of Mudrarakshasa

BANABHATTA’s *Harshacharita* paints a descriptive picture of picture showmen: “Like those who depict *Naraka*, loud singers paint unrealities on the canvas of the air…In the market street amid a great crowd of inquisitive children, he observed a *Yamapattaka* in whose left hand was a painted canvas stretched out on a support of upright rods and showing the God of Death mounted on his dreadful buffalo.Wielding a reed wand in his other hand, he was expounding the features of the next world, and could be heard to chant the following verses…” (Verses clipped for this essay)

The prolific translator of Sanskrit literary works, M.R. Kale, in his notes on the *Mudrarakshasa* says this: “The exhibition of Yamapata was one of the sources of making money.” Likewise, K.T. Telang’s edition of the same play says this about *Yamapata:* “a series of representations of the exploits of Yama, something like the boxes of sacred pictures which are shown about to this day.” And Telang too, gives a reference to the aforementioned passage in *Harshacharita.*

Writing in the *History and Culture of the Indian People,* N.R. Ray, gives us a pretty brilliant description of the *Yamapata* and its various offshoots: “*Yamapatas* were executed on textile scrolls and dealt with themes of a narrative-didactic nature, showing the results of Karma in the other world. Buddhaghosha, the celebrated Buddhist scholar…refers to a similar kind of painting to which he gives the name of *charanachitras* which consisted of scenes of happy and unhappy destinies of men after death with appropriate labels attached to them and shown in portable galleries. There can be no doubt that these *yamapatas* or *charanachitras* are the ancestors, in form, meaning and presentation, of the *patachitras* that are widely current in Eastern India…” As we mentioned in the previous episode of this series, like all else in the Hindu cultural life, this tradition of a sub-genre of art too, shows our unbroken continuity. N.R. Ray concludes his assessment on a sombre but profound note: “**No contemporary example of** ***Yamapata*** **or** ***charanachitra*****…has survived to this day**; but it was evidently a folk-art of ethnic and religious significance and of wide popular appeal, **an itinerant school of deep and great educative value for the rural masses**.” (Emphasis added)

The prolific and comprehensive scholar of Indian art and culture, Stella Kramrisch wields her pen like a brush: “As permanent or temporary decoration, on the floors, on the walls and ceilings of private houses, palaces and temples, and in the streets, paintings instructed and enlivened the mind of the public. Even religious teachers used painting as the most popular means of communication, that could be understood by the illiterate and the child. ‘There is a class of Brahmanical teachers, known by the name of Mankha. They make a (portable) framework upon which they cause to be drawn) a variety of pictures, depicting scenes of good and evil destinies, of fortunes and misfortunes, and causing the labels to be inscribed: 'By doing this deed one attains this,' 'By doing that, one attains that. Thus, showing different destinies, they wander about with these pictures.’”

Scroll painting showing scenes from the Ramayana

IN THE VIJAYANAGARA ERA, picture showmen, quite obviously received a huge fillip. In a short but valuable study of Vijayanagara paintings, C. Sivamurti gives us impressive details of how *chitrapatas* had evolved during that period. While *Yamapatas* retained their prominence, their model branched out in various forms. Jain *chitrapatas* for instance, played an influential role and perhaps for the first time, elaborate labels were inscribed under each scene. Some examples include the life of Rishabhadeva, birth and life of Vardhamana Mahavira, etc. The Hindu side displayed paintings of Yudhishtira’s coronation, the love between Radha and Krishna, *Amritamanthana,* etc. We see a feeble continuation of the same tradition even today in most temples in South India. The walls of these temples show an elaborate and scene-by-scene depiction of say, the *Sthala-Purana,* the various *Mahimas* of the presiding deity, and other stories.

Following the tragic implosion of the Vijayanagara Empire, the *Mankhas* preserved their art under the patronage of the Nayakas in South India. Thanjavur, Madurai, Kadapa, and Mysore among others sustained and embellished it. In other parts of Bharatavarsha as well, *Mankhas* somehow managed to survive, painfully wheezing out their last breaths in say Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar, Bengal and Odisha.

And what Rudyard Kipling’s father saw and documented in 1890 was an art form that was in its death throes, impelled by the plunder-hungry marauders of his own native England. Once the pride of the Sanatana society, *Mankhas,* like the *Vipra-Vinodins* and *Bhattarakas* were hurtling towards extinction.

And when I encountered them in my childhood, they were standing on the verge of beggary but their generational reverence for our deities and our sacred stories, and the memory of the profoundly devout manner in which they narrated their picture-stories wells up my eyes. Even as I conclude this.

They themselves weren’t aware of their preeminence as the exalted inheritors of a hoary cultural treasure. That perhaps is the greater tragedy.
