## Editor’s Note

In this episode, Amatya Ramachandra Pant provides a semi-detailed backgrounder which led to the composition of the brilliant *Ajnapatra.* The portions excerpted from it stand the test of time and our administrators, political theorists, academicians and even a general audience will undoubtedly derive immense benefit from reading it. It is perfectly consonant with the Sanatana method in which theory is not divorced from practice.

Written in an intimate, refined and soothing tenor, the learned Amatya addresses the document to his ruler Sambhaji II.

Read on!

## The Need of enunciating Principles of State Policy

Your esteemed Majesty increased the prosperity of the kingdom, the administration of which was entrusted to you. You understand political affairs, policy and laws well. However in order that princes of long life who are the very ornaments to the kingdom should be well-versed in political affairs and that other governors and criminal officers in various parts of the country should protect the state by conducting themselves according to principles of good governance, this treatise on the principles of state policy in the form of this Royal Edict (*Ajnapatra*) in accordance with the *Sastras*.

The ruler should follow that Dharma which is traditionally the best and which his ancestors had followed, and should perform deeds by which fame is acquired.

*He should have great fear of bad reputation in all undertakings.*

Kings who lived in the past succeeded in this world and acquired the next with the help of Dharma. Believing with a firm confidence that the practice of Dharma, the worship of Bhagavan, the acquisition of the favour of saintly persons, the attainment of the welfare of all, and the prosperity of the kingdom should be uninterrupted and regulated, the king should settle grants according to their special *Punya* on temples of Devatas, places of pilgrimage, holy centres of Santana Dharma, hermitages of saints and places so that the daily ablution of water, worship, offerings, annual pilgrimages and great festivals may be well performed. The King should continue these traditions uninterruptedly by making frequently inquiries with kindness.
