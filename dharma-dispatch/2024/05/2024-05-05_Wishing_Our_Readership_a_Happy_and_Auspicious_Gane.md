THE DHARMA DISPATCH DIGEST WISHES all our readers a very happy and auspicious Ganesha Chaturthi. May Ganesha remove all your obstacles, fill your lives with light and lead you all to greater success and fulfilment.

This great festival is also an occasion for us to reaffirm The Dharma Dispatch Digestâ€™s commitment to offer rare, valuable, and original content enabling us to craft and promote a cultural narrative rooted in the Sanatana Ethos.

Likewise, we express our heartfelt gratitude to all our readers and subscribers for staying with us in this sacred, civilisational journey. Your support makes our work possible.

Jai Sri Ganesha!
