# Behind the Manipulation of Tech Giants Lies the Asuric Western Mindset - Part 2: The Sanatana Perspective

### Here is an analysis from the Sanatana perspective of the Western-dominated global order that has held sway for more than two centuries.

IF WE WERE TO ANALYSE this from the Sanatana perspective, we get the following: the West’s awakening from its Tamasic slumber catapulted it directly into belligerent Rajas unrestrained by the tempering force of Sattva. The Sanatana temperament calls this rapacious and innately barbaric behavior as Asura Guna or demonic trait. This is also the fundamental difference between Sanatana Dharma and the West, no matter how it describes itself—as scientific, rational, etc. The Sanatana ethos elevates and universalizes the particular whereas the Asuric west does the exact opposite – i.e., it divorces the wholesomeness of Life itself into mutually irreconcilable components which must by definition be at war with one another. Thus, all of post-Renaissance Western “philosophy” is just a lava-laden Vesuvius of warring intellectual acrobatics whereas all of our Upanishadic Rishis have the vision of the same Himalayan Darshana albeit seen through their own eyes.

This fundamental Sanatana-philosophical grounding is essential to understand the ongoing quasi-dictatorial behavior of technology giants that are wreaking such havoc upon entire nations, especially India. This behavior is just the latest manifestation of the same Asuric trait ingrained in the Western psyche as we have seen so far. Unless we understand this phenomenon on this plane, we can only grasp at superficial straws at the behavior of Twitter, YouTube, etc. Whether the Far Left, Woke, etc have taken over these companies is really incidental as far as the Sanatana civilization is concerned. Our spiritual civilization is their common enemy, marked out for annihilation centuries ago. Let’s assume that a Pat Robertson completely takes over these tech platforms by destroying the Woke Left. What are your bets how he’ll behave with us heathens?

Think about recent history.

Even as India was groping its way after gaining political freedom, think about the ways in which the West sought to beat us down and keep us down. One of the most effective ways was to create and maintain monopolies in every conceivable area of human activity: technology, healthcare, food supply, even milk. The more insidious method of justifying these monopolies was to invent that vicious term, “third-world country,” and then claim that these monopolies were actually meant for the benefit of the “third-world” countries who didn’t know how to take care of themselves. All of this passed off as “studies,” which were highly acclaimed by say, the United Nations.

But then, this was nothing new as well. It was merely an upgradation of the earlier technique. Let’s look at some more parallels from history to illustrate this.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ef87ab6-44c4-4ea4-9ab5-c987033f28c6_640x490.jpeg)

</div>

IN THE COLONIAL ERA, we have the profoundly tragic figure of the great patriot, V.O. Chidambaram Pillai. With practiced ruthlessness, the British ganged up against him and exterminated his flourishing shipping business because he had dared to openly challenge their monopoly. Which is the other thing at play here: the economic edifice of British colonialism was built on building such monopolies and squeezing the host country, which in the first place, allowed them the space and resources to build these monopolies.

Which is pretty much what tech giants have done today. Do a back-of-the-envelope calculation: list the ten biggest Western-owned corporations in any domain or subdomain of technology and verify for yourself that they are all monopolies or near-monopolies. In other words, we have already reached a stage where vast swathes of our population are beholden to these alien monopolies even to meet their daily needs. Now, substitute “daily needs” with survival. You get the picture.

I will hazard a conjecture and I don’t mind being wrong. One reason why there has been no third world war so far is because the West saw what the atom bomb did to Japan. However, the other side of this coin shows that nothing has stopped the West’s 500-year-old train of unleashing unprovoked global violence. Post-World War II, the West, especially America, began hitting defenceless targets in small pockets in Asia and larger pockets in Africa with frequent impunity and has invariably emerged unpunished. Even if we set this aside, ask a simple question: which sane democracy will support a Jihadi despotism like Pakistan against a spiritual civilization like India? Even here, we see another historical parallel: Pakistan is an artificial state dedicated to fanaticism. It was created by the old barbarism of Europe painted with the glimmering varnish of science and etiquette. But it was nurtured with the breastmilk of the new barbarism of the post-colonial era.

## Capacity for Organised Violence

<div id="§capacity-for-organised-violence" class="header-anchor-widget offset-top">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">

<div class="header-anchor-widget-button" href="https://thedharmadispatch.substack.com/i/145949319/capacity-for-organised-violence">

</div>

</div>

</div>

All of this boils down to the same underlying Asuric phenomenon: the capacity of the West to inflict organized violence on a global scale is unparalleled and they continue to do it with zero qualms to their conscience. One is reminded of the iconic Dharampal’s words in this context.

> There is a fundamental difference between the educated and scholarly > class of India and its Western counterpart. **This class of India is > not endowed with heartlessness**…However, this class of Westerners > doesn't shy away from inflicting violence. **Even after killing crores of his own people, Stalin remained akin to a Sthitaprajna, equanimous. What Stalin committed in Russia was as well committed anywhere in Europe with equal ease.**

To put this in another fashion, there is no justification that cannot be invented to soothe away any such qualms of conscience. In the colonial era, this justification of the West’s enjoyment of the fruits of its brazen, genocidal violence included hypocrisies like “civilizing mission,” and “white man’s burden.” Today, it is “bringing democracy,” as if context-free and culture-free democracy is a universal good which is universally valid.
