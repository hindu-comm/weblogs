VLADIMIR PUTIN’S SLEDGEHAMMER SPEECH on October 21 at the Valdai International Discussion Club was understandably underreported by the Western, and specially, the American media because it knocked the West where it hurts the most: the solar plexus of the woke world. In fact, it was a frontal charge against the ever-expanding gamut of Woke insanity including but not limited to gender fluidity, reverse racism, erasing history, elimination of traditional values, and the destruction of the family unit.

It is also a bit tragic that Putin’s purposeful [speech](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66975) did not receive the attention it really deserves in India. In fact, his speech is also a dauntless declaration of his intent to protect Russia from the cancel culture of the West. As far as India is concerned, it is a tremendous opportunity to begin to carve for itself and retake its historical mantle as a global leader in all that is culturally virtuous, noble, wise, and refined. Or as they say in some circles, the position of that ill-defined term, *Vishwaguru.* That pedestal will and must be raised on the rebuilt foundations of the historical Sanatana civilizational superstructure.
