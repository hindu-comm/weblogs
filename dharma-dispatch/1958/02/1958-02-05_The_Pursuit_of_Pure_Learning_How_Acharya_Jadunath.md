## **Editor’s Note**

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME delightful and inspirational excerpts from Acharya Jadunath Sarkar’s personal reminiscences on how he built up his personal library. Calling it a “personal library” is an understatement of epic proportions. In reality, his library arguably rivalled that of full-fledged universities and professional libraries. But we are getting ahead of ourselves.

Do the full piece! The original is titled *How My Library Grew Up,* published in 1958, a few months before the Acharya passed away and joined the ranks of the immortals.

## **How My Library Grew Up**

WHEN I WAS A SCHOOLBOY in the 5th class (now called the Seventh Standard), we had to read a little Greek history. Our text-book was a charmingly written American work, Peter Parley’s *Universal History*, as simple and pleasant as Little Arthur’s *History of England*. The style and the stories lured us to read it through, and we had to give our answers in Bengali, so that we understood the contents. In the next higher class we read the chapters on Roman history from the same volume. Thus I came to know of the battles of Epaminondas and Alexander, Hannibal and Cesar.

How I longed to visualise those battles! Just then came my opportunity. In the days before the Suez Canal, the British officers who came to serve in India, often passed fifteen or even twenty years here before taking furlough home. Most of them, therefore, brought with themselves a collection of good books to beguile the time during their Indian exile. Wellington, when he came to India as a Colonel (1798) brought a fairly large library in his ship. So also did Elphinstone and others.

At the time of their retirement they used to sell their furniture and libraries, and the Indian grandees of their last stations used to buy them, My father as a zamindar in Rajshahi (North Bengal) used to buy the books of the retiring Magistrates and Judges of that district. His passion was for History,—fiction and poetry being his aversion. I found among his books a copy of the *History of the Art of War*, by Baron de Jomini (a former General of Napoleon), which was a standard text-book in the military colleges of England.

Here were the battles of Epaminondas illustrated by plans I could now visualise this antique hero’s famous oblique attack and marching en echelon, or Hannibal’s encircling tactics at Canne. In the Fourth Class, geometry was introduced into our course, and I began to draw oblongs and semi-circles to illustrate the military movements I had read of in dear old Peter Parley. Thus the microbe of military historiography entered into my brain and I was doomed to become a military bore (civil division) when I grew up.

Then, after passing the Matric examination (in 1887) I first read Tennyson’s Ode on the Burial of the Duke of Wellington, where I came upon this passage:

“*This is he that far away*

*Against the myriads of Assaye*

*Clash’d with his fiery few and won*.”

Ever since then I have been intrigued by the question—How did it happen that a fiery few could defeat myriads who were not cowards or weaklings, when both sides fought with fire- arms?

From that time it became my passion to buy rare books on Indian history,—at first those written in English and relating to the British period only. My educational expenses were paid by my father and I was free to spend all my own money from the first grade scholarships which I enjoyed throughout my college life, on these “India books.” The second-hand book-sellers of Calcutta found in me their most liberal (and gullible) patron, and thus the rare books on indian history discarded by the European clubs, barracks and private owners (like Prince Ghulam Husain, the last, grandson of Tipu Sultan, who died in Calcutta) were first offered to me.

I thus laid the foundation of my historical library, but when I passed the Premchand Examination (1897) and undertook orignal research, my library grew and branched like the proverbial banyan tree. I discarded my Calcutta suppliers and began to give large orders, year after year, to the famous second-hand book sellers of England,—Luzac and Trubner, Francis Edwards and Blackwell. George’s Sons of Bristo were my first and most copious agent in England (from 1898 onwards). After thirty years this stream stopped through fullness of collection and also the demands of my new love,—original research with the help of Persian, Marathi and English MSS. and records. The saturation point in printed English books had now ben reached.

MY FIRST “BAPTISM OF INK” in the field of Indian history was a study of the Fall of Tipu Sultan which I printed in my College Magazine just after graduation (1891). It was based entirely on English books and despatches, all available in print. But after 1897 when I set myself to making truly original researches in Indo-Muslim history, I devoted my resources mainly to acquiring Persian, Marathi and French manuscripts and printed volumes of State- papers (despatches).

The result is that today my collection of Persian manuscripts and Marathi printed sources is indispensable to the students of our mediaeval history, as it has brought together in one place the necessary works which are scattered in many towns of India and the famous public libraries of Europe — India Office, British Museum, the Bodleian, the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris, and the then Royal Library of Berlin, besides Kazvini’s metrical history of Nadir Shah of which there is only one manuscript in the world, in Leningrad. Of these last I have secured photographs.

In India, the Rampur (Rohilkhand), Hyderabad and Khuda Bakhsh (Patna) Libraries have been thoroughly ransacked by me after repeated visits. From the first I equipped myself with the very necessary Survey of India maps regardless of cost — the old India Atlas sheets on a scale of four miles to the inch, and in the case of certain battlefields and cities on a still more detailed scale, one mile to the inch or even three inches,—such as Lalsot, Talikota, Delhi, etc. This old series has now been discarded by the Survey Department and replaced by the Degree Sheéts (or still more recent international scale), but the oldest scientifically drawn map of British India is of priceless worth to me, as it gives the result of the survey before the Sepoy Mutiny and the Railways changed the face of India; the historic but now discarded routes and village names are to be found here only.

At first I approached military history as a lover of romance. I then belonged to the “drum and trumpet school” of history. My favourite collections in the earlier years related to the Sikh, Nepal, Anglo-Maratha and Burmese wars. Soon after, I took to the Sepoy Mutiny with such zeal that I ended by collecting over 150 volumes on this branch — or 200 if we include the memoirs of every British officer who took the least part in even one of its campaigns. Naturally, post-Mutiny British-Indian history is poorly represented here, except for the Afghan wars.

In European history, my love of the picturesque drove me to the French Revolution and Napoleonic periods. I bought every book on the Peninsular War and Waterloo that came within my reach, and the memoirs of the statesmen and warriors of that period (available in English translations), including even the gossip of Napoleon’s valet (in three volumes!). They read like romances of absorbing interest.

It was only late in my literary career that I turned from the romance of war to its technical or educative side. I set myself to exploring the old strategy and tactics of battles fought in India, so long as there was an Indian State to oppose the foreigners. This limited my range to Alexander as the upper time-limit and Wellington as the lower, 323 B.C. — 1803 A.D. Because of these wars only we possess accurate descriptions.

But if I am to correctly assess the tactics and strategy of the mediaeval Indian wars, and deduce the lessons that they can teach to a modern soldier, I must first equip myself with a knowledge of the evolution of the art of war in Europe, its modern technicalities and practical illustrations (on which subjects the books relating exclusively to Indian history are silent). Those who attempt to study the Indian wars of historic times without such a background of European military history, will only plough the sand, they cannot reach the base- rock of reality. A comic example has been supplied by a Bengali graduate whose doctorate thesis has come under my eyes, and who proves that there was a Red Cross in ancient India, because the Hindu kings went to battle followed by cooks, physicians and coolies who used to take care of their wounded!

I digested Oman’s *History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages*, Denison’s *History of Cavalry,* Lloyd’s *History of Infantry*, Cole and Priestly’s *Outlines of British Military History*, and the works of Liddell Hart and Cyril Falls, General Fuller and Evelyn Wood.

MY LAST WORK, the *Military History of India*, began publication serially, but fitfully in the *Hindusthan Standard* newspaper, Sunday issues, in 1952. Several of the battles had been written earlier for my other works, such as *Aurangzib* (5 Vols.), *Shivaji* and *The Fall of the Mughal Empire* (4 Vols.), but they were now collected together in one place and edited for integration in this new body. Ten chapters more will bring this book to its end (1803).

There is no end to this quest, this search for buried truth, which we call research. Even now fresh reflections and newly-discovered materials have forced on me a revision of my earlier descriptions and opinions. One example is the Battle of Assaye, where my first account (printed in my *Fall*, Vol. IV in 1950) and based on Wellington’s despatches, has been entirely recast and made credible, by an intensive study (and reading between the lines) of the Regi- mental records of the 78th Highlanders who bore the brunt of that battle, (quoted in Mac-veigh’s *Historical Records of the 78th Highlanders*). Truly has the ancient Sanskrit poet said: “*Time has no end and the world is vast.”*
