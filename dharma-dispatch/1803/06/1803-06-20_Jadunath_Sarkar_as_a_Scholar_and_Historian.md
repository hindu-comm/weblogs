ALL OF JADUNATH’S LATER LITERARY performance is the legitimate and logical expansion of the Premchand Roychand thesis on *India of Aurangzib: Its Statistics, Topography and Roads* (1901). From this slender start, his genius like the mighty Ganges furrowed through the vast expanse of the history of the Mughal Empire to its historic end in the year 1803.

*But the Mughal Empire has proved too small to contain all the energy and learning of Jadunath*. The dry bed of the history of Medieval Bengal as well as the tumultuous mountain stream of Maratha history, has been equally benefited by the outflow of Jadunath’s genius as a historian. As a soldier fighting the battle of life, age seems to have as little effect on his energy and optimism. His very constitution demands work, more work, though not even his enemies would say that he ever cared for fame and popularity or for making piles of money as an author.

Jadunath remarks very often that what taxes his brain most are style and presentation, in which he has attained perfection almost by assiduous efforts added to his natural gifts for observation and narration. He is never tired of writing, revising, re-writing until in the end he produces a polished composition with a striking effect always edifying and expressive of life.

In all his writings one easily notices his own mark of originality and extensive reading. He often refreshes the subject by adding apt quotations and appropriate illustrations from world history and literature.
