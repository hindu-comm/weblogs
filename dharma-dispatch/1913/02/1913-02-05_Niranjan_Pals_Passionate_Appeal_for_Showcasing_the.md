## Introduction

THE STORY OF THE INDIAN FREEDOM STRUGGLE is as vast, diverse, widespread and chequered as this scared land itself. Or to invoke K.M. Munshi’s durable dictum, the story is the story of our own people. Both stalwarts and forgotten heroes working in every realm of our national life had internalized this *bhava* while working in their chosen fields: will my work contribute meaningfully and constructively to my country? Will it uphold the glory of this great civilization? Will it show Bharatavarsha as a cultural beacon endowed with the light that guides the world? Concatenate with these questions was its opposite strain: what is the best way to clear the polluted fog of mischievous canards spread by the British—or Europeans in general—about our civilization, culture, traditions, customs, manners and above all, our society?

To this class belongs Niranjan Pal, one of the founding fathers of Indian cinema. Assessing the real value of his contribution is not the subject of this essay. The intrinsic nature and the passion that informed his contribution is.

NIRANJAN PAL WAS the energetic son of his more illustrious father, the great freedom fighter, an architect of the Swadeshi Movement, and *Purna Swaraj,* Bipan Chandra Pal. The Brobdingnagian personality of his revolutionary father, the vibrant cultural atmosphere at home and the turbulent climate of the Bengal of his childhood left a lasting impact on Niranjan. The icing on the cake was the kind of luminaries that his father was close to: Balgangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Aurobindo Ghosh among others. As a teenager, Niranjan himself plunged head-on into the freedom struggle. He carried this struggle from London where lived as a student. Here, he came in contact with two extraordinary heroes: the intrepid Madanlal Dhingra and that lion, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.

Happy reading!

## Cinematography and its Prospects

I wonder if the Indian public have an adequate idea of the possibilities of cinematography, both as an educational medium and as a commercial venture. This new industry is still in its infancy, and its field is still unexplored. The future possibilities of Cinematography as a business concern have not yet been fully realised even in England, and the only country that has foreseen its commercial anti educational value is America.

It is not so much a matter of money, as the estimate given below will show. It is rather a question of enterprise and organisation. I say this because I have so little faith in the great financiers of our country, and I believe *there is hardly a single instance where they have not come too late into the field to make any successful attempt to prevent foreign capitalists from exploiting India*.

There is a very good opening for Indian films. The cinema-patrons always want to see something new and exciting, and the Red Indian and Wild-West pictures that were once the rage have now diminished in popularity. The photo-play producers are now looking for new materials in India and the East. This is the time for enterprising capitalists in our country to take the business in hand.

Apart from all commercialism in the Cinema trade, one great thing can be achieved for the good of India: *this is to present her before the world as she really is—her culture and her people in their daily life.* It will certainly serve to change the idea many foreigners have that Indians are a kind of semi-civilized people and have hideous manners.
