### Preface

THE LIST OF MY GROWING DEBTS to Shatavadhani Dr. Ganesh has newly expanded after he sent me a delightful video of a elevating [lecture by Sriram V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCXWSr5clk8) titled *Some Lawyers of Madras and their Cultural Influence.* If our alleged education system had any modicum of fundamental sense, such lectures would have been printed out and made prescribed reading for high school students.

Among the legal and judicial luminaries that Mr. Sriram mentions in the lecture, the name of Subbier Subramania Iyer (popularly, Sir S. Subramania Iyer) caught my attention for a rather fond evocation: a profile that DVG has written about this stalwart. It is perhaps the best-ever profile of Subramania Iyer written in English. It is actually a fragrant garland of offering that DVG has placed at the feet of Sri Subramania Iyer.

About half a century separated Sri Subramania Iyer and D.V. Gundappa. In one sense, DVG was both the beneficiary and indirect disciple of Sri Subramania Iyer. Thus, when he wrote Sri Iyer’s biographical sketch on June 7, 1918, DVG was in a way offering a heartfelt Guru-Dakshina of sorts, spread over thirty-four ennobling pages. Sri Subramania Iyer had ripened into seventy-six years, living almost like a Sanyasi.

DVG wrote in his manifold capacity as a man of public eminence, a magazine editor, a freedom fighter, a statesman, a legislator, and a junior contemporary of Sri Iyer. These combined roles embodied in DVG gave him the kind of authority that later generations of biographers cannot naturally possess.

At this distance in time and thanks once again to an “education system” that has bred ingratitude for our past savants—even of recent vintage—Sri Subramania Iyer’s name does not even occur as a footnote in our national memory. But well into the first decade of “independence,” his name figured prominently and variously as the Father of the Home Rule Movement, which he founded along with Annie Beasant. His role in and the successes that the Home Rule Movement notched up back then was the truly stuff of legends. Sri Iyer also counts as one of the seminal builders who transformed Madras into a thriving commercial, political and cultural nub during the 1860-1960 century. His substantial home was home to culture, music, learning, scholarship, and publication. Above all, he earned a permanent abode of distinction and reverence in the Hindu Heart of that period for his unstinted service of devotion to Dharma via two great institutions he founded and nurtured: the *Dharma Rakshana Sabha* and the *Shuddha Dharma Mandala.*

I’ve already given away enough.

Without further ado, I consider it my pride and bounden duty to offer this first episode of a series containing excerpts drawn from DVG’s profile of Sri S. Subramania Iyer titled *Sri Subramania Iyer: Biographical Introduction.* Some stylistic changes have been made but the original text has not been altered in any fashion.
