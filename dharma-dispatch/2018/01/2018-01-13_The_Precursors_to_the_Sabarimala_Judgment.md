# The Precursors to the Sabarimala Judgment

### The controversial SC judgement on Sabarimala in 2018 did not happen by accident. In a way, it was a culmination of several precursors put in motion decades ago.

THE SABARIMALA VERDICT of 2018 is the cumulative outcome of sustained backroom manoeuvring and pressure tactics by a vast and determined and well-funded and well-networked lobby of breaking India forces. But that is not just all. This verdict also has several similar precedents and precursors each of which met with success. We can examine just two representative samples.

On February 12, 2017, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, in a laudable move,[passed](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/Karnataka-amends-law-to-allow-kambala/article17296265.ece)the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Karnataka Amendment) Bill, 2017, exempting **Kambala** and bullock-cart racing from the purview of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960. This comes close on the heels of the Tamil Nadu government’s[ordinance](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-gives-nod-to-tamil-nadus-jallikattu-ordinance/articleshow/56696136.cms)allowing **Jallikattu**, okayed by the Centre in January 2017.

When we consider the timeline of the events that resulted in the Supreme Court’s ban of Jallikattu and Kambala, what is clearly evident is this: until PETA (and similar organisations) came along, there was really no problem with regard to Jallikattu, Kambala etc.

By its[own admission](http://www.petaindia.com/about-peta/history/)on its website, PETA opened shop in India in 2000. So it’s really astonishing that 14 years of incessant and loud activism and campaigning got it the Supreme Court’s attention and the consequent ban in May 2014.

But **what has actually occurred as a social and cultural phenomenon is the fact that a new fault line has been created in an erstwhile harmonious society.**

At the risk of oversimplifying, this fault line can be defined as a clash between animal activists/sympathisers and those organising, participating, and patronising events like Kambala, etc. At one level, this phenomenon can also be regarded as a clash between the “urban” and the “rural.” But the biggest *civilisational*warning that emerged is the ban itself: in other words, the Jallikattu and Kambala prohibitions shows the precise extent to which the “native” Indian society has been deracinated and made rootless at the very top echelons.
