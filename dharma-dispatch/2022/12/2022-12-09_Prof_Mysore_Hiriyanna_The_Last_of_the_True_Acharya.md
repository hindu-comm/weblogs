THIS ESSAY IS AN EXERCISE in conscious arrogance because it dares to tread in the path enlightened by a galaxy of giants including but not limited to D.V. Gundappa, Dr. V. Raghavan, Prof K. Krishnamurthy, Shri A.R. Krishna Sastri, T.N. Sreekantaiah (Ti.Nam.Sri), and in our own time, Acharya S.R. Ramaswamy and Shatavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh.

On the other hand, this essay is also a modest attempt at a tribute to this great contemporary sage of Indian philosophy out of a feeling of devotion and reverence, emotions which need no qualification.

Arguably, the best profile of Acharya M. Hiriyanna has flowed from the flawless pen of D.V. Gundappa in his *Jnapakachitrashale* volumes. DVG not only had the fortune of personally interacting with Acharya Hiriyanna but in his characteristic fashion, captured the finest, truest and sweetest essence of this scholar-philosopher in the fashion, style and beauty that only he had mastered. And Shatavadhani Dr. Ganesh continued the same legacy in his brilliant and aptly-titled work, *Aardrajyothi* (Soft Luminance), a Kannada biography of Acharya Hiriyanna.

Any mention of Acharya M. Hiriyanna’s glorious legacy will be incomplete and unjust if it examines only some or a few facets. His contribution and bequest is akin to Sanatana Dharma: a unified whole, indivisible and all-encompassing. Acharya Hiriyanna remains one of those rare scholars whose life, work, scholarship and personality are akin to the light reflected by a prism no matter from which perspective you look at it. One perspective is that of the legions of his students who not only trod in his path but reserved nothing but unalloyed reverence towards this great Acharya. Of the countless tributes he earned, here are just two.
