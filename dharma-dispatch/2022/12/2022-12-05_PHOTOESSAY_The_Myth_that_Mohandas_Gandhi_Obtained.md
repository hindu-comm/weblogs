AFTER 150 YEARS, the people of India are still groping in the dark to pinpoint the exact legacy of **Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi** thanks to reams of propaganda that has managed to obfuscate several important truths that would provide us a clear picture about the man.

Any honest attempt at this exercise will be rewarding if it proceeds to examine the said legacy based on Mohandas Gandhi the committed freedom fighter, the shrewd mass leader, the crafty politician, and the vacuous, Christian moralist. This exercise necessarily involves studying Gandhi’s life-work: his writing, speeches and deeds. After all, Gandhi himself famously declared, “my life is my message.”
