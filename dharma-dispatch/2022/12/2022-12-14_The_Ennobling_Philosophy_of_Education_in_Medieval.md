## Introduction

SRI K.A. NILAKANTA SASTRI is justly known for his most famous work, *A History of South India.* Sri Sastri wrote prolifically, churning out some twenty-five full-fledged works on various aspects of south Indian history in a distinguished career spanning about half a century. His primary focus was the culture and history of the Tamil country and people for which he had an abiding passion.

What is lesser known are his contributions to various journals and magazines. It is here that we find some rare gems all but forgotten now. One such gem is his longform essay he wrote in an academic journal on the education system in the Tamil Desam from the pre-medieval and medieval times. The essay is notable for a wealth of cultural insights and the underlying philosophical impulses that informed this education system.

The following are some eye-opening excerpts from this brilliant study. After reading it, the contrast between that profound system and the generation-destroying cauldron that today’s “education” in Tamil Nadu signifies will become self-evident.

Minor editorial changes have been made.

Happy reading!
