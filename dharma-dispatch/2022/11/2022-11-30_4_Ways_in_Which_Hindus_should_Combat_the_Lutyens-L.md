THE PURANIC STORY OF Raktabijasura is one of my all-time favourites. Very briefly, Raktabijasura is a *Rakshasa*, a demon who is endowed with a boon that he thinks will make him deathless. Accordingly, each time a single drop of blood falls from his body, a new Raktabijasura is born. That pretty much sums up the entire sleaze-town called the Indian English media. Given that the original Raktabijasura was bombed out of power in 2014, these mini and micro-mini Raktabijasuras have mushroomed across the landscape of public discourse. They are waging the proverbial battle of a million cuts against India in the following order of priority enemies:

1.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi

2.  Amit Shah-led Bharatiya Janata Party

3.  The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

4.  Everything and everybody that stands for Hinduism in any respect

How do you vanquish an opponent like that? Fortunately, our Devatas had someone like Kali who annihilated Raktabijasura. Our contemporary challenges are slightly different, to put it mildly.

Without further ado, here are **four** major ways in which Hindus can and *must* counter these modern-day media Raktabijasura progenies.
