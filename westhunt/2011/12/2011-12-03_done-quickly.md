Done Quickly

I’ve never seen anyone talk about it much, but when you think about mass
extinctions, you also have to think about rates of change

You can think of a species occupying a point in a many-dimensional
space, where each dimension represents some parameter that influences
survival and/or reproduction: temperature, insolation, nutrient
concentrations, oxygen partial pressure, toxin levels, yada yada yada.
That point lies within a zone of habitability – the set of environmental
conditions that the species can survive. Mass extinction occurs when
environmental changes are so large that many species are outside their
comfort zone.

The key point is that, with gradual change, species adapt. In just a
few generations, you can see significant heritable responses to a new
environment. Frogs have evolved much greater tolerance of acidification
in 40 years (about 15 generations). Some plants in California have
evolved much greater tolerance of copper in just 70 years.

As this happens, the boundaries of the comfort zone move. Extinctions
occur when the rate of environmental change is greater than the rate of
adaptation, or when the amount of environmental change exceeds the limit
of feasible adaptation. There are such limits: bar-headed geese fly
over Mt. Everest, where the oxygen partial pressure is about a third of
that at sea level, but I’m pretty sure that no bird could survive on the
Moon.

What this means is that, when considering environmental changes that are
within the limits of adaptation, rapid changes are much more likely to
cause a mass extinction than slow changes. An asteroid strike (of
sufficient megatonnage) is far more likely to cause a mass extinction
than changes in sea level. I’m not saying that an asteroid is the only
way to cause a mass extinction: I’m saying that an abrupt event is far
more effective than a slow change of the same magnitude. For creatures
with short generations, like insects, even 1000 years looks slow.

Several *orders* of insects disappeared in the Permo-Triassic
extinction, the biggest of all. Whatever caused that extinction must
have been a humdinger.

Paleontologists prefer gradualist explanations for mass extinctions, but
they must be wrong, for the most part.
