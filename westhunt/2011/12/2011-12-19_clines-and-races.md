Clines and Races

Often we hear people argue that that racial classifications are
arbitrary, and therefore race does not exist. Actually they say a lot
of things, most of which are pretty nebulous, but this point does come
up. What if they were right – about racial classifications being
arbitrary? I can conceive of a world where that was the case.

In this hypothetical world, human genetic variation is purely clinal.
At one end of a long narrow continent, there is one set of gene
frequencies, while the gene frequencies at the other end of the
continent are significantly different. In between, the gene frequencies
vary linearly. For example, if the A and B alleles of a particular gene
have frequencies of 90% and 10% at the east end of the continent and
frequencies of 20% and 80% at the west end, the frequencies in the
middle will be 55% and 45%. Phenotypes also vary continuously. There is
no natural divide, no seam, no non-arbitrary way to separate the
population into two or more groups. But… that says nothing about how
different the east  
end and west end populations are. There are clinal species like this
where the two end populations can’t even interbreed.

Red-green color blindess might exist in 8% of west-end males and 1% of
east-end males. The DRD4 7-R allele might have a frequency of 70% in
west-enders and a quarter of a percent in east-enders. A number of
alleles that tend to increase height might be more common at one end
than the other, such that people at the high end average more than a
foot taller. Those kinds of differences certainly exist in humans,
although their distribution is not as simple as in this example.

When the inhabitants of this boring parallel world develop better
transportation, people will move long distances from their place of
origin. We might end up with a colony of east-enders in a west-end
metropolis – call it Gotham. The Gothamites think that those east-enders
are different – and they’re right. Maybe they’re stiff business
competition, maybe they’re dumb and dangerous. Maybe they’re curious and
twitchy. Certainly they look different. You can’t say they’re a
separate race, in a scientific sense – but what does that matter? The
important fact is that the east-enders are biologically different and
that the difference has a social impact. Classification issues are
irrelevant.

If we dropped a few fusion bombs on the middle of that continent,
suddenly there *would* be a natural seam. In the long run, that
interruption of gene flow might have interesting consequences. But in
the short run, it wouldn’t make any difference at all. Back in Gotham,
the existence or nonexistence of a natural seam between populations has
no consequences.
