Move Along, Nothing to See Here, No Selection After All

In August of 2010 Ann Gibbons wrote a perceptive
[column](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5993/740.full?sid=90104d17-8a32-489b-a3d8-965f1093c444)
in *Science* about the literature finding evidence for positive
selection in the human genome. She described the burst of papers in the
late 2000s on the topic and how they had recently slowed to a trickle.
Many investigators seemed to have concluded (correctly) that exploiting
linkage disequilibrium between putatively selected SNPs had reached the
end of the road and that new methods and approaches were in order.

We had been [part](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/52/20753.abstract) of
the flurry of such papers and we watched the chatter among colleagues
about these issues with great interest. Perhaps part of the
retrenchment, we thought at the time, reflected this email from nih.gov
which many of us received. (Email addresses edited out.)

Remarkable, isn’t it? They have no shame in DC. This meeting was put on
by the Bioethics people at NHGRI (National Human Genome Research
Institute), who get 10% of the Institute budget. Ten percent of a lot of
money is *still* a lot of money. This does suggest a place for our
government to trim wasteful spending while at the same time making
science better.

Unfortunately I stubbed my toe and was unable to attend. I also felt
that since I was not a customer of this particular bank there was no
good reason for me to show up.

Soon afterward we began getting subtle and not so subtle hints and
warnings from colleagues that there was after all not so much selection
in humans as we and others had proposed. A killer paper was being
prepared by the Chicago folks showing this, pricking the selection
balloon, and we needed to hunker down and get ready to retract things
that we had written.

We waited and waited, until finally the dreaded
[paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000500)
appeared with the roar of a mouse. The argument seemed to be that since
populations that differed in putatively neutral genes also differed in
putatively selected genes, the pattern was really not so different, and
many of the selection candidates were likely just neutral. Or something
like that. We still have no very clear idea what they were saying: it is
after all hardly a surprise that the Sahara, for example, would block
both neutral gene flow and the spread of selected alleles.

Fortunately our government’s clumsy foray into censorship seems to have
had no lasting effect. There is no record of this meeting at the NHGRI
website that we can find, and a report on the meeting by Cho, Sabeti,
and Tishkoff, cited as *in press* in several places on the web,
apparently never appeared.

Studies of selection and differentiation of human populations are alive
and well.
