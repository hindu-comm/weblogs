Synthetic Men of Mars

Let us suppose that Elon Musk makes substantial progress in Mars
colonization. There’s a problem\* – it’s not clear that current Earth
humans could thrive there. The gravity is a lot lower: we know that zero
G is bad for you, and 0.376 of Earth standard might not be survivable,
over a lifetime.

But that’s no reason to give up. Evolution has solved a lot harder
problems than that, and likely our genetic engineers could as well. The
solution is changing the DNA, redesigning human physiology for low
gravity. while we’re at it, I’m sure we’d want to make a number of
other improvements, most of which already exist in the spectrum of human
variation.

It would be easy to design in or select for increased intelligence ( av
140) , so that they would be able to learn new tasks more rapidly \[
with as few as 5 repetitions !\] . While we’re at it, they should also
have a built-in willingness to learn, and an eagerness to have a
purpose. They should be curious – and stronger than typical Terrans#.

Although there would be variation within this new population, they would
have significant average phenotypic differences from every Earth
population. On any given trait ( other than tolerance for low gravity)
there would be some overlap with existing human populations, although
perhaps not very much in some traits ( like intelligence).

But, although instantly recognizable, significantly different in genome
and phenotype, and many ways quite formidable, those Martians would not
be a different race. Why?

Because Carl Zimmer and David Reich have recently discovered, a
population isn’t really a race – not matter how different – unless it’s
been around a long, long time. Five thousand years isn’t nearly
enough. Previous definitions of races or subspecies never mentioned
this, so it must be a new discovery.

And by the same inexorable argument, German Shepherds, developed in
1899, *do not exist.*There is no such breed.I wish this had been
generally known back when I had a paper route, because if I had just
known that the beast on my Sunday route didn’t really exist, either he
wouldn’t have bitten me or at minimum it would have hurt less.



\*Several, actually.
