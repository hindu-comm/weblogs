Thrall’s Saga

There’s a new
[paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/iceland-s-founding-fathers-underwent-rapid-1000-year-genetic-shift)
out on Iceland’s demography. Originally, Iceland was roughly half
Scandihoovian and half bog-trotters. But today, the islanders are about
70% Norse.

The authors think that this was probably genetic drift. They are wrong.
Those Gaelic ancestors came in as thralls: they didn’t own land.
Iceland was a tough place to survive in: landowners did better.

This should be obvious, particularly since the authors are themselves
Icelandic. Perhaps they are not descendants of Aud the Deep-Minded
(Ketilsdottir).

Correction: I foolishly believed the short description by Michael Price,
rather than reading the whole article, which is behind a paywall. Price
misunderstood the article: the authors do not think that the shift
towards Scand was caused by drift, but rather by reduced opportunities
for slaves – perfectly sensible.
