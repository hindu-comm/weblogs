Yellow fever

Yellow fever is a viral disease that probably originated in Africa- it
used to be a big problem in the Caribbean. It occasionally showed up on
the South, sometimes as far north as Philadelphia. Nobody understood
how it was transmitted \[*Aedes aegypti*mosquitoes\] and nobody knew
how to treat it.

It was deadly – but it was deadlier to some races than others. It hit
people of European ancestry harder – *much* harder. Blacks and whites
were approximately equally likely to catch it, but infected whites were
far more likely to die. The case fatality rate was about [7 times
higher](http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/3/e01253-14.full) for whites than
blacks.

This difference is surely a consequence of long exposure to yellow fever
among sub-Saharan Africans, particularly in west and central Africa,
exposure that selected for resistance to yellow fever. As far as I know
no one has discovered genetic variants that protect against yellow
fever, not least because close study of yellow fever is dangerous.
There’s a \[ somewhat risky\] vaccine for yellow fever, but I don’t
know of any useful protective drugs.
