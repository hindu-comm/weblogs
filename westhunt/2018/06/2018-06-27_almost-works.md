Almost works

I’m looking for examples of chemical reactions, industrial processes,
gadgets, that almost work. The laws of physics suggest that the thing is
possible, but we haven’t found a way to do it, or maybe we can, but it’s
uneconomical or painfully inefficient. Or sometimes just a contrast
between actual performance and the theoretical maximum.
