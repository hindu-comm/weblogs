Go and look

I have said this before, but since fetal cells can linger in mothers for
a long time, while maternal cells can be transmitted to offspring, there
is a niche for a kind of cell that is transmitted indefinitely through
the female line, and that would almost certainly have beneficial
effects, at least on females. This might show up as a growing mtdna
haplotype.

It’s a niche, and niches end up inhabited – like the cell line
infections in marine filter feeders, which phenom was predicted well in
advance of detection.

If you found something like this it would make your career. Especially
if it were found in humans.
