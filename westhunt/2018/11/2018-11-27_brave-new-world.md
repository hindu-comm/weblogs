Brave New World

Since I just found out that someone already wrote the story about
Sauron as the doomed hero leading an abortive Industrial Revolution,
was thinking about a different fantasy world: one in which the
environmentalists were correct. One where interventions work & have
lasting, significant, results. Head Start equalizes. Guys, after a hitch
in the Job Corps, are far more employable then they were before. Pre-K
materially improves outcomes, even without p-hacking ( which is hardly
necessary, since the world works the way that social psychologists wish
it did). Adopted kids, exposed to the same family environment, are just
like the true-blood children, not especially likely to be screwed up.

MZ twins don’t even look like each other.

Race does not exist. Well, people look a little different, but given
similar environments, they have the same chance of winning the 100-meter
dash, or becoming first-rate mathematicians.

Teenage girls are just as likely to wrap their jalopy around a telephone
pole as their boyfriends – at least, that became true when we modernized
childcare.

Going to elite schools actually makes you smarter – and the negatives
are less than here, because over there the crap that they push is true.

Left-wing behavioral geneticists are working fast food, since their
subject does not exist, but at least they’re *happy*.

The Soviet Union, which still exists, exports massive quantities of
Arctic wheat.

You can train a basset hound to act just like a Chihuahua.

Gaps faded away: they just had to.

Given a chance, along with some DDT and chloroquine, Africans start
exporting scads of high-end cars and machine tools, while winning Nobels
and proving the ERH. Not only that: places like Indonesia and Pakistan
and Nigeria are great powers, perfectly capable of inventing and
building new superweapons, perfecting armored warfare, and coming up
with – and implementing – demented ideologies that devastate whole
continents. Africa and South America are wracked by industrialized total
war. Poison gas, not machetes ! Brazil is the country of the present –
and always will be.

Of course, you have to be real careful raising toddlers, because even
looking at them sideways can leave them psychologically crippled. The
right kind of toilet training is crucial. Detached moms can inflict
autism without hardly trying: overprotective moms can turn any boy gay.
Although that’s also, at the same time, entirely genetic, unlike
anything else.

And considering how awful the results of bad early environments can be,
it’s a wonder how the children of the Depression ever managed to do
more than chip flint.
