So I’m saying there’s a chance

<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5447151/human-chimp-hybrid-born-florida-lab-killed-humanzee/>

> A HUMAN-chimpanzee hybrid was born in a Florida lab 100 years ago
> before being killed by panicked doctors, claims a renowned scientist.
>
> Evolutionary psychologist Gordon Gallup coined the term “humanzee”
> which refers to a human-chimp crossbreed – a scientifically possible
> hybridisation which was attempted throughout the 20th century.
>
> Gallup, who developed the famous mirror “self-recognition” test which
> proved primates could acknowledge their own reflection, claims his
> former university professor told him that a humanzee baby was born at
> a research facility where he used to work.
>
> Speaking to The Sun Online, he said: “One of the most interesting
> cases involved an attempt which was made back in the 1920s in what was
> the first primate research centre established in the US in Orange
> Park, Florida.
>
> “They inseminated a female chimpanzee with human semen from an
> undisclosed donor and claimed not only that pregnancy occurred but the
> pregnancy went full term and resulted in a live birth.
>
> “But in the matter of days, or a few weeks, they began to consider the
> moral and ethical considerations and the infant was euthanised.”
>
> Gallup said the professor worked at Yerkes before the research centre
> moved to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia in 1930.
>
> He added: “He told me the rumour was true. And he was a credible
> scientist in his own right.”
