Known to but a few

I’m told that geneticists had seen the weird Andamanese-like component
in Brazilian Amerindians years before anyone published. It was just too
weird: insiders knew, but they didn’t tell. Something like the
upper-atmosphere lightning, known to pilots for decades before it became
officially true.

So what do you and your homies know that’s not ready for prime time?
