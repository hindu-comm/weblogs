I don’t need to forgive my enemies.

that around 4500 years ago, the existing Y-chromosomes in Iberia were
almost entirely replaced. “The collision of these two populations was
not friendly; instead, the men who arrived almost completely pushed out
the local men.” Spanish scientistÍñigo Olalde said that after the
transition. populations had “40% of their genetic information and 100%
of their Y chromosomes from the migrants.”

Which is considerably more drastic than what happened when the Spanish
and Portuguese conquered and settled Latin America – even though that
was aided by catastrophic new diseases. Apparently some of the Iberians
ended up speaking Indo-European languages while others did not. We’ve
seen other examples of male mediated-conquests, and language acquisition
can go either way: Melanesians conquered Fiji, largely replacing the Y
chromosomes, without replacing the language. In Vanuatua, multiple
waves of invasion almost completely replaced the whoe genome while
preserving Polynesian. But the Spanish and Portuguese imposed their
languages, as did Aryans in India, and fairly small numbers of Turks and
Magyars.
