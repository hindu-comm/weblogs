Stability

A few left-wing biologists are trying to spread the meme that highly
polygenic traits are unstable: they might play out entirely differently
in a different environment, presumably in a way that zeroes or reverses
any trait differences that they don’t like. This is a defensive play:
they’re trying to prepare you to disbelieve in the logical implications
of likely near-future research results.

As I have pointed out
[before](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2018/08/12/monogenic-vs-polygenic/),
there is no reason to believe that polygenic traits are especially
unstable,. Since most products of natural selection are polygenic, if
this were true you’d all the time be seeing complex adaptations go
screwy when you moved the species to a new continent or whatever: this
doesn’t often happen. On the other hand, it *does* happen when you move
Pak from Pak-home to Earth: tree-of-life root doesn’t grow here, due to
the thallium shortage. Maybe that’s what they’re thinking of. But
that’s a typical product of insidious tnuctipun genetic engineering, not
natural selection: it was a designed-in failure mode.

One interesting example: how do hits for educational attainment work in
men vs how they work in women? Despite what feminists may say, those
are substantially different environments – hormonally quite different,
for example, and with a fair amount of differences in the central
nervous system – like brain volume, relative amounts of grey and white
matter, etc.

So, what are the differences in how EA snps work in the two sexes ( yes,
there are only two)?

Apparently, there are no such differences.
