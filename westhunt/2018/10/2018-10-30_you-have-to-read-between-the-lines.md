You have to read between the lines

A few years back, Henry Harpending was giving a talk at the University
of Michigan, and a prof there ( Richard Nisbett ) corralled him for a
couple of hours, before the talk.

Nisbett (who often argues in favor of the importance of environmental
influences on intelligence) was interested in our paper (The Natural
History of Ashkenazi Intelligence). He thought we were probably right (
in that particular case). Yet in public comments, he seemed to say that
we were wrong. Henry mentioned a particular example criticizing NHAI,
and asked Nisbett why he’d written that, if he thought the opposite.
Nisbett said ” You have to read between the lines.”
