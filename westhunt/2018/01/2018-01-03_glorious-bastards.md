Glorious Bastards

A while ago I
[mentioned](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2017/01/27/turok-of-the-north/)
Neil Turok’s search for the African Einstein, which doesn’t seem to have
had much success. I’ve thought of a more efficient search strategy that
should be fairly easy to execute.

Search for Feynman’s bastards (and by this point, their children). It
should be easy enough, with modern DNA technology. While we’re at it we
might look for the unofficial offspring of other people of high
accomplishment. People like Svante Pääbo. Hopefully smarter than Svante.

I know that paternal uncertainty is generally low, but winning a Nobel
may make a difference.
