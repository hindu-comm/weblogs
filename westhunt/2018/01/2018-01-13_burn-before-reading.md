Burn Before Reading

IN a recent conversation, Steven Pinker suggests that some students
become radicalized when they find that there truths that are unsayable
on campus. He gave some examples.

!. Capitalism is just plain better than communism

2\. Men and women do not have identical life priorities, tastes and
interests, or exactly the same sexuality.

3\. Different ethnic groups have different crime rates

4\. The great majority of suicidal terrorists are Islamic.

Deep stuff.

Seems to that this is an incomplete list. I call for suggestions from
the audience: more such truths, more details, etc. With a little work
weâ€™ll provide one-stop shopping.
