Poison Ivy Halls

I’m going to review Bryan Caplan’s new book, [The Case Against
Education](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691174652/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=the10000yeaex-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0691174652&linkId=e2b029383206bfb9bf445f9292113e2b).
Will discuss it, and general educational issues, with James Miller \[in
an upcoming podcast\]. This will eventually include a definitive
prescription for fixing American education, not that anyone will pay any
attention.

The GoFundMe linke is
[here](//www.gofundme.com/the-case-against-education). You can also send
money via Paypal ( Use the donate button) , or bitcoins to
1Jv4cu1wETM5Xs9unjKbDbCrRF2mrjWXr5. In-kind donations, such as copies of
Claudius’ Etruscan dictionary, or Pytheas of Massalia’s “On the Ocean”,
or James’s Schmitz’s “Karres Venture”, would be appreciated as well.
