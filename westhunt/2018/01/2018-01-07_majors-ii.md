Majors, II

I talked about what people major in
[earlier](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/11/22/majors/), but
[this](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/05/09/310114739/whats-your-major-four-decades-of-college-degrees-in-1-graph)
is useful, I think. I’m revving up for some posts about education.

A question: I’d like to hear some thoughts about which degrees are
worthless. Define you terms. For example\< I can imagine degrees that
teach you to do things that are useful but somehow out of fashion,
useless but highly in demand, useful to you but worse than useless to
society as a whole, etc.
