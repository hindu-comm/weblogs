Why Adopted Children Still Struggle Over Time

I noticed an
[article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/adoption-happily-ever-after-myth/418230)
in the Atlantic, about much higher rates of disability, behavior and
learning problems, suspensions. Lower achievement on reading, math, and
science assessment tests. They canâ€™t figure it out.

There must be something attractive about living in a constant fog of
mystery. Who knew that dogs bite men?
