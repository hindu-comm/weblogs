More Theory

I’ve been pondering some of the points Robert Plomin has made in
Blueprint, and I find myself thinking about some things that he doesn’t
say, but should have. All this in the context of a book that is
generally sensible.

Imagine a certain kind of personality variation: some people are
aggressive, some not. The aggressive guys tend to prevail over the
peaceful, but get in trouble from fighting each other when common: so
you get an equilibrium, where both have the same average fitness.
Hawk-dove, a la George Price and Maynard Smith. You might like or
dislike hawks or doves, but you couldn’t say that either kind of
personality was a disease ( A Darwinian disease, the only reasonably
definition of disease). Now if those traits were influenced by many
genes, there would be continuous variation, but that can be a stable
state too, an ESS. Maybe some people would go too far, be too far out
on the curve of aggressiveness or way too passive – say four sigma out
– they might well have lower fitness, and maybe you could call that a
disease – but it’s really just the far edge of a strategy.

Another case: tertiary syphilis, which used to be a common cause of
mental illness, with whole wings of mental hospitals dedicated to it.
Clearly a Darwinian disease.

Again: you find that having more mutational load, more deleterious
mutations, increased your chance of schizophrenia, or autism, or low IQ:
that strongly suggests schizophrenia, autism , and low IQ are not the
far edge of some strategy. Note: people talking about shamans and schiz:
you’re probably wrong. Same for autism – not a strategy.

It is not so easy to for us to determine just how deleterious a mutation
is by looking at the sequence, but natural selection gives a strong
hint: if they’re bad, they’re rare. And,on the whole, if they’re rare,
they’re bad.

Plomin notes that “there is an excess of rare mutations inindividuals
with schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability”, and also says
that “individuals of extremely high intelligence have fewer of
theserare mutations”, suggesting that “rare mutations are not good for
you.”

But we knew that before we looked: theory, population genetics, says
that deleterious variants will be rare. Selection happens. Now maybe
Plomin is simplifying things for the average reader, but I get the
nagging feeling that he doesn’t know much about evolutionary game
theory, mutational load, mutation-selection balance, truncation
selection. I don’t think that most behavioral geneticists ever took any
courses covering such things – or am I wrong? Most started as
psychologists, or so I’m told.

There are interesting results that make sense if (and only if) you’re
thinking in terms of mutational load: intelligence is extremely
polygenic, and if you have fewer bad mutations that influence IQ (true
on average for people with high IQ) – you have fewer total bad
mutations. Lower mutational load, which should result in better health
and increased lifespan – and apparently does.

He also says “that the abnormal is normal, meaning that there are no
qualitativedisorders, just quantitative dimensions. The many DNA
differencesthat are associated with what we call a disorder affect
peoplethroughout the distribution.” I don’t think that’s the clearest
way of looking at things: better to say that we all have some
deleterious mutations, while some people have more than average. But
there really is a qualitative difference between what works and what
doesn’t.
