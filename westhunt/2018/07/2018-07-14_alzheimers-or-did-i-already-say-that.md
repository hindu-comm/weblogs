Alzheimers, or did I already say that?

[More](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2016/05/29/alzheimers/) studies
are suggesting that Alzheimer’s disease may be caused by a persistent
viral infection of the brain. Autopsy studies show that Alzheimer’s
victims have higher viral load. A couple of other recent studies in
Taiwan suggest that antiviral drugs may significantly reduce the
incidence of Alzheimer’s.

And of course we have the long record of complete failure of therapies
based on the amyloid hypothesis.

Many of these recent articles mention that most people in the
Alzheimer’s research community are violently opposed to any pathogen
hypothesis, or probably anything other than the amyloid hypothesis. I
see phrases like “venomous hostility” used.

Truly I don’t get why. I see no political angle of any kind, no
emotional hook – the only thing I can imagine is that personal and
community investment in a given approach makes it very hard, almost
impossible to admit a mistake. Is that enough, all by itself?
