Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are

I’m going to review Robert Plomin’s new book, [Blueprint:How DNA
Makes Us Who We
Are.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262039168/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=the10000yeaex-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0262039168&linkId=f0973d2d07437e3b3f09435a2adacdd4)
It’ll show up in Quillette . By the way, I should someday write a piece
for them about how I **am not** a moderate left-winger who was
eventually left behind by the Left getting ever crazier. I would also
**not** talk about how the New York Times used to be a great paper. Was
that when they called for McClellan to be made dictator, or when they
informed Goddard of the “need to have something better than a vacuum
against which to react against.” ?

Probably there will be a podcast. The GoFundMe link
