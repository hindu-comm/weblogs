Occam’s Butterknife

” Picture this nursery school scene: 10 1-year-olds are squeezed next to
one another on a bench, their backs against a wall. They sit motionless.
None cry, push or shove.

A woman attendant takes a small windup toy chicken out of a box, turns
the key and lets it strut across the floor past the infants’ feet.
Again, none of the children move or try to grab the toy, as their
American counterparts surely would. They simply follow it with their
eyes.

Finally, one boy cannot resist. He toddles over and pounces on the
chicken. The attendant gently picks him up and deposits him back on the
bench.

The episode took place one recent morning in the neat gray brick nursery
school and kindergarten run by the Peking Printing and Dyeing factory
for 270 children of its workers. But it is similar to scenes acted out
in tens of thousands of preschool classes all across China. Visitors Are
Impressed

American visitors to China are continually impressed, indeed often
amazed, by the almost universal good behavior of Chinese children. They
are quiet, obedient, quick to follow their teachers’ instructions, and
they seldom exhibit the boisterous aggressiveness or selfishness of
American children.”

In the New York Times, by Fox Butterfield himself, who must be the
avatar of some totally clueless god.

I mean, really: quiet one-year-olds???
