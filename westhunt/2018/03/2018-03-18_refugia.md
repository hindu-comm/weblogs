Refugia

Sometimes a population has effective adaptations that protect against a
very serious local problem – a problem so serious that outsiders that
don’t have those special adaptations cannot invade, at least not without
a fair amount of gene flow from the locals. Due to tropical diseases,
much of Sub-Saharan Africa was like that.

We know that one of the key alleles in the Tibetan altitude response
comes from Denisovans, which implies that some Denisovans spent a long
time at high altitude. Suppose that they occupied Tibet. Could modern
humans have invaded Tibet? Even if they could, might it have taken much
longer than elsewhere? Might Denisovans have lingered longer in Tibet
than elsewhere?
