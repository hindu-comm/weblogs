The hijab of ignorance

If you didn’t know which position you’d be born into in society, you
would choose, not egalitarianism, but a form of society that maximized
the rate of technological progress. That would increases your chance of
living in a world with penicillin, Mozart, and pizza – all far more
important than social position. Since you don’t know *when* you’re going
to be born, either.

Better bullshit™ than Rawls.
