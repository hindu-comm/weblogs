Wyld Stallyns, Part Deux

A while ago, I
[wondered](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/wyld-stallyns/) if
modern stallions are a male morph adapted to domestication, one in which
the strategy is mediated via the Y chromosome.

Looks as if I was right\*. Check out [“Decline of genetic diversity in
ancient domestic stallions in
Europe”](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/4/eaap9691).

Selection favored one particular kind of Y-chromosome. This had to be
based on phenotype, not genealogy. Most likely it was favored under the
new environment of domestication. Somehow, these stallions performed
better, or were easier to get along with (my bet).

We already knew that Y-chromosomes could do things: Haplogroup I
increases the risk of heart disease by about 50%, while the particular
variant of Y chromosome influences aggression in mice.

Which means you have to re-examine the starburst phylogeny of R1b and
R1a: it’s probably biology, rather than history, that drove those
expansions. Some kind of selective advantage. Possibly one reason that
those particular Y chromosomes far outraced steppe autosomal
contributions. Most likely, R1a and R1b induce specific morphs – their
carriers are somehow different. Maybe they’re born to be mild, or born
to be princes of the universe. Maybe an R1b guy just finds it easier to
cooperate with other R1b guys… Or maybe they’re resistant to typhoid.

\* correct predictions mean nothing in biology. Ask any biologist.
