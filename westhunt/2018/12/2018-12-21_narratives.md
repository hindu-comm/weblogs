Narratives

There’s a bit of excitement about Claas Relotius, a reporter for Der
Spiegel who has the bad habit of making everything up. In one case, he
wrote a ” tendentious, malicious portrait” of a small town in Minnesota
( Fergus Falls), one chock-full of falsehoods. A couple of the locals
went to some effort to show that he lied: not sure whether that
contributed to his downfall or not.

Of course this is not the same as repeating or contributing to those
lies that everyone is supposed to embrace. That’s normal: you can get a
Pulitzer for those.. Relotius, on the other hand, was sick: just ask
him.

I am reminded of the time that Bella Stumbo, a reporter for the Los
Angeles times, wrote an article about the small Midwestern town I grew
up in. My favorite bit was about the once-a-year trek of the farm
families into town to buy supplies.
