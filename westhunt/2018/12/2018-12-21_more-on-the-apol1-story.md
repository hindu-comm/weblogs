More on the APOL1 story

As I have mentioned
[before](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/apol1-variants/),
there are a couple of common mutations of the APOL1 gene ( (G1 and G2)
that protect against one strain of sleeping sickness, but unfortunately
greatly increase the risk of kidney failure. The story was unsimple
because they didn’t seem to protect against the other strain of
sleeping sickness, the one that’s currently common in populations
carrying G1 and G2. The first guess was that the other strain used to be
common there and was replaced by a different strain, somehing like what
may have happened in central Africa, where almost everyone is immune to
vivax malaria, but you don’t see much vivax there ( instead,
falciparum).

A recent
[publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495568/)
clarifies things a bit. First, the two strains of human sleeping
sickness are*Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,*which causes the acute
East African form, and*T.b. gambiense,* which causes the more chronic
West African form.

G2 gives strong protection against infection by the East African strain,
but appears to increase vulnerability to the West African strain. G1
doesn’t do much against the East African strain, but allow asymptomatic
carriage of the West African strain – better survival, rather than
resistance to infection.
