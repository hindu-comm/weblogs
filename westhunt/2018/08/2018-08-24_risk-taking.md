Risk-taking

Some ( including insurance companies) have claimed that young men are
more likely to take risks than young women. [Cordelia
Fine](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/old-t-rex/) says that
”The reported gender gap in risk-taking would almost certainly narrow
if researchers’ questionnaires started to include more items like: ‘How
likely is it that you would bake an impressive but difficult souffléfor
an important dinner party? ”

This strongly suggests – strongly ! – that she is and always has been my
sock-puppet, because how could anyone real deliberately make such a
stupid comparison? Making asoufflé, vsbasejumpers, guys that drive 125
miles an hour when drunk, climb the Eiger, or flew a Spitfire against
the Luftwaffe?

It would take congenital brain damage, heavy drugs, **and** neurosurgery
to be that dense. Possibly generations of dysgenic selection as well.
I’ve know smarter goldfish.
