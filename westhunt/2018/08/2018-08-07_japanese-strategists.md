Japanese strategists

In World War II. It’s not clear that there actually were any. This
isn’t always mentioned in histories, but a lot of what Japan did in the
Pacific made no sense at all.

For example, the Japanese occupied lots of islands. After their local
naval and air forces had been defeated, we only needed a few of those
islands for bases. We generally just let the Japanese forces on the
islands we didn’t need sit there, usually till the end of the war. Some
farmed and fished, some starved.

But island-hopping had important strategic fallout. There was only one
way to send any supplies to places like Rabaul – submarines. Of course,
they couldn’t carry enough cargo to make any difference – they sure
couldn’t feed 100,000 men – but you gotta do *something*, right? This
took most of the Japanese submarine fleet out of the war.
