Big Science

Most scientific knowledge has been developed by individuals puttering
around in labs. Labs, not something the size of the Pyramids or Hoover
Dam. But sometimes it has been produced in large, expensive projects and
installations. Cutting-edge optical telescopes are big projects, true
also for radio telescopes, definitely true for Ice Cube and LIGO. The
same for particle physics, with SLAC and Fermilab and CERN.

Those big-science projects have been successful, but they haven’t been
useful. They have produced almost exactly nothing of economic value. I
get the impression that their builders would have been disappointed if
they *had* been useful. That’s wrong thinking: a richer society could
afford more physics!

I can think of at least two big-science projects that would make big
money, as well as DOING GOOD and LEAVING FOOTPRINTS IN THE SANDS OF TIME
. But how to get them off the ground? Policymakers are pretty skeptical
about claims of big payoffs, since they’ve been lied to for
generations, while investors are apparently looking for chicks with
weird voices wearing turtlenecks.

Unlike the products of the Demon Princes of Silicon Valley, what I’m
thinking about would be truly useful.
