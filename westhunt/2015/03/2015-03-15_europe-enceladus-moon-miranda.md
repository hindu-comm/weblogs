Europa, Enceladus, Moon Miranda

A lot of ice moons seem to have interior oceans, warmed by tidal flexing
and possibly radioactivity. But they’re lousy candidates for life,
because you need free energy; and there’s very little in the interior
oceans of such system.

It is possible that NASA is institutionally poor at pointing this out.
