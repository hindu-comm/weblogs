Breadth-first search

When I complain about some egregious piece of research, particularly
those that are in some sense cross-disciplinary, I often feel that that
just knowing more would solve the problem. If Roland Fryer or Oded Galor
understood genetics, they wouldn’t make these silly mistakes. If Qian
and Nix understood genetics or American post-Civil War history, they
would never have written that awful paper about massive passing. Or if
paleoanthropologists and population geneticists had learned about
mammalian hybrids, they would have been open to the idea of Neanderthal
introgression.

But that really amounts to a demand that people learn about five times
as much in college and grad school as they actually do. It’s not going
to happen. Or, perhaps, find a systematic and effective way of
collaborating with people outside their discipline without having their
heads shaved. That doesn’t sound too likely either.
