Infertilty Belt

[![Infertility
Belt](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/infertility-belt.jpg?w=640&h=901)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/infertility-belt.jpg)

It used to be the case (considerably less so today) that a significant
fraction of women in central Africa, up to tens of percent in some
areas, were infertile or subfertile, due to various STDs. This seems to
have been true for quite a while, up until the 1990s and back some
indefinite amount of time, probably at least one or two centuries. It
might be older than that, but at this point nobody knows. There was
enough infertility that colonial administrators worried about keeping up
the population, in the days before readily available antibiotics: for
example, the population of Gabon seems to have decreased between 1930
and 1950.

Most of this infertility was caused through tubal scarring caused by
gonorrhea and chlamydial infections.

If this pattern was around long enough, there could have been
significant selection for resistance to the relevant pathogens, possibly
generating high frequencies of alleles with odd or unpleasant side
effects, as with malaria and sickle-cell/thalassemia etc. This would
depend on the age of the behavior patterns that made this possible, on
the antiquity of the pathogens causing those STDs, etc.
