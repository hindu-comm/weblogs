Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe

They get a selective advantage of 1.5% for the European lactose
tolerance allele: “We estimated the selection coefficient on the derived
allele to be 0.015 (95% confidence interval; CI=0.010-0.034) using a
method that fits a hidden Markov model to the population allele
frequencies as they change over time. ”

That’s way lower than any other result I’ve ever seen, including runs
I’ve done myself. I’ve seen estimates a full ten times higher. I don’t
get it.
