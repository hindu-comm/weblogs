Back by Popular Demand

One of the interesting things about the growing enthusiasm for
transgenerational epigenetics – the kind where your grandfather was poor
or discriminated against which somehow makes you terrible at algebra
today, except not if you’re Korean – is that it has been bottom-up. It
has not been driven by convincing experimental results – of course there
haven’t been any. Instead, it was an idea that appealed: more and more
people in certain circles talked about it, convinced each other by the
most powerful of all arguments (“Wouldn’t it be nice if ?”) and that
eventually drove bullshit experiments and publications. Looking at
Google’s Ngram Viewer, it
[looks](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=epigenetics&year_start=1980&year_end=2008&corpus=17&smoothing=0&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cepigenetics%3B%2Cc0)
as if this particular mental fungus sprouted around 2003.

There may have been a particular article or book that started this wave
of nonsense, but I haven’t found it yet. Even if there was, it only
succeeded because the soil was fertile. It was a bad idea whose time had
come. One can understand some of the motivation: gaps persisted and
persisted in spite of many costly interventions. It must have been
frustrating.

Back in 1940, the Soviet powers that be wanted more wheat (and more dead
kulaks, of course) . Today, our most desired product is excuses.
