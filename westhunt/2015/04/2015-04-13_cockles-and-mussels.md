Cockles, and Mussels

Looking further at that article about a transmissible cancer in clams,
it appears that cell line infections are common in bivalves – oysters,
cockles, mussels – without being recognized as such until now. Could be
true in other filter-feeders – sponges, brachiopods, etc. Gills might
also be a transmission mechanism- so cell line infections may be a
general problem for oceanic organisms.
