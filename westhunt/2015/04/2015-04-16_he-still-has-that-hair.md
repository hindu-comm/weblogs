He still has that hair

Steven Pinker was saying that greatly extending the human lifespan is
hard, maybe impossible: ” I suspect that death will never be conquered
(though our lifespans will continue to increase, at least for a while).
Any cost-free longevity gene or easily tunable molecular pathway would
have been low-hanging fruit for natural selection long ago. Senescence
is baked into most of our genome because of the logic of evolution:
since there’s a nonzero probability at any moment that an organism will
die in an unpreventable accident, making genes for longevity moot,
selection tends to sacrifice longevity for performance at every level of
organization. This means we’d have to know how to tinker with thousands
of genes or molecular pathways, each a tiny (and noisy) effect on
longevity, to make the leap to immortality. The low-hanging fruit is in
fact at the other end of the lifespan and income scale. We’ve made
massive global progress in reducing maternal and infant mortality and
premature death, but we’re not seeing a cohort of billionaire
centagenarians. ” Centenarians.

He’s got the argument backward: sure, natural selection has not favored
perfect repair, so says the evolutionary theory of of senescence. If
it had, then we could perhaps conclude that perfect repair was very hard
to achieve, since we don’t see it, at least not in complex animals.\*
But since it was not favored, since natural selection never even
*tried*, it may not be that difficult.

Any cost-free longevity gene that made you live to be 120 would have had
a small payoff, since various hazards were fairly likely to get you by
then anyway… And even if it would have been favored, a similar gene
that cost a nickel would not have been. Yet we can afford a nickel.

There are useful natural examples: we don’t have to start from scratch.
Bowhead whales live over 200 years: I’m not too proud to learn from
them.

Lastly , this would take a lot of work. So what?

\*Although we can invent things that evolution can’t – we don’t insist
that all the intermediate stages be viable.
