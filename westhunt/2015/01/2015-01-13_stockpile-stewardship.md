Stockpile Stewardship

A lot of our nuclear weapons are old, and it’s not clear that they still
work. If we still did underground tests, we’d know for sure (and could
fix any problems) – but we don’t do that. We have a program called
stockpile stewardship, that uses simulation programs and the data from
laser-fusion experiments in an attempt to predict weapon efficacy.

I talked to some old friends who know as much about the nuclear
stockpile as anyone: neither believes that that stockpile stewardship
will do the job. There are systems that you can simulate with
essentially perfect accuracy and confidence, Newtonian gravitational
mechanics for example: this isn’t one of them.

You had two approaches to a problem that was vital to the security of
the United States: option A was absolutely sure to work, option B might
possibly work.

The Feds picked B.
