Taqiyya

There are opinions that are required in most of academia (and
government, press, etc), if you want to keep your job (or ever be
invited to parties). Naturally, most of them are false or silly: what
would be the point of requiring people to avow things that were
obviously true? That would be like an initiation rite that consisted of
eating an ice-cream cone. Of course, they can only require public
support, not real private belief: as yet there is no “sincerometer”.

In a previous
[post](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/six-black-russians/), a
correspondent mentioned famous environmentalists that privately buy into
our hypothesis on Ashkenazi IQ – I know one of those myself. That’s the
sort of thing I’m wondering about – there are of course others. I don’t
necessarily think that such people are incredibly common – really, I
don’t know – but I would be interested in hearing of other examples.
Famous is good, but really funny is perhaps even better. Mainly I’m
curious.
