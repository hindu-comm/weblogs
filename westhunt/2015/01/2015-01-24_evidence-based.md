Evidence-based

The central notion of evidence-based medicine is that our understanding
of human biology is imperfect. Some of the idea we come up with for
treating and preventing disease are effective, but most are not, worse
than useless. So we need careful, rigorous statistical studies before
implementing those ideas on a wide scale. A good example of doing this
the wrong way was when when doctors started recommending having babies
sleep prone, which roughly doubled the incidence of sudden infant death
syndrome for the next several decades.

It seems to me that our understanding of psychology, sociology,
economics, political science, and education is at least as imperfect as
our understanding of biomedicine.
