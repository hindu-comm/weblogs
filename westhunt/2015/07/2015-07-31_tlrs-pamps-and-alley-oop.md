TLRs, PAMPs, and Alley Oop

I hear that some Eurasians – probably more than some – have Neanderthal
or Denisovan versions of TLRs. Not surprising: we’ve already seen this
happen with other immune system genes – HLA variants ,
[OAS1,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAS1)
[STAT2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT2) all have adaptive variants
that originated with archaic humans.

[TLRs ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor) (Toll-Like
Receptors) are just plain interesting, but I don’t think many people are
familiar with them. They’re part of the innate immune system: they
don’t learn from experience, as happens with the adaptive immune system
(recombination, clonal selection and all that): they just know. Born
that way.

They sense pathogens by detecting molecular patterns characteristic of
major classes of pathogens that we just don’t have. These are called
PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). They can detect
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), characteristic of gram-negative bacteria. and
peptidoglycan, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria. Some detect
viral-double-stranded RNA.

There are ten TLRs in humans. Generally, they react with molecular
patterns that we don’t even have. TLR-1 recognizes bacterial
lipoprotein and peptidoglycans (strep and staph), TLR-2 recognizes
bacterial peptidoglycans( gram-positive bacteria) and zymosan (fungi),
TLR-3 double stranded RNA (viruses) , TLR-4 lipopolysaccharides
(salmonella) , TLR-5 bacterial flagella (listeria) , TLR-6 bacterial
lipoprotein, TLR-7 single-stranded RNA (viruses) , TLR-8 single-stranded
RNA(viruses) , TLR-9 CpG DNA (bacteria) . TLR-10 appears to play an
inhibitory role, down-regulating TLR-2 .

Back in the days when vaccine development was cutting-edge, I think that
people knew that the body automatically reacted to some pathogens, but
it has taken a long time to discover the complex details, not that we’re
quite done yet.

P.S. according to some, one factor inducing Pygmyization was the high
pathogen load in dense tropical jungles. I don’t know if that was the
case, but if so, considering that it looks as if African Pygmies (also
Bushmen) admixed a bit with a very divergent hominid population (more
divergent than Neanderthals) , it wouldn’t be surprising if they picked
up some immune system gene variants that helped deal with that jungle
environment.
