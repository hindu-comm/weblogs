First* Peoples

There are two new papers out on the early colonization of the Americas,
one in Science and one in Nature. The Science paper claims that all
Amerindians stem from a single Siberian population that moved into
Beringia about 23,000 years ago and entered America about 15,000 years
ago, splitting into northern and southern branches about 13,000 years
ago. They also found a touch of Australo-Melanesian ancestry among some,
not all, living Amerindians – they saw it in Aleuts and the Surui (
Amazonian Indians). They concluded that this ancestry must have arrived
well after the initial colonization of the New World: “The widely
scattered and differential affinity of Native Americans to the
Australo-Melanesians, ranging from a strong signal in the Surui to much
weaker signal in northern Amerindians such as Ojibwa, points to this
gene flow occurring after the initial peopling by Native American
ancestors.” In much the same way, the fact that you see widely different
amount of Bushman admixture in Bantu groups in southern Africa ( a lot
in the Xhosa, almost none in some other groups) suggests that the
Bushmen arrived after the Bantu, except that it doesn’t of course.

The Nature paper concentrates on the Australo-Melanesian story: they see
it mainly in the Amazon Basin, 1-2%. The closest extant population is
the Onge, pygmies of the Andaman Islands, but you see this anomalous
relatedness in the Papuans, Australian Aborigines, Mamanwa (Philippine
Negritos), and at lower levels in a number of groups in South Asia. In
many Amerindian groups this component is much weaker or nonexistent.

The authors of the Nature paper believe that this admixture most likely
happened before the settlement of the Americas, but they aren’t sure:
the linkage disequilibrium says some time between 40,000 and 4,000 years
ago, probably after the Ancient North Eurasians mixed into the
Amerindians. They talk about population Y, a separate movement into the
Americas by a population that had probably already acquired this
Australo-Melanesian component.

The background fact is that the earliest skeletons, especially in
Brazil, look like Australo-Melanesians. Long skulls. If population Y
were almost entirely standard Amerindian, with only a smidgen of
Australo-Melanesian ancestry, they would have *looked* like
Amerindians. On the other hand, if the original settlers of the
Americas were mostly or entirely Australo-Melanesian (or more exactly
something vaguely related to those existing populations) they would have
those long, narrow skulls. This is the Paleoamerican model – and if
true, it means that an Onge-like population arrived first, and that the
incoming Amerinds almost completely wiped out them out later, with here
and there a bit of admixture.

As I understand the law, this would mean that we have to build little
casinos inside the existing casinos. For some small establishments,
this might mean designating the proceeds of a single slot machine to
various Amazonian tribes, or possibly to the Onge as next of kin.

\* It’s complicated.
