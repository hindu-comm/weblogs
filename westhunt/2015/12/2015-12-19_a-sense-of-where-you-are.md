A sense of where you are

The New York Times just put out a story titled “Overdose Deaths Exceeded
Half a Million in 2014”. As so very often on reading something in the
Times, I said to myself “that’s wrong.” Because it had to be wrong – off
the top of my head I knew that less than three million died from any
reason each year in the US: pop of \~300 million, three score and ten,
population growth, QED. No way that big a fraction died from overdoses,
and of course it was wrong: the real number is something like 50k,
mostly prescription drugs.

Nobody at the Times noticed it at first. I don’t know that they ever did
notice it by themselves- likely some reader brought it to their
attention. But this happens all the time, because very few people have a
picture of the world in their head that includes any numbers. Mostly
they don’t even have a rough idea of relative size.

In much the same way, back in the 1980s,lots of writers were talking
about 90,000 women a year dying of anorexia nervosa, another impossible
number. Then there was the great scare about 1,000,000 kids being
kidnapped in the US each year – also impossible and wrong. Practically
all the talking classes bought into it.

You might think that the people at the top are different – but with a
few exceptions, they’re just as clueless.

I’m not even counting all the falsehoods that you’re *supposed* to
believe in.
