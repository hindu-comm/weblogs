Degenerate Hobbits

There’s a new report out, claiming that the Flores Hobbits are probably
an island dwarf version of *Homo erectus*, judging by their teeth.

Flores isn’t a very big island – \~5,000 square miles, similar to
Connecticut. There couldn’t have been many hobbits. And they seem to
have been there for a long time, hundreds of thousand of years, judging
from tools found.

Which means that if they were what they seem to be, they would have
suffered far more from genetic load than Neanderthals or Denisovans. All
those problems of slightly deleterious alleles drifting to high
frequencies would be much more serious, and the probability of salvage
mutations would be much lower.. Moreover, the Flores Hobbits *look*
screwed up (unlike Neanderthals), with many skeletal anomalies and
asymmetries. This is why some anthropologists have argued that they are
just diseased modern humans.

Point is, the island-dwarfed erectus story does makes sense, but it
would inevitably result in them being highly screwed up. Like they are.
I talked about this several years ago – “[Back to the
Trees](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/back-to-the-trees/)” –
and suggest that they might have suffered from partial mutational
meltdown – too much load to have an efficient brain. The skeletal
anomalies suggest that their load was pretty serious.
