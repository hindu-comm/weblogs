Safe Spaces

Recently a fair number of college students have been complaining that
various symbols and words (often false flagged) are making them feel
‘unsafe’. I am reminded of something Jim Chapin said: He felt ‘unsafe’
when a couple of 16-year old Irish kids had him down in the gutter and
were trying to kick his ribs in. That’s pretty close to my personal
definition, although there were three of them in the case I’m
remembering….

The more I think about it, the more I suspect that a lot of our present
and future ‘elites’ would develop some valuable perspective from having
someone beat the living crap out of them. Certainly worth a try.
