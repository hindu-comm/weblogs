Left Behind

I’m led to believe that the Singularity could happen abruptly, enough so
that you might miss it if you weren’t paying attention. Two things have
me wondering if it’s already happened.

One, I keep seeing this ad for “Free installation of solar system.”

Two, I was reading a book by Nancy Kress, in which there is a scene
where our heroine encounters a seriously gene-engineered dog. It has
four adorable pink ears, a rabbit’s tail, and eyes as large as saucers.
But it also says “Hello” to our heroine. She thinks “Dogs couldn’t talk.
The vocal equipment didn’t allow it, the law didn’t allow it, the canine
IQ didn’t allow it. ”

But, *my* dog says “Hello”.
