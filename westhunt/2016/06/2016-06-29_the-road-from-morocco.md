The Road From Morocco

[![afr(22-](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/afr22.gif?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/afr22.gif)

It never hurts to look at the map. Back around the glacial maximum, the
world was a crappy place, with fewer inhabitable areas. Some of the high
genetic differentiation in early Holocene populations may have been
caused by climate-induced barriers: glaciers, bigger deserts, glacial
lakes, etc.

The Basal Eurasians had low Neanderthal admixture while still leaving
sub-Saharan Africa. North Africa might fit this scenario. If they made
it to North Africa when conditions were not so bad, they might have been
trapped there for a long time when the Sahara was at its max, and would
only have entered the Middle East after the Neanderthals had already
been displaced. But this means that they probably ran into and admixed
with the locals, either not AMH or some fairly divergent branch of AMH.
