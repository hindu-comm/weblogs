The Idea Factories

Bell Labs was a fount of important inventions, but it was not alone.
Other industrial labs did too: IBM Watson, IBM Zurich, IBM Almaden,
Xerox Palo Alto, Hughes Malibu ( with parquet flooring and a view of the
Pacific, I might add), etc. All the way back to Menlo Park. But theyâ€™re
largely gone.

We could resurrect the industrial labs. Should we?
