The Secret Histories

I was reading Strategikon (of Maurice, not Kekaumenos), a handbook of
military strategy probably authored by the Emperor Maurice. it occurred
to me that the practical military knowledge it contained was effectively
*secret* knowledge, not usually available to enemies of Byzantium.
Sometimes because those enemies were illiterate, more often because
various social and geographic barriers made sneaking out a copy of
Strategikon pretty unlikely. So, secret knowledge, the wisdom of the
Occident.

In principle, the United States ought to have whole secret libraries. I
don’t mean nuclear data from hydrogen bomb tests – I mean the distilled
essence of the greatest minds that have served the Republic. Nathanael
Greene’s musing on how he beat Cornwallis by taking advantage of
multiple definitions of victory. Sherman’s definitive analysis of
Jackson’s Valley Campaign. Nimitz’s inside history of the Pacific war:
he said he never wrote one, because it would hurt people (people like
Halsey), but then he would say that, wouldn’t he. Can’t have people
digging around for the secret history, available only to the War
College’s star pupils…

Only they seem to have been misplaced somehow. Probably they’re all
boxed up in that warehouse, next to the Ark of the Covenant.
