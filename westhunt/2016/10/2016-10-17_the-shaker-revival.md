The Shaker Revival

Sometimes, when watching the ever-accelerating madness spreading through
our ‘elites’, I worry. When Judith Shulevitz says “Scientists mostly
agree that sexual identity is multifarious, not binary: fungible, not
fixed.”, it sure sounds as if the EndTimes are approaching. You can
recognize the fifth Horseman by the arrow through his head.

Then again, if you think about it, it’s just possible that this problem
is going to solve itself. And in so doing, solve many other problems at
the same time.
