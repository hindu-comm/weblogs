Man’s best friend

Steve Hsu has suggested that we might be able to vastly increase human
intelligence via genetic engineering, by finding the many small-effect
alleles that affect IQ and engineering embryos with all-plus versions of
those alleles – leading to people whose IQ would be 30 standard
deviations higher than us yokels.

There are some possible problems with this scenario. The new & improved
humans might not like us. They might be crazy: the risk for certain
kinds of crazy increases with the number of plus alleles. Smarter than
human, they might realize that life is not worth living, then rush out
and do us all a favor.

It risks the death or domestication of the human race.

Now presumably intelligence in dogs is also highly polygenic. We could
find those alleles and engineer super–dogs that were 30 std smarter than
dogs today.

This might be a better idea. Dogs actually *like* us, which is not at
all guaranteed for supermen.

Of course, they’d dominate internet poker, but that’s a a small price to
pay.
