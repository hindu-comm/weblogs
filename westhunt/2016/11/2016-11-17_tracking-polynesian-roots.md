Tracking Polynesian Roots

That late-arriving \~25% Melanesian fraction of autosomal ancestry came
from somewhere – somewhere in particular, some population from New
Guinea or (more likely) the Solomon Islands. People have inhabited the
Solomons for a long time, surely long enough to develop distinct
genetics on different islands – so we may be able to find the source.
Their language, whatever it was, may also have left a trace in the
Polynesian languages.
