Deep Secrets

I noticed some pundits talking about Trump getting his top-secret
briefings. They were musing about the emotional impact of learning the
Government’s ‘deep secrets’.

I wonder. I remember being read into a special access program and
thinking “Is that all there is’?

There is important information that the U.S. government knows that isn’t
on Wiki – details of nuclear weapons, for example – but on the whole I
suspect that there are more truly interesting facts (some of them scary)
that I know and the Feds don’t than the other way around.
