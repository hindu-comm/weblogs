Between the lines

Sometimes when reading a piece in a paper or magazine, I get the
impression that the reporter is not necessarily 100% on board with the
official editorial position, particularly when it is ripely insane, as
is so often the case nowadays. I figure that there must have been many
examples of this in the East Block, back in the day: although you were
dicing with death if you tried it with Stalin. I wondered about this
after reading a bit by Farhad Manjoo, about Peter Thiel, in the New York
Times:

“Though Silicon Valley has well-known problems with diversity in its
work force, people here pride themselves on a kind of militant
open-mindedness. It is the kind of place that will severely punish any
deviations from accepted schools of thought — see how Brendan Eich, the
former chief executive of Mozilla, was run out of his job after it
became public that he had donated to a campaign opposed to gay
marriage.”

You could almost suspect that Manjoo was teetering on the edge of
crimethink.

Stalin, by the way, didn’t have this kind of worry: he was free to say
that that Pavlik Morozov was ‘a rotten little shit, ratting on his
parents like that.’
