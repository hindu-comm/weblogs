Dead Presidents

That time again: time to contribute. You can send funds via Paypal, by
check (to me or to West Hunter Incorporated if you’re after
deductibility).

Many people enjoyed my podcast interview with James Miller. If there is
enough interest and enthusiasm, I could do more. Thinking of a regular
version of this, presumably called “Pod People”.

There are rivals for my time and affections: if one makes the right
offer, there might not be much left for you. You wouldn’t want that,
would you?

Still aiming at the Kwisatz Haderach, nootropics, and resisting the
current tide of crazy.

If you know of other people that might enjoy this blog, pass it on.
Especially if they are sustaining injuries from rolling around in a
vault full of doubloons and triploons: I’d be glad to help.
