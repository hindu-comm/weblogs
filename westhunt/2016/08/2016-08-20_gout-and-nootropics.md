Gout and Nootropics

Important drugs have often originated in some sort of ‘traditional
medicine” – witch doctors and such. Even Western medicine, the most
baroque and useless of ‘traditional medicines”, has occasionally yielded
a useful therapies. But maybe we should look at traditional diseases,
too. What if some disorder had a beneficial side effect – say, was some
kind of mental stimulant?

Many people have had the impression that gout had such an effect. It
seems to have a special fondness for men of consequence. Alexander the
Great apparently had it. “So did Ben Jonson, Talleyrand, Martin Luther,
John Wesley, Henry Fielding, Edward Gibbon, Thomas Gray, Stendhal, Sir
Isaac Newton, Samuel Johnson, the Pitts (father and son), William
Congreve, Francis Bacon, William Harvey, Lord Tennyson, Walter Savage
Landor, Charles Darwin, General Winfield Scott, Guy de Maupasssant, and
John Barrymore.” And Benjamin Franklin. Havelock Ellis, in A Study of
British Genius, said “There is … a pathological condition that occurs so
often, in such extreme forms, in men of such preeminent intellectual
ability, that it is impossible not to regard it as having a real
association with such ability.”

Of course they could all be wrong. But maybe someone should take a look…
