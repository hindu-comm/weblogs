Genetics and HR

You can think of a political ideology as a set of preferences – ” I Like
Candy!” – plus a theory of how things work – “lower marginal tax rates
will increase economic growth and technological progress”. Generally,
the self-destructiveness of the preferences and inaccuracy of the
world-theory associated with a particular ideology are limited by
natural selection.

As far as I know, no currently popular ideology acknowledges the results
of behavioral genetics, quantitative genetics, or psychometrics. To a
limited, inexact extent, some past worldviews did.

Often practitioners of popular ideologies explicitly reject established
results from those fields. They say things like “talent is distributed
evenly” – but of course that’s not true. They make plans based on such
falsehoods, plans that naturally fail, over and over and over again.

But practical people are also influenced by currently fashionable
ideologies – their worldview limits what ideas can be discussed or even
conceived of.

Obviously (you’d think) companies would like to hire effectively –
although you have to wonder if they really care, considering the
lackwits they employ in HR.

If they really cared, they would take a leaf from agricultural
geneticists. When evaluating a job candidate, don’t just use data on the
applicant – fold in data from close relatives. You’ll get a better
estimate.
