Timing the Wave

A recent [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/368.full) in PNAS
talks about ancient DNA results in Ireland. The story is getting to be a
familiar one: 5000 years ago Ireland was inhabited by a Sardinian-like
population, 4000 years ago by people pretty similar to the Irish today.
Looks like near-total replacement. Since the Corded Ware culture was in
place by 4900 years ago, we know that the replacement process in
northern Europe took less than 900 years, maybe a lot less. Ongoing
ancient DNA investigations should give us a pretty good chronology in
the next few years.

Some questions are going to be harder to answer. Why near-replacement in
northern Europe, but not in southern Europe? Obviously Indo-Europeans
imposed their languages, lots of Y-chromosomes, and made an autosomal
contribution to southern Europe, but it doesn’t look like replacement.
Sometimes these things boil down to choices, as when the Mongols started
taxing the southern Chinese rather pursuing extermination. Maybe a
prehistoric Yelü Chucai convinced the invaders that the EEF population
was good for something (pizza?), or on the other hand, maybe some of
those southern populations put up stronger resistance. Yet the G2a Y
chromosomes, once dominant, are very much reduced in number.
