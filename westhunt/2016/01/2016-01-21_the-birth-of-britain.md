The Birth of Britain

Recent studies considering modern and ancient DNA show that about 25-40%
of British ancestry is Anglo-Saxon, with a high in East Anglia and
gradual decreasing as you move north and west. While the Britons of
Roman times look like the Welsh.

Winston Churchill wrote about this, in *The Birth of Britain,* the first
installment of his history of the English-speaking peoples. He mentions
that place names in Sussex suggested total replacement, while the West
Saxon legal code made provision for the rights of Welshmen.. But he
didn’t know how much replacement had occurred. Still, he said “.. we may
cherish the hope that somewhere a maiden’s cry for pity, the appear of
beauty in distress, the lustful needs of an invading force,would create
some bond between victor and vanquished. Thus the blood would be
preserved, thus the rigours of subjugation would fade as generations
passed away. The complete obliteration of an entire race is repulsive to
the human mind. There should at least have been, in default of pity, a
hearing for practical advantage or the natural temptations of sex.”

However, being repulsive doesn’t stop something from happening. This
time, it didn’t. Perhaps Churchill’s ghost, or his ghost’s ghost, is
pleased by this result.
