When things changed

Once upon a time, I was arguing with some libertarians, who assuring me
that it was impossible to stop people from toking (for example), even if
we made sure that they could only obtain the ingredients by crawling
over the Himalayas after they had been covered with broken glass. At the
same time they were quite sure that you could move mountains via
medium-sized changes in the marginal tax rate.

But… I’m pretty sure that in my home town, the fraction taking anything
interesting other than alcohol was zero in 1955, 1944, 1925, 1900, 1850…
With the possible exceptions of some guys taking opiates after the Civil
War because their stump hurt. Many people back-project: they’re sure
that any vice common today had to be just as common back in the days of
yore. Yet they’re wrong.

In the same way, I have seen people saying that probably there was lots
more false paternity back when people were poorer and less educated, say
in 1890. Yet we know from Y-chromosome studies that did not happen.

Sometimes things change. As far as drugs other than alcohol, people
didn’t use them much \[recreationally\] for most of the history of the
Western world. Of course some hadn’t been invented, but from every bit
of evidence I have, the Greeks and the Romans, the Elizabethans and the
Founders and Victorians – just didn’t spend much time getting baked.
Drunk, sure.

In 1964, there was an inflection point for this and many other things.
