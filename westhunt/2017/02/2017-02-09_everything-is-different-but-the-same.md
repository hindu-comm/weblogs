Everything is different, but the same

Another new [paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/05/106062)
finds that the GWAS hits for IQ – largely determined in Europeans –
don’t work in people of African descent. That was always a possibility:
I’ve talked about it. If you look at the frequencies of height alleles
(determined from GWAS in Europeans) you would predict that Pygmies are
pretty short – but they’re considerably shorter than that. They have
their own private alleles influencing height, which make them even
shorter than you would think. Or, if you tried to estimate skin color in
Koreans by the frequencies of variants that cause light skin in
Europeans, you would conclude that they were black as night – but
they’re not. They’re pretty light-skinned, but that’s caused by
light-skin alleles common in East Asia, almost completely disjoint from
the common light-skin alleles in Europeans.

So you can’t use those GWAS hits to tell how smart sub-Saharan Africans
are, at least not today. All you can use are IQ measurements and
achievements. It is as if the only way we could determine your height
was by using a ruler, instead of GWAS predictions.
