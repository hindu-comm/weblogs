No Child Left Behind

Some time ago, around the time hat Congress passed No Child Left Behind,
a reporter asked me what I thought its effect would be. I said I didn’t
think it would have any.

Judging from the NAEP long-term trend scores for 17-year olds, I was
right. They have hardly changed in more than 40 years. Naturally that’s
what you would want to look at, rather than the scores for 4th graders
or 8th graders. If they go up while graduates stagnate, it doesn’t
matter. Only an idiot could get excited over that kind of sterile
improvement – but since nearly everyone involved with this question *is*
an idiot, they go on and on about it.

Reminds me of the way in which the Soviets kept increasing the
production of steel, rather than steel products…
