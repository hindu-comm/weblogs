The Great Filter

Let us imagine that we found out that nervous systems had evolved twice
(which seems to be the case). And suppose that you spent a lot of time
worrying about the Fermi Paradox – and had previously thought that
nervous system evolution was the unlikely event that explains the great
silence, the bottleneck that explained why we don’t see signs of alien
intelligent life. Thus in our past: we’re safe. Now you’re worried:
maybe the Great Filter lies in our future, and the End approaches. But
not just that: you assume that the political class noticed this too, and
will start neglecting the future (cough, cough) because they too believe
that isn’t going to be one.  
Worrying about the Great Filter might not be crazy, but assuming that
politicians are hep to such things and worry about them is. If you think
that, you have less common sense than a monotreme. And that’s real
common. I’ve had analogous arguments with people: they didn’t have any
common sense either.
