Torsion Dystonia

There’s a mutation found in Ashkenazi Jews (not common – maybe 1 in 2000
frequency) that, in the opinion of a number of a number of those that
have dealt with patients, makes you smarter. It’s a low-penetrance
dominant. Some people never have trouble with it, some have moderate
trouble (writer’s cramp), some end up with crippling muscle spasms. A
friend of a friend has it – just writer’s cramp – but her neurologist
comforted her a bit by pointing out that “it makes you smart”.

You’d think that people would be super-interested in this – but they’re
not. I talked to a guy who, years ago, stumbled onto torsion dystonia at
NIH and was quite excited, but nobody else here wanted to investigate
it. Too interesting, probably.

Do I think that higher-than-average Jewish IQ is mediated by single-gene
effects like this? Probably not most of it – probably the main thing is
slightly higher frequencies of the kind of IQ-plus variants we’re
getting from GWAS studies. Maybe some of it – some of the mutations
causing relatively common Ashkenazi genetic diseases ( like Tay-Sachs
and Gaucher’s disease) sure have unusual neurological effects.

Like anything that hurts children, it’s hard to read about. For
