Animals and Women : Feminist Theoretical Explorations

An interesting book was published a few years back, and reviewed in the
Times Literary Supplement. The book is “Animals and Women: Feminist
Theoretical Explorations”, edited by Carol J. Adams and Josephine
Donovan. The authors say, in their introduction:

“We believe that feminism is transformative philosophy that embraces the
amelioration of life on earth for all life-forms, for all natural
entities. We believe that all oppressions are interconnected: no one
creature will be free until all are free – from abuse, degradation,
exploitation, pollution, and commercialization. Women and animals have
shared these oppressions historically, and until the mentality of
domination is ended in all its forms, these afflictions will continue.”

The best chapter is surely the one by Karen Davies: “Thinking Like a
Chicken: Farm Animals and the Feminine Connection”.

I quote:

“Often after one of her ordeals, in which her legs would get caught in
her wings, causing her terrible confusion and distress, I would sit
talking to her, stroking her beautiful back and her feet that were so
soft between the toes and on the bottoms, and she would carry on the
dialogue with me, her tail feathers twitching in a kind of unison with
each of her utterances.”
