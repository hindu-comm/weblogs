The Index

It would be helpful if some guy would post a list of all the true things
you’re not allowed to say. With localized versions: specific things you
can’t say at company X, say McDonald’s or Google. I’ve seem people from
other cultures slip up on this, and it hardly seems fair. Whoever wrote
down the list would of course be immediately fired, but surely someone
is willing to suffer for the greater good.
