I will reread and review Jared Diamond’s book Guns, Germs, and Steel

If the price is right. Running a GoFundME for $1000. Paypal and bitcoin
are also acceptable.

The idea is not to joyfully take out the trash, as I did with Cordelia
Fine’s *Testosterone Rex*, but to answer a book that is fundamentally
wrong without being utter dreck.

Here’s the [link](https://www.gofundme.com/review-guns-germs-and-steel).

Then again, since GoFundMe has just suspended my account, maybe not.

Now it’s up again. So go ahead.

Paypal also works: use the Donate button.
