Regional change

Jared Diamond thinks that people in different parts of the world can and
have evolved in different directions, depending on local selective
pressures. He thinks that people in Eurasia and Africa evolved
resistance to various crowd and tropical diseases, and that people that
were not exposed to those infectious diseases – such as Amerindians and
Polynesians – were very vulnerable to them. He thinks that that
vulnerability played a part in European conquest of the Americas. All of
which is correct: we know some of the genetic basis of those differences
in susceptibility. I doubt if if he would argue against recent work that
shows regional adaptation to cold and high altitude.

He also thinks that regionally different selective forces could and
probably have caused average differences in intelligence of different
groups. He does not think that everybody must be the same – does not
think that evolution stops at the neck.

However, he believes that there is some principle that ensures that the
intelligence differences created by those regionally varying selective
pressures are the opposite of what current measurements show.
