Slush Fund

I’m thinking of reviewing some books that are not hilariously stupid: I
can’t promise that my review will make you laugh. I’m looking for some
money for book-buying – probably ebooks, because that’s faster and
doesn’t threaten to collapse my house. Paypal or bitcoin works, but I’ve
been hankering for a few Maria Theresa thalers.
