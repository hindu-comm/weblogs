African variation

Generally, sub-Saharan Africans have low scores on IQ tests, educational
assessment tests like PISA, etc.

Does that mean that all Africans are the same? No. Could some population
in Africa do considerably better, say more like Europeans or East
Asians?

Sure: there’s no law of physics that would make it impossible. If local
selection pushed in that direction, it could happen.

Has it happened? Maybe on a sub-national,tribal scale. Not on a national
scale: every country in sub-Saharan Africa does poorly.

Occasionally I hear people talk about Africa’s great genetic variety. It
exists: the genetic difference between Bushmen and Bantu is bigger than
the difference between Bantu and Finns. A couple of thousand years ago,
before the Bantu had arrived in South Africa & mixed with the Bushmen,
it was even bigger: looking at ancient DNA from those unmixed Bushmen,
looks as if they split off from the rest of the human race at least a
quarter of a million years ago. Well before anything that looks like
behavioral modernity, by any definition. Half as divergent as
Neanderthals.

But the most divergent populations are small. There are fewer than
100,000 Bushmen, on the order of a million Pygmies, around 1000 Hadza.
Most people in Africa are Bantu or related populations: next after that
are Nilotic peoples.
