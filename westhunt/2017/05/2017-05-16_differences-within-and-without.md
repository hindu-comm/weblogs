Differences, within and without

Suppose that the narrow-sense heritability of IQ is 0.7 \[ in typical
western circumstances: no ball-peen hammers), and the non-genetic
variation is almost all caused by mysterious unshared-environment
effects – not the school you go to or the books in the house, but
something essentially random, like somatic mutation, or randomness in
development.

Then while a big fraction of variance in IQ is caused by genetic
differences, quite a bit is not.

But now look at the difference between two groups. It’s entirely
possible that those random forces – somatic mutation, noise in
development, etc – are close to the same in both groups.

If so, the difference in the *averages* of the two groups would be
almost entirely genetic, since the non-genetic factors would average
out.
