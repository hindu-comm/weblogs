The Big Picture

Once upon a time, I wrote a long spiel on life extension – before it was
cool, apparently. I sent it off to an interested friend \[a science
fiction editor\] who was at that time collaborating on a book with a
certain politician. That politician – Speaker of the House, but that
could be anyone of thousands of guys, right? – ran into my spiel and
read it. His immediate reaction was that greatly extending the healthy
human life span would be horrible – it would bankrupt Social Security !
Nice to know that guys running the show always have the big picture in
mind.

Reminds me of a sf story \[Trouble with Lichens\] in which something of
that sort is invented and denounced by the British trade unions, as a
plot to keep them working forever & never retire.
