W. Tecumseh Fitch

I have occasionally seen work by W. Tecumseh Fitch, but I just learned
two important things about him:

A. He’s Sherman’s great-great-great-grandson, and

B. He put a Chinese alligator on
[heliox](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/15/2442). We’ve all
wondered about that, but he actually d*id* it.
