Dweck as in Wreck

Carol Dweck has won a juicy prize for work on ‘growth mindset’ – the
notion that belief that your intelligence is a fixed trait cripples you,
while a ‘growth mindset’ allows progress.

Her studies do not replicate, of course, because this idea is false.
It’s obvious bullshit. As it turns out, ants *can’t* move rubber tree
plants.

What do ‘grit’, ‘growth mindset’, ‘power posing’, ‘priming’, and
‘stereotype threat’ have in common? As far as I can tell, the more
obvious the bullshit, the better the Fools at the Top like it.
