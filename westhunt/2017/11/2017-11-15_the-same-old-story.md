The Same Old Story

People often reinterpret past events, recast them in terms of some
contemporary ideology. When historians talk about the Monophysites in
Byzantine times, they often suggest that those struggle are a mask for a
kind of proto-nationalism. Maybe they were: and maybe nobody involved
was thinking anything remotely like that. The Communists tried to come
up with Marxist interpretations of ancient history, which led them to
spend way too much time talking about
[Mazdakites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdak) in Sassanian Persia
and the [Zealots of
Thessalonika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealots_of_Thessalonica) .
And [Spartacus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u93bhAimFFU): but at
least Spartacus was cool.

Then there are feminist versions of history. Let us never speak of them
again.

Generally, this is all crap. But we could at least hope for something
new along these lines: bullshit perhaps, but at least *fresh* bullshit.
Obviously  
the reality underlying both the Punic Wars and the Crusades is the
ancient struggle between EEF and ANE.
