The effectiveness of unreasonable physicists

Now and then physicists have invaded other fields with success,
sometimes embarrassing the natives. For example, Max Delbruck and the
phage group, Crick and DNA, Seymour Benzer, Walter Gilbert, Alvarez and
the K-T extinction, etc.

But sometimes it doesn’t turn out so well. I remember a physicist who
thought he had invented the perfect weight-loss diet: you drank lots of
cold water, which require lots of calories to warm up, and thus you
would lose weight. Problem was, he hadn’t noticed that there is a
differences between gram calories (the amount of energy required to
raise the temperature of one *gram* of water by one degree C) and food
calories, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one
*kilogram* of water by one degree.

His diet worked, but you had to drink a thousand times more cold water
than in his original estimate, which made for an inordinate number of
pit stops.
