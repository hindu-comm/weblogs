There was a rumor, about a tumor, nestled at the base of his brain

Jacob Sullum, in Reason, says that there’s no chance that a detailed
pathological study of Stephen Paddock’s brain will explain why Paddock
committed mass murder.

He quotes Szasz. A mistake.

Sullum’s claim is incorrect. Now and then we manage to recognize a
pathology that underlies someone’s crazy. Once in a while we even
understand it. I’m not saying that the odds of finding an explanation of
this atrocity in an autopsy ( in our current state of knowledge) are
good: they’re not. But sometimes it works.

Strokes, lesions, trauma, infection, cancer, circulatory disorders,
firing a steel rod through your head – all can make people act even
screwier.
