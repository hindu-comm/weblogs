selective immigration

Some cases involve stronger selection than I would have guessed.
Nigerian male immigrants to [Great Britain,
1980-2010](http://doku.iab.de/daten/brain-drain/):

low, medium, and high level of education: ” We distinguish three levels
of education: primary (low skilled: includes lower secondary, primary
and no schooling); secondary (medium-skilled: high-school leaving
certificate or equivalent) and tertiary education (high-skilled: higher
than high-school leaving certificate or equivalent).”

1980 3204 6926 1942  
1985 4435 4606 4953

1990 5796 2484 7885

1995 7142 2132 3528

2000 8650 2484 22324

2005 7869 2540 26608

2010 9326 3406 42106

Nigeria graduates about 150,000 people a year, so something like 2% of
modern Nigerians graduate from college.



P.S. Suppose you only took the top few percent from a population with a
low average: you might end up with a mean IQ of 100, but there would be
a funny distribution. Not much of a right tail.
