Genetic Canalization

“Canalization is the reduced sensitivity of a phenotype to changes or
perturbations in the underlying genetic and nongenetic factors that
determine its expression. ”

as long as environmental ( or genetic) perturbations aren’t too large,
they have little effect.

Makes sense: developmental sloppiness would generally reduce fitness.

This varies with particular traits: under various kinds of stress, you
would expect natural selection to particularly favor canalization of
traits that are important to fitness. Maybe intelligence is more
important to fitness than height?

Shared environment generally has little effect on adult intelligence.
Canalization? Or consider Stuart Ritchie’s work suggesting that extra
years of school increases intelligence: considering canalization, I
doubt it.

Educational experts naturally consider canalization when considering new
educational interventions. That’s a joke, son.
