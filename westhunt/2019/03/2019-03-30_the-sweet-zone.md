The Sweet Zone

You can think of the habitable zone as a region in a multidimensional
parameter space on which members of a species do well enough to persist.
Move them slowly towards the edge of the zone and they often adapt.
Move them too fast and they can’t, move them too far and they can’t.

Generally speaking, fitness declines as the environment gets farther
from the one they’re adapted to. But there is an important class of
exceptions to this generalization.

Describe it.
