An American Dilemma

Today we’re seeing clear
[evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0757-5) of genetic
differences between classes: causal differences. People with higher
socioeconomic status have ( on average) higher EA polygenic scores.
Higher scores for cognitive ability, as well. This is of course what
every IQ test has shown for many decades.

It’s driving regional migration in the UK: people with higher scores in
depressed areas (like mining towns) are leaving for London, leaving
those towns even more depressed.

There is ongoing decline in those polygenic scores, as observed in other
studies and as predicted by demographers and [science-fiction
writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marching_Morons)s many years
ago.

So we have classes that are genetically different, with upper classes
genetically smarter. Could we have populations or ethnic groups that
were genetically smarter? Obviously: simply create one by dropping a
bunch of high-SES ( or high-scoring) people on a deserted island. Do
we already have such populations? ( although, if I’m not mistaken, that
would be racist.)

Well, sometimes a group has high scores, high ability because it is a
far-from-random sample, while not being particularly genetically
distinct or separate. ( either today or in the past). College
professors are smarter than average, at least in fields like math and
natural science, but they are drawn from many populations and do not
marry entirely or primarily within their group. In fact they hardly
breed at all, nowadays. Los Alamos High has the highest test scores in
New Mexico: that’s an unrepresentative sample.

Nigerians in the UK seem to be a very non-random sample, highly
selected: most of them have at least some college while maybe 5% of the
general population in Nigeria does. I was was somewhat surprised to see
this: most of the migrations I’m more familiar with (mostly US major
immigration streams) are not so unrepresentative. Of course if they
stayed in the UK and almost entirely married among themselves, they’d
*be* a new, smarter-than Nigerian ethnic group. But that, too, would be
racist.

Let’s look at Ashkenazi Jews in the United States. They’re very
successful, averaging upper-middle-class.So you’d think that they
must have high polygenic scores for EA (and they do).

Were they a highly selected group? No: most were from Eastern Europe.
“Immigration of
Eastern[Yiddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish "Yiddish")-speaking[Ashkenazi
Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews "Ashkenazi Jews"), in
1880–1914, brought a large, poor, traditional element to[New York
City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). They
were[Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism "Orthodox Judaism")or[Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Judaism "Conservative Judaism")in
religion. They founded
the[Zionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") movement
in the United States, and were active supporters of the Socialist party
and labor unions. Economically, they concentrated in the garment
industry.”

And there were a lot of them: it’s harder for a sample to be very
unrepresentative when it makes up a big fraction of the entire
population.

But that can’t be: that would mean that Europeans Jews were just smarter
than average. And that would be racist.

Could it be result of some kind of favoritism? Obviously not, because
that would be anti-Semitic.
