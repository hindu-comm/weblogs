Mars Direct

Trump was baiting Nasa’s head, asking why we couldn’t go directly to
Mars instead of puttering around on the Moon first, bringing in Michael
Collins and Buzz Aldrin on the subject.

Trump’s right: assuming that you want to send a manned mission to Mars,
Mars Direct is the most logical ( and cheapest) way. NASA is
bullshitting us. Nice seeing the reporters demonstrate their
incomplete knowledge of Hohmann orbits: but they must know more about
other things. Some other thing.

It is possible to imagine a real economic payoff for a Mars mission (I
was called a person of broad imagination at the ISIR conference) but
harder to see why you’d need men there.
