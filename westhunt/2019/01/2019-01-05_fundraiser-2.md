Fundraiser

It’s that time again, time to contribute. You can send funds via Paypal,
or by check. If you want deductibility, or have something complicated in
mind, write to me at gcochran9@comcast.net. I’ll be reviewing books,
talking about this and that, abusing reporters, and working on a weird
startup ( details to follow). Consulting work on algorithm development,
GPU programming, miscellaneous software, and estimating your date’s
breeding value is welcome.

You can also send bitcoins, to 1Jv4cu1wETM5Xs9unjKbDbCrRF2mrjWXr5 .
