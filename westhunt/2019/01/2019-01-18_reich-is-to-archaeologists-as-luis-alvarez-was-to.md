Reich is to archaeologists as Luis Alvarez was to

Paleontologists. A lot of parallels. I read a number of books on the
asteroid-extinction theory and the controversy around it, including
several by paleontologists. I was not impressed by them. Although, to
be fair, I donâ€™t remember the paleontologists accusing Luis Alvarez of
racism.

Other examples of this pattern?
