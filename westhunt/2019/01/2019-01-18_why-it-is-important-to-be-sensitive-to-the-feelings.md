Why it is important to be sensitive to the feelings

Of indigenous people, when doing archaeology or work on ancient DNA.
Because sometimes they’re in a position to stop you. But shouldn’t you
really, really care about hurting their feelings, when you find that
they didn’t emerge from a giant peach or whatever?

I can’t see why.

Tell the truth.
