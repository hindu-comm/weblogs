If you can’t be a good example: Venezuela

then you’ll just have to serve as a horrible warning. Since people are
attracted by stupid ideas like moths to a flame, it may be that leaving
certain flaming piles of shit around for all to see would maximize
global human welfare. That’s rough on Venezuela, though. There are
probably countries that could do a better job of scaring sense into
people: ideally a smaller but hard to ignore country, one that can make
the point without injuring so many people and tying up such large
heavy-oil reserves.

North Korea has a lock on neutering the natural appeal of dynastic
Juche-Stalinism. Cuba does a fairly good job with white-bread
Communism. But we obviously need more examples: we need a feminist
homeland, with a constant flow of advocates making aliyah, to keep the
population from collapsing. Ideally with very few guys, just enough to
open pickle jars and keep basic infrastructure running.
