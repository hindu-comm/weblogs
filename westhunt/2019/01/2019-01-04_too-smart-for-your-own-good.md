Too smart for your own good

Thinking aloud about engineering intelligence, again. There are two
categories of alleles that affect intelligence: near-neutral SNPs that
boost or decrease IQ, the things that make up the PRS score, and genetic
load – uncommon, unfavorable mutations which everyone has some of.

Generally someone who is unusually intelligent has both
more-than-average + PRS-type alleles and fewer-than-average unfavorable
mutations. Having less genetic load is probably good in many ways ( up
to a point). Having fewer unfavorable mutations (‘systems integrity’)
may explain the longevity advantage we see.

If you have lots more PRS-type + alleles than average, you are probably
going to do worse in some other traits. Neutral means there must be
disadvantages associated with the advantages.

If you have enough PRS-type plus alleles and sufficiently few
deleterious mutations, are way out on the curve, you’re going to end up
with a phenotype that’s seldom or never been seen before, and has
essentially never been tested by natural selection. Almost certainly
something will go wrong. Same is true for height, although in that case
we understand the failure modes better ( square-cube law, if nothing
else).

Question: are some existing people already far enough out on the curve
to begin to show signs of such problems?
