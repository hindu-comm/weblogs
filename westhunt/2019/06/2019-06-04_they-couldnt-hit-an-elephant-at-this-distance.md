“They couldn’t hit an elephant at this distance.”

Allen Guelzo wrote a book about the battle of Gettysburg “Gettysburg:
The Last Invasion” , in which he says some confused things about
smoothbores and rifles. One of my regular readers noticed and mentioned
this some time ago.

“Rifling bestowed greater range and accuracy on a musket, but it did so
at the price of forming a trajectory for the bullet which “dropped”
rather than went straight to a target. To hit a target thus required
exact knowledge of the speed and distance of a target, something which
in battle was rarely available.”

Which has left Wiki thinking that rifle bullets had curvy paths while
musket balls flew straight. Not so!

[Here’s](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/difference-between-musket-and-rifle-trajectories.915555/)
a decent discussion ( by RogueOne). The key point is that a
spin-stabilized bullet can be pointy yet not tumble: so it has a smaller
cross-section and experiences less wind resistance. So it goes
**farther**.

All the time that the bullet is flying, it’s dropping, under gravity.
If it goes twice as far as a musket ball, that takes twice as long – and
it drops four times as far. D = 1/2 g t^2 – one of the secrets of the
Occident, known to but a few.

Guelzo suggests that people couldn’t really take advantage of the
rifle’s greater range: but they could. The Springfield was sighted for
100, 300, and 500 yards – and when 15,0o0 Rebels are coming at you, you
have a decent chance of hitting *somebody* at the greater distances
possible with a rifle. Well-trained sharpshooters could even be decently
accurate at those ranges, as Sedgwick found.

Charges didn’t work as well as they had with muskets.

Modern rifles have considerably higher muzzle velocities. Assume that
one has four times the muzzle velocity of an 1861 Springfield: then it
will take 1/4 the time to reach the same target, and will drop 1/16th as
far. A flatter trajectory. How do we do it? Velocity !
