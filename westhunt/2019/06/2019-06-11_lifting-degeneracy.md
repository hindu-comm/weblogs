Lifting degeneracy

Some time ago I discussed the idea that Neanderthals were fucked-up
because their low effective population size led to inefficient purifying
selection. But the usual harmonic-mean effective population size is not
quite right: for salvage mutations, things that somewhat correct the
wrongness caused by increased genetic load, the effective population
size is closer to the average. In other words, there were probably a
lot more Neanderthals during interglacial periods, and these genetic
consequences of those population booms ameliorated their genetic
problems.

Second, Neanderthal Y chromosomes and mtdNA have even smaller effective
population sizes, 1/4th as big as the autosomal effective size, and thus
were even more likely to be messed up. which is why, maybe the
Neanderthals seem to have picked up mtDNA from some African group closer
to modern humans around a quarter of a million years ago: they needed
it.
