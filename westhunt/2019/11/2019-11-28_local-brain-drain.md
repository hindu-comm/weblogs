Local brain drain

Abdel Abdellaoui and colleagues recent put out a
[paper](https://t.co/TUMiOkasD9?amp=1) on genetics and social
stratification in Great Britain. Among other things, they found that
polygenic scores of educational attainment were lower in seriously
economically depressed areas, such as coal mining towns – and that this
depression has increased with time. The smarter people are going where
the better paying jobs are.

Surely the same thing has been happening in West Virginia.

This happens all the time, on small scales and large scales. The effect
is stronger at the edges of the distribution – the per-capita number
number of National Merit finalists can vary a lot due to such factors.
Some places suffer a brain drain, others a concentration. Note that
this effect happens even among a single ethnic group. So you see a
surprisingly large number of National Merit scholars at Los Alamos High
School or Oak Ridge High School – or Cocoa Beach, back during the Apollo
project. The effect shows up in university towns, in particular
neighborhoods of cities where people with higher average smarts cluster,
etc.

This is all obvious, and everybody has seen it. But if you are a real
anti-hereditarian, every example has to be explained by some
environmental advantage ( none of which we can find). Los Alamos and
Oak Ridge must be secretly bathing the kids in N-rays, while the meals
served to the kids in the Chicago Public School system must be enriched
with lead.

To a true anti-hereditarian, every day is fresh & new & surprising,
because hardly anything happens as they expect.
