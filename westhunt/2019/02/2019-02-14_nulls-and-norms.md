Nulls and Norms

The neutral theory of evolution assumes that allele frequencies change
stochastically: population sizes over time matter, but there’s nothing
special about any particular allele. All chance. It can be used to
develop evidence for selection: if you see results that are very
different from those predicted by the neutral model, you may have a good
case that some allele or alleles have been favored by natural
selection. The null model assumes zero selection.

It sound ridiculous \[ and is ridiculous\] , but a lot of people took
this null model to be the surprise-free model, that pattern of events
that happens most of the time, like sunny days in the Atacama Desert.
Not just for a single noncoding allele, but for  adaptation in
general !

I remember Svante Paabo making a similar mistake: he thought that
probably none of the Neanderthal alleles we picked up were adaptive: the
odds were against any particular archaic allele being adaptive, but it
was almost certain that *some* would be , for example ones that
protected against regional diseases.

Move a species into a new environment, one that is survivable but
noticeably different from where it originated. What’s the probability
of significant adaptive change? 100% !

One of the more amusing aspects of this weird confusion was that
believing that nothing in biology made any sense was a mark of
sophistication: adaptationists were rubes. Country boys like Bill
Hamilton or George Williams.

Theories in which the surprise-free prediction is something that has
never, ever happened are fairly common in the softer sciences.
