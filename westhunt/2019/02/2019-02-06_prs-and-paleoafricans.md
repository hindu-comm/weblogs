PRS and Paleoafricans

PRS scores for various traits, determined in Europeans, don’t work well
for sub-Saharan Africans, due to big differences in population history.
That can in principle be fixed by doing GWAS studies among Africans.
But PRS scores determined in either Eurasians or Bantu surely won’t work
with Bushmen, probably the most divergent human population. And I can’t
see how we fix this, because there aren’t enough Bushmen in the world to
even do one of the required large-sample GWAS studies.
