Chasing Amy

Amy Harmon keeps making mistakes. Right now she thinks that the math
establishment must be out to get black mathematicians, since there so
few of them. But with an IQ gap, the fraction of a low-scoring group
that scores over a high threshold will be significantly lower than the
fraction of an IQ-100 group that does so. As you raise the threshold,
this disparity becomes larger and larger. While the threshold IQ for
being a professional mathematician is about as high as it gets for any
profession. Even higher than the threshold IQ for being a reporter.

To be fair, not many people to seem to understand this point. I talked
about it some time ago,
[here](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/outliers/).

Reminds me of the school where the math faculty was hiring Argentine
Jews to satisfy their Hispanic quota.
