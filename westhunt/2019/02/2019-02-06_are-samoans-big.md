Are Samoans Big?

More to the point, are they *inherently* big? Genetically big? We used
to know that Samoans were big. But today it is possible, in principle
to develop a more detailed, genetical, causal explanation of Samoan
bigness – although we haven’t really done so yet. And since that better
explanation is possible and desirable, yet has not yet been developed,
somehow we no longer know whether Samoans are inherently really big. The
best is the enemy of the good. It could be some kind of optical
illusion. Maybe bigness is a polygenic trait, which would have taken a
million years to select for, just as it took a million years to develop
the German Shepherd or shrink dachshunds by 50%. Maybe that bigness is
unstable because polygenic, in the same way that Percherons get small if
you let them watch too much vintage Steve Martin.

Now it might be that Samoans are big in every known environment, but
that only shows how powerful and universal prejudice really is. It might
be that we have spent hundreds of billions on attempts to shrink
Samoans, without any lasting result, but that only shows that we haven’t
tried hard enough.

If we had a PRS for bigness, and it showed that Samoans had
significantly higher scores – well, that would be a scientific
travesty. One that was especially apparent to anyone that had just
gotten their Ph.D. in a related controversial field and was looking for
an academic job.
