LINEs, SINEs, and Sundaland

Maybe ten years ago, Henry was analyzing some retrotransposons,
sequences that randomly make and insert more copies of themselves. These
mutations are statistically simpler in some ways that nucleotide
substitutions: insertions are unique.

Henry had gotten some sign reversed while I was distracting him, so for
a moment it looked as if modern humans had originated in Southeast Asia,
instead of Africa or nearby. So the new task was to come up with a
scenario that might explain that. I was in a silly mood, which helped:
took me about a minute to suggest that some of the Indonesian islands
and their neighbors went back and forth between between being accessible
during deep glacial maxima ( low sea levels, Indonesian archipelago
turns into Sundaland) and separated most of the rest of the time:
allowing for occasional colonization by archaic sapiens, isolation and
local adaptation, maybe even speciation.

Since then we’ve found signs of Denisovan admixture in people in
Melanesians ( PNG, Australia, the Solomons), hobbits on Flores, other
little guys in the Philippines, and old tools in Sulawesi. Very likely
we’re going to find Sulawesi man. I wouldn’t be surprised to see five
or more separate archaic pops in those islands. Maybe derived erectus,
maybe something earlier, maybe highly differentiated Denisovans, maybe
all of the above and a few dark elves. I still don’t think they made to
Australia, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it.

While it looks as if Neanderthals made it to Crete.

Since there were land bridges to Japan in glacial maxima, you’d have to
to suspect that they had their own local archaic populations as well.
To a decent approximation, if elephants could colonize a place, so could
archaic humans.
