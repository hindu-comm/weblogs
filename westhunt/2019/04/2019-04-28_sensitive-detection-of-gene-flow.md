Sensitive Detection of gene flow

One problem with arguing with ignorant people is that they don’t usually
have indicator lights that tell you exactly how ignorant they are. This
matters when you’re trying to explain something: it’s not always clear
how much goes without saying.

About the imaginary high levels of gene flow between distant populations
in the past: if that had happened, Fst between those populations would
be close to zero. It’s not. And when an inevitable consequence of a
certain proposition is false, the proposition is false.

But here’s another example: falciparum malaria probably originated in
Africa ( it’s closely related to a kind of malaria that infects
gorillas). At some point it spread to humans, and it’s a bear – in terms
of evolutionary pressures, probably the worst disease in the world.

Many different expensive genetic defenses have arisen in populations
exposed to malaria. But those seen in southeast Asia/PNG are, at the
molecular level, entirely different from the ones seen in Africa. As
far as I know, there is no overlap at all. You see mutations of the same
gene showing up in those far-separated populations ( convergence) , but
the SNPs are never the same.

The sickle-cell allele would have been advantageous in, say, PNG
lowlands, and if even a few copies had ever arrived there, it would have
become common rather rapidly. A smidgen of gene flow from sub-Saharan
africa , even 20 individuals total, would have left a genetic signature
in PNG. \[ just as a few copies of Denisovan altitude-tolerance alleles
were enough to transform Tibetans\] That smidgen would have grown
geometrically with time: it would function as a very sensitive detector
of African gene flow. But it never happened. Contrariwise, some of the
malaria defenses in PNG ( like Melanesian ovalcytosis) would have
spread widely in Africa with even a little gene flow. But that never
happened either.
