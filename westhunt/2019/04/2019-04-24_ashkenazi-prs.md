Ashkenazi PRS

There are now a couple of surveys with Ashkenazi EA polygenic scores.
We don’t know that the populations were representative, but probably
they weren’t far off. Scores correspond to an IQ of about 110.
Personally, I’m still pulling for 112.

A fair number of people publicly disagreed with our Ashkenazi
hypothesis.

They were wrong.
