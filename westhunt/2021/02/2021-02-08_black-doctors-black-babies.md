Black Doctors, Black Babies

There’s a [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/35/21194) out
claiming that black infant infant mortality is much higher when they’re
treated by white doctors, rather than black doctors.

Could it be that MCAT scores have negative predictive value?

No, there’s a simpler explanation: the report is nonsense. A
metaphorical cee-gar to the first person to explain why.

And the next question is: why do the pinheads that authored this paper
have jobs?
