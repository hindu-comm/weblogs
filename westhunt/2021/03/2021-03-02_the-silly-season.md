The Silly Season

[Inside a Battle Over Race, Class and Power at Smith
College](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/us/smith-college-race.html#click=https://t.co/lbc2LgrTKi)

In midsummer of 2018, Oumou Kanoute, a Black student at Smith College,
recounted a distressing American tale:  
She was eating lunch in a dorm lounge when a janitor and a campus police
officer walked over and asked her what she was doing there.

The officer, who could have been carrying a “lethal weapon,” left her
near “meltdown,” Ms. Kanoute wrote on Facebook, saying that this
encounter continued a yearlong pattern of harassment at Smith.

Ms. Kanoute was determined to have eaten in a deserted dorm that had
been closed for the summer; the janitor had been encouraged to notify
security if he saw unauthorized people there. The officer, like all
campus police, was unarmed. ”

Here, in what is likely the sign of some internal power struggle, the
NYTimes is actually dissing some young moron who thinks that all the
janitors of the world are out to get her, rather than honoring her lived
experience

But there is a deeper significance: this must be the most boring story
ever told. When I was bitten by a spider in my back yard and alternated
between agony and a strange crisp energy, that was more interesting.
When ants came over the wall from next door (where the lady lived who
once worked on the Manhattan Project) and kidnapped our ants, that was
more interesting. When my youngest boy tried to crawl through the fence
to the condo behind us and got his punkin head stuck, \_that\_ was more
interesting.

When my Dad’s sister won the golf tournament at the country club but was
denied the prize because she wasn’t a guy, followed by my uncle Dean’s
protest (crapping in every hole in the golf course just before he went
off to the Army) – that too was more interesting.

I would imagine that many of my readers have had experiences ( possibly
in the last half hour) even more worthy of coverage in the Paper of
Record than Ms. Kanoute’s.
