There’s good eating on one of those

Recently, Y.-H. Percival Zhang and colleagues demonstrated a method of
converting cellulose into starch and glucose. Zhang thinks that it can
be scaled up into an effective industrial process, one that could
produce a thousand calories of starch for less than a dollar from
cellulosic waste. This would be a good thing. It’s not just that are 7
billion people – the problem is that we have hardly any food reserves
(about 74 days at last report). The usual assumption is that any drought
or blight would be local, but that isn’t necessarily so. We might have
another Tambora-style eruption, or an asteroid big enough to generate
tidal waves and kick up a lot of dust – or wheat rust might get [out of
control](http://www.amazon.com/No-Blade-Grass-John-Christopher/dp/0380003198).

If this works, we might have a reserve in hand. At least until the
population runs up to the new Malthusian limit.
