Beneath Low-Hanging Fruit

In yet another example of long-delayed discovery, it turns out that you
can treat a number of filarial diseases, such as
[elephantiasis](http://diseasespictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Elephantiasis-9.jpg)
or
[onchocerciasis](http://www.hxbenefit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Onchocerciasis-Picture.jpg)
(river blindness) with tetracycline or doxycycline.

Heedless of the evolutionary imperative to do no unnecessary harm, these
parasitic worms cause all kinds of trouble, some of it by a surprising
mechanism. They carry *Wolbachia*, a symbiotic bacteria, and it seems
*Wolbachia* proteins are responsible for most of the inflammatory
damage, through an endotoxin-like activity. By the way,
*[Wolbachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolbachia)* is the Chickenman
of parasites and extremely interesting in itself.

Antibiotic treatment sterilizes filiarial nematodes, inhibits larval
development, and reduces viability of adult worms. I will bet any amount
of money that poorly educated doctors (drunken remittance men, etc) in
Africa had good results (by accident) using tetracycline on people with
filarial disease as far back as the 1950s. It must have happened again
and again and again – and since few of those doctors ever went to
Harvard, I’ll bet some of them noticed it. There is a good chance that
one or two of them actually tried to write up their results, but of
course no journal would publish that kind of nonsense.
