DX-ing

I was looking at the blog stats, and although our readers are widely
distributed (179 countries and statelets) , there are nations we haven’t
heard from. So, if any of you get the chance, pass the good word on to
South Sudan and San Marino. And I have to wonder why we’re getting so
many hits from Laos and the Faroe Islands.
