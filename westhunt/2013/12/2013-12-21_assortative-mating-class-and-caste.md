Assortative Mating, Class, and Caste

I have an old blog post
[here](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/class-caste-and-genes/)
about assortative mating and how it can mimic very strong selection.
Greg and I are just finishing a manuscript on the issue, and we would be
interested in any comments and criticisms you might have. It is posted
[here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/163075/Oakland.roughdraft.pdf).
Thanks.
