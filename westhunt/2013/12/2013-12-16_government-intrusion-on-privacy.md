Government intrusion on privacy



My younger boys interviewed a state senator, for a merit badge, and it
turns out that he knew that there was a loose board that allows one to
go directly from the linen closet to the bathroom, without using the
door.

***In our house.***

Thatâ€™s taking things pretty far.
