Poles in the Tent

Among hunter-gatherers, men typically do the hunting, while women
gather edible plants. Men are of course better at hunting serious
game, since they have much greater upper body strength than women,
except in the vicinity of Amherst, Massachusetts.

This division of labor affected their relative parental contributions.
In the high Arctic, vegetable foods were scarce and most food was
procured by men. In tropical and subtropical areas, like ancestral
Africa, women typically provided more than half the calories. At least
this seems to be the case for recent hunter-gatherers, who live in
pretty crappy environments, such as deep forests or the Kalahari desert.
Things may have been different in the past, when hunter-gatherers also
inhabited the most productive environments.

I’m considering a different question: what was the impact of men’s
contribution on their children’s survival and fitness? That’s not quite
the same as the number of calories contributed. Food is not a single
undifferentiated quantity: it’s a category, including a number of
different kinds that can’t be freely substituted for each other.
Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates can all serve as fuel, but you need
protein to build tissue. And amino acids, the building blocks of
proteins, are not all fungible. Some we can’t synthesize (essential
amino acids) others can only be synthesized from a limited set of
precursors, etc. Edible plants often have suboptimal mixes of amino
acids ( too many Qs, not enough Us) , but I’ve never heard of this being
a problem with meat. Then you have to consider essential fatty acids,
vitamins, and trace elements.

In principle, if high-quality protein were the long pole in the tent,
male provisioning of meat, which we see in chimpanzees, might matter
quite a bit more than you would think from the number of calories
alone. I’m not say that is necessarily the case, but it might be, and
it’s worth checking out.
