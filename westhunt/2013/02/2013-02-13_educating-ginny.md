Educating Ginny

We’ve home-schooled our kids through 8th grade. That has had its ups and
downs. At one point, just after the twins were born, I decided to have a
look at the history of World War Two, the greatest of all wars. I
thought that anyone who came to understand WWII would have taken a big
step towards understanding history, the human condition, and all that.
And, with any luck, they’d never get the perverted idea that wars are
fun. So I dumped a pile of books on Ginny, my oldest, and told her to
read them.

I’m forgetting some, but the list included

Company Commander, Charles MacDonald

Churchill’s series:

The Gathering Storm  
Their Finest Hour  
The Grand Alliance  
The Hinge of Fate  
Closing the Ring  
Triumph and Tragedy

The Ultra Secret, Winterbotham

The Double-Cross System, J. C. Masterman

Man On A Raft, Kenneth Cooke

Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943, Antony Beevor

Day of Infamy, Walter Lord

Incredible Victory (Midway), Walter Lord

Lonely Vigil: Coastwatchers of the Solomons, Walter Lord

Eagle Against the Sun – Ronald Spector

\+ a few others.

She ended up reading 200 pages a day for a long time. This may have been
a mistake, since she was only ten years old. She’s still mad at me. On
the other hand, she hasn’t initiated any aggressive wars \[the supreme
international crime, except when we or our special friends do it\]. And
that’s good.

P.S. corrections – I found the list. Scratch The Ultra Secret, add
Escape from Colditz, by P. R. Reid, To Lose a Battle, by Alistair Horne,
and Miracle at Midway by Gordon Prange
