Narrow Distribution

For American blacks, the variance in IQ and IQ-like tests is
significantly smaller than it is in whites – 65-80% as big. You already
knew that the mean was \~ 1 std lower. Smaller for IQ, SAT, MCAT, bar
exams, CBEST, and ACT.

I don’t know why, and I doubt if anyone does. I had a notion yesterday,
but I’m not sure it works.

While I’m at it, another obscure fact: the 1-std difference exists in
congenitally deaf kids. Both groups have lower verbal scores than kids
with normal hearing, but differ by about 1 std.
