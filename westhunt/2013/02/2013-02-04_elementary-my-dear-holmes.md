Elementary, my dear Holmes

We have a paradox. We can measure nonpaternity over the past few hundred
years by genealogical studies – do most guys named Sykes have the Sykes
Y-chromosome? Most do, so you know that nonpaternity averaged about 1.3%
in that lineage. Similar genealogical studies gave similar results for
Ireland and the Boers – all under 2%

Last year, a study looked at 971 German kids who needed bone marrow
transplants: genetic data on the HLA genes (which are extremely variable
and thus highly informative) showed a nonpaternity rate just under 1%.

Yet some people *just know* that there’s a lot more adultery going on
than these measurements find. Not just in West Irian or the Congo, where
we don’t have good measurements, but right here in River City.

I can see only one way of reconciling these equally valid kinds of data.
Clearly, people are secretly having assignations with people that happen
to be genetically identical to their spouses.  
Evil twins, mainly. In some cases, women are repeatedly having a secret
rendezvous with their own husband without knowing it. Presumably they
both wear masks. Maybe they’re furries. This is generally known as the
piña colada effect, first described by Rupert Holmes.

I would guess that the husband usually sets up this slightly odd
situation, because of the thrill he gets in cuckolding himself.
Evidently that happens frequently, not just in French farces.
