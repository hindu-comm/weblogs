None So Blind

There have been several articles in the literature claiming that the
*gene frequency* of the 35delG allele of connexin-26, the most common
allele causing deafness in Europeans, has doubled in the past 200 years,
as a result of relaxed selection and assortative mating over that
period.

That’s fucking ridiculous. I see people referencing this in journal
articles and books. It’s mentioned in OMIM. But it’s pure nonsense.
