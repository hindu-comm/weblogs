Endocardial fibroelastosis

Endocardial Fibroelastosis (EFE) is a heart disorder of young children.
It’s characterized by a thickening of the inmost lining of the heart
chambers, usually occurring in children under 2. Back in the day, a few
decades ago, it was halfway common, killing about 1 in 5000 kids.

Now it’s much rarer, almost gone. For a long time (as far back as 1918)
people suspected that the mumps virus had something to do with EFE. When
an effective mumps vaccine was introduced in 1978, EFE practically
disappeared. Since then, genetic investigations of preserved samples
have pretty much nailed mumps as the main cause of EFE.

I don’t miss it.
