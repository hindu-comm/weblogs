Elves, Orcs, and all that

As I understand it, right-thinking people are supposed to act as if men
who have undergone ‘sex-change’ surgery are really women. As opposed to
crazy. The thing is, there are other transitions that people may wish
to make, and I’m wondering if right-thinking people will soon be
expected to honor those people’s new status. I’m talking about elves.

Surgery can certainly give you pointy ears, and for the moment let’s
assume that’s as far as it goes. Will we be expected to pretend that
pointy-eared Americans really *are* elves? When they’re in the Army,
will grizzled NCOs still ask them if they want to live forever? Will
insurance companies feel compelled to charge them low prices for life
insurance and super-high prices for annuities?

Other than an aversion to cold iron, vulnerability to holy names, and
possibly being soulless, being an elf doesn’t sound all that bad. The
transition is a lark, compared to a sex-change operation. In the near
future, I’m sure that the genome can be edited so that their descendants
are born with pointy ears.
