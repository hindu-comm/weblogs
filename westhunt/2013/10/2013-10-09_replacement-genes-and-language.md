Replacement: genes and language

In historical times, sometimes you see conquest followed by elite
dominance: the winners are outnumbered by those they’ve conquered, but
rule them for some time. Usually they eventually dissolve into the
majority population. Sometimes the top dogs lose their language
(Bulgaria, Mitanni, Rus), sometimes they manage to impose it on their
subjects (Ottoman Empire, Hungary) .

Other times, the invaders come close to completely replacing the
previous owners. In a case like that, I would be seriously surprised if
they adopted the language of those they rolled over. Sure, they’d pick
up a few place names, maybe some specialized words: but they wouldn’t
adopt the losers’ language.
