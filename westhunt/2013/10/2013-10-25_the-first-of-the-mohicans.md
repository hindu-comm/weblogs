The First of the Mohicans

I talked about some pieces of this puzzle
[earlier](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/09/22/injun-europeans/):
Patterson and Reich found an Amerindian-like component in Europeans,
especially northern Europeans. Their first calculations showed such
admixture in all Europeans other than Sardinians and Basques: [later
calculations](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2555v2.pdf)found that all
Europeans had this admixture, with the Sardinians and Basques having the
least. Europeans (those they looked at) averaged around 25-35% of this
Amerindian-like component. It might be higher in Scandinavia and the
eastern Baltic. This is all theory, based on existing populations.

Eske Willerslev and Kelly Graf have brand-new ancient DNA results that
bear on this question. They sequenced genetic material from the skeleton
of a boy that died near Lake Baikal about 24,000 years ago. Turns out
that the kid was related to modern Europeans and Amerindians, but not
to East Asian (excuse me, Oriental) populations like the Chinese or
Japanese. The kid had U mtdna, and an R y-chromosome.

We already knew that the old European hunter-gatherers extended very far
to the east, as far as the Urals: looks as if this population extended
well into Siberia. Amerindians – the main old original population, all
the way down into South America – are a mix of this ancient northern
population (about a third) and some Chinesian population.

Amerindian groups show the same relatedness to this Mal’ta culture boy
all the way down into South America, so the admixture happened in early
days – either before the Paleo-Indians arrived south of the glaciers, or
very shortly thereafter. Judging from some anomalous early skeletons,
like Kennewick Man, that don’t look at all like East Asians or modern
Amerindians, it may have happened in America. Sequencing Kennewick Man
would likely answer that question. Looking at the Y-chromosome data, we
may be able to get an idea of who conquered who. Judging from a quick
and incredibly superficial look, Amerindian Y-chromosomes look closer to
some European lineages than to East Asian ones.. while Amerindian
mtDNA lineages (except for X) don’t look close to European mtdna
lineages.

Then we could talk about Joe Greenberg and Merrit Ruhlen’s impression
that Amerindian languages have a very ancient connection with
Indo-European,
