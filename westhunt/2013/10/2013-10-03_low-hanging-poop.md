Low-Hanging Poop

*Clostridium difficile*causes a potentially serious kind of diarrhea
triggered by antibiotic treatments. When the normal bacterial flora of
the colon are hammered by a broad-spectrum antibiotic, *C. difficile*
often takes over and causes real trouble. Mild cases are treated by
discontinuing antibiotic therapy, which often works: if not, the doctors
try oral metronidazole (Flagyl), then vancomycin , then intravenous
metronidazole. This doesn’t always work, and *C. difficile* infections
kill about 14,000 people a year in the US.

One recent [trial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205037)
shows that fecal bacteriotherapy, more commonly called a stool
transplant, works like gangbusters, curing \~94% of patients. The trial
was halted because the treatment worked so well that refusing to poopify
the control group was clearly unethical. I read about this, but thought
I’d heard about such stool transplants some time ago. I had. It was
mentioned in *The Making of a Surgeon*, by William Nolen, published in
1970. Some crazy intern – let us call him Hogan – tried a stool
transplant on a woman with a *C. difficile infection.* He mixed some
normal stool with chocolate milk and fed it to the lady. It made his
boss so mad that he was dropped from the program at the end of the
year. It also worked. It was inspired by a article in *Annals of
Surgery,*so this certainly wasn’t the first try. According to Wiki,
there are more than 150 published reports on stool transplant, going
back to 1958.

So what took so damn long? Here we have a simple, cheap, highly
effective treatment for *C. difficile* infection that has only become
officially valid this year. Judging from the *H. pylori *story*,* it
may still take years before it is in general use.

Obviously, sheer disgust made it hard for doctors to embrace this
treatment. There’s a lesson here: in the search for low-hanging fruit,
reconsider approaches that are embarrassing, or offensive, or downright
disgusting.

Investigate methods were abandoned because people hated them, rather
because of solid evidence showing that they didn’t work.

Along those lines, no modern educational reformer utters a single
syllable about corporal punishment: doesn’t that make you suspect it’s
effective? I mean, why we aren’t we caning kids anymore? The Egyptians
said that a boy’s ears are in his back: if you do not beat him he will
not listen. Maybe they knew a thing or three.

Sometimes, we hate the idea’s *authors*: the more we hate them, the more
likely we are to miss out on their correct insights. Even famous
assholes had to be competent in *some* areas, or they wouldn’t have been
able to cause serious trouble.
