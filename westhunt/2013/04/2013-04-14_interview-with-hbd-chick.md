Interview with HBD Chick

There is a great interview with the blogger who calls herself “HBD
Chick” at [Hoover
Hog](http://hooverhog.typepad.com/hognotes/2013/02/rebel-girl-an-interview-with-hbd-chick.html).
Her focus is Northwestern Europe and its contrasts with the rest of
Europe. One of her foci is cousin marriage and the consequences for
civility and organization of a society. Cousin marriage. she suspects,
focuses loyalty and altruism with the clan (we call this ‘corruption’)
and interferes with loyalty to and organization of larger groups, like
nations.

She inadvertently sets out a challenge to people like me: what exactly
would be the consequences for kin selection (or whatever we call it
these days) of say ten generations of common cousin marriage? Time to
get to work……

Like many of us who are fascinated with human diversity, she has little
or no interest in what are called race differences. The original
impetus for “HBD blogging” seems to have been the reaction of thoughtful
knowledgeable people to the self-righteous squealing and outright lying
that followed*The Bell Curve* and before that Jensen’s 1969 monograph.
No one it seems cares much about that any longer.
