Undecidable Propositions

I’ve been thinking about facts that are true and yet not true – true for
the usual reason that someone would like it to be true, yet false
because the fact strongly (and of course obviously) implies something
else that people don’t want to be true. Enslaved blacks probably were
systematically bred for various qualities, because it would be useful
for some people’s arguments for that to have happened. *It would have
been difficult, considering long human generations, nor does there seem
to be any hard evidence of it – but what am I saying?* Anyhow, at the
same time it can’t be true, because it would imply negative things
about existing black Americans, the products of that breeding
experiment, and we can’t have that.

Some people didn’t like the idea that, over time, most Brits were
descended from the medium-high bourgeoisie, as suggested by Gregory
Clark. In order to remove that taint, they imagined a Merrie England
where landless laborers did just fine, had about the same fitness as
everyone else, rather than withering away over the generations. Of
course, in this ‘blessed isle’ scenario, the gentry must have been
really nice people – so why would having them as ancestors bother
anyone?

James Heckman looked at a a series of cognitive tests given to
low-birth-weight 3-year-olds. Children of mothers who had graduated
from college scored much higher at age 3 than those whose mothers had
dropped out of high school, proof of the advantage for young children of
living in rich, stimulating environments. The difference in cognitive
performance was just as big at age 18 as it had been at age 3. The gap
is there before kids walk into kindergarten,” Mr. Heckman told me.
“School neither increases nor reduces it.”

Heckman therefore thinks, or maybe the word is exudes, that we should
make massive investments in incredibly early education, especially for
super-disadvantaged kids.

But that can’t be true, because it would indicate that career women
sending their offspring to preschools would have disastrous
consequences. *Which it doesn’t, by the way*.
