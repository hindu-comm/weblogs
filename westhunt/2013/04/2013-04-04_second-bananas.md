Second Bananas

Still thinking about domestication. Mostly, the wild ancestors of
domesticate animals were social: presumably, such behavioral tendencies
were preadaptations that helped the domesticates come to bond with or at
least tolerate people. Social animals can have adaptive personality
variation – difference behavioral strategies. Sometimes those
strategies are facultative, sometimes genetic, sometimes a mix.

I would guess that those wild individuals that account for most of the
ancestry of f a domesticated species didn’t have a representative mix of
personality types. Probably they were more likely to be followers rather
than leaders – not the alphas of the pack, not the most aggressive
stallions. Sidekicks. With dogs, we can probably check this hypothesis
fairly easily, since wolves are still around.
