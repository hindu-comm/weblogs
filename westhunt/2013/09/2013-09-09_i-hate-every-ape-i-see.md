I hate every ape I see

Chimpanzees, although expensive, are really useful for medical
research, since they’re much closer to humans than any other
experimental animal. Yet the Feds are phasing out chimp research, and
are sending them off to Club Chimp. Francis Collins, director of NIH,
says that “new scientific methods and technologies have rendered their
use in research largely unnecessary.” Collins is full of crap, as
usual.
