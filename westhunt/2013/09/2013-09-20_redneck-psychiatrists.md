Redneck Psychiatrists

It has been said that schizophrenia strikes without regard to sex, race,
social class, or culture. Whoever said that must be crazy: it’s far
from true. Schizophrenia is more common in men than women – about 1.4
to 1. It’s more common in the lowest SES groups, although that may be
downward drift. Schizophrenia is considerably more common among people
of African ancestry. In the US, about 3 times more common. It seems
that immigrants are more vulnerable, all else equal: that might be
because crazy people are more likely to pull up stakes, or maybe being a
stranger and afraid in a world you never made is bad for your mental
health. Schizophrenia seems to be more common among people that grew up
in cities – about twice as common. If we took this risk as seriously as
teeny-tiny / uncertain dietary cancer risks, the freeways tomorrow
morning would be clogged with frantic refugees fleeing the caves of
steel.

African immigrants to Europe and Great Britain are *much* more
vulnerable to schizophrenia. In the UK, blacks (from the Caribbean)
have a seven to ten-fold increased risk. Interestingly, this actually
seems to get worse in the second generation.

This would be more interesting if schizophrenia was a natural category,
easy to definitively diagnose. There’s something there, surely, but
clean-cut it’s not. There is reason to suspect that people researching
mental illness are crazier than average: this hasn’t helped.

Many – most! – of the articles addressing the higher rate of diagnosed
schizophrenia among blacks attribute it to clinician bias. Jonathan
Metzl has written a whole book on this thesis: *The Protest Psychosis*.
Judging from those high rates in Afro-Caribbeans (as much as 15 times
higher !) British psychiatrists must be the world’s most rabid
rednecks. They probably begin therapy by making the patient squeal like
a pig. But psychiatrists in the US must be highly racist as well.
Somehow this has escaped the stereotype factory: that isn’t the way
psychiatrists portrayed on the big screen. It’s more about eating
someone’s liver “with some fava beans and a nice Chianti”, or stalking
Capucine.

If we understood mental illness better, these epidemiological patterns
would probably be telling us something interesting.. As it is, I’m not
sure.
