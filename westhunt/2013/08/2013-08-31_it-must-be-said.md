It Must Be Said

There are facts that were once known, sometimes generally known, that
are now known to but a few. Some of this information loss is caused by
changes in occupational patterns – farmers automatically know something
about heritability, clerks and workers in dark satanic mills, not so
much.

But mostly these facts are unpleasant, at least to some ears. People
who mention such facts are punished – generally in terms of their
careers, not being invited to parties, etc. That’s enough to cause a 10
or 20-fold drop in visibility, which ought to tell you something about
how brave people are. Many people assume that everyone is secretly aware
of those unpleasant facts, but that is not the case. A generation that
has grown up never hearing those facts will be almost entirely unaware
of them, in part because their personal life experiences don’t impinge
on those patterns much. This means that they can and sometimes do make
serious mistakes that those ‘secretly aware’ types never would.

Now there are a few cases where a lot of information leaks through
anyhow – that’s certainly the case with facts concerning the differences
between the sexes. There’s an article about sex-typical play in little
kids that has been written over and over and over. It starts with some
Ivy-league nitwit who knows for sure that little boys and girls are just
the same, except for minor differences in plumbing, and then can’t quite
manage to unnotice his little girl playing with dolls while his
four-year old boy chews a piece of toast into the shape of a gun and
then mows him down.

Ron Unz has supported The American Conservative, and as a result, had
some columns published in that magazine. For the most part, I thought
that the points he tried to make in those articles (rapid IQ convergence
for Mexican immigrants, Harvard favoring Jews in admissions, etc)
ranged from clearly wrong to unproven, no case made. Recently he
submitted a piece on high crime rates among American blacks – Henry and
I talked about some of the points in it. In particular, I had doubts
about high estimates for the number of ‘missing’ black men.

But the article was unquestionably correct in its major conclusion.
Blacks in the US have very high crime rates, and there is a very high
correlation between the local crime rate and the local black
percentage. That’s the way it is.

And that article is what got Ron kicked off TAC’s board. No good deed
goes unpunished.

Someone I know at TAC opined that everyone knows this stuff, and talking
about it is just mean. I think he is mistaken: you have to state
important facts every so often, or nobody knows them anymore.

There are a lot of facts like this. It’s made even worse by charlatans
spewing falsehoods – sometimes that’s all that the typical undergraduate
is exposed to. For example, average brain size is not the same in all
human populations. Average cranial capacity in Europeans is about
1362; 1380 in Asians, 1276 in Africans. It’s about 1270 in New Guinea.
Generally there is a trend with latitude – brain volume is lowest near
the equator. And no, despite Gould’s bushwa, there is nothing
especially difficult about measuring brain volume. Direct measurement
of a healthy brain is best; but that is now done, using magnetic
resonance imagery, and the results are about the same – a mean
black-white difference of about 1 standard deviation.

*Graduate students in anthropology* generally don’t know those facts
about average brain volume in different populations. Some of those
students stumbled onto claims about such differences and emailed a
physical anthropologist I know, asking if those differences really
exist. He tells them ‘yep’ – I’m not sure what happens next. Most likely
they keep their mouths shut. Ain’t it great, living in a free country?

Anyhow, I intend to occasionally make a clear statement of some hateful
fact – not necessarily because I have anything new to say on the subject
(which is what I prefer).  Someone has to corrupt the rising
generations.
