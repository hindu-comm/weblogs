Linear Pottery – Linearbandkeramik

[![haak5HR](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/haak5hr.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/haak5hr.jpg)

The Linear Pottery Culture is another important strand of European
prehistory: they may be a major ancestral component of modern Europe.
They showed up around 5500 BC on the Middle Danube, possibly stemming
from the Starčevo culture in the Balkans.

LBK farmers often farmed near rivers and loess soils. They grew emmer
and einkorn wheat, peas,and lentils. They raised cattle, goats, and
pigs. They used flint tools, and traded flint over long distances, but
weren’t yet using metals.

It is safe to say that the LBK culture was not, for the most part, a
local development – local Mesolithic foragers adopting agriculture –
because their mtDNA was very different from those foragers. \~80% of
forager mtDNA was in haplogroup U, none of LBK mtDNA.

LBK mtDNA was also significantly different from that seen in modern
Europeans. For example, 25% of LBK mtDNA was in the N1a haplogroup, but
the current frequency of N1a in Europeans is lower by a factor of 100.

Something drastic must have happened to cause this genetic
discontinuity.
