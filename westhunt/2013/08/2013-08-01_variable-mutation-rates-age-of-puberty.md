Variable mutation rates- age of puberty

I’ve already talked about how high paternal age can increase the
per-year and per-generation rates. There’s another factor that can
cause variation in the mutation rate: differences in the age of male
puberty. At least that seems likely, from what we know of the mechanism
driving the male mutation rate – the 23 replications per year of the
sperm-forming cells.

Setting up the spermatogonial cells requires about 30 replications:
after puberty, those stem cells continue dividing indefinitely, and
mutations accumulate at the rate of about 2 per year. So, all else
equal, late male puberty should mean a lower male mutation rate. In
modern industrialized (i.e. chubby) populations, puberty hits at age
13. Among Bushmen, it’s 17.

Mothers contribute about 15 mutations, independent of age, while fathers
contribute about 25 +2\*(g-20) – measured in Iceland, a modern
industrial population. For a modern industrial population with an
average paternal age of 28 and an average maternal age of 28,
generation length is 28 and the average kids inherits 56 mutations.
That’s 56 per generation, 2 per calendar year. You’d expect to see
fewer in a similar population with later puberty: 8 fewer in a
population with puberty four years later. So you’d see an average of 48
mutations per generation (85% of the previous rate) and 1.7 per calendar
year. To me this suggests that measurements of mutation rates in modern
populations may not be quite the thing you want to in order estimate the
long-term mutation rate in humans. Measurement on on some fairly
hard-scrabble population might be better.
