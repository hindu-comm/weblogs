There can only be one!

Dynasties decay. The founder generally has a lot on the ball – tough,
a natural leader, and canny campaigner – but his son is unlikely to be
so exceptional. Partly this is a manifestation of regression to the
mean, and partly because his mother was probably chosen for something
other than her talents as a warlord. By the fourth or fifth generation,
it can be hard to believe that the useless poet on the throne is truly a
member of the Golden Family.

This decay is a fundamental historical fact – an inevitable consequence
of biology and primogeniture. It’s one of the important weaknesses of
dynastic rule. The Ottomans, however, found a way around it for some
centuries – the law of fratricide. Upon the death of the Sultan, all of
his sons were theoretically eligible for the succession (not just the
oldest). Since the Sultan had a harem, there were a lot of them.
Whoever first seized power then had all his brothers and half-brothers
executed by ritual strangulation. Incompetents didn’t win out in this
struggle.

In practice the law of fratricide was not quite this simple, and
imperfectly fair. Older sons were assigned provincial governorships,
and a Sultan could assign a favored son to a close-in province,
increasing his chance of being the first to Istanbul. This ensured that
the successor had administrative experience. It cannot have been pure
truncation selection for genetic awesomeness, because younger brothers
(toddlers, for example) were at a disadvantage.

This system was effective. The first few Sultans were competent, even
before the law of fratricide. Partly that was due to a less formal
forms of competition for the throne, involving rebellions and civil
wars, but some was probably luck: that’s why the Ottoman state existed
rather than an expanded Sultanate of Rum or whatever. The law of
fratricide kept the streak going: the Ottoman state had ten competent
rulers in a row. I think no other state can make such a claim.

The system worked, but I doubt if anyone enjoyed it. Starting around
1600, things changed. The ‘rule of elderness’ was adopted – all males
within an older generations were exhausted before the succession of the
eldest male in the next generation. Eligible males other than the new
Sultan were locked up in the kafes \[‘the cage’\], a suite of rooms deep
within the Topkapi palace. Their education ceased. They were allowed
barren concubines, and some other recreations, mainly macrame. Some of
these people emerged much later as the new, deeply confused Sultan: the
last Sultan, Mehmet VI, emerged at the age of 56, totally ignorant of
the Empire and everything else, other than macrame.
