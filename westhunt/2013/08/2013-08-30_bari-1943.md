Bari, 1943



There is no really good general way of estimating which facts that
another person has floating in his head without personal contact. The
same is true for populations – people in general, people in particular
professions, etc. Sometimes, though, the utter lack of recognition of
what ought to be an obvious connection, the dogs that don’t bark,
makes clear that nobody in the talking classes has ever heard of a
particular event.

They ought to be talking about Bari, 1943.
