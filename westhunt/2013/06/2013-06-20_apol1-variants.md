APOL1 Variants

Apolipoprotein LI is a serum protein, a component of HDL, sometimes
called ‘good cholesterol’. It has another function: it protects people
from trypanosomal infections – the kind of protozoa that cause sleeping
sickness. That is, it protects against most of them. Two strains can
get past this defense: *T.b. gambiense* and *T.b. rhodesiense.[  
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei_rhodesiense "Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense")*

The APOL1 defense is a nonstandard innate immune defense, specific for
trypanosomes. It chops holes in their surface membranes. You need this
in sub-Saharan Africa, because the adaptive immune system can’t deal
with trypanosomes, due to their vast repertoire of coat antigens.

So when you’re bitten by a tsetse fly carrying one of the two strains
that have developed resistance to APOL1, you die, without modern (and
fairly unpleasant) medical treatment. Unless you’re a mutant.

This used to be a major problem, although the risk is lower nowadays.
Here’s a map of the areas subject to sleeping sickness:

Note that cattle (and horses) don’t have APOL1.

It turns out quite a few people who live in or whose ancestors
originated in Sub-Saharan Africa have mutated versions of APOL1, changed
in ways that protect against one of the dangerous strains. These
mutations don’t look all that old, probably less than ten thousand
years. I would guess that humans made up an insignificant fraction of
potential trypanosomal targets before the development of agriculture, so
that there essentially no selection for versions that could get past
human defenses. After our numbers increased, strains that could infect
humans were favored, and sometime after that, mutations that protected
humans against those dangerous strains began to spread.

The problem is that people with two copies of these protective variants
are much more likely to experience kidney failure in later life.
African Americans are 4-5 five times more likely to end up on dialysis
than whites. It used to be that the medicos thought that the kidney
risk was caused by increased levels of hypertension – now it looks as if
it’s probably the other way around.
