Recent work in genetics has made it clear that Tibetans, Andean Indians,
and Ethiopians adapted independently to high-altitude living. It’s
also clear that the Tibetan adaptations are more effective those in
Andean Indians. Infant survival is better in Tibet, where babies average
about half a pound heavier, and the suite of Tibetan adaptations doesn’t
seem to fail with increasing age, while a significant fraction of
Andean Indians develop chronic mountain sickness in later life. The
Andean pattern look something like an exaggerated acclimatization
response, while the Tibetan pattern is more like that seen in mammalian
species have lived at high altitude for a long time.

Undoubtedly this is because Tibetans have lived at high altitude far
longer than Amerindians. it’s even possible that some of these alleles
go back to archaic humans, who could have lived in high-altitude areas
of Asia for as much as two million years.

The obvious solution to these apparently permanent problems in Bolivia
and Peru is a dose of Tibetan genes. Since Tibetan alleles are more
effective, they must confer higher fitness, and so their frequencies
should gradually increase with time. This doesn’t mean that Bolivians
would turn Tibetan overall – the change would only happen in those genes
for which the Tibetan version was more efficient. It wouldn’t take all
that high a dose: in fact, if you’re not in a hurry, just a few tens of
Tibetans could transmit enough copies of the key alleles to do the job,
although admittedly you’d have to wait a few thousand years to complete
the process.

Logically, the easiest way to do this would be to encourage some young
Tibetan men to immigrate to the Andes. Clearly, men can be more
effective at this than women. We could pay them to donate to the local
sperm banks. We could subsidize the process, giving cash rewards to the
mothers of part-Tibetan kids, a la the Howard Foundation. We could give
our heros Corvettes. Considering the general level of discontent in
Tibet, it might not be too hard to recruit young men for this kind of
work.

The project would take longer than the usual NIH time horizon, so
probably the best approach is to find some wealthy sponsor. You could
get a sure-fire version of this program going, one big enough to make
ultimate success a racing certainty, for under a million bucks. The
backer would never see the end result, but so what? When we build, let
us think that we build forever.
