Focus

I’ve mentioned the unusually high incidence of certain kinds of
weirdness among prominent mathematicians and physicists. I wondered if
there may be a few deleterious mutations that increase intelligence but
make you squirrelly – and there may be, but there is an easier way.
Imagine someone with very high intelligence who is much more
*interested* in math than any normal person – in a way that would have
reduced fitness in past environments, and likely in this one as well.
If you take two mathletes with equal talents and unequal obsessions, the
guy who has a life is going to be far less productive.

This is fairly obvious, but I think that there is an interesting
implication. The sort of personality we’re talking about is something
like autism. I hate to use that word, because I think autism is
probably a not a good natural category, but it’s useful in this case.
Anyhow, high-functioning autism is *far* more common in males than
females: maybe as much as 15 times more common.

At the highest levels of achievement in math and physics, men far
outnumber women, maybe as much as 100-fold. This may account for a
fair bit of that difference.
