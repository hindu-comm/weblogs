Krazy Kats

The way things are going, the cats with the greatest reproductive
success will be feral, and the cats best adapted to living with people
will have low fitness. Razib Khan has
[talked](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/09/breeding-a-better-companion-cat/#.UoiRPOKKIoI)
about this. There are a number of other cases in which humans are
inadvertently selecting for outcomes they don’t like: deer are getting
smaller antlers, we’re seeing more and more [jack
salmon](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/gross/Gross1991.pdf), etc. And of
course we’re selecting ourselves for this and that, none of it good.

Yet Carlos Driscoll, a University of Oxford biologist, says there’s
nothing to worry about re cats. “The population of domestic cats has
been stable for a very long time,” Driscoll said.  
“There’s a lot of genetic inertia there.”

The thing is, there’s no such thing as genetic inertia. You can change
*any* species with selection. Horseshoe crabs have been around for
something like 450 million years – they’re older than most mountain
ranges – but if you started selecting them for size, or a different
reproductive schedule, or the ability to live in brackish water, or the
ability to play Go – change would come.
