Powerful Stuff

I was thinking
[again](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/06/11/call-him-george/)
about that Denisovan allele of EPAS1 that plays a big role in Tibetan
altitude adaptation. Considering modern humans, it has only been found
in Tibetans (high frequency) and in the Chinese (couple of percent).
The preferred model in the paper is that it entered the common
ancestors of Tibetans and Han, rising to high frequency among the
Tibetans because of its advantage. I doubt this: the authors are
clinging to a claim of a recent split in a previous publication of
theirs – but the idea that the modern Tibetans are a fusion of a
Han-like population with a long-established group of Tibetan
hunter-gatherers seems more likely to me. So the few copies of the
high-altitude EPAS1 allele among the Chinese are probably a result of
recent gene flow, possibly from the [Tibetan
empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Empire) (618-841) that
controlled parts of China, or from ethnic Tibetans identifying as
Chinese.

This allele has some pretty powerful effects on the hypoxia response,
which is there for a reason. The usual evolutionary rule is that change
is bad: even though the Denisovan allele confers a big advantage at high
altitude, the odds are that it is disadvantageous at low altitude. This
would explain why it is rare in China and apparently unknown in Japan.
This would also explain why it never made it to the Andes – even though
there might have been a copy or two in the long-ago East Asian ancestors
of the Amerindians, who have a bit of Denisovan admixture admixture (at
least, I think they do – interesting if that isn’t the case) , it would
most likely have been lost in Beringia. Along the same lines, altitude
adaptations probably never managed to travel from Ethiopia to Tibet,
which is why they have different approaches to altitude adaptation
today.

It is therefore no surprise that this EPAS1 allele does not exist in
Melanesians, even though they have 25 times as much Denisovan ancestry
as mainland East Asians.

At low altitude, it was likely disadvantageous in Denisovans as well.
Probably it was only found in Denisovans who lived at fairly high
altitude, or that had recently migrated from a high-altitude area.
Which suggests that Denisovans in Denisova Cave had recent ancestors
living at high altitude.

The introgression was most likely to be successful in an area where it
conferred advantage, which suggest that admixture probably occurred in
or near the Tibetan plateau. When you think about it, anatomically
modern humans would have more trouble than average displacing archaics
from areas for which they had special adaptations not possessed by AMH –
so Denisovans may have lingered longer in Tibet and neighboring
high-altitude areas, affording greater opportunities for gene flow.
This was especially the case when the local environmental challenge
could not be solved by ancient technology – you can deal with cold
through better clothes, but people weren’t quite up to oxygen masks
40,000 years ago.

As I have said
[before](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/10/23/denisovans-in-wallacea/),
Denisovans might have persisted longer in Sundaland because of
resistance to local infectious disease – same principle.
