Cystic Fibrosis

A friend of mine once had an encounter with a fairly prominent
geneticist\* who thought that there was only one clear example of
heterozygote advantage in humans – sickle-cell. Of course that is not
the case: we know of a number of genetic malaria defenses that work in
similar ways – alpha-thalassemia, beta-thalassemia, G6PD deficiency,
Melanesian ovalocytosis, etc. Not all such are malaria defenses: cystic
fibrosis has some advantage, nature unclear, but it’s not malaria
resistance.

CF is mostly a European disease, particularly in northern Europeans and
their diaspora. The gene frequency for CFTR mutations is around 2%,
mostly one mutation, delta-508. It’s easy to show that CFTR mutations
have some sort of heterozygote advantage, although that same fairly
prominent geneticist didn’t thinkthishad been established. Realize
that the input of new mutations per generation is insignificant. Without
any advantage in carriers , the frequency of mutated CFTR genes should
slowly decline, since the mutation used to be lethal in homozygotes and
is still very, very unpleasant. The rarer these mutant alleles get, the
slower the decline, since a smaller fraction of them run into each
other.

But if you run time backward, the frequency should increase more and
more rapidly. If there was no advantage in carriers, a frequency of 2%
today implies a frequency of 50% 1200 years ago. Takes a code of several
lines to show this!

The scenario is ridiculous. This would require a super-tight
bottleneck, in which Europe was first wiped out and then refounded by a
population of 2 about 1200 years ago, but that never happened – although
it might seem reasonable to some young geneticists. When John Hawks and
I talked about the genetic impact of the big population expansion in the
Neolithic, which greatly increased effective population size, I remember
a person like that saying that we didn’t really know that there was a
large ( \>\> 10,000) population in Pharaonic Egypt. I guess he thought
that Paul Bunyan built the Pyramids. By the way, another *very*
prominent geneticist, upon hearing our idea, asked “Why would there be
more mutations with a larger population?” I got a million of ’em!

I think I don’t know what the advantage was. This puts me ahead of many
people, including Wikipedia, because they think that it’s a cholera
defense. It may well protect against cholera in carriers, but that’s
not why it became common, because cholera was never seen in any part of
Europe until 1817. Better to know nothing than to know what ain’t so.
The people who proposed that in Nature weren’t stupid – they had
evidence that it protected against cholera in vitro. They were merely
deeply ignorant of history. Which is stupid.

\* although I have never quite been able to figure out what he is famous
*for*. I have another, much funnier anecdote about him, by the way.
