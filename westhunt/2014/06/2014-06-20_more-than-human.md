More Than Human

When archaic hominids lived for a long time in special environments,
they naturally developed genetic adaptations to those environments, and
since such adaptive alleles are easily transmitted, requiring only a
smidgen of gene flow, it’s not surprising to see some of the beneficial
archaic alleles in modern humans living in such environments. So
archaic altitude-adaptation alleles were likely in modern Tibetans, and
have apparently been found. They likely exist in Ethiopians,
particularly since their altitude adaptations work so well, as do those
of Tibetans.

It looks as if there is a specific suite of changes that is favored when
living in dense tropical jungles – being some kind of Pygmy. We know
that this has happened repeatedly (Pygmies, various Negritos).  Perhaps
archaic humans lived in and adapted to that niche – they certainly had
plenty of time to do so. If so, we may expect to find archaic-origin
adaptive alleles in those groups. There are already indications of of
gene flow into Pygmies (and Bushmen) from an unknown but highly
divergent archaic lineage. Perhaps there were Pygmy versions of
Denisovans or advanced erectus in Sundaland, which could then have
contributed alleles to modern Negrito groups.
