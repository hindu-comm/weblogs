Kings of the Stone Age

The Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b is extremely common in Western Europe (
\> 70%). At the same time, it doesn’t appear to be very old.

Which facts suggest two possibilities. The first is that this
particular Y-chromosome haplogroup confers some kind of fitness
advantage. It’s moderately improbable, since the Y chromosome doesn’t
contain many genes, but it is possible. It’s more likely considering
that ways of life have changed a lot in the Holocene, so an old version
of the Y might not be very close to optimal, especially in any
behavioral effects.

The other possibility is that there was a male lineage that prospered
enormously in a way similar to the Golden Family, the direct male
descendants of Genghis Khan. We know that reputation has lasted for
about 800 years: as late as the 20th century, a huge fraction of the
nobles in Mongolia were direct male-line descendants of the Master of
Thrones and Crowns. I could see this happening in the big population
turnover about 5000 years ago: a leader of a wildly successful invasion
might build an enduring reputation, such that even a long time later,
people would look to his descendants for leadership. I get the
impression than in Mongolia, you’d automatically expect one of these
guys to organize your sock hop – nobody else would be worthy.

This could extend even to populations that were not really conquered or
replaced by the incoming troublemakers, like the Basque. They too
might have been susceptible to R1b glamor: people have certainly
borrowed dynasties from other countries.

How to find evidence? Well, it would be difficult, but you might be able
to show that graves full of expensive goodies were more likely to hold
dead guys with R1b than poor graves, over a large area and for a long
time. If there was a fitness advantage, you might be able to
demonstrate some kind of difference in men with R1b, a difference that
was plausibly beneficial in the past. And no, I don’t mean sperm
competition.
