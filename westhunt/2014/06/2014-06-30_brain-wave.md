Brain Wave

The standard view is that all human populations have the same average
cognitive capabilities. The world sure doesn’t look as if that’s the
case, and that’s part of the reason that people insist that everyone do
public obeisance to the notion: if it was obviously true, or even looked
plausible, you wouldn’t need to.

But if it were true? What if it *became* true at midnight tonight? To
be more specific, what if the IQ of every natural human population was
bumped up enough to make their average IQ 100? In a group with an
average IQ of 85, every individual would pick up 15 points.

I think the world would change in many ways. I don’t think that
billions of people would wake up tomorrow and immediately say to
themselves “I’ve been stupid.”, as people do after eating their fill of
tree-of-life root and turning Pak. Inpaktification gives you a lot more
than 15 points, enough to be painfully obvious. That, and your dick
drops off.

I do think that a lot of people would feel that something funny was
going on, even on the first day. The crossword puzzle and the Sudoku
would be easier. A question or two that had bugged you for a long time
would suddenly become clear – and that would continue to happen.

Kids from groups with low average IQ today would suddenly start doing
better in school. They wouldn’t know any more tomorrow morning than
they do today, but they would be able to do more with what they did
know, and pick up new information more easily. I think they’d
immediately begin to catch up academically with kids from groups that
already had average IQs of 100: not that it would happen instantly, but
there would be lots of convergence in just a year or two. In the US,
the papers would give credit to whatever useless educational panacea
was currently fashionable – quite possibly if it hadn’t even been
implemented yet! But some would begin to wonder, even some of those who
were formerly famously clueless. Malcolm Gladwell would suddenly find
“igon values” easy to understand. He might even wonder why they hadn’t
been before.

A few years after the change, the Ivy League would be utterly saturated
with the currently preferred low-achieving minorities, because for a
while, they’d get big advantages in admissions without getting low
scores. They’d be in like Flynn! Probably this would not go on for too
long, though: true liberals would soon find these people unsatisfying.
Clearly, they would no longer be keeping it real.

It doesn’t mean that governments would instantly fall, or institutions
crumble in a moment (although some might). If you lived in a
kakistocracy, there’s no guarantee that government would instantly
straighten out. Remember, the jerks at the top would have gotten smarter
too. Execution would improve, though: simple things would get done more
efficiently, and you wouldn’t have the feeling that life was one long
visit to the DMV.  Sheer friction would decrease. Planes in Africa
would, after a few years, crash at rates closer to what we see in
developed countries.

People would still hate each other and there would be still be wars, but
they would be fought more cleverly. Fewer machetes, more Enigma
decoding. Deterrence might work better..

Violent crime would decline. Birth rates would plunge, and more people
would worry about low birth rates.

Right now, H1Bs work because there are some parts of the world where
there are a fair number of people with high human capital and limited
local opportunities. That pool would expand greatly, I think. You’d be
getting lots of H1B engineers from Indian scheduled castes – from
Bolivia, and Gabon. From Egypt and Indonesia. Even from PNG! For that
matter, all sorts of countries that are not very competitive for factory
labor today would become so, although that would also depend on the
decisions of the local elites – elites that had become somewhat more
prone to consider the long run.

In other words, it would in some ways be like the end of Communism in
China, when a billion people stopped whopping themselves on the head
with ball-peen hammers and sickles. They ended artificial stupidity,
which is easier than inventing artificial intelligence.

To an extent, smart populations today make money by having something
that’s not over common. As smarts became more common, the premium would
go down. On the other hand, if these newly-average populations produce
a proportionate number of inventions and discoveries, technological
progress would be faster, benefiting everyone.  Being an average
country in a highly competent, rapidly advancing world might not be so
bad.

Some countries that have historically been spear carriers, or used as
footballs, might actually become players. Nobody thinks much about
Indonesia, but if they had German levels of human potential, maybe we
would. Maybe we’d have to.

Little wars against formerly dipshit countries would sometimes turn very
unpleasant. I’m not saying Iraq unpleasant, more like Winter War
unpleasant. Embarrassing.

The US would gain relative to Iceland, since the Icelanders don’t even
have minorities with low IQs (other than trolls) , but Mozambique would
gain relative to both.

Science and technology would go like blazes, but it would be harder to
make a living as a scientist.

The number of people capable of coming up with plausible or attractive
bullshit would increase as much as eightfold. More ideas, almost all of
them wrong, would be flying around the net.

We’d live in interesting times.
