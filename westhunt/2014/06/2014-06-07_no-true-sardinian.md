No true Sardinian

I am led to believe that other genetic samples from Sardinia don’t
necessarily show the same degree of weirdness that you see in the HGDP
samples: they look more admixed, more cosmopolitan. The guess is that
Cavalli-Sforza knew what he was doing, and chose samples from the most
isolated, mountainous, gnarly villages.

In a way, this should encourage people searching for genetic traces of
the far past. What we see in those HGDP samples is not just a product
of the unique history and ecology of Sardinia (although that surely
helped) – it also depended on very local effects. This suggests that you
might find interesting genetics in a number of out-of-the-way,
hard-to-get-to corners of the world. Places that the tax-collectors
couldn’t even reach. Maybe even in Europe, not just in Kafiristan or
Shangri-La.
