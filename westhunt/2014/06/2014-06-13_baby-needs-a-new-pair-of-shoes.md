Baby Needs a New Pair of Shoes

Years ago, working at Hughes Aerospace, I had a set of dealy-boppers,
which I would don when talking on the phone to someone I thought an
idiot but had to be polite to. I would nod a lot as I listened to the
other guy speak.

I need a new set, so it’s time for you to contribute, if you can. If I
get 20 more requests, I’ll have some more T-shirts made up. If that
happens, all of my archaic readers – Denisovan, Hobbit, Neanderthal,
whatever – will get one free.

You can suggest blog topics, fat lot of good that’s likely to do you.
Paypal still works. Checks do too, and they might, possibly, become
retroactively tax-exempt. No guarantees on that – email me for details.

If you have exotic donations in mind, like Bitcoin, goolie chits, or Rai
stones, email me at gcochran9@comcast.net. I could probably set up
Google Wallet if anyone is interested, and other suggestions along those
lines are welcome.

I am considering an audio version of the book, with a number of pungent
additions, in addition to a possible second edition. Is there interest
in an audio book?
