Sardinia

[![800px-Sardinia_topo](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/800px-sardinia_topo.png?w=640&h=823)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/800px-sardinia_topo.png)

The question has been raised: how did the Sardinians manage to stay
genetically similar to the typical European farmers of six thousand
years ago? Why haven’t the currents of history homogenized them? I’ve
wondered myself.

Sardinia has been conquered over and over again: Carthaginians, Romans,
Vandals, Goths, Byzantines, etc, etc. But ever since the Carthaginian
conquest, the island has had a serious problem with falciparum malaria,
which hit the marshy lowlands, which also happened to be the areas that
the conquerors were interested in, because of their high agricultural
potential. It looks as if those areas were population sinks – so the
foreigners that moved in were evanescent. The Romans, for example,
faced labor supply problems, which forced them to constantly replenish
the island’s work force with slaves, prisoners, and political exiles.
All this time the old-fashioned Sardinians are persisting in the
highlands, raising sheep and goats, while resisting Roman control for
more than a century.

People in the lowlands eventually developed various genetic defenses to
malaria, but their genetic contribution may have been limited by Moslem
raids on the coast, which continued for several hundred years.

If I had to guess, I’d explain Sardinian old-fashioned genetics mostly
by malaria in the lowlands and outsiders not really wanting the rocky
highlands.
