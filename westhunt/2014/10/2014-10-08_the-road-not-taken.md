The Road Not Taken

A lot of people are bothered by the idea of biological determinism – the
idea that given the genetic hand they’ve been dealt, and the environment
they experienced, their path in life was essentially inevitable. When
you consider the fates of identical twins raised apart, particularly
examples like the [Jim
twins](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/biological-determinism/),
you can feel boxed in. In a philosophical sense, that is: you are
probably thinking too hard if the the fact that your non-existent clone
might have gone down much the same life path as you engenders
weltschmerz.

If it does, though, there’s a way out of it. Find a situation with at
least two alternate courses of action that are sure to lead to wildly
different outcomes, and make your choice based on a truly random event,
such as nuclear decay. Even if your clone did exactly the same thing,
there’s no way of predicting what path he would take\*. If you’re
feeling wimpy, you can restrict your paths to ones that don’t have a
high likelihood of immediate crucifixion.

On the other hand, if you are truly determined, you can pick paths that
are chaotic as well, so that infinitesimal difference in your initial
actions will eventually lead to big differences in your trajectory. In
that case, though, all bets are off.

I’m thinking that there’s probably already an app for this.
