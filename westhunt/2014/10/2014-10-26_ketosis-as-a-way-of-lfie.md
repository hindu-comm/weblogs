Ketosis as a way of life

There’s a new article out in
[ASHG](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929714004224)
that discusses a regional selective sweep in CPT1A, carnitine
palmitoyltransferase 1A, which plays an essential role in fatty acid
metabolism. A mutation has become extremely common, with a gene
frequency \> 50%, in northeast Siberian populations, Eskimos, and
Aleuts. This happened even though the c.1436C>T mutation has some
negative side effects, such as reduced fasting tolerance and,
apparently, a higher risk of infant death.

It looks as if this variant conferred significantly higher fitness
(\~15%) over the past few thousand years and has increased very
rapidly. Almost certainly, this has something to do with traditional
diets in these areas, in which fat provided 80-85% of energy and protein
15-20%, with hardly any carbohydrates. We’ll know more about the
biochemical details of how this mutation works when someone makes a
mouse model.

This could only happen in the Arctic, where agriculture is impossible,
plant foods limited, and marine mammals use blubber as insulation.

It illustrates an important point, mentioned in our book: an ancestral
diet might have some payoff, but likely the appropriate diet would be
the foods eaten by *your* ancestors, not somebody else’s.
