The Genghis-Khan effect

We know of several examples of a huge expansion of a paternal lineage,
and several other cases seem likely to be the same thing. It’s worth
taking a close look at the [first
one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180246/) found, the
paternal lineage of Genghis Khan.

8% of the men in Central Asia carry this y-chromosome, half a percent
of all men. One of the authors of that study made an interesting
mistake: Chris Tyler-Smith, in an interview, said “We don’t think that
Genghis Khan was the common ancestor, because our best estimate of the
time when the common ancestor lived was a few generations before he was
born.”

Now that’s silly, because are big error bars in that kind of TMRCA, not
least when you’re doing Y-chromosomes with STRs, the state of the art at
that time. If you found a piece of trinitite at Alamagordo and came up
with a date of 1943 from some kind of radioactive dating, forget it: it
was July 16th, 1945, 05:29:21 MWT (plus or minus 2 seconds). In much
the same way, we know when Genghis Khan made his historical moves, and
we know who the rewards flowed to – his sons, and a smaller fraction to
his full brothers, not his cousins or whatever. Genghis’s sons got
countries, had harems, founded dynasties: he (or maybe his father,
depending upon how successful Hasar and Hachiun were) is the TMRCA .

It seems to me that this error stems from geneticists thinking that
genetic data is the only real data: sloppy genetic time estimates trump
precise historical dates. In much the same way, people (using the old
too-high mutation rate) estimated that the split with Neanderthals was
\~300,000 years ago, even though the fossil record clearly showed
hominids in Europe shambling towards Neanderhood half a million years
ago. The new, lower estimates of the mutation rate have reconciled
genetic and paleontological evidence on the split time – but the
geneticists should have realized that there was an inconsistency.

Unfortunately other disciplines have the exact same problem.

Anyhow, the existence of the Genghis effect should have us thinking more
generally, about Clark’s survival of the richest, or about populations
that grow from hundreds to millions in a few centuries, after chancing
on a favorable ecological niche (moneylending, or being pacifist farmers
in America, or perhaps a ruling class after a conquest). A ruling class
could end up replacing the original conquered population without even
intending to, if it stayed fairly endogamous while having higher
fertility than the serfs.
