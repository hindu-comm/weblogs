The Day Before Forever

Yesterday, I was discussing the possibilities concerning slowing, or
reversing aging – why it’s obviously possible, although likely a hard
engineering problem. Why partial successes would be valuable, why
making use of the evolutionary theory of senescence should help, why we
should look at whales and porcupines as well as Jeanne Calment, etc.,
etc. I talked a long time – it’s a subject that has interested me for
many years.

But there’s one big question: why are the powers that be utterly
uninterested ?
