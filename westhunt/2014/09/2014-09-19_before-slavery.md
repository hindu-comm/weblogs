Before Slavery

We keep hearing more about European genetic prehistory, and the picture
is coming together. In one new
[paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2014/09/03/008664.full.pdf),
we hear aDNA results from the Carpathian Basin. It’s clear that the LBK
farmers are the same people as the earlier Starcevo culture in the
Balkans, and that those farmers are genetically quite distinct from the
original hunter-gatherers of Europe. If you consider uniparental markers
( mtDNA and the Y-chromosome), they look to have incorporated very few
local foragers. U5b is by far the most common mtDNA haplotype among the
old hunters – I’m not sure that it’s been seen at all in the LBK
farmers. Almost all of the known Y chromosomes among the farmers (both
LBK in central Europe and Cardial along the Med) are G2a2 – 29 out of
32. Today G2a2 is not common in Europe – you find some in the hills of
southern Europe.

Reich and Patterson think that the EEF, the farmers, have a fair amount
of WHG ancestry: I wonder how they managed that while picking up very
little hunter uniparental markers.

They also have an abstract out for a talk at ASHG: we knew that modern
Europeans are very different from the EEF, especially in modern Europe,
but we didn’t know when those new populations (which also have the
Sibermen taint) showed up. Turns out that the Corded Ware population
has that new flavor: they are probably the Indo-European invaders of
northern Europe, as many had suspected.

[![Corded_Ware_culture](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/corded_ware_culture.png?w=640&h=464)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/corded_ware_culture.png)

From what I can see so far, it looks as the invaders killed all the
LBK-descended farmers in northern Europe, or nearly so. The locals had
had long trapezoidal houses clustered in small villages: the Corded Ware
culture has almost no buildings at all, and a lot less agriculture.
They didn’t make the EEF guys serfs and get a cut of their grain – the
villages disappeared. They didn’t tax them, but then money and
bureaucracy hadn’t been invented yet. Same for slavery: hadn’t been
invented, probably. Judging from the mtDNA patterns, they didn’t even
grab many of the nubile women. The genetic mix changes little as you
move across the north European plain: if the invaders were picking up
local genes as they rolled along, it should have.

We used to call Corded Ware the Battle-Axe culture, but that’s too
accurate for comfort.

Probably-related groups had already crushed the Old European cultures of
the Balkans: maybe they acquired a taste for devastation – better to
burn out than fade away, right?

Again, and this is a guess, it looks as if something less genocidal
happened in most of southern Europe. Autosomally, southern Europeans
are mostly EEF – sometimes almost entirely so, like highland Sardinians.
Yet there has been a big turnover in Y-chromosomes: G2A2 is now fairly
rare in most parts of southern Europe. Sounds like patrilineal
conquest: the sons of warriors and aristocrats went forth conquering,
but married local girls, diluting their original autosomal flavor
(rather like India and Iran, but that’s another story!). The warrior
culture worked, kept expanding, even so, and the original EEF men have
few Y-chromosomal descendants today – mostly in places that the
conquerors didn’t really want.

In some cases, the patrilineal warriors were diluted to the point that
they imposed their Y chromosomes and literally nothing else – very few
autosomal genes, not even language. Plausible for the Basque.
