Slow times in the New World

The pre-Columbian distribution of languages in the Americas is rather
different from what we see in the Old World. In Eurasia, Africa, and
Australia, we mostly see large areas occupied by families of clearly
related languages – such as
[Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-european),
[Afro-Asiatic,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Asiatic_languages)
[Niger-Congo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger-Congo_languages),
[Malayo-Polynesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayo-Polynesian_languages),
and [Pama-Nyungan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pama-Nyungan) . Much
splotchier and localized in the Americas.

It seems that each of these large language families is the product of a
massive, relatively recent population expansion. Not without admixture,
usually, but some group developed some sort of advantage and rolled over
its neighbors. This means in most of the world where we have
information, the current inhabitants are quite different genetically
from the people who lived there 10,000 years ago.

Europe experienced two expansions (first Middle Eastern farmers and then
sort-of Siberian Indo-Europeans). Guys from Western Asia (and
eventually some Indo-European speakers) flooded into an India originally
occupied by people distantly related to the Andaman islanders. Bantu
farmers swamped most of Africa’s hunter-gatherers. Somehow some genes
and ideas traveled from India to Australia (about five thousand years
ago, triggering an expansion that covered most of the continent.
Chinese-looking people largely replaced the original inhabitants of
Southeast Asia – the Cambodians seem to have a significant admixture
from the previous tenants. Similar story for the Malayo-Polynesians in
the Philippines and Indonesia. Chinesian farmers moved up in the world
and mixed with altitude-hardy proto-Sherpas to give us Tibetans.
Levantines carried languages and farming into Ethiopia (undoubtedly
picking up the local altitude adaptations).

Although the Americas were settled more recently than any other
continent, they have an older-looking language distribution – because
there there just hasn’t been as much population turnover there in the
Holocene. You don’t see the same dramatic population expansions. Until
Columbus, of course.  We have good reason to think this, because
they’ve just sequenced a child’s skeleton from the Clovis culture,
11,000 years ago, and the kid is genetically similar to contemporary
Amerindians. Genetic continuity over such a long period is not seen in
most of the Old World – probably only in a few places.

Which is not to say there has been no expansions or population turnover
in the Americas- just considerably less so than in most places of the
Old World. The Na-Dene were late arrivals who had a decent expansion.
There have been fair-sized expansions that originated among the
descendants of the original settlers, like the Algonquians. But
languages have had longer to differentiate in the Americas, because the
slate hasn’t recently been wiped clean here. All the Amerindian
language families other than Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleut must form an
ancient family that only smart guys like Greenberg, Ruhlen and Sapir
could see.

Linguists usually assert that language and genes are entirely separate,
but they had it backwards. Genetic expansions play a key role in
language expansions. From current data, every time, in prehistory.

Why have there been fewer and less powerful population expansions in the
Americas? I don’t know, but I can guess. Agriculture came later: that
may matter, but it can’t be a necessary cause, because both Pama-Nyungan
and Na-Dene managed decent expansions before agriculture. Maybe
acquiring a winning advantage against other groups was difficult in the
Americas because the population was so genetically uniform -much more so
than in any other continent. Cultural innovations aren’t as good as
genes at conferring a long-lasting advantage – you can copy them.

What else? Before the advent of the Indo-Europeans, almost all of
Europe must have spoken related languages, originating somewhere in the
Middle East or Balkans, carried by the
[LBK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBK) and [Impressed
Ware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressed_Ware) culture. Basque must
be the last survivor of that family, rather like the
[tuatara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara). [Theo

you hear me?
