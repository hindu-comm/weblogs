Silver Blaze

The recent
[paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/12/23/001552.figures-only)
on three ancestral European populations has some truly interesting stuff
buried deep in the supplements. This is not the first time that this
has happened: if you read the supplements to their big Neanderthal
paper, back in 2010, you could see a strong implication that
Melanesians, (people in New Guinean, the Solomons, and Australian
Aboriginals) had experienced an additional admixture with archaic humans
( as it turned out, \~5% from Denisovans). That implication was
obscured by an incorrect caption, and in any event it was on page 136…
 I’m not sure anyone else noticed.

In this case, they talk about the third ingredient that moved into
Europe. They conclude that in most parts of Europe, it looks as if
modern populations inherited the three EEF/WHG/ANE groups ( Levantine
farmers, West Hunters and Sibermen) via only *two* proximate ancestral
populations. Europe at the time was almost entirely occupied by
Sardinian-like farmers – then another population moved in, one that had
about 3 times as much West Hunter as Sibermen. The hint is that the
ratio of WHG to ANE is almost a constant. They put it this way: a large
number of European populations are consistent with descent from
identical “Farmer” and “Hunter (= WHG + ANE)” populations. ”

Here’s a thought experiment. Imagine that Mexicans are half Spanish and
half Amerindian – then drop them in varying amounts in various Korean
provinces. The total Mexican fraction may vary, but the amount of
Amerindian ancestry in a given province will always be the same as the
amount of Spanish ancestry.

This means that the WHG fraction you see came with along the ANE guys –
it is not a comeback by the descendants of the original hunter-gatherers
of central and Western Europe, who were somewhere between much
diminished and extinct, but an invasion (from farther east, probably)
by a group that is somewhat related to those original hunter-gatherers
and also has a fair amount of ancestry from Sibermen- a population that
also contributed to Amerindians. You could see hints of this in the
haplotypes and uniparental lineages – I
[talked](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/real-continuity-and-fake-continuity/)
about it earlier.

This also means that the change in ancestry around 3000 BC was not small
– it’s much bigger than the ANE fraction. The suddenly-appearing
component accounts for half or more of the ancestry of all the
populations of northern Europe, all the way from Belorussia to
Scotland. That population might also have had some EEF, in which case
the population replacement factor would be even bigger.

The WHG + ANE fraction is about half in France, lower than that in the
South of France. It’s much lower in southern Europe. The Albanians,
Ashkenazi Jews, Greeks, Maltese and Sicilians have essentially no WHG
ancestry, while a decent fit is possible for the Basque, French_South,
Bergamo, Pais-Vasco, and Sardinians using no Siberian component. 
Using another estimation approach you get a nonzero but lower Siberian
component in Basques, and almost none in Sardinians.

This last wave can only have come from a region that had both WHG-like
and ANE-like ancestry. That rules out the Middle East: they don’t have
WHG. You see quite a lot of ANE in the northeast Caucasus and the
northern Near East – the high is in Chechens and Lezgin.

All this is pointing to a big wave of genetic change around 3000 BC, a
wave that did not originate in the Near East (including Anatolia).
Perhaps the strongest hint is what they don’t say in this paper.
Although they mentioned such possibilities in an earlier related paper,
they make no mention of the Indo-Europeans. They don’t even use the
word *language* anywhere in the supplement. All this while they’re
clearly working out the origin and scope of the Indo-European invasion!

So they must have a paper in the works – one with strong conclusions, if
they’re that worried about someone scooping them. They were too obvious
– they need a course in maskirovka. They have got to be looking at
ancient DNA from relevant populations: from Kurgan burials, from Russia
north of the Caucasus, Tocharian mummies, etc. They’re going to need
strong evidence, and a baseball bat, to get linguists to pay attention.
Looks to me like we”re going to get at least half of the story (the
European end) of the Indo-European expansion out of this, and probably
we’ll learn something about Indo-Aryan end as well.

I will predict this: they’ll pussyfoot about the likely historical
process, which undoubtedly was awesomely bloody. The Balkans looks to be
where this started, and there a fairly sophisticated agricultural
population (with very advanced metallurgy for the time) seems to have
been utterly squished.
