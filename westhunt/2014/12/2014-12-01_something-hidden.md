something hidden

You’ve probably heard of Afrotheria. A line of placental mammals
expanded into all kinds of niches, back when Africa was an island
continent. Elephants, hyraxes, manatees, tenrecs, aardvarks, elephant
shrews, and golden moles are the existing members of Afrotheria. There
used to be more: things that looked like a rhino (*Arsenoitherium*),
for example. The thing is, they had diverged very far. Biologists had
realized that there was a relationship between elephants, hyraxes, and
manatees, but they didn’t know that aardvarks, tenrecs and golden moles
were in that same clade.  Without genetic analysis, it’s not easy to
see that an apparent mole is really more closely relayed to an elephant.
They’ve simply gotten too far into the part.

South America was also an island continent with its own placental
mammalian lineages, and some of them filled many different niches. One,
Xenarthra, has survivors: anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The
other, Meridiungulata, had members that looked like horses, camels,
rhinos, hippos, rabbits, even chalicotheres. Most lost out after the
formation of the isthmus of Panama let in North American competitors,
and Amerindians finished off the the last survivors ( like Maucrauchenia
and Toxodons) By the way, you will see South American paleontologists
defending the competence of their extinct fauna, making excuses for
their defeat by invaders from the North: it doesn’t get much stupider
than that.

I’m wondering of any of the Meridiungulata lineages did survive,
unnoticed because they’re passing for insectivores or rats or whatever,
just as tenrecs and golden moles did. . Obviously the big ones are
extinct, probably the others as well, but until we’ve looked at the DNA
of every little mammal in South America, the possibility exists.
