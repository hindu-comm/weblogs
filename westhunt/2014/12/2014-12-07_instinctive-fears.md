Instinctive Fears

It is easier to develop a phobia about snakes than electricity or carbon
monoxide, probably because we have built in neurological mechanism that
confer that propensity.

Likely most animals have a similar propensity to develop a fear of fire:
or it might come automatically. If there was such a fear-of-fire
mechanism, we have lost it: and dogs have as well. If this is correct,
one could learn about this hypothetical mechanism by comparing dogs and
wolves.
