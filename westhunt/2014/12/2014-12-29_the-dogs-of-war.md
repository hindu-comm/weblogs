The Dogs of War

There is reason to think that early Indo-Europeans had adolescent
war-bands, bands identified with dogs or wolves. It seems likely that
they were composed of boys about the same age , came from the wealthier
families, wore animal skins, and were sent off into border areas, where
they caused trouble. After a few years they rejoined regular society.

Passages in the Vedas suggest that there was a midwinter initiation
ritual in which these JDs died and were reborn as dogs of war. There are
lots of references to this sort of thing in Celtic, Germanic, and
Indo-Aryan legend and mythology.

Dorcas Brown and David Anthony report on the excavation of an late
Bronze Age settlement near Samara, Russia. They found evidence of a
winter-season sacrifice of many (> 50) dogs and wolves – not usually
eaten in these cultures. They were chopped into little, tiny pieces.,
especially the heads.

The animals were mostly over six years old and had been well treated:
Brown and Anthony suggest that they were pets, and that the boys had to
kill their own dogs as part of the initiation rite. That’s disgusting.
