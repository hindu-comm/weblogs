From the cutting room floor

“A haplotype (haploid genotype) is a particular pattern of variation
along a chromosome. Imagine three successive variable sites – the first
can be G or C (representing guanine or cytosine), the second can be A
(adenine) or G, while the third can be T (thymine) or C. A particular
individual might have C in the first site A in the second site, and T in
the third site – his haplotype would be CAT, while another person
(presumably Catalan) has the haplotype CGT. A haplotype is like a hand
of poker: the bases in the variable sites are like individual cards. ”  

Some of my jokes are obscure.
