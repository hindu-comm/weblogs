The Great IQ Depression

We hear that poverty can sap brainpower, reduce frontal lobe function,
induce the fantods, etc. But exactly what do we mean by ‘poverty’? If
we’re talking about an absolute, rather than relative, standard of
living, most of the world today must be in poverty, as well as almost
everyone who lived much before the present. Most Chinese are poorer
than the official US poverty level, right? The US had fairly rapid
economic growth until the last generation or so, so if you go very far
back in time, almost everyone was poor, by modern standards. Even those
who were considered rich at the time suffered from zero prenatal care,
largely useless medicine, tabletless high schools, and slow Internet
connections. They had to ride horses that had lousy acceleration and
pooped all over the place.

In particular, if all this poverty-gives-you-emerods stuff is true,
scholastic achievement should have collapsed in the Great Depression –
and with the miracle of epigenetics, most of us should *still* be
suffering those bad effects.

But somehow none of this seems to have gone through the formality of
actually happening.
