Genetic Architectures

Dairy cattle eventually graduate to McDonalds, so there is some interest
in the genetics of beef production in dairy breeds. There is course
more interest in the genetics of beef production in beef breeds of
cattle.

Usually you don’t find a single allele that makes a lot of difference,
but in some beef breeds, there are myostatin mutations that result in a
ridiculous-looking, ‘double-muscled’ beast. Homozygosity for myostatin
mutations causes difficulties in birth, so it takes really strong
selection for beef production to make a myostatin null common. I
don’t think you ever see this in dairy breeds.

But, as it turns out, there is a deletion that is pretty common in some
dairy breeds that significantly increases milk production while killing
homozygotes before birth.

Breeds under weaker selection for single traits, your typical cow of the
past, probably have neither.

The point is that the genetic architecture of a quantitative trait does
not have to be the same in different populations of the same species.
For example, I have the impression that height is not as highly
polygenic in Pygmies as it is most other human populations. There’s a
particular region on chromosome 3 that seems to influence height- you
don’t see such a concentration in Europeans.
