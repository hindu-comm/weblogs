It made their brown eyes blue..

A recent
[report](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/03/05/1316513111.abstract?tab=ds)[](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/03/05/1316513111.abstract?tab=ds)in
PNAS shows the inhabitants of the Ukraine and its environs had much
darker hair, skin, and eyes back in the Bronze Age and earlier.

Assuming population continuity, the selective advantage of the alleles
they examined must have been very high. In order to see if there had
been population continuity, they looked at the mtDNA frequencies of the
ancient populations and compared them with mtDNA frequencies of modern
populations in the same areas. Since they’re different, but not wildly
different, they conclude that there has been population continuity,
which was their null assumption.

That null assumption might have been reasonable, if someone had burned
every history book ever written, while at the same time suppressing all
the ancient DNA evidence.

Since that has not yet happened, I think their assumption is downright
embarrassing. People have been moving in and out of this area for all of
recorded history (as Razib Khan has also pointed out) : Cimmerians,
Scythians, Goths, Khazars, Kievian Rus, the Golden Horde, eventually
Russians.

There is no logical reason for geneticists to ignore information outside
their field. Ignorance is no excuse. I could say the same for every
other discipline. Cross the streams – it would be good.

Back on the original issue: there really has been a lot of change in the
European frequencies of alleles that influence skin, hair, and eye color
over the past few thousand years. Two population turnovers are a big
part of the story, but surely selection is as well. I don’t think we
can be sure of the underlying reasons – Vitamin D may not be all of the
story. Maybe not even most of the story.
