Archaic India

We know that archaic humans of some sort lived in India before
anatomically modern humans (AMH) arrived, probably for more than a
million years. But we know little about them, because we don’t have the
required fossils. Plenty of stone tools have been found, but the fossil
record is very meager.

India should have been a relatively friendly environment during the Ice
Age, at least compared to Europe, most of which was uninhabitable at the
glacial maximum. It could have sustained relatively large populations
(except after
[Toba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory), perhaps).
This seems to have been the case after occupation by AMH: mtDNA
diversity suggests fairly large populations during the last ice age.

So who were these archaics? Might have been Neaderthals. Maybe
Denisovans. Or, maybe, there was a hominid lineage there that had been
largely isolated for a long time. Indian is somewhat geographically
isolated today, but the degree of past isolation depends on past climate
patterns. I don’t know what the Thar Desert was like 20,000 years ago.

If India did have a significantly isolated archaic population, it would
not surprise me if we found evidence of admixture from that source in
modern people. There have been some calculations that suggest more
archaic admixture in Eurasians than is explained by known sources like
Neanderthals and Denisovans – India might be part of that story.
