Murder at Harvard

Naturally, we are interested in all things anthropological, and that
includes crime.

Jane Britton, a 23 year-old Harvard graduate student in anthropology,
was murdered on January 6th, 1969. Certain rites which had been
performed on the girl as she was dying were identified as part of an
ancient Persian burial ritual. They included sprinkling her body with
red ochre, and piling a coat, a rug and other similar articles on her
body in an attempt to simulate a burial. Police theorized that the
elaborate ceremony was probably performed by a person with extensive
knowledge of ancient civilizations â€“ particularly Persia. It was
described as an ancient symbolic method of purifying the body and
ridding it of evil spirits.

Police suspected that this crime was committed by someone in the
department of anthropology at Harvard.

Her death was caused by five blows on the back of the head with a
massive object. Police suspected that the object may have been an
archaeological fragment that she kept in her room, but as far as I know,
this was not confirmed.

There was no evidence of a struggle or robbery.

She had participated in excavations at Tepe Yahya (a site in Iran) in
1968:

The case has never been solved.
