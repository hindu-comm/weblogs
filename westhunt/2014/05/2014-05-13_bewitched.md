Bewitched

The Internet greatly facilitates contact between people with
complementary needs, but not all such opportunities have been realized.
In the spirit of Airbnb and Uber, I’d like to suggest another.

Dual-career couples, in both academia and the corporate world, have a
lot of trouble with transfers. Finding a comparable job for the spouse,
usually on short notice, ranges from difficult to impossible. But
there’s a better way!

When our generic urban professional moves from New York to Los Angeles,
we match him up with someone moving in the other direction, and they
then trade spouses, families, houses, and pets. As our service expands,
the possible matches get better. Eventually we can hope to achieve
decent approximate matches on spousal age and appearance, number and sex
of children, pet species, etc. For maximum ease of integration, everyone
acts as if nothing has changed, just as when Darrin, the husband in
Bewitched, suddenly stopped being Dick York and was replaced by Dick
Sargent, as if by magic.

The possibility of spousal/family upgrades surely exists, although
there would naturally be a substantial added fee.
