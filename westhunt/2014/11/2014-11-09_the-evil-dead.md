The Evil Dead

Someone asked me to go over a chapter he wrote, about the impact of
certain customs on human health. One of them was the health advantages
of quick burial: the problem is, usually there aren’t any. People seem
to think that the organisms causing decomposition are pathogenic, but
they’re not. People killed by trauma (earthquakes, floods, bullets)
are dead enough, but not a threat. Sometimes, the body of someone that
died of an infectious disease is contagious – smallpox scabs have been
known to remain infectious for a long, long time – but most causative
agents are unable to survive for long after the host’s death. Now if
you’re dissecting someone, especially if they’re fresh, you probably
don’t want to nick yourself with the scalpel – but if you just walk past
the corpse and refrain from playing with it, you’re usually OK.

In the past, it may have been a good idea to bury people quickly, so as
not to encourage a taste for human flesh in local predators, but that’s
a somewhat indirect risk

Someone asked Lewis Thomas about the health risks of unburied bodies,
with the intent of using a public-health threat as a legitimate reason
to break the undertaker’s strike in New York – but the threat just
wasn’t there. He said so, being an imperfectly political person.
