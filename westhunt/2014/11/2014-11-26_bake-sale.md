You can make non-deductible donations to Paypal (use the site button).
If you send a significant amount through PayPal and want deductibilty,
it can arranged, which would include a receipt.

If another donation method would be convenient for you, write me at

unconventional donations, such as doubloons, triploons, copies of [*The
Ocean*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) or *[On
