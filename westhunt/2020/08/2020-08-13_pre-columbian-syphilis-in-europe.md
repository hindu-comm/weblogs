Pre-Columbian syphilis in Europe

There’s an article out in Current Biology suggesting that syphilis may
already have existed in Europe before 1492 – mentioned in
[Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/medieval-dna-suggests-columbus-didn-t-trigger-syphilis-epidemic-europe).

They’re almost certainly wrong. Can you see why?
