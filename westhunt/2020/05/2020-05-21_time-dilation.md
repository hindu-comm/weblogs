Time Dilation

I’ve noticed that people’s sense of time, including my own, is all
messed up.

A comparison: in the US, the number of Cov-19 deaths has gone from about
300 to \~95,000 in two months.

The 1918 flu: First noticed on March 11, Fort Riley. Maybe a few hundred
deaths in the spring of 1918. Really took off in September (12,000
deaths) – six months later, not two.

It looks as if covid-19 has a higher R0 than 1918 influenza when allowed
to run free, while transportation and movement are considerably faster
today than in 1918.

The idea that it must not really be very infectious, since it has only
infected \~4% of the US in two months – not very infectious compared to
what?
