A somewhat similar case

Many people are not at work ( in lockdown) but some still are: health
workers, basic transportation and utility workers, farmers, food
providers. So the percentage off work is not 100%: maybe 80%?

I found a different, somewhat analogous case where an entire nation had
about 50% of its workers missing for a month. Can you guess where this
economic disaster occurred?
