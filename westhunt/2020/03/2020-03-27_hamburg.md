Hamburg

Claims that having a big fraction of the work force stay home for two or
three months ( to stifle Wuflu) would ruin the economy ( some say for a
generation ) , even though infrastructure and factories would be
intact, knowledge would not be lost, skills would not really have time
to deteriorate, few people would die ( the whole point of the exercise)
etc, etc – makes you wonder how the Germans managed to significantly
increase war production in 1943 while the Allies were dropping 200,000
tons of bombs on them, occasionally managing to burn whole cities to the
ground. Slavery helped, I guess. What can’t it do?
