Patents

In developing penicillin, in WWII, patents played little role, partly
because government process patents blocked most other possible patents.

“For corporations, the absence of restrictive patents eliminated
traditional barriers to sharing resources. As early as 1942, industrial
groups entered into agreements to exchange information and specimens
with one another. The first to do so were Merck and Squibb, joined a
year later by Pfizer. Later, the Midwest group—Eli Lilly, Abbott
Laboratories, Upjohn, and Parke, Davis—entered into a similar
arrangement for information exchange and reciprocal licensing on all
information pertaining to microbial cultures.”

Mandated cooperation on coronavirus between pharma and biotech firms
might could be a good thing. Maybe even academics could be induced to
share info. Even if intellectual property is usually a good thing in the
long run, it might be a bad thing in the current short run.
