No salvation in the denominator

As I mentioned
[before](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2020/03/26/oxford/), doofi at
Oxford have suggested that vast number of people have already
contracted coronavirus, and that the fraction of those infected that
become ill is thus much smaller than it looks. There was never any
chance of this. PCR positivity rates were not high, and in a
fast-growing epidemic, most cases would be new enough to be
PCR-positive.

Now, a new
[study](https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1245040612983713792) shows
that this notion is not correct. ” 164 close contacts tested by PCR and
serology. 16/164 of contacts PCR+ & all PCR+ also serology+. Additional
7/164 were serology+ but PCR-.”

There are some people that have contracted disease and don’t show up on
PCR – but not many.
