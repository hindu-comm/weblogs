Brains!  Brains!

One general factor that partially explains our ineffective approach to
Wuflu is that too many people in key jobs affecting our response – the
press, the medical research establishment, politicians, advisors –
aren’t all that smart.

We could draft all the particle physicists ( for the duration) . True,
most would not have a lot of specialized domain knowledge: it might
take two or three weeks before they were better at their new jobs than
typical CDC or WHO employees.
