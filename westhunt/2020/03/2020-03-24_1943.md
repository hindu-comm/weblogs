1943

In 1943, 1944, and 1945, the US put \~35% of GDP into war production,
which helped win the war but, in general, produced stuff that had very
little utility in civilian life. Judging by what some people are
saying, throwing away so much GDP should have significantly increased
the civilian death rate – but it did not. For that matter, the Great
Depression didn’t materially increase death rates.

1943-1945 should have tanked the economy and blasted health, according
to them, but that didn’t happen. Not even close.

Why not ?
