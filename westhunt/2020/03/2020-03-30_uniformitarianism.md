Uniformitarianism

Back when Luis and Walter Alvarez came up with their hypothesis that
the impact of a large asteroid ( or comet) caused the Cretaceous
extinction, most paleontologists didn’t like the idea – disliked the
very taste of the idea, regardless of evidence. They had been taught
that the key processes of evolution and geology were gradual – not just
that the same natural laws applied in the past as we see in the present
(true as far as we can tell) , but that the predominant processes
shaping the world and its life were (always !) generally similar to
those we see today. In large part, this was was motivated by opposition
to Biblical accounts of the Flood, etc. Catastrophism ( of any
flavor) was just wrong.

You could call them ‘base-raters’.

So there were reasons, what you might call philosophical and historical
reasons, for their dogged opposition to this new and highly catastrophic
theory. And have reading a number of books by prominent exponents of
the position, people like Charles Officer, Jake Page, Dewey McLean and
Gerta Keller, there was another factor:

They were quite stupid.
