Coding Error

James Coleman published an influential study in 1966, “Equality of
Educational Opportunity”. It found that variation in school quality (per
pupil expenditure, size of school library, and so on) had little
influence on educational achievement, while students’ family
backgrounds did. Which is consistent with genetic influences.

He did find that a student’s educational attainment was related to that
of other students in the school – somehow, educational success rubbed
off on others. This was often cited as evidence to support policies of
forced integration and busing.

But that finding was a mistake – due to a coding error. Which I first
thought meant missing a parenthesis in some computer program, but more
likely had to do with mislabeling or misclassifying entered data.
