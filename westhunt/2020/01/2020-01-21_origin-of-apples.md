Origin of apples

There are a number of species of apple trees, but it looks as the
cultivated varieties mainly originated in Kazakhstan, while wild apples
are very similar to cultivated varieties. In particular, they’re larger
than other undomesticated species.

It has been suggested that these particular apples were selected for
large fruits because their seeds were efficiently transmitted to
hospitable dung piles in this manner – because bears shit in the woods.
