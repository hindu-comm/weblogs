Blood Will Tell

Most psychological traits are significantly, although not
overwhelmingly, heritable. So if you are given information about the
psychology of close relatives of some person, you know more than you did
before about that person. On average. If his kids, sibs, parents are all
extremely smart ( or extremely dumb, or extremely crazy), you have a
better estimate of his true nature than you did in the absence of that
information about relatives. For that matter, group membership will
also alter your estimate, if the two groups in question are fairly
different. In some cases, it can make a big difference: if someone
tells you that a Pygmy is 6′ 6″ ( and not a pituitary case) you would
assign that a very low probability.
