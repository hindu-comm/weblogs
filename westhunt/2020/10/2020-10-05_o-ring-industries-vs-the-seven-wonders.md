O-Ring Industries vs the Seven Wonders.

O-Ring industries are ones in which a number of interrelated tasks must
*all* be completed successfully – ones in which a moderate increase in
workers’ skills greatly increases the probability of success. The idea
was originated by Kremer, and further developed by Jones. It helps
explain why the richest, smartest countries produce entirely different,
much more sophisticated ( and profitable) goods than the poorest,
dumbest countries – because they can.

It strikes me that maximally-complexity O-ring-type projects might be
serve as an index of a society’s capabilities – something like the Seven
Wonders of the ancient world, but a better measure. This tells you
something different from peaks of individual intellectual
accomplishment.

So, Boeing and Airbus jets are pretty O-Ringish. Same for jet fighters
and nuclear submarines. CERN and LIGO certainly qualify. Jack Parson’s
Lab is a steady producer.  Modern computer chips are good examples, as
are operating systems.

What were the O-Ring Wonders in 1500? ? 1 AD?
