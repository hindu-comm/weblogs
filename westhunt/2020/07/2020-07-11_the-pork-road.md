The Pork Road

It now seems clear, from genetic evidence, that Polynesians from the
Marquesas visited the western coast of the Americas – somewhere ( or
maybe several places) between Peru and Mexico.

But what paid the freight? Why did they do it, and, I would guess, keep
doing it for some time? It’s feasible, but it’s a long voyage, not
without risk. And interacting with strangers has its own risks, not
least when you’re a bunch of warlike cannibals. Taboos get broken.

The Polynesians needed something to trade that was highly valued by the
Amerinds & could not be easily duplicated by them. They had some
different crops, but nobody likes taro or breadfruit all that much,
while the Amerinds had plenty of crops of their own. High-tech
exports? The Polynesians didn’t have anything really impressive other
than their outrigger canoes.

But they had pigs, and the Amerindians did not. Imagine that sharp
Polynesians traded pigs for various valuata ( cornmeal, manioc, sweet
potatoes, chocolate, maybe decorative metal objects) .

Male pigs. The Polynesians, being a bit more sophisticated than
contemporary Ivy League graduates, understood that generating piglets
requires both boars and sows. Actual, biological, males and females:
identification is not enough.

If you only trade boars, the market lasts indefinitely . American
chieftains involved in this trade could have offered their high-ranking
followers ***bacon***. Trade continues until people get tired of it,
and of course that never happens.
