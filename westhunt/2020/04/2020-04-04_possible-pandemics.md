Possible Pandemics

In the past, serious infectious diseases were spread in several
qualitatively different ways: by arthropod vectors like mosquitoes or
fleas (malaria and bubonic plague) , via contaminated water like cholera
or typhoid, sexually (syphilis and AIDS), and via respiratory
transmission ( smallpox, measles, influenza). We are perfectly able
to stop everything but respiratory transmission. With the right
technical developments, we could eliminate that last possibility.
