Viral Dose

If starting out with a high viral dose makes a difference, that must
play out pretty rapidly, since an infected cell tends to produce
somewhere between many and a shitload of new virions. Influenza A and B
produce 500-100 in chicken egg cells, HIV produces 1000-3000, SIV
produces 40,000-60,000.

Influenza can go from infecting a cell to releasing those 500-1000 new
copies in six hours.
