Learning from Wuflu

Every crisis is also an opportunity. In this case, we get to learn how
people respond, under pressure, to a situation that ( for most) is very
new. Generally quite badly: most people show very bad judgment. But
to what degree is this new information? Mostly not: Most of the people
responding with nonsense ( of those I’m familiar with) were already
obvious loons. But then, I think that of so very many people.

A question: I was thinking of one particular current marker of
stupidity, the notion that in a population with an at-birth life
expectancy of 80, someone 79 has one year to live. Obviously that is
very stupid, in an absolute sense – but what percentile stupid is it?
Would the bottom 50% of the population make that mistake? The bottom
90%? The bottom 99%?

The world wonders. At least I do.
