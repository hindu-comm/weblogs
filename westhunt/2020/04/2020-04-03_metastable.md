Metastable

YOu can imagine a situation where R0 \< 1, but only due to a strategy
that includes some methods that only work when the absolute number of
infected people is low. Something like fighting fires in California
brush: everythingâ€™s flammable, potentially you could have a big fire,
but as long as you run around quickly putting out little fires ( before
they spread) you can prevent it. But if there are too many little fires,
the one-armed paperhanger effect kicks in and things get out of control.

In such a metastable situation, controlling the number of visitors could
be important.

Now if R0 is well under 1.0, and that is all due to strategies that
have no problem scaling up, a few infected visitors is an annoyance but
not a big threat.
