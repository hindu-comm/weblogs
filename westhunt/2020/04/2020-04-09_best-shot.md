Best Shot

People are looking at many potential therapies for Wuflu, as they
should. However, the chance that any particular existing drug will be
effective against coronavirus is not very high.

I know one approach for which success is actually likely ( \> 50% chance
of success) : serum therapies, also known as [passive antibody
therapy](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro974). that approach has
worked on a very wide spectrum of infectious diseases, such as
pneumococcal pneumonia, group A streptococci, hepatitis B, measles,
RSV, and Ebola (far from a complete list). Itâ€™s being tried right
now, with encouraging results.
