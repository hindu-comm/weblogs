Son of low-hanging fruit

In yet another example of long-delayed discovery, forms of
high-altitude lightning were observed for at least a century before
becoming officially real (as opposed to really real).

Some thunderstorms manage to generate blue jets shooting out of their
thunderheads, or glowing red rings and associated tentacles around 70
kilometers up. C T R Wilson predicted this long ago, back in the
1920s. He had a simple model that gets you started.

You see, you can think of the thunderstorm, after a ground discharge,
as a vertical dipole. Its electrical field drops as the cube of
altitude. The threshold voltage for atmospheric breakdown is
proportional to pressure, while pressure drops *exponentially* with
altitude: and as everyone knows, a negative exponential drops faster
than any power.

The curves must cross. Electrical breakdown occurs. Weird lightning,
way above the clouds.

As I said, people reported sprites at least a hundred years ago, and
they have probably been observed occasionally since the dawn of time.
However, they’re far easier to see if you’re above the clouds – pilots
often do.

Pilots also learned not to talk about it, because nobody listened. 
Military and commercial pilots have to pass periodic medical exams known
as ‘flight physicals’, and there was a suspicion that reporting glowing
red cephalopods in the sky might interfere with that. Generally, you
had to see the things that were officially real (whether they were
really real or not), and only those things.

Sprites became real when someone recorded one by accident on a fast
camera in 1989. Since then it’s turned into a real subject, full of
strangeness: turns out that thunderstorms sometimes generate gamma-rays
and even antimatter.

Presumably we’ve gotten over all that ignoring your lying eyes stuff by
now.
