Reconstruction

[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mongol-star.jpg?w=640&h=828 "mongol star")](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mongol-star.jpg)

There’s a cluster of Y-chromosomes found in inner Eurasia that vary only
slightly, and thus must have a recent common ancestor. They are
surprisingly common: there are something like 16 million carriers. The
analysts who discovered this (Zerjal et al) concluded the men with these
Y-chromosomes are the direct male-line descendants of Genghis Khan, the
Master of Thrones and Crowns. They have to be right: no one else
conquered such a vast empire and had his sons (and their sons, and so
on) rule and enjoy their harems for centuries. More than that, the
Golden Family continued to have high social status long after the fall
of the dynasties, even into recent times.

Since power descended through the male line, you don’t expect to see the
same thing happen with autosomal genes. Genghis accounts for about 25%
of Mongolia’s Y-chromosomes, but the general ancestry fraction
attributable to him must be a lot lower. Still, what if the average
Mongol today is 0.5% Genghis? Upon sequencing lots of typical
contemporary Mongols, you would notice certain chromosomal segments
showing up again and again: not just in one family but in the whole
country, and in other parts of inner Asia as well. If you started
keeping track of those segments, you would eventually be able to make a
partial reconstruction of Genghis’s genome. It would be incomplete,
since any given region of the genome might have missed being transmitted
to any of his four legitimate sons (Jochi, Chagatai, Ogedei, and
Tolui). They certainly didn’t carry his X-chromosome. You might be
able to distinguish the autosomal genes of Genghis and his wife Borte by
looking at descendants of his by-blows, if you could find them. Still,
even if you managed to retrieve 75% of his genome, that’s not enough to
make a clone. It would however, allow sure identification if we found
his tomb.

And since he’s likely buried in permafrost, his DNA could be in good
shape. Then we *could* clone him (assuming reasonable continuing
progress in genetics) and of course some damn fool would. Will.
