Gauge Transformation

As a reader pointed out, you don’t need to to have a flypaper memory to
be a physicist. There you can go a long way with a few basic facts and
a long chain of mathematical reasoning. You can see that the equation
of state is going to go soft when things turn relativistic, and suddenly
the star collapses. Whee!

But many subjects are not like that. Understanding, to the extent that
it is possible at all, requires mastery of many facts. Consider
Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. More than three million
Germans invaded, with hundreds of thousands of motor vehicles and even
more *horses*. The Germans had the initiative and were tactically
superior: the Russians had greater numbers and resources, if they could
survive long enough to bring them into play. The Germans had to win
quickly, if they were to win at all.

Modern armies require enormous amounts of supply, mostly gas and ammo.
In those days, supply mainly meant railroads. In Germany, and in most of
Europe, the separation between the rails, the rail gauge, was 1,435 mm
(4ft 8 1/2 in). So when the Germans invaded France, they could
immediately make use of the French railnet. In Russia, the Germans
faced a problem: the gauge was different, 1528 mm (5 ft). German
locomotives could not use those tracks until they had been converted.
As Pravda used to say, this was no coincidence: it is thought that the
Czarist government made this choice for defensive reasons.

It was difficult for a WWII-style army to operate for any length of time
when more than 100 km from a rail head or port. After the initial
lunge, the Germans could not advance faster than the rate of gauge
conversion. Maybe they couldn’t find enough railway engineers. Maybe
Hitler thought his unconquerable will could trump mere logistics. Maybe
the Wehrmacht high command underestimated the difficulty of working in
the rasputitsa and the Russian winter. Whatever the reason, they
couldn’t rebuild the railroads fast enough to take Moscow in 1941.

You can’t really understand the War in the East without understanding
rail gauges – assuming a spherical Soviet Union is not the way to go.
