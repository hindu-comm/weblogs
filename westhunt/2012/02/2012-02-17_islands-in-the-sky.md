Islands in the sky

There are three major high-altitude regions inhabited by humans:
highland Ethiopia, Tibet, and the Andean altiplano. In each of these
three cases, the locals have adapted in various ways to high altitude –
physiological adaptations, as well as cultural. To make it even clearer,
those physiological changes are, to a large extent, a consequence of
natural selection, rather than individual acclimatization.

There are several recent papers on the genetic basis of human adaptation
to high altitude-, and they clearly show that natural selection has
taken a different path in each of these populations. This was obvious
even before the sequencing started: Andean Amerindians are
barrel-chested and have high levels of hemoglobin, while Tibetans pant
at the drop of a hat but don’t have particularly high levels of
hemoglobin. Moreover, the Tibetan adaptive response works better. Very
few Tibetans get chronic mountain sickness, but a significant fraction
of Andean highlanders do, especially with increasing age. Tibetan
babies are significantly plumper than Andean babies. There are hints
that the Ethiopian pattern may also be more effective than the Andean,
but that hasn’t been studied as much.

Overall, as Cynthia Beall has pointed out, the Tibetan pattern is
closer to that seen in animal species that have lived at high altitude
for long periods of time.

Rasmus Nielsen concluded the changes in Tibetans happened over about
3,000 years. I doubt that. People have probably been in the altiplano
longer than that, and yet their adaptations are substantially less
effective.

Hominids have lived in or near Ethiopia and Tibet for much, much longer
than anyone has lived in the New World – something like 100 times
longer. It is possible that the populations of modern humans living in
those areas picked up some altitude-friendly alleles from archaic humans
that had lived at high altitude for a very long time – and naturally had
more effective adaptations. It only takes a tiny bit of admixture to
transmit beneficial alleles. We now have some probable examples of
such transmission: it looks as if some archaic HLA alleles (Neanderthal
and Denisovan) have reached high frequency in Eurasians, while a very
divergent Denisovan version of OAS1, a innate immune gene, is common in
Melanesians.

We can be sure that the Andean Indians did not have this opportunity,
since humans have only been in the New World for 15,000 years or so. No
llama jokes, please.
