Presidential Transportation



There has been, over the past couple of generations, a gradual tendency
for the Presidency to acquire power and the trappings of power to an
almost Imperial extent. CertainlyPresidential transportation is one of
the most spectacular examples: having two of your own superbly and
specially-equipped 747s is not going to make you humble. Air Force One
has become a prime symbol of presidential power and prestige.

 Well, that kind of Presidential power and prestige is
fundamentally un-American. It’s bad symbolism: bad for the Republic,
bad for Presidential mental health. President are our servants, not our
masters, andthey should never be allowed to forget it. I am reminded
of the agent who was visiting a British-owned cattle ranch in Wyoming
back in 1890 and asked a cowboy“if his *master* was in”. The cowboy
replied: “The bastard hasn’t even been born yet.”

 POTUS needs his wings clipped.  We need to make sure that
the President knows who the boss is – us. I have a bracing
alternative strategy in mind, one that also shows the proper spirit of
austerity.

     First, ditch the 747s. Ground transportation was good
enough for George Washington and it’s plenty good enough for lesser
Presidents. I think that we should replace the big birds witha
garbage truck: – armored, naturally, for security –the modern kind of
garbage truck that automatically picks up a garbage can and dumps it .
The Secret Service would prepare the Prez for travel by gently inserting
him into the official White House trash can – head first, so that he
could be safely decanted into thesoftly yielding garbage in the back of
the truck. The method would be the same for White House staff and the
press, except that inthose cases, we could put several
staffers/reporters in the garbage can at a time. This may unduly favor
the President, but hey, RHIP. Perhaps we could modify the truck so that
it can accept garbage from the left and right simultaneously, speeding
the loading process.

 There would of course typically be garbage in the back since
it would be silly to let the truck just sit idly inbetween Presidential
expeditions – zoo excrement and medical waste don’t haul themselves,
you know.

 Some may object that such travel conditions might soil
clothes and impart the pure odor of politics – well, if there are any
complaints, we can always (upon arrival) turn the fire hose on the Prez
and his minions. Perhaps we could add acharacteristic colorful dye
that would help people identify the Presidential party – this would
allow voters to be absolutely surethat thesepeople were really the
President andhis merry men, rather some traveling set of gypsies or
mummers.

This approach isn’t just good politics – it’s ecologically
sound. We save fossil fuels, of course – the truck’s diesel engine
would run onbiofuel produced from restaurant grease and slaughterhouse
carrion. But there’s more –flattened fauna found along the freeway –
cooked on top of the engine block ( by the White House chef, natch –
those French sauces can be poured over *anything) –* should allow the
party to live off the land.
