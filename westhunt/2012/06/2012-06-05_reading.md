Reading

Reading speed and comprehension interest me, but I don’t have as much
information as I would like. I would like to see the distribution of
reading speeds ( in the general population, and also in college
graduates). I have looked a bit at discussions of this, and there’s
something wrong. Or maybe a lot wrong. Researchers apparently say that
nobody reads 900 words a minute with full comprehension, but I’ve seen
it done. I would also like to know if anyone has statistically
validated methods that increase reading speed.

On related topics, I wonder how many serious readers there are, here
and also in other countries. Are they as common in Japan or China, with
their very different scripts? Are reading speeds higher or lower
there?

How many people have their houses really, truly stuffed with books?
Here and elsewhere? Last time I checked we had about 5000 books around
the house: I figure that’s serious, verging on the pathological.

To what extent do people remember what they read? Judging from the
general results of adult knowledge studies, not very much of what they
took in school, but maybe voluntary reading is different.
