Wizard War

Partly because it has some interesting examples of thick and thin
problems, but mostly because it’s so damn much fun, I’m going to talk
about *The Wizard War*, by R. V. Jones.

Reginald Jones (Ph.D. Oxford, 1934)was one of the first scientists to
work for an intelligence service. He investigated German radio
navigational systems and developed various methods of interfering with
them, which often involved projecting the German’s next move in the
electronic war. He was one of the developers of ‘chaff’, and also
served as an expert consultant on the development of German rocketry –
mainly the V-2.

Some of his successes were classically thin, as when he correctly
analyzed the German two-beam navigation system (Knickebein). He realize
that the area of overlap of two beams could be narrow, far narrower than
suggested by the Rayleigh criterion.

During the early struggle with the Germans, the “Battle of the Beams”,
he personally read all the relevant Enigma messages. They piled up on
his desk, but he could almost always pull out the relevant message,
since he remembered the date, which typewriter it had been typed on, and
the kind of typewriter ribbon or carbon. When asked, he could usually
pick out the message in question in seconds. This system was
deliberate: Jones believed that the larger the field any one man could
cover, the greater the chance of one brain connecting two facts – the
classic approach to a ‘thick’ problem, not that anyone seems to know
that anymore.

All that information churning in his head produced results, enough so
that his bureaucratic rivals concluded that he had some special unshared
source of information. They made at least three attempts to infiltrate
his Section to locate this great undisclosed source. An officer from
Bletchley Park was offered on a part-time basis with that secret
objective. After a month or so he was called back, and assured his
superiors that there was no trace of anything other than what they
already knew. When someone asked ‘Then how does Jones do it? ‘ he
replied ‘Well, I suppose, Sir, he thinks!’
