Megafaunal Extinctions

When competent human hunters encountered naive fauna, the biggest
animals, things like mammoths and toxodons and diprotodons, all went
extinct. It is not hard to see why this occurred. Large animals are
more worth hunting than rabbits, and easier to catch, while having a far
lower reproductive rate. Moreover, humans are not naturally narrow
specialists on any one species, so are not limited by the abundance of
that species in the way that the lynx population depends on the hare
population. Being omnivores, they could manage even when the megafauna
as a whole were becoming rare.

There were subtle factors at work as well: the first human colonists in
a new land probably didn’t develop ethnic/language splits for some time,
which meant that the no-mans-land zones between tribes that can act as
natural game preserves didn’t exist in that crucial early period. Such
game preserves might have allowed the megafauna to evolve better
defenses against humans – but they never got the chance.

It happened in the Americas, in Australia, in New Zealand, in
Madagascar, and in sundry islands. There is no reason to think that
climate had much to do with it, except in the sense that climatic change
may sometimes have helped open up a path to those virgin lands in which
the hand of man had never set foot, via melting glaciers or low sea
level.

I don’t know the numbers, but certainly a large fraction of
archeologists and paleontologists, perhaps a majority, don’t believe
that human hunters were responsible, or believe that hunting was only
one of several factors. Donald Grayson and David Meltzer, for example.
Why do they think this?  In part I think it is an aversion to simple
explanations, a reversal of Ockham’s razor, which is common in these
fields. Of course then I have to explain why they would do such a silly
thing, and I can’t. Probably some with these opinions are specialists
in a particular geographic area, and do not appreciate the power of
looking at multiple extinction events: it’s pretty hard to argue that
the climate just happened to change whenever people showed when it
happens five or six times.

It might be that belief in specialization is even more of a problem than
specialization itself. Lots of time you have to gather insights and
information from several fields to make progress on a puzzle. It seems
to me that many researchers aren’t willing to learn much outside their
field, even when it’s the only route to the answer. But then, maybe
they *can’t*. I remember an anthropologist who could believe in humans
rapidly filling up New Zealand, which is about the size of Colorado, but
just couldn’t see how they could have managed to fill up a whole
continent in a couple of thousand years. Evidently she didn’t
understand geometric growth. She is not alone. I have see
anthropologists argue \[The revolution that wasn’t\] that increased
human density in ancient Africa was driven by the continent ‘finally
getting full’, rather than increased intellectual abilities and
resulting greater technological sophistication. That’s truly silly.
Look, back in those days, technology changed slowly: you would hardly
notice significant change over 50k years. Human populations grow far
faster than that, given the chance. Imagine a population with three
surviving children per couple, which is nothing special: it would grow
by a factor of ten million in a thousand years. The average long-term
growth rate was very low, but that is because the rate of increase in
human capabilities, which determine the carrying capacity, was very slow
– not because rapid population growth is difficult or impossible.

I could explain this to my 11-year old twins in five minutes, but I
don’t know that I could ever explain it to Brooks and McBrearty.
