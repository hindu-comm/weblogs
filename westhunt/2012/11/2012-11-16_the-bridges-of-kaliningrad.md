The Bridges of Kaliningrad

I showed my small son Sam the Bridges of Königsberg
problem:[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/konigsberg_bridges1.png?w=640 "Konigsberg_bridges")](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/konigsberg_bridges1.png)

The problem is to find a walk through the city that crosses each bridge
once and only once. Turns out that this is impossible: I told Sam, but
he kept trying anyhow. He ended up pretty frustrated. Later, over
supper, I told him that Königsberg was now a Russian city called
Kaliningrad – that it had been captured in WWII, in a vast assault
involving thousands of tanks (3rd Belorussian Front). Sam, assuming the
Soviet motives were the same as his, pointed out that they only really
needed to have blown up one bridge.
