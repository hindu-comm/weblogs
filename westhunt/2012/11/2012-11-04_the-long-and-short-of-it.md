The long and short of it

A number of people have argued that there can’t be real evolutionary
change in less than some huge amount of time – 50k years, 100k years,
basically whatever number they need to win an argument. That’s all
bullshit. On the other hand, some people seem to think that you can get
a lot of change in one generation without particularly trying. That,
too, is bullshit.

When someone suggests that evolutionary change is the reason that
behavior X or trait Y has changed noticeably (in a particular
population) since the 1950s – they’re wrong. Roland Fryer has argued
that the rigors of the Middle Passage selected for salt sensitivity in
African-Americans. But he’s for-sure wrong. First, there is no
evidence that a higher-than-average tendency to hold on to salt would
make much difference in someone’s chance of survival on a slave ship.
Lots of the mortality had nothing to do with salt retention: why would
it protect you against smallpox or pneumonia? Second, even if there
was, it wouldn’t have a huge effect, partly because mortality on slave
ships wasn’t that high – around 15% in the 17th century, not that much
higher than among immigrants from Europe in that period (\~10%). If they
lost the bottom 15% of the people (in ways related to salt retention)
during the Middle Passage, a cutoff of about one std below average, the
increase in salt retention would be about a tenth of a standard
deviation, assuming a narrow-sense heritability of 50%. You’d never
notice the difference.

Along the same lines, Charles Murray, in an essay in Commentary,
explains higher-than-average IQs among the Jewish people as a whole (not
just among the Ashkenazim) as caused in part by the exile to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzzar “carried into exile all Jerusalem: all the officers and
fighting men, and all the craftsmen and artisans… only the poorest
people of the land were left” (2 King 24:10). Murray suggests that this
group was an elite, and that later the Jews were largely descended from
returned exiles. First, non-Ashkenazi Jews do not even have
higher-than-average IQs. There is not much reason to think that they
ever did. Certainly no one in Classical times ever had that impression.

Second, if you take along the army and all the potters and shoemakers,
they’ll way outnumber anyone you could call an intellectual elite – it’s
not a strong selective event.. Third, we have no reason to believe
that most of the ancestry of the Jews in Israel in, say, Roman times was
primarily from returned exiles. It certainly can’t be true today: about
half of Ashkenazi ancestry is actually European, probably Italian as
much as anything else. Sephardic Jews are also around half-European,
although those were probably different Europeans.

In using an ancient and poorly-documented possibly-selective
one-generation event as an explanation of a general phenomenon which
does not even exist, Murray makes Fryer look like a genius. By
comparison only, because Fryer’s argument has zero chance.

How much could IQ have changed, since the 1950s, due to selection? 2
points would be a stretch. Now replacement of one population by another
can happen in that time, certainly locally, and then you may be
comparing populations that have been subject to different selective
pressures for as much as a hundred thousand years. They can be as
different as all get out. I know of actual live people who are
convinced that the schools in Brooklyn have gone to hell, since the
black and Hispanic kids of today seem to be doing so much worse
academically than the Jewish kids of yesteryear. Really. They think
that.

Selection changing IQ at half a point a generation can happen – is
happening – and can create big, interesting differences in a thousand
years. But we must remind everyone that 1000 is considerably bigger
than 25: it is right to worry about what happens if this goes on, but
it is numerically incorrect to pretend that all that much has actually
happened so far within populations, since the birth of effective
medicine, the welfare state, feminism, or whatever trend you’re worried
about.
