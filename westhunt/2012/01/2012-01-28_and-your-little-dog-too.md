And your little dog, too!

As I have mentioned before, the mtDNA of European hunter-gathers seems
to be very different from that of modern Europeans. The ancient European
mtDNA pool was about 80% U5b – today that lineage is typically found at
10% frequency or lower, except in northern Scandinavia. Haplogroup H,
currently the most common in Europe, has never been found in early
Neolithic or pre-Neolithic Europeans. Less has been done with ancient
Y-chromosomal DNA, but the data we have suggests that the lineages that
were common in the early Neolithic and pre-Neolithic are rare today.
R1b is the most common y-chromosomal haplotype today in Western Europe:
it has never been found in Neolithic or pre-Neolithic Europeans. We
find G2 in the early Neolithic: today it is rare, except in Sardinia and
some mountainous regions of Italy and Sicily. It sure looks as if we’re
talking near-complete replacement – which means that the historical
process involved does not look much like a peaceful, diffusion-style
range expansion. Perhaps more like the Death Song of Ragnar Lodbrok,
which abounds in phrases like this: “Where the swords were whining while
they sundered helmets”

Interestingly, there is a very similar pattern in canine mtDNA. Today
Europeans dogs fall into four haplotypes: A (70%), B(16%), C (6%), and
D(8%). But back in the day, it seems that the overwhelming majority of
dogs (88%) were type C, 12% were in group A, while B and D have not
been detected at all.

The ancestors of today’s Europeans didn’t fool around.
