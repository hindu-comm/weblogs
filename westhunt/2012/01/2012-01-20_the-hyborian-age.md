The Hyborian Age

I was contemplating Conan the Barbarian, and remembered the essay that
Robert E. Howard wrote about the background of those stories – The
Hyborian Age. I think that the flavor of Howard’s pseudo-history is a
lot more realistic than the picture of the human past academics
preferred over the past few decades.

In Conan’s world, it’s never surprising to find a people that once mixed
with some ancient prehuman race. Happens all the time. Until very
recently, the vast majority of workers in human genetics and
paleontology were sure that this never occurred – and only changed their
minds when presented with evidence that was both strong (ancient DNA)
and too mathematically sophisticated for them to understand or challenge
(D-statistics).

Conan’s history was shaped by the occasional catastrophe. Most
academics (particularly geologists) don’t like catastrophes, but they
have grudgingly come to admit their importance – things like the Thera
and Toba eruptions, or the K/T asteroid strike and the Permo-Triassic
crisis.

Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the
sons of Aryas, evolution seems to have run pretty briskly, but without
any pronounced direction. Men devolved into ape-men when the
environment pushed in that direction (Flores ?) and shifted right back
when the environment favored speech and tools. Culture shaped
evolution, and evolution shaped culture. An endogamous caste of
snake-worshiping priests evolved in a strange direction. Although their
IQs were considerably higher than average, they remained surprisingly
vulnerable to sword-bearing barbarians.

In this world, evolution could happen on a time scale of thousands of
years, and there was no magic rule that ensured that the outcome would
be the same in every group. It may not be PC to say it, but Cimmerians
were smarter than Picts.

Above all, people in Conan’s world fought. They migrated: they invaded.
There was war before, during, and after civilization. Völkerwanderungs
were a dime a dozen. Conquerors spread. Sometimes they mixed with the
locals, sometimes they replaced them – as when the once dominant
Hyborians, overrun by Picts, vanished from the earth, leaving scarcely a
trace of their blood in the veins of their conquerors. They must have
been U5b.

To be fair, real physical anthropologists in Howard’s day thought that
there had been significant population movements and replacements in
Europe, judging from changes in skeletons and skulls that accompanied
archeological shifts, as when people turned taller, heavier boned , and
brachycephalic just as the Bell-Beaker artifacts show up. But those
physical anthropologists lost out to people like Boas – liars.

Given the chance (sufficient lack of information), American
anthropologists assumed that the Mayans were peaceful astronomers.
Howard would have assumed that they were just another blood-drenched
snake cult: who came closer?

Now I’m not saying that Howard got every single tiny little syllable of
prehistory right. Not likely: so far, we haven’t seen any signs of
Cthulhu-like visitors, which abound in the Conan stories. So far. But
Howard’s priors were more accurate than those of the pots-not-people
archeologists: more accurate than people like Excoffier and Currat, who
assume that there hasn’t been any population replacement in Europe since
moderns displaced Neanderthals. More accurate than Chris Stringer, more
accurate than Brian Ferguson.

Most important, Conan, unlike the typical professor, knew what was best
in life.
