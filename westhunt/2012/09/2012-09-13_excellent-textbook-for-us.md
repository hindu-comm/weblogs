Excellent Textbook for Us

Trying to understand how to use and apply Hamilton’s theory of
senescence to understanding our old Herero material, I asked my
colleague Alan Rogers for a suggestion. He suggested his own
[textbook](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~rogers/ant5471/Rogers-textbook.pdf "Rogers' Evolutionary Ecology Text")
written for his course on evolutionary ecology.

It is a marvel. If you want to catch up on life history theory read
chapter 16, “Life History Evolution”, starting on page 114. And, the
price is right.
