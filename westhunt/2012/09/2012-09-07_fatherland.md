Fatherland

Some have suggested that societies or states can usefully be thought of
as a superorganism, rather like a beehive. States respond,
semi-intelligently, to opportunities and threats. They defend
themselves. They store and make use of information. We may believe that
they’re not ‘real’ entities, but then maybe our neurons and our gut
flora think the same of us.

This perspective might help us understand United States foreign policy,
which generally seems totally gormless. We seem determined to do
expensive and useless things. But there may be a biological analogy.
Maybe the Iraq War, or our government’s immigration policies, are the
equivalent of the peacock’s tail – a case of Zahavi’s handicap
principle. Only a *true* superpower could get away with acting this
stupid. Of course, this usually applies to sexual selection. No country
would want to mate with an inferior nation that can’t afford to produce
such wastefully extravagant signals.

All of this implies that mating is on the superorganism’s mind. I think
that this line of analysis has one clear implication: stay the hell out
of Florida.
