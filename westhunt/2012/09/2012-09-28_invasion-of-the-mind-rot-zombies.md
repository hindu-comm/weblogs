Invasion of the Mind Rot Zombies

Anyone who works at a university, attends a university, has children at
university, and so on must go to the
[website](http://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/index.cfm)of the
Association of American Colleges and Universities, sign in, and download
their packet of “VALUE rubrics.” You get fifteen of them, identified on
each page as a “metarubric” rather than a “rubric.” VALUE, by the way,
stands for “Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education”.

These are page after page after page of platitudes and doubletalk to be
used by accreditation agencies to evaluate universities, or so it seems.
Look them over and you will either sob in despair else roll on the
floor laughing at those of us subject to these kinds of people. Recall
the edubabble your children occasionally brought home from middle
school: here it is dressed up in new clothes in all its glory.

This stuff makes everyone at Dilbert look like a serious rational actor.
Universities seem uniquely incapable of resising parasite infection,
and this VALUE stuff is a new low. Help us please.
