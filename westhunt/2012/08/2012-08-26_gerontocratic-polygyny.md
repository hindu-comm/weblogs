Gerontocratic polygyny

Significant differences in paternal age can make a big difference in the
mutation rate. If maintained for a long time, thousands of years, this
would also cause significant differences in total mutational load. For
example, the average paternal age in Iceland in 1980 was 28, which would
mean 56 new mutations per generation. For Australian Aborigines, which
have a very unusual pattern in which fathers are about 14 years older
than mothers, the average paternal age was 42.6, which would mean 85.2
mutations per generation – a 57.5% higher mutation rate. If that
pattern persisted for a long time, the high-mutation population would
have a much higher genetic load. ***Every*** member of that
high-mutation population would have considerably more genetic errors
than individuals in a population that had experienced that low Iceland
rate for a long time. You would expect that this extra genetic burden
would reduce brain efficiency, but you would also expect to see lots of
other health problems, surely resulting in reduced lifespan.

I think that Australian aborigines may have had this pattern for a long
time. The rest of the world has changed more rapidly. I know that
paternal age in Iceland is higher today (33) than it was in 1980, and
that it appears to have been as high or higher in the 17th and 18th
centuries. But I don’t what the average pattern was over the past few
thousand years.

I think this means that the differences in genetic load recently seen
between European/East Asian and African populations are not
particularly surprising. Particular social paths/ ecological
situations can have large long-term genetic impacts, impacts that no
one involved could foresee.
