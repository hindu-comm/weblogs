A Start of Semester Quiz

I often post about Herero, southern African Bantu-speaking ranchers. I
plan to continue because they are prosperous people with strong families
and little crime or disorder. They also defy western definitions of
things like marriage, family, male investment, and so on. My purpose in
these posts is to describe this matrilineal society that works because
much of the left end of the SES distribution in the US seems to be
following the same social development. Perhaps there are lessons from
the Herero that as citizens we should understand.

But nothing so serious today: this is just for fun. I am posting a
quiz. I can’t offer my voice on your answering machine for the first
correct answer, but that answer will certainly receive praise and
applause from our audience. Tune in tomorrow for the answer if it does
not appear sooner.

Sitting around the fire late one evening with our neighbors, drinking
tea and smoking \[redacted\], a young woman about 20 spoke up with a
question.

“Henry, you Europeans are reputed to be very smart. If you are smart
you should know who discovered zeroo (rhymes with “me too”) twendia.”

“I have no idea what zeroo twendia is” I said.

“I don’t know what it is either but I know who discovered it”

So here is your quiz: who discovered zeroo twendia?
