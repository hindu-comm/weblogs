New Mexico

New Mexico is the only state in the US where a noticeable mestizo (part
European, part Amerindian) population has been around for a long time.
If you’re interested in whether that population converges over time with
the general white population of the US in academics or IQ, it’s the
place to look – unless perhaps there is something fairly unusual about
New Mexico. Ron Unz has suggested talented people have been leaving New
Mexico long enough, in large enough numbers, to effectively change the
population, something like West Virginia.

First point is that it is not that easy for for differential emigration
to make a lot of difference. For that to happen, the emigrating
fraction has to have a significantly different distribution of IQ than
the population as a whole. You have to consider that narrow-sense
heritability is significantly less than 1. Lastly, the fraction
emigrating has to be relatively large, or emigration has to continue for
a long time, or both.

There are states in the US where there has been a relatively large
amount of out-migration, and West Virginia is one of them. There are
others, most noticeably in the upper Great Plains, which have been
hemorrhaging population since 1920 or so. New Mexico is not one of
them, at least if you believe the Census results on net out-migration.
North Dakota certainly has been such a state (until the recent oil and
gas boom) – yet its NAEP scores are consistently among the highest in
the country.  
States where lots of young people leave have high median ages. West
Virginia does, with a median age of 41.3 .  New Mexico with a median
age of 36.7, is just under the national average of 36.8 .

Do any of these stats support Ron’s notion? Nope.

Am I going to do a detailed, hammer-and-tongs criticism of Ron’s general
argument? No, because (in my opinion) it doesn’t amount to much. An
admixture study would give a definitive answer, one that avoids
complications like intermarriage, and that’ll happen soon enough.

\[addendum: the proposed mechanism for indumbnifying Hispanics in New
Mexico can only work if IQ is highly heritable… \]
