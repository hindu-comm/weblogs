Men and Macaques

I have reason to believe that few people understand genetic load very
well, probably for self-referential reasons, but better explanations
are possible.

One key point is that the amount of neutral variation is determined by
the long-term mutational rate and population history, while the amount
of deleterious variation \[genetic load\] is set by the selective
pressures and the prevailing mutation rate over a much shorter time
scale. For example, if you consider the class of mutations that reduce
fitness by 1%, what matters is the past few thousand years, not the past
few tens or hundreds of of thousands of years.

There is a recent article in BMC genetics that illustrates this. They
found that rhesus macaques are three times as diverse as humans, surely
because of a larger effective population size. But when you look at
nonsynonyous mutations, macaques have only 1.2 times as many as
humans. Now probably some of those nonsynonymous mutations are actually
harmless, but most must actually be deleterious – else why are they
relatively scarcer than neutral variation? Furthermore, in macaques, a
smaller fraction of those nonsynonymous mutations seem likely to be
damaging than in humans, so the actual number of deleterious mutations
in macaques may not be much different than the human average.

So, assuming that African populations have more neutral variation than
non-African populations (which is well-established), what do we expect
to see when we compare the levels of probably-damaging mutations in
those two populations? If the Africans and non-Africans had experienced
essentially similar mutation rates and selective pressures over the past
few thousand years, we would expect to see the *same* levels of
probably-damaging mutations. Bottlenecks that happened at the last
glacial maximum or in the expansion out of Africa are irrelevant – too
long ago to matter.

But we don’t. The amount of rare synonymous stuff is about 22% higher
in Africans. The amount of rare nonsynonymous stuff (usually at least
slightly deleterious) is 20.6% higher. The number of rare variants
predicted to be more deleterious is \~21.6% higher. The amount of stuff
predicted to be even more deleterious is \~27% higher. The number of
harmful looking loss-of-function mutations (yet *more* deleterious) is
25% higher.

It looks as if the excess grows as the severity of the mutations
increases. There is a scenario in which this is possible: the mutation
rate in Africa has increased *recently*. Not yesterday, but, say, over
the past few thousand years.

It takes a long time to change the frequency of deleterious mutations of
small effect. A change in selective pressures, or in the mutation rate,
can change the frequency of deleterious mutations of large effect much
more rapidly.  So it is perfectly possible for a population to
simultaneously have a lower-than-average level of small-effect mutations
and a higher-than-average level of moderate to severe mutations, or vice
versa.

What is the most likely cause of such variations in the mutation rate?
Right now, I’d say differences in average paternal age. We know that
modest differences (\~5 years) in average paternal age can easily
generate \~20% differences in the mutation rate. Such
between-population differences in mutation rates seem quite plausible,
particularly since the Neolithic.

What about the various comments in the coverage of Decode’s work about
how harmless a higher mutation rate must be, usually referring to the
past couple of centuries or so? They’re wrong, although not as
spectacularly as Stefánsson . He reminds me of that old Saturday Night
Live skit about how ‘inflation is your friend!”. Wouldn’t you like to
own a $4,000 suit, and smoke a $75 cigar, drive a $600,000 car? I know
*I* would ! In the same way,*mutation* is your friend. Doesn’t
everyone want to be one of the X-men? Sheesh, we should restart
atmospheric nuclear testing immediately, the bigger the better.
