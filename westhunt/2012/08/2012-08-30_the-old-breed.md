The Old Breed

John Hawks has found that Oetzi has more Neanderthal ancestry than
people in Europe today, while Dienekes has found that Oetzi’s extra dose
of archaic seems to come from the non-Near-Eastern fraction of his
ancestry. So it looks as if the old population of western Europe has a
fairly high Neanderthal fraction, maybe 8 or 9%.

At the other end of Eurasia, Australian Aborigines and Melanesians (and
the original inhabitants of the Philippines as well) have comparable
amounts of archaic ancestry – some Neanderthal, and about 5% Denisovan.

If you look at the map of Southeast Asia and Australia back in the ice
age, people would have entered Sundaland from the north. If there were
Denisovans living there, modern human invaders would have gradually
picked up more Denisovan ancestry as they moved farther in, and the
population with the largest amount of Denisovan ancestry would have been
that in eastern Sundaland, just as the most-Neanderthal population would
likely have lived in western Europe. That unusually-Denisovan
population would have been the one that crossed the water and colonized
the Philippines and Australia/New Guinea (called Sahul when joined),
expanding manyfold in those empty lands. If Hy Brasil or Avalon had
bothered to exist, they might have had a surprisingly Neanderthal native
population, for the same reason.

Later, various peoples expanded from less peripheral parts of Eurasia,
such as the Middle East or south China. They overran the old-fashioned
part-archaic hunter-gatherers, and the modern populations in those areas
have less archaic ancestry. So today the people living in the
Philippines do not have much Denisovan ancestry, nor do most people
living in Australia – where the replacement was quite recent. New
Guinea is the biggest exception, partly because they developed
agriculture independently, partly because the island’s rough terrain.
Even so, western New Guinea is now about half Indonesian, and there are
plenty more to come.
