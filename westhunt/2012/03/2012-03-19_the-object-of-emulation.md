The Object of Emulation

By definition, most people are not in the top 1% of intellect, so books
aimed primarily at that top 1% are never going to be best sellers. The
question arises, what is the most effective strategy for developing a
best seller? Thinking of Dan Brown and Malcolm Gladwell, it looks as if
simply being a person of modest intellect may be an effective strategy
for writers. I’m not saying that it is the only possible strategy, but
it may be easier if one never thinks of anything too complicated in the
first place, rather than having to weigh the level of difficulty of
every sentence and concept. Probably one would have to be a *lot*
smarter than average to effortlessly simulate normality, particularly in
real time. It is said that John von Neumann could do this. In much the
same way, emulating an obsolete computer is fairly easy – for machines
that are a decade more advanced.

This suggests that it is more important to be average than to appear
average: when Gladwell talks about ‘igon values’, he’s being sincere. He
may talk like an idiot, and look like an idiot, but don’t let that fool
you: he really is an idiot.

Of course, there are real advantages to high intelligence. It seems to
increase longevity, and it reduces the chance of financial disaster.
Maybe the best approach would be a temporary reduction in intelligence
– quite practical, since artificial stupidity is a solved problem. I
think that many writers already make use of this strategy.

The only downside is the hangover.
