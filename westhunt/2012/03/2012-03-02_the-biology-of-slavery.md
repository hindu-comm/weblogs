The Biology of Slavery

Why did slavery pay? In what circumstances? In a Malthusian world, a
laborer’s pay is just enough to allow him to raise two kids to
adulthood. That’s all the average peasant makes, so that’s all an
employer has to pay. Someone who raised slaves for labor would have to
spend just as much or go out of business, in the long run.

So, in the Classical world, slaves mainly made economic sense (for the
masters, natch) only if you could steal them, generally through wars of
conquest. If Rome enslaved a 20-year Thracian farmer, they could get
decades of work out of him without having to pay for his upbringing. All
of this assumes that the Romans had special expertise in conquest and
social control, and for the most part they did. Of course, if they
picked the wrong Thracian, they could be sorry.

As the Roman Empire cut back on conquest, slaves cost more. Since the
Empire had a fairly long period of internal peace and good government,
living standards naturally dropped. Population growth far outpaced
technical innovation, which was never a Roman strong point. Slavery
seems to have become less and less important. Certainly there was no
long-term, self-sustaining population of slaves.

Slavery in the American colonial era is a very different story.
Although many slaves were imported from Africa, the slave population
reproduced quite successfully. As C. Vann Woodward wrote: “So far as
history reveals, no other slave society, whether of antiquity or modern
times, has so much as sustained, much less greatly multiplied, its slave
population by relying on natural increase.” In a mostly-Malthusian
world, that is exactly what you would expect.

Before the War of the Rebellion, the natural growth of the slave
population was about 25% per decade, greater than any country in
Europe. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the slave health and
nutrition was equivalent to that of white Americans, or that their lives
were easy: but they had a higher standard of living than the typical
peasant in a country with a stable population. The main underlying
reason was that the US, in those days, was one of the least Malthusian
place that has ever existed. The Amerindian population had collapsed
(not before transmitting highly productive crops such as maize) and land
was abundant. Food was abundant and labor was not.

You can see why slavery might pay, but why African slavery? There is
reason to think that they were more productive farm workers than
Europeans in the American South , largely because they were
significantly more resistant to a number of tropical diseases. Almost
all people from central and west Africa are Duffy negative and are
highly resistant to vivax malaria. A number of different mutations
common in those same populations, such as sickle-cell, Hemoglobin C,
G6PD deficiency,etc. etc. give substantial protection against
falciparum malaria. Although the genetic details are at this point not
understood, people from sub-Saharan Africa are also resistant to
hookworm and are more likely to survive yellow fever.  One would
suspect that they also have greater heat tolerance.
