Zones of Thought

[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/205.png?w=640 "scientific papers")](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/205.png)

Most people think that science and math and engineering are found
everywhere, like soccer, but actually, they are regional practices, more
like hurling or tossing the caber. In the map, countries are resized
according to the number of scientific papers they produce. Population
size plays a role, but average productivity matters more. Note that
Singapore, with a population of 5 million, looks bigger than Indonesia,
with 240 million people.

You might think that scientific productivity depends on science funding,
rather than regional differences in talent. But you would be wrong. It
depends to some extent on money, but it depends more on the distribution
of talent. You can get a feel for the influence of money by comparing
China or India and their diasporas in the West. You see far higher
scientific productivity in those diaspora populations than in their
homelands. Partly this is due to selective immigration, but much of it
has to do with with economic (and cultural) differences).

Like the Chinese and Indians, some ethnic groups show mediocre results
in their benighted homelands and better results in Western countries. On
the other hand, other groups do poorly everywhere. People whose
ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa produce very few scientific
papers – on average – no matter where they live. This is also the case
(to a lesser extent) for mestizos from central and South America, for
Filipinos and Malays, and most of the Indian castes. You don’t see much
out of the Middle East, either – although Armenians are an exception,
and there may be others. Interestingly, Armenians were generally
thought (by themselves and others) to be smarter than the average bear
back in Byzantine times.

Generally the pattern is about what you would expect from the world
distribution of IQ (note the correlation with latitude), coupled with
the notion that science is generated by people out in the tail of the
intelligence distribution. About 2% of a population with an average IQ
of 100 scores above IQ above 130, about 0.1% above 145. For a
population with an average of 85, only 0.1% will score above 130 – 20
times fewer. I am, for the moment, disregarding fat tails and some
actual population differences in the standard deviation. The same thing
is happening with the Ashkenazi Jews: a modest shift in mean (about 0.8
standard deviation above the European average) causes a big change in
the fraction that exceeds a high threshold.

The officially approved theory in the US, and in most other Western
countries, is that all these differences are environmentally caused and
can be environmentally remedied. Of course no one has actually managed
to do this, anywhere. In Malaysia, there is a similar-sized IQ gap
(about 15 points) between the Chinese and the Malay majority, but their
attitude is different: no one seems to think that anything can be done
about it. They may be wrong….

Efforts to change this pattern can be fun to watch. I know of a
mathematician who admitted to a feeling of guilt when his department
repeatedly fulfilled its Hispanic affirmative action goals by hiring
Ashkenazi Jews from Argentina.

You might suspect that the pattern would change if we raised the bar,
looked at more extreme and important examples of scientific creativity,
rather than counting every paper. It does. If you look at Nobel prizes
in the sciences, or Fields medals, the differences become starker.
Whole nations disappear. Single individuals outdo whole civilizations.
The only noticeable deviation from the simple IQ-distribution pattern is
somewhat lower-than-expected scientific productivity, at the highest
levels, in northeast Asians. We will see if this persists as China
modernizes.

Some of these patterns are clearer when you look at mathematics, since
it doesn’t require expensive facilities, and has a strong tradition of
amateurism. At the limit, you can find people who never had any formal
training in mathematics but somehow produced work of the highest
quality, like Srinivasa Ramanujan or George Green. As far as I can
tell, these amazing amateurs almost always originate from the same
populations that produce large numbers of more conventional scientists.

Lastly, if we look at the demographics, it seems that every population
that produces serious scientific players has sub-replacement fertility.
