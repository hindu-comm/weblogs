Boiling Off

In principle you can imagine a group experiencing selection for some
trait by having members leave. However, it takes special
circumstances, unusual circumstances. First, the people who defect have
to be uncharacteristic: they have to differ from the group in the
trait, having higher (or lower) than average values of that trait. The
trait has to be heritable, but that’s not so much of an obstacle. Most
traits are.

The next point is hard to arrange: in order to select strongly, as large
as fraction as possible have to leave (and they should be be as
different as possible), but at the same time, the per-generation
fraction defecting has to be smaller than the rate of population growth,
else the group simply goes extinct before anything interesting has time
to happen. Since the long-run rate of population growth has been close
to zero for most of human history, this mechanism usually doesn’t work.

There are exceptions. The Amish are the clearest case. They have very
high rates of population growth, and have had for a long time, possible
only in a really non-Malthusian society like the US. They also have had
a high defection rate, but that has decreased quite a bit over the last
century. In one Ohio Amish community, it seems to have dropped from 30%
down to about 5%. Over times, high rates of defections may have
selected for lower values of the ‘bright lights, big city’ trait. It’s
possible that the Amish are genetically ‘plainer’ than they originally
were. In fact, this almost has to be the case. It’s not clear how much
of the decline in defection is explained by selection: the Amish may
also have developed social techniques that make defection less likely,
or it might be that the outside world is less attractive than it used
to be. Or all three things may have happened.

I call selection involving differential defection “boiling off” – the
lighter molecules escape more easily than the heavy ones, and the soup
gets thicker.
