Myriad Ways

Rushton thought that the explanation of geographical variation in IQ was
adaptation to a world with winters. I didn’t think that was crazy, but
I was pretty sure I could come up with ten other comparably plausible
explanations.  In some, the key events might have happened tens of
thousands of years ago, while others might have been recent enough to be
documented in the historical record.

Increasingly, I suspect that there is no single explanation. Maybe
several of my notions are partly true. The Ashkenazi Jews look like a
case of recent selection for white-collarism in a reproductively closed
merchant caste – and maybe there are similar explanations for the
Parsees and some of the high Indian castes.  Cousin marriage explains
some of what we see in places like Iraq or Uttar Pradesh. Increased
genetic load resulting from high average paternal age among polygamists
probably plays a role in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia. Adaptive
introgression from Neanderthals? Could be. Increased population size
among agriculturalists, resulting in Fisherian acceleration? Possible:
certainly civilized peoples generally beat out hunter-gatherers. Iodine
shortages? Surely.  Brain damage from capsaicin? You know it.

Pygmies apparently score very poorly on cognitive tests. I wonder if
that’s a side effect of being small: small brains must have lower
performance, all else equal. Something about rain forest environments
must select for pygmyism, since that phenotype has apparently evolved
independently a number of times. That may be yet another path leading
to low IQ.
