Mampires

In our book, I called lactose-tolerant people “mampires”, mutants that
live off the milk of another species. I think this is a really neat
word. But I cannot take credit for it: it was invented by my son
Roderick Cochran when he was 11.

He has also invented the word “florsh”, which is what happens when you
laugh so hard while drinking that stuff comes out of your nose.
Canonically, root beer.
