Being the Dutch

When responding to the Census, more than five million Americans claim to
be of Dutch descent. And they mostly are, at least a little. Now you
might wonder how they compare with the Dutch back in the Netherlands:
you might wonder about the relative academic or economic success of
these two groups, which presumably have a common ancestry. But you
would be wrong to do so. You would be comparing apples and House of
Orangemen.

There were four or five different Dutch waves of settlement in this
country. The first is pretty well-known, the Dutch colony in New York.
Of course, it was only about half Dutch in origin: the rest were
Walloons and French Huguenots. Lots of people have some ancestry from
that group, including people I know. Why, if there was any justice,
Henry Harpending would own a fine farm on Manhattan Island right now.

Of course, Henry isn’t all that Dutch. His surname is. He comes from
an area of New York State that really did have some Dutch settlement.
The thing is, white Protestants in this country have been intermarrying
rather freely for several hundred years: it is rare to find someone in
that category whose ancestors all come from one ethnicity. I would be
surprised if Henry is 1/8th Dutch. In much the same way, my patrilineal
lineage is Ulster Scot (who fears mention the battle of the Boyne!?) but
the rest includes English, Welsh, Scottish, Green Irish, and a
component that, I suspect, only became Dutch in 1918, and was Bavarian
before that. We’re talking about ye olde Americans, not Ellis Island
types. Not that they haven’t mixed as well, but less so…

There were later Dutch waves. Some moved to the Midwest in the 19th
century , mainly for land but sometimes also for religious reasons. You
find clumps in of them in Michigan and Iowa and Wisconsin. They haven’t
been here as long, and probably aren’t so totally mixed – but I still
think you’d have trouble finding many of them who were as much as 50%
Dutch by ancestry. I have another good friend whose father came from
that Iowa clump – although he himself grew up in Long Beach.

There was a post-WWII pulse out of Indonesia, about 60,000. Most of them
were half-Indonesian – like Eddie Van Halen’s mother.

Most of the people who self-identify as Dutch-Americans are mostly
something else. Why? Sometimes a family tradition, or a surname,
but more than anything else, fashion.

Fashions change. For example, the fraction of Americans who report
English ancestry has dropped *drastically* since 1980 – so much that so
that you would have to wonder about secret death camps if you took it
seriously. But it’s fashion. I looked at the census numbers for my
home county, and then looked at the phone book: Census result was 20%
English ancestry, real number was more like 80%. Of course this means
that people in the US claiming a particular ethnicity can not only have
limited ancestry from that group, but be oddly unrepresentative as well.

Sometimes those fashions have economic drivers. For several decades
now, there have been racial favoritism policies (mostly governmental,
partly private) : different admissions criteria for low-performing
groups, different criteria for scholarships, business set-asides,
casinos for Injuns, etc.

I know it’s shocking, but people game those things. They lie. Look at
Foxwoods: I doubt if anyone involved is as much as 25% Amerindian. But
if you make enough political contributions, you can probably be anything
you want to be – even Klingon or Ruritanian. I remember an
Italian-American schoolteacher who moved to San Diego and changed his
name to Garcia: it was useful. I am reminded of a kid who was the star
student at MIT’s ‘disadvantaged minority’ prep course one summer: he
was 1/128th Potawotamie Indian. A credit to his race!

There are lots of people in New Mexico with both Hispanic/Mestizo and
“Anglo” ancestry: there was a time in which it was probably useful to
minimize your Hispanicness, but for the last 30 or 40 years, it has
clearly been better to maximize it, which may make for an odd kind of
population growth.. So if a kid’s mother (or grandmother) is from one
of the old Hispanic families here, he can get a scholarship to the State
U with a significantly lower score than my kids can. White man’s
burden, I guess. Changing your name might help (Henry knows of a case
or two, from when he was teaching in Albuquerque) but that is not really
necessary. You can get Hispanic AA credit if your last name is Jensen.
Nobody ever checks.

Of course, with genetic engineering on the horizon, someday we’ll see
people actually switching their ethnicity (It’s Tuesday, I must be
Belgian!) – or perhaps subtly exaggerating it. I am reminded of a
certain Flannery I knew, who impressed me as being so Irish that he was
barely even human.

Membership is not this fluid for every group in the US – and even if it
is today, it may not have been until recently. Jews intermarry a lot
today, particularly non-Orthodox Jews, but the rate was much lower in
living memory – and far lower than that, back in Europe. Blacks really
do average about 80% African ancestry – SNPs don’t lie. Out in the West,
some Indian tribes really are pretty Indian.

If you want to make comparisons, you have to know your subject. You
need to know something about this country. I wonder how many people do.
