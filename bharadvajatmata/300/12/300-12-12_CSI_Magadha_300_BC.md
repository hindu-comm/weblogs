### Introduction

The only persistent theme in the history of all living beings is violence. From smashing a rival bandsman’s head with a bone in the earliest ages to blowing up entire cities with nuclear weapons in modern times — many things changed but violence persisted. However, humanity could not have ever ascended to the stage it is in currently without recognizing the importance of cohesion among people and the cost of violent coercion. While inter-people violence could benefit chiefdoms by increasing social cohesion and bringing loot and slaves; intra-people violence did the opposite and broke social cohesion. At some stage, it was thus recognized that behaviour breaking the social cohesion of any people needs to be dealt with. Indeed, not all tribes came to this understanding, as only six states have ever appeared out of the tens of thousands of tribes across the world. In low-complexity societies, Homeric Greece for example, we find violence to still be an interpersonal thing and resolution methods involve bargaining. The offending party would seek to appease the anger of the kin of the deceased by gifting them gold, slaves or through marital alliance among other things. However, appeasement isn’t a reliable form of justice and thus in more complex societies, like those of Mesopotamia, one of the six original states, offending behaviour is no longer an interpersonal bargain but a crime violating the laws of the state. Here, we find the first law code in existence, the Code of Ur-Nammu (2112–2094 BC), what deviated from norms good for society and brought harm to the people became a crime, and through laws to punish the doers of crime, the king claims to have established equity in his lands and began times when:

> The orphan was not delivered up to the rich man; the widow was not > delivered up to the mighty man; the man of one shekel was not > delivered up to the man of one mina.

Familiar H would instantly be reminded how seers held Manu, the first lawgiver, in high regard, for bringing about an end to matsyanyāya \[मत्स्यन्याय\], the law of the fish\], where the big mercilessly devours the small, a situation of chaos anarchy. However, the existence of laws or law enforcers wasn’t sufficient alone to do justice. But as societies became complex, so did criminals and crime, often concealing the identity of criminals, something even early civilizations weren’t good at dealing with. In earlier times, people from Rome to India to China adopted the emotional discretion of juries; ordeals of fire, water, poison, combat; divinations and trials by mobs to deal with such problems. However, as the modern mind can comprehend, these methods were primitive and thus often both incorrect and susceptible to corruption due to a lack of material evidence. From here, begins the need for procedural investigations into crime using both scientific and social cues, to ascertain the truth behind all happenings and do justice to the grieved. In modern times, we laymen know these methods as forensics, profiling etc and in this essay, we shall look at developments in these fields in Ancient India & some overlaps from across the world. We shall only focus on investigating and catching criminals rather than look at the proceedings of courts.

### Criminal Investigations from KAS:

#### Honeypots and Instigation

Despite the great advances of modern forensic sciences, investigations remain a difficult process, it is thus not too hard to imagine that lacking the knowledge of such scientific analysis must’ve made the collection of material evidence even harder. Thus, before discussing any investigation, the seer recommends instigation to arrest potential criminals red-handed. Like modern honeypots laid by three-letter agencies on social media — we find undercover agents, ascetics and women doing the same for the then Secret Service to capture large organized crime bands.

In one template he provides, secret agents (involving prostitutes and ascetics) operate in two groups — one will station itself in a village as couples and guards while the other pose as thieves. These thieves shall rouse a group of bandits & lead them to the village to rob them easily with magical means. Upon coming across guards near the village they shall use their invisibility spell which will allow their group to pass through the faces of guards (who are secret agents playing their part) undetected. Then they shall make use of a door-opening spell to open the doors of houses they intend to rob, where secret agents are stationed as husband and wife. Next, they shall use sleep-inducing spells to carry away guards and men and then use love-inducing spells to make the disguised wives present in houses please the criminals they’ve brought. In this manner, they shall win over the trust of the bandits. Agents can choose alternate approaches like disguising themselves as veteran thieves on the run etc.

Once they’ve won over the trust of the bandits, there are multiple ways of dealing with them. They can either allow them to rob marked articles which can be traced in markets while being pawned or sold, allowing agents to arrest more associated persons; or they can kill them during a raid or arrest them and torture them to get information on their associates, or they can convince the bandits to gather together for a great heist in an important place like a fort — where they can all be rounded up together and arrested on the spot.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F989fc65f-8f5d-4ced-a535-c2fe2b93a0b3_658x659.png)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F989fc65f-8f5d-4ced-a535-c2fe2b93a0b3_658x659.png)

Maintaining the faith of the people in the omnipresence of the king was important to Kautilya. Thus, he recommends that such criminals should be paraded in public with the declaration that the King had learnt rare mystical lore for catching thieves, and it is because of him that the thieves have been caught. Collectors, like magicians putting on a show, should make use of previously extracted information & reveal hidden stolen items with their descriptions in public one by one. Finally, by creating a mist of omnipresence, he should appeal to criminals to surrender as well.

#### Profiling through Suspicious Activities

Although modern profiling methods are the first to evaluate criminal behaviour statistically and create a science around it, people all across the world had been reading physiological cues and social behaviour long before that. The KAS preserves one such early scientific study of criminal behaviour which can be used to profile a murderer, thief or someone with a secret source of income. Keeping these cues in mind, authorities can narrow down the list of potential suspects in a crime. Alternatively, these men can be investigated separately for rousing suspicion. These twenty-six cues are:

1.  Someone whose inheritance and family fortune have been depleted

2.  Someone receiving a paltry wage.

3.  Someone who gives false information regarding his native land,
    caste, lineage, name, or occupation.

4.  Someone with a covert occupation or undertaking; someone addicted to
    meat, liquor, food, delicacies, perfume, garlands, clothes, or
    ornaments.

5.  Someone undertaking extravagant expenditures.

6.  Someone addicted to prostitutes, gambling, or taverns.

7.  Someone travelling abroad constantly.

8.  Someone with merchandise regarding which one does not know where it
    is located or where it is being transported to.

9.  Someone who visits lonely places, the wilderness, and parks at
    inappropriate times.

10. Someone who holds frequent meetings or discussions at a place that
    is concealed or has victims he could prey on.

11. Someone who gets recently inflicted wounds treated secretly.

12. Someone who always remains indoors.

13. Someone going here and there.

14. Someone who haunts wild tracts.

15. Someone who is constantly inquiring about other people’s
    possessions, and about other people’s wives, assets, or houses.

16. Someone in possession of implements associated with a reprehensible
    activity or science (referring to esoterica)

17. Someone moving clandestinely along the shadows of walls at night’s
    end.

18. Someone selling articles in an altered form at an improper place or
    time.

19. Someone whose heart is filled with animosity.

20. Someone with a low occupation or \<//\>.

21. Someone concealing his appearance.

22. Someone who, although not an ascetic, carries the emblems of an
    ascetic, or who, although an ascetic, follows a contrary behaviour
    pattern.

23. Someone who has previously committed a crime.

24. Someone betrayed by his own activities.

25. Someone who, at the sight of the City Manager or high official,
    absconds, flees, remains seated without voiding excrement, or
    becomes agitated, or whose voice or facial complexion becomes
    parched or transformed.

26. Someone frightened by a throng of men carrying weapons.

None of these cues needs any particular explanation. They only contain what would seem like common sense rather than inferences from an advanced psychological study. However, their merits lie in the fact by standardizing them, Kautilya has laid foundations of creating a science around them. We should also note that what appears common sense to our mind may not be so to people of the past.

#### Dealing with Stolen Goods

It was expected that all traders would inform the Superintendent of the Marketplace when dealing in goods of suspicious origins & should return lost goods unless they wish to pay a fine. If a reported article is concealed in possession by a trader after purchasing it from a thief, then he's equally liable to prosecution. If officers come across a reported good on anyone, they should interrogate him about its origins, physical nature, value, place and time of the transaction, and his legal title concerning the article should be verified. If his ownership or rental of said articles can be corroborated then he should be released else considered a thief. This verse captures the essence of physical examination when dealing with goods:

> For even among quadrupeds and bipeds, there is similarity in > appearance and distinguishing marks—how much more among forest > produce, ornaments, and wares produced with material from the same > source and by the same manufacturer?

#### Forensic Examination

The first section relates to acquiring material evidence in case of burglary, probably in a large estate. Officers are supposed to examine breaches other than doors like latticed windows, upper-floor eaves, holes in walls etc. They should then scout for debris from chiselling, crushing and other activities carried out for creating the breach. If such debris or tools are found inside the house, or if the location of hinges or joints couldn’t have been known to an outsider — the list of suspects should be narrowed towards insiders. If debris or tools are found outside the breaches, then an outsider is to be investigated. If there is an overlap then he should investigate an insider acting as an accomplice.

Outsider thieves fall under the purview of the County Supervisor and his Magistrates who may employ the previously mentioned methods. Officers under the City Manager are once again expected to make use of profiling if material evidence points to an insider. They should look for the following clues:

1.  A man close by who has fallen on hard times.

2.  One who associates with cruel people or has burglar’s tools in his
    possession.

3.  A woman from a poor family or enamoured by another man.

4.  A domestic servant of similar conduct (as mentioned in (3))

5.  Someone who is sleeping a lot, overcome by sleep, agitated, whose
    voice or facial complexion is parched or transformed, who is nervous
    or prattling excessively.

6.  Someone whose legs have become stiff by climbing high.

7.  Someone whose body and clothes are cut, frayed, rent, or torn.

8.  Someone whose hands and feet are scarred or stiffened.

9.  Someone whose hair and nails are full of dust, or whose hair and
    nails are cut and twisted.

10. Someone who has bathed and anointed himself thoroughly massaged his
    legs with oil, or just washed his hands and feet.

11. Someone whose exact footprints are found on dusty or wet surfaces.

12. Someone whose garland, liquor, perfume, pieces of clothing,
    unguents, or sweat match those found at the point of entry or exit.

Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are easily understandable as a person who’s been influenced by outsiders or lost wealth will have the motive to commit a burglary. Point 5 notes the behaviour of a novice afraid of possibly being caught. Points 6, 7, 8 and 9 will be observed in a man who was climbing or jumping through inaccessible points, using tools to open vaults or create breaches, crouching through the shadows or digging holes — all of which point towards criminal activity. Notably, all of these are of great value to modern forensics as well. Point 10 deals with a man who cleans himself after committing a crime to get rid of all evidence.

Point 12 is of great value: the smells of perfumes, liquor, and sweat on insiders should be compared with those found at breaches and compared. Modern law enforcement uses specially trained dogs and forensic odour analysis to make such comparisons, but during Kautilya’s time, it was based on the discretion of the investigating authority. Officers are also expected to search for pieces of clothing, garlands, unguents or other articles at breaches which can be traced back to a person. From our study of the Shuihuidi manuscripts, we learn that pieces of clothing were sought after as evidence during the Qin Era in China as well.

Regarding aromatic analysis as discussed in the above paragraph, we recently came across the Mahā-Ummagga jataka of the Nastikas, which discusses an interesting case. We learn that long long ago, in the Kingdom of Mithila where King Videha ruled, there existed a sagacious Mahosadha who resided in the Yavamajjhaka village and went around solving cases at his leisure:

> A certain poor woman had tied together several threads of different > colours and made them into a necklace, which she took off from her > neck and placed on her clothes as she went down to bathe in a tank > which the pandit had caused to be made. A young woman who saw this > conceived a longing for it, took it up and said to her, "Lady, this is > a very beautiful necklace, how much did it cost to make? I will make > such a one for myself. May I put it on my own neck and ascertain its > size?" >
> The other gave her leave, and she put it on her neck and ran off. The > elder woman seeing it came quickly out of the water, and putting on > her clothes ran after her and seized hold of her dress, crying, "You > are running away with a; necklace which I made." >
> The other replied, "I am not taking anything of yours, it is the > necklace which I wear on my neck"; and a great crowd collected as they > heard this. The sage, while he played with the boys, heard them > quarrelling as they passed by the door of the hall and asked what the > noise was about. When he heard the cause of the quarrel he sent for > them both, and having known at once by her countenance which was the > thief, he asked them whether they would abide by his decision. >
> On their both agreeing to do so, he asked the thief, "What scent do > you use for this necklace?" She replied, "I always use > *sabbasaṁhhāraka*\[an omnigatherum\] to scent it with." Then he asked > the other, who replied, "How shall a poor woman like me get > *sabbasaṁhāraka?* I always scent it with perfume made of *piyaṅgu* > flowers." >
> Then the sage had a vessel of water brought and put the necklace in > it. Then he sent for a perfume-seller and told him to smell the vessel > and find out what it smelt of. He directly recognised the smell of the > *piyaṅgu* flower, and said >
> "No omnigatherum it is; only the kaṅgu smells;  
> You wicked woman told a lie; the truth the gammer tells."

As the story describes to us, the sage consulted with a perfume seller, who puts the article in water and then identifies its smell, thus enabling the sage to carry out judgement. We initially noted that the investigating authority’s discretion would determine the result of a smell test. However, it appears that officers would consult with perfumers or the ilk while investigating smells of articles in a case. Since this was the case in much cruder times like those described above, a higher complexity state like Kautilya's can be naturally expected to follow it.

Point 11 is again of great value: we are told that officers are expected to look for exact footprints of criminals found on wet, oily or dusty surfaces. The idea that footprints are inimitable was thus known to Kautilya. He also utilized them for tracking animals and identifying elephants. During the Qin-Han periods in China, we learn that the Chinese had learnt that even fingerprints are inimitable and officials made use of them as legal devices, representing their authority.

A paper by Mr Kumagusu Minakata shared by [@Rjrasva](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva) on the antiquity of the fingerprint methods reveals to us that fingerprinting was quite common in the Sinosphere and India. Although Kautilya isn’t aware of it, Duan Qing Xi informs us that hand stamps were commonly used in India as well in the ninth century, some 1200 years after Kautilya’s time. Two researchers from the Ministry of Home Affairs also claim that it was common knowledge in India that ‘Tanjira’, that is handprints, were inimitable and were used for identification. However, they have not attached any source for their claim [here](http://www.bioline.org.br/request?jp00100) and thus it can’t be verified.

From second-century Rome, we learn of a famous case titled ‘Paries Palmatus’, where a stepmother frames her blind son for the murder of his father to become the sole inheritor of his wealth. The quick-witted attorney Quintilian defends the blind son by examining the bloody handprints on a wall at the crime scene which did not match that of the blind son. In another case from Rome, we learnt that Emperor Nero’s mother, Agrippina, upon learning that her enemy Lollia Paulina had committed suicide, asked for her head to verify her death. Even though the head was damaged beyond recognition, Agrippina recognized a distinct front tooth she’d seen in Lollia Paulina’s mouth previously, thus verifying her death. Although we are uncertain whether Romans were aware of the inimitability of tooth prints, Xuanzang relates a tale which confirms that Indians were surely aware of that in the Gupta Age.

> "I have received my royal inheritance in succession, and I desire to > hand it down to those who follow me ; my only fear is lest I should > lose aught of it and so dishonour rny ancestors. I now confide to you > the government of Takshashila. The affairs of a country are of serious > importance ; the feelings of men are contradictory ; undertake nothing > rashly, so as to endanger your authority ; **verify the orders sent > you ; my seal is the impression of my teeth ; here in my mouth is my > seal**. There can be no mistake." >
> ……… >
> " My father, if he has ordered my death, must be obeyed **; and the > seal of his teeth is a sure sign of the truth of the order**. There > can be no error."

These extracts from an episode concerning the wicked Emperor Ashoka from Xuanzang’s travelogue show that dental imprints by biting on tablets could serve as unimitable seals. We did not find dental imprints in Chinese or Indian literature before this period, so most likely it was a method that came into existence during the Gupta Age \[4-5th century\] & proliferated into Harsha’s time when Xuanzang visited, from where he picked it up and retrofitted it into an Ashokan legend.

#### A Full Investion: Homicide

When a dead body is found, it must first be coated with oil to preserve it. Then officers should look for the following symptoms in order to ascertain the cause of death:

1.  Death by suffocation through strangulation:

    1.  Urine and faeces have spurted out.

    2.  Abdominal skin is bloated with wind.

    3.  Hands and feet are swollen.

    4.  Eyes are open wide.

    5.  The throat has marks on it

2.  Death by hanging: Arms and thighs are drawn together + All marks of
    strangulation are present

3.  Killed by placing on a stake:

    1.  Hands, feet, and stomach are swollen.

    2.  Eyes are drawn in.

    3.  The navel is bulging out.

4.  Drowned:

    1.  Anus and eyes are closed.

    2.  Teeth have bitten into the tongue.

    3.  The stomach is distended.

5.  Killed with blunt force using sticks and stones: Blood is smeared
    around and the limbs are broken or disjointed.

6.  Thrown from a high elevation: Limbs are broken up and blown apart

7.  Poisoned to death:

    1.  The hands, feet, teeth, and nails have turned dark.

    2.  the flesh, bodily hair, and skin have turned droop.

    3.  The mouth is coated with foam.

8.  Killed by poisonous beings: Presence of bloody fangs + all marks of
    poisoning.

9.  Killed by Coma-Inducing Mixture:

    1.  Contortion of clothes and limbs.

    2.  Excessive vomiting and purging.

The Coma-Inducing Mixture is a terrible drug used to kill people which was manufactured in the following manner:

> A mixture of ginger, Gautama-vṛkṣa, Kaṇṭakāra, and Mayūrapadī ; a > mixture of Guñjā , Lāṅgalī , Viṣamūlikā , and Iṅgudī ; a mixture of > Karavīra, Akṣi, Pīluka, Arka, and Mr̥gamāraṇī , when combined with a > decoction of Madana and Kodrava, or with a decoction of Hastikarṇa and > Palāśa, forms a coma-inducing mixture

The symptoms aren’t mutually exclusive, and often criminals may attempt to cover up their crimes by leading the investigation astray by changing the mode of death. In the case of hanging, Kautilya advises a secondary examination of the body to ensure that it is not the case when a murderer hangs a dead body to pass it off as a suicide.

Poisoners in the past had an advantage over their victims because it was impossible to detect poisons in the bloodstream and identify them correctly to prepare an antidote. However, poisons outside the bloodstream could be tested and even identified in some cases. An unspecified material extracted from the heart of the was to be thrown in the fire. If it shows a certain colour or makes a cackling noise, the presence of poison is confirmed. If the heart remains unburnt properly even after the body has been cremated, it should also be taken as a sign of poisoning. Additionally, there should be an examination of leftovers by feeding them to birds — if the birds die, the food was poisoned.

Once more, from the Mahā-Ummagga jataka, we learn of an alternate mode of conducting food analysis, carried out by Mahosadha:

> A certain man who dwelt in the village of Yavamajjhaka bought some > cattle from another village and brought them home. The next day he > took them to a field of grass to graze and rode on the back of one of > the cattle. Being tired he got down and sat on the ground and fell > asleep, and meanwhile a thief came and carried off the cattle. When he > woke he saw not his cattle, but as he gazed on every side he beheld > the thief running away. Jumping up he shouted, "Where are you taking > my cattle?" >
> The thief replied, "They are my cattle, and I am carrying them to the > place which I wish." A great crowd collected as they heard the > dispute. When the sage heard the noise as they passed by the door of > the hall, he sent for them both. When he saw their behaviour he at > once knew which was the thief and which the real owner. But though he > felt sure, he asked them what they were quarrelling about. >
> The owner said, "I bought these cattle from a certain person in such a > village, and I brought them home and put them in a field of grass. > This thief saw that I was not watching and came and carried them off. > Looking in all directions I caught sight of him and pursued and caught > him. The people of such a village know that I bought the cattle and > took them." >
> The thief replied, "This man speaks falsely, they were born in my > house." The sage said, "I will decide your case fairly; will you abide > by my decision?" and they promised so to abide. Then thinking to > himself that he must win the hearts of the people he first asked the > thief, "What have you fed these cattle with, and what have you given > them to drink?" >
> The thief replied, "They have drunk rice gruel and have been fed on > sesame flour and kidney beans." Then he asked the real owner, who > said, "My lord, how could a poor man like me get rice gruel and the > rest? I fed them on grass." >
> The pandit caused an assembly to be brought together and ordered panic > seeds to be brought and ground in a mortar and moistened with water > and given to the cattle, and they forthwith vomited only grass. He > shewed this to the assembly, and then asked the thief, "Art thou the > thief or not?" He confessed that he was the thief. He said to him, > "Then do not commit such a sin henceforth."

By feeding spoilt sees to cattle, which caused it to vomit out its food — the sage here was able to prove its ownership to the people. This is an interesting case shedding light on forensic sciences on the living once again.

Immediate leftovers need not necessarily be the source of poison always either. Officers should test other articles for poison as well. These can be identified in the following manner:

1.  Poisoned boiled rice: steam gives the colour of a peacock’s neck,
    frigidity, quick discolouration as if stale, presence of water, and
    not being moist.

2.  Poisoned curries: becomes dry quickly, bubble continuously, have a
    dirty appearance, frothing, curdling, and the destruction of smell,
    texture, and taste.

3.  Poisoned liquids: the appearance of a hue fainter or more
    pronounced, and the appearance of upward streaks at the edges of the
    froth.

4.  Poisoned juice, milk, liquor, curd, honey: a blue, reddish, black,
    dark, white streak in the middle respectively.

5.  Poisoned wet substances: becoming quickly withered, becoming
    overcooked, and a bluish-dark colour while boiling

6.  Poisoned dry substances: crumbling quickly and discolouration.

7.  Poisoned hard & soft substances: softness in the former and hardness
    in the latter, as also the death of small creatures in their
    vicinity

8.  Poisoned bedsheets and covers: the appearance of dark circles and
    the crumbling of the thread, wool, and hair

9.  Poisoned metals and gems: appear soiled with muddy dirt, and the
    destruction of the smoothness, pigment, weight, potency, colour, and
    texture.

If a poisoning is witnessed instantly, officers are expected to profile the poisoner using the following signs:

> Dry and dark look on the face, stuttering speech, excessive > perspiration and yawning, trembling, stumbling, looking around while > speaking, agitation while working, and not remaining in his place — > these are the marks of a poisoner

After ascertaining the cause, place and time of death, officers should launch a probe into people with possible motivations to commit the crime. In case of poisoning or covering up a murder by hanging, these include domestic servants who were subjected to severe verbal or physical abuse; wives who have been aggrieved or are enamoured of another man; relatives who covet his inheritance, livelihood, or wife etc.

In all other cases, professional rivals, partners in business, men who share hostility, men who’ve been wronged, men whose families or inheritance have been wronged, and men involved in litigation with the victim should be thoroughly investigated.

Officers were expected to survey the neighbourhood of the crime scene and ask questions about people who might’ve killed him or had him murdered out of hatred or for property, or whether it is possible that he was mistakenly killed by another. A schedule of the victim’s activities on the days before his death should be prepared and people who met him or stayed with him should be brought for interrogation. Interrogations should begin with questions like “Who brought this man here? or Who killed him? Did you see anyone who was carrying a weapon, trying to hide himself, or agitated?” and then continued based on responses.

All the articles like personal effects, clothes, costumes, or ornaments should be noted and through the Superintendent of Marketplaces, their dealers should be summoned for questioning as well. Their relationships with the victim, receipts of transactions, reasons for travelling, other occupations, and permanent address should be ascertained as well.

#### Interrogation: Theft

Kautilya invokes the tale of the seer Avi-Mandavya, who out of fear of torture accepted that he was a thief despite being innocent and was killed as punishment. Therefore, he advises that torture and punishment should only come upon convincing evidence. Suspects cannot be arrested without reasonable evidence against them, and torture can be carried out only in rare cases. If officers violate these rules, they can be fined or killed depending on the nature of their offence. Likewise, anyone who falsely accuses another of a crime shall be punished as an offender of that crime himself.

A person accused of theft should be brought before the offended party and witnesses from all sides should be presented. The suspect should be interrogated about his country, caste, lineage, name, occupation, wealth, associates, and residence first. His alibis on the day preceding the day of his arrest should be noted. Without material evidence or witnesses, questioning cannot be carried out after three a lapse of three days. All actions, transactions and goods of the suspect should be corroborated against the entry and receipt of goods obtained from marketplaces.

Artisans operated without written receipts and were thus more prone to suspicion, in case the suspect lacked written receipts and cannot be subject to torture. He should be left with secret agents and spies on his tail. They should be stationed at taverns, water booths, and markets and try to win his confidence or get him drunk and have witnesses placed behind false walls or in the surroundings to learn his ways. His honesty can be tested by giving him a marked valuable article for safekeeping by a seemingly innocent man who is about to flee the country. Officers should then question him about the origins of the article later and judge his honesty. Thus, by outwitting criminals, they can be forced to give a confession.

In rare cases where there is convincing evidence of the crime, the suspect is subject to torture for confession, before being sent to the judges for a sentence. Eighteen types of tortures are described and only one can be carried out on a day:

> There are four kinds of conventional torture: six strokes with a > stick, seven lashes with a whip, two suspensions, and the water tube. > Beyond that, for those who have committed grave crimes there are nine > strokes with a cane, 12 lashes with a whip, two thigh bindings, 20 > strokes with a Naktamāla-twig, 32 slaps, two scorpion bindings, two > hangings, needle in the hand, burning one digit of a finger of a man > after he has drunk gruel, heating in the sun for one day for a man > after he has drunk oil, and sleeping during a winter night on a bed > with points of Balbaja-grass. These are the 18 types of torture.

### Conclusion

I was initially interested in doing a comparative study of investigation methods under the impression that formalized methods had existed elsewhere but I failed to find any. We do find some excellent examples from the Greco-Roman world like that of Quintilian using bloodstains, Archimedes finding out impurity in the crown, or Tiberius using drag marks on the floor to trial Silvanus.

> ... Plautius Silvanus, the prætor, for unknown reasons, threw his wife > Apronia out of a window. When summoned before the emperor by Lucius > Apronius, his father-in-law, he replied incoherently, representing > that he was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing, and that > his wife had chosen to destroy herself. Without a moment's delay > Tiberius went to the house and inspected the chamber, where were seen > the marks of her struggling and of her forcible ejection. He reported > this to the Senate, and as soon as judges had been appointed, > Urgulania, the grandmother of Silvanus, sent her grandson a dagger. > This was thought equivalent to a hint from the emperor, because of the > known intimacy between Augusta and Urgulania. The accused tried the > steel in vain, and then allowed his veins to be opened. Shortly > afterwards Numantina, his former wife, was charged with having caused > her husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions, but she > was acquitted.

However, these are odd examples rather than systematic science dealing with criminal investigations. We often lament that, unlike the Greco-Romans who have plenty of records of battles, H only have some odd examples which don’t necessarily make a lot of sense. However, concerning criminal investigation, the roles are reversed. The numerous Shuihudi bamboo manuscripts found in central China in 1975 — something of a discovery of the Arthashastra in 1905 moment for the Han, does throw a lot of light on legal proceedings in Qin Era. These proceedings are highly systematic and deal with both the trials at courts and the investigation, but once again we are unable to ascertain if there were theoretical sciences and laws behind this or whether they were based upon a heuristical understanding of criminal investigation and discretion. The elaborate nature of the reports does point to the existence of some laws governing these, however, so far I’ve not found any \[will be happy to be corrected :-)

Although the great seer advises proper reports, none seem to survive in India, even though his laws have survived, whereas in China it seems to be the opposite for this period. I believe this gap can be filled by the Shuihudi manuscripts and would thus like to present one excellent example for the readers —

> Report: A, who is director so-and-so of such-and- such ward, has > stated: >
> "C, a commoner of the ward, has died by hanging in his house. The > cause is unknown and I have come to report." >
> Prefect clerk so-and-so was thereupon ordered to go to the deceased's > house and examine. Report by prefect clerk so-and-so: >
> "Together with prison bondsman so-and-so, I accompanied A, as well as > C's wife and daughter, to examine C. C's corpse, facing south, was > hanging from the rafter at the northern wall within the bedroom on the > east side of the house. The neck was encircled by a hemp rope as thick > as one's thumb, which was knotted at the nape of the neck. Above, the > rope came together at the rafter, around which it was twice looped and > then tied. Its remaining portion beyond the knot was two feet long. > The head was two feet away from the rafter above. Its feet failed by > two inches to touch the floor. The head and back touched the wall. The > tongue protruded as far as the lips. **Both legs were soiled by > discharges of excrement and urine.** >
> Upon releasing the rope, the breath issued with a gasp from mouth and > nose.

This is what a report would perhaps look like if one from India is discovered. One should note the many details and inferences mentioned here — from the distance between shoes and the body to recanting that a lot of time has elapsed since the death which is why the mouth & nose are unable to gasp. I’ve highlighted the observations which are explicitly found in KAS as well. From our study of some of the cases, while forensics seem to be on an equal standing the Han had a much lesser investigatory prowess and lacked interest in outwitting criminals by setting them up. But, take a look at this passage from Song Ci’s Xi Yuan Lu.

> Then examine whether the deceased's clothes are new or old. Measure > the position of the corpse ac- cording to the compass points, noting > which way the face and back point and what the deceased stood upon. >
> Measure the distance between the head and whatever the body was > suspended from, as well as that between the feet and ground. . . >
> When releasing the rope from the body, measure its entire length and > its length around \[the throat\].... >
> **In cases of suicide by strangulation, the two eyes will be closed, > the lips and mouth black, . . . the teeth exposed.** >
> If the noose was above the Adam's apple, the mouth will be closed, the > teeth firmly set, and the tongue pressed against the teeth but not > protruding. If below, the mouth will be open, with the tip of the > tongue protruding two or three tenths of an inch. >
> The face will be purple red, and at the corners of the mouth and on > the chest there will be frothy saliva. The hands will be clenched . . > . and the toes of the feet pointing downward....

Song Ci \[1186–1249 AD\] was a great polymath of his times, from whose treatise “Washing away of Wrongs” the above extract is taken. Quickwitted men must’ve noticed that there exists an impressive similarity between the procedure carried out by the Qin Era bureaucrat and that recommended by Song Ci. Song Ci’s expanse of forensic sciences was also far greater than what was known to either H or Han during the Qin Era. Surely with the advances in surgery and medicine by doyens like Caraka, who were considered superior in China ever, there must’ve opened up new directions for pursuing forensic sciences. But what happened instead?

Song Ci’s Nomenclature of Bones

Rather than develop upon findings of the past as seen in the case of the striking similarity between Song Ci and the Qin Era bureaucrats examination, H chose to instead completely abandon whatever knowledge they had and the Arthashastra started to become a distant memory.

In the end, what brought ruin to H weren’t barbarians raining arrows from their mobile horses pouring from the north-west on mobile horses, but the fact that they failed to print out sufficient copies containing detailed diagrams of the nomenclature of bones which their eastern counterparts did well and later their western counterparts excelled at…
