The Northern Song \[960-1126 AD\] is characterized by a uniquely dynamic environment facilitating the growth of sciences, industry and philosophy. With the advent of the Printing Press, which made education more widely available, coupled with the reasonably meritocratic and dynamic structures of the Empire which could readily absorb new talent continuously, we learn of several unprecedented advancements in this period. The various strains of Antiquarianism are perhaps something that will always manage to astonish people, such as ourselves. Much has been written on their technological and scientific achievements by Joseph Needham, but more interestingly — way before Archaeology even began as an informal institution and science in Europe between the 17th-18th centuries, there was a great interest in archaeological, numismatic and philological studies during the Northern Song. The Song literati and gentry’s interest in archaeology was driven by several reasons, the most important one being a strain of Confucian revanchism — which desired that ritual items be reconstructed accurately or re-discovered entirely and ancient state rituals be revived. The Neo-Confucian school prospering under the Song had a special interest in the heydays of the Zhou Dynasty \[1050 - 221 BC\]. This revanchism materialised when a Shang Bronze vessel was obtained near Anyang, the last Shang capital after the Yellow River shifted course. The desire to legitimize ethnic Han authority after decades of unstable non-Han rule and threats from the Khitan, Liao and Jurchen powers also aided these studies. What began here was covered by layers of several additional motives, one such being the correction of erroneous histories as mentioned by the famous Song Epigraphist Zhao Mingcheng \[赵明诚\] in his treatise Jin Shi Lu \[金石錄\]:

> After reading the classics in my youth, I found the deeds of princes > and ministers recorded in detail in the histories, and although right > and wrong are praised and criticized, this is based on the subjective > opinions of the writers and may fall short of reality. In the > important matters of good and bad, however, there is that which must > not be misconstructed. Moreover, these opinions have been handed down > for a long time and one should expect them to be reliable. But take > such things as chronology, geography, official titles, and genealogy, > for example. When archaeological materials are used to examine these > things, **30-40% data are in conflict.** That is because historical > writings are produced by latter-day writers and cannot fail to contain errors. But the inscriptions on stone and bronze are made at the time the events take place and can be trusted without reservation, and thus discrepancies may be discovered.

Such a critical attitude towards historical sources and the desire to correct them by obtaining archaeological evidence in the eleventh century is indeed extraordinary. He does not shy away from mentioning that 30-40% of the archaeological data, largely inscriptions on stone and bronze he studied as an epigraphist, was inconsistent with textual material. Such textual criticism and reproduction through archaeological sources weren’t limited to Zhao Mingcheng but instead were quite a popular theme among the Song literati. The Hong brothers Hong Kuo and Hong Mai mentioned how 80% of stelae from the Han Dynasty had already been destroyed due to the erosion of mountains and rivers apart from other natural causes, which called for an active salvaging of history before it is lost forever. Although Hong Mai was no archaeologist himself, he was indeed conversant with the recovered objects and pointed out the contradictions in his Rongzhai Suibi \[容齋隨筆\]:

> During the ZhengHe & XuanHe periods \[1119–1125 AD\] the government > established a number of offices for the compilation of books. The most > imperfect and ridiculous of the books to issue from these offices is the Po-ku-tu. Recently I obtained a Yi vessel of the Han dynasty, so I took the corresponding volume of this book and read it, and I am bursting my sides with laughter.

This unusual strain of textual criticism through an archaeological dimension which mirrors modern archaeological studies began with the erudite Ouyang Xiu \[歐陽脩 1007-1072 AD\] who renewed writing in prose, just like in the days of Confucius and Mencius. His inclination towards Confucianism was a result of being unable to suffer the decay that Nastika-s brought to the Han race, and only by returning to the ancient ways could they be countered:

> This Nastika curse has overspread the empire for a thousand years, and what can one man in one day do about it? The people are drunk with it, and it has entered the marrow of their bones; it is surely not to be overcome by eloquent talk. What, then, is to be done?

Ouyang Xiu was joined by all the neo-Confucians, especially the much revered Zhu Xi in his disdain for Nastika-s and the consequent Confucian revanchism. He wrote his own critical editions of histories by compiling various sources, way before the Imperial Court started funding such activities. While Ouyang was not an archaeologist, he had been studying inscriptions on bronze ritual objects from the Zhou to Han dynasties. These were copied on paper with the ink rubbing technique and the script was then converted into contemporary Chinese, which was followed by a commentary on the object alongside a line drawing. Ouyang Xiu notes that most of the inscriptions were unearthed by farmers and herders around Changan and were reported to his student, Liu Chang, who was an inspector in Shanxi. In his pursuit of an absolutely correct understanding of the past, he had collected over a thousand such ink rubbings \[tapian 拓片\]. Most of these are unfortunately lost to time, but his ten-volume work named Jigu lu \[䳶古錄\] published in 1069 does survive, which talks about the methods of collecting inscriptions, the need for textual correction and appropriate ritual performance. The following is the preface to the Jigulu:

> In general terms, however, having the wherewithal to acquire an object > is not as good as being possessed by the love for that object, and > being possessed by the love for an object requires resolute > single-mindedness. As I am by nature addicted to antiquity and have no > desire whatsoever for those things that men of this present age hanker > after so ardently, my attentions have been focused on my love for > objects such as these. So intense is this love, that although my means > have inadequate, I have nonetheless managed to assemble a collection. > They date from the time of King Mu of the Zhou Dynasty onwards, down > through the Qin, the Han, the Sui, Tang and Five Dynasties, their geographical reach encompasses the Four Seas and the Nine Provinces. They derive from famous mountains and broad marshes, isolated cliffs and cut-off valleys, wild forests and ruined tombs.

An example of an Ink-rubbing inscription on the top-left with its transcription below in contemporary Chinese script, and a line drawing of the associated excavated ritual vessel from one of the few surviving works of Ouyang Xiu \[1007-1072 AD\] (pls edit out later if source not found, check national palace museum)

Ouyang boasts a huge collection from all over Chinese space and time, and more importantly, unlike the many innovations which happened under imperial patronage — Ouyang was driven solely by personal interest. We learn that these had been acquired from old marshes, mountains, valleys and tombs. Ouyang was not the only man of his time with a private collection of historic bronzes and stones, others included his disciple Liu Chang and the famous painter Li Gonglin. This in my opinion began formal studies into archaeology as a mass discipline under imperial patronage. Antiquaranism was called Jinshixue \[金石學\] or “Stone and Metal studies” relating to inscriptions on stelae, stones or ritual bronzes. The other name was Kaoguxue \[考古學\] which is related to the same and is used interchangeably with Jinshixue. In later times, Jinshixue became Epigraphy and Kaoguxue became Archaeology. During the Northern Song, we learn that over 40 collections of historical objects existed and there were over 120 publications regarding their study and their significance. There were plenty more private collections as well, a Song record speaking of as many as 65. With the inflow of Jin hordes and the fall of the Northern Song in the 1120s, a great majority of them were lost, although Southern Song maintained these traditions very well.

Indeed, at times, archaeological excavations being unscientifically examined led to erroneous conclusions, as seen in the case of the Song scholar Huang Bosi \[11th C\], but the spirit of inquiry and self-correction is nonetheless exemplary. Huang Bosi had excavated some Bamboo slips in a pot found near Shenshi which was dated to the Han Dynasty. He reports that the majority of the bamboo slips were illigible but based on an incorrect reading of “Yi Wei” as “Ding Wei” in one of the fully preserved slips he erroneously declares the following:

> The bamboo slips are very dear on these points because they are > contemporary documents \[from the Han Dynasty, dating to the Year > 108\]. Moreover, all of the dates are in agreement, unlike the > erroneous dates in the histories \[the Hou Han Shu: History of the > Han\], and the material in the slips should be regarded as correct. **Alas! After a thousand years these slips have fortunately been preserved to make it possible to correct the mistakes in Fan Yeh's History**.

Before analyzing any documents or objects of any sort, one has to collect them too. This again was an activity in which the Song literati were heavily invested. The collection of objects was always accompanied by records maintaining the routes travelled; the villages encountered; the distances walked; the topography of the area encountered; accounts of temples, and ancient ruins; objects excavated from the target area alongside the date and time. Arthur Walley, commenting on some of the Chinese records from the sixteenth century writes that they outdid the famous explorer Aurel Stein in capturing even the most minute details. Thankfully, I was able to find the original text of one such travelogue by the famous Song poet Fan Chengda \[范成大 1126–1193\] titled the “Records of the Wu Ships” or Wu Chuanlu \[吳船錄\]. Although he wasn’t an archaeologist and instead worked on leisure, here is one small excerpt from his work:

> 甲辰。發下壩。百里，至敘州宣化縣。百二十里，至敘州，纔亭午。敘，古戎州也 >
> In the year of Jiachen, we set off from Xiaba. After traveling a hundred li, we arrived at Xuanhua County in Suzhou. After another hundred and twenty li, we reached Suzhou, just around noon. Suzhou was formerly known as Rongzhou in ancient times. >

> 舊戎州在對江平坡之上，與夷蠻雜處。馬湖江自夷中出，合大江。夷自馬湖舟行，必過舊州下，故聯鎖於江口，以防其出沒。今徙州治於南岸，而鎖江之名猶存，猶置鎖中流，但攔稅而已。 >
> The old Rongzhou was situated on a slope facing the river, mingling > with the tribes. The Mahu River emerges from the tribal region and > merges with the main river.

> **In the old county, there is a "Monument to Commemorate the > Meritorious Deeds of Wei Gao" that stands tall amidst the wild > undergrowth.** The various tribes along the river hold great reverence for their dwellings, and the forests are lush.

He leaves a detailed record of his journey alongside local histories and discovers a monument dedicated to Wei Gao under the wilderness shadowing it. He also finds an inscription there and compares the characters with what was present in printed texts. Not all of those who set out to discover were private scholars like Fan Chengda however, sometimes there were dedicated officials commissioned on specific missions as well. In 1086, the official Chang Li had set out on a seven-day expedition to find out the remains of the original Tang Dynasty capital someplace south of Changan. Often military officials, with their exceptional powers, were employed too. One such person was You Shixiong, who took great interest in the Zhaoling Mausoleum of Emperor Taizong of Tang and carved out a stele at the site in 1094.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde310d7c-b80a-4be0-aaba-3d585db084f2_483x831.png)

The top records a few names of officials involved in the work and mentions that the motivation for erecting this stele was that the number of stele was disappearing because of a number of causes, these are not mentioned but we can assume both natural and man-made troubles. To preserve the Zhaoling Tomb for future generations, he has decided to erect another stele with a detailed map of the tomb (faintly visible in the above diagram). This map indeed proved itself to be very useful for future generations and has been critical to the study o the Zhaoling Mausoleum even in modern times. Coming back to man-made causes of the disappearance of stelae, we should note that wherever there is interest and consequently a market, all sorts of grifters and malcontents show up, the heydays of the Song were no different. Notably, more items existed in private collections of affluent men rather than public collections present in Imperial museums or temples. Although antiquarianism reached exceptional heights under the Song, it had existed in the preceding Eras as well. The Tang Dynasty law codex Tang Lu Shu-I \[唐律疏議\] has an article against robbing graves and tombs. It also mentions that all finds of antiquities are the property of the state. We don’t have information on whether such laws existed during the Song or not but we do find officials collecting fines in ancient bronzes or seizing them immediately upon discovery. In this manner, the magistrate of Guangzhou had built a collection of around sixty ancient bronzes for himself. Hobbyists, akin to those in the modern day often wrote essays on how they procured certain objects from markets while travelling to obscure ancient regions. After the fall of the Northern Song to Jin hordes, we hear of great inflation in the prices of ink rubbings of ancient inscriptions being brought in down the Yangtze and merchants made great profits selling them. The Gold Rush for archaeological remains during the Song is best explained by this famous expression appearing several times in many books:

> There was no place where people did not go in their search for ancient bronzes; marshes were drained and hills were dug into, and no important tomb in the empire remained unopened

Islam Akhun, an Uyghur professional con man who sold a number of fake manuscripts to the great explorer Aurel Stein

Surely, in such an environment, there must have been a number of gentlemen of refined tastes who sought to make a profit out of the desperation of archaeologists and scholars, like the Uyghur pictured above. Thus, the question concerning the genuineness of any discovery becomes pertinent. The Guangchuan Shu Ba \[廣川書跋\] or “Postscript to the Guangchuan Book” written by a Northern Song scholar of obscure origins who went by the name Dong Yu shares insights into an examination of antiquities brought to him by Huang Bosi:

> 祕閣有敦其實鼎也政和三年內降宣和殿古器圖凡百卷考論形制甚備於是館下以藏古器別為書譜上挍書郎黃伯思以圖示余曰商素敦者其髙五寸五分深四寸一分口徑六寸七分其受八升重六斤有七兩皆今之權量挍也其制㒳蜼首耳下有珥蓋其尾岐出且曰古敦之存於今者若周宰辟父敦散季敦𨚕牧敦戠敦虢姜敦皆有欵識此器特異疑為商人製也余考之雖寓屬其尾岐出古之宗彞也自虞舜已然豈特商邪於是定以為蜼鼎 >

We see a remarkable exchange between the two where they examine the many different physical features to ascertain whether the Dun Ding really belonged to the Shang Dynasty or not. Dong Yu concluded that it may not necessarily belong to the Shang even though claiming it would’ve awarded him even greater merit. In another exchange between Huang Bosi and Dong Yu, we see a careful examination of ideograms and the evolution of language in order to ascertain which period the given vessel truly belonged to:

> 王存乂以亞為烏今考鍾鼎銘惡或為亞古人於書盖假借從聲其書自當如此周禮曰其川滹池古文駝作馳字池故沱也詩曰江有沱其字本洍後世不知書學故以沱為洍以駝為沱此宜讀惡池為亞駝不足怪也烏池在周為漚夷水起北地東入河一名滱水九澤一也顧野王考其地在靈邱竹書紀年穆公十一年取靈邱則秦誓於此所以夸大其功而求定於晉也黃伯思學士以烏駝為在烏氏按烏氏在安定郡烏水所出觀秦方得晉地恐不盡質于安定一郡故知在靈邱為是書詛楚文後 >

Dong Yu refutes Huang Bosi's claim that it originates from the Wu Clan of Anding, asserting instead, based on philological and historical analysis, that it hails from Lingqiu. Beyond the intricacies of this discourse, which I myself may not fully comprehend and some aspects of which may be lost in translation, what remains significant is the robust intellectual tradition that demanded meticulous scrutiny of objects before acknowledging their authenticity. In another instance, Dong Yu exposes the truth behind a vessel purportedly belonging to the Xilian Xia people, revealing it to be the creation of a southwestern tribe. He admonishes the literati for their lack of critical examination when assessing the genuineness of antiquities. What Dong Yu possesses as a skill, can be seen as an educative institution in the Dongtian Qinglu.

The Dongtian Qinglu \[洞天清录\], written by Zhao Xihu, a descendant of Prince Yanzhao from the House of Dezhao, is a remarkable work that delves deeper into antiquities. Created during the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Southern Song Dynasty \[1225-1264\], this book employs meticulous methods to discern the authenticity and significance of ancient artefacts. Its meticulous examination and classification criteria rival modern archaeological practices, making it highly esteemed even during the Ming and Qing periods. Moreover, it boldly dispels misconceptions that had prevailed for centuries. To share a few examples: it posits that the "DiaoDou" is not just a simple cooking utensil but a military tool; while the Bronze Rhinoceroses and Toads, mistaken for water droppers today, actually served a different purpose in ancient times. The following table mentions the number of criteria used for classifying and evaluating objects:

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d4b4aed-b340-4379-802d-e15d815ad751_827x418.png)

Indeed, a small fraction of the criteria for evaluation are inconsistent and naive, but overall, the treatise is exceptional in meticulousness. I shall share an example of an evaluation of Ancient Qin \[musical instruments\] below:

> 古琴以斷紋為證。琴不曆五百歲不斷。愈久則斷愈多。然斷有數等。 >
> The proof of an ancient qin lies in its grain pattern. A qin that has not passed five hundred years will not have any breaks. The longer the age, the more breaks there will be. However, breaks can be categorized into different types. >
> 有蛇腹斷。有紋橫截琴面，相去或一寸或二寸，節節相似如蛇腹下紋。 >
> There are snake belly breaks, where the grain pattern is cut horizontally on the surface of the qin, with a distance of one or two inches between each segment, resembling the pattern on the underside of a snake's belly. >
> 有細紋斷。如髪千百條，亦停勻，多在琴之兩旁，而近岳處則無之。有面與底皆斷者。 >
> There are fine grain breaks, resembling thousands of strands of hair, evenly spaced. They are mostly found on both sides of the qin, while the area near the sound holes is usually devoid of them. Some qins have breaks on both the front and back. >
> 又有梅花斷。其紋如梅花頭，此為極古，非千餘載不能有也。 >
> There are also plum blossom breaks, where the pattern resembles the head of a plum blossom. This is extremely rare and can only be found in very ancient qins that are over a thousand years old. >
> 蓋漆器無斷紋而琴獨有之者，蓋他器用布漆，琴則不用。他器安閒，而琴日夜為弦所激，又歲久桐腐而漆相離破。斷紋隱處雖腐，磨礪至再重加光漆，其紋愈見，然真斷紋如劍鋒，偽則否。 >
> Unlike lacquerware, which does not have grain breaks, qins uniquely > have them. This is because other objects are coated with fabric > lacquer, while qins are not.

Although the breaks may be hidden under decay, with repeated polishing and lacquering, the breaks become more visible. However, true breaks resemble the sharp edge of a sword, while false breaks do not. >

The way in which Zhao Xihu analyzes grain patterns, break edges, decay, layers of polishing etc for analyzing the age of musical instruments of the Qin type is very admirable and sets apart the intellectual culture of the Song from the rest of the world. Yet Zhao Xihu wasn’t the only one doing it and just one among the many geniuses of that age. Thus, one can establish that Song Antiquarianism wasn’t based on filmy notions and forgeries but on a strong culture of criticism, inquiry and evaluation, which ensured that only the best items were sought after.

No discussion about Song Antiquarianism could be complete without Lu Dalin’s \[呂大臨 1042-1090 AD\] Kaogutu \[考古圖\] and Wang Fu’s \[王黼 1079-1126 AD\] Xuanhe Bogutu \[宣和博古圖\] which was modelled on the former. The Tu \[圖\] in Kaogutu and Bogutu means “Illustrations” and they were exactly that. While at a point as many as 120 of these existed, only these two have survived wholly today with us. The Kaogutu is dated to 1092 AD and a manuscript from 1299 survives with us as well, confirming its authenticity. While Lu Dalin was not the first to document antiquities, his style would set him apart from the likes of Ouyang Xiu and Liu Chang. Lu Dalin was one of the many Confucian scholars and officials opposed to Wang Anshi’s reforms, and this alongside his Boshi rank at the National University put him in the limelight to interact with a great number of literati and inspect their collections. As a Confucian, he criticizes Daoists, Zhuangzi in particular for attacking the Confucianists for their love of the long-gone past. Lu Dalin is distressed by the ignorance of the people of his time and by studying the past through archaeology — wishes to be with the Ancients. I will share his entire introduction below as I personally find it quite beautiful and also an educative lesson for traditional H:

> The followers of Zhuangzi fault Confucians for missing the truth in > pursuing the vestiges of the past and learning how not to change with > the times, offering the account of Wheelwright Bian and the metaphor > of the straw dogs as evidence \[for what the Confucians do wrong\], > \[lhe Zhuangzians\] even go so far as to cite the stories of the > fisherman and Dao Zhi, as well as the notion that Confucians use the > Poems and Rituals to justify unearthing tombs, to utterly slander \[Confucian learning\]. To learn without understanding how to change is truly a fault. But is it not the case that changing without knowing to stop at the mean is even more offensive? >
> They treat learning as falsehood, knowledge as useless drudgery, > benevolence as indulgence, and ritual as vacuous ornamentation, yet > fail to realize why the Sages deserve veneration and the former kings > warrant emulation. "To restrain the self with propriety" : they call > it losing one s human nature. "To agree with antiquity and reject the > present": they call it disrupting governance. Yet what of burying scholars alive, burning the classics, and thereby achieving satisfaction by making all people under Heaven ignorant? From this perspective, which of these two ways of learning causes greater harm? >
> Yao, Shun, Yu, and Gao Yao all said, "Investigate antiquity." > Confucius himself said, "Adore antiquity, and seek it out diligently." > Although that which is called antiquity is simply the assembled traces > of the former kings, those who investigate it and those who adore it > must seek out the reason for its being a trace. That which \[their\] > rules, measures, methods, and images con- sign to the present holds > within the essential principles of the Sages. These continuities > between past and present, which have remained unchanged for a hundred > generations - can we simply call them straw dogs and Wheelwright Bian? > When the Han dynasty inherited the remains from the Qin book burning, looking back to the Three Dynasties \[of Xia, Shang, and Zhou was already\] like passing through the transformations of day and night, dream and awakening. >
> **Although only a few fragments of ancient texts remain, the world has > changed, and people have died.

In essence, the Kaogutu serves as a documentation of antiquities and a means to rectify textual interpretations & understanding of rituals. Its ultimate goal is to forge a connection between the bygone era and the contemporary world, enabling people to embody the spirit of the ancients and pass on accurate knowledge to future generations. With this noble objective in mind, Lu Dalin has meticulously crafted a comprehensive catalogue featuring some 230 antiquities. The details of these artefacts are encapsulated in the following table:

In the Kagotu, accompanying the sketch, we find either a rubbing of the inscription elegantly inscribed in seal script depending on antiquity, along with its transcription in the regular script. The comprehensive description provided encompasses the object's name; the collector's identity; the treasured location where the object is preserved; the place of origin, precise dimensions; weight, and often an analysis of the artefact itself. Notably, while the illustrations depict the ornate decorations, they are missing from the textual descriptions which focus only on noteworthy attributes. Two examples are shared below:

It can thus be argued that the three vessels can be dated to that period of time. — [Source](http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Science/kaogutu.html)

The ink-rubbing of the inscription on the vessel is given on the middle page, which in this case only has one character. The page on the right has a line drawing and the page on the left has commentary regarding the features of the vessel and its provenance in space and time. Lu Dalin gives exact measurements of the vessel and using explanations from the Zhou Dynasty work Shiji, argues that it belonged to either the Shang or Xia. As studies in antiquities grew further, it attracted the attention of Emperor Huizong \[1082-1135 AD\], a man of fine taste and intellect. In 1103, he passed a ritual reform edict, which decreed that the court rituals must be corrected to conform to the Confucian classics more accurately, especially the Zhouli. The imperial court during his reign sent functionaries all over the country to procure antiquities from farmers, herders, and merchants of adventurers who had been digging up marshes and tombs. In this economy, officials like Li Biangshi, who were adept at sales of ancient stelae, calligraphy, paintings and bronzes quickly rose to fame. Whenever the court procured an object of esteem, its ink rubbings were quickly transported all over the nation for study and publicity. Important objects were also sometimes taken from private collections for studies in weights, measurements and designs by respective bureaus. These were all used to prepare bronzes conforming to the days of Shang and Zhou and in line with the Confucian Classics. One such example is shared below:

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cc4e30f-a4e0-4020-bc12-3ce09179c49f_880x347.png)

Handle for a cast Bell at Huizong’s court — these were created from the set of an excavated Zhou bell.

Emperor Huizong also commissioned several studies on epigraphy, genealogy and quality assessment of antiques, and himself wrote a treatise on numismatics titled the Quan Zhi. In 1113, he announced that his collection had reached a total of 500 objects. Before entering this collection, an object had to pass a number of tests and prove its value if it did not belong to a pre-Qin era. By the end, this collection seems to have grown up to 6000 pieces. These objects were on display in imperial museums and temples — the greatest one of them being the Xuanhe Hall \[宣和殿\]. The Xuanhe Bogutu \[宣和博古圖\] introduced previously is a catalogue of the 839 objects present in the Xuanhe Hall imperial museum. The objects date from the Shang \[17th to 11th C BC\] to Tang \[7th to 9th C AD\] chronologically in each volume and by type they are categorized as follows:

The types here are tripods, mugs, pots, paintings etc and so on

Apart from the huge detailed collection of the XuanHe Bogutu, what is even more impressive is the number of exact archaeological matches we have to prove its authenticity. Take this Zhou Dynasty bronze vessel cover for instance, which was recently excavated:

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa721e579-87be-4ed7-b2ae-ff923f54f7a8_682x498.png)

The Xuanhe Bogutu has the exact piece available with documentation about its origins, ink rubbing of the seal script inscription and line drawing of the object:

What is even remarkable is that upon paying close attention, we note that the inscription is EXACTLY the same as that on the excavated Zhou dynasty vessel, leaving no doubt about the veracity of Emperor Huizong’s great collection and the capacity of the Song scholars.

This is also the case with another Zhou dynasty bronze tripod recorded in the Xuanhe Bogutu. It does have one small mistake — the diameter of the vessel is off by a margin of 10%. Nonetheless, that such records would even exist is simply unimaginable to the H mind.

**Shen Kuo, the Epitome of Song Intellectualism:**

Before ending the essay, I find it imperative to discuss in brief the great polymath Shen Kuo and his relation with archaeology especially, which is both modern and radical. I seem to have forgotten about fitting him in, and thus will just leave a short note below. It would be preferable for you to read his [Wikipedia here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo) (which I will be partly quoting in the final paragraph).

Shen Kuo did not care much for restoring ancient rituals by using excavated objects, instead, he thought of using them to advance armaments. This was pursued by Huang Bosi shortly before him as well, who deduced that all commentators had been wrong about the “Ke” and it was in reality a spear-like weapon. However, he did criticize several reconstructions of ancient ritual vessels made by the Song literati for being more imaginative than data-driven. Wonder what would he have to say about our race, which indulges only in imagination instead of using archaeological and textual data when recreating than past?[Much like Lucius Seneca](https://twitter.com/Sapratha/status/1580546596961648642?s=20)from Greece, who lived much before, Shen Kuo criticizes those who attribute antiquities to the Ancient Sages and Kings, instead, he demands that they honour the people who created them.

Unlike Confucian literati and nobility who were content with using the antiquities to project state power and restore ancient rituals, Shen Kuo was not content so superficially. He chased interdisciplinary studies that applied archaeology to metallurgy, optics, textiles, geometry, weaponry, astronomy, music and even paleomorphology.

He thought of the bronzes to reflect the regular metallurgy of their ages and thus studied the material and mode of production by carrying out huge empirical examinations combined with textual material. As a result, Shen Kua could rebuild highly accurate ancient armillary spheres when heading the Directorate of Astronomy. Upon studying ancient weaponry from both texts and objects, he could reconstruct scaled sights of ancient crossbows and recreate old swords made of composite blades with midribs of wrought-iron & low-carbon steel and dual sharp edges of high-carbon steel. By studying ancient utensils with raised reliefs — he also created raised topological maps in a twenty-three-set atlas at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. The reliefs were created using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste, akin to the Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan. Shen Kuo as a musician also made use of ancient musical objects to create the method of hanging a bell with a hollow handle for playing music.

![File:TaihangMountain8.jpg](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27550935-99ce-41cd-aa88-99785393b93a_559x600.jpeg "File:TaihangMountain8.jpg")

Geological Strata visible at the Taihing Mountains

While on an expedition near the Taihing mountains, Shen Kuo observed the geological strata of the rocks which contained sea shells despite being hundreds of miles away from the sea — Shen Kuo inferred using other observed evidence that land was formed due to inundation of silt and that the entire region was an ocean a long time ago, and he was indeed correct, something which would be proven only in 1802. Another time while on an expedition to Yenan, Shen Kuo observed the presence of a large number of petrified bamboo roots and trunks in an underground space near a collapsed bank. Yenan did not have a climate suitable for growing bamboos ever so he began investigating whether any of the previous dynasties had such a climate. Finally, he concluded that in the past Yenan must have been a damp and gloomy place. It was only because of archaeological studies that he could take this exceptional departure into paleo-geomorphological and paleo-climatological studies.

With Shen Kuo, the Han had peaked, and soon all of it would be lost forever with a series of invasions from the Steppes, a grim reminder of how fragile civilization is. While antiquarianism did pick up later on and even influence Korea and Japan for a long time, it lacked the vigour of the Song, and their meticulousness would be reintroduced only by modern times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

While I was aware for a long time that there was a strain of antiquarianism in the Song dynasty, I had overlooked it thinking that it was yet another case of overflowing the significance of a few finds and logical leap of faith rather than any scientific study. My interest in the topic was re-ignited recently upon seeing this tweet by Prathamesh Godbole:

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6af5b6e-015b-439a-8135-494aa21a2281_702x842.png)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6af5b6e-015b-439a-8135-494aa21a2281_702x842.png)

It was quite amusing to see that Hs were so myopic and detached from history that they were not even aware that guns had arrived not so long ago unlike Ghazni who raided long long ago. I immediately tried to see if the Han showed awareness of forms and people more ancient to them and drew accordingly, I came across the painting titled “Xiao Yi swipes the lanting scroll” which accurately preserved features of a Tang dynasty painting of leaving the background dark and lots of empty spaces between objects rather than give in to the sophistication of Song styles.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F951a41f2-200b-4e18-b035-e02671de6119_1327x507.png)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F951a41f2-200b-4e18-b035-e02671de6119_1327x507.png)

This is just an addition to their reconstructions of ancient vessels, weapons, astronomical tools, costumes etc. Indeed, ignorance like in Prathamesh’s tweet was a feature of a number of peoples, like the Ghaznavids themselves portraying the Pandavas and Mongols without having any understanding of ancient Aryan culture. However, if one only seeks to compare themselves with the class clown rather than the class topper — then they will always set themselves up for failure. In such a scenario, they would be hypocrites to object to Santhal imagery of Bhagwan Yama as a policeman as well — in line with what H had been doing until a few centuries ago.

Lu Dalin, the traditionalist whom we discussed here, could have easily relied on the various commentators before him, many of them being as much as a thousand years or so old. Or he could have accepted an antique as belonging to the age of Shang or Zhou instead of assigning them to a tribal people as he did. Why did he start tearing apart his own history then? Because he was driven by a need for self-correction, which was the only way for him and his people to live among the ancients and stake a claim at continuity. In our experience, however, discounting the malcontents who are undeservingly critical of H — these voices are a bunch of dullards who choose to live in fantasies \[conquering the Song!!\] even today, unwilling to dive deeper with a spirit of self-correction. If they continue to do so without seeing where they have failed — they will fare no better than the [Brahmana from the tales of Shu Huijiao](https://twitter.com/Sapratha/status/1637793090487431169), who despite being a master of the Vedas was made to put his head at the feet of the Han and convert since he was lacking in knowledge of their Classics.
