The Han nastika scholar Xuan Zang \[玄奘\] inspired by his predecessor Faxian \[法顯\] and concerned about misinterpretations in scripture, decided to embark on a journey to India with a mission to collect many nastika manuscripts. After the completion of his seventeen-year-long journey and his return to Chang’an, he was persuaded by the Tang Emperor Li Shimin \[598-649 AD\] to write a travelogue describing all that he witnessed in India. This travelogue, known to us as *“Great Tang Records on the Western Regions”* \[*Da-Tang xi yu ji* 大唐西域記**\]**, had become an instant hit in China, even inspiring the Ming Era novel “*Journey to the West”* \[西遊記\] which is considered to be one of the **“***Four Masterworks”* \[四大奇書\]. Although many of Xuan Zang’s stories have failed to impress modern Indologists and Sinologists alike, they nonetheless contain some valuable data which can be utilized to create a sketch of the religious demography of India in the mid-seventh century. For this purpose, we shall refer to Dr K.T.S. Sarao’s work where he created a comprehensive table of Xuan Zang’s observation of religious denominations in 71 countries. It can be noticed that nastika~s were failing in 52 out of the 71 countries and were strong only in thirteen of them.

While we cannot say with any certainty that his observations or our results here would be a reflection of the religious demographics in the mid-seventh century, it makes for an interesting exercise nonetheless. The most notable failure of this exercise would be its inability to separate the predominance of nastika~s monasteries in urban settings from a relation with real demographics. This is because nastika dwellings were largely in urban centres while Hs worked at a grassroots level.

### Methodology

Before proceeding further, we should recall that none of Xuanzang’s observations was in real-time. It is only after decades that he starts writing his travelogue. Thus, most figures contain phrases like “more than/around (a round number)”, “less than (a round number)”, “many (tens or hundreds)” etcetera. Usually, when talking of a city, he gives the count of few or all amongst the number of monasteries, number of temples, number of monks and number of heretics. The German historian Hans Delbrück, the doyen of critical writings in modern military history, clearly shows how impossibly difficult it is to count the number of men present anywhere. If such difficulties could be faced by even modern men, then we can only imagine how difficult it must have been for people who lived a thousand or so years ago. Stationary buildings of eminence are much easier to count and their presence can be corroborated by a lot of people as well. Thus, for this reason, we shall ignore the observations concerning monks and heretics and only utilize the remaining for any sketch.

I shall now provide the list of transformations we’ll carry out to make the data more interpretable. Please note that I do not have ANY rationale to explain these, apart from the fact that they seemed intuitively truthful to me. In cases where a round number is supplemented with “less than,” we shall take 80% of the value presented. In the case where a round number is supplemented with “many,” we shall multiply it by four. In the case where a round number less than 100 is supplemented with a “more than/around,” we shall use the following transformation. Here, 10 and 20 become 12 and 22, then numbers from 30 to 50 receive a 10% increment and finally, the increment is fixed at 5.

Similarly, in order to estimate phrases such as “more than/around N hundred,” we shall assign 100 and 200 to 120 and 220, and then the numbers between 300 to 500 will receive a 10% increment which will be fixed at 50 finally for all numbers greater than 500.

In cases where there are no comments by Xuanzang or comments include phrases like “all are ruined,” we shall use a placeholder value of 1 there. In the rare case where 1 is present in one column and “ruined” in another, we shall raise the former to 2. In the case where neither are mentioned but monasteries are said to have been all ruined with heretics running amok, we shall raise temples to 4 and monasteries to 1. If neither is mentioned and the status is under “holding ground,” we shall raise temples to 2. The location of the dots on the map plotted below shall correspond to their modern locations. The size of the dot will represent the total number of temples and monasteries counted. The colour of the dot will represent the ratio of occupancy by Hs. Since the observations and ratio vary primarily in size, we shall perform the following transformation to normalize them.

\\Total\\ =\\ Log\_{2}\left(Monasteries\\ +\\ Temples\right) \\

\\H\_{Ratio}\\ =\\ \arctan\left(\frac{Temples}{Monasteries}\right)\cdot\frac{2}{\pi}\\

This map includes 65 places which we were able to identify out of the 72 Xuanzang visited. All of them are inside the Indian subcontinent barring Baluka, which is modern-day Aksu city in Xinjiang, China. A yellow dot indicates a higher presence of temples while purple indicates a higher presence of monasteries.

Distribution of Hs & Nastika~s, from Xuanzang’s travelogue ~650AD

#### Notes:

> We’ll only briefly discuss this period relevant to Xuanzang’s work, a > detailed evaluation can be found in Dr Sarao’s work

Nastika~s grew rapidly in Madhydesha after their inception and this growth continued under the Kushana period. As Srinivasan points out, less than 10 out of 300 inscriptions excavated from Mathura between the Maurya-Kushana period belonged to Hs. Fa Xian observed in the fourth century that nastika~s were losing ground in Uttar Pradesh while Xuanzang notes most ancient monasteries were in ruins around Magadha. Even in places like Mathura where nastika~s continued to dominate, their numbers were declining. Nastika~s were completely absent and their monasteries desolate when Xuanzang visited modern Rajasthan and Haryana. Strong nastika presence outside India ensured that even abandoned monasteries would continuously receive gifts from Myanmar, Sri Lanka and other foreign nations. Huna destruction of monasteries seems to have contributed slightly to it as later Korean travellers found many monasteries burnt around Sarnath but monasteries in neighbouring regions were safe nonetheless. In conclusion, barring a few urban centres like Mathura, Jhansi and Varanasi, nastika~s were rapidly losing ground in Madhya Desha and were already completely absent in Rajasthan and Haryana.

In the east, nastika~s had been declining after foreign trade with Rome and urbanization fell in the fourth century, among many other reasons. During Xuanzang’s visit to Odisha, the southern countries were completely free from their presence while the north had an upper hand over Hs. It will find itself revived partially a century later under the Bhaumakara~s. In Bengal, Xuanzang noticed lesser monasteries than Fa Xian, suggesting a decline. In Tamralipti, for instance, they had decreased from 24 to a little more than 10. Temples outnumbered monasteries by a small margin in most regions of Bengal. Further east, Assam was effectively free from nastika~s and only Hs were flourishing. Nastika~s will regain lost ground in the following centuries.

In the west, nastika~s appear to be confined to the lower parts of Sindh and the Indus Delta and had a lot of sectarian troubles, which often turned violent. Xuanzang wasn’t fond of them at all, despite belonging to the same creed. Upper parts of Sindh were free from nastika presence, this has been attributed to the decline in trade after the fall of Guptas, whereafter Sassanids seized control over all routes & the introduction of sericulture in Byzantium. Once again, the Hunas are partly blamed for the destruction of monasteries here.

Up north, Xuanzang noted that nastika~s were losing ground in Multan and Sirhind but thriving in Jalandhar. Fa Xian noted a strong nastika presence in Swat Valley but by Xuanzang’s time, they were declining, although still far ahead of Hs. Similarly, Takshashila, Gandhara and Peshawar were full of ruins of monasteries when Xuanzang visited them, however, parts of northern upper Punjab were brimming with monasteries a century later and Gandhara continued to remain one as well. In Kashmir, nastika~s record the Huna King Mihirakula violently persecuting them, but its impact seems to be negligible. While nastika~s surely were out of their prime, they continued to dominate much of Kashmir and receive royal patronage.

Down south in Gujarat, Xuanzang noticed that temples outnumbered monasteries everywhere. The margin was excessive around Lata, barring Bharuch, while not so much in Saurashtra. In Maharashtra, nastika~s were rapidly losing ground despite having hundreds of monasteries. Even the famous establishment at Ajanta had been abandoned. This decline did not halt or reserve, but continued, with their complete disappearance by the eleventh century. Likewise in Andhra, nastika~s were slowly losing ground. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, barring Kanchipuram with a strong presence, nastika~s were effectively absent.

Overall, as we mentioned earlier, nastika~s had a strong presence in all 13 out of the 72 countries in India and were declining or had gone to ruin in about 52 of them. Some of these places, especially in the north-west and Bengal will see a recovery, but the bulk of them would bid adieu to nastik~s forever until modern times. On a final note: We’d like to remind everyone that this picture that we have painted, as we noted previously, is incomplete, and only observes the few urban centers across India, which were the primary dwellings of nastika~s. We’ll have to make do with this nonetheless as there do not appear to be any form of censuses with us, unlike the provisions prescribed by the great acharya Kautilya.

Although we’ve tried our best, some, if not many, identifications might be faulty here. Feel free to point the wrong ones out either on our Twitter account or in the comments below. We’ll release the data and computer program written in Python language for replication of the interactive maps as well for the benefit of interested people. Barring fields like theology, democraticizing knowledge always results in further advancement. Perhaps some interested reader would map Fa Xian and Hye Cho’s observations along with these, giving a more comprehensive visual understanding:
