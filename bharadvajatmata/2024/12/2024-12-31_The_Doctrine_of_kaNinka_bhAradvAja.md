> **The Background section is largely irrelavant can be skipped. I wrote > it because I find it important for myself.** There are a few references concerning China, I have chosen them instead of Indian parallels because a sizeable portion of my acquantainces on tw are sinophiles and I’d like to keep this relevant to them.

### Background

Coming across the 142nd chapter of the Adi Parva in Mahabharata was a significant blow to our worldview, which had largely been a liberal one for years, regarding the bulwark of Hism as a liberal religion as well. The sons of Pandu have set out on adventures in all directions and brought back tribute for their eldest brother Yudhishthira, who was the heir-apparent to the Kuru throne. Their growing might frightens the blind king Dhritarashtra, who wished for his sons to inherit the throne and not the sons of his brother Pandu. Both afraid and envious of Pandava's might, he calls upon his minister Kaninka Bharadvaja, a brahmana well versed in both traditions of Dharma and Artha. The author translates them as virtue and profit or success, and I learnt this only later. And so began Kaninka’s advice to king Dhritarashtra, who after learning political sciences resolves to burn the sons of Pandu alive. Thus, he approves of a conspiracy hatched by Shakuni, Duryodhana, Duhshasana and Kama, for the same in the next chapter.

The contents of his counsel were so radical and different from whatever little I’d learnt in my life about Hism that my mind outright refused to register them. The fact that they were openly available in the early sections of the most popular and only complete Mahabharata translation was even more shocking. I wondered if it was ever read by anyone at all, given how little attention had been paid to it. For the first time in my life, I started taking religious injunctions more seriously, and the image of our religion being barely separated from hippie liberals shattered then and there. In this short note, I’ll discuss some verses from the doctrine of their author and their historicity.

### Kaninka & The Artha Traditions

With the increase in state complexity as Aryas evolved from relatively primitive tribes to residents of urban centres, the needs of monarchs and social elites diversified. Such societies, unless they are running towards disaster, always hit a realization that physical coercion is an expensive means of organization and brutish head-on warfare can only take you far. With the establishment of offices and courts in cities to administrate lands, competing poles of power arise and thus rises the need to efficiently manage them, both internally and externally. Herein, the need for learning in politics arises. Much like China during the warring states period where it had a Hundred Schools of Thought, in India we find many Artha traditions growing alongside Dharma ones. Given the nature of debates, one could perhaps conjecture them to be rival ones even though surviving literature is scarce and unable to portray such a picture.

Thus, we find that oral traditions begun by wandering ascetics eventually turn into schools or become famous by the name of their great students. As is the case for most noteworthy things in Ancient India, Kautilya’s treatise is a mine of information here. Kautilya’s Arthashastra itself begins with a salutation to Acharyas (teachers) of the past, drawing on whose Arthashastra his own is composed. However, since his Arthashastra was the most superior one to be produced in comparison with his predecessors and his successors, the treatise started being identified only with him eventually. Across his treatise, there are references to schools possibly following an oral tradition namely Bārhaspatya~s, Auśanasa~s, Mānava~s, Pārāśara~s, and Āmbhīya~s. Among these, we are aware that Bārhaspatya~s, Auśanasa~s and Mānava~s were indeed real and popular Artha traditions of the past. The Mānava~s are quite possibly the ancestors of the singular compiler of Manusmrti in the late 2nd century BCE. Apart from that, the Mahabharata narrates that Bhagwan Brahma created a treatise on statecraft and politics himself, which constituted over ten thousand chapters. This treatise was given to us humans who redacted it again and again over time, and finally, two separate editions crafted by Brhaspati and Ushanas, branching out of the single text by Brahma were created. The Nastika scholar Ashvagosha in his Buddhacharita also declares that Brhaspati and Ushanas (mentioned as Shukra here), had composed treatises on statecraft that their ancestors couldn’t. Such an account independent of mythology can be believed to be historic in light of other references we have to them. Since Ashvagosha lived in the first century, said treatises would have to be earlier than that period. Unfortunately, none of their works survives today barring some ambitious reconstructions.

AI imagination of Kautilya debating with the various teachers at Takshashila.

The most glaring example of such loss is the Kharapaṭṭa, mentioned in KAS IV.8. In this chapter, after briefly speaking on the eighteen kinds of torture, Kautilya asks the reader to refer to the work Kharapaṭṭa to learn more about the instruments used, the extent to which torture should be carried out, how it is to be carried out and the restrictions and prognosis of each kind of torture. Similarly, just like the schools and works, we also find individual acharyas mentioned, with whom Kautilya is seen debating. It is hard to determine whether they are his contemporaries or whether Kautilya is giving their arguments in the traditional Purvapaksha-Uttarpaksha form, possibly after learning from their followers. Some of these teachers named are Bhāradvāja, Viśālākṣa, Piśuna, Kauṇapadanta, Vātavyādhi, and Bāhudantīputra. Among these, the debates where Bhāradvāja is present will be of particular interest to us. Barring some rare cases of agreement, Kautilya usually refutes the various points made by his opponents and then proceeds to elaborate upon what is correct conduct. To give an example of one such debate —

> “He should appoint his fellow students as ministers, because their integrity and competence is known to him,” states Bhāradvāja; “for he can have confidence in them.” >
> “No,” says Viśālākṣa; “because they have played with him, they will > treat him with disrespect. He should appoint as ministers individuals > who share the same mindset as he with respect to secret matters, because they have the same good and evil propensities as he. Because they fear that he knows their vulnerabilities, they will not work against him.” >
> “This drawback is mutual,” says Pārāśara; “because he fears that they > too know his vulnerabilities, he will put up with what they do or omit > to do. A king will come under the power of as many people as he > reveals a secret to, becoming powerless because of that act. “He should appoint as ministers those who have supported him during calamities that threatened his life, because they have demonstrated their loyalty.” >
> “No,” says Piśuna; “that is devotion and not the quality of > intelligence. He should appoint as ministers those who, when they have been employed in tasks whose income has been calculated, would realize the projected amount or even more, because they have demonstrated their quality.” >
> “No,” says Kauṇapadanta; “for they do not possess other qualities of a > minister. He should appoint as ministers those who have come down from > his father and grandfather, because he has witnessed their > achievements. For they will not abandon him even when he behaves improperly, because of their ‘common smell.’ This is seen even among nonhuman beings, for cows, disregarding a cattle herd without a common smell, reside only among those with a common smell.” >
> “No,” says Vātavyādhi; “for they will bring under their grip all his > affairs and act like lords themselves. Therefore, he should appoint as ministers new individuals well versed in governmental affairs. Now, new individuals consider the dispenser of punishment as occupying the place of Yama and will not work against him.” >
> “No,” says Bāhudantīputra; “one who knows the science but has no > practical experience will become confounded when confronted with practical tasks. Therefore, he should appoint as ministers individuals who are endowed with high birth, intellect, integrity, bravery, and loyalty, because quality has to be paramount.” >
> “All that is appropriate,” says Kauṭilya; “for the capability of an > individual is measured by his capability to carry out undertakings.” In accordance with their capabilities, moreover, he should allocate ministerial ranks, as also the place, time, and activity, and then appoint all these as ministers, but not as counselors. >
> — KAS I.VIII

While the doctrines of the opposing teachers are presented rather dogmatically, which is expected, there are still enough quotations to compare whether they agree with the principle presented by another text. The Arthashastra isn’t the sole treatise where such discourses are stored. The Mahabharata is particularly useful in this regard and we believe it to be possible to trace the evolution of such Artha traditions through it when put together with Kautilya’s treatise. Now, we find that the Bharadvaja seer mentioned across Kautilya’s treatise is called by his name in KAS 5.5.11 as Kaṇiṅka Bhāradvāja. One would feel inclined to quickly draw a connection between him and the Kaninka Bharadvaja, the minister of Dhritarashtra, whom we mentioned in the background section of this essay. However, we are immediately met with difficulty to reconcile Dhritarashtra’s minister with Kautilya’a colleague, who lived some 700 years after the former. Furthermore, we also find another Kaninka Bharadvaja presented in the Shanti Parvan as a minister of the King of Sauvira, Shatrunjaya. Now we are left with a two-pronged problem, one is to identify whether the three Kaninkas in question are indeed the same person and the other is to reconcile our chronology with the anachronistic mentions to trace the evolution of Kaninka’a Artha tradition accurately.

Gita Press Art: Kaninka advises Dhritarashtra; source: [Abhinav Agarwal](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-McLoUQKPCP0/X7IXMw-Yi6I/AAAAAAAASSA/YwBi2kK8uPAjThXh93hWNR8qfly8UkLaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/KN-1.png)

For this, we shall take help from the doyens of Indology and Mahabharata studies like V.S. Sukhtankar, M.R. Yardi and M. Winternitz. Winternitz, following Sukhtankar in his creation of the critical edition of the Adi Parvan, has rejected the passages which were referred to as Kaninkaniti. The basis for doing so was the fact that it was missing from Sukhtankar’s collection of the Javanese manuscripts of the Mahabharata and Devabodha’s commentary, it was also not referred to in Kshemendra’s Bharatamanjari. The Kaninkaniti of Adi Parva surely does give an impression of originality and also expands on a few points left ambiguous in the Kaninkopadesha in Shanti Parva. Still, as Sukhtankar notes, it is very clearly a later insertion which conveniently weaved Kaninka as a minister to a Dhritarashtra in distress. The Kaninkaniti of Adi Parva contains 80 shlokas while the Kaninkopadesha of the Shanti Parva has 63 shlokas. Out of the 80 in Kaninkaniti, 25 belong to the tale of the jackal, which is used to demonstrate how “sma, dama, danda, bheda” can be employed in practice. From the remaining 65, we find 33 shlokas common in both Kaninkaniti of Adi Parva and Kaninkopadesha of Shanti Parva. The content delivered in both is similar nonetheless. Concerning their similarity with the Kaninka of KAS, we’d like to especially draw attention to the following verses:

> “He who trusteth in a foe who hath been brought under subjection by force, summoneth his own death as a crab by her act of conception”  
> — *“Kaninkaniti”, Adi Parva, MBh I.142 Vulgate Edition* >
> “That king who does not crush a foe reduced to subjection by military force, provides for his own death like the crab when she conceives”  
> — *“Kaninkopadesha”, Shanti Parva, Mbh VII.138 BORI Critical Edition* >
> \[These were identical verses translated differently\] >
> “From their very birth, he should maintain surveillance of princes, > for princes and crabs share the same nature; they eat their progenitors. Before love toward them has been kindled in the father, it is best to subject them to silent punishment (1.11.21),” so states Bhāradvāja.   
> *— KAS I.17.4-6*

All three verses here taken from different sources of Kaninka’s discourses give the example of matriphagy in crabs in the context of being lenient in dealing with one’s inferior, be it a subjugated foe or a son. It is noteworthy that this example is repeated only twice elsewhere in the BORI Mahabharata and even in other literature it is hard to find. That such a rare example finds itself repeated in three sources, all of whom are dealing with Kaninka is effectively a confirmation that they are talking about the same person. On a tangential note, as Shri Manasataramgini has noted [here](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/828431420825731072), the crabs in question might not necessarily be crabs but spiders:

> I too have wondered on the snippet of H zoology in amara's lexicon & > the same commentary by kShIrasvAmin that Sundara Rajan talks about > here. For instance was intending at some point to write a note on the > peculiar term kulIra. kulIra is described as exhibiting matriphagy & > is typically understood as crab, as the citation from kauTilya. > However, to my knowledge such matriphagy is known in a crustacean. > However, certain Indian crabs have been described as displaying > parental care carrying young. On the other hand I've seen apparent > matriphagy by a spider right on the IISc campus as youth. Matriphagy > does exist in Indian spiders making 1 wonder if this is what was > behind kulIra later conflated with a crab. Indeed some spiders showing matriphagy are called "crab spiders". Likewise amarasiMha & kshIrasvAmin also seem to group the marine mammals together record an animal sha~Nkvant which is a beaked whale.

The aforementioned is just one of the similarities which we shall discuss later. Now that we’ve confirmed that these Kaninkas all belong to the same tradition, which was started by some Kaninka, the question of their chronology arises. To do so, we shall refer to the works of Shri M.R. Yardi who performed a statistical analysis of Anuṣṭubh and Triṣṭubh ślokas using syllable count. The discussion of the methodology is out of the scope here, however, it should be noted that he successfully identified five recensions in the BORI critical edition of the Mahabharata. The layers identified being —

1.  Original Bharata of Vaishampayana, who recited it to Janamejaya.

2.  Alpha recension of Sūta, the father of Sauti.

3.  B recension of Sauti, writing around ~452 BCE

4.  C recension of the Harivaṁśakāra, writing around 180-120 BCE in the
    Śunga Era after the Mauryan collapse.

5.  Beta recension of the Parvasaṅgrahakāra. Many variations exist but
    not later than the first century.

For ease of access and future reference for readers, I shall attach a table of his results from statistical analysis herein as well:

Anexxture A & B from Yardi 1986: Mbh Adhyayas arranged by Recension

From this table, we find that the 138th chapter of Shanti Parva, which is our Kaninkopadesha is present in the Vaishampayana Bharata. Thus, separated only by two generations from the Bharata war, its contents can be trusted as authentic sources of their contemporary history. Thus, we learn that the Bharadvaja seer Kaninka lived in the Sauvira country and advised their King Shatrunjaya, expectedly some 2900 years ago, around 900 BCE. The seer, either through his students or his sons would become the foundation of an Artha tradition, the disciples of which will debate Kautilya some six hundred years later around 300 BCE. Concerning the dating of the Kaninkaniti text, we would like to draw attention to these verses —

> “The king should see that his own spies are not recognised by his foe. He should make spies of atheists and ascetics and send them to the territories of his enemies.”  
> — Kaninkopadesha >
> “Thy spies in foreign kingdoms should be apt deceivers and persons in > the garb of ascetics. Thy spies should be placed in gardens, places of > amusement, temples and other holy places, drinking halls, streets, and with the (eighteen) Aṣṭādaśa-tīrtha~s, and in places of sacrifice, near wells, on mountains and in rivers, in forests, and in all places where people congregate.”  
> — Kaninkaniti >
> “In this manner, he should spread out spies among his enemy, his ally, the intermediate king, and the neutral king (6.2.13–22), as well as among their Aṣṭādaśa-tīrtha~s.”  
> — KAS 1.12.20

The Pradesh only recommends that atheists and ascetics be sent to enemy territories as spies, whereas the Niti elaborates further upon it, adding a few places of interest and the Aṣṭādaśa-tīrtha~s. These Aṣṭādaśa-tīrtha~s are also mentioned by Kautilya, who is, in my knowledge, the first to use this phrase, which refers to the eighteen high officials of critical importance. Thus, it is quite likely that the author of the Niti was someone aware of Kautilya’s treatise or lived close to his times. We’ll believe it was the former since this text has been excluded from the BORI edition, it must’ve taken place after the Parvasangrahakara recension. Another text of importance during this period is Vishnu Sharma’s Panchatantra, which was undoubtedly a popular and well-known text by the third century. We are aware that this text was an instant hit, and by the 1500s, this text itself or its variations were available across Scotland, Iceland, Turkey, Egypt, Mongolia and Java. While fables relating to animals could be far older, we don’t see them in treatises on politics until the Panchatantra came to this scene and became an instant hit. Thus, we posit that the twenty-five shlokas dedicated to the story of the Jackal suggest that the disciples in Kaninka’s tradition were influenced by the Panchatantra, which was a popular treatise by then.

To sum up, we propose the following chronology in the evolution of Kaninka’s Artha tradition:

1.  ~900 BC: There existed the seer Kaninka Bharadvaja, who lived in the
    Sauvira country and advised the King Shatrunjaya or Shatruntapa. His
    sons or disciples pass down his teachings orally and evolve them
    when necessary. The great seer Vaishampayana attaches Kaninka’s
    teachings in the Bharata epic in its Shanti Parva. These were
    possibly known to the great Kuru patriarch Bhishma, who is the
    narrator of his discourses in the Epic.

2.  ~300 BC: Students of Kaninka’s tradition have either codified his
    teachings or continue to pass them orally. The great seer Kautilya
    is aware of these and debates with them. Parts of these discourses
    find their way into Kautilya’s Arthashastra.

3.  ~200 AD: Kaninka’s Artha tradition is continued so far and was
    inevitably influenced by the two giants of those times, namely,
    Kautilya’s Arthashastra and Vishnusharman’s Panchatantra. Herein,
    the story of the Jackal deceiving his enemies is added, giving a
    practical example of the seer’s advice: *“Hence, of the four
    requisites of rule, viz., Conciliation, Gift, Disunion, and
    Chastisement, Chastisement is said to be the foremost.”* This story
    makes its way into some northern and eastern recensions, where
    Kaninka is very cautiously weaved into the narrative of the Adi
    Parva as Dhritarashtra’s minister but fails to diffuse southwards or
    even towards Kashmir later. As is the case with most in India, this
    tradition too ended up going extinct at some point later.

### A Few Glimpses of Kaninka’s Doctrine:

As noted previously in the background section, Kaninka’s doctrine was shocking to an illiterate me. Nonetheless, knowing that I wasn’t the only one shocked by the sheer cruelty of it was quite relieving. The great seer Kautilya is today renowned in western circles to be a “*truly harsh and radical Machiavellian,*” in the words of Max Weber. And in ancient India too, as seen in the poetry of Baṇa Bhaṭṭa in his Kadambari, who conveniently puts his words in the mouth of one Arya Shukanasa:

> These princes rely entirely on the extremely cruel and merciless > Kautilya Shastra for their governance. Their priests too are of the pitiless kind who would organize terrible rites to bring about the destruction of others. The only ministers whose advice they accept are those that are experts in the art of deception.

But we find that even Kautilya is shocked by the ruthless opportunism of Kaninka as he himself and another acharya Vishalaksha label Kaninka cruel and unrighteous on two occasions. The first one has been discussed in part previously where he gives the example of matriphagy in spider-crabs:

> The king can protect the kingdom only when he is protected from those > close to him and from enemies, but first of all from his wives and > sons. We will explain the surveillance of wives in “Regimen for the > Residence”. With respect to the surveillance of sons, however— “From > their very birth, he should maintain surveillance of princes, for princes and crabs share the same nature; they eat their progenitors. Before love toward them has been kindled in the father, it is best to subject them to silent punishment (1.11.21 n.),” so states Bhāradvāja. >
> That is cruel; it involves the killing of the innocent and the eradication of the Kṣatriya race,” says Viśālākṣa. “Therefore, it is best to confine them in one location.”  
> — KAS I.17

Here, we find him recommending strict surveillance of princes from the very moment they are born. He further recommends “silent punishment”, a euphemism for secret assassination in case their father, the king, ends up being emotionally attached towards his sons. Since the princes are the biggest threats to the king, they should either be kept at an arms distance with sufficient surveillance or be killed before they receive the love of their father. Acharya Vishalaksha however disagrees and calls him cruel for making such suggestions. Among the Legalists in China, we find a similar sentiment which matches that presented by Kaninka. To paraphrase a few retrofitted members of the Fajia (Legalists):

> As a consequence, the wise ruler must assume that no one—including mother, wife and child—is ‘trustworthy’, ‘Queens, concubines, and princesses crave the death of their rulers.’  
> — Han Fei Zi 1.46

The entire discourse involved inputs from all teachers and is too lengthy to be discussed here. Kautilya too differs from Han Fei and Kaninka, and his input is too lengthy to be discussed. But I believe that a part of it contains perhaps the first example of psychological conditioning and I’d do an injustice to the readers by depriving them of it:

> The secret agents, on the contrary, should guard him, saying, “We are > yours.” If he sets his mind on other people’s wives out of youthful > insolence, they should make him recoil by introducing him at night in > deserted houses to squalid women posing as Ārya ladies. If he takes a > fancy for liquor, they should make him recoil by administering a > doctored drink. If he takes a fancy for gambling, they should make him > recoil with the help of crafty student agents (1.11.1 n.). If he takes > a fancy for hunting, they should frighten him through agents posing as > bandits. If he sets his mind on attacking his father, they should gain > his trust by saying, “Yes,” and then thwart him, saying, “It’s not > right for you to attack the king. If you fail, you will be killed. If you succeed, you will be heading to hell, there will be fury, and the people will smash you like a clod.” They should inform on him if he is disaffected.  
> — KAS I.17

Here, secret agents induce a distaste in the prince’s mind concerning vices by attaching them to dangerous or disgusting things. If the prince wishes to covet another’s wife, he is to be left with squalid women for coitus at night. If he fancies liquor, he should be given doctored drinks so that he avoids them; if he fancies gambling, he should be made to lose so that he quits it; if he fancies hunting then an attack by bandits should be staged so that he avoids it in the future. Kautilya is even willing to send him agents to entice a prince into killing his father and then thwart him by revealing the consequences.

What is noteworthy here is that throughout Kautilya’s treatise, we find that ministers are independent actors in the state, while some advice is indeed rendered directly to the king, the bulk of the text revolves around what a great minister ought to do. Thus, we can find Kaninka seemingly calling shots at the lives of princes behind the back of the king. This minister-centric characteristic will be witnessed again. In another instance, we find none other than Kautilya himself calling Kaninka unrighteous (adharmic).

> “When a calamity has befallen the king within an enemy territory, he > should negotiate a pact with the foe using an ally in the guise of an > enemy and then retreat. Alternatively, he should install one of > these—a neighboring lord and so forth—in his fort and then retreat. Or > else, he should anoint a prince and then counterattack.

Kaninka here advises that if the King cannot be rescued from enemy territory, it is best that the minister seizes control after arranging a massacre between the many factions in the court. Kautilya, however, isn't convinced and calls him unrighteous since such plans are uncertain and often lead to revolts by the constituents. One could say that discourses like these are precisely why legalists in China had paranoia regarding ministers and eunuchs. Their doctrine held that ministers only work for their own favour and the King must never trust them. That they are akin to tapeworms, attack dogs and bad medicine for the King, whose interests will always be in conflict with those of the ministers.

This discourse also contains a verse similar to which is seen in the Kaninkopadesha, further confirming that they belong to the same tradition:

> Time comes but once to a man who is waiting for his time; that time is hard to come by for him when he wants to accomplish a task. — KAS >
> When the time for happiness has presented itself, those who are intelligent do not think it is good policy to shun it, in the hope of future happiness — Mbh

The discourse (KAS V.6) here may superficially seem to be one between righteousness and unrighteousness. However, I believe Kaninka's words do hold some merit to them and we shouldn’t see them as mere unthrottled opportunism but as a practical disposition in statecraft. Kings are often accompanied by powerful ministers in the court who are more involved in handling the affairs of the country if not entirely eclipsed by them. When the monarch goes missing with no confirmed heir in sight, a war between the various factions is bound to break out for control of the throne. If not, a puppet monarch would be put on the throne and would be controlled by powerful ministers. Furthermore, when the monarch grows up and wishes to take the reins himself, once again there is a political struggle involved. The eunuch Zhao Gao seizing power after the First Emperor’s death and Lu Buwei being made the regent for a young Ying Zheng are stark examples of this. Finally, as we discussed in a previous essay[here](https://bharadvajatmaja.substack.com/p/technological-evolution-and-inferences), political dynamism is always good to remove sterility from culture and ensure that the latest advancements in all fields are adopted quickly, leading to a prosperous nation. Thus, the recommendation that the anchor minister should pre-emptively strike and seize power for himself isn’t mere opportunism but a crude way of releasing internal stresses from a Kingdom and crafting a strong central state anew. However, Kautilya’s criticism is astute as usual, you can never be certain whether such dynamism would result in never-ending revolts and civil wars like the Roman Republic or The Crisis of the Third Century, or whether they’ll lead to golden ages like those of Tang and Song. In case of uncertainty, a treatise should avoid potentially harmful ideas like these.

Probability of being deposed as a Chinese Emperor: by [@YuhuaWang5](https://twitter.com/YuhuaWang5) on Twitter

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A noteworthy aspect of the text is that it is weaved in a manner to appeal to a weaker king, or someone in a very fragile position, who cannot confront his enemies directly even if forced to, who is but a servant of his superior. Thus, we often find submission, feigning weakness and humility as tools of deception and overcoming one’s enemies. His polar opposite is Vishalaksha who suggests a glorious death on the battlefield, befitting Kshatriyas, while Kautilya takes a more nuanced position as usual.

> “When a weaker king is attacked by a stronger king, he should remain submissive in all circumstances, assuming the characteristics of a reed; for he who bows before a stronger king bows before Indra,” so says Bhāradvāja >
> “Gathering together all his troops, he should fight; for prowess triumphs over a calamity. This is also the specific duty of a Kṣatriya: victory or defeat in war,” so says Viśālākṣa. >
> “No,” says Kauṭilya. “A man who is submissive in all circumstances > remains with no interest in life, like a herd ram, while a man with > few troops who engages in a fight flounders like a man without a boat plunging into the ocean. On the contrary, he should keep on striving after taking refuge either with a king who is superior to the other or in an impregnable fort.”

Thus, the subject is told that a king is feared and his law is implemented only when he is ever ready to strike, with his mace uplifted. The king should conceal his flaws like a tortoise and passionately pursue those of his enemies. All acts once begun should be carried out completely, for a thorn which is extracted unwholly, leaves behind a festering sore. Unlike modern Hs who’ve excessively made a virtue out of forgiveness, Kaninka argues that slaughtering a foe is always praiseworthy, even if he begs for mercy piteously; and even his family, friends and partisans should be executed:

> The slaughter of a foe who doeth thee evil is always praiseworthy. >
> When thy foe is in thy power, destroy him by every means open or secret. Do not show him any mercy, although he seeketh thy protection. >
> A foe, or one that hath once injured thee, should be destroyed by lavishing money, if necessary, for by killing him thou mayest be at thy ease. >
> Thou must destroy the three, five and seven (resources) of thy foes. Thou must destroy thy foes root and branch. Then shouldst thou destroy their allies and partisans. >
> The allies and partisans can never exist if the principal be destroyed. If the root of the tree is torn up, the branches and twigs can never exist as before.

The same is to be applied against a kingdom which is hostile:

> By slaughtering its population, by tearing up its roads and otherwise injuring them, and by burning and pulling down its houses, a king should destroy a hostile kingdom.

And if one’s own family or Guru turns against them, they should be slain as well without any mercy, we are reminded of the Bhagavad Gita from this:

> If thy son, friend, brother, father, or even the spiritual preceptor, anyone becometh thy foe, thou shouldst, if desirous of prosperity, slay him without scruples.

Kaninka also clears any possible misunderstandings that arise from such recommendations, it is not that Dharma is not to be followed, but that one must do so after raising themselves in power:

> When one falls into distress, one should raise one's self by all means in one's power, mild or stern; and after such rise, when competent, one should practise righteousness. >
> He that hath never been afflicted with calamity can never have prosperity. This may be seen in the life of one who surviveth his calamities.

Nor is murder and deception ever unjustified for the king who seeks to create a prosperous kingdom. Just like a fisherman who kills fish for sustenance, a king too must be ready to commit great evils for prosperity.

> Like a fisherman who becometh prosperous by catching and killing fish, a king can never grow prosperous without tearing the vitals of his enemy and without doing some violent deeds.

No enemy should ever be disregarded no matter who he may be, for even a spark can cause a forest fire. Alternatively, taking the former advice alone, we argue that all enemies must be assessed objectively even if they are contemptible. Many modern Hs have the tendency to dismiss the merits of their enemies, just on account of them being contemptible, something witnessed one too many times among medieval Hs as well.

> O sire, an enemy should never be scorned, however contemptible. >
> A spark of fire is capable of consuming an extensive forest if only it can spread from one object to another in proximity.

Barring foes, it is necessary for the king to punish his constituents too who commit evil. It was common knowledge that heinous offenders take the garb of ascetics to hide their crimes, something witnessed at all political levels in modern India. The king should also never let atheists dwell in his kingdom.

> Thou shouldst equally smite the heinous offender who liveth by the practice of virtue, for the garb of virtue simply covereth his offences like black clouds covering the mountains. >
> Thou shouldst burn the house of that person whom thou punishest with death. >
> And thou shouldst never permit beggars and atheists and thieves to dwell in thy kingdom.

In the case, the king is unable to punish them, he should instead look away from their faults and refuse to act against them. This is extremely important because a king would paint a target on his back if he orders a punishment but is unable to execute it. However, the king can hide his faults and weakness by feigning blindness and deafness to such flaws. In such a scenario, the ambiguity that those who go against the king are safe only because their faults are yet to be discovered and not because the king is impotent would keep the omnipotent image of the king alive.

> Kings should sometimes feign blindness and deafness, for if impotent to chastise, they should pretend not to notice the faults that call for chastisement. >
> On occasions, such as these, let them regard their bows as made of straw. But they should be always on the alert like a herd of deer sleeping in the woods.

Concerning one’s behaviour as the weaker king, one should always be humble and speak sweet words, even when faced with people who seek one’s destruction. One’s speech should be humble and inspire hope and confidence in one’s enemy.

> If thou art angry, show thyself as if thou art not so, speaking even then with a smile on thy lips. Never reprove any one with indications of anger in thy speech. >
> In speech thou shouldst ever be humble, but let thy heart be ever sharp as razor. And when thou art engaged in doing even a very cruel and terrible act, thou shouldst talk with smiles on thy lips.

Likewise, even one’s conduct should be very humble, going as far as to prostrate in front of your superior and worship their feet, even if at heart one wants to butcher them.

> Worshipping the feet of others by lowering thy head, inspiring hope, and the like.

Thus, the king should make combined use of humility, sweet speech, feigning weakness and virtue to lead his enemies into a trap, from where he can spring upon them like a wolf.

> By maintaining the perpetual fire by sacrifices, by brown cloths, by > matted locks, and by hides of animals for thy bedding, shouldst thou at first gain the confidence of thy foes, and when thou has gained it thou shouldst then spring upon them like a wolf. >
> For it hath been said that in the acquisition of wealth even the garb of holiness might be employed as a hooked staff to bend down a branch in order to pluck the fruits that are ripe. >
> Comforting thy foe by conciliation, by gift of wealth, and smooth behaviour, thou must smite him when he walketh not aright.

And if one is reduced to service, he should carry his master on his shoulder faithfully for as long until he finds the correct opportunity to violently destroy them once and for all. The Sima clan grudgingly served Wei Cao~s faithfully, until they seized power from them on the Qingming of 249 AD. Pushyamitra Shunga served the Mauryan emperors for a long time until finally seizing power on the eve of the Greek invasions.

> Bear thy foe upon thy shoulders till the time cometh when thou canst throw him down, breaking him into pieces like an earthen pot thrown down with violence upon a stony surface.

Even when one is killing their enemies, they mustn’t dirty their tongue with hatred and only let flowery words flow. And as they sever the heads of their enemies, they should grieve for them and shed tears.

> And O Bharata, speak soft words before thou smitest and even while thou art smiting! >
> After the smiting is over, pity the victim, and grieve for him, and even shed tears. >
> Having struck off one's head with his sword, he should grieve and shed tears.

To this, we recall a popular fictional episode of Kongming delivering a eulogy for his departed enemy Zhou Yu after causing his death in battle. On a final note, we would like to point out that despite Kaninka’s smooth and calm approach to even contemptible enemies, he held anger to be the quality of a righteous man.

> Anger is the characteristic of a righteous man. It is the foundation of bravery; it puts an end to despicable persons; and it keeps the people under fear.

Many modern H from all political spectrums find it very convenient to casually dismiss mainstream orthodox Hism as some hippie's “make love not war” line of thought for a variety of reasons. Some even argue that it alone is the cause of their decline, we’d ask them to wonder if scriptural injunctions from any other religion would approve of such tact…
