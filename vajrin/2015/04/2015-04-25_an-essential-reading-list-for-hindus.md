An essential reading list for Hindus

**Background note**

I wasasked to create a sort of “essential reading” by multiple
compatriots so Iput the following together. In myexperience the modern
Hindus are rather lazy and disinclined to read anything unless it is
something along the lines of “One Night in a Call Center”.
ThereforeIlimited the list to what Ifelt wasessential reading
material keeping in mind the current situation that we Hindus face. In
addition, Iassume some familiarity with basic texts such as Ramayana,
and thus did not include them. MyHindi is rather middling and certainly
not good enough to read books, so while I amsure there are many good
books in Hindi, I am not a proficient Hindi reader. I can read, write,
and speak Telugu fluently, so perhaps I may make a separate post later
on for Telugu readers with books of interest I came across.

In this list I have tried to cover a range of books and articles on
different subjects which I felt were essential reading for Hindus and
may help our continued existence as a civilization.Readers may also
note the books on China and Japan which are important civilizations for
Hindus to understand, especially with the current rise of the Han empire
with global ambitions. Particular attention must be paid to the “Anti
Foreignism…” book by Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi because it contains a full
translation of the great Japanese thinker Aizawa Seishisai’s Shinron
(New Theses) which in my view must be compulsory reading for the navel
gazing Hindu elite alongside our own classics.

If the books/articles are available online even partly, I provided
links.
