How Japan dealt with the Christian Threat

We have touched on the topic before
(<https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/japans-defeat-of-christianity-lessons-for-hindus/>)
& advise people to read that piece first before reading this one. We
hope to briefly cover the actual measures that the Tokugawa Shogunate
employed to suppress Christianity. The Japanese employed a range of
measures for this because they correctly saw Christianity as a very
serious threat intent on destroying their civilization. The following
list covers each method only briefly and those interested may look up
more information in the relevant books.

The below are the various methods that were utilized by the Japanese
government to wipe out Christianity from Japan before the Christians
could destroy Japan. Naturally some of this may seem cruel & Christian
propagandists have tried their best to exaggerate their suffering &
paint themselves as victims. But it must be remembered that the
Christians were the aggressors who used forcible conversion (when a
daimyo converted he imposed Christianity on the populace under his
rule), destruction of Shinto shrines & Buddhist temples, and even armed
struggle (Shimabara uprising) to take over Japan. All this was done
after taking advantage of the openness & religious tolerance of the
Japanese, and the ongoing civil war in Japan. In fact the Christians
were warned by Hideyoshi in his proclamation banning missionaries not to
indulge in such tactics while continuing them to permit to trade. But
far from listening to his warning they even upped the ante & started
interfering in local politics, fighting among themselves (the Spanish
Franciscans vs. Portuguese Jesuits with the former surpassing the latter
in their fanaticism), and were even rumored to be laying the groundwork
for the invasion of Japan by a Spanish Armada. Considering all this, it
is no surprise that the Japanese reacted as they did. The only surprise
is that they tolerated this nonsense for 90 years though the civil war
may have been one reason for this delay. Lafcadio Hearn commented as
follows on these events:

> With the massacre of Shimabara ends the real history of the Portuguese
> and Spanish missions. After that event, Christianity was slowly,
> steadily, implacably stamped out of visible existence. It had been
> tolerated, or half-tolerated, for only sixty-five years: the entire
> history of its propagation and destruction occupies a period of
> scarcely ninety years. People of nearly every rank, from prince to
> pauper, suffered for it; thousands endured tortures for its sake –
> tortures so frightful that even three of those Jesuits who sent
> multitudes to useless martyrdom were forced to deny their faith under
> the infliction;\* and tender women, sentenced to, the stake, carried
> their little ones with them into the fire, rather than utter the words
> that would have saved both mother and child. **Yet this religion, for
> which thousands vainly died, had brought to Japan nothing but evil
> disorders, persecutions, revolts, political troubles, and war.** Even
> those virtues of the people which had been evolved at unutterable cost
> for the protection and conservation of society, – their self-denial,
> their faith, their loyalty, their constancy and courage, – were by
> this black creed distorted, diverted, and transformed into forces
> directed to the destruction of that society. **Could that destruction
> have been accomplished, and a new Roman Catholic empire have been
> founded upon the ruins, the forces of that empire would have been used
> for the further extension of priestly tyranny, the spread of the
> Inquisition, the perpetual Jesuit warfare against freedom of
> conscience and human progress.** Well may we pity the victims of this
> pitiless faith, and justly admire their useless courage: yet who can
> regret that their cause was lost? … Viewed from another standpoint
> than that of religious bias, and simply judged by its results, the
> Jesuit effort to Christianize Japan must be regarded as a crime
> against humanity, a labour of devastation, a calamity comparable only,
> – by reason of the misery and destruction which it wrought, – to an
> earthquake, a tidal-wave, a volcanic eruption.

It would also be helpful to imagine the scenario in reverse i.e. Shinto
missionaries landing up in 16^(th) century Europe, preaching that only
Shinto was the true faith, destroying churches, telling the native
converts their first loyalty to should be to the Emperor in Kyoto not
the Pope in Rome or their King. The scenario is farfetched (for a start
because Shinto is neither intrinsically evil like Christianity nor
missionary oriented) but if it did happen, imagine the reaction of the
European Christians who were busy slaughtering each other over sectarian
squabbles. But this is exactly what the Christians did in Japan (as they
did/are doing now in India) and they have the audacity to portray
themselves as victims!

In a subsequent post we shall do a comparitive analysis about the
response of Hindus, Japanese, Romans, & Chinese to the Christian threat
which will show why the Japanese were by far superior in their response.

**1) Deportation**

The Shogunate deported many missionaries foreign & domestic, prominent
native converts, and mixed children to Portuguese controlled Macau or
Spanish Manila. This was to deprive Christians of prominent leaders such
as the daimyo (warlord) Takayama Ukon
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Justo_Takayama>). The mixed children
(products of marriages between the Spanish/Portuguese & Japanese Xtians)
were dreaded. Lafcadio Hearn provides an explanation for this measure:

> The policy of isolation, – of shutting off Japan from the rest of the
> world, – as adopted by Hidetada and maintained by his successors,
> sufficiently indicates the fear that religious intrigues had inspired.
> Not only were all foreigners, excepting the Dutch traders, expelled
> from the country; all half-breed children of Portuguese or Spanish
> blood were also expatriated, Japanese families being forbidden to
> adopt or conceal any of them, under penalties to be visited upon all
> the members of the household disobeying. In 1636 two hundred and
> eighty-seven half-breed children were shipped to Macao. It is possible
> that the capacity of half-breed children to act as interpreters was
> particularly dreaded; but there can be little doubt that, at the time
> when this ordinance was issued, race-hatred had been fully aroused by
> religious antagonism. After the Shimabara episode all Western
> foreigners, without exception, were regarded with unconcealed
> distrust.

**2) Torture**

If words did not work then torture was the next preferred method and was
used extensively with great success. Initially the Japanese started
executing the Christians but they soon realized that Christians have a
fetish for martyrs and would go to great lengths to worship their
relics. Therefore they switched to torture for the following reason:

> As mentioned before, the preferred result was when Christians were
> captured was that they would renounce their faith and live their lives
> as Buddhists. According to George Elison, Inoue Chikugo-no-Kami
> Masashige “wants not martyrs, but apostates. Apostates better than
> martyrs attest the impotence of a religion, especially when those
> apostates had been apostles of the faith and priests.” After they
> renounced their faith, priests were forced to take wives as part of
> their new lives and were constantly monitored by the authorities. If
> renunciation was not forthcoming through torture, however, the final
> act would be execution.

Most Christians simply became apostates under torture and the most
famous catch of this program was the Jesuit missionary Cristovao
Ferreira (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o_Ferreira>)
whose five hour ordeal not only cured him of a lifetime of Christian
delusion but also seems to have spurred him into warning others against
the deadly poison known as Christianity. He not only became an apostate
but also wrote a tract exposing Christianity & took part in the trials
of other captured Jesuits.

The tortures used covered a whole range from beatings to having boiling
water poured on them at hot springs to standing in freezing water during
winter. The most famous torture was tsurushi (this was what Ferreira was
subjected to for five hours) which is described here:

> At last they found a more hellish and exquisite way of torturing than
> before; they hung these sufferers by the heels, their heads in pits,
> which to give the blood some vent, they slasht lightly cross-waies,
> (but they do that now no more), and in this posture they live several
> daies, ten or twelve, and speak sensibly to the very last: The
> greatness of this torment surpasseth all other, being beyond all
> humaine strength to suffer and be undergone; but by such who are
> extraordinarilie strengthened from above. This extremitie hath indeed
> (by reason of its continuance) forced many to renounce their religion;
> and some of them who had hung two or three daies, assured me that the
> pains they endured were wholly unsufferable, no fire nor no torture
> equalling their langour and violence.

**3) Death penalty**

The death penalty was a last resort after torture failed to secure
apostasy and various means were employed from simple beheading to
crucifixion to being beaten to death. Once the Japanese learned of
Christian martyr mongering they also began to clean up the mess and dump
everything into the sea so that none of the Christians would go collect
bones & other artifacts from the dead as relics which they could
worship.

**4) Establishment of the Inquisitor’s office**

In 1639-40 a new office was established, whose sole duty was to remove
the Christian threat from Japan. The man in charge was Inoue
Chikugo-no-Kami Masashigean ex-Christian who became very famous for his
zeal in hunting down Christians and getting them to become apostates
through torture. For this purpose he seems to have refined the torture
and psy op techniques to keep the Christians alive as he preferred
apostates to dead Christians. He knew the Christian fetish for martyrdom
and he didn’t want to give them that satisfaction, and besides apostates
better than dead Christians demonstrated the impotence of Jesus to the
Christian sheep on the streets. He kept records of his days in the
office which as far as weknow haven’t yet been translated into English.
This office seems to have functioned as late as the year 1792.

**5) Domestic surveillance**

Initially apostate Christians were expected to prove their loyalty by
becoming a danka (parishioner) of a Buddhist temple and later this was
extended to the entire Japanese population in 1635 to catch crypto
Christians. The Buddhist priest would conduct an inspection and issue a
certificate that the person was not a Christian.

In addition to this the population was divided into groupings of five
families responsible for mutual surveillance regarding transgressions
against the law. This was known as the gonin-gumi system and was also
designed to catch hidden Christians.

Finally financial rewards were established for anyone in the public who
could inform the authorities about Christians:

> “The sending of Japanese ships to foreign countries is strictly
> forbidden.”
>
> “Japanese must not be sent to other countries. If any try to go
> secretly, they shall be punished by death.”
>
> “Rewards to those informing against Christians shall be as follows; –
> For religious teachers, three hundred or two hundred pieces of silver
> according to their rank. In other cases, as previously provided.”
>
> “Foreigners who progagate the religion of the Fathers, and likewise
> persons of evil reputation, shall as before be sent to prison in
> Omura.”
>
> “Descendants of the Portuguese must not be allowed to remain in the
> country. Any who retain them contrary to the law shall be put to
> death, and their relatives shall be punished according to the degree
> of the offense.”

**6) Isolation/Closed country**

In 1639 after crushing the massive Shimabara Christian uprising, the
third Shogun Iemitsu decided to close Japan to the West for good with
the exception of the Dutch who had assisted in crushing the rebellion by
providing cannon fire. They were allowed limited trade but with severe
restrictions. The Portuguese and Spaniards were expelled, ocean going
ships broken up, and strict border control established. Any Japanese who
tried to defy this and leave Japan was to be put to death as was any
Japanese returning from abroad. This was known as sakoku (closed
country) and would last until 1853 when Commodore Perry forced Japan to
open up at gunpoint.

Iemitsu was very serious about this as he demonstrated a few years later
when a Portuguese embassy arrived trying to revive the past trade. He
had the entire crew except those required to sail the ship back to Macau
beheaded & issued a warning saying that even if their Jesus himself
showed up defying him, he would meet the same fate.

**7) Information gathering**

We know that this was a basic policy scrupulously followed from various
sources. For a start when Christianity was still a significant threat we
know that Ieyasu got hold of the English sailor William Adams who
reached Japan and asked him in detail about conditions in Europe, the
difference between Protestantism (Adams’ religion) and Catholicism. He
honored Adams and made him into a Samurai (the first foreign Samurai)
and these interviews must have played a role in his conviction that
Christianity was a deadly threat when he finally decided to ban it. In
addition to this Japanese sources claim that Ieyasu sent a tea ceremony
master by the name of Nishi Soshin to Europe as a spy to learn all he
could about Christianity and report back to him (in reality he went to
spy in Spanish Manila, learnt Spanish & spied). It is said that Soshin
became an outward Christian, lived in therefor 3 years, came back to
Japan and reported everything he learnt such as the wars between
Catholics & Protestants, the fanaticism engendered by Christianity etc
(on a side note we know of no Hindu ruler who sent a spy to Europe to
gather intelligence on the enemy even as the Christians were rampaging
on our land during the Goan Inquisiton). We also know that future
European sailors that were ship wrecked long after Christianity was
wiped out were always thoroughly interrogated. The case of the
missionary Giovanni Sidotti is a case in point and is described as part
of the “border control” policy. Finally here is how Michael S. Laver
describes official policy in gathering information from the Dutch:

> Therefore, from the time Ieyasu definitively banned Christianity, the
> bugyo of Nagasaki played an important role in the attempt to
> extinguish the foreign religion in Japan – even though as noted
> earlier, there had already been an official since around 1640 whose
> primary responsibility was to stamp out the Catholic faith…
>
> The placards that were posted to inform the public of the shogun’s
> ordersand policies often carried the stipulation of a reward for
> those informing on Catholics. As late as the eighteenth century, these
> placards were still being erected regularly, even though serious
> instances of Christian apprehensions were extremely rare after the
> third quarter of the sixteenth century. **It is striking that
> historical memory was so pervasive among the ruling shogunal class of
> Japan. The Dutch noted that they were continually pressed to reveal
> details of Catholic activities in Asia and were continually exhorted
> to keep the shogun informed should they learn of any Catholic plots.**
> Long after a century had passed with no real instance of Christian
> subversion or any real Christian presence in public life, the
> shogunate was still concerned with the Christian “threat”…
>
> The Sakoku Edicts and the Politics of Tokugawa Hegemony by Michael S.
> Laver

**8) Public awareness**

Public awareness of the evils of Christianity was an important policy
which can be considered as a sort of vaccination/immunization program to
ward it off in the future. To our knowledge no other pagan civilization
took public awareness as seriously as the Japanese and this is one of
the factors which sets them apart. Awareness was achieved either through
popular anti Christian tracts such as Kirishitan Monogatari (Tales of
the Christians) & more importantly by public boards erected by the
government throughout all the areas where Christianity had spread. We
know that these boards were being erected into the 1860’s long after
Christianity had ceased to be a serious threat (indeed the first Western
missionaries allowed in after Japan was again forced open report seeing
these boards). The following provides a brief description:

> References to the hated religion were not permitted in books, and its
> very name might have been almost forgotten were it not written so
> prominently on the public proclamation-boards of every town. As soon
> as a child could read, he saw upon the boards that theKIRISHITAN
> JASHU-MON(Evil Sect of Christianity) was strictly prohibited, and
> when he asked what this meant, he was told by his parents about the
> wily scheme of the barbarian nations that sought to gain possession of
> Japan by means of a religion that was a strange compound of foolish
> doctrines and powerful magic.
>

**9) Border control**

The government was not content to just close Japan to Westerners on
paper but also made sure to implement strict border control by
establishing posts all along the coast as look outs for any strange
ships and this was kept up for a long time after the Christian threat
had receded into the background. We know this because of the famous case
of the Sicilian Jesuit Giovanni Sidotti
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Sidotti>) who in 1708
attempted to sneak into Japan. He was captured soon after he landed on
Yakushima Island, a small outlying island and not one of the four main
islands of Japan. Giovanni was taken to Nagasaki and imprisoned in the
Kirishitan Yashiki (Christian Mansion) specifically built to house
captured missionaries in 1646. He was then interrogated by Arai Hakuseki
a government official & Confucian thinker on a wide variety of issues
from geography to sciences to religion. Arai then wrote up his
observations in a report that would come of use later to others &
Giovanni died in the same mansion in 1714.

It must be kept in mind that the last public Christians had already died
out in the 1630’s and nearly 70 years had passed since then but the
Japanese never relaxed their vigilance and caught him as soon as he
landed on a minor outlying island and also gathered whatever useful
information they could. Part of the Japanese worry came from rumors that
the Jesuits were training the Japanese Christians descendants who were
deported to Macau to become missionaries and infiltrate back into Japan.

**10) Monitoring of apostates & their descendants**

This policy is described here:

> Because the Kirishitan faith was transmitted through family lines,
> there began during the Kan’ei era (1624-1643) an examination of
> Kirishitan families (ruizoku aratame). All relatives of the discovered
> Kirishitan were carefully monitored for the rest of their lives. After
> the examination was fully institutionalized in 1687, direct
> descendants of discovered Kirishitan were carefully supervised
> forseven generations for men and four generations for women. Records
> for this examination usually list more than twenty relatives for each
> Kirishitan examined. In case of Hyoemon in Katsuragi village, in the
> Bungo domain, for example, a total of thirty-three of his relatives
> were inspected, including his (deceased) parents, three sons, one
> daughter, nine grand children, and eighteen relatives.

**11) Book censorship**

Initially all Western books were prohibited but later on Dutch books
that strictly dealt with western science and medical matters were
allowed to be imported and translated to obtain useful knowledge. They
were subject to strict scrutiny to make sure that they contained no
references to Christianity.

All Japanese books aimed at promoting Christianity were also destroyed.

**12) Isolation & monitoring of the Dutch**

The Dutch being Protestants were seen as not being as terrible as the
Catholics but the Japanese knew they were still Christians at the end of
the day, so they were subject to very strict restrictions. For a start
they were confined to a tiny island called Deshima off Nagasaki where
only prostitutes were allowed to visit them. In addition to this, the
ships were always thoroughly searched for any Christian related stuff
and the Dutch were required to hand over their Bibles to the Japanese
upon landing. The Japanese were so incensed at anything related to
Christianity that the Dutch were forbidden to use the Christian calendar
in trade related contracts.

**13) Public testing**

The following description of a shipwrecked Russian captive in the Japan
of early 1800’s says it all about this policy:

> The Japanese are not followers of foreign religions.**They give,
> however, full liberty to a variety of sects, besides permitting the
> public profession of even the Kurile \[Ainu\] religion; but they are
> quiet intolerant to Christianity, on account of the troubles it has
> occasioned among them.**The Catholic priests, who formerly lived in
> Japan & enjoyed every possible freedom, preached the Christian faith,
> & converted a great number of the natives; but, at last, the progress
> of the new religion gave rise to a dreadful civil war.For this reason
> after the complete extirpation of the Christians, the following
> inscription was placed at the head of the stone tablets of laws, which
> are fixed up in all public places, & even in the streets:- “Whoever
> knows any individual who has taught Christianity, & can convict him
> thereof, shall receive a reward of 500 silver pieces.” – There is,
> likewise, a law which prohibits masters from hiring servants, until
> they receive from them a written assurance of their not being
> Christians. In Nangasaky, where Christianity had made the greatest
> progress, there is a staircase, on the steps of which are laid various
> ornaments & utensils of the Catholic church, & on the first step a
> crucifix. On new-year’s day, all the inhabitants of Nangasaky are
> obliged to ascend these steps; &, as a proof that they are not
> Christians, trample on the articles.The interpreter assured us, that
> many Christians who live at Nangasaky comply with this regulation from
> interested motives.
>
> – Narrative of my captivity in Japan during … 1811, 1812, and 1813 …:
> To which is added an account of voyages to the coasts of Japan and of
> negotiations … for the release of the author … by Captain Rikord,
> Volume 2 By Vasiliĭ Mikhaĭlovich Golovnin, Rikord (Captain), pg. 68

It is interesting to note that this public testing was being carried out
as late as 1813 even though Christianity had been crushed for the most
part by 1640.

**14) Intellectual critiques of Christianity**

The Japanese by and large focused less on the Christian doctrine and
more on the doctrines social effects such as destruction of shrines, and
shifting of the loyalty of the converts to Rome. The intellectuals by
and large seem to have seen Christian doctrine as too absurd to even
worth critiquing though there were a few exceptions such as Ha
Kirishitan (Against Christianity) by the Zen monk Suzuki Soshan which
demonstrated the hollowness of the doctrine. Another such critique was
published by the Japanese Jesuit apostate Fabian Fukan who had earlier
written a critique of Japanese religious practice from a Catholic
viewpoint. This can be read here:

> The Pro- and Anti-Christian Writings of Fukan Fabian (1565-1621)
>
> <http://japanese-religions.jp/publications/assets/JR33_a_Schrimpf.pdf>

By and large the attitude of Japanese intellectuals to Christianity can
be summed up by the following quote of Aizawa Seishisai in 1825 in his
very influential Shinron (New Theses) which was to play a role in the
establishment of state Shinto during the Meiji restoration to defend
Japan again from the renewed Christian threat:

> This, their \[the Western barbarians’\] so-called religious doctrine
> \[Christianity\], is both shallow and evil, and at its core not worthy
> of even discussing. However, its basis is simplistic, its vocabulary
> is vulgar, and that is why it easily beguiles the masses. With pretty
> words it pretends to respect Heaven by forcing \[meaning on\] Heaven.
> It pretends to represent human ethical enlightenment by forsaking the
> Way of humanity.

**15) Construction of Christian prison**

The authorities built a special prison called Kirishitan Yashiki where
important captured missionaries and converts were kept and tortured. The
Japanese seem to have been concerned about the evil of Christianity
spreading to the general prison populace, so they constructed this
special prison to interrogate Christians. The captured missionary
Giovanni Sidotti was also housed in this building until he died.
