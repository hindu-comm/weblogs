Narendra Modi & Shinzo Abe: What explains the Western loathing?

**Prelude**

The above quotes encapsulate the modal attitudes of the West towards
those considered heathens. Much the same attitude prevails today in
sections of the Western elite whether in the frank Christian form or its
various secular manifestations.

With that in mind, it is not surprising to discerning Hindus to see a
slew of articles in the Western media bashing both Shinzo Abe & Narendra
Modi. The Anglosphere would have us believe that they are concerned
about “human rights” even as they support various Sunni ghazis to
overthrow secular Arab regimes. We on the other hand hold that it is
merely a cover for the fear & loathing they have for any openly “pagan”
civilization.

**Shinzo Abe**

![Abe with his wife paying their respect to Yoshida Shoin, a nationalist
thinker who contributed greatly to the Meiji

Abe is a man with a mission & that mission is nothing less than the
decolonization of Japan. This includes a revision of the American
imposed constitution including its secularism to bring it in line with
the values of Japanese civilization
(<https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/148/>).

He is the chairman of Japan’s Rebirth (*Sosei Nippon*) an organization
that seeks to reawaken Japanese pride in their history and culture with
an emphasis on the Imperial Family and Shinto. He is also the chairman
of the Shinto Political Alliance Diet Member’s Roundtable (*Shinto seiji
renmei kokkai giin kondankai*), the Diet arm of the Shinto Political
Alliance (*Shinto seiji renmei, or Shinseiren*). Thus in the eyes of the
West he is already a “bad” man because they cannot ever tolerate an
openly heathen leader.

Standing up to Chinese imperialism is bad enough but it gets “dangerous”
when Abe starts talking about restoring Japanese values. In the past
decade, under previous LDP administrations some of the most egregious
American impositions have already been overturned such as the ban on
shrine visits for school children. Now with Abe in charge things might
go further in this direction and we might see the reemergence of Shinto
taking its natural place in Japanese politics.

The West likes its leaders compliant and working within the boundaries
predetermined by them & Abe does not fit the mold. Hence the recent slew
of anti-Abe propaganda pieces in the Western media which can be seen
here:

**Narendra Modi**

![Modi paying his respect to Chhatrapati

The rise of Modi seems to have taken the West by surprise as they never
expected him to get so far after demonizing him for years in their media
as some sort of Hitler and a Hindu nationalist (as if that is somehow
bad). They have tried all their usual tricks such as unleashing their
Christian attack dogs (note the recent letter of the Xavier’s College
Principal Father Mascarenhas to the students criticizing Modi or John
Dayal’s trip to the US to testify against India) and even propping up
the fellowship of the broom (hat tip for the expression:
<http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/6384/>) led by Kejriwal
. In their own land we have seen their efforts to deny entry to Modi
through lobbying by evangelicals and Muslims (once again showing the
fundamental alignment of Muslims & Christians when it comes to
heathens).

But in spite of all this Modi has defied their expectations and seems to
have captured the pulse of the nation cutting across regional and caste
lines. He has also shown himself to be an able administrator who can
bring development to his people. We have good data showing that
Christian proselytizers thrive in the absence of governance, so what can
be worse for them than a PM who will actually do his job. A
strengthening of the economy will also go along with a strengthening of
the Indian military with a man perceived as a Hindu nationalist at the
helm.

Having one openly heathen leader in Abe is bad enough but to have Modi
in addition to him is a bad dream for the usual suspects. Thus the West
has real reasons to be worried and they have indeed responded with a
slew of negative media articles about Modi which can be viewed here:

**Narendra-Abe**

In 2007 after the conclusion of Vibrant Gujarat summit, Modi personally
went to Japan to woo investors. He was the first Chief Minister to do so
and while there he met and spent time with Abe. Later that year Abe
himself visited India but could not visit Gujarat due to protocol, so
Modi personally went all the way to Delhi and spent time with Abe.

It was during the same visit that Abe personally met and talked with the
son of Radhabinod Pal, the Indian judge who stood up for the truth at
the Tokyo show trials. He is widely admired even today by Japanese
nationalists and has a monument dedicated to him at the Yasukuni shrine.
He cast the only dissenting vote against punishing Japanese officials
for war crimes, which included Abe’s grandfather Kishi. Perhaps this was
one more reason for Abe’s pro-Indian stance because as early as 2007 he
declared that *“a strong India is in the best interest of Japan and a
strong Japan is in the best interest of India.”* In his 2007 book
Towards a Beautiful Country: My Vision For Japan, Abe had also written
that it would *“not be a surprise if in another decade, Japan-India
relations overtake Japan-U.S. and Japan-China ties.”*

More recently when Abe won the elections in Japan, Modi sent him a
congratulatory message even though he was still just a Chief Minister at
that time. So considering their past history, we can expect the
relations between India and Japan to become even stronger. This combined
with what is seen as their “heathen” credentials truly fills the usual
suspects with dread. To quote one of their Japanologist (quiet like the
Indologist subversionists) attack dogs:

> Mullins says this magnetic tug of the past is not unique to Japan. “I
> see Shinto fundamentalists as very similar to U.S. Christian
> fundamentalists and Hindu neo-nationalists,”
>
> <http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/11/23/national/back-to-the-future-shintos-growing-influence-in-politics/#.U1qZhfldX7P>

If you set aside the obfuscation about Christian fundamentalists, it
becomes obvious that the real target is the heathens and their leaders.

**Conclusion**

Just as in the past, the Abrahamics cannot stand to see rival pagan
powers left standing and it is all the more dreadful to them if these
powers start collaborating with each other. So we can expect them to do
all they can to thwart the India-Japan relationship, and any nationalist
policies that can challenge the Christian Anglo-Saxon (note that David
Cameron has recently reiterated that the UK is a Christian country)
hegemony. May the Gods foil their designs and grant success to both Modi
& Abe in their endeavors.
