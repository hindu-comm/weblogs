Christian Missionaries: The Vanguard of Western Imperialism-I

Separated by time and space the words of the two heathens should give
one pause for thought for they seem to be saying the same in regards to
missionaries acting as the vanguard for European imperialism. This is an
image at odds with the one cultivated by the Indian movie industry which
involvesloving padre’s and missionaries like the late Theresa who were
supposedly serving us while the “evil” Hindu pujari’s are merely
salivating over their expected offerings. The astute of course know that
the record of Christian missionaries in general has been one of
destruction, genocide, and acting as the vanguardof Western
imperialism. In this article we focus on some examples of missionaries
acting as spies, subversives, and destroyers of native culture all over
the world. We will focus on examples from around the world, not so much
on India specifically (though we will briefly touch on India in part II)
because we wish to demonstrate that this is a global phenomenon hardly
unique to India and part of a time-tested Western strategy for conquest.

**“Let us invade Japan for Christ”**

In 1587 Hideyoshi after taking control of most of Japan passed the first
anti-Christian edicts banishing missionaries. Hideyoshi’s reasons
included destruction of Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, selling
Japanese into slavery, and forcible conversions of the populace by
Christian daimyo (warlords).

The Jesuit response was led by one Gaspar Coelho, the Vice-Provincial of
the Jesuits in Japan and is summarized by the following quote:

> Daft Coelho in the meantime brewed the plan to take up arms, stand a
> siege in Nagasaki, and wait for aid from abroad. 52
>
> 52\. See Boxer, Christian Century, p. 149:Coelho “endeavored to get
> Arima to induce the other Christian daimyo to unite in armed
> resistance against the expulsion edict.In this he failed, so he fell
> back on a more temporizing policy. **But he still had not learned his
> lesson entirely, sincehe wrote to Manila, Macao, and Goa begging for
> two or three hundred soldiers and firearms wherewith to stiffen the
> Christian daimyo.**The Spanish authorities contented themselves with
> referring his request to Madrid, and the Jesuit Superior at Manila
> sent him a severe reprimand for his imprudence.**The Portuguese sent
> him some weapons but no troops.”**

Note the fact that even after 400+ years the Jesuits were hiding records
of these events at the time this book was published in the 1970’s.
Indeed considering that the Vatican is the longest operating and largest
crime syndicate in history, this is not very surprising. We hold that
the secret archives of the Vatican if they are ever cracked open will
reveal far more shocking details than Wikileaks.

To get back to the issue at hand, this was hardly the first time that
Coelho had proposed such schemes. In 1584 & 1585 he addressed the
following pleas:

> That the Jesuits had their military adventurist faction is all too
> well established.Gaspar Coelho was one of its members. In 1584 he had
> addressed to the Spaniards in the Philippines a plea for the dispatch
> of “four ships laden with men, artillery, and food . . . to succor the
> Christians of Japan that are pressed by the heathen,”

To his credit Alessandro Valignano his higher up in Japan condemned his
actions and secretely disposed off the arms the Portuguese sent. But his
condemnation seemed more motivated by the reprisals it would bring on
the Christians if Hideyoshi found out and less by any moral objections.
It must be remembered that Pope Alexander VI himself divided the newly
discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal with the
Treaty of Tordesillas on 7^(th) June, 1494 CE.

Finally it must be mentioned that in 1614 the Spanish seemed to have
planned another invasion of Japan from Spanish Manila to save the
Japanese Christians, though this never seem to have got off the ground
and we can’t find much details about this proposal.

As a side note, it might interest Hindus know that according to Ishwar
Sharan, this same Gaspar Coelho was also involved in perpetrating the
“St.” Thomas fraud in India

**“Let us colonize Ming China for Jesus”**

While Padre Coelho was proposing his hare-brained schemes to invade
Japan, the Spanish who had meanwhile colonized parts of what is now
Philippines began to put forward a scheme to invade and colonize the
weakened Ming empire. The scheme itself was idiotic and had little
chance of success but more interesting are the reasons given. The
following quotes summarize the issue:

> At precisely the time of Coelho’s arrival in Sakai (April 1586) Padre
> Alonso Sanchez SJ was in Manila submitting his project for the
> conquest of China, of which C. R. Boxer has to say: “The report has to
> be read to be believed.”10 The Padre, “a person of very holy life,
> much learning, prudence, and excellent judgement” (as he was touted to
> Philip II) envisioned that the modest objective would be obtained
> easily enough, with a motley force of Spaniards, Filipinos, and
> Japanese auxiliaries conducted by**“the fathers of the Society of
> Jesus, who are to act as guides.”**It would be interesting to know
> whether Coelho was aware of the project (or, better yet, Hideyoshi).
>
> – Deus Destroyed The Image of Christianity in Early Modern Japan by

> But the cause of conquest was far from lost. **The change back to a
> military stance was largely inspired by a strong and determined
> Jesuit, Alonso Sánchez, who set off for what he called the “kingdoms
> of China” in March 1582. When he returned to Manila he reported that
> it was impossible to preach the gospel in China without military
> backing. He talked constantly of the startling benefits which the
> enactment of the “China project” would yield Spain**. But he thought

While this was ongoing, the Coelho fellow seems to have been brighter
than the Spanish in Manila and proposed the following plan:

> In 1585, Gaspar Coelho had already requested a Spanish fleet to
> ‘evangelize’ East Asia. **He argued that when the 66 states of Japan
> had been converted to Christianity, “King Philip could use the sharp
> and aggressive Japanese army to easily conquer China.”** This Jesuit
> missionary estimated China could be easily conquered for four reasons.
> “First, the people are idle and effeminate, especially the
> aristocracy. Second, there is not a single musket in the whole
> country. Third, the government has forbidden the people from arming
> themselves out of a fear of revolts. Fourth, the conditions are ripe
> for revolts due to harsh rule.

It must be emphasized that the Japanese armies’ of this time were some
of the best in the world thanks to nearly 100 years of civil war which
made the Samurai a disciplined and lethal fighting force on land. The
Japanese had mastered the mass production of arquebus’ introduced by the
Portuguese and even made some improvements allowing them to fire in rain
& implementing standardization. They also figured out the technique of
volley fire, first implemented on a large scale by Oda Nobunaga at the
Battle of Nagashino (depicted here:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIs3ibPgosE)>. All these factors came
into play in the performance of the Japanese army during the two massive
invasions of Hideyoshi into Korea (known as the Imjin War), a prelude to
his ambition to conquer Beijing. More often than not, the Japanese
simply overwhelmed the combined forces of the Chinese & Koreans with
their superior firepower and discipline on land. The weakest points of
the invasion force were inferior cannon and ships which combined with
the brilliance of Korean Admiral Yi Sun ultimately doomed Hideyoshi’s
plans. Why do we narrate all this you ask?

Consider Coelho’s scheme & imagine that Japan had indeed been converted,
and then imagine the massive Christian army from Japan augmented by
Spanish-Portuguese naval power & cannon. Then it is not unlikely that
the Spanish mleccha’s would have had some success regarding their China
scheme, a nightmare for all heathens.

Fast-forwarding a few centuries, in 1825 the brilliant Japanese heathen
political thinker Aizawa Seishisai penned his magnum opus Shinron (New
Theses). Shinronwas to have an explosive impact on the men behind Meiji
restoration and beyond. Therein he claimed:

> Russia and Britain then would subvert Japan proper by Christianizing
> its “stupid commoners,” and would beguile a new generation of
> “Japanese raiders” (wako) into attacking and weakening China. With the
> Ch’ing thus crippled, Russia, could deliver the coup de grace from the
> north.

> Theses of 1825 by Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, p. 112

Thus he anticipated the time-tested strategy of the Leukosphere in using
the converted rabble of ex-heathen nations as cannon fodder to advance
the cause of Jesus and their imperial interests into new territories.
Douglas MacArthur and the American mlecchas would later try to repeat
this project in trying to Christianize post-war Japan (failed), South
Korea (success), and Vietnam (remember the self-immolation Bauddha monk
Thich Quang Duc <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYsXH00kcaw>&
persecution of the majority Bauddhas by the US backed Catholic Diem
regime? Also see:
<http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/6384/>). One can
substitute Spain for Russia and Ming for Ch’ing in Aizawa’s words and it
would be a recapitulation of Coelho’s plan centuries earlier. We doubt
Aizawa had any inkling about Coelho’s plans and he seems to have come
upon this idea independently thanks to his own brilliance and intuition
about the evils of the Jesus cult and its primary custodians.

Finally, it may well be likely that Lafcadio Hearn writing some 80 years
later after Aizawain the Meiji era had these Jesuit conspiracies in
mind, when he commented thus on the failure of the effort to
ChristianizeJapan:

> Yet this religion, for which thousands vainly died, had brought to
> Japan nothing but evil disorders, persecutions, revolts, political
> troubles, and war. Even those virtues of the people which had been
> evolved at unutterable cost for the protection and conservation of
> society, – their self-denial, their faith, their loyalty, their
> constancy and courage, – were by this black creed distorted, diverted,
> and transformed into forces directed to the destruction of that
> society. Could that destruction have been accomplished, and a new
> Roman Catholic empire have been founded upon the ruins, the forces of
> that empire would have been used for the further extension of priestly
> tyranny, the spread of the Inquisition, the perpetual Jesuit warfare
> against freedom of conscience and human progress. Well may we pity the
> victims of this pitiless faith, and justly admire their useless
> courage: yet who can regret that their cause was lost? … Viewed from
> another standpoint than that of religious bias, and simply judged by
> its results, the Jesuit effort to Christianize Japan must be regarded
> as a crime against humanity, a labour of devastation, a calamity
> comparable only, – by reason of the misery and destruction which it
> wrought, – to an earthquake, a tidal-wave, a volcanic eruption.

We could not agree more.

In part II, we hope to explore Jesuit industrial espionage in India &
Qing Empire, their spying for the Russian empire against the Qing empire
(they saw the Russians as fellow Christians as against the heathen
Manchu & Han) their role in the colonization of what is now Zimbabwe,
the genocide of natives in Guam, and more.
