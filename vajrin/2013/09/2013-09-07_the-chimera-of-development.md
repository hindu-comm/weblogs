The chimera of development & the Essence of our Nation

The above words of the Japanese patriot & scholar Aizawa Seishisai were
spoken in the context of an isolated Japan menaced by the West &
Christianity (considered the greatest threat to Japan by Aizawa). But as
a heathen, these words speak to me in a way the buzzwords of “growth”,
“development”, and “progress” bandied about by the rootless Hindu elite
never can. Aizawa is succinct and straight to the point, to confront and
defeat monotheist barbarism it is no use to be rich if the nation is
rootless. We have before us the spectacular fall of South Korea which
for all its technological and economic progress has seen 30% of its
population embrace the barbaric Jesus cult with the toxic effects
visible in everyday life. For a small sample of what’s happening see:

After offering this critique of the “development” thinkers of his day,
Aizawa put forth his solution of unifying Shinto with government in
order to bring the people together to face the enemy. Henceforth the
government & the Emperor should resume their previous function of
sponsoring and performing various religious rituals of national
significance:

> By worshiping Amaterasu \[privately\] within court enclosures, earlier
> emperors had offered the full measure of their sincere devotion to
> Her, it is true. But the significance of \[earlier\] emperors’ ritual
> acts was lost on the people below. By worshipping Amaterasu publicly,
> Emperor Sujin displayed his sincere devotion to the whole realm. Thus,
> the people grasped the significance of His Majesty’s act \[directly
> and sensually\], not through explanations or lectures…
>
> The ancients \[i.e., Mencius\] said, “Filial devotion by the realm en
> masse is the ultimate in filial devotion.” When the Duke of Chou was
> praised in antiquity for having attained the “ultimate in filial
> devotion,” it was because everyone in the realm \[joined him\] in
> worshiping his ancestors, each person according to his proper
> status.The Duke of Chou did not worship his parents within ritual-hall
> confines, but in public, together with his people.No doubt he had the
> same idea as Emperor Sujin.

Aizawa’s thought was carried forward by the leaders of the Meiji
restoration and resulted in the establishment of state Shinto that was
to play a critical role in the modernization of Japan & help defend it
against Christianity. But those Hindus who write admiringly of Japan
never deign to notice these factors (see:
<http://centreright.in/2013/03/lessons-for-nehru-from-19th-century-japan/>)&
instead focus on the myth of some free market utopia which never
existed. Contrary to Milton Friedman’s claims bandied about these
half-read Hindus, no Meiji leader of significance believed in the
chimera of unrestricted free market and trade. Indeed even today the
Japanese do not believe in unrestricted free trade and their trade
policy is much more influenced by the German school of Friedrich List
(see:
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1993/12/how-the-world-works/305854/>)with
its emphasis on nationalism.

In more modern times we have seen that economic power is not everything
with the dramatic fall of South Korea which is now 30% Christian. One
may contrast this with the spectacular failure of missionaries in
poverty stricken and nuclear devastated American occupied Japan in the
immediate aftermath of WW2 despite considerable efforts on the part of
McArthur to Christianize Japan (see:
<http://www.amerika.org/globalism/religion-and-the-case-of-capitalism-richard-l-rubenstein/>).
The reasons for these different trajectories of South Korea and Japan
lie in the fact that the Japanese had long been inculcated with a clear
understanding of national essence & love for their own religion of
Shinto by the government so that few were attracted by the monotheist
fanaticism of Christianity even in desperate poverty. To take another
example involving military matters, the China of Maoist days had
achieved a stalemate against the massive economic and military might of
the USA in North Korea, and shamefully for us had managed to thrash our
forces rather easily in 1962 even though at that point in time India had
a higher GDP per capita. A key reason for this was that where as the
Chinese were guided by hardnosed Legalism of the Shang Yang variety, our
chAchA had chucked out Chanakya and replaced him with five year plans,
panchasheel, non-alignment, democracy, secularism etc. As a result the
military was neglected and underfunded, and more importantly it was
rudderless with no guiding ideology except Nehru’s fancy slogans.
Therefore mere economic development is useless for Hindus unless
economic or military might is backed up with a clear understanding of
our national essence.

But enough with the economic policies, to come back to the main
question, we need to look into the “essence” of our own nation which is
currently claimed to be weak propositions such as secularism, democracy,
socialism, or the free market as in the case of neoliberals who populate
the “Hindu” right.

Under these weak milquetoast ideologies, the nation is a rudderless ship
as daily events are demonstrating. This is because we have replaced a
civilization/nation bound by Dharma and its accompanying rituals with a
proposition nation which says that anyone is welcome in India so long as
he/she claims to subscribe to these mleccha slogans. It is entirely fine
for the people who subscribe to a proposition nation if the Hindus were
to disappear into the sands of time if this happened through some
peaceful means such as voluntary conversions, mass immigration etc. To
quote the astute Frank Salter:

> **Constitutional patriotism is usually linked to the more destructive
> doctrine of multiculturalism, which encourages minority identity and
> mobilization while punishing those of majorities.A concept nation is
> incapable of principled defence against ethnic replacement. The
> doctrine is as pathological as a conception of the family that did not

So unless Hindus can define their own national essence in a proper
manner we will be joining the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and other
heathens in the museum. Some may object and claim that “Hindutva” is
this essence but we must point out that this had been rendered
meaningless because everything under the sun is now placed under
Hindutva even if it explicitly goes against the basics of what Savarkar
had said. For example Savarkar was clear that Hindus were a nation by
themselves & that the Islamo-Xtian combine were not part of this nation.
But today the supposedly Hindu nationalist BJP propagates myths such as
“Mohammadi Hindu” or “Isai Hindu” which only earn them contempt from
Muslims & Christians.

Therefore the need of the hour for Hindus is to properly define the
essence of their own nation, and chuck the mleccha buzzwords such as
democracy, secularism, free market etc., into the garbage bin where they
belong.
