Japan’s defeat of Christianity & Lessons for Hindus

> Although far from uniform, the composite picture of Christianity that
> emerges in a number of Japanese sources from the sixteenth to the
> nineteenth centuries is of a Buddhist heresy propagated by barbarians
> and focused around the worship of a demonic deity.28 This sect
> encourages loyalty to a barbarian king said to be the representative
> of this monstrous god on earth. It expands its empire by subverting
> the inhabitants of a region through a combination of bribery and
> deception or black magic. It takes advantage of and encourages civil
> wars. Peasants, the poor, and the uneducated are particularly
> susceptible to its teachings. Eventually-as was believed to have
> happened in the Philippines and Java-the barbarians, aided by local
> traitors, annex portions of a country, corrupting the local rulers and
> enslaving the populace. The Christian followers then destroy the
> images and temples of the true gods and buddhas while purging local
> customs. This leads to the destabilization of the existing social
> order and the emplacement of a new order modeled on Christian
> civilization.

The above is a gist of the Japanese analysis of Christianity having felt
its presence deeply in their country.

The following should give a sample of what Christians were doing in
Japan (as they always do among heathens):

> As Omura Sumitada had gone off to the wars, it so happened that he
> passed on the way an idol, Marishiten by name, which is their god of
> battles. When they pass it, they bow and pay reverence to it, and the
> pagans who are on horseback dismount as a sign of their respect. Now
> the idol had above it a cockerel. As the daimyo came there with his
> squadron he had his men stop and ordered them to take the idol and
> burn it together with the whole temple; and he took the cockerel and
> gave it a blow with the sword, saying to it, “Oh, how many times have
> you betrayed me!”**And after everything had been burnt down, he had a
> very beautiful cross erected on the same spot,**and after he and his
> men had paid very deep reverence to it, they continued on their way to
> the wars.

> – Luís Fróis (1532 – July 8, 1597), a Portuguese Christian missionary
> giving an eyewitness description of non Christian shrines being

Very few people are aware of this story & think Japan was isolated till
Commodore Perry threatened it with guns. In fact it was eager for trade
with Europe in the 16th and early 17th centuries before the poison of
Christianity seeped into their society and began destroying it.
Fortunately the Japanese unlike the Hindus were endowed with rulers who
possessed great foresight who decided to extirpate Christianity by any
means necessary to save Japan & that included closing off Japan to the
West for the next 250 years.

The following is taken from a book describing this story & is given here
for what it’s worth with the hope that our foolish Hindu compatriots may
learn something about the nature of the Abrahamic beast & the means
required to slay it. We would also like to express our admiration for
the Japanese people for they are the only heathen people in history
known to have almost entirely extirpated an Abrahamic cult from their
lands after it made deep inroads.

People interested in this aspect of history may explore the following
Wikipedia links as a starting point:

One may also explore the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of the greatest
heathen heroes in history though little known outside Japan. He perhaps
singlehandedly saved Nippon from following the same fate as ancient
Greece, Rome, or the much battered Hindu civilization at the hands of
the Abrahamics with no end in sight except what befell Greece and Rome.

The missionaries tried again of course to spread their poison in the
Meiji era but after tasting the poison once, it seems the Japanese had
acquired enough immunity to resist it. In contemporary Japan,
Christianity is still associated with intolerance, fanaticism, and
considered a morbid death cult. To quote a book about post WWII Japan:

> Christianity’s intolerance of other faiths then as now, has also
> disturbed the Japanese who still have in their homes two altars, the
> Buddhist buttsudan and the Shinto saidan, which are most often
> tactfully set facing in different directions.
>
> The central idea of a suffering Christ, a God who allowed himself to
> be publicly disgraced, then miraculously rose into heaven is
> inconceivable to them. I once asked a friend of mine, a Japanese
> Catholic with degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown, why the Church
> had never succeeded in Japan. “Christ hanging on the cross bothers
> us,” he said, “he looks too much like a loser for a God. It was so
> embarrassing for Him to do that. It is embarrassing even to try
> explaining it. Maybe our blood is just too thin in Japan. We don’t
> feel comfortable with a God who sheds blood like that.”
