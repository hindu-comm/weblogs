Battle hymn from r.g veda – apratiratha aindra sUkta

As’valAyana gr.hya sUtra (3-12) gives the rituals to be performed by the
royal purohita before a battle. The hymn of pAyu bhAradvAja (RV 6-75) is
prescribed in this ritual along with those of apratiratha aindra (RV
10-103), s’Asa bhAradvAja (10-152) and the second sauparn.a sUkta (pra
dhArA yantu – RV khila 1-3). aitareya brAhman.a (8-10) mentions the
uttering of the same three suktas in order to conquer enemies.

br.haddevatA (8.13) states that the sUkta of apratiratha aindra was sung
by seer of the same name in order to gain victory in battle. We shall
look at the apratiratha aindra sUkta in this post.

RV (10-103)

1.  indra, fast moving, who is like a bull sharpening his horns,
    terrifying, exciter of men, roaring, with ever vigilant eyes (lit.
    eyes that never close), the only hero (ekavIra), defeated a hundred
    armies (s’atam senA ajayat).
2.  with the roaring indra, who has eyes that never close, victorious,
    makes war, unconquerable, violent, showerer of arrows which he holds
    in his hand as the ally, O you (refers to the soldiers), conquer the
    enemies in battle.
3.  indra, the warrior who faces several enemies and subdues them, with
    marut gan.a-s holding arrows in their hands as his company,
    victorious in battle, drinker of Soma, strong armed, with a
    ferocious bow, shoots arrows aimed true.
4.  br.haspati, killer of rAks.asa-s, tormentor of enemies (who are
    driven away by him), who breaks armies to smithereens, destroyer,
    ever victorious in battle, come with your chariot and protect our
    chariots.
5.  well known for strength, powerful, foremost of heroes, victorious,
    manly, fierce conqueror, attended by heroes (“..vIryavanto
    (a)nucarA..” says sAyan.a) and mighty warriors, son of strength,
    possessor of water, O indra, ascend your victorious chariot..
6.  destroyer of clouds/mountains, possessor of water, wielder of vajra,
    Indra destroys his enemies with great strength. Follow him, O
    warrior kinsmen. Like indra, my friends, show great zeal and power.
7.  may indra, who bursts through the clouds opening them with great
    strength, pitiless, hero, with great anger (hundred-fold anger –
    “s’atamanyu”), unconquerable, destroyer of armies, invincible,
    protect our armies.
8.  May indra lead this army. May br.haspati, daks.in.A, yajn\~a and
    soma go in front. May the marut-s be the vanguard of this devasenA,
    which is ever victorious and a destroyer of enemies.
9.  May the strength of indra, king varun.a, Aditya-s and the fierce
    hosts of marut-s be ours. The roar of the ever victorious,
    magnanimous deva-s has arisen and caused the world to tremble.
10. O indra, energize my weapons, galvanize the spirit of my warriors,
    increase the strength of my horses and the noise raised by the
    conquering chariots.
11. When our banners come together, o indra, make our arrows be
    victorious. May our warriors be superior in battle (be victorious);
    O gods, protect us when the call for battle is given.
12. O apvA/apivA (a goddess), bewilder the minds of our enemies, seize
    their limbs and depart. Go near them and burn their hearts with
    sorrow. May they be kept in great darkness.
13. O men, advance and conquer. May indra grant you happiness. May your
    arms be so strong that you remain invincible.
14. O marut-s, let this army of our enemy which is proceeding towards us
    clamoring for fight be covered in darkness by you such that they
    could not even identify each other.
15. O enemies, may you become blind and friendless like the headless ahi
    (a serpent snake killed by indra). Let the chief among you, who are
    being burnt, be killed by indra.

The last two r.ca-s are not found in the popular RV samhita text. They
are taken from the As’valAyana samhita. But the r.ca-s appear to be old
and do not seem to be interpolations of much later period. Thus, we have
included them here. B.B.Chaubey has done a great work by bringing out
the text of As’valayana samhita with translation of the additional
mantras found in the samhita (which are not found in the popular s’Akala
samhita). We wish that vaidika scholars indulge in such important
projects to save the texts from extinction as well as to protect them
from anti-hindu white indologists, who will otherwise remain unopposed.
