Shinto in politics & its significance for Hindus

Recently we came across this article which talks about the growing
assertiveness of Shintoists in Japanese politics which is quiet
significant for Hindus though our people don’t realize it and we hope to
rectify that here. We recommend first going through the above Japan
Times article before reading this.

**Roots of State Shinto**

The roots of what is called “state Shinto” go back to the Meiji era
(1868-1912) when Japan was forced to open up to trade by Commodore
Perry’s gunboat diplomacy. But even before this era, Japanese
intellectuals had kept track of events abroad and were very worried
about the ever encroaching Western imperialism which finally reached
their doors with Perry. One of these intellectuals was the scholar
Aizawa Seishisai who was aware of Japan’s horrible experience with
Christianity in the 16^(th) and 17^(th) centuries
(<https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/japans-defeat-of-christianity-lessons-for-hindus/>)and
the continued use of Christianity for subversion/colonization by the
mleccha powers. In 1825 he penned Shinron (New Theses) where he pointed
this out and said that the threat to Japan from the West was not
primarily military but the far more insidious poison of Christianity
which could be used by the Western powers to seduce the commoners and
bring down Japan. He pointed out:

> Whenever they seek to take over a country, they employ the same
> method. By trading with that nation, they learn about its geography
> and defenses. **If these are weak, they dispatch troops to invade the
> nation; if strong, they propagate Christianity to subvert it from
> within.** Once our people’s hearts and minds are captivated by
> Christianity, they will greet the barbarian host with open arms, and
> we would be powerless to stop them…
>
> The barbarians are triumphant everywhere and have begun to disseminate
> their poisonous doctrines in our Divine Realm. . . . Yet we in the
> Middle Kingdom remain without an unswerving moral basis of action; our
> people lack unity and spiritual cohesion, our leaders can dream up
> nothing better than stop-gap, gloss-it-over measures to tide them over
> each day’s crises. **Our Land of Illustrious Gods has fallen to such
> depths that we now sit by idly and allow these foreign beasts to lure
> the common people away from us. Have we lost all sense of shame?**

Aizawa’s solution to this problem was the unification of Shinto with the
government which he claimed was the norm in Japan’s past but had been
subverted by creeds like Buddhism and a long period of historical
decline. Henceforth the Emperor would take his rightful place and resume
the performance of rituals of national significance for the spiritual
succor of the people. By implementing this Japan would see off the
threat from Christianity and avoid national destruction.

Later during the Meiji era when the new leaders looked for a unifying
ideology they found Shinto & the Emperor to be the two most essential
ingredients in holding the country together. For this reason state
Shinto was established as advocated by Aizawa with everyone being
required to participate in certain ceremonies and rituals of Shinto
origin as their civic duty. The Christian missionaries and their
Japanese converts of course did not like it but could not do anything as
Japan was not colonized.

The Meiji restoration was an astonishing success as Japan went from an
isolated backwater to a world power in just 37 years by defeating the
Russian empire in 1905.

But 40 years later Japan suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the
combined might of the mleccha’s though not before dealing a death blow
to the mleccha colonial enterprise in Asia
(<http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/the-moment-of-silence/>).

**McArthur’s Christian Project**

With Japan’s total defeat, the Christian vultures began their third
major attempt at Christianizing the country (the first in the 16^(th)
century & the second during the Meiji era having failed) and for this
purpose the alien ideology of secularism was imposed. State Shinto was
dismantled and the government was required to show no preference or
support for Shinto.

Parallel to this ran McArthur’s project of Christianizing Japan by
flooding the country with Bibles and missionaries. McArthur considered
Christianity and democracy to be his two greatest “gifts” to Japan and
issued a statement expressing his happiness about the Japanese Christian
Tetsu Katayama being elected Prime Minister. He claimed that it was a
momentous event in history when 3 great nations of Asia had Christians
leading them referring to China’s Chiang Kai-shek (a Methodist) & the
Philippines.

Unfortunately for the mlecchas their Christianization project failed to
take off because the old Shinto spirit was still alive in the defeated
Japanese and blocked these missionary efforts. By contrast, similar
tactics of McArthur achieved great success in nearby South Korea which
is now 30% Christian.

**Effects of secularism**

The overall project may have failed but American imposed secularism has
done considerable damage to Japan and continues to do so. After the war,
many routine rituals of everyday community life were declared to be
“religious” and thus supposedly against the secular ethos of the
constitution. For example the jichinsai ritual is a groundbreaking
ceremony paralleled by our own vastu puja. It is performed whenever a
new building or other construction opens for use. For an example see:

Under the current constitution imposed by the mleccha’s such rituals are
not to be performed in any government buildings or government sponsored
projects (not always adhered to). There are many more similar examples
and they are paralleled in our own land where in the name of secularism
the Saraswati Vandana is prohibited in government schools among other
things. Hence, we say that secularism a Trojan horse for the Abrahamics
to weaken and destroy pagan societies.

With all this going on, Japanese patriots had to shut up as they
suffered total defeat. Any patriot who spoke of reverence for the
Emperor or the importance of Shinto rituals for the nation was declared
to be a “fascist”, & “militarist” by the Japanese leftists, Christians,
and their mleccha backers.

So they wisely backed off and seem to have been waiting for the right
time for Japan to reassert itself and that time seems to have arrived.

**Shinto is back in politics?**

As the article points out there has been a growing influence of Shinto
in Japanese politics. Koizumi had attended the Yasukuni shrine
frequently to pay respect to the war dead, & Taro Aso has visited
various shrines including the Ise shrine to pray when he was the PM.

Recently the current PM Shinzo Abe attended the shikinen sengu ceremony
which is the 20 year rebuilding ritual of the Ise jingu (considered the
most important Shinto shrine & dedicated to the sun Goddess Amaterasu)
along with his wife and other party members. This seems to have created
a flutter among the Japanese Christians & the mlecchas as the following
shows:

> Muneo Bannai, 79, who heads a committee within the National Christian
> Council in Japan that studies issues related to Yasukuni Shrine, said:
> “It is an act that violates the principle of separation of religion
> and politics that is defined in the Constitution. We are taking this
> matter very seriously.”
>

Japanese politicians’ personally visiting a shrine is controversial
according to this Christianbuffoon & his fellow travelers. Abe & other
politicians visit to the Ise rebuilding ritual can be viewed here:

The significance of the ritual is described in this video:

But it is perfectly ok for countries like UK to have an established
church & for its PM Cameron to declare that the UK is a Christian
country (<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16224394>) despite the
horrible history of Christian British imperialism that led to death of
millions of Hindus & other heathens
(<http://jambudveep.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/an-explanatory-note-on-the-famines-in-india/>)
. It is also apparently okay for the German government to finance
churches directly
(<http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21588129-episcopal-extravagance-fuels-criticism-state-financed-churches-bishop-bling>).
Finally we have the US that bastion of secularism which found nothing
wrong in exterminating its Native American population & imposing
Christianity on the few surviving natives as advocated by their founding
father Jefferson in his “Indian removal plan”
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_Indian_removal>).
This is the sole superpower where an ex-president spoke of a “crusade”
and “God” constantly in leading up to the invasion of Iraq, and where no
one can get elected to the president’s office without pandering to the
evangelical base and their deranged fantasies.

On the other hand if some Japanese politicians visit a shrine, the few
Japanese Christians & their mleccha backers will create an international
ruckus about “militarism”. The double standards should be clear to any
true Hindu for we experience the same everyday in India.

Based on the Japan Times article and the growing reassertion of Japan,
we can expect this trend to continue with Shinto reassuming its past
role in Japanese national life. But what does that mean for us?

**Significance of a Shinto state for Hindus**

Shinto like Sanatana Dharma remains one of the significant natural
traditions that have survived the ravages of Abrahamics around the
world. As the late doyens of Hindu revival Sita Ram Goel & Ram Swarup
used to point out, Hindus ought to be supportive of pagan revival
worldwide. The Shinto revival is also much more significant for us on
the heels of Japan & India moving closer to each other to counter
Chinese imperialism
(<https://vajrin.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/han-imperialism-and-hindu-response/>)
among other factors.

The last time the world saw two major pagan powers co-exist after
Christianity & Islam came into being was when the Sassanid empire
co-existed with that of Harshavardhana’s empire in Northern India. The
Hindus of those days used to trade with Arabia but failed to see the
storm that was brewing in the sands of Arabia just like the Sassanids.
Harsha failed to send any assistance to the Sassanids being shattered by
jihad and soon the Muslims were knocking on our own doors. We have yet
to recover from the events that followed. Subsequently when the pagan
Mongols arose as a power we were under the heel of the Khilji Muslim
tyranny and when Japan became a world power at the turn of the 20^(th)
century we were a British colony.

Today after over a millennium, we finally have a chance to reassert
ourselves along with the Japanese. We do not know how the future will
unfold but if we reestablish a Hindu state and the Japanese reestablish
a Shinto state, it will have been over a millennium since the world will
have seen two significant pagan powers coexist at the same time in the
Old World.

This is the significance of the events that are unfolding today which
few supposed Hindu right wingers know or understand in our experience.
Instead we have otherwise sensible Hindu authors hankering after mleccha
“new atheists” as our “allies” without realizing that these are hostile
enemies and are just a secularized version of Abrahamic cults. It is
tragic that successors of Vishnugupta and Vishnusharman fail to
understand who our true allies and enemies are. Hindus ought to stop
being naval gazers and take stock of the events unfolding Eastward and
their significance for us.

Many obstacles remain of course, especially for the Hindus a majority of
whom are completely delusional or ignorant and pine for nonsense such as
“true secularism” instead of the re-establishment of a Hindu rashtra.
The Japanese nationalists are in a better position as they do not have
too many Muslims & Christians spreading their destructive tentacles as
we do in India. But they still remain a nation occupied by the mlecchas
and follow a constitution imposed by the mlecchas which they hope to
overturn. May the Gods grant victory to both peoples in these endeavors.
