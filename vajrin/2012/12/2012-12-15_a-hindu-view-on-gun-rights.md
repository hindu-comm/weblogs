A Hindu view on Gun control

Another shooting in the US, more hysteria from Hindu “right wing” on
twitter and the pattern repeats itself.

It is interesting to note that these alleged Hindu “right wing” crowd
don’t ever dare question India’s gun control over countless atrocities
against Hindus by their *Muslim brothers*. It is also interesting to
note how they selectively ignore countries such as Switzerland with very
high gun ownership rates and very little gun crime, perhaps because it
pokes holes into their shoddy theories.

They didn’t find it pertinent to ask how 26/11 could have happened if
gun control worked. They never ask how well gun control worked out for
Hindu Kashmiris or the Bodos.

The truth is that these are no Hindus or right wingers but arm chair
liberals living in the safety of America or some other place of safety.
They think the masses of Hindus are nincompoops and should be abandoned
to their fate if Muslims attack them, in other words Hindus have no
right to self defense.

But what do Hindu texts and tradition say about the right to bear arms?

Acharya Medhatithi (9^(th) century CE) answers this question in his
Manubhashya when he points out that a Kshatriya is to live by bearing
weapons, but common people are also permitted to bear arms for self
protection. In support of this he points out that the king’s arms cannot
reach all men, and that there are some wicked men who attack the most
valiant of the king’s officers, but are afraid of persons bearing arms.

The Hindu tradition from the earliest times has been that the right to
self defense cannot be outsourced to the government and this has always
been the practice of Hindu kings. Indeed this is how Hindus survived
centuries of Muslim tyranny, the common people being armed would resist
the tyranny of Muslims using their weapons.

Let us look at history:

So how did weapons control & disarmament of Hindus begin?

It began with Muslim tyrants such as Aurangzeb who issued the following
order:

> In March 1695, all the Hindus, with the exception of the Rajputs, were
> forbidden to travel in palkis, or ride on elephants or thorough-bred
> horses, **or to carry arms.** (Muntakhab-ul-Lubab, ii, 395;
> Maasir-i-Alamgiri, 370 and News Letter, 11 December 1694).

Imagine the fate of our ancestors if Hindu rulers had practiced bow
control, matchlock control, or sword control. The result would have been
enmasse foreskin control of the unarmed population by Muslims.

Now we move forward a few centuries, the British were now the rulers of
India and the 1857 rebellion breaks out which shakes British control.
How was this rebellion made possible?

By an armed populace of course, Tatya Tope did not do Satyagraha but
fired guns against the Christian British tyrants. Unfortunately the
rebellion failed but the British had learned their lesson and began a
systematic disarmament campaign of Hindus along with suppression of
Hindu martial arts. In 1878, Lord Lytton helped pass the “Indian Arms
Act” which made it illegal for any Indian to possess arms unless he was
considered a loyal subject of the empire. Europeans in India were of
course exempted from this act.

Even the ahimsa monger Gandhi had recognized this great crime of the
British tyrants & commented:

> *Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will
> look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.*
>
> — Mahatma Gandhi (An Autobiography OR The story of my experiments with
> truth, by M.K. Gandhi, p.238)

In fact before India’s independence from the British, one of the items
on the Congress party platform was lifting the arms control imposed by
the British. But the brown sahibs who replaced the gora sahibs thought
the average Hindu was an idiot who cannot be allowed to defend himself,
the same view held by fake Hindu “right wing” today.

To conclude, these fake Hindus & “right wingers” have more in common
with Aurangzeb and the British than with the traditions of our
ancestors. If they had been living under Aurangzeb they would have no
doubt supported his efforts to disarm Hindus.

These people have no shame or conscience because they know they never
have to face the guns of the terrorists as the common people did on
26/11 or Hindu Kashmiris during their ethnic cleansing by Muslims or
more recently the Bodos at the hands of illegal Muslims. Many live in
the safety of the West or in affluent non-Muslim majority areas in India
while demanding that everyday Hindus be made defenceless.

People such as these are more dangerous to the survival of Hindu
civilization than any Kasab & every right thinking Hindu should
emphatically reject gun control.
