sarva dharma samabhAva – an Astika view

sarva dharma samabhAva is much preached by many modern day Hindus as the
very essence of Hindu dharma. In a way, it can be stated that sarva
dharma samabhAva is a very old concept and was as such practiced to an
extent by the ancient Astikas. But there are clear demarcations
regarding which religions must be accorded this respect. Not all
religions were given this treatment.

Jayanta Bhat.t.a, in his drama ‘Agamad.ambara’, explains the need for a
kind of ‘sarva dharma sammAna’ in a society and in the same breath also
states that only certain religions can be accorded this respect. After
explaining why all religious texts must have their source in Is’vara, he
qualifies this statement as follows (Agamad.ambara, caturtha an\~kaH):

After the argument made by DhairyarAs’i in favor of considering all
religions as divine in origin, DhairyarAs’i is made to state the
pUrvapaks.a as follows –

“nanu caivam atiprasan\~ga dos.Ad atimAtram bhuvi viplaveta dharmaH

kva nu nAma na s’akyam etad ittham gaditum yAdr.s’a tAdr.s’e (a)pi
vAkye”

Translation: But if we follow this, due to the mistake of unwarranted
extension of rule, there will be utter confusion about dharma on earth.
Tell me a situation where one cannot say that about any religion
(literally “just as that, this as well” – thus, resulting in unwarranted
extension).



DhairyarAs’i answers as follows:

“aviccinnA yes.Am vahati saran.iH sarvaviditA

na yatrAryo lokaH paricayakathAlApavimukhaH

yadis.t.Anus.t.hAnam nakhalu janabAhyam na sabhayam

na rUpam yes.Am ca sphurati navam abhyutthitam iva

pramattagItatvam alaukikatvam AbhAti lobhAdi na yatra mUlam

tatha vidhAnAm ayam AgamAnAm prAmAnyamArgo na tu yatra tatra”

Following are the laks.an.as of the religions which can be accorded the
respect:

1.  It must have an unbroken line of teachers
2.  **Aryas** (people of noble conduct) **are not repulsed by
    associating with it or discussing its tenets**
3.  **Its cherished practices must not be against social norms nor
    fearful**
4.  It must not be entirely too new in form or a just born religion
5.  It **must not be based on mad ramblings** nor must it be too unusual
    (or even otherworldly – ‘alaukika’ is the word used)
6.  It **must not be rooted in undesirable gun.as like greed** (lobha)

Those religions which do not satisfy the above conditions cannot be
validated as acceptable nor accorded the respect of being divine in
origin.

We must learn these rules for evaluating any religion. We must read the
basic tenets and texts of the religion which is to be judged and arrive
at a conclusion based on the rules given above.

We can see that Jayanta Bhat.t.a, the great naiyAyika (logician), has
given some simple rules to arrive at a logical conclusion about the
validity of any religion. Hindus of the present age must follow
Jayanta’s footsteps on this issue.
