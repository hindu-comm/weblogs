**1) Fuel:** [Railways can be run
profitably](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2011/10/why-tokyos-privately-owned-rail-systems-work-so-well/389/)
using domestically produced electricity unlike cars, motorbikes etc
which require us to fork over enormous amounts of money to import oil
from Mohammedan states like Saudi which then turn around and finance our
doom (“the kuffar will supply us with the rope with which we shall hang
them”). Unlike electric cars or scooters which need constant subsidies
from the taxpayers and merely shift our dependence to PRC & Chile for
Lithium, trains can run on power generated using hydro or coal and do so
without subsidies when properly managed as is the case in Japan.

The US blessed by abundant sources of oil was still not immune to
Mohammedan blackmail during the 1970’s oil shocks. Ever since then the
country’s dependence on foreign oil has been regarded as a national
security issue and various efforts have been made to reduce oil
consumption. However, the country is built around the automobile and
this is a key reason for its continued dependence on foreign oil
according to authors such as [Vaclav
Smil](http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-2011-AAAG.pdf).
The same point has also been made by conservative authors William S.
Lind and Paul M. Weyrich in their paper [“A Conservative Proposal for
Energy
Independence”](https://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/conservative-energy-independence-FCF.pdf)
where they promote railways over roads due to reasons of national
security.

[According to Peter Drucker’s article “Behind Japan’s Success” from
1981](https://hbr.org/1981/01/behind-japans-success), the following was
MITI’s stand on automobiles and roads:

> MITI has also believed, quite sincerely, that expansion of the
> automobile industry would have an adverse, indeed a deleterious,
> effect on Japan’s balance of trade, on her ability to earn her way in
> the world economy, and on her productivity generally. The more
> successful the Japanese automobile industry, MITI has argued, the
> worse the economic impact on Japan. The automobile, it has pointed
> out, requires the two raw materials that are in shortest supply in
> Japan: petroleum and iron ore. It also requires the diversion of
> scarce resources, both food-growing land and capital, to highways and
> highway construction. Instead of an automobile industry, what MITI has
> wanted is massive investment to upgrade the railroads’
> freight-handling capacity.

Note the point about freight rail, and it is in this regard that the
partly JICA funded [dedicated freight
corridor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpNO6B-7CBo) is very important
as it will separate out slow moving freight from passenger rail while
decreasing our oil imports.

In wartime, [oil becomes the most vital
commodity](https://books.google.com/books?id=C6pGQvVqNAoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+prize+epic+quest+for+oil&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)
and the allies cutting off all oil was a key reason why Japan decided to
attack the USA. [A key reason for allied victory in both world
wars](https://www.socialmatter.net/2015/07/26/hidden-history-oil-won-world-war-ii/)
was the abundant oil supplies USA possessed. Instead of conserving and
storing oil, we are frittering it away on frivolities such as cars while
we hardly have any domestic oil reserves to speak of.

**2) Coverage:** Any one of a reasonable age can ride a train/mass
transit but private vehicles exclude those who cannot drive. Some of
these demographics include those below 18, the disabled and senior
citizens. The US is the most car centric major nation and as a result
you find strange phenomena such as 15 year olds being driven everywhere
by their parents because there are no alternatives available. At the
other extreme you have [Japan where 98% of public school kids either
walk or cycle to
school](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3477970/). The
following 2 videos offer our contrasting futures based on what we choose
now:

**3) Land:** Railways require less land than most roads and that is
visible even to the naked eye of an onlooker. This is especially
important in the old world where many countries including India have
dense populations and agricultural land is of great value. In the US by
contrast there remain vast stretches of untamed wilderness and empty
land, so that country can afford to take a lackadaisical and wasteful
attitude towards land but can we?

According to Lee Kuan Yew the founding father of modern Singapore:

> [We cannot have everybody own a
> car](https://books.google.com/books?id=TN5UAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=We+cannot+have+everybody+own+a+car,+however+high+our+per+capita+income+may+be:+our+young+must+accept+the+fact+that+we+cannot+lee+kuan+yew&source=bl&ots=dE3E1QMgK_&sig=cgaew8cLK6i5RNsa9qgpi8js8hI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn0uCG9s3eAhUn7IMKHQnzC3oQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=We%20cannot%20have%20everybody%20own%20a%20car%2C%20however%20high%20our%20per%20capita%20income%20may%20be%3A%20our%20young%20must%20accept%20the%20fact%20that%20we%20cannot%20lee%20kuan%20yew&f=false),

He came to this conclusion after he found that no matter how many
flyovers he built or how wide he made the roads, they would all soon be
filled up thanks to the phenomenon of [induced
demand.](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/)

And the above is just in regards to the roads where as roads are only a
small part of the space vehicles occupy. We also have to consider the
enormous amounts of land dedicated to “free” (i.e. socialized) parking
and the perverse effects of minimum parking laws. A quick summary can be
found in this video:

Just think about the fact that people are more concerned about
[“free”](https://nihone.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/pay-for-parking/)
storage spaces for their cars while there are people out there homeless
in places such as San Francisco due to lack of affordable housing!

**4) Safety:** Trains run on dedicated tracks separate from other
traffic and as such are remarkably safe compared to vehicular travel.
[They are one of the reasons why a vast city such as Tokyo has so few
traffic related deaths and
injuries](https://www.businessinsider.com/one-of-the-worlds-biggest-cities-has-figured-how-to-virtually-eliminate-traffic-deaths-2015-7).
The Shinkansen is estimated to have prevented thousands of deaths and
injuries by eliminating the trips that would have taken place by road.
[According the government’s own stats the following is the current
record of death & mayhem on Indian
roads:](https://mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2018-pdfs/rs-03012018/1830.pdf)

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list1.png?w=660)

How many of these people would still be alive & have all their limbs
intact if they had viable alternatives to driving?

[For comparison in 2017 the number of traffic deaths in Japan was only
3,694](https://www.nippon.com/en/behind/l10701/). In other words, India
had almost 41 times as many dead despite our population only being
around 10 times as much as Japan’s while also having far fewer elderly
drivers (responsible for many fatalities in Japan) and a far lower per
capita car ownership.

I leave it up to the readers on whether this is the road we should
continue on in into the future.

**5) Physical activity:** This might seem strange, what exactly do
trains have to do with physical activity and health?

Trains and mass transit do not come to your door step and instead force
you to reach them and people often do this by walking or cycling to the
station. In countries with extensive transit such as Japan (in Tokyo, a
train station is usually within a 15 min walk no matter where you are in
the city), [walking is thus built into everyday
life](https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/10/obesity-housing-density-suburbs-research/542433/)
and it is not something for which you have to drive to a paid gym to
walk on a treadmill.

[In 2002, the average Japanese person 15 years and above walked 3 ¾
miles daily (7,241 steps) vs 5608 steps by
Americans](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/14321/1/tr06-02s.pdf)
and that undoubtedly also plays a role in the low obesity rates found in
Japan. The choice is between:

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list12.jpg?w=660)

and

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list11.jpg?w=660)

**6) Pollution:** [Trains consume a lot less
energy](https://web.stanford.edu/~plipscy/JapanTransport2012-2-22.pdf)
because the friction generated by wheel on rail is a lot less compared
to the friction generated by rubber on asphalt. Road dust is also a
serious concern in India which still has quite a few unpaved roads.
[Road travel is also connected with particulate emissions by
tires](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2013/wp29grpe/GRPE-65-20e.pdf),
and horrendous noise pollution (especially with the constant honking in
India).

If the clownish supreme court of India was serious about pollution, it
would look into the contribution to pollution by cars and motorbikes
instead of making scapegoats out of kids bursting a few crackers once or
twice a year.

The geniuses in black robes don’t seem to realize that the problem is
this

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list13.jpg?w=660)

instead of this:

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list14.jpg?w=660)

**7) Productivity:** Traveling by train allows you to read, get work
done etc., all of which would be impossible when driving. Even if one
were forced to stand, it is not an obstacle to reading in this age of
smart phones.

The choice is between:

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list15.jpg?w=660)

and

![list1](https://vajrin.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/list16.jpg?w=660)

**8) Community life:** [Train stations can serve as hubs of community
life with shopping, daycare, and a myriad other services as in
Japan](https://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00055/). By contrast roads
when they are dominated by vehicles push out pedestrians, and the
streets merely become a means for vehicle owners to rush through. We
often hear of demolitions of centuries old temples for road expansion
and what no one seems to question is how the same temple was no problem
a few decades before the explosion of vehicles on our streets.

Consider too what has happened to the sight of kids walking to school or
playing in the streets which used to be a much more common sight just a
few decades back. Today few parents dare to let them do so thanks to the
incessant traffic and reckless drivers. Yet one finds this to be a
common sight in Japan with its narrow streets where pedestrians rule and
Japan’s per capita income nearly 20X India’s. As several western
observers noted, [“Japanese cities are defiantly anti-modern and
anti-rational”.](https://thediplomat.com/2010/11/japans-alluring-streets-and-gardens/)In
fact there is little causal relation between owning vehicles and being a
“developed” country. The Japanese road system was quiet underdeveloped
well into the 1980’s compared to Europe and USA but their per capita
income had already caught up with the West. Even today most [Japanese
highways tend to be heavily tolled and only consist of two lanes in each
direction with lanes being narrower than western highway
lanes](https://seattletransitblog.com/2009/04/17/japans-highways/).

Those interested in the connection between traffic and the death of
community life can look up the extensive research of Donald Appleyard on
this topic.

**9) National security infrastructure:** Railways are not as useful or
crucial as they once were during war due to the development of airpower
but they can still play an important role in upholding the internal
security of the nation state. [The military in PRC has conducted HSR
test runs with soldiers fully loaded in their combat gear to Xinjiang to
see railways performance.](https://warisboring.com/high-speed-rail/) The
objective is to rapidly deploy troops to put down any future [Dungan
jihad.](https://books.google.com/books?id=AtduqAtBzegC&dq=holy+war+in+china+hodong+kim&source=gbs_navlinks_s)
They already used trains to [rapidly deploy troops to crush the Tibetan
uprising in
2008.](http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37698&no_cache=1#.VmwiUEorLeM)

As a nation facing multiple insurgencies by religion of peace, religion
of love, and religion of Marx, it is important the we prepare to deal
with what circumstances will throw at us in the future.

These are just some of the reasons on why rail transport should be
prioritized and we [have not even touched on personal financial
benefits](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/)
(just calculate what % of income you are forced to spend on your vehicle
including fuel costs, repair and maintenance).

At a moment when economically advanced countries ([e.g. Netherlands,
Denmark, Norway, France,
Spain](https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-going-car-free-ban-2017-8))
are questioning their past transport choices and reorienting towards
more sustainable transport, let us not repeat their mistakes [for as the
ancient Greek historian Polybius says in his
“Histories”:](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html)

> For there are two ways by which all men can reform themselves, the one
> through their own mischances, the other through those of others, and
> of these the former is the more impressive, but the latter less
> hurtful. Therefore we should never choose the first method if we can
> help it, as it corrects by means of great pain and peril, but ever
> pursue the other, since by it we can discern what is best without
> suffering hurt. Reflecting on this we should regard as the best
> discipline for actual life the experience that accrues from serious
> history; for this alone makes us, without inflicting any harm on us,
> the most competent judges of what is best at every time and in every
> circumstance.
