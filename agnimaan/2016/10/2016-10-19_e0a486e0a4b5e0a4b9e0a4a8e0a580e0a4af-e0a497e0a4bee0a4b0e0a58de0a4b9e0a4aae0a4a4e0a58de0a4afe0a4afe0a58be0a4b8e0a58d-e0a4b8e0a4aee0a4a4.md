“Of these the squaring of the circle is central to the construction of
an AhavanIya and gArhapatya of equal area and a multiple approximations
are suggested by different yajurvedic traditions. Similar constructions
to these yajurvedic attempts are seen in the Rhind papyrus and the work
of Anaxagoras. Several millennia later the 26 year old Ramanujan
supplied one of the best approximations for the squaring of the circle –
the one shown above. With this he gets a fraction for approximating pi
as 355/113 – one which would have made his yajurvedic ancestor proud.”

“To experience the greatness of great men one has to relive or redo some
acts of theirs to the best of ones ability. In ones youth such
enactments might inspire one to make a bid for greatness. Whether this
happens or not is mostly up to your genetics. Nevertheless, through the
enactments one can at least savor the experience of what it takes to get
there. If there was one man in our midst who could have lived up to be a
Gauss or an Euler it was Srinivasa Ramanujan.”
