Fist of the day-wrestler.



“मुष्टिर्वासरमल्लस्य ध्वान्तवैरिविभेदनः। अदित्यश् चक्रदम्पत्योः
स्नोहग्रन्थिः पुनातु वः॥”



I hear that songs get stuck in some people’s heads. I count myself lucky
that verses (such as the above by Shankar) stick in mine. Because they
can often be used as mantra-s.

For example, I find the above quite effective to recite, visualize and
feel the power of the thousand rayed sol – just see the power in “fist
of the day-wrestler trouncing the darkness-foe”. I particularly find it
useful at times when the revered gAyatrI-mantra is simply not effective
or appropriate (eg. – you aren’t in a mental or circumstantial position
to do a proper japa).
