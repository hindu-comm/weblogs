The “mlecCha > dalit” stupidity.

One aspect where the jAti-system was completely rotten – especially in
the madhouse of keraLa, where a low-jAti person converted to a muslim or
christian would be treated much better. This contributed to their
increase in numbers. Enjoy the fruits of your forefathers, you keraLa
hindus! अश्वं नैव गजं नैव व्याघ्रं नैव च नैव च \| अजापुत्रं बलिं
दद्याद्देवो दुर्बलघातक: \|\| applies to these idiots as well.

-   “…they were more influential and respected than the natives
    themselves so that many of the heathen became Moors in such manner
    that they were more people than the natives by a diabolical method
    which the Moors found l because in this region of Malabar the race
    of gentlemen is called Nairs who are the people of war they are
    people who are very refined in blood and customs and separated from
    all other low people and so much do they value themselves that no
    one of them ever turned Moor only the low people turned Moors who
    worked in the bush and in the fields And these people are so
    accursed that they cannot go by any road without shouting so that
    the Nairs may not come up suddenly and meet them because they kill
    them at once for they always carry their arms and these low people
    may not carry arms to defend themselves and when they go along thus
    shouting if any Nair shouts to them they at once get into the bush
    very far from the road The Moors understanding that it was a good
    way to increase their sect said to the King and to the rulers of the
    places in which they traded that they met with great difficulties
    with their merchandise because they had not got labourers to cart it
    from one point to another because the labourers being low people
    could not go amongst other people as the Nairs would kill them
    whenever they met them and therefore they would esteem it a favour
    if those of the low people who might turn Moors should be able to go
    freely wherever they pleased since being Moors they would then be
    outside of the Malabar religion and usages and that they might be
    able to touch all sorts of people because if this was not agreed to
    they would not be able to transport their goods to sell them in
    their provinces At the same time giving some fees to the magistrates
    and confidantes of the King they succeeded in getting this consented
    to On which account these low people desired to enjoy so great an
    advantage because they were such accursed people that they lived in
    the bush and in fields where they ate nothing but herbs and laud
    crabs and by becoming Moors they could go where they liked and gain
    their livelihood and eat as they pleased When they became Moors the
    Moors gave them cloths and robes with which to clothe themselves and
    so many of them became Moors and were converted to the religion of
    Mohammed and they increased so much in numbers that all the country
    became full of them which caused these Moors to be very influential
    and powerful by their trade through all the countries and especially
    in this country of Malabar and above all in this city of Calecut
    where they had their principal “
-   “1 The diabolical method of the Moors was to set their faces against
    distinctions of race whilst the Portuguese adopted them and have
    perpetuated them by the word of their own language which expresses
    race namely casta.”

Another similar observation from Albuquerque a few decades later (from
[here](http://www.uwosh.edu/osscap/present/oshkosh-scholar/past-volumes/2013-volume-viii/submissions/mannosvol8-6finalweb.pdf)):

-   “Albuquerque states this hybridizationsuccinctly from an early
    modern Portuguese viewpoint: “They marry as many wives as they
    cansupport and keep as well many heathen concubines of low caste.
    If they have sons or daughtersby these they make them Moors, and
    ofttimes the mother as well, and thus this evil generationcontinues
    to increase in Malabar.””
