shAhu!

================================================================

Bajirao had become a national hero, in whom all hopes of safety for the
Hindu religion were concentrated. The common danger had united the
Rajputs completely with the Marathas as Hindus.

(iv)� � � A Plan to Create Hindu Empire at Delhi:

Dhondo Govind (61) wrote from Delhi to Bajirao :

The question of creating a Hindu Empire took firm hold. The Rana of
Udaypur was fully prepared now for this proposal, when Bajirao had
undertaken to stand behind it. The Rana sent Gumansing (62) to Sawai
Jaysing, who told him that Raya wished to place Ranaji on the throne of
Delhi. Ranaji had told that all his wealth (for this purpose) belonged
to Raya and that Raya and Sawaiji were his men of trust. Gokulchand was
sent to Abhaysing and Bundelas were expected to join the union. Thus by
the end of May1739 A.D., the Rajput Chief�s prepared themselves for the
drastic change and were eagerly expecting Bajirao�s arrival in the
North.

� � � � � � Bajirao was at Burhanpur (63) at the time of the sack of
Delhi, by Nadirshah. About the question of creating a Hindu monarchy at
Delhi, Shahu informed him his sentiments in a letter dated 31st May 1739
A.D. The letter reads (64) ,

> �that it should be our duty to resuscitate the falling Mughal Empire,
> that the Chhatrapati, as you are already aware, does not aspire to
> secure the imperial position for himself, that he considers it a
> higher merit to renovate an old dilapidated edifice than to build a
> new one. If we attempt the other course (i.e. a Hindu monarchy) it
> would involve us in enmity with all our neighbors with the consequence
> that we would be exposed to unnecessary dangers and court a crop of
> trouble all round.�

Shahu was moderate in his aims and desired to secure only the
administrative management for the Marathas in the capacity of the
Amir-ul-Umara of the Mughal Empire. It was his desire that by supporting
whole-heartedly Muhammad Shah�s regime, they should collect the revenue
of the Country and after recovery of the expanses for the troops, should
pay the balance into the Imperial treasury.

But even though the Peshwa complied finally with the commands of the
Chhatrapati, he was really much more ambitious and definitely a Hindu
State was in his mind (65).

For the present Tohmast Kuli (Nadirshah) has won the fight. But if all

North (it is a lime) for the Hindu Empire to come into existence. ”
