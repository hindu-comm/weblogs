Request school data from India parents.

Please help and answer the following 10 quick questions:

===  
Background:  
In USA, public schools are quite good (at least as good as one can
expect those usually life-sucking worker-making factories to be). But I
know nothing about India of today.

If we live in India, I definitely want the kids (if they don’t
homeschool under my able tutelage :-) ) to receive good education – one
which is preferably NOT English medium (Hindi/ Telugu/ Marathi/ blah
blah – any Hindu language is good). And I don’t want to remain a
“coolie” and sacrifice all of my life to money-grubbing just so my kids
attend some ridiculous “international” school.
