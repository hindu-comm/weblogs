The svayameva mRgendrataa fraud.



The RSS / HSS motto “स्वयमेव मृगेन्द्रता” (\~ supremacy by one’s own
merits) comes from a beautiful subhAShita – “नाभिषेको न संस्कारः सिंहस्य
क्रियते वने । विक्रमार्जितसत्त्वस्य स्वयमेव मृगेंद्रता ॥ “. You see it
on some of their shirts etc..

![wy4ybu3](https://agnimaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/wy4ybu3.jpg?w=584)



But, in actual fact, nothing could be farther than the truth. Far from
producing mRgendra-s, they seem to be good at turning everyone to
(fairly timid) sheeple. They are like good ants at best. While they are
a fair place to make friends and develop a support network, it is the
idiot who will expect his or her talents to bloom for the good of the
dharma in “the sangh”. People not interested in mediocrity and stupefied
conformity will not fit in.  
From my observation of them, it’s more like: “पिपीलिका वयं सर्वे सङ्घे
शक्तिः कलौ युगे। स्वयमेव मृगेन्द्रत्वं स्वप्नेऽपि नैव रोचते॥”  
==============================  
Postscript

The ensuing conversation has led me to deduce that perhaps the main
(limited) remaining value of the RSS is to produce svayamsevaka-s like
kRShNashAstri, prachAraka-s who get loaned to various mission-specific
organizations etc.. Perhaps their work is what mRgendratA in the logo
might be alluding to. But, is it the most efficient way of doing so? Is
the cost too high? I am not sure.

Barring such gems, I still suspect that most people get sucked into a
lot of time-pass in the guise of actual service to the dharma, and that
this is overall detrimental.

SS:: Not sure what your problem is with RSS. Maybe their system doesn’t
appeal to you, but it is undeniable that they have done and are doing
much service to the nation and at grassroots level lots of mice are at
least given backbone (if not turned into lions or tigers) due to
participation in RSS. IMO FWIW Hindutva would certainly be in a worse
position without RSS.

AM: RSS has made (and continues to make) great contributions to the
hindu society – no denying that. But at what cost? (And \*everything\*
has a cost.)In other words, I am not sure if we would be in a worse
position without RSS. All that talent and frustration lulled into a
false sense of security and accomplishment might have been doing
something bolder and more worthwhile.

AM: “RSS doesn’t ask you to resign from Google to be a svayamsevak. My
father (a doctor) was jillaa bauddhik pramukh for quite some time. His
cousin was a practising advocate in Chennai (now a High Court judge) and
served as nagar kaaryavaah. These people didn’t (and don’t) waste their
talent. Only a small fraction of svayamsevaks are full-time and most of
their talent is to be social workers. ” -> I am not saying that not
being a doctor or engineer or lawyer despite qualifications and talent
in that area is the cost of RSS. Having gone to a few shAkhA-s and met
quite a few prachArak-s I am aware that is not the case. The cost is
something else.

Let me put it like this: What if all these people joined and contributed
to some other organization in their free time? Suppose RSS was not
there, what would they be doing? Say Hindu Munnaani or HMK or some
mission specific group such as samskrita bhaaratii or that group of
tamiL lawyers which specializes in litigating against the sickular
government to fight misappropriation of temple property? Does being a
svayamsevaka or a “jillaa bauddhik pramukh” or “nagar kaaryavaah” (with
all their endless bhaiTak-s) fill one with misplaced satisfaction? To
what extant does service to the organization translate into service to
the society? 10:1?

“Even from the individual (rather than society) POV, RSS is like
gurukula system for the masses in that it will teach you a lot of
samskara-s you’d probably not learn otherwise…” – Sure, that
peer-influence is to be acknowledged. But to a very limited degree for
most people. (RSS schools and Ekal Vidyalaya do a good job there
specially.) Lot of organizations do that – including the many
baabaa-doms (real or fake).

Rather, the main benefit \*was\* that it provided a forum for people who
cared about hindutva to get together and slightly increase the chance
that they will meet someone who is as enthusiastic and bold as them
about their particular projects (when one does not get frustrated by the
platitude spouting mass or worse – deliberate stonewalling by the
pipiilikaa-s). But that is more or less obviated by social media and
meetup’s in this age.

PC:: Are you sure it is the motto of RSS also?  
Also, perhaps they are the same idiots (who expected their talents to
bloom for the good of the dharma in “the sangh”) who started
organizations like Samskrita Bharati, BJP and hundreds others.  
Perhaps you meant to point out the “mellow-ness” rather than “mediocrity
and stupefied conformity”?

AM:  
AM: In response to the first question: No, PC. Emblem may be? Or popular
catch phrase? Whatever it may be, it is a way of lulling svayamsevak-s
into thinking they are part of some shivAji’s army.

“Also, perhaps they are the same idiots (who expected their talents to
bloom for the good of the dharma in “the sangh”) who started
organizations like Samskrita Bharati, BJP and hundreds others.” – Note
that this did not and cannot happen with the RSS. They had to seek out
and collaborate with \*many\* non-RSS people.

“Perhaps you meant to point out the “mellow-ness” rather than
“mediocrity and stupefied conformity”?” -> Definitely the latter. It is
based on personal observations which I will not elaborate on for fear of
offending people further other than to note a pervasive assertive
self-assured groupthink.

AM:  
AM: “” Note that this did not and cannot happen with the RSS. They had
to seek out and collaborate with \*many\* non-RSS people.” – have you
talked to Krishnasastry ji to see if this theory of yours holds any
water? Do you even have anecdotal evidence to corroborate this?” —->  
Absolutely – anecdotal evidence. shrI kRShNashAstri is not the kind to
give a striaght answer to such pointed questions, but that is in fact
the case. (Udayana or Venkatesh Murthy, who have a lot of background may
please correct me by providing contrary information.)  
=========  
First to summarize how exactly RSS helped foster sanskrita bhAratI (by
which I include its earlier 1981-birthed life as the Sanskrit wing of
the Hindu Seva Pratishthanam).  
\* It is quite conceivable that the spirit of popular activism
(reminiscent of HSS/ RSS sampark) that inspired kRShNashAstrI likely
came from RSS (not that it would not have otherwise come from
elsewhere). Some part of the organizational template (heavy dependence
on volunteers for example) likely comes from RSS.  
\* The specific goal of sanskrit popularization came from his
conversation with a senior RSS person. This is a personal influence, not
an organizational influence.  
\* RSS provides and provided ready access to people who accomodate
samskrita bhAratI people in their travels as part of their mission.  
=========  
That’s it. RSS more or less is non committal (as usual) about sanskrit
(or even Indian language) revival. No change in shAkhA format, no urging
the svayamsevak-s to learn some sanskrit etc.. So, just focus on what
\*unique\* things has RSS given in summary? The general volunteer-based
activism template is the main contribution. Infrastructure (contacts and
short term accommodation) support comes next. Even there, would these
NOT have been available were it not for RSS? I daresay no. RSS is not
the best (or only) template for volunteer based popular activism. It’s
an old and persistent feature of Hindu samAja.  
=========  
You have yourself acknowledged that they needed to collaborate with
“new” people. Very true – this was essential. To reiterate this point –
mahAbaleshvara bhaTTa? not from RSS. janArdhana hegde? not from RSS. HR
Vishwas? Not from RSS.  
=========

“I see that lot of activists want to blame Sangh for “mediocrity”. Well
I see that most Hindu activists (more so outside Sangh) are mediocre.”
—> I must reiterate that this mediocrity is not central, but is a
consequence of my main point of stupefaction and “opportunity cost” of
the RSS (more below). It does not do to focus on the branches rather
than the trunk.

“But Sangh of course is a easy punching bag.” —> It is not only an easy
punching bag, but it \*\*\*has\*\*\* to be the primary punching bag, as
it is forms the bulk of hindu activism today. The elephant cannot
complain that birds around it aren’t getting as much (negative)
attention.

====  
The most important point is that: RSS is doing something right – it has
ensured it’s own survival and propagation. But at the expense of other
more potent modes of activism. Take this analogy: MK Gandhi’s popular
movement reduced the attractiveness (by a great degree) of other modes
of hindu activism (like RSS). In the very same way, RSS is having a
definite negative effect on the growth of even firmer and better
grounded modes of hindu activism.

It is like sticking lollypop into the mouths of a lot of people who
actually want laDDu-s.  
====

An ancilliary point is this:  
Generally organizations with a specific goal (Ekal, Samskrita bhAratI,
yoga-bhAratI, Art of Living etc..) accomplish far more than
organizations with a vaguer and broader agenda (eg: RSS). The latter
class, overall, diminishes interest in and competes with the former
class.

AM: And, to respond to ” You try to present it as if these people had to
leave the fold of Sangh and get converted out of it (like a Christian
conversion) to do all of that.” –  
it is very much the case that they “leave” the RSS behind. How
frequently do people heavily involved in these other organizations get
the time or (more to the point) inclination to attend shAkhA or
meetings? More often than not, they’ll be like “bah. whatever. I want to
get real stuff done.”

I’ve already done due diligence with regards to what I’ve stated here,
but am happy to revise my understanding if new facts point otherwise.

(And, the last part of your response is an example of “argumentum ad
homineim” <http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html>, and is
worthy of being disregarded. It is not very important if people are
pissed off with HSS and its prominent defenders for whatever reason
including but not limited to lack of basic courtesy.)  
Argumentum Ad Hominem

AM: That said, I would be remiss in not pointing out the “beat the nail
that sticks out” attitude in the RSS/ HSS quoting your very words “while
being pathetic and eccentric themselves”. This is exactly the kind of
stupefaction that I speak about, where eccentricity is considered
negative. मृगेन्द्रता my ass.

AM  
Further points from shrI NS:  
”  
Krishnashatry ji himself told this when he met us last time in Bay Area.
Ask him why he goes to shakha. There might be something he thinks is
important that you might be missing.

One more fact: Dinesh Kamat ji – a senior prachark was given to Sanskrit
Bharati if you didn;t know that. He was Sanghatan mantri last I checked
and was instrumental in many of the new initiatives of Sanskrit Bharati.

Suresh ji in Bangalore also was given to Sanskrit Bharati in Karnataka
and last I heard he has returned to HSP after many years there. These
are only a few examples, I am sure there are many in each state.  
”

“K Suryanarayanrao ji, one of the senior most pracharaks was the
president of Samskruta Bharati for a very long time while he still was
Akhila Bharatiya Sewa Pramukh in RSS. I am indeed surprised you didn’t
know any of that.”
