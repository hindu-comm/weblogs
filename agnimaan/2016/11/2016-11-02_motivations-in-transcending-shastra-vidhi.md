Motivations in transcending shAstra-vidhi

# A running example

Suppose that an Agama (composed a millennium ago) says that only a
member of a certain family or class can serve as an archaka in certain
temples.Shouldsuch a qualification be enforcedtoday with ruthless
strictness (ie no exceptions)?

One’s answer may be “yes” or “no” due to myriadreasons. Let’s examine
the reasons.

# Motivations for promoting change

## Reasons with roots in ashraddhA

-   **Stupid ego**: This was presented as a possible cause by shrI
    ghorAngIrasa –
    [TW16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/698560001808457728),
    based on “यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः। न स
    सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्।। BG16.23।।”. People may say:
    “screw the shAstra, my intuition knows best. aham brahmAsmi.”
-   Allegence to various non-hindu and anti-hindu memes. (communism,
    buddhism, democracy, equality etc..)

## Reasons with roots in shraddhA

[TW16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/698560001808457728),
followingshankarAchArya’s commentary to BG 17.1 (“देवादिपूजाविधिपरं
किञ्चित् शास्त्रं पश्यन्त एव तत् उत्सृज्य अश्रद्दधानतया तद्विहितायां
देवादिपूजायां श्रद्धया अन्विताः प्रवर्तन्ते इति न शक्यं कल्पयितुम्” =
“For, it cannot be imagined that even when they are aware of some
scriptural injunction about worship of gods and others, they discard
this out of their faithlessness, and yet they engage in the worship of
gods and others enjoined by those scriptures by becoming imbued with
faith!”), does not imagine any valid form of shraddhA in the shAstra for
transcending particular shAstra-vidhi-s.

But this is a **flawed caricature**and presents a lack of [sympathetic
imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) (sorry,
shankara), as:

-   One may place more value on the \*intent\* and spirit behind the
    vidhi, rather than the mere letterof the vidhi.
-   one can have shraddhA in all the vidhi-s, buttovarious degrees.
    Some may be more important than others. So, one may want to
    approximate it while trying to balance other dhArmic objectives of
    contemporary relevance.
-   Circumstances may not allow following the letter of the vidhi,
    forcing one to approximate.

Hence, we must these consideralternative reasons rooted in shraddhA.

The redoubtable PV kANe says, for example: “We need not give up the
basic principles of Hinduism, but should reorientate them to meet new
and more complex conditions and work out a changed social order”

It was such spirit which animated moves such
asतत्त्वनिष्ठ-परिवर्तनवादी-परिषत् / धर्मनिर्णयमण्डलम् (1930-60) which
formed under the guidance of the learned kevalAnanda-sarasvatI (of Wai,
Satara, MH), including eminent scholars like PV kANe, shrIdharashAstrI
pAThaka/ shankarAnanda-bhAratI, sadAshivashAstrI bhiDe, DaftarI, JS
karanDikar, prajnEneshvarayatI etc..

Such intentionsare quite noble, explicitly recognized by the
dharmashAstra-s themselves to an extant

andarefar from being stupid or inconsistent!

# Motivations for resisting change

-   Valuing tradition itself over the valuescelebrated by the
    tradition!
    -   Being practicing shiShTa-s (of the kind very rare these days),
        some peoplewere accepting of some necessary change. On the
        other hand, I have heard folks remark that non-shiShTa-s in fact
        compete if not exceed shiShTa-s in refusing any change
        whatsoever.
    -   This is akin to valuing the sheath the sword comes in more than
        the sword itself!
-   Just stupidity – inability to distinguish the essence from the
    periphery.
-   Undervaluing the need to respond tocontemporary challenges.
    -   This often comes with an undervaluing the need to understand the
        intent of the vidhi-s by understanding (among other things)
        thehistorical context in which they were composed.
-   Preservingprivilege bestowed on one’s ilk by the shAstra-s in the
    context they were composed in.
-   …
