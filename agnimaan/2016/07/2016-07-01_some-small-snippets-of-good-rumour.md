Some small snippets of good rumour.



1 Hindu right wingers getting into army and IAS in greater numbers.
Earlier they would be deliberately failed, now due to the low pay and
such the army mostlyattracts genuinely service minded people (ie the
right hindu demographic).

2 haryANvI jAT-s, in small numbers, import bAnglAdeshi brides, and
jATifying (implies also hinduifying) them solidly. (Unforseen effect of
sex ratio imbalance.) Price under a lakh.

3 A famoushindu televangelist’s son, who had fallen in“love” with an
ROP girl, is now back in the “fold” after his “love” chose to take the
money and leave him. (Conflicting reports about this.)
