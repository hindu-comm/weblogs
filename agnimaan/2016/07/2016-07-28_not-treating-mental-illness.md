(Not) treating mental “illness”

Some excerpts from an intriguing Invisibilia episode
([transcript](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/01/483856025/read-the-transcript)):

> BAXTER: Sure. At the village of Geel in Belgium, it was well-known
> that the insane have been placed under the management of the
> villagers.
>
> MILLER: Geel, it turned out, was a quite radical society, a place
> where everyday people welcomed strangers with mental illness into
> their homes.
>
> BAXTER: Like a beloved aunt or uncle.
>
> MILLER: And would allow them to stay there, often for decades.
>
> BAXTER: When I asked several foster families why they had welcomed a
> guest, they seemed confused. Why would they not? Their parents and
> grandparents had all done the same.
>
> …
>
> MILLER: First stop, the doctor’s. There’s this big medical facility
> right in the center of town called the OPZ, where patients come when
> they first arrive in Geel. They’re prescribed meds and paired with a
> therapist. And it is there that the doctors discuss and choose which
> family the patient will go and live with.
>
> …
>
> The doctors in Geel believe in its power so much that they have
> dispatched with the thing most sacred to the profession – the idea
> that there is a problem to fix. When a patient comes to stay with a
> family in Geel, they are told nothing about the diagnosis.







> Right, so the mystery began more than 50 years ago when a British
> sociologist, George Brown, made a very surprising observation. Male
> patients who were suffering from chronic schizophrenia did a lot
> better after they left the hospital when they went to live in lodgings
> rather than going home to live with their wives or their parents.
>
> …
>
> That desire to fix the problem, it oozes out of a person, they have
> found, and works to trigger relapse in the person they’re thinking
> about. …Crazy as it sounds, our private thoughts about a person, our
> disappointment in them or even our wishes for them to get better,
> shoot out of us like lasers and can change their very insides.
