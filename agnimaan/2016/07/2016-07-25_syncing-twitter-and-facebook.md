Syncing Twitter and Facebook.



You know you can cause all your tweets to automatically appear on FB and
vice versa, right?

**Twitter to Facebook** – details
[here](https://support.twitter.com/articles/31113).(while giving FB
posting permissions, make sure that the tweets appear on facebook to a
limited audience – say friend or friends of friends to avoid a feedback
loop in case you setup FB-> twitter posting)

**Facebook to Twitter** – Just set up public posts to be tweeted by
going tohttps://www.facebook.com/twitter

If you automaticallyshare from **WordPress to Facebook and Twitter** –
beware that the FB\<->Twitter syncing will cause a feedback loop.
Rather, just sync with one of them.
