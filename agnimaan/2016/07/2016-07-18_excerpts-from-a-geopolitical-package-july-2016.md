Excerpts from “A geopolitical package: July 2016”



Regaining or acquiring widespread Self-nonself distinction ability is
critical for Hindusto survive and
thrive.[Analysis](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)
by the sage of MT is astute as usual. Excerpts:

> Sultanate, the Mogol empire of Awrangzeb or as part of the Khilafat.
> There would be tensions with the Arab Khilafat eventually, but if the
> Turks reassert their place as the leaders of the Mohammedans then
> there would be greater synergy with them. Their primary strategy would
> be reestablish the connection between TSB and TSP by conquering the
> land in between, especially by taking Prāgjyotiṣa, Magadha, Pāñcāla
> and the remaining Pāñcanada in the process. As we have said they will
> apply both the glacial and hurricane strategies as the occasion
> demands. In the south an independent sultanate in Kerala would be
> their other objective which may then serve as the base for the pincer
> grip of the rest of the land.

> 3) The cīna-s will aim for a land-grab of Arunachal, Sikkim, Ladakh,
> other border zones in the Northeast, the border nations like Bhutan
> and Nepal while not having any major objectives within the inner core
> of Bhārata. Here they might initially collude with the other enemies
> but then back off because they clearly understand that the preta
> states established by the mleccha-s are footholds for mlecchas to
> reach them, whereas the Islamic states will allow Islamic expansion
> against them. But being hard-nosed people ready to do a Dungan if
> needed they would not be too concerned about propping up Hindu states

> To use someone’s words marūnmāda can advance both as a glacier and a
> whirlwind. We can see both strategies simultaneously at play. For
> example, the Moslem Brotherhood takes the glacial approach whereas the
> Khilafat under Dr. Abu Bakr takes the whirlwind approach. The same
> marūnmatta group can shift from one approach to another depending on
> the opportunities. Moreover, virulent strains of marūnmāda can persist
> even after a defeat with alternative strategies. For example Abd
> al-Wahab and Muhammad bin Saud and their successors founded the
> hellhole of Saudi Arabia by means of whirlwind Jihad campaigns
> paralleling those of Abu Bakr’s Khilafat of today. …
