Guan Yu: Pagan reverence of anything awesome

![mwoloun](https://agnimaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/mwoloun.jpg?w=584)

I went to a smog test shop, but had forgotten my wallet. There I noted
an obviously cared for statue of **Guan Yu**, a chinese deity, who I
later learned to be:

-   Essentially a deified very loyal and honorable general from 2k years
    back.
-   An equivalent of mitra or varuNa, in his care for righteousness.
-   Highly revered by business folk.
-   Revered even byeven mongols and manchus.
-   Accepted by multiple streams of chinese reverence (made a buddhist
    guardian by a zen master according to one tradition, a Taoist deity,
    etc..)

This process of deification of extraordinary mortals is quite
concordantto my hindu self which daily adoresits pitR-s/ ancestors and
historical heroes (esp. shivAjI, hammIra and rAjasimha)through rites
and mantra-s. But, I had not foundan adequate expression of this
phenomenon in hindu thought, until I read Dr. G L Krishna’s appendix
E[here](http://www.sandeepweb.com/the-bhagavad-gita-before-the-battle/).

kRShNa says in the bhagavad-gItA : “यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं
श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा । तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ॥ ४१ ॥” – “All
that is endowed withglory, grace, grandeur,has sprung froma mere
flare of my radiance”

-   To paraphrase GL kRShNa: The adoration of awesomeness includes
    adoration of glorious characters in our legends, the celebration of
    natural geography (the great rivers, the great mountains, etc. as
    centres of pilgrimage) and the adoration of sages (from
    Vyasa-Vishwamitra to Ramana-Ramakrishna).

The benefits of this are obvious, and I’ve considered them in detail
elsewhere. But it reminds me of the sage of mAnasatarangiNI quoting
socrates, and rjrasva@ quoting a bAlinese hindu on the topic:

-   Socrates on the use of myth
    [here](https://storify.com/EPButler/on-plato-phaedrus-229b-230a): “I
    accept what is customarily believed concerning them, and, as I was
    saying, I look not into them but into my own self: Am I a beast more
    complicated and savage than Typhon, or am I a tamer, simpler animal
    with a share in a divine and gentle nature?”.
-   In[this
    conversation](http://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/german-christian-in-dialogue-with-balinese-on-ramayanas-historicity/)between
    a bAlinese hindu and a German christian about the historicity of
    rAMa, the pestered hindu asks: “Do you want to know whether the
    story is true, or merely whether it occurred?”\[Orientalism and
    Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and “The Mystic East” By
    Richard King, pp. 39-40\].
-   The high priest of Ásatrúarfélagið, the norse temple :“I don’t
    believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a
    horse with eight feet,” Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, told Reuters. “We see
    the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of
    nature and human psychology.” …The priest said the gods are viewed
    as mystical and symbolic. Most modern worshipers don’t consider them
    to be living beings that are capable of flying down from the clouds.
    …The Asatru religion might describe itself as poetic–but if some
    Christians, especially those in the Western hemisphere, were to take
    a literal look at the new altar to pagan gods they might consider it
    satanic.([DailyBeast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/05/why-iceland-is-building-a-temple-to-its-pagan-gods.html))

Well, Guan Yu/ varuNa was kind to me that day – the Hispanictech (who
identified the statue upon asking) allowed me to take my car home and
return with my wallet.
