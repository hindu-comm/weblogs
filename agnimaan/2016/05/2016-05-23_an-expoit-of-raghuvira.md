An expoit of raghuvIra

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghu_Vira> was a great scholar. Reading
the below, it is no wonder
that<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokesh_Chandra> is his son.

=====================Begin excerpt===============  
Do you know raghuviraâ€™s story  
He was in pre partition TSP  
Tsp ?  
Terrorist state of porkistan  
Ok  
He knew population exchange was coming. So he sent all his family to
mainland bharat ahead of time  
They had land and property  
He didnâ€™t want to abandon those just like that  
So wanted to see which direction wind blew  
He stockpiled weapons. Rifles, pistols  
Etc  
Oh.. !!  
So the indologist raghuvira had a James Bond in him  
ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€  
Sullas came to his neighborhood  
But didnâ€™t expect he was prepared  
Before abandoning his property for good, he wanted to inflict as much
damage as possible  
His house got surrounded  
He loaded up with pistols and rifles, escaped from the house  
Shot his way through the border and escaped to india  
Iâ€™m only grateful for his editorial work of jaiminiya brahmana  
For this heroic deed, he is my personal hero
