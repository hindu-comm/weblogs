Japanese blood-debt and other Hindu connections



Consider [this
article](http://www.greenshinto.com/wp/2016/05/26/abes-political-agenda-g7/)(via
rjrasva@). There are several interesting aspects to it.

# Japan paid the blood-price

It is heartening to note the below excerpt:

‚ÄúMany of the Shinto association‚Äôs aims overlap with those of another
increasingly influential group, Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference), whose
38,000 members, including Abe and most of his cabinet, believe that
Japan ‚Äúliberated‚Äù Asia from Western colonial powers, and that the
postwar constitution has emasculated the country‚Äôs ‚Äútrue, original
characteristics‚Äù.

‚Äú



Yes, Japan ‚Äúliberated‚Äù Asia, including India. The British would not have
left but for the enormous blood price paid by our Japanese brothers. It
is a pity that most Hindu-s do not understand this. Here, it is
gratifying to note that this is not a mere figment of our (ie. Japan
admiring Hindu) imagination ‚Äì it is also the self image of the Shinto
elite. My deepest respects to them üôèüôèüôè.



## Ancilliary matters

\* To be fully liberated, the sage of MT says that it is almost certain
that Hindu-swill have to pay a similarly enormous price. It is a
different matter as to whether we are already dead and it‚Äôs just the
corpse that is rotting.

# Indologist ‚Äì Japanologistsimilitude

Analogous to White ‚Äúhindu-s‚Äù lecturing to us about what ‚Äúhinduism really
is, and how hindutva is not hinduism‚Äù, thisJohn guyfancies that his
‚Äúgreen shiNTo‚Äù is **the** shiNTo, and that the old shiNTo of the
nativesis evil.

Furthermore, it quotes:

This guys is an example of a first class traitor. A friend rightly
notes: ‚Äúi suspect this Koichi Nakano to be a preta or a leftist, sophia
university is a catholic uni‚Äù.The analogy with Indian sickulars is too
obvious to note explicitly.
