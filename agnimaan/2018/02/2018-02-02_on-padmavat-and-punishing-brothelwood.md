On padmAvat and punishing brothelwood

I haven’t seen the controversial padmAvat. I hear that it is a box
office hit. It is no surprise that most people are idiots and/ or
shameless in their adharma (which includes encouraging asat-kAvya).
Since I endeavor not to belong to that category to the best of my
abilities, I won’t pay to see the movie – though I might see it without
paying sometime down the line – partly in order to study the enemy.
Neither will I let my family be dragged into that cesspool (राजा
राष्ट्रकृतं भुङ्क्ते राज्ञः पापं पुरोहितः। भर्ता च स्त्रीकृतं पापं
शिष्यपापं गुरुस्तथा।। ).

What are the objections to padmAvat?

-   “Padmavat movie depicts something not even in Malik Muhammad
    Jayasi’s original work – that the root cause of the invasion of
    Chittor was that the Brahmin purohit rAghava defected after he was
    caught being a sex pervert (peeping tom). In vengeance, he induces
    Alauddin to invade to capture Padmini.” –

    Jayasi’s work blamed a black-magic performing musician instead –

    (“Evil Brahmin cause of Hindu suffering”. Such negative presentation
    – albeit muted- is familiar from “Baji Rao Mastani” depiction of
    conservative brAhmaNa-s and bAji’s mother.)
-   Fictional Muslim characters like Mehrunnisa and Khan are fabricated
    to show Muslims in good light. These characters are found neither in
    epic nor in history.
-   rAjaputra-s object to their revered queen being depicted in
    inappropriate behavior (a dance before men). Most others might not
    object, but I can sympathize. Would I want my mother or grandmother
    thus depicted? (No, our clan and the broader varNa have no tradition
    of social dances by women – unlike say the gujju-s.)
