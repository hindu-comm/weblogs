Kalavai, Chinese man and a white racist

Reproduced from :



> I encountered a racist on the flight from Hong Kong to San Francisco.
> On a flight, if I am not sleeping or reading, I try to stretch myself
> near the exit rows. In the row behind the exit row were a Chinese
> woman and an obese white dude on the two aisle seats and a Chinese guy
> in the middle seat. I had been talking to the Chinese guy while we
> were waiting to board. He is a math professor and a soft-spoken man.
>
> The Chinese man wanted to go to the toilet and requested the white
> dude, “Excuse me sir. Mind if I could request you to get up so I can
> go the toilet?”
>
> The white dude replied, quite abrasively, “No. Go through the other
> side.”
>
> The Chinese man was still polite, “Sir, that lady is asleep. That is
> why I am not disturbing her.”
>
> The white dude made no attempt to conceal his racism this time, “F\*@#
> off. I am not getting up. Why don’t you people fly some low cost
> Chinese airline?”
>
> Much to my surprise, the Chinese man was still polite, “Sir, please
> don’t use the F word. It is rude. You needn’t get up. Can I step
> over?”
>
> The white dude was even more belligerent this time, “Make sure your
> shoes don’t touch me unless you want to get spanked.”
>
> Everybody seated around heard the conversation and were evidently
> disgusted. The Chinese man very carefully stepped over. I walked with
> him to the back of the aircraft, poured a can of coke into a cup and
> handed it over to him: “When you get back to the seat, just pour this
> on that racist’s crotch. The trousers as well as the seat would be
> soaked wet. He would not only have to get up but would also have the
> most inconvenient flight for another 10 hours.” It was a packed flight
> so there was opportunity to change seats.
>
> Our Chinese friend was still too polite, “But would it not be rude?
> Can I just threaten him instead?” I nodded.
>
> We walked back to the row and the Chinese man requested the racist
> dude, “Please get up and let me in.”
>
> The racist dude replied, “No. F\*@# off. Come from the other side.”
>
> Now, the Chinese man was well prepared, “I am not giving you an
> option. I am just warning you. I have the right to enter the row from
> your side. I will count three and pour this coke on your crotch. You
> will have the most inconvenient flight for another 10 hours.”
>
> The racist dude didn’t expect this. Nor those seated around. He
> tentatively asked, “What if I returned the favor?”
>
> “Well, I won’t mind. After all, we are supposed to fly budget Chinese
> airlines. But I prefer not to carry out the threat because I am a
> product of a 5,000 year-old civilization,” replied the Chinese man.
>
> The racist got up and the Chinese man got in. The passengers seated
> around applauded.
>
> Moral #1 of the story: Civilized behavior and observing restraint work
> when the caveat of unpleasant reprisal is real.
>
> Moral #2 of the story: It is time Asians, Africans, and South
> Americans stopped paying obscene amounts of money to far less
> qualified white expats. When a white expat is paid more than a Chinese
> dude in Hong Kong with similar skills it simply reinforces the sense
> of entitlement. Every time the flight crew instinctively feels it
> should smile more politely to a white person, it reinforces the sense
> of entitlement.
