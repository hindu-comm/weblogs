kalavai’s response to christian “love”.

The below, which forms a good template for how to uncompromisingly
resist zombie cults, is reproduced from :

> A Christian fanatic has the audacity to ask me via message, “How can
> you ridicule a missionary who has just lost his life? Have you no
> empathy?”
>
> I replied:

> \[Quote\]  
> The American missionary who illegally entered Sentinel Island and got
> killed should be treated as a homicidal criminal. The Sentinelese have
> been cut off from other populations for 60,000 years. This means they
> have no immunity even to pathogens which cause common cold. His mere

> Sentinelese population.  
> I would treat this as premeditated murder. Your missionary criminal
> was an American. In America, everyone knows about immunization and the

> I have no sympathy for the criminal. Ridicule is what he deserves. The

The missionary who was killed was in fact initially angrily warned off
one day, before being killed, according to [this news
report](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/family-u-s-missionary-john-chau-we-forgive-tribe-killing-n939276):

> The American went ashore in his kayak on Nov. 15 and sent the boat

> He interacted with some of the tribespeople, offering gifts such as a
> football and fish. But the tribespeople became angry and shot an arrow
> at him, hitting a book he was carrying.
>
> Chau swam back to the fishermen’s boat and for the night and set out
> again to meet the tribespeople on Nov. 16.  
> On Nov. 17, the waiting fishermen watched from a distance as the
> tribesmen dragged Chau’s body.

The Sentalese (or more likely their neighbors) had rough encounters with
a English pervert in the late 1800s
([TW](https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1065841141201989632)),
which possibly (and luckily) increased their desire for isolation.
