Personal choice, love jihAd: an exchange

I excerpt a private exchange covering the following topics:

-   Love jihAd
-   Personal choice

P1 says:

> Why can’t Hindu boys wage a Dharmayuddha and convert Muslim/Christian
> girls to Hindu’s? I am tired of all these love jihad stories where
> Hindu girls accept Islam lured by Muslims?
>
> ………
>
> Was kidding!! But it occurred to me that this sound and noise behind
> love jihad is nothing but a manifestation of the fact that men
> consider women to be their property. A property, which needs their
> protection.
>
> This protectionism also serves as a mask to tell the women “You are
> not competent enough” of choosing your life partner or your career.
> Often this protectionism come to us subconsciously.
>
> If you add religion to this feeling, it becomes a deadly combination
> of righteousness and vigilantism. Can’t you trust women of your own
> family (or religion) to take a right decision? Even a casual
> observation, of how your own mother/sister manages the household,
> relations and societal expectations with grace is an indicator that
> they are worthy of that#trust.

P2 responds:

> It is true that love jihaad is more prevalent than the reverse –
> because hindus are generally less enthusiastic about spreading their
> religion to others and are more interested in securing their limited
> place on earth for posterity; but also because the reaction of muslims
> is generally far more brutal (think getting hacked to death). That
> should not be taken to mean that the hindus are whiny loosers and that
> the reverse does not happen. I know a person who helped his lovestruck
> braahmaNa friend elope with a muslim while they were (on their own)
> across the PoK in early 90-s; and have heard many second hand cases
> over the years. We find many such famous cases in history.
>
> Regarding the ability of women (and more generally young people) to
> make wise choices with regards to marriage – while it is roughly true
> that men today are about as much uneducated idiots as women when it
> comes to their knowledge of the letter and spirit of the
> dharma-shAstra-s, where this is/ was not the case, it is natural that
> such “trust” would be misplaced. Further, even when the letter of
> shAstra-s is unknown, the particular preferences and practices of past
> generations are well taken seriously and adhered to for those
> interested in harmony in their clan and society – since they would
> usually embody the spirit of dharmashaastra and have the advantage of
> passing the “Lindy test” (ref NN Taleb). We have lived with muslims
> for 1k years, and it is reasonable to take the rules that have emerged
> from this co-existence seriously.

P1:

> I will need to read again. Men and women are free to roam around with
> whomsoever is my point. Too much of snooping in personal matters are
> happening. First it was food and now it’s this

P2:

> At what level should there be autonomy? At the individual level? Or at
> the level of family? Or at the level of super-family? Or at the level
> of caste? Or at the state level? Or at the national level? (In any
> given axis – say food, marriage etc..) The choice of one negates
> choice of other.
>
> If one says that the autonomy is at the level of family (the answers
> could be different according to different people), then it implies the
> following:  
> – Superstructures such as super-family, caste , state and nation have
> no jurisdiction in such a family affair.  
> – Family’s preferences override (and potentially suppress) the
> individual whims.
>
> The point of this is to state that “snooping in personal matters” is
> not an obviously inferior setup or situation, though individualism
> fanatics might present it as such.
>
> Teen marriage is a case where I would, for example, defang the
> overreach of the sickular Indian state. It should be up to the
> families involved (as is the case in USA).
>
> Speaking of cult control, it might be a good idea to give some “equal
> time” for phenomena such as these (from KV):
>
> “I was recently talking to a friend from one of the northeastern
> states in India. I will not divulge his/her identity for security
> reasons. He/she informed me how minutely the Christian churches
> control the lives of the faithful flock. Every student that attends
> the schools must undergo several years of religious studies and pass
> an exam in Christian theology. Only then would the student receive the
> hall ticket to sit in a board exam. This friend had recently visited a
> village during Christmas. It was festive occasion and people were
> tempted to laugh out loud and indulge in banter inside the house.
> However, every few minutes, someone would express fear of the shepherd
> and everyone would start speaking in hushed voices. Yes, every church
> has a set of pastors and each pastor has shepherds. This shepherd
> would patrol the streets and control even minute aspects such as
> someone talking loud.
>
> This kind of mind-control and abuse of the congregation happens
> everywhere in India. Only the expressions vary. A Christian family
> must get the approval of the pastor should they decide to go on a tour
> on a Sunday rather than attend the church. A Christian student cannot
> get school or college admission unless the pastor writes a letter of
> recommendation. Even during natural calamities such as floods, one
> could see that the pastors stand by the faithful and control what they
> say.”

P1:

> All religions shamelessly do this.Methods are different.

P2:

> Borrowing the idea from a sanskrit subhAShita-  
> All birds (say crow and koel) do the same. Voices are different. 🙂
>
> An impromptu kannada prose translation of that memorable original:  
> ಕಾಗೆ ಕಪ್ಪು ಕೋಗಿಲೆ ಕಪ್ಪು, ಕಪ್ಪೇ ಕಪ್ಪು ಏನ್ ಭೇದ?  
> ವಸನ್ತಕಾಲ ಬನ್ದಾಗ ಕಾಗೆ ಕಾಗೆ, ಕೋಗಿಲೆ ಕೋಗಿಲೆ.
>
> In any case, my point was not to distinguish hinduism for its recent
> (sad) incompetence at gripping and marshalling its adherents relative
> to Abe’s diseases – it was rather to point out that people
> (intelkshuals especially) are generally unaware of or willingly blind
> to such devilry (unlike the obvious soft target – the “known devil”).
> Such secularism is not really neutral, but quite partial – like
> shikhaNDin providing cover for arjuna when faced with bhIShma.
