“khaNDita” and “decisiveness”

viShNu moDUr [asked on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SoliloqVish/status/1070655391820865536) :
“Khandita- “खंडित” in Hindi is someone who is broken, destroyed or
split. Khandita Nayika is a type of female protagonist in Bharatanatyam.
However, the same Khandita in Kannada “ಖಂಡಿತ” is decisive, definite and
sure. How is this? Does the Sanskrit root of this word have any clue?”

the question to the general informed public.An intuitive solution
follows.

The usage is quite intuitive and idiomatic – When you pronounce a firm
decision, you \*cut off\* other possibilities. When I say I will
definitely send X money tomorrow, I am cutting off the possibility of
prevaricating to X. In fact, the word “decision” carries a very [similar
connotation](https://think-legacy.com/2013/10/14/root-word-decision/?fbclid=IwAR17FEM0Clibz7_blbcmbEFPlKseqVHFCWFYl_P2k17xn-IK5aP020R5dL0)!
(same root as incision for example). Also compare with avashyavAgi or
avashyam.
