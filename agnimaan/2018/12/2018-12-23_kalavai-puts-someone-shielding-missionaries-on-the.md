Kalavai puts someone shielding missionaries on the spot

> Every time you bring up the factual reality of widespread Christian
> proselytism, the first-responders who deny that reality are
> westernized Hindus. One such Hindu woman vehemently argued with me
> over the phone. Here is the conversation:

> She: “I went to a Catholic school. But nobody tried to convert me.”
>
> I replied:
>
> “Have you heard
> of[#MeToo](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/metoo?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG)?
> Let us take the hypothetical example of a lyricist who is accused of
> abusing many aspiring female singers. He obviously doesn’t target
> every single woman he comes into contact with. He targets the most
> vulnerable. The reason is simple. There is a cost associated with
> sexual predation. Why waste time and effort on someone who would
> repulse his move? So, it is only to be expected that he would not
> target such persons and instead go after those who are vulnerable.
> Now, a woman who argues that the predator is not guilty just because
> he didn’t target her is erring on 3 counts:
>
> 1.) She is doing a disservice to those who were his victims.
>
> 2.) She is mistakenly portraying her personal experience as the
> experiences of everyone else without looking into the circumstances
> which made them vulnerable.
>
> 3.) She is effectively shielding the sexual predator.
>
> Your behavior is similar. Missionaries didn’t attempt to overtly
> convert you because they knew that would require more effort.
> Missionaries have finite amount of money and time at their disposal.
> So as calculative persons, they would target more vulnerable persons
> for proselytism. However, they have covertly converted you in many
> ways especially by co-opting you. You most likely recited Lord’s
> Prayer in daily assembly and didn’t wear bindi or flowers to school –
> which Christianity forbids. You obeyed their diktats. You have become
> sympathetic to the missionaries instead of viewing them as predators.
> You even act as a first responder whenever the topic of proselytism is
> brought up. Missionaries would love that. They’ve succeeded in getting
> you to fight their battle.
>
> Busybody memes (a.k.a. first responders) like you who deny that
> missionaries proselytize are in no way different from those who
> exonerate sexual predators.”
