A pedagogical note on myths.

Even as many simple minded people take tales of myths such as devAsura
battles literally and historically, andtry to “prove” all sorts of
ridiculous things, others are driven to stupefied silence or shame by
the mockery of
[IYI](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577)-s.

The solution, in either case, is to:

-   first understand that the myths are not to be taken literally.
    -   The veda itself lays it out in no uncertain terms (शतपथब्राहणे
        ११.१.६,[external
        source](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/kalpa/brAhmaNa/shatapatha_asura_parAbhava.html))
        ;
    -   and so do later AchArya-s like shankara (अथवा न देवाः असुरा वा
        अन्ये केचन विद्यन्ते मनुष्येभ्यः ; मनुष्याणामेव अदान्ताः ये
        अन्यैरुत्तमैर्गुणैः सम्पन्नाः ; ते देवाः ; लोभप्रधाना मनुष्याः ;
        तथा हिंसापराः क्रूरा असुराः ; ते एव मनुष्याः
        अदान्तत्वादिदोषत्रयमपेक्ष्य देवादिशब्दभाजो भवन्ति।)
    -   rangapriya svAmI ( [kannada
        lectures](https://archive.org/details/bhAratIya-habba-AcharaNegaLu-rangapriya-swamy)
        ) .
    -   The great roman AchArya Sallustius offers [further
        insights](https://hindutva.github.io/main/tattvam/deva/sallustius.html).
-   Secondly, one must understand that they myths are “true” and
    extremely valuable despite not having occured in space and time
    because, being of divine origin themselves, they tell us how the
    deva-s are to be skilfully approached, visualized and adored for our
    own benefit (besides yielding all sort of deeper AdhyAtmika
    interpretations).
