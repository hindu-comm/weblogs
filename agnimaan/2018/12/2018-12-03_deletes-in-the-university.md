Deletes in the university

The below witty (unverified) summary is reproduced from
<https://www.facebook.com/shrivathsa.brahma/posts/578059752632220%C2%A0>
, please see later links before making up your mind about this
particular case:

> Whither academic honesty in an environment of political correctness.
>
> 1\. A delete gets a professorship position in a national institute.  
> 2. The delete could not defend a talk and accuses some professors of
> humiliating him. I was a student in a national inst. and we were
> routinely “humiliated”. But then this person is a delete so, people
> have a special grudge and this is harassment!!! If you cannot defend a
> talk, you are not fit to be even a student. You are a prof for God’s
> sake!  
> 3. The delete whines to the chairman that he is harassed but he
> doesn’t mention caste harassment.  
> 4. The enquiry finds harassment.  
> 5. A mail surfaces where the delete prof is accused of plagiarism in
> his phd thesis. It is now that it dawns on the prof that he is a
> delete and he decides to use the nuclear option. The atrocities
> ordinance. Four profs are arrested.  
> 6. It is a general practice that the phd theses of natl institutes are
> put up online. I searched to the best of my ability but didn’t find
> it. Therefore it is not possible to verify whether the accusations of
> plagiarism are indeed true. That it is not available online makes for
> something smelling bad.
>
> This is the death warrant of research in India. Any reservation
> candidate can claim harassment even when academic questions are posed
> to him. Jaibeem comrades!

Summary from one side: “HoD AK Ghosh and Manindra Agrawal turned the
case of nepotism being called over into that of a harassment.”
