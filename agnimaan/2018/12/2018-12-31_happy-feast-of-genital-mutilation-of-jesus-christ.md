Happy Feast of Genital Mutilation of Jesus Christ

The below is reproduced from:

> Happy Christian New Year to all my Christian friends. Hope you all
> have a great Feast of Genital Mutilation of Jesus Christ on January
> 1st. May you be blessed with darshan of Holy Foreskin of Jesus
> Christ’s Holy Penis this lifetime.

> Dear Hindu friends, please know the history behind why Jan 1st is
> celebrated as a New Year Day by Christian British (and thus us
> colonized Indians) before you wish any one else a Happy New Year.
>
> Here, read Wikipedia: “When William the Conqueror took over the reins
> of England, he ordered that 1st January be established as the New Year
> to collaborate it with his coronation and with the circumcision of
> Jesus (on the eighth day from his alleged birth on December 25).
> However, this was abandoned later as they joined the rest of the
> Christian world to celebrate New Year on 25 March. In 1582, Pope
> Gregory XIII while reforming the Julian calendar established 1 January
> as the beginning of a New Year of the Gregorian calendar.”
>
> When Galileo discovered the rings around Saturn using his telescope,
> there were several theories. But the one by the Church was the best —
> that Saturn’s rings came from the penis foreskin of Jesus which
> ascended to Saturn while Jesus was ascending to Heaven with his body —
> “Allatius was the keeper of the Vatican library, and in De Praeputio
> Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba (Discussion concerning the Prepuce
> \[holy foreskin\] of our Lord Jesus Christ) he proposed that, as Jesus
> ascended, he left a bit of himself in the heavens: “the holy foreskin
> may have ascended into heaven at the same time as Jesus himself, and
> might have become the rings of Saturn.”
>
> So don’t be silly and wish others Happy New Year — that’s on Ugadi day
> in March/April. Wish them Happy Feast of Genital Mutilation of Jesus
> Christ.
