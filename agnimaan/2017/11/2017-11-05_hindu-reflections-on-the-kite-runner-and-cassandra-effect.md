Hindu reflections on “The kite runner” and cassandra effect

I half wish I hadn’t seen “kite runner”
\[[GS](https://gostream.is/film/the-kite-runner-12463/watching.html?ep=740678)\].
hazAra-s reduced to such a state by the bachChAbaazi bastards (what to
speak of the recently converted cousins of the kalAsha)… A good reminder
that Islamification will imply a fall for our bloodline’s long term
prospects.

It’s always bad to be the “last holdout” or the “most fresh convert”
(Think of kAshmIra-paNDita-s or kalasha or nUristAni-s). Our strategy
should change with time – we should always try to get the greatest power
and influence – for now, it means preparing for the time when most of
our fellows (or what remains of them) finally become awake – To exactly
avoid the destiny when we are reduced to agreeing that the best we can
do is be the most influential dhimmi-s in some not-too-unfriendly rAxasa
state (or worse – crypto-convert or really convert). But, I am not clear
if the cotton-heads will fall in line in time. 🙁

In more general terms, this is a problem of a prescient minority
watching relatively helplessly as a dumb majority continues to compound
a folly (a generalization of the classic [Cassandra
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_(metaphor))). What
should the **attitude of the prescient** be? It is easy to be frustrated
and gloomy; but there’s something better –

-   Above all: As baby-rearing guides say: **BE CALM BUT FIRM.** As NNT
    [would
    say](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15)**:
    Be a very stubborn minority.**
-   Try to **increase or at least maintain the power (and number) of
    prescient ones** in the meantime – it is a fact of nature that the
    majority will always be rather dumb in such matters. Change
    locations, professions etc.. as necessary.
    -   Be **aware and prepared for unexpected opportunities** (which
        Indian knew that the noble uShasputra-s would sacrifice so much
        blood to free Asia, including India?) to restore dominance.
-   Till one can restore the natural order of things, **accept the
    dumbocracy as a facet of perturbed nature**, much as the
    uShasputra-s accept and adjust to their lives in a tectonically
    hyperactive region.
