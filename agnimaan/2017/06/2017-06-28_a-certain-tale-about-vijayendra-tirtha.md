A certain tale about vijayendra-tIrtha

(via shrI pAnchajanya)

Actually aft vijayanagara lost in talikota  
Local Muslim cantonment of kumbakonam which was under vijayanagara
revolted  
As people knew that it would take ragunatha nayaka a day to reach
kumbakonam from thanjavur aft gathering his forces  
They approached vijayendra for help in order to protect the temples  
Vijayendra asked representatives from each temple at the town to bring
him a bag of coconuts  
And on doing so he did a prayoga on the coconuts and asked people to
break it when the sulla army approached the temple  
As he said when people broke those coconuts broke each and every temple
on being invaded by the sulla army they heard the sound of a no of lions
roaring simultaneously  
Hearing which they were frightened and ran away  
Thus the temples were protected and the Sullas were butchered by
ragunatha nayaka the next day  
So as a mark of respect each and every temple which was present at that
time (irrespective of whether it is vishnu, Shiva or Devi) sends it
prasada to vijayendra on his aradhane  
Which is the day on which he entered brindavana
