On hindu consumer choices.

A response to what ispresented in[this
video:](https://youtu.be/ETAZU8pAk9Q)



Very true that rAmadeva bAbA is intent on making loads of money (like a
businessman) through patanjali products, and that most of them are not
“fully Ayurvedic”. I even think that this is a well known fact, and that
his buyers are not the fools needing a lecture. Given a choice, though,
I would go for patanjali product since the profits will be used for the
advancement of dhArmika socio-political causes (atleast relative to
other alternatives).

I would even argue that for similar reasons, one should refuse to buy
goods and services from communities and concerns (ultimately) intent on
destroying our civilization and culture (which from their perspective
are backward, superstitious and stupid). So, I choose my airlines,
grocers etc.. with some care in this regard.
