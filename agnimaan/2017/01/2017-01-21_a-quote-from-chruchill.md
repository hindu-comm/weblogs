A quote from Churchill

Thenotorious British fatso drunkard[wrote a
speech](http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/our-duty-in-india)in
1931, of which I’ve highlighted a few sentences for your quasi-amused
notice:

> But that is not all. To abandon India to the rule of the Brahmins
> would be an act of cruel and wicked negligence. It would shame for
> ever those who bore its guilt. These Brahmins who mouth and patter the
> principles of Western Liberalism, and pose as philosophic and
> democratic politicians, are the same Brahmins who deny the primary
> rights of existence to nearly sixty millions of their own fellow
> countrymen whom they call ‘untouchable’, and whom they have by
> thousands of years of oppression actually taught to accept this sad
> position. **They will not eat with these sixty millions, nor drink
> with them, nor treat them as human beings. They consider themselves
> contaminated even by their approach. And then in a moment they turn
> round and begin chopping logic** with John Stuart Mill, or pleading
> the rights of man with Jean Jacques Rousseau.
>
> While any community, social or religious, endorses such practices and
> asserts itself resolved to keep sixty millions of fellow countrymen
> perpetually and eternally in a state of sub-human bondage, we cannot
> recognise their claim to the title-deeds of democracy. Still less can
> we hand over to their unfettered sway those helpless millions they
> despise. Side by side with this Brahmin theocracy and the immense
> Hindu population – angelic and untouchable castes alike – there dwell
> in India seventy millions of Moslems, a race of far greater physical
> vigour and fierceness, armed with a religion which lends itself only
> too readily to war and conquest. **While the Hindu elaborates his
> argument, the Moslem sharpens his sword.** Between these two races and
> creeds, containing as they do so many gifted arid charming beings in
> all the glory of youth, there is no intermarriage.
>
> The gulf is impassable. If you took the antagonisms of France and
> Germany, and the antagonisms of Catholics and Protestants, and
> compounded them and multiplied them ten-fold, you would not equal the
> division which separates these two races intermingled by scores of
> millions in the cities and plains of India. But over both of them the
> impartial rule of Britain has hitherto lifted its appeasing sceptre.
> Until the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms began to raise the question of
> local sovereignty and domination, they had got used to dwelling side
> by side in comparative toleration. But step by step, as it is believed
> we are going to clear out or be thrust out of India, so this
> tremendous rivalry and hatred of races springs into life again. It is
> becoming more acute every day. Were we to wash our hands of all
> responsibility and divest ourselves of all our powers, as our
> sentimentalists desire, ferocious civil wars would speedily break out
> between the Moslems and the Hindus. No one who knows India will
> dispute this.
>
> But that is not the end. **The Brahmins know well that they cannot
> defend themselves against the Moslems. The Hindus do not possess among
> their many virtues that of being a fighting race. The whole south of
> India is peopled with races deserving all earnest solicitude and
> regard, but incapable of self-defence.** It is in the north alone that
> the fighting races dwell. Bengal, for instance, does not send from her
> forty-five million inhabitants any soldiers to the native army. The
> Punjab is a place where fighting races dwell\|, on the other hand, and
> the Pathans, together with the Ghurkas and the Sikhs, who are entirely
> exceptional sects of Hindus, all dwelling in the north, furnish
> three-quarters of the entire army in the time of peace, and furnished
> more than three-quarters of it in time of war. There can be no doubt
> therefore that the departure of the British from India, which Mr.
> Gandhi advocates, and which Mr. Nehru demands, would be followed first
> by a struggle in the North and thereafter by a reconquest of the South
> by the North, and of the Hindus by the Moslems.
>
> This danger has not escaped the crafty foresight of the Brahmins. It
> is for that reason that they wish to have the control of a British
> army, or failing that, a white army of janissaries officered, as Mr.
> Gandhi has suggested, by Germans or other Europeans. They wish to have
> an effective foreign army, or foreign-organised army, in order to
> preserve their dominance over the Moslems and their tyranny over their
> own untouchables. There, is the open plot of which we are in danger of
> becoming the dupes, and the luckless millions of Indians the victims.
>
> It is our duty to guard those millions from that fate.
