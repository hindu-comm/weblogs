The tale of the two classes of vaNij-s | mAnasa-taraMgiNI

> It struck us that the Fijian venture of the Hindus had floundered
> because they had completely neglected the use of arms and organizing a
> fighting force. Instead they had only concentrated on the activities
> of the vaNij. All their economic success was of no use because even a
> recently civilized tribal population, which was much more attuned to
> war, was able to easily overthrow them.
