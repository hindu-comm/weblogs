> Carnatic music, vina and Bharatanatyam are part of Tamil identity. The
> intent to preserve that remains strong. But once they have the
> arangetram, the final ceremony, they do not perform it ever again. The
> moment it is finished, they quit dancing. For me, that is
> heartbreaking.Obviously, the life of a professional dancer/teacher is
> not for everyone—maybe just for five percent. One may get married,
> have a baby and have family duties to perform. Even then, dance should
> at least continue as personal sadhana. But that is not done.
