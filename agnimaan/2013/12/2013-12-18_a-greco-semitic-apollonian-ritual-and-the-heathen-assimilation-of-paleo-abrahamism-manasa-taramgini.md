A Greco-Semitic Apollonian ritual and the heathen assimilation of paleo-Abrahamism | mAnasa-taraMgiNI

> Then he looked up at us and said: “I guess you do not follow any of
> this religion. Indeed, our padre had said how difficult it was to
> convert Hindus and he was happy to leave India and come over to
> Botswana. The padre said that he had best success in India with
> urbanized students of pretavAdin schools or tribals/lower strata of
> society but even that totally ‘sucked’. The former never came to
> church again to hear more of the good news; the latter soon placed the
> preta as one among their many gods with various animal faces. Soon a
> Hindu priest would come and ask them to remove Jesus and with that all
> the pretavAda was gone.”
