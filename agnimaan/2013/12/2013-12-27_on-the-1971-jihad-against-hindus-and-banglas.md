On the 1971 jihad against hindus and banglas

> “I saw Hindus, hunted from village to village and door to door, shot
> off-hand after a cursory ‘short-arm inspection’ showed they were
> uncircumcised. I have heard the screams of men bludgeoned to death in
> the compound of the Circuit House (civil administrative headquarters)
> in Comilla. I have seen truckloads of other human targets and those
> who had the humanity to try to help them hauled off ‘for disposal’
> under the cover of darkness and curfew.”
