China’s nuke stance towards India

> Outstanding disputes such as the one over the Switzerland-sized area
> of Arunachal Pradesh continue to bedevil relations. China’s
> militarisation of the Tibetan plateau — including placing a third of
> its nuclear arsenal in that region — is a direct challenge to Indian
> sensibilities. Indeed, India is the only country not formally covered
> by China’s ‘no first use’ nuclear policy.
