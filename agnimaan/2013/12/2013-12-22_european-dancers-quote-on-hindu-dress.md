European dancer’s quote on hindu dress.

> When a lady wears a sari and bindi, there is no confusion about her
> identity. Clearly, she is a Hindu and she is an Indian. Once you stop
> wearing sari or stop performing classical dance of India we do not
> know who you are anymore. You can be anyone or no one. Your identity
> in that case is not just questionable, it is lost. I am not against
> wearing this style or that style of dress. I am just saying that
> traditional dress reveals and preserves the identity of a person.
