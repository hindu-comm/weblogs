Non-spoiler review of Life of Pi. 4/4.

Stupendous climax despite hard-to-stand (for those like me) start. Rich
in visual beauty.  
Reaffirms the role of religous myth in understanding nature, human
nature and hope (after abstracting away gory bloody lesser facts by
allegory).  
The hero, that crafted such a deep, imaginatively rich allegory, HAD to
be a hindu. Few other (extant, major) culture can easily produce an
equivalent.
