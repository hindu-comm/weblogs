Kalavai venkat, Islam, racists and leftists



The below is from the linked post:

> A few months ago, I had written something to the effect: 
> 
> \[Quote – not
> verbatim\] Nobody says, “I oppose racism but I welcome racists.”
> Everyone understands that if racism is terrible then racists are to be
> shunned. However, even those who are critical of Islam say, “I am
> critical of Islam but I welcome Muslims.” Somehow, the moment a
> hateful ideology which spreads the worst forms of bigotry is packaged
> as religion critics begin to pull punches. I would rather take a
> principled stance, “I condemn Islam and I welcome ex-Muslims.”
> \[Unquote\]
> 
> That post got circulated and eventually reached a leftist
> American academic. He interacts with me once in a few months. His tone
> is generally hostile toward me. I respond with jibes and sarcasm. It
> was no different this time. He wrote, “You just equated 1.8 billion
> Muslims with racists. Your prejudice-filled mind didn’t even consider
> the possibility that you were offending Muslims, did it?” I replied,
> “It is the racists who should feel offended by what I had written. In
> the bygone centuries, racists did quote the Bible for defense. No
> longer the case. Today, very few racists insist that their bigotry has
> a divine mandate. That means anyone could freely condemn racism. A
> racist belief is not protected by any institution. That means a racist
> is all by himself and is a vanishing breed. In contrast, a Muslim
> believes that his bigotry has a divine mandate. Virtually all
> institutions protect Islam even though it is a repository of bigotry.
> In other words both Islam and Muslims enjoy institutional protection.
> So, a racist may be justified in taking offense that I equated an
> endangered species with a thriving and well cared for one!”
