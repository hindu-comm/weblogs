Islam as morality bringer

> Several years ago, for a few weeks, I advised a startup by a handful
> of Pakistanis in the Silicon Valley. All of them knew that I was very
> critical of Islam. One of them had begun nurturing doubts about Islam
> and would have offline conversations with me. He would subsequently
> become an apostate. However, the person who was the CEO was a Muslim
> fundamentalist. Let us call him Salim. One day Salim tried to convince
> me that I was completely mistaken in my assessment of Prophet
> Muhammad. He argued that Muhammad was a perfect human being and the
> most compassionate person. More importantly, he insisted, “It is
> because of Islam that I am a virtuous person today. But for Islam, I
> may even have become a murderer.”It’s a tediously oft-repeated
> apologetical argument from Christians and Muslims. I replied, “Salim,
> I am worried that you may murder me for my criticism of Islam
> precisely because you’re a Muslim. I would feel safer in the company
> of an apostate.”The sarcasm was lost on him but was well received by
> the other Pakistani who eventually became an apostate!PS: Before any
> of you start accusing me of collaborating with Pakistanis, please be
> informed that I was asked by a venture capitalist to evaluate and
> render tech advice to a startup the VC planned to invest in. It just
> happened that Pakistani-Americans were behind the startup. I am
> pleased to inform that the startup went bust – not because of the tech
> advice I rendered!
