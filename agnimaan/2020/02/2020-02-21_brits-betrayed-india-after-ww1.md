Brits betrayed India after WW1

From <https://rashbeharibose.art.blog/2020/02/10/greater-east-asia-war/>

> “The result of the Great European War was that the major Western
> powers even further intensified their colonization. England promised
> Indians that if they crushed Germany and helped England win the war,
> they would leave India and give them independence. Believing this,
> Indians fought desperately and provided great economic assistance.”
>
> However, after defeating Germany, England betrayed India. Far from
> leaving India, they embarked on a massive killing spree across the
> country.

From <https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33317368> :

> India was wracked by high taxation to support the war and the high
> inflation accompanying it, while the disruption of trade caused by the
> conflict led to widespread economic losses – all this while the
> country was also reeling from a raging influenza epidemic that took
> many lives. But nationalists widely understood from British statements
> that at the end of the war India would receive the Dominion Status
> hitherto reserved for the “White Commonwealth”.
>
> It was not to be. When the war ended in triumph for Britain, India was
> denied its promised reward. Instead of self-government, the British
> imposed the repressive Rowlatt Act, which vested the Viceroy’s
> government with extraordinary powers to quell “sedition” against the
> Empire by silencing and censoring the press, detaining political
> activists without trial, and arresting without a warrant any
> individuals suspected of treason against the Empire. Public protests
> against this draconian legislation were quelled ruthlessly. The worst
> incident was the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre of April 1919, when
> Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire without
> warning on 15,000 unarmed and non-violent men, women and children
> demonstrating peacefully in an enclosed garden in Amritsar, killing as
> many as 1,499 and wounding up to 1,137.
>
> With British perfidy providing such a sour ending to the narrative of
> a war in which India had given its all and been spurned in return,
> Indian nationalists felt that the country had nothing to thank its
> soldiers for. They had merely gone abroad to serve their foreign
> masters. Losing your life or limb in a foreign war fought at the
> behest of your colonial rulers was an occupational hazard – it did not
> qualify to be hailed as a form of national service.
