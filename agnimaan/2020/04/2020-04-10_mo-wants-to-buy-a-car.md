> An all time classic of this Oriya buddy is from a decade ago. He had
> advertised the sale of his rickety old Toyota Corolla in some
> classifieds. A prospective buyer called him while we were dining at my
> buddy’s place. The conversation went somewhat like this.
>
> “Hi, I am interested in buying your car.”
>
> “What’s your name? Where are you from?”
>
> “I am Muhammad. I am originally from Bangladesh but now live in the
> Silicon Valley.”
>
> “Okay Muhammad, can you get a character certificate from the local
> police?”
>
> An agitated Muhamad responds, “Why? Why should I get character
> certificate?”
>
> “See, I don’t know who you are. But I think the chances that a
> Muhammad would use the car for for suicide mission are pretty high. I
> am a family man. I don’t want to get into trouble because of some
> enthusiastic jihadi. I hope you understand my reasonable ask!”
>
> My buddy’s teenage daughter was vehemently protesting his behavior.
