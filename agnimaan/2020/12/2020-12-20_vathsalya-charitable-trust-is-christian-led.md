Vathsalya Charitable Trust is Christian led

An organization called Vathsalya Charitable Trust was in a Bengaluru
neighborhood collecting donations. I asked if they’re a christian org,
and when they said “no”, I donated. Later upon Googling (
<https://www.vctblr.org/uploads/vathsalya/anual_report_2016-2017.pdf> ,
<https://www.vctblr.org/trustees.html> ), I suspect that they are indeed
led and staffed by Christians. So, please beware.
