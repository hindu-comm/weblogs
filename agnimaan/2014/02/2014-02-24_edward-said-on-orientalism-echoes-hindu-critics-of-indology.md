Edward Said on orientalism (echoes hindu critics of Indology)

> [Edward Said – Wikipedia, the free
> encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said).
>
> As a cultural critic, academic, and writer, Said is best known for the
> book*[Orientalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book) "Orientalism (book)")*(1978),
> an analysis of the cultural representations that are the bases
> of[Orientalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism "Orientalism"),
> a term he redefined to mean the Western study of Eastern cultures and,
> in general, the framework of how The West perceives and represents The
> East.^([\[5\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said#cite_note-Ghazoul2007-5)[\[6\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said#cite_note-Gentz2009-7)[\[8\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said#cite_note-Gray2005-8))He
> contended that Orientalist scholarship was, and remains, inextricably
> tied to the imperialist societies that produced it, which makes much
> of the work inherently political, servile to power, and therefore
> intellectually suspect.

to Koenraad Elst’s article explaining that Edward Said’s thesis is
erroneous and counter-productive to hindus.
