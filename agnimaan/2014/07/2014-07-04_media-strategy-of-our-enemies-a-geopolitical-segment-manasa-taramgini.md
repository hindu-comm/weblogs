> “With the native levies shying from confrontation the mlechCha-s have
> begun using their propaganda department to continue their attack on
> bhArata. To test this one may do the simple experiment of using Google
> News US edition and change the settings so that India is on top and
> set to “always”. Then one might observe the primary India-related
> headlines in mlechCha propaganda organs. Below is a sampling of news
> items that surfaced to the top in the above experiment:  
> \*India’s rape epidemic: Will the US apply pressure for change to its
> Asian ally? Fox News  
> \*India summons US diplomat over report of NSA spying. CNN  
> \*India’s building collapse death toll reaches 60. Washington Post  
> \*’Invisible’ in India: The story of the disabled boy tied to Mumbai
> bus stop. CNN  
> \*No quick fix for India’s rape crisis. CNN  
> \*China Cultivates India Amid Tension With Neighbors. ABC News  
> \*Tiger leaps onto boat, snatches man in swamp in India. Fox News  
> \*Indian Forces Fire on Kashmir Protesters; 1 Killed. ABC News  
> \*Christians face abuse around the globe. CNN – “In India, the world’s
> largest democracy, Christians face harassment and violence, especially
> in states with laws restricting religious conversion from Hinduism.” –
> We wish truly conversion to this Abrahamistic cults was banned in
> bhArata.  
> \*Sword Fight Breaks Out at Shrine in India, Causing Injuries. ABC
> News  
> \*Indian Bureaucrats Scramble for Hindi Dictionaries. ABC News”

> What does all this mean for the Hindus? It is clear that the
> mlechCha-s want to create a deeply negative image of bhArata as a
> lawless land, which needs to be brought in line for shavasadhaka-s to
> thrive at the expense of Hindus. This is the message for their own
> people and the philo-occidental Hindu elite in India. On the other
> hand the same messages have a different utility from the angle of
> their effects on the plebeian Hindu reader. One such angle, which
> would be very apparent any discerning observer, is the attempt to
> create a strI-puruSha-bheda to disrupt Hindu social and family
> structure. Another angle is demoralizing visitors and investors to
> affect tourism and other revenues. Yet another angle is planting
> stories so as to rake up old issues irrelevant to the modern world,
> such as regionalistic linguistic chauvinism, to distract this Hindus
> from the core issues, namely removal of Abrahamistic predation on
> their lands. Earlier, a whole party was set up to rake up the issue of
> corruption which while real is hardly the biggest problem faced by
> bhArata.
