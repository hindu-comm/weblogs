A fine analysis of the late Anglo-hindu fight.

> This becomes especially relevant given the fact that the English knew
> fully well that the mainstay of the struggle against them were the
> forward caste Hindus: brAhmaNa-s and kAyastha-s forming the vanguard
> backed by kShatriya-s or functionally equivalent jAti-s, vaNija-s and
> service castes. The English elite had a deep-seated hatred against
> them, which was accentuated by their being heathens and resisting
> Christianity by virtue of their civilizational moorings. The English
> had a long tradition of allying with Islamic powers against their
> rivals, in India against the Hindus, and also against Russia and
> France. But the First war of Independence of 1857 CE had shown that
> there could be an alignment of Hindu and Mohammedan interests when it
> came to the English. Hence, they worked assiduously to cultivate
> useful Islamic forces who could act as a counterbalance against
> Hindus. In the earlier phases of the struggle, Hindu savarNa leaders
> had managed to mobilize both lower strata of Hindu society and the
> tribal forest peoples against the English. The latter were hence
> targeted for subversion and were set up as a counterbalance for the
> forward caste Hindus. The English also tried to create a rift among
> the forward castes by classifying the particularly restive kAyastha-s
> as shUdra-s contrary to Hindu tradition. These well-known actions of
> the English left them with a sufficient raw material in the form of
> the Mohammedans and the people of the lower social strata as potential
> first responders. Additionally, after the emergence of fiery
> nationalist leaders like Tilak (a brAhmaNa) and Aurobindo (a kAyastha
> of the bomb in Bengal movement) and subsequently the armed struggle,
> the English closely “managed” the liberation movement by eliminating
> such dangerous leaders and attempting to channelize the Indian
> expression via more non-threatening leaders epitomized by the
> Gandhi-Nehru clique. These activities also gave the English further
> opportunities to plant first responders. The aftermath of WWII,
> however, left the English power in a disarray. Their initial defeat at
> the hands of Japan had smashed their image of invincibility in the
> eyes of Indians. The subsequent trial of the Indian National Army of
> Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian reaction to it showed that the
> Indians were unlikely to be suppressed for much longer and the days of
> the British empire were numbered. This realization seems to have led
> to concerted action by the English to have their first responders in
> place to give the Indians long-lasting pain from a parting sting even
> as the imperial scorpion was forced to scurry out of the subcontinent
> of jaMbudvIpa.
