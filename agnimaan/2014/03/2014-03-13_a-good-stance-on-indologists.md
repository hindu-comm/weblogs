A good stance on Indologists.

> My main criticism of certain white indologists and their diverse
> fellow travelers is political. Their political activism is detrimental
> to Hindus as minority in krau\~ncha dvIpa and to our people in
> jambu-dvIpa. If they can sign a letter supporting a German ‘scholar’,
> a full professor at a renowned school, who in a public forum called
> Hindus of North America as “hIna”; associated North American Hindus
> with Nazi-s “Since they won’t be returning to India, \[Hindus
> immigrants to the USA\] have begun building crematoria as well”; and
> supporting the anti-Hindu system of the mlechCha subversionists note
> their letter contained citations from the State Department Cold
> warriors who are notorious for their anti-India stance over decades.
> In this yuddha my pakSha is clear. Yes, the political views of the
> Indologists might affect their work, but it is not a reason to shut
> your eyes to it offhand. In fact, there might be useful stuff in their
> research. It is a well-known fact that many modern Hindus do not want
> to spend time studying deva bhASha or the prakR^it-s and cannot handle
> much of their literature even at a rudimentary level. So they need
> turn to these indologists. Like taking the Zilebia and the Samosa from
> whom your opponent you need to take what is useful even from the
> adversarial indologists. Become a nR^iharI to the hiraNyakashipu of
> their political agenda but support other Indologists who are
> apolitical or supportive like prahlAda.
