American use of christianity in Korea, Vietnam and Japan

> Subsequently, the Americans waded into Vietnam to reinforce the white
> domination over Asian states. In these battles the Americans imitated
> the English strategy of setting up first responders. An important
> facet of the first responders set up by the Americans was the more
> blatant use of Christianity: Being less tempered by Charles Darwin
> than the English, the Americans were way more ready to use this viral
> West Asian memeplex to mentally subvert people there by creating large
> masses of first responders as well as sleeper cells. The strategy
> worked wonders in Korea and early one in Vietnam. However, these
> efforts were less successful during their occupation of Japan due to
> the earlier extensive immunization program against Christianity by the
> Japanese elite and the private protection of Shinto and bauddha ritual
> despite its public restriction.
