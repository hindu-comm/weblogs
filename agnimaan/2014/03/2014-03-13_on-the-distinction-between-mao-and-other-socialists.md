On the distinction between Mao and other socialists

> Thus, Mao Zedong was not like any other socialist leader from the
> Soviet world, or Latin American or India. The allegiances of these
> latter socialists is not towards their nation rather towards the
> utopian Marxian realm – the comrades are much like the Mohammedan
> brothers of the pan-Islamic Umma. Thus, they are anti-national by
> definition and adopt a transnational Marxian identity. After initially
> displaying such an facade, Mao Zedong unveiled his real nature – he
> was the new Han emperor – the ultimate Han nationalist who ruled as
> the center of the legalist system even as the wall-building lord of
> the Chin founded that state. Hence, Maoism in China is ultimately the
> same legalist system by which the great chIna emperors held their
> sway. But what is Maoism elsewhere, like say in India, is actually an
> imitation by fools, which is very distinction from its Chinese
> cognomen. It is just the shell which acts against the nation-state
> without the inner ruling force of legalism that most aggressively
> upholds the Chinese nation. Once, the Anglosphere realized this, it
> became a tool to amplify and cloak their first responders.
