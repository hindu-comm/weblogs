Litmus tests for hindus

So said the Arya:

> “If one is alarmed/disturbed by the establishment of a Hindu
> nationalist gov in bhArata is not logical that they do not belong to
> the nation?”
>
> Also: “People who do not understand the significance of having the
> shrine of rAmachandra aikShvAkava right there in Ayodhya have no link
> to bhArata. When visceral connection to 2 itihAsas is replaced by urge
> to accommodate marUnmattas in name of peace,secularism etc bhArata’s
> dead to them. such an India is meaningless to a H merely a
> geographical entity which may ruled by one or other overt or covert
> manifestation of Abrahamism. No H should take the words such people
> seriously on any national matter&they should be cast aside as a stone
> or a South Asianist.”
