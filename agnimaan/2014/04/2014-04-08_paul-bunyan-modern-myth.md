Paul Bunyan – Modern myth!

> Bunyan’s birth was somewhat unusual, as are the births of many mythic
> heroes, as it took five storks to carry the infant (ordinarily, one
> stork could carry several babies and drop them off at their parents’
> homes). When he was old enough to clap and laugh, the vibration broke
> every window in the house. When he was seven months old, he sawed the
> legs off his parents’ bed in the middle of the night.\[13\] Paul and
> his companion Babe the Blue Ox dug the Grand Canyon when he dragged
> his axe behind him. He created Mount Hood by piling rocks on top of
> his campfire to put it out.
>
> Babe the Blue Ox, Bunyan’s companion, was a massive creature with
> exceptional strength.\[14\] Most imagery of Bunyan shows Babe the Blue
> Ox as of proportionate size (meaning massive compared to typical
> oxen). Among other subjects, a myth about the formation of Great Lakes
> was centered around Babe: Paul Bunyan needed to create a watering hole
> large enough for Babe to drink from.\[10\] There are also stories that
> Minnesota’s 10,000 lakes were formed by Paul and Babe’s footprints
> while they wandered blindly in a deep blizzard. Daniel Boone and Davy
> Crockett were said to have given Babe to Paul, because they were all
> woodsy pioneer types.
