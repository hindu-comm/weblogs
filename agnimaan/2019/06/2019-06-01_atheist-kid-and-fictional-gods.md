Atheist kid and “fictional” Gods

Characters:

-   P: 8 year old 2nd grader born in USA and raised by a pair of HINO
    (hindus in name only) atheists to be a thorough materialist
    skeptical of religious rituals, deities and claims. She likes “God
    bless the USA” song.
-   V: mother of P
-   N: mother of V, a more “proper” practicing Hindu.
-   K: brother of V, a more “proper” practicing H; who has long resigned
    himself to the fact that P’s spiritual trajectory is set to be
    severely handicapped.

P steps on a book. Books are considered abodes of sarasvatI, Godess of
knowledge – and stepping on a book is taboo for practicing hindus.
Granny N and P have a brief exchange where N fails to make P see the
error of her ways.

V overhears this and tells K: Explain to P in your way.  
K: What is the point? It’s no use.  
V: Ok – tell me what you would say.  
K: SarasvatI lives in books, it is wrong to disrespect her by stamping
on her abodes. Books must be treated with respect. Else sarasvatI might
get angry.  
V: But SarasvatI is not real.  
K: If you have understood thus, you have understood wrong.

K goes to take a shower, and as he does so, several thoughts come to
mind. “Hmm – Ok, it would be remiss of me not to give it a shot. Should
I point V to Sallustius’s note? I doubt it’ll help. What about …. Yes –
that will be a good angle of attack.” He comes out and faces P, who is
in a hurry to get to school.

K: Hey P – Is USA real?  
P: What do you mean?  
K: Is USA real like the moon or the sun or the earth?  
(Repeat a couple of times.)  
P: Yes it is – You are standing on it right now.  
K: But isn’t it fictional? Made up by people?  
P: What do you mean?  
V: If I killed all humans, would there be USA?  
P, seemingly confused, after some thought, tying her shoe lace: I don’t
quite understand what you’re saying, but – it is man made, but it is
real.  
K: Ok – so USA is a made-up real thing.  
P: I guess so.

K: Ok, then – would stamp on a USA flag and show it disrespect?  
P: what?  
K repeats the question, as does V, who has rushed over.  
P: No.

K: Ok, You like to hear to and sing your national anthem every day? That
“God bless the USA” song?  
P: It’s not the anthem.  
K: Whatever it is – that song.  
P: I guess so.  
K: And do you say your national anthem daily at school.  
V interjects: the pledge.  
P: They made us say it.  
K: But would you disrespect it, not say it or sit down?  
P: No.

K: So, you respect a made-up real concept called USA and honor its
rituals.  
P: I did not much understand whatever you said in the past few
minutes.  
K: That’s expected – your parents haven’t talked to you in this way, so
it is all new. But you respect a made-up real concept called USA.  
Now think about it – SarasvatI is far less fictional than this made-up
real thing you call USA.

P rushes off to school.  
V: Good job, uncle K.

(K remains skeptical if this interaction had any lasting impact on P,
much less mommy V. Still, it is not implausible.)
