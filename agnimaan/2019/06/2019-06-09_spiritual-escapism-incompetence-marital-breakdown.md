Spiritual escapism, incompetence, marital breakdown

A couple of ISKCON related reviews from the same woman (located in
California):

From about Mar 2019:

> “If any devotees tell me why devotees are ready to leave their family,
> house etc.…. and do not want to work anymore try to leave everything
> go Ashram because since my husband became devotee he is keeping
> telling me that I don’t want live with you and I have daughter too. He
> told me if you don’t fellow my Krishna conscious path then I have
> leave you. One day I forgot to put his food in front Krishna then he I
> asked me Did you put my dinner in front of Krishna? and I told him I
> forgot it then Oh my god he was very much angry on me and he was
> telling me that I gave you too much freedom to you but I know how to
> put you down or cut your feather. I do not know what was that why he
> sooo much angry on me. Today me and my daughter we are on very bad
> shape because he is leaving us soon like never come back. I don’t know
> what to do because he gave me dead line meaning he is leaving. He
> tells me every time if you fellow my paths then only you are my wife
> otherwise I have to go forever not come back. Anyways I have so much
> to write but I do not know where and how to start.  
> I prayer for my friends and my family that never ever they get this
> situation like me where am I today.“

From about May 2019:

> then because I have a home responsibilities because he don’t do
> anything since morning he lock himself in the room and all day long do
> chanting anyways He is Give Gita student … When I ask him why you do
> not want to work he always tells me that “one day we have to die so
> why should I work” that’s make me surprise where is getting all these
> knowledge anyways when he gets upset on me and talk to me very badly
> he use inappropriate words because he thinks women has no rights to do
> anything. He told my daughter that he do not like to live in USA
> that’s perfectly fine for me and he told my daughter you need to come
> with me in India and when my daughter asked him why I need to go India

> lecture and sleep and next day same routine…………..

The above bring so many problems (on both sides) to mind. Just listing a
few:

-   Poor mate choice.
-   Excessive focus on mokSha, insufficient focus on (gRhastha) dharma.
    Just too much desire to escape from “saMsAra”. Even kRShNa said: ”
    श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात् । स्वधर्मे निधनं
    श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः ॥”
-   Despite a mostly disinterested wife, one can raise a pretty dhArmika
    child if one is smart about it. With an abundance of patience, one
    can even bring the wife around.
-   Inability to communicate and convince the other party. This could be
    due to poor intellectual ability on both sides. Females in general
    tend to naturally think less about social consequences, and tend to
    be more narrowly artha-centered.
-   An erosion of kula and family saMskAra-s leading to a vacuum which
    is then filled by poor and narrow interpretations of hindu dharmas
    on one hand and feminism/ careerism/ western modernism on another.
    Generally, hindu female quality has seen a precipitous decline in
    the past generations, comparable to male quality decline even
    earlier.
