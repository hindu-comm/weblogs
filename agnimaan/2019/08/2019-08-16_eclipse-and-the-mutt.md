> ECLIPSE and the MUTT  
> ===================  
> Once a learned traditional scholar, Acharya called on me at my office
> with an interesting query. He gave me a piece of paper on which was
> scribbled in Kannada a certain year of the Shalivahana shaka (era),
> the lunar month (like Chaitra, Vaishakha etc), the weekday and that it
> was an Amavasya (new-moon). He asked me if I could help him by
> checking up if there was a solar eclipse that day. In the data given
> by him the corresponding Christian (Common Era) date was not given. I
> wondered how he knew that I could help him. He told me that he was
> guided to me by a learned (modern) professional astronomer whom he
> consulted. Well, I told him that I would check up the details at home
> using my own computer program and requested him to meet me two days
> later. The same evening I converted the given traditional date to the
> corresponding Gregorian date and worked out the details like (i) the
> true positions of the Sun, the Moon and Rahu (ascending node of the
> Moon), (iii) Moon’s latitude, (iv) angular diameters of the the Sun
> and the Moon etc. Lo and behold, all these elaborate computations did
> result in a solar eclipse on the given date. My excitement was so much
> that I could not rest till I announced the good result ( like a
> restless father at his ‘putrotsava’!). But I didn’t have his contact
> details. After my impatient wait for two days he did turn up with an
> anxious look. I gave him the very good news that there was indeed a
> solar eclipse on the date he had given. Much to my disappointment and
> bewilderment, suddenly he wore a worried look and lowered his face not
> knowing how to react. It was exactly like the reaction of a
> middle-class parent , in our Indian society, on being announced the
> birth of a fourth or fifth daughter with no son in between! I asked
> him what was the problem. To my shock he told me that he wanted no
> eclipse on that day! I wondered why. However, not to disappoint him, I
> promised him that I would cross-check my computations again and
> requested him to meet me a day later. Yes, my computations were all
> correct. The next day he was waiting for me with a thin ray of hope on
> his face (like that of the coalition govt in Karnataka for survival!).
> But I didn’t disappoint the anxious Acharya! My calculations showed
> that though there was a solar eclipse that Amavasya, it would not be
> visible in India since our beloved Suryadeva preferred to hide his
> eclipsed body somewhere in the US when it was night in our punyabhumi!
> He (not the Sun-god) became really jubilant on hearing my
> clarification. The interesting story starts now!  
> He took me into confidence, for all the ‘trouble’ I took for him, and
> explained the history behind the episode. It appears in the
> ‘taamra-patra’ record (copper inscription) at a rival ‘mutt’
> (monastery) it was mentioned that the landed property currently in the
> possession of that ‘mutt’ was gifted by a local chief to the mutt on
> that day of the solar eclipse. It is considered auspicious (earning
> ‘punya’) to the donor to gift land, gold etc on certain special
> (astronomical) occasions like eclipses, sankrantis etc. The contention
> of my ‘client’ and his religious group was that the copper record was
> fake and doctored one and that the property did not belong to that
> rival ‘mutt’ at all! So his glee knew no bounds at all since I had
> ‘clinched’ the issue in his favour ‘scientifically’! He insistantly
> collected a ‘certified’ letter from me on our office letter-head to
> produce it as an official document!
