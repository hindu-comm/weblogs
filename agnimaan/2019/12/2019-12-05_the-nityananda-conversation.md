The nityAnanda conversation

The below is replicated from:

> Nithyananda:  
> ——————
>
> I am not a fan of Nithyananda. I consider him a fraud. However, I
> generally desist from mocking Hindu gurus, even fake ones, in public
> because by shining the spotlight on alleged or real problems in
> Hinduism we’re indirectly aiding and abetting Christian proselytism.
>
> Yesterday, a white Christian colleague derisively brought up the news
> of Nithyananda during lunch. A couple of Hindu colleagues joined him
> in mocking Nithyananda. After 2-3 minutes, I calmly said, “Yes,
> Nithyananda is a fraud but every religion has its share of charlatans.
> See, Christianity has Jesus and Islam has Muhammad just as Hinduism
> has Nithyananda. It is alleged that Nithyananda raped some female
> disciples. Muhammad also raped defenseless women. Jesus raped his own
> mother. Jesus and Muhammad also preached so much hatred against
> non-believers. Nithyananda is slightly better because he is not into
> demagoguery. Guys, we can spend the rest of the day talking about the
> misdeeds of this trinity of frauds (Jesus, Muhammad, and
> Nithyananda).”
>
> A few moments of pin-drop silence ensued. Then the white Christian
> dude asked, “Should we get back to work?” The Hindu dhimmis nodded. I
> said, “Yes, for now. Let’s again catch up over coffee to discuss
> Nithyananda and the trinity.”
>
> Moral of the story: Every time someone brings up the alleged or real
> misdeeds of Hindu gurus, equate such gurus with Jesus and Muhammad and
> shine the spotlight on the Abrahamic frauds.
