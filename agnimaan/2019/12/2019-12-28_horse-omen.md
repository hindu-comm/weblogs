Horse omen

Suppose one buys a new car. Then one performs pUjA to it and the
obstacle-shattering deity sitting in the dashboard. Just as one is about
to start the car and roll over the lemon pieces under the tire, a pair
of mares get sent by the Gods out of nowhere. They stand right behind
the car. Surprised family folk call you out. This is the middle of a
south Indian suburb â€“ and long gone are the days when buffaloes, donkeys
and horses were a common sight.

One suspects that this is a good omen, feed the horses some fruits, pats
them, sings the sAman to great Indra known as AshvasUktam and follows
them for a while, recalling some favorite mongol horse songs. This motor
chariot seems blessed.
