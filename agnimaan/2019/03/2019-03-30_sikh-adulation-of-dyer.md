Sikh adulation of Dyer

Kalavai [posted the

about General Dyer of Jallianwalla bAgh massacre infamy:

> The British hailed Dyer as a hero. The Sikh priests of the Akal Takht
> and the Golden Temple also hailed Dyer as a hero. They initiated Dyer
> into the Khalsa and presented him a robe of honor. They also invited
> Dyer to become a Sikh. The conversation which transpired was as
> hilarious as it was disgusting.
>
> “Sahib,” (the Sikh priests) said, “You must become a Sikh.” Dyer
> thanked them for the honor but pointed out that as a British officer
> he couldn’t grow his hair long. The Sikh priests let him crop his
> hair. Dyer then informed them that he couldn’t give up smoking either.
> The Sikh priests replied that he could give it up gradually. Dyer
> replied, “That I promise you – at the rate of one cigarette a year.”
>
> It is shocking to see the extent of servility toward British among our
> leaders even while the colonial predator were butchering our people.
