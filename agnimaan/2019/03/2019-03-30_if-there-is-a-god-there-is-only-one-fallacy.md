“If there is a god there is only one” fallacy

The below is from

> I usually avoid discussing religion or politics at work although
> everyone knows my views. However, I do freely discuss those views with
> colleagues outside of work. Once an American colleague, who is an
> Evangelical Christian, remarked, “Assuming there is god there can be
> only one god.” That was his attempt at discrediting Hindu polytheism.

> I replied, “That is akin to arguing that if there is dream then there
> can be only one dream.” I then elaborated that if god is imaginary
> then why restrict yourself to only one imaginary god. why not have
> variety? When would westerners get out of the missionary position
> mindset and explore variety?
>
> “Okay, what if god is real?” asked my colleague.
>
> “You have no proof whatsoever that god is real. However, assuming
> he/she/it is real then the monotheistic argument is akin to arguing
> that only pizza is real and all other food is false. It is just
> arbitrary. Polytheism is superior because just as multiple food items
> could manifest from the same ingredients multiple gods could manifest
> from the same substance.”

> Monotheism is the product of dumb minds lacking in creativity.
