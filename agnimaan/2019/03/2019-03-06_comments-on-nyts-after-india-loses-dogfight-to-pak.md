Comments on NYT’s “After India Loses Dogfight to Pakistan”

## Comments on the NYT article

A liberal minded US Hindu friend asked me to comment on [an NYT
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/world/asia/india-military-united-states-china.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)
titled “After India Loses Dogfight to Pakistan, Questions Arise About
Its ‘Vintage’ Military”.

The headline and first paragraphs are show clear duplicity – but the
overall message is fine.

Take this paragraph:  
“The aerial clash, the first by the South Asian rivals in nearly five
decades, was a rare test for the Indian military — and it left observers
a bit dumbfounded. While the challenges faced by the India’s armed
forces are no secret, its loss of a plane last week to a country whose
military is about half the size and receives a quarter of the funding
was still telling.”

Seriously?! Loss of planes, lives, tanks etc.. are an expected and
routine part of armed conflict – even the better equipped parties expect
it. Who are these unnamed “observers”? I find it hard to believe that
they are that stupid. Not if they are military analysts, at least (even
if they, against their natural instinct, they discount the F16 loss due
to lack of “Paki corroboration” ). For a very pedestrian baseline,
consider my own 5th generation fighter quantity comparison as the
confrontation happened:

India: Su-30MKI – 242.

TISP (Terrorist Islamic State) : None. But they have 4th gen fighters:
CAC/PAC JF-17, F-16 – 184.

### A pattern

This is not an isolated case of mendacity. Take for example, [this other
article from the same
rag](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/world/asia/india-pakistan-plane-abhinandan-varthaman-india.html)whose
first paragraph read: “When an Indian fighter pilot who had been
captured by Pakistan was released on Friday, it capped a humiliating
episode for India and a surreal week for him.”. Seriously? Are they
mental? What humiliation? Anyone who has contacts on ground in India or
follows Indian government could easily tell that the general mood was
one of jubilation and gusto. One which took the expected loss of lives
and property in stride. One where people were circulating messages like:
“According to Geneva convention, Pakistan have to return Wing Commander
in 7 days. Since the videos are out, they cannot deny that they have him
and torture him. Don’t worry, Abhinandan will be back – as was nachiketa
during last decade’s war.”

### Natural bias of leukospheric outlets

It is natural for NYT, Newyorker, BBC etc.. to write from the
perspective of USA/ leukosphere: “We wanted to use this third world
country against China but they are so incompetent, backwards”, “Oh look!
Modi is a fascist, muslims are in such a pitiful state” ([Vamsee
Juluri’s Newyorker
quote](https://twitter.com/VamseeJuluri/status/1103120584274173953) )
etc.. Which is why they are good to gauge the mood of liberal-minded
people of mlecCha-deshas – but not much else. They don’t even tell us
what people in power in those countries (presidents, diplomats etc..)
think. BBC and NYT were saying stuff to the effect that Imran Khan won
some propaganda battle against Modi ([VJ’s
quote](https://twitter.com/VamseeJuluri/status/1101684213714046976)) –
even as India attended the Organization of Islamic Countries as the
“Guest of Honour”, despite Pakistan’s attempt to disinvite India and
refused to include Kashmir in its resolution till Pakistanis forced it
in.

I personally find it a complete (often painful) waste of time to even
look at their articles, if they are about Hindus or India. To quote
[@nntaleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1103000712970158086):
“Newspapers have officially the right facts, but their interpretations
are imaginary – and their choice of facts are arbitrary. They lie with
right facts; a novelist says the truth with wrong facts.”, and “Every
single fact in the NYT is true. Every bit of news is flase.” The same,
of course, generally applies to Indian English news media – though
relatively speaking – they cannot bullshit as much to the naturally more
knowledgeable Indian/ Hindu audience.

## Comments on Hindu comments about the NYT article

Looking at the comments about NYT’s article, my US Hindu friend was
confused about Indian Hindu mood: “I think this was an opportunity for a
Sputnik moment – Ask for lots of money to upgrade And kick paki butt.
Instead Indians retreat to insecurity. And think Jai Hind helps
(referring to [Air India asking it’s crews to say “jai
hind”](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/05/700512781/air-india-crews-directed-to-hail-the-motherland-after-every-announcement?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social))
… India Twitter is slavishly believing the govt. They should not for
obvious reasons”. To which I clarified:

-   “It is frankly quite logical for Indains to be insecure – they have
    a fifth column in India which is a serious threat. … In all my
    whatsapp groups and on the street, Indians are gung-ho. Yes, there
    is insecurity – but I’ve never seen or heard of even Owaisi (\<–
    look him up) types supporting our military and denouncing pakistan.
    … “
-   “People are in a nationalistic mood right now – so the “jai hind”
    thing fits. There was this video today about a bengaLUru hijabi girl
    getting her phone smashed by her female classmate for putting some
    pro-pAki status, one where angry hindus confronted and forced some
    madarassa muslims to apologize for “pAkistan zindabad” shouts etc..”
-   “I trust Indian military side of the story – in contrast to Paki
    propaganda or NYT/ BBC types. They are professional and have earned
    that kind of trust from us. … They won’t lie – not the air force –
    which did the press conference in this case. … “
-   “Indian politicians and public definitely see the need for urgent
    military upgrades. No second thoughts about it. Everyone is trying
    to blame the other person about not buying 5th gen aircraft
    earlier.”
-   “Responses to NYT are going to be rhetorical and theater. It is a
    bad idea to gauge Indian mood from there. … Good summary –
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=mj3e56T61Po>“
-   “I was following handles such as –  
    <https://twitter.com/China_SCS_info/status/1101390274956124160>  
    <https://twitter.com/BabakTaghvaee/status/1100701871126339584>  
    which are non-Indian –  
    (and even Paki ones which offered direct evidence – interesting
    images and videos).  
    My side of twitter – it was pretty rational.“
