Many rescue the many!

The below is from

> I used to attend enlightening discourses on religion when I was a kid.
> Usually, those discourses happened in the temples but sometimes in an
> open maidan too. The incident I am going to narrate occurred during a
> discourse given by someone whose name I don’t recall. Christian
> missionaries were not as belligerent then as they’re today but they
> would attempt mischief even then.

> A missionary had distributed pamphlets mocking Hindu polytheism. In
> that narrative, a devout Hindu is taking bath in a holy river when he
> suddenly encounters floods. The frightened Hindu appeals to Ganesha to
> rescue him. Ganesha leaves his abode but the Hindu now appeals to
> Shiva. Ganesha turns back assuming Shiva would help the Hindu. Shiva
> steps out of his abode to help but the Hindu now appeals to Vishnu so
> Shiva turns back. This pattern continues and finally none comes to the
> help of the Hindu. He dies in the floods. See polytheism is a bad
> idea!
>
> The Hindu speaker was shown the pamphlet. He responded:
>
> “But let me tell you what happened next. The neighboring village had
> thousands of Christians. They were all bathing and were suddenly
> caught unaware by the floods. One of them appealed to Jesus for help.
> Jesus left his heavenly abode when he heard the cry of another, then
> another, and then thousands of Christians pleading for help. Jesus was
> in a dilemma. He cannot be partial and save some and abandon others.
> So, he decided to remain impartial and stayed back in heaven and let
> those thousands of Christians die in the floods. See monotheism is a
> bad idea!”
