Ganesha chaturthi in a bengaLUru slum

Our festivals are celebrated more sincerely and delightfully by poorer
people (middle class is hopeless by comparison). These two girls, for
example: going door to door asking “gaNeshanna kUrsiddIra” (“have you
seated gaNesha?”), come and offer akShata-s (which they bring), sing a
couple of songs (quite appropriate ones too).

Then there are those pandal-s – gone are the days when middle class
youth undertook such drives. You have to go to slums to see them. I went
to see what they did with the money I contributed and was happy.

In each place, seeing my shikhA and veShTi they ask me with enthusiasm
to do Arati with mantra – “oh wait wait – let the women folk come!”.
(So-called middle-class visitors are rare in such streets.) Reinforces:
“सुखं पृच्छस्व मा धनम्”
