Kalavai’s response to preta’s jibe

The below is replicated from

> A few years ago, I was debating a missionary at a California church. I
> had pulled no punches in attacking Jesus and the Bible. The terribly
> annoyed missionary started his rebuttal with a sarcastic and
> condescending remark: “You seem like a person of above average
> intelligence. How can you worship a cow or a monkey….?”
>
> The entirely Christian audience laughed.
>
> I interjected, “Not just the cow or the monkey but we Hindus worship
> the tree, the rock, the earth, fire, rivers, books, music, arts…” I
> then gave a brief pause and added, “I would rather worship a cow or a
> monkey than worship a crucified convict who could not even save
> himself on the cross.”

> I then apologized for interjecting and asked him to continue. The
> missionary must have felt deflated. He was quite at loss how to deal
> with this line of argument. In my over 16-17 years of debating the
> Christians, no Christian apologist has been able to defend himself
> against this method I’ve employed with 100% success.
>
> (I may have stated this before but thought of recounting because I am
> elated that of late more and more Hindus are debating the way I like –
> and the only way I know is winnable.)
