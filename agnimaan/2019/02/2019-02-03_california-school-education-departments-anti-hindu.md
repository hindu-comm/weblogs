California School Education department’s anti-hindu conspirators

An interesting press release from CAPEEM follows:

> **FEDERAL COURT UNSEALS RECORDS OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF
> EDUCATION’S RELIGIOUS BIAS SCHEME**
>
> **FREMONT, CA  
> 02 FEBRUARY 2019**
>
> Judge Charles Breyer has unsealed emails showing Department of
> Education officials soliciting and coordinating professors’ anti-Hindu
> reports on 2016 drafts of the California-History Social Science
> Framework that were falsely presented as “public comment.”
>
> Tom Adams, the Deputy Superintendent at the California Department of
> Education, who has a history of working behind the scenes with
> professors who create anti-Hindu curriculum content, secretly
> contacted a group of professors with whom he had worked in the past.
> One of the professors, Jonathan Kenoyer of the University of
> Wisconsin, had co-authored a textbook the Curriculum Commission had
> rejected in 2005 for mocking Hinduism. Adams had then organized a
> group of professors who had not read this book to protest its
> rejection and used their protests to manipulate the State Board of
> Education into overruling the Commission’s decision to reject the
> textbook.
>
> The scheme by Adams to avoid the process for retaining experts as
> contemplated by California Department of Education regulation and
> secretly recruit professors who could be relied upon to provide
> content derogatory of Hinduism during the Framework adoption process
> in 2016 was revealed through a subpoena on Kenoyer in the case of
> *California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials
> (CAPEEM) v. Torlakson*, No. 3:17-cv-00635, pending in the U.S.
> District Court for the Northern District of California. The emails
> among the professors show they understood they were to use “smoke and
> mirrors” to address the input of Hindu groups and one of the
> professors recognized that “readers of our report can imagine that
> \[the report\] is meant to undermine the legitimacy of Hinduism as a
> religion (and Hinduism uniquely among religions, at that).” One
> comment that shows the hostility of the professors accuses Hindus of
> appropriating the Vedas, Upanishads and the Gita and calling it the
> foundation of Hinduism.
>
> The emails had been filed under seal until Thursday, when Judge Breyer
> agreed with the plaintiffs and ruled that neither the Regents of the
> University of California nor Professor Kenoyer had shown “compelling
> reasons” to keep the records under seal. “This is an important ruling
> that rejects the notion that government officials and professors can
> hide behind the label ‘academic freedom’ and allows all Californians
> to better understand how their government develops the public school
> curriculum,” noted Arvind Kumar, a board member of the Fremont-based
> CAPEEM. “Unfortunately, the emails reveal secrecy and doublespeak,” he
> added.
>
> The court made clear that unsealed records may well be relevant to the
> claims brought by CAPEEM and Bay Area parents that the Framework is
> derogatory to Hinduism, since they argue that state officials
> coordinated with the professors to provide reports on the curriculum
> was falsely construed as public comment. “We knew that the content of
> the Framework treats Hinduism differently from other faiths but the
> emails show the bad faith by the officials who created that content,”
> said Glenn Katon, an Oakland civil rights lawyer representing CAPEEM
> and the parents. “This is another strong indication of the State’s
> violation of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.”
>
> The Court has yet to rule on motions filed by both sides arguing they
> are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The order and unsealed
> documents and can be found
