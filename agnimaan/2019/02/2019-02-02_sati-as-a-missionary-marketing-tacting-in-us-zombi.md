sati as a missionary marketing tacting in US zombie school

The below is replicated from



> I just received a note from a white American FB friend. She is a high
> school teacher in a Christian school. She is no longer a believer, has
> rejected Jesus and Christianity, and although she doesn’t officially
> follow any religion she likes Hinduism. Outwardly she pretends to be a
> Christian as otherwise she would lose her job and be shunned in the
> American Midwest.
>
> She said her school screened a movie called Polar for the 9th graders
> today. She was disturbed due to many reasons. The movie had numerous
> violent scenes and bloodbath, nudity and sex, and foul language.
> However, she was most disturbed by a dialog in the movie where
> schoolkids ask the protagonist, “How do they bury the dead in India?”
> He replies, “They don’t bury. They burn them. If the man dies first,
> they burn the wife alive as well.” The movie was paused.

> The children gasped and were in a state of shock. It was followed by a
> discussion. The teacher discussed sati, which figures prominently in
> all American textbooks. An Indian convert to Christianity was brought
> in. She brought up the lone incident of sati from the 80s in a slide
> presentation and gave the impression it is a commonplace event. The
> program ended with an appeal to the kids that they should support
> missionary activities because it is only the message of Jesus which
> would save hundreds of millions of Indian women who’re burnt alive on
> funeral pyre everyday.
>
> Christianity doesn’t have any noble teaching. It can only spread by
> vilifying other religions. That is all it has done from the day the
> Bible was written. That is what happens everyday. Woe be to those
> Hindus who’re misled by the exterior acts of pretense and Christian
> taqiyya into thinking that Christians want to coexist.
>
> America remains one of the most uncivilized countries on earth. The
> tech labs and university research centers are just one small aspect of
> America. Outside of these, America is a vast ocean steeped in medieval
> ignorance coupled with arrogance.
