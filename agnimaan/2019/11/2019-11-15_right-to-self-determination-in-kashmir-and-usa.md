Right to self determination in Kashmir and USA

Sunanda Vasisht, a Kashmiri Pandit Hindu free from Stockholm syndrome
prominent among some of her kind, testified
([YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSDc_X3GYM&feature=youtu.be&t=4322),
[YT2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSDc_X3GYM&feature=youtu.be&t=4322))
before a barbarian congress which consistently seeks to civilize us
enough to subject ourselves to interminable Abrahamist (including
Islamist) assault.

Having entered their forum, one cannot be too honest and tell them to
\*\*\*\* off – rather one has to trounce them within the confines of
their principles and logic. Given these parameters, the testimony was
excellent and inspiring, barring a couple of where she was stumped. This
bugged me for some time and forced me to think what kind of responses
would have been more suitable (yes – they require preparation).

-   “**Right to self determination**“.
    -   [YT2](https://youtu.be/DPSDc_X3GYM?t=8134). An appropriate
        response would have been along these lines: “What about the
        right to self determination of the **Confederate States of
        America**? Your greatest leader refused this right to them. Just
        as your nation thought that it was fine to deny this right to
        slavers, we deny this right to genocidal Jihadis.”
-   “**We want to visit Kashmir and decide ourselves**“.
    -   An appropriate response might have been: “This proposition
        dangerous to Kashmiris. US propaganda and intervention has
        doomed Syria, Iraq and Lybia. (Remember Saddam’s WMDs.)
        Pro-pakistan and pro-islamist members of congress will take
        advantage of the opportunity to get photo-ops for their mission.
        And we bet that Yankees would not have taken kindly to
        international government visits and subversions favoring the
        **Confederate States of America**.”
