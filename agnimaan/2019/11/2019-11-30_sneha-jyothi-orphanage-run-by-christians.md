Sneha Jyothi orphanage run by Christians

Goods vehicles from the Sneha Jyothi organization are a frequent
(roughly monthly) sight in many localities Bengaluru localities
(including Basaveshvara Nagara and sahakAra nagara). They solicit
donations – both monetary (“annadAna”) and material (old clothes) etc..

## The question

While I am open to supporting orphanages, I oppose conversion of Hindus
to Christianity and Islam. So, I wanted to know if the orphanage is run
by Christians.

In other words: Are they just confused Hindus or are they some carefully
crafted Christian program aimed at fooling Hindus?

PS: Hindu or non-religious orphanages and charities are not hard to
find. There is one a few blocks away from where I live. Infact, one such
famous charity – <https://www.samarthanam.org/> was an inspiration to
Sneha Jyothi.

## Bases of suspicion

-   I automatically become suspicious if there is sneha or prema in the
    org name (deliberately chosen to confuse Hindus like the adaption of
    neutral English names by M businessmen).
-   A few weeks ago, I sent away some lady collecting money for a
    similar (same?) org after point-blank asking her if it was a
    Christian org – she had admitted that it was and that she herself
    was a Christian.
-   Their website has a picture of the notorious anti-hindu missionary
    Mother Theresa.

## Sources of confusion

-   They send Hindus with tilakas for soliciting donations, one of whom
    denied any Christian connection when asked point-blank a couple of
    months ago.
-   The donation collection plays sai baba songs (“Sai Ram Sai Ram mere
    sai ram … sabse mahaan”) and show collages which include a
    [yakShagAna pic](https://i.imgur.com/OfyPCoE.jpg), one gets
    confused.

## Confirmation

-   A Google investigation reveals that founder TG Murthy’s son is
        named T.M David (from [this
        article](https://i.imgur.com/ANrha9a.jpg)). Interestingly, his
        mother is named Sarasamma.
    -   Ms. R.Daisy is a Managing Trustee.
