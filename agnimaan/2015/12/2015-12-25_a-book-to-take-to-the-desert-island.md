A book to take to the desert island.

A commonplace question is: “If you could take one book with you as you
are marooned on a desert island, what would it be?”. Assuming that my
bodily needs were adequately taken care of, my current answer is clear.
It is not rAmAyaNa or mahAbhArata or kathAsaritsAgara or raghuvaMsha or
kumArasambhava or (horrors) the bhAgavata purANa.

It is**subhAShita-ratna-bhANDAgara**. If I can take only one chapter,
it would be the initial mangalAcaraNa-prakaraNam. Such exquisite
beauty!With each shloka one can loose oneself in a wonderfuluniverse.
What to say of thousands of them? A sample pertaining to our great
clansman:
