Rabid dog barks at the elephant

Little gajAsyahas been listening to his fatherwithgreat devotion
andenthusiasm. At hisbehest, he has devoured the nItishAstra-s of
**viShNusharman** and **nArAyaNa-bhaTTa** in the winterholidays.
Nowthe precocious lad had begun to study the contemporaneous works his
father has compiled for him. In particular, he loves the works of the
great sage of **mAnasatarangiNI**.Its metaphorical thinking,
thesanskrit inspired verbiage and the stunningly clear thought
naturally grip his mind like the svara-s and rahasya-s of a well
conceived mantra. After a longnight under the stars, hearkening tohis
fatherdiscussingthe struggle in the homeland with the
wise**vajrins**visiting from afar, he retires to sleep.

## The matriarch’s tale

Curiously, the great simian he invoked before dozing off has turned him
into an elephant. The matriarch’s soothing rumbling somehow is now
identifiable assamskrta.

He invokes the terrible horse headed protector of wisdom as well as the
lady who yet flows strongly through the mouths of wise pashus; and
settles down to listen:

*The gentle animalsroam the forests happily and develop high cultures.
Until one day, when rabies (**strain C**) begins to spread among some
animals. Rabid dogs bite the wolves and the virus jumps many species.
These infected animals, frothing at the mouth, then begin to terrorize
the relatively gentler animals with their holy wars. Or at least an
unbearably significant fraction of them do, while the rest watch. No
animal not showing signs of infection is spared. Several formidable
continents completely fall to various strains of the virus, so that
there is almost no uninfected animal left. Rare flashes of resistance
like **julian** the mammoth and **plethon** the lion show up, but the
rabid animals finish them off.*

*The **jambu** island too gets hit a millennium after the first major
outbreak(**strain I**). For a long time, the animals have no idea what
has hit them. They do not understand why these crazy obnoxious wolves
are so keen to bite them.Are they just stupid barbarians? Do they have
some sort of a disease?Theelephants put up a mighty resistance. After
several centuries, they begin to contain the infection.*

*Just as they are beginning to comprehend the root of the problem, and
before they are able to even consider reversing the contagion, the
sacred island gets hit by yet another strain of the virus (**strain
S**)- this time carried by a band of red coated foxes. They are very
patient, much unlike the previous lupine invasion.After strategic
encirclement and successful exploitation of the divisions within the
denizens of jambu, they come to rule.*

![s4ng6ne](https://agnimaan.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/s4ng6ne.jpg?w=584)

*Within the newer invaders, the virus has mutated, thanks tocompetition
with the retrovirus sprungby **Plethon** the lion before his death in
the island of the **yavana**-s.The virus is, as a result, milder in the
foxes. Still, itis very far indeed from loosing its contagious power.
It remarkably infects other animals at a slow but deadly pace, so that
it takes a fewgenerations for an animal to succumb fully to it. Such an
animal acts very strangely. It still froths at the mouth and continually
bothersuninfected animals (whom it calls primitive and superstitious).
But, rather than biting them at once, it just insists that themore
deadly strains should be allowed to spread without any hinderance. It
calls those that resist such a proposal intolerant fascist unsecular
scum.This milder strain of the virusis perfectly content to compete
for supremacyin a population completely infected by itself (**strain
S**)or its earlier relatives(**strains C or I**). As such, **strains C,
I and S** present a fairly united front as far as the uninfected are
concerned (if they exist, that is).*

*In the meantime, in the islands of the **uShAputra**-s, the wise
macaques faced aninvasion by leopardsinfected by a particularly
virulent form of**strain C**. However, they had several advantages over
their spiritual cousins, the wise elephants of **jambu** island, in
facing this invasion: they were more united politically,farmore
homogenous (so that the rabid leopard clearly stood out as an alien)
and, as a younger culture, more willing to learn the motivations of the
feline berserkers. The leadership of their wellstructured society
responded ruthlessly and ferociously. No leopard was left alive in their
lands,every leopard half-breed was exiled, and thelocal infected
population was either killed off or meticulouslydecontaminated. They
then shut down their islandsto keep the contagionsout. Eventually,
rabid eagles (with**strain S**) from the **ramaNaka** island forced
them to drop isolation. The wise macaques reacted swiftly and modernized
their sticks and stones. As vigilant as everto guard their uninfected
forest, they began a steady program of pushing back the power of the
infected barbarians from the far eastern reaches of the nearby jambu
island, inflicting stunning losses on their foes.*

*Ultimately, however, the power of theforces infected by **strains C
and S**was just too much, and after heavy losses, they admitted defeat.
But, they had accomplished something remarkable.So much of the infected
forces’ power was spent fighting them, and such was the rebellion they
inspired in uninfected populations of **jambu** island that the forces
of**strains C and S**were forced to withdraw. By sacrificing a great
deal of blood, the macaques had not only saved their holy groves, they
had also helped their spiritual cousins.The forests of the elephants
wasnominally freed – but alas,huge populations were infected by
**strains I, S and C**. Much as the weakened elephants tried,these
strains were gaining the upper hand in their groves, and there was no
sign of respite.*

The matriarch then looked directly at gajAsya and said: “*Young calf,
this is the situation you are faced with. Understand and be afraid.
Study the past closely as well as the nIti basics and the tantras of the
thunderbolts. It is up to you to carry on the long fight for freedom. It
is not right that we should flicker out in this pitiful dishonorable
manner. Thedivine beings made us better than that! They await us in the
stars*.” She fell silent.

![cntyz6l](https://agnimaan.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/cntyz6l.jpg?w=584)

gajAsya quitely paid obeisence,and walked away in melancholy. He
invoked the thunderbolt weilding elephant rider who guides animals to
victory and grindsopponents to dust as he sought to calm his rage and
contemplated strategy. Out of nowhere, a rabid dog appeared and started
barking viciously at him and started slandering the whole elephantine
species. Observing it carefully, gajAsya recognized **strain S**. Like
ekalavya of the great epic, he responded (for the benefit of the
innocent spectating deer) with a fewcarefully placed word-arrows. The
dog however, continued to bark. Just as he was about to respond …

He woke up. The fingers of the million-ray-ed fire in the sky had
entered his body through his eyes and was tugging athis heart. He made
fastto join his father and his friends in paying obeisance to the solar
life giver: “May that unblemished brightness of Sol cleanse us!”

## Afterword:

prabuddhi, gajAsya’s anglophone cousin, came across this curious report
in his diary. Though she was 4 years older, she could not understand
half of what he said – the references were obscure, and even the English
words were unusual (let alone the sanskrit ones). For example, she did
not quite understand what **I, S** and **C** stand for in the strain
names, or what the islands of **jambu**, **yavana**-s, **ramaNaka** and
**uShAputra**-s were. Her curiosity was piquedthough – she was sure
there was more to this story. She knew there was no use asking him or
his dad – they liked to speak in riddles and metaphors from the ocean of
paganlore. Furthermore, she was too proud to come across like her
middle aged aunt who would cause endless amusement by rolling her squint
eyes when hit senseless byideasin sentences longer than 10 words. She
resolved to work it out herself, with the help of internet. Plethon and
Julian – these she could look up. Couldthese events somehow relate to
events in the world history? Could the islands correspond to places? The
strains – could some of them correspond to major memetic viruses that
gajAsya’s dad spoke about? She contemplated all this as she sat across
from the statue of the awakened one insolitude.
