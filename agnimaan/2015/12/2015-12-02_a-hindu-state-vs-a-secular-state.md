A hindu state vs a secular state.

# What’s a hindu state?

A Hindu state might have the following (besides what one normally
expects of a functioning government)

-   state rituals,
-   potentially organized quarantine and disinfection of peoplein the
    grips of the intolerant Abrahamist mental afflictions.

A secular state (in the sense of theLeukosphericstates such as 21st
century USA or France, rather than the Abrahamophilic Indian state or
19th century USA) is obviously inferior tosuch a Hindustate (from our
point of view, of course).

# That said, how much worse is a truly secular state?

-   Obviously, the Abrahamistic diseases will be allowed to spread quite
    freely.
-   Worse, it may pursue the detriment of hindus and pagans as a matter
    of foreign policy.
-   Butat least conscious, stubborn, conservative (yet modern)Hindus
    who study and practice the ways of their ancestors will be free to
    practice and propagate their superior ways of self cultivation and
    social harmony (minus the important governmental aspect, of course).
    -   In any case, the number of idiots in any society is despairingly
        large. The modern orthodox hindu elite can keep to their
        practices, which would hypothetically grant them aclearedge in
        the pursuit of material and sentimentalhappiness.
    -   The modern hindu orthodoxy can bide their time in this stasis
        mode for ages, until the day they get an opportunity to help
        their less fortunate fellow men, women and shemen attain astate
        free of the vexing Abraham disease.
-   At least it will be much better than even the moderate non-secular
    Islamic/ Christian/ Jewsish states!
    -   FYI – as a poignant example – even Bali and Indonesian hindus in
        generalarein jeopardy. There are oppressivelaws curtailing
        construction of temples.

# Why this analysis?

This sort of comparison is critical given the facts that:

-   most Hindus in the dumbocratic Islamophilic republic of India do not
    care to strive for a Hindu state.
-   In most other countries, barring Nepal, there is currently nearly
    zero chance of Hindu rule.
-   Certain hindus are faced with the choice of how they might
    facilitate the choice of country by their proximal and distant
    progeny.

We have omitted someimportant factors are not considered, though, such
as:

-   The moral imperativeto fight the good fight for the Hindu state
    –untilthe last possible moment when it is absolutely clear that
    hope is lost.
-   The attractivenessofsome non-hindu pagan states which have
    awakened to the dangerous abrahamic contagion (eg – Bhutan, Burma).

As usual, intelligentfeedback is most welcome.
