THE vIra-rasa-kAvya of today

I thought
reading[shivarAjyodayam](https://archive.org/details/shivarAjyodayam),by
shrIdhara-bhAskara of the varNekar-s,(I have a hard copy) will put me
back to sleep, but boy, how wrong I was. The reason I picked this
bookwas to hope against hope that it would provide some hope for a
solid future for hindu-s, despite our populationbeing moron-heavy –
after all, shivAji’s time was filled with even worse uncertainty, with
similar problems arising fromcollaborators, foreign powers and native
slumber.The work is high in poetic quality –I have recently adapted a
habit of marking high quality verses with scores (1-5), and there were a
lot of 5-s.

But beyond mere ornamentation, it exuded such vIra-rasa like warm blood
fromapunctured enemychest.I’ve read large portions of raghuvaMsha,
kumArasambhava, etc.., but I feel that I experienced true rasa-kAvya
today. Perhaps it says as muchabout me (and perhaps my clan) asthe
works themselves, but I recallonly few other cases that moved me as
much (subject to defects of memory, of course):the initial sarga-s of
sundarakANDa, rati’s lament and pArvati’s rebuff to shiva in disguise in
kumArasambhava, sItA-parityAga in uttarakANDa.As my feeling rose to a
crescendo in response to the climax of the first sarga, I felt quite
ready to drink the blood of a few meccan demons, or at least, check out
bAjIrAv mastAni.

This is an ideal work to present tochildrenof sanskrit-speaking
families. kAlidAsa can wait. But what one can do now is far from clear.
One can emulate the patriot bAlagangAdhara tiLakin his inspiring
writings in the kesarI (but towards the end, even he was broken), or one
cando some rash andstupid thing like the chApekar brothers or …. Can
one be a subhASha-candra, who with all his defects, felled the barbarian
empire, or better yet – can one be shivAji (this time, also thoroughly
dealing with the heart of the problem as well)?
