    By the early sixteenth century, a substantial community of Maratha
    Brahman scholar families had emerged in Mughal Banaras. These
    scholar households mobilized substantial cultural and practical
    resources to address the challenges that ‘early modernity’ posed to
    Brahman communities such as themselves. They provided the locale
    within which reputations were built up and skills passed on.
    Locating their assemblies in the city’s Visvesvara temple, Maratha
    scholar-intellectuals were able to advertise an arena where disputes
    could be resolved and Brahman unity restored. Drawing on older
    universalizing geographies of Brahman identity, they addressed their
    letters of judgement to Brahman communities across the ‘gauḍa’ and
    ‘drāviḍa’ regions of northern and southern India and appealed
    explicitly to a ‘we’ of the pious and discerning, the ‘good people’
    of the Brahman śiṣṭa. This remarkable position of social and
    intellectual leadership emerged very much within the context of the
    Mughal imperial framework. The latter’s gradual disintegration also
    spelled the waning of this remarkable social formation within the
    city, as many of its functions passed to new regional states.

    A consistent theme in recent social histories of early modern India
    has been the opportunities, as well as the challenges, that scribal
    specialists encountered during this era. 1 From the perspective of
    intellectual history too, the early modern centuries have been a
    particular focus of interest. The Sanskrit intellectual cultures of
    this period are now the subjects of an impressive body of
    scholarship. 2 In particular, attention has focussed on contemporary
    intellectuals’ engagement in self-consciously new and often more
    deliberately historical modes of thinking about their disciplines,
    often characterized by contemporaries as ‘navya’, although within a
    broader intellectual culture still deeply committed to ideas of
    continuity and stability. 3 This concern with ‘newness’ has provoked
    much disagreement. 4  
    In terms of social history, there is still much that we do not yet
    know about these Brahman intellectuals and the nature of their
    social authority and ritual entitlements. What did Brahman privilege
    in its various different forms really mean in contemporary social
    terms, and what shifts and negotiations were necessary to maintain
    it? Being able to act and be treated as a Brahman was not only a
    matter of securing due recognition from those who were not Brahmans.
    Just as important, Brahman social authority rested on the ideals of
    unity and community among Brahmans themselves. How did
    contemporaries articulate these ideals in early modern India? 5  
    These are important questions. The early modern centuries, and the
    framework of the Mughal Empire in particular, brought significant
    opportunities for Brahmans. The Mughal demand for cash revenues
    created substantial new advantages for Brahman office holders in the
    revenue systems of regional states, while the expansion of settled
    agriculture benefitted those, often Brahmans, with access to capital
    to undertake its development. Brahman families able to combine
    scribal skills, religious prestige and access to cash were able to
    accumulate substantial property rights in this setting. 6 The
    expansive cultural strategy developed at Akbar’s and at many
    regional courts drew in ambitious and talented Brahmans seeking
    patronage and promoted exchange between them. 7 Improved
    communications implied benefits for many different Brahman
    communities, from lowly priests who serviced north India’s pilgrim
    trades to intellectuals who sought wider audiences for their work
    and sectarian leaders looking to recruit new devotees. 8  
    These same processes contributed to the emergence of Banaras, city
    of Siva, as a destination for hopeful Brahman migrants. The city was
    an unrivalled centre for Sanskrit education, a place where the
    learned could make their reputations with well-connected sponsors
    and the pious could meet wealthy patrons. Banaras also benefitted
    from its Mughal setting at another level. Particularly in matters of
    ritual entitlement and Hindu religious law, its pandit communities
    supplied the moral and judicial authority that some Muslim state
    officials of the period felt themselves unable to do. The latter
    sometimes referred difficult questions of religious law to the city,
    because its ‘pandits’ were the appropriate experts to decide matters
    pertaining to ‘Hindus’. 9 For leading scholar families in the city,
    this meant an opportunity to develop expertises in the practical
    context of disputes brought to them from outside the city. Derrett
    has rightly observed that Banaras’s leading pandit family, the
    Bhattas, were influential because they were willing to apply their
    deep knowledge of religious law to the resolution of practical
    sociopolitical disputes within the Maratha regions and beyond. 10
    Connections of this kind were one of the many different ways in
    which Banaras stood at the centre of what, following Christopher
    Bayly, we might call Mughal India’s Brahman ‘ecumene’. 11  
    But the Mughal milieu also imposed significant strains. Regional
    economic development and new forms of commercialization enabled some
    Brahmans to accumulate wealth and lucrative offices, whereas others
    clung on to petty local priestly roles or remained poor farmers.
    These changes deepened class divides between different Brahman
    communities, often resulting in fission and the creation of new
    sub-castes, of new hierarchies of worth amongst Brahmans themselves.
    This posed an acute challenge for Brahman religious authority. One
    way in which dharma, right action in the world, could be known for
    Brahmans was through the example of the śiṣṭa, the community of the
    learned and well-conducted. 12 At the same time, a person could be
    known as a śiṣṭa only by the fact that his actions were according to
    dharma. As Madhav Deshpande has pointed out, this involved a
    circularity. Sometimes this could be avoided, by maintaining that
    the śiṣṭa were in fact the pious and learned of the ancient world,
    such that their behaviour could be known outside the mutable world
    of the present. 13 But as we shall see, the pandit families of
    Banaras thought of themselves very much as the śiṣṭa in the present.
    This made acrimonious divisions between Brahman sub-castes
    particularly damaging.  
    Brahman communities from the Maratha regions felt these challenges
    acutely. 14 The old religious centres of the Konkan littoral and the
    shrine towns that clustered along the Godavari, Bhima and Krishna
    Rivers clearly offered an environment in which the learned and the
    pious could flourish. Outside these centres, the relatively poor and
    famine-prone agrarian economy of the Deccan Plateau impelled Brahman
    families to diversify, to spread their risks beyond the precarious
    livelihoods to be earned as petty teachers, village priests,
    astrologers or small farmers. In some cases, this meant one or more
    members of the family migrating to Banaras; in others, it meant
    deploying their literate skills in state service and revenue
    administration. These opportunities expanded under the Bahmani kings
    and their successors in the states of the Deccan Sultanate and then,
    of course, within the Maratha state of the warrior king Sivaji. It
    became almost a cliché for seventeenth-century observers, including
    bhakti critics, that what Maratha Brahmans prized above all was
    secure positions in state service.15 These changes were to result in
    deepening divisions of status, wealth and opportunity amongst the
    region’s Brahman communities and unseemly factional struggles that
    reached their climax under the Brahman governments of the
    eighteenth-century Maratha state.  
    As a consequence, in part, of these regional pressures, a
    substantial community of Maratha Brahman scholar families had
    emerged in Banaras by the middle of the sixteenth century. The
    scholar households of the city were able to mobilize substantial
    cultural and practical resources to address these problems of ‘early
    modernity’. Within the household or panditgharāṇa, skills were
    passed to new generations. Locating their assemblies in the city’s
    temple to Visvesvara, Siva in his guise as Lord of All,
    reconstructed probably with patronage from leading lights at Akbar’s
    court, Maratha pandit families were able to advertise an arena where
    disputes could be resolved and Brahman unity restored. The expanding
    conduits of news, discussion and social communication associated
    with the Mughal court and its regional client states facilitated
    these families’ efforts. Drawing on older universalizing geographies
    of Brahman identity in this new Mughal context, they addressed their
    letters of judgement to Brahman communities across the ‘gauḍa’ and
    ‘drāviḍa’ regions of northern and southern India and appealed
    explicitly to a ‘we’ of the pious and discerning, the ‘good people’
    of the Brahman śiṣṭa.  
    This remarkable position of social and intellectual leadership
    exercised from Banaras thus emerged very much within the context of
    the Mughal imperial framework. This also meant, however, that the
    gradual decay and disintegration of that framework and the passing
    of political power to India’s regions from the end of the
    seventeenth century spelled the waning of this remarkable social
    formation within the city.

    The growth of Maratha Brahman dominance in Banaras had some of its
    beginnings in the city’s own changing religious culture. Bakker and
    Isaacson suggested that Qutb al-Din Aibak’s destruction of many of
    the city’s older temples and shrines in 1194 prepared the ground for
    the rise of Banaras as the uniquely favoured city of maraṇamukti,
    where Siva’s teachings, whispered into the ear of the dying, brought
    certain liberation to the soul. 16 The Kāśīkhaṇḍa described the
    ancient king Divodas’s relinquishing of Kasi so that Siva could make
    his home in his beloved city. The purana marks a point in the
    consolidation of this ‘new’ Banaras as the subcontinent’s supreme
    centre of spiritual power and stronghold of Saivite Brahman
    prestige. It described in detail the awe-inspiring temple to
    Visvesvara in the centre of the city, with its four mandapams or
    pavilions: the Aisvarya to the north, the Jnana to the east, the
    Mukti pavilion – beloved home of Siva himself – to the south and the
    Srngara pavilion in front of it. 17 The dating of both the
    Kāśīkhaṇḍa and the Visvesvara temple it celebrates remains
    controversial, although there is clear evidence for the destruction
    of a Visvesvara temple in the first half of the fifteenth century,
    when materials from it appear in nearby Jaunpur. 18  
    The Kāśīkhaṇḍa gained particular depth and resonance from the
    relationships that it described between Kasi and pious people and
    places elsewhere in the subcontinent. The Vedic sage Agastya, with
    his southern associations, occupies a prominent place in the
    narrative. The ‘southern’ direction, dakṣiṇā āśā, was represented in
    a particularly alluring way, the sensuousness of its spice-filled
    airs, its luscious fruits, swelling mountains and charming languages
    causing the gods themselves to linger there. 19 This quickly opened
    the door to regional translations of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa, which promoted
    the consoling attractions of the ‘south’, with its own holy spots,
    from which the pious soul could long for Kasi but without
    experiencing the pains and disappointments that encounters with the
    real city sometimes brought. 20  
    Also adding to the prestige of Banaras was its expanding population
    of scholars, amongst which learned families from the Maratha regions
    came to predominate. External events may have precipitated
    particular waves of migration: the fall of Yadava Devagiri in 1294
    and decline of nearby Paithan as a centre of Brahman learning, the
    catastrophic Deccan famines of the fourteenth and early fifteenth
    centuries and the affluence of Banaras itself during the fifteenth
    century, brought by its close proximity to Jaunpur under the Sharqi
    dynasty. 21 We know quite a lot about the most prominent of the
    Maratha pandit families – Bhattas, Devas, Sesas, Puntambkars,
    Caturdharas, Bharadavajas – who migrated in this way, but less about
    the practicalities of their migrations. 22 These often took place as
    a series of smaller and local moves. Once established in Banaras,
    there were commonly comings and goings over several generations
    before a distinctive ‘Kasi’ branch of the family emerged. In
    addition, Banaras was commonly only one destination for migrant
    families, who might despatch further members to establish themselves
    at other courtly or religious centres flourishing within the Mughal
    imperial framework.  
    The Sesa family provides a good example. 23 The most detailed family
    history that we have traces their origins back to a
    thirteenth-century ancestor, Ramakrsna, who held lands in Nanded, an
    important centre of learning and pilgrimage on the eastern Godavari.
    24 He had three sons, Ganesapant, Vitthalapant and Bopajipant.
    Ganesapant and his descendants remained in Nanded. Descendants of
    Vitthalapant left for Bijapur, and in the 1560s we find one of them,
    Vamanpandit bin Anant Sesa, working as royal librarian to Ali Adil
    Shah I (1558–1580). 25 Vamanpandit’s grandson was the Marathi poet
    Waman Pandit (1608–1695), who spent his youth in Bijapur, but went
    to Banaras for his education in Sanskrit. 26 Another notable
    descendant of the Nanded family was Narasimha Sesa, who moved to the
    Bijapur court, probably in the first half of the sixteenth century.
    His expertise led the pandits at the court to confer on the family
    the title of ‘Bhaṭṭa-bhaṭṭāraka’, ‘revered among scholars’. 27 His
    son was the grammarian Krsna Sesa, who emerged, as we shall see, as
    a prominent leader of the Banaras pandit community by the 1580s.  
    But by this time, other Sesas, probably descendants of Vitthalapant,
    were already well established in Banaras. One Visnu Sesa moved there
    from Nanded, according to the family history, in the later fifteenth
    century. A family story conveys something of the individual ways in
    which such decisions might have been taken and the relationship with
    broader family strategies. Visnu Sesa moved to Banaras for his
    Sanskrit studies after developing a settled dislike of his elder
    brother’s wife, for her scoldings about his study habits. In
    Banaras, he quickly excelled as a grammarian himself, early winning
    the title of sabhāpati, ‘lord of the assembly’, for his outstanding
    performances in debate. 28 It is not clear exactly what the
    relationship was between this branch of the family and the father
    and son Narasimha Sesa and Krsna Sesa mentioned above. If, as seems
    likely, there was a connection, it meant that when Krsna Sesa moved
    to Banaras, he was going not to a city where he would be a stranger,
    but to a place where there was an established network of Sesa
    households, with a reputation as grammarians already developed.
    Moreover, the links between Banaras and Nanded continued. In a
    family document confirming a division of lands in Nanded, dated to
    1629, one Vasudeva Pant Sesa, ‘resident of Kasi’, is a party to the
    document. 29  
    Such continuing connections are evident in the lives of less
    well-known pandits too. Ramacandra, a member of the Jade family of
    Karhade Brahmans from Narwe in the southern Konkan, moved to Banaras
    in the first or second decade of the seventeenth century, following
    a visit of the distinguished philosopher saint of Banaras,
    Bhaskarananda, to the family’s home. By the 1630s, the Jade family
    was appearing in the city’s pandit assemblies. Annotations to the
    catalogue of the extensive library that the family built up reveal
    their continuing interest in the work of scholars back in the
    Konkan. 30 Members of the Arade family of Karhades, also from the
    southern Konkan, migrated south to Karnataka, east to the town of
    Saugor in modern Madhya Pradesh, as well as to Banaras. The family
    was well settled in the city by the 1630s, when the scholar
    Narayanabhatta Arade flourished as a logician and learned
    commentator on dharmaśāstra and kāvya and the family sufficiently
    well established to take part in the pandit assemblies. However,
    Narayanabhatta maintained his links with the south, recording that
    he completed works at Hyderabad in 1640 and at Pune in 1651. 31

    \* Conclusions

    Following the work of Bayly and others, we now have some
    understanding of the place of Banaras and its scholar-intellectuals
    within the Indian ‘ecumene’. 32 Pandits such as Narayanabhatta of
    the Bhatta family during Akbar’s time and Kavindracarya during the
    time of Shah Jahan negotiated with the Mughal court on behalf of
    wider constituencies of the Hindu pious. They maintained good
    connections with the Mughal court, Kavindracarya particularly
    through the relationship he enjoyed with Shah Jahan’s son Dara
    Shukoh. 33 They received addresses of thanks for their services from
    grateful Brahmans in other parts of India. 34 Rulers and sometimes
    pandit communities themselves conferred titles in public recognition
    of conspicuous learning. 35 Honours and rewards were also bestowed
    for success in the public disputations that great men as well as
    rulers staged as a form of prestige entertainment and elite cultural
    patronage. 36 In terms of religious culture, Advaitin views were
    beginning to come to dominate the literate institutions and public
    arenas of the city. 37  
    However, what remains less well explored is the role of the scholar
    household in this quasi ‘public sphere’. 38 Well represented in
    Banaras, the great sectarian maṭhs were themselves powerful centres
    of teaching, learning and scholarly communication. 39 Many sanyasis
    appear as the teachers of scholar pandits in particular disciplines.
    In the sanyasi Kavindracarya, the city found one of its most
    brilliant scholars, teachers and conduits of patronage to the
    learned and pious.40 By the middle of the seventeenth century, as
    Bernier recorded, Rajput patronage founded schools for pupils of the
    elites in the city. 41  
    For most Banaras scholars, however, the household provided the vital
    mainstay of their working lives. It is difficult to find direct
    accounts of the pedagogy of the scholar household. Vedic tradition
    prescribed that a Brahman boy undergo his initiation before joining
    the household of his instructor. This relationship was understood
    very much in filial terms, some texts representing the student quite
    literally as an ‘embryo’ within the teacher’s body. 42 Most students
    seem to have been educated partly within their own households, as we
    saw happening in the Sesa family. Many contemporaries prefaced their
    writings with elaborate tributes to their fathers as teachers:
    Narayanabhatta himself recorded that he had learned all of the
    sastras at the feet of his own father. 43 Fathers sometimes wrote
    texts for the instruction of their sons, as Kamalakarabhatta did
    when he composed a work on mantras for his son Anantabhatta. 44 We
    can think of many lineages where particular disciplines were a
    speciality: the Bhattas and Devas for mīmāṃsā, the Sesas for
    grammar, the Puntamkars for logic. As sons matured, they might write
    alongside their fathers and in some cases complete their works.
    Gagabhatta completed his father’s digest the Dinakaroddyota. 45
    Samkarabhatta edited and added to the work of his father
    Nilakanthabhatta, who was the cousin of Kamalakarabhatta and author
    of major works on religious law. 46 As Benke has described, Krsna
    Sesa very likely completed the Govindārṇava of his father Narasimha.
    47 The intensive ritual work of the householder is likely also to
    have offered opportunities for the education of sons. 48
    Considerable investment thus went into the training of sons, for
    they represented in effect the family’s future intellectual
    capital.  
    Marriage strategies were consequently important for pandit
    households in building up their resources and reputations. When
    Mahadeva Bharadavaja came to Banaras, he married the daughter of the
    Nilakanthabhatta just mentioned and established the Bharadavajas
    thereafter as a leading scholarly family in the city. 49 Sometimes
    marriage relationships with families back in the Maratha regions
    could be equally effective. The Arade family in Banaras, whose
    migrations we followed above, had long established ties with the
    eminent Padhye family of scholars from the Konkan and Pandharpur,
    the Padhyes sending sons to study with Arade teachers in Banaras,
    and the Arades marrying their daughters to Padhye sons. 50  
    But of course students learned in other scholar households beside
    their own. Banaras in this period offered an extraordinary wealth of
    teacherly talent: long settled scholars and recent arrivals, local
    householders and sanyasis from the city’s monastic institutions,
    polymaths and single-discipline specialists. Bhattoji Diksita had
    Krsna Sesa as his teacher in grammar and the prominent
    scholar-sanyasi of Banaras, Narsimhasram, as his teacher in Vedanta.
    51 The poet Nilakantha Sukla had Bhattoji Diksita as his teacher in
    grammar and Bhatta Srimanda in alaṃkāraśāstra. 52 Some
    contemporaries had teachers in many different individual
    disciplines: Nilakantha Caturdhara recorded the names of six, in the
    Vedas, Vedanta, sacrificing, logic, yoga and śrauta. 53  
    Bernier’s well-known description of the ‘private houses’ in which
    most Sanskrit teaching took place in Banaras of the 1660s may
    reflect these accommodative arrangements. The masters were  
    dispersed over different parts of the town in private houses, and
    principally in the gardens of the suburbs, which the rich merchants
    permit them to occupy. Some of these masters have four disciples,
    others six or seven, but this is the largest number. 54  
    Thus in the Sesa household, the great grammarian Bhattoji Diksita
    was a pupil of Krsna Sesa, thus educated in the same household as
    Krsna Sesa’s son Viresvara. Viresvara’s student, the great poet
    Panditaraja Jagannatha, would thus have received his education
    alongside Viresvara’s own son, Cakrapani. 55  
    The scholar household thus included the networks of quasi-filial
    relationships established by teachers and their students. In terms
    of household strategy, this made excellent sense. It widened the
    pool of intellectual talent on which a family could draw for the
    education of its sons. It was an essential component of a scholar’s
    reputation, which depended not only on the works of learning that he
    wrote, but on the numbers of famous students trained by him, and who
    went on to spread his traditions of learning further afield. 56 It
    guarded against the possibility that there might be no sons or sons
    who lacked aptitude for the profession of their fathers.  
    Manuscript libraries were another way in which scholar households
    operated as intellectual and pedagogical concerns. Great libraries
    were naturally associated with royal households and with the maṭhs
    of the ascetic orders. 57 But Maratha scholar-intellectuals in
    Banaras were able to accumulate significant manuscript libraries. In
    March 1651 in Pune, the mobile scholar Narayanabhatta Arade composed
    his Pūjāsāgara, a compendium of correct ritual practices. But he
    apologized for some parts of the work, for, he explained, he was
    away from Banaras and did not have access to all of the works at his
    residence. 58 The Jade family noticed above amassed a very
    substantial library, particularly in works of Advaita Vedanta. The
    early nineteenth-century catalogue to the library suggests that it
    was cross-referenced according to discipline, making it an effective
    intellectual tool for a working scholar. 59  
    Such libraries were part of the family’s capital, intellectual as
    well as material, and a key basis for its livelihood. 60 The work of
    sons and pupils was important, adding to the household’s stock of
    manuscripts by copying new ones or replacing texts worn out through
    use or damaged by careless handling, spillages, the ravages of
    insects, damp and other such enemies of paper documents. 61
    Borrowing and lending texts, often a few manuscript pages at a time,
    was another way of augmenting the household’s collection. 62 Such
    lending was sometimes a source of anxiety and exasperation, of the
    kind that the peshwa Bajirao I (r. 1720–1740) expressed when he
    found that the copy of the Vedabhāsya he had lent was difficult to
    trace, as it had been passed from hand to hand. 63  
    Something of this personal relationship between the text, the
    copyist, the needs of the household and the household’s reputation
    with others emerges in the discourse of the seventeenth-century poet
    saint Ramdas on the study of writing. This discourse included
    detailed guidance on the preparation of good ink and even strokes of
    the pen in forming each Devanagari character, ‘so that a person
    looking at it will think that the whole book, from the first letter
    right to the end, has been written by the same pen’. 64 The young
    were reminded that although their eyes could take in small print,
    the eyes of the old could not, and they should therefore make their
    letters big enough to accommodate the deficiencies of their elders.
    The margins needed to be sufficiently generous so that wear on the
    edges of the pages would not damage the inscribed area. If a
    manuscript was written with this degree of skill and care, ‘people
    will imagine all sorts of things about who could have written it,
    and they will say, “We must see this man”’. 65  
    The unity of the scholar family and its intellectual production also
    came together in matters of law. A very important question for such
    families was that of vidyādhana, ‘gains of learning’. Were the
    earnings of learning and teaching the property of the individual
    scholar, or did such wealth belong to the whole household?
    Nilakantha Bhatta explored this point in hisVyavahāramayūkha,
    written between the second and fourth decades of the seventeenth
    century. The work affirmed the rights of the individual in wealth
    obtained by teaching, by the exhibition of learning or ability in
    disputation or by ‘means of eminent study’. However, reflecting the
    influence in southern India of the scholar-jurist Mitaksara,
    Nilakantha affirmed the jointness of the scholar household’s
    property. Wealth acquired by brothers from learning gained within
    the family, or as the result of the father’s teaching, or acquired
    by one scholar-brother whilst he was being supported by another
    constituted the joint property of the whole family, on which members
    had a claim if the property were to be divided. 66  
    These were not just abstract discussions. In the Sesa family, it is
    striking that of the two brothers Viresvara and Narayana, the former
    is not known to have left any works, whereas the latter found time
    to write. Aryavaraguru speculated that Viresvara’s engagements as a
    teacher took up all his time, and we have noted some of those
    engagements above. 67 Would his earnings have gone to support the
    whole household, including the family of his scholarly brother?
    Family and property rights affected relationships in other ways too.
    In the well-known rivalry between Nilakantha and his cousin
    Kamalakarabhatta, one issue they differed about was the degree of
    ownership that fathers had in their sons. Although Nilakantha had
    emphasized the jointness of the scholar household, he stopped short
    of arguing that this gave rise to any actual right of property in
    sons or in wives. Kamalakarabhatta took a more assertive view of the
    internal dependencies of the extended family. In his great
    compendium the Nirṇayasindhu, he asserted that only a fool could
    think that a man had no rights of ownership in his own son. 68  
    It was also as part of successful extended families that Maratha
    scholar-intellectuals presented themselves in their writings. At the
    start or end of their works, authors described the accomplishments
    of their lineage, acknowledged their debts and advertised their own
    talents. Raghavabhatta, the late fifteenth-century author of a
    commentary on the Śākuntala, described his grandfather
    Ramesvarabhatta, an expert in dialectics, residing in Nasik, on the
    banks of the Godavari, and his father, Prthvidharabhatta, well
    versed in mīmāṃsā and Vedanta. Prthvidharabhatta migrated from Nasik
    to Banaras, where Raghavabhatta was born. Raghavabhatta evidently
    considered himself a worthy scion of the house, for he described
    himself as an expert in Vedanta, logic, mīmāṃsā, mathematics,
    medicine, erotics, music and other arts. 69 The colophons of pupils
    were equally effective in advertising the merits of the
    scholar-intellectual, as the Maratha scholar Raghunatha Navahastha
    made clear in the eulogies to his teacher Anantadeva that appear in
    many of his works. 70  
    Families displayed themselves together in person too. As we shall
    see, fathers and sons, teachers and their students appeared together
    in the ‘public’ forum of pandit assemblies. Scholar-brothers might
    attend competitive public debates together. Bhattoji Diksita and his
    brother Rangojibhatta went to the Ikkeri court of Venkatappa Nayaka
    I (1595–1629), where they defeated a Madhva ascetic in debate and
    received many honours. 71 The award of titles to individuals
    sometimes had a public afterlife for their families. Visnu Sesa’s
    title of sabhāpati and Narasimha Sesa’s title of bhaṭṭa-bhaṭṭārākar
    continued to be enjoyed in person by the Sesas after his death. 72  
    What we can glimpse into other aspects of the life of the household,
    of course, is only fragmentary. Deshpande suggests that these
    families may have spoken Marathi at home, with a Hindi dialect for
    communicating with neighbours, and Sanskrit itself as the language
    of learning. 73 We do not know how far they shared the same hearth.
    Krsna Sesa had a brother, Cintamani, and his two sons, Viresvara and
    Narayana, noted above. They, their parents, their wives and children
    would very likely have occupied the same family home, perhaps in a
    wada, the old-style mansion built around a courtyard that was a
    typical form of domestic architecture in Maharashtra of the period.
    74 But would the four sons of Samkarabhatta, grandson of the first
    Bhatta to move to Banaras, have continued to live in the same
    household? At some point, of course, such households would need to
    have divided, with implications for division of family property and
    many other formerly joint arrangements.  
    The family history written by this Samkarabhatta demonstrates many
    strategies of the migrant scholar household. 75 In the first decade
    of the sixteenth century, his grandfather Ramesvarabhatta moved from
    Paithan some 80 miles west to Sangamner, where he set up as a
    teacher. Failing to have a son, he and his wife went to Kolhapur to
    worship the family deity, but they took his students with him. The
    visit was successful and, convinced that she was carrying a son who
    would be a great scholar, the family went on to Krsnadevaraya’s
    Vijayanagar to see its wealth of learning. Their son,
    Narayanabhatta, was born in 1513, but he developed consumption. So
    the family, again along with Ramesvara’s students, went to Dwarka
    for a cure. Here, Ramesvara spent some time training a local student
    to carry on his own intellectual traditions in that city. From there
    Ramesvara returned to Paithan. After some 3 or 4 years in the city,
    he and his household left for Banaras, where they settled. Here, the
    remarkable Bhatta dynasty emerged. Outstanding scholars in many
    disciplines emerged from the next four generations of sons and
    cousins, whose working lives spanned the middle of the sixteenth
    century to the end of the seventeenth. 76  
    However, Samkarabhatta made it clear that the quasi-filial
    connections between leading members of the Bhatta family and their
    pupils were equally important as a measure of his family’s success.
    He describes how famous scholars came from Dravida, Gurjara,
    Kanyakubja, Malwa, Braja, Mithila, the Himalayan regions, Karnata,
    Utkala, the Konkan, Gauda, Andhra, Mathura, Kamarupa and other parts
    of India came to learn with his father and grandfather. 77  
    The scholar household was thus a mainstay in the lives of Banaras’s
    Maratha intellectuals. What made possible the brilliant achievements
    of so many of their members during the sixteenth and seventeenth
    centuries was precisely that corporate and familial dimension of
    their lives which we, perhaps, do not often associate with
    individual intellectual distinction. The household provided an
    exceptionally high degree of specialized training and accumulation
    of expertise, very much in the same way that heritable craft
    specializations produced outstanding levels of skill in other areas
    of the early modern Indian economy. 78 In Mughal Banaras, there was
    a unique concentration of such households, linked by ties of family,
    migration and pedagogy to Brahman communities elsewhere in India,
    creating a critical mass, which multiplied in its effects.  
    The scholar household in this setting was not a ‘private’ sphere in
    any simple sense, contrasted with the ‘public’ of the city and its
    political and intellectual life. 79 It was part of a wider network
    of pedagogy which itself constituted an important dimension of the
    Brahman ‘ecumene’. In many ways, it was an ideal milieu for students
    to acquire the deep disciplinary expertises and intellectual
    confidence that the training of the household could provide, but in
    a setting of considerable intellectual and cultural heterogeneity.
    Here, shifting populations of mobile scholars, seekers of
    enlightment, ritual specialists, travelling ascetics and pilgrims
    could open up wider horizons for students and prompt them to ask new
    questions about established bodies of knowledge, their intellectual
    underpinnings and their relation to one another and to the pressures
    and dilemmas of the present. Such might have been the context, at
    least, in which the scholar-intellectuals of early modern Banaras
    and their compeers at centres elsewhere in India wielded their
    remarkable disciplinary skills, but for the purposes of reappraisal
    and critique, in some cases, of the foundations of those disciplines
    themselves.

    From their vantage point in Banaras, how did these scholar families
    view Brahman communities in other parts of India? 80Around the end
    of the first millennium, there seems to have begun a gradual move to
    develop a classification of regions as markers of Brahman origins
    and affiliation, in addition to the older identifiers of family
    śākhā or branch of Vedic study andgotra or exogamous lineage unit.
    81 Certain geographical concepts emerged with especial significance.
    Dākśiṇātya, ‘southerner’, seems to have been an important and
    perhaps prestigious identifier for many Maratha pandits. It was
    associated with the old centres of Brahman learning on the Godavari
    and other rivers of central southern India, perhaps seen from the
    vantage point of Mughal Banaras as the pristine remains of older
    traditions of small town scholarship and piety that had remained
    untouched by the sometimes uncomfortable compromises of the present.
    82 Many scholars described themselves as ‘southerners’ in this way.
    83 Some part of Narayanabhatta’s reputation depended on his
    consistent advocacy of the intellectual traditions of ‘the south’.
    84 An important part of these lay in the distinctive Mitaksara
    approach to family law, as we have seen in the compendium of family
    law, the Vyavahāramayūkha, compiled by Narayanabhatta’s son
    Nilakantha.  
    Dakśiṇātya scholars in Banaras were numerous enough to attract
    hostile comment. The Kanyakubja Brahman Dhiresvara Misra was teacher
    in logic to Nīlakaṇṭha Caturdhara. In his compendium the
    Dvijarājodaya, ‘Rise of the kingdom of the twice-born’, composed
    about 1630, he made a series of sarcastic attacks on what he called
    the navīnadākṣiṇātyāḥ, the ‘new southerner’ or ‘southerners’.
    Sometimes he referred to these, perhaps with some irony, as the
    dākṣiṇātyaśiṣṭammanyāḥ, ‘the southerners who fancy themselves
    learned’. 85 It may be possible to see here the resentment of a
    Kanyakubja Brahman for the collective esprit de corps of the city’s
    dākṣiṇātya Brahmans, who seemed to think of themselves very much as
    the learnedśiṣṭa of the contemporary world.  
    As we shall see, however, both Brahmans in the city and those in the
    regions who looked to the learned in Banaras for the resolution of
    disputes sought to develop a more comprehensive classification of
    the mobile Brahman communities of the subcontinent and one without
    particular regional partialities. By the end of the first
    millennium, we begin to see evidence of such a classification based
    on the notion that there were pañca gauḍa or ‘five northern’ and
    pañca drāviḍa, ‘five southern’ communities of Brahmans.  
    How did this classification arise? ‘Gauḍa’ we know variously is the
    name of the ancient kingdom of Gauḍa in West Bengal, the country in
    which Bengali is spoken, and as a collective name for the eastern
    regions of India. 86 Generic territorial names were often a
    combination of cultural and linguistic regions together with
    elaborate classifications on the basis of numbers: the ‘fifty-six
    countries’ of India, the ‘seven Koṅkaṇas’ of the Konkan region, the
    ‘five drāviḍas’ said to be part of the realm ruled by the Colas, the
    ‘three Kaliṅgas’ of the old Kalinga empire in central eastern India.
    87  
    As Whitney Cox has suggested, however, these territorial names could
    be recruited to new uses, to describe peoples rather than
    territories, and in a more deliberately systematizing way. 88
    Perhaps significantly, given their location between north and south,
    the earliest uses of the pañca gauḍa and pañca drāviḍa
    classification together seem to be from the Maratha regions. A
    Rastrakuta grant of 926 CE from the town of Samyana in the northern
    Konkan describes the gifting of revenues for the feeding of nine
    persons belonging to the pañca gauḍīya mahā parisad, the ‘great
    assembly of the five gauḍas’ settled in the town. 89  
    The most widely circulated early reference to the pañca gauḍa/pañca
    drāviḍa formulation together is in western Maharashtra’s ‘purana of
    place’, the Sahyādrikhaṇḍa. 90 This purana describes the god
    Parasurama’s settlement of the region with its many different
    Brahman communities. In the context of a discussion about the
    origins of Chitpavan Brahmans, Skanda asks Mahadev to explain the
    10-fold division of Brahmans. Mahadev’s reply is interesting because
    it indicates that although the classification itself was recognized,
    which Brahmans actually belonged to each grouping was still
    indeterminate:  
    The Drāviḍās, Telaṅgās, Karnātās, Madhyadeśas and Gurjaras are the
    pañca drāviḍas. The Sāraswatās, Kānyakubjās, Utkalās, Maithilās and
    Gauḍā are the pañca gauḍas. These are the ten kinds of Brahmans.
    Similarly, some say that the pañca gauḍas consist of the Trihotrās,
    Agnivaiśyās, Kānyakubjās, Kanojyās and Maitrāyanās. All these
    divisions of Brahmans were made by the rishis. Throughout this wide
    land, each of them follows the practices of their own countries.
    91  
    Mahadev hastened to add that nonetheless all shared the
    distinguishing marks that united all Brahmans. ‘All of these
    Brahmans have the gayatri mantra, and they have their rituals said
    with Vedic mantras. They all have the same six karmas.’ 92  
    An inscription of CE 1425, in the Virinchipuram temple in the
    northern Arcot district, records the proceedings of an assembly of
    Brahmans. Although it does not allude to the ‘five drāviḍas’, it
    does show the way in which affiliations of gotra and śākhāpersisted
    alongside this emerging vocabulary of regional affiliations for
    Brahmans. The Brahmans who signed the document committed themselves
    neither to give, nor to take, money at the marriage of a daughter.
    ‘According to this, if the Brahmans of this kingdom of Paḍaivīḍu,
    Kaṇṇaḍigas, Tamiṛas, Teluṅgas, Ilāḷas, of all gotras, sūtras and
    śākhās conclude a marriage, they shall, from this day forward, do it
    by kanyādāna.’ 93 Regional identifications of this kind for Brahmans
    were commonplace by this period.  
    But what ‘work’ did the more specific classification of ‘five gauḍa’
    and ‘five drāviḍa’ communities of Brahmans do, over the long period
    of its development? Madhav Deshpande suggested a link with earlier
    phases of Brahman migration south of the Vindhyas. It provided a
    framework for what were often fierce political battles that
    continued into the early modern period, to explain the cultural
    differences between Brahman communities of different regions, to
    include some within the ambit of approved Brahman identities and to
    exclude others. 94 Further research is needed into the uses of this
    classification in other regions of India. However, it is possible
    too that it emerged earliest and most clearly among Brahmans of the
    Maratha regions precisely because these regions lay between ‘north’
    and ‘south’, making it particularly important for these Brahmans to
    establish a clear geography of Brahman identity within which their
    own communities could be located.  
    The Maratha scholar-intellectuals of sixteenth- and
    seventeenth-century Banaras and their constituencies in the regions
    were active players in the development of the classification. As we
    shall see, for Brahmans back in the Maratha country who took their
    disputes to Banaras, the clear grid of regional affiliations
    represented in the pañca gauḍa/pañca drāviḍa conception was
    attractive because it offered the chance to anchor local and perhaps
    precarious identities within a framework that aspired, at least, to
    be recognized across the subcontinent. For the pandit assemblies
    themselves, the classification provided an authoritative grid onto
    which they could map the place of every local Brahman community. It
    offered an extremely useful tool in determining what and who a
    Brahman was and in bringing cohesion to the fractious communities
    who claimed that status for themselves.  
    The pañca gauḍa/pañca drāviḍa conception also came to fulfil an
    important judicial role. It suggested both comprehensiveness of
    representation among the assemblies of Brahmans brought together to
    consider questions of ritual authority and religious law and the
    broad Brahman audiences to which they addressed their findings. In
    this sense, one might almost see this conception, articulated from
    Siva’s own city, as a Brahman version of the tour d’horizon
    contained in the royaldigvijaya, enumerating all of the different
    regional Brahman communities of the subcontinent claimed as a part
    of its unifying sociological framework. Brought to bear in the new
    communicative spaces of Mughal India, this older universalizing
    geography of the Sanskrit cosmopolitan sphere enabled the assemblies
    to present themselves as something like an all-India deliberative
    Brahman ‘public’.  
    The Banaras assemblies and their appeals gave a powerful forward
    impulse to the wider currency of the pañca gauḍa andpañca drāviḍa
    conception. By 1749, for example, we find the concept invoked at the
    Satara court as a means of demarcating the ritual entitlements of
    Brahmans from those of their kāyastha rivals. 95 We saw above the
    ties of teaching and marriage that linked the Arade family of
    Banaras with the Padhyes of the Konkan. In 1756, the Padhye brothers
    were locked in bitter dispute at the peshwa’s court in Pune over
    their rights to priestly office in the Konkan. The brothers
    demanded: ‘Let us you and we sit down together in front of the five
    draviḍas, and talk of the justice in this case.’ 96 The
    classification also entered popular traditions of narrative poetry,
    appearing in the kathā of one Anand, whose poem about the rise of
    Citpavan Brahmans was performed at the Satara court in 1820. 97 By
    the start of the nineteenth century, in colonial and Indian
    commentaries alike, the categories of pañca gauḍa and pañca drāviḍa
    had become the standard way of classifying the subcontinent’s
    Brahman communities. 98

    Let us turn now to Visvesvara temple in Banaras, which the pandit
    assemblies advertised as the location for their meetings. The temple
    was rebuilt during Akbar’s time, probably during the 1570s or 1580s,
    under the leadership of Narayanabhatta of the Bhatta family. 99 I
    have argued elsewhere that the temple followed the earlier cruciform
    layout described in theKāśīkhaṇḍa. 100 The traveller Jean Baptiste
    Tavernier, touring in India between 1638 and 1643, described ‘the
    pagoda of Benares, which, after that of Jagannath, is the most
    famous in all India, and of equal sanctity’. It was built in the
    form of a cross, with four equal arms, in the middle of which  
    a lofty dome rises like a kind of tower with many sides terminating
    in a point, and at the end of each arm of the cross another tower
    rises, which can be ascended from outside. Before reaching the top
    there are many niches and several balconies, which project to
    intercept the fresh air; and all over the tower there are rudely
    executed figures in relief of various kinds of animals. 101  
    As Michell has suggested, the temple so constructed illustrates the
    way in which Mughal building techniques could be brought into the
    service of Hindu ritual requirements. 102  
    Visiting the city in September 1632, the traveller and commercial
    prospector Peter Mundy went inside the temple  
    where, in the middle, on a place elevated, is a stone in forme like
    a Hatters blocke plaine and unwrought, as per the figure; on which
    they that resort powre water of the River, flowres, rice, Butter,
    which here (by reason of the heat) is most comonly liquid, whilest
    the Bramane reads or sayes something which the Vulgar understands
    not. Over it hanges a Canopie of Silke and about it severall Lampes
    lighted. 103  
    Tavernier also ventured inside, where he saw many other deities,
    which suggest a broad and inclusive religious culture for the
    temple: ‘Bainmadou’, Visnu in his guise as Veni Madhava, lord of the
    junction of the three sacred rivers, Ganges, Yamuna and Sarasvati,
    which meet together at Prayag; the massive gold figure of Visnu’s
    mount, Garuda; and Murlidhara, Krsna playing the flute. 104  
    The central Asian traveller Maḥmūd Balkhī, who toured north India
    between 1624 and 1631, noted the bustle and crowds of pilgrims
    visiting what he called ‘the temple of Lala Bir Singh’:  
    This temple is situated in the heart of Banaras, and is made of
    stone and brick. Its height is 130 zira (yards) and the interior
    circumference is one hundred zira (yards), consisting of wonderful
    aspects and high verandahs. Outside this grand and matchless
    building are a school, a worship house, an inn, about 80 houses in
    all, fully occupied and engaged. Although the worship was coming to
    an end, the men and women were dispersing, nearly thirty thousand
    women and men together and close (to each other) were present on
    that unique place. Orators, reciters of holy books, dominis, and all
    the administrators of affairs and others were present. Everyone
    stayed with their respective guides. Due to the large crowd and the
    ecstasy due to religious songs, it was difficult to keep one’s
    bearing there. 105  
    The charismatic deities of the temple were beginning to attract the
    attention of Rajput rulers anxious to associate themselves with its
    power. At some point in the decades after the rebuilding of the
    1580s, the Visvesvara temple may have benefitted from the
    beneficence of Vir Singh Bundela, ruler of Orccha between 1605 and
    1627, for here we see Maḥmūd Balkhī describing it as the temple of
    ‘Lala Bir Singh’. 106  
    Raja Jai Singh of Amer also established close links with the temple.
    He built a school attached to it for the education of children of
    noble families. 107 He also constructed a shrine to house Parvati,
    consort of Siva, in her form of Annapurna, goddess of nourishment
    and food and a presiding deity of Banaras. This deity, Tavernier
    tells us, had formerly been in the Visvesvara temple itself, but
    ‘the Raja desiring to have this idol in the pagoda of his house and
    to remove it from the great pagoda, has expended in gifts to the
    Brahmans and in alms to the poor more than 500,000 rupees, which
    make 750,000 livres of our money’. Newly adorned with jewels and
    pearls, the goddess stood in a specially constructed shrine attached
    to the Raja’s house. 108  
    What do we know about the Muktimandapam itself, where the pandit
    assemblies described themselves as meeting? Its name suggests a
    peculiar sacred quality: in the city itself of mukti, liberation,
    this is the liberation’s own pavilion. Let us go back to the
    Kāśīkhaṇḍa, because for his late sixteenth-century guide to Kasi,
    the Tristalīsetu, Narayanabhatta reproduced much of theKāśīkhaṇḍa’s
    fourteenth-century description. 109 Having described the whole
    temple as the place of his greatest happiness and beautiful abode of
    his sports, Siva goes on to the Muktimandapam itself. ‘To the south
    thereof is the abode of the glory of salvation, my pavilion. I stay
    there always. That is my hall of assembly, sadomaṇḍapa.’ 110  
    After reproducing Siva’s description of the extraordinary merits
    that pilgrims would gain by actions performed in the pavilion,
    Narayanabhatta departed from the text of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa and inserted
    his own lines, perhaps to re-emphasize the associations of the
    pavilion with discussions in matters of religious law: ‘Because one
    can worship in the pavilion of liberation, and converse on matters
    of dharma there, as well as listen to the Puranas, a man who is a
    receptacle of dharma should live in Kasi.’ 111 Narayanabhatta’s text
    then returned to the Kāśīkhaṇḍa for his description of the other
    three pavilions. But it was the Muktimandapam, the ‘southern’
    pavilion, whose prestige and spiritual potency shine out most in
    these passages that he reproduced. The suggestion of ‘southern’
    authorship for the Kāśīkhaṇḍa can only be speculative. What is
    certain, however, is that by the time of Narayanabhatta, the
    ‘southern’ pavilion was acquiring associations with a new kind of
    ‘southern’ prestige, in the southern or dakśinātya origins of many
    of the learned scholars who were coming to dominate the assemblies
    held there.  
    Perhaps most interestingly, the Muktimandapam seems to have been
    familiar to Brahman audiences outside the city.
    TheVāḍeśvarodaya-kāvya, by one Visvanatha, of the Pitre family of
    Karhade Brahmans from the Konkan, was completed in the third or
    fourth decade of the seventeenth century. 112 The work celebrated
    the temple to Vadesvara, family deity of many Chitpavan Brahmans, at
    Guhagar in the Ratnagiri district of the Konkan. Amongst the many
    stories he told, Visvanatha described how pandits in the sacred
    Muktimandapam at Banaras had held investigations to determine
    whether the presence of the gods in the great peaks of the Sahyadri
    range transformed those peaks into gold, as a Suta or teller of
    puranic histories had told them. Was śabdaprāmāṇya, the authority of
    the puranic scriptures, greater than that of pratyakṣaprāmāṇya, the
    authority of evidence that could be seen? A messenger was despatched
    to find out. The mountains, when he got there, were made of ordinary
    earth. But the lump of soil he carried back with him to show his
    masters in Banaras was transformed into gold as soon as it came
    within the boundaries of the city. After seeing it, the doubters in
    the Muktimandapam found their confidence in the truths of the
    eternal Vedas restored – and happily, perhaps, the authority of the
    sastras and the truths of visual evidence to be at one.

    It was thus very much in the setting of Mughal Banaras, with its
    links with the Mughal court, and with its elite culture of Rajput
    patronage and pious public building, that the Maratha
    scholar-intellectuals were able to find a place of such grandeur for
    their meetings. The form of their assemblies was straightforward: it
    was the standard dharmasabhā or pariṣad of learned Brahmans called
    to settle disputes or prescribe penances in matters of religious
    law. 113 The disputes brought to them were very much the local
    consequences of the wider pressures of ‘early modernity’ discussed
    at the start of this essay.  
    Devarukhe or Devarsi Brahmans and their relations with the Citpavan
    community in the Konkan were the subject of an ongoing struggle.
    Devarsis who had migrated to Banaras were successful, indeed
    prestigious ritual specialists. However, their caste-fellows who had
    remained behind in the Konkan were locked in a dispute with their
    Citpavan Brahman neighbours, which seems to have had its origins in
    the Devarukhes’ refusal to work as labourers for their wealthier
    Citpavan neighbours.114 A Marathi letter of 1583 sent from Banaras
    back to the Konkan reported that the pandit assembly held in the
    Muktimandapam to discuss the matter had urged reconciliation:  
    All this community of Brahmanas (he samasta brāhmana), the
    Chiplunas, Devarsis and Maharastras, have the same vedic karmas
    (samāna vaidika karmi) and that there is authority for sharing of
    food together. It was also agreed that Brahmans should not conduct
    hostilities with each other. This much was agreed by common
    consent.  
    The judgement concluded with a reminder of the solemn prestige of
    the assembly’s meeting place: ‘He who says that there should not be
    exchange of food, let him be brought to the place of Sri
    Visvesvara.’ 115  
    Senvis or Saraswat Brahmans, communities of successful trading
    people, farmers and administrative servants of the Portuguese, the
    East India Company and the local states of the Konkan littoral, were
    the subject of repeated attack, particularly from Karhade Brahmans,
    for their livelihoods as traders and farmers and for the fact that
    they ate fish. Hence, the Karhades argued that Saraswats were not
    eligible for all of the six karmas or ritual duties and entitlements
    that distinguished a Brahman.  
    Again, the Banaras pandit assemblies urged unity, describing
    themselves in remarkably authoritative and expansive terms. In
    Visvesvara’s own city, ‘the whole community of the excellent pañca
    drāviḍas, that is to say, Dravidas, Andras, Karnatakas, Maharastras
    and Gurjaras’ had met, ‘in the Muktimandapam of Srisvami’s temple’.
    They sent their greetings to ‘the pañca drāviḍas and pañca gauḍas
    who live in the region of the Sahyadri mountains of the Dakṣiṇa
    Desa’. Their judgement was that the Senvis or Saraswats of the
    region were in fact ‘eastern Brahmans of the pañca gauḍa community’.
    In eating fish, they were simply following the prescriptions of
    Parasuram, who allowed all those who came to settle in the Konkan to
    follow their long-established customs. The assembly concluded with a
    reminder of their status: ‘This is the opinion of the śiṣṭa.’ 116  
    In 1657, the scholar families of Banaras again found the question of
    the Devarukhes before them. The stakes in the very large assembly
    that met to consider it were particularly high because some Brahman
    families in the city had themselves contracted marriage
    relationships with the Devarukhes, or ‘Devarsis’ as they were known
    in the city. Hence the assembly was vehement in its defence of the
    community:  
    They are of the nature that they can perform Vedic sacrifices on
    their own behalf and on behalf of others, they purify the line in
    which they dine, they are worthy people as family relations, and are
    of the nature of being absolutely excellent Brahmins. And it is
    decided that the śiṣṭa do have family relations with them.  
    Dire consequences would follow any disagreement: ‘Anyone who speaks
    against this decision, reached by the wise, is a desecrator of the
    god Visvanath and a murderer of Brahmins.’ 117  
    We do not know whether this dispute came from outside Banaras,
    perhaps from critics back in the Maratha regions, or from local
    malcontents such as the Kanyakubja Brahman Dhiresvara. But the
    suggestion that Devarsis were less than excellent Brahmans struck at
    the heart of the scholar household as a social as well as an
    intellectual enterprise. If, as the judgement above suggests, some
    leading families had contracted marriages with Devarsis, any taint
    would spread to all of their social relationships. Nor could this
    have remained merely a ‘social’ matter. Any question over the pandit
    household’s social reputation would have been likely to affect the
    networks of teaching and co-residence so central to its livelihood
    and reputation. Even more important, such questions about the social
    standing of the household might well have spread to affect
    perceptions of the intellectual work carried on within it.  
    This helps us to make sense of the remarkable assembly of pandits
    who met to consider the question. 118 Maratha pandit families
    therefore made up the core of those attending, 23 of the 77
    signatories to its judgement identifiable as Maratha Brahmans. In
    these signatures, it is also the extended scholar family that stands
    out. Members of the Bhatta, Sesa, Deva and other Maratha pandit
    families were present, alongside an extraordinary array of other
    scholars and intellectuals, householders and ascetics, from the
    Maratha country, from Bengal and from southern India.

    Within a few years of this meeting, however, the world of these
    scholar-intellectuals began to undergo profound changes. With the
    execution in 1659 of Dara Shukoh, a key link between the Banaras
    pandit communities and the Mughal court disappeared. A decade later
    in 1669–1670, for reasons that are not clearly understood, Aurangzeb
    ordered the Visvesvara temple to be pulled down, along with the
    Vaisnava temple at Mathura, and important parts of the temple at
    Vrandavan. 119With the emperor embarking on a protracted struggle
    with his Maratha adversaries in the Deccan, and their prestigious
    meeting place reduced to rubble beneath a mosque placed
    conspicuously atop its visible remnants, the political climate of
    Banaras turned increasingly adverse for the city’s Maratha pandit
    families. 120 Scholars from the Bhatta and Deva families in
    particular moved to associate themselves with Sivaji’s court at
    Raigad in the Maratha regions. As is well known, pandits from these
    families played a central role in his consecration as a royal
    dharmic king in 1674. 121  
    This was a prescient move. If the Mughal imperial framework had
    helped bring into being the remarkable Brahman social formation
    studied here, the fragmentation and decay of that framework and the
    shifting of political as well as judicial power to Maharashtra’s
    regions were also to mean the gradual passing of many of this
    formation’s judicial and intellectual functions from Banaras to the
    regions too. Within the Mughal context, Maratha scholar pandits had
    benefitted from the disjunction between the royal authority of
    Muslim courts in north India and authority in matters of Hindu
    religious law. The city’s intellectuals were to some extent able to
    step into this gap and to provide mediation and judicial expertise
    in a wide range of disputes without the benefit of close support
    from Hindu royal authority. Their vantage point in Siva’s own city
    may have had a special aptness in this particular context. As noted
    above, one of the central narrative themes of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa
    described the evacuation of royal power from the city so that Siva
    could make his abode there. However, the rise of the Maratha empire
    created in effect conditions for a re-attachment of Brahman
    authority to the royal power of ‘Hindu’ states in the new courts of
    western India, whose ministers early evinced a determination to
    build up their own textual resources and local expertise in matters
    of religious law. 122 This development was to erode the position of
    Banaras and its scholar-intellectuals and to shift many of their
    functions to Pune, Satara, Kolhapur, Tanjore and Baroda and, in the
    eighteenth century, to the courts of a new generation of expansive
    Rajput courts with their own ritual ambitions. 123 It was the Pune
    court that now inherited the task of mediating conflicts between
    Maharashtra’s Brahman communities and of pressing and persuading all
    of them to adhere to common norms of conduct appropriate to the
    śiṣṭa. 124  
    However, these eighteenth-century changes should not allow us to
    overlook the strategic effectiveness with which the scholar
    households discussed in this essay capitalized on the opportunities
    that the Mughal imperial framework brought them in Banaras. The
    intellectuals of these households carried older regional geographies
    through into the ‘ecumene’ of early modern India to construct a new
    kind of arena within which the strains of ‘early modernity’ could be
    mediated and deflected. They contributed substantially to the
    systematization of the Brahman community identities examined here in
    ways that set the terms for colonial classifications. Their close
    familiarity with Deccan society meant that their writings in the
    field of dharmasastra – Kamakalarabhatta’s Nirṇayasindhu and his
    cousin Nilakanthabhatta’s Vyavahāramayūkha – remained definitive
    texts throughout the colonial period, enshrining their conceptions
    of ritual entitlement, family relationships and property rights.
    Carried into the Maratha country and beyond, their ritual expertise
    helped to secure the authority of a new generation of regional
    states in the eighteenth century and to ensure that the morals and
    law of the dharmasastras found a central place within them. As
    Minkowski has described, these pandit communities of the sixteenth
    and seventeenth centuries were equally influential in the realm of
    theology. They laid the intellectual foundations of the modernized
    ‘big-tent’ Advaitic Hinduism that later came to be something like
    the ‘establishment position’ in India’s religious culture during the
    colonial period and after. 125  
    Whatever the complexity of their intellectual approaches to
    innovation in their own disciplines, these scholars were highly
    inventive in their practical engagements with the novel
    opportunities and pressures of their own times. They were adept at
    finding ways to protect the principles of Brahman unity and Brahman
    privilege and to give these principles new force and social
    relevance. If, as some historians suggest, the eighteenth century
    was to see the emergence of a ‘Brahman Raj’ in India that lasted
    through the colonial period, some of its most important foundations
    were laid in the scholar households of Banaras in the preceding two
    centuries. 126

    predate the Muslim invasions and expressed the imperial ambitions of
    the eleventh-century Kalacuri kings and the Saiva Siddhanta cults
    with which they were associated. Bakker, ‘Construction and

    Ancient’. See also Kṛtyakalpataru of Bhaṭṭa Lakṣmīdhara,
    introduction by Aiyangar, pp. lxxxv–lxxxvi, for a twelfth-century
    description of Banaras which does not mention the Kāśīkhaṇḍa or a
    great Visvesvara temple. Smith suggested a deliberate omission by
    its author, minister to the Gahadavalas who had displaced the
    Kalacuris and patronized different Saiva institutions.  
    19. Tagare’s English translation of the Kāśīkhaṇḍa suggests that the
    author may himself have been a southerner: Tagare, Kāśī-Khaṇḍa,
    Pūrvārdha, 10–11, n. 1. Smith’s suggestion of a Kalacuri imperial
    association for the Kāśīkhaṇḍa would certainly help explain its
    ‘southern’ themes, because the Kalacuris themselves had important
    links with central and southern India. I thank Travis Smith for
    helpful exchanges on these themes.

    Chalukya king Jayasimha III described his triumphs: ‘the eradication
    of the Cola, the mighty overlord of the five drāviḍas, the
    requisition of the treasure of the lords of the seven Koṅkaṇas’.

    the Skanda Purāṇa, published in 1877. The purana was probably in
    existence by the twelfth century, because fragments are quoted in
    the Caturvargacintāmaṇi of Hemadri, minister of the Yadava king
    Mahadeva: Hemadri, Caturvargacintāmaṇi, vol. 1, 718–9; vol. 3, 306.
    We do not know, however, when these particular verses of the purana
    were written. See Levitt, ‘The Sahyādrikhaṇḍa: Some Problems’.

    Styles’, 80; and Gutschow, Banaras, 34. Michell questions the link
    with the Kāśikhaṇḍa’s structure. However, this may be a misreading
    of Prinsep’s 1827 reconstructed ground plan of the temple, which
    shows a cruciform construction of four mandapams, as described in
    the Kāśikhaṇḍa. Prinsep’s plan is reproduced in Altekar, Banaras,

    109. It is likely that he composed this work after the temple
    rebuilding, because he implies that visiting pilgrims would see a
    new liṅga: ‘though here the liṅga of Visvesvara is removed and
    another is brought in its place by human beings, owing to the times,
    the pilgrims must worship whatever liṅga is in this place’.
