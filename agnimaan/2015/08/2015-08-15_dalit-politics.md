Dalit politics

-   Before independence, they were led by some prominent anti-hindu
    British agents (Ambedkar, Periyar)

-   Culturalorientations
    -   Mangled discourse
        -   “Hinduism is a synthesis of indigenous tribal practices and
            belief systems and grew bottom-up, incorporating the
            numerous pagan practices of Dalits and tribal communities
            over millennia. …However, the distorted academic & public
            discourse created an impression that Hinduism is synonymous
            to Brahmanism (unlike the distinction, which even Ambedkar
            made), caste-system is a religious system and that Dalits
            are not
            Hindus.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
    -   As a holdover from the early days, we see in many cases an undue
        influence of the Christian church, and anti-hinduism.
        -   “Buddhism was promoted as well but failed to find serious
            takers outside Mahars of
            Maharashtra.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
    -   Growth of the consciousness of the ‘Hindu unity’ in the modern
        sense i.e., Hindutva
        -   Reimagination of Hinduism
            -   “So, the anti-Hinduism propaganda had an effect but an
                effect, which was quite opposite to what was intended.
                It enabled Dalits to reject the upper-caste supremacy
                and instead re-imagine and re-create their own space
                within the Hindu fold. …Most of the Dalits happily
                remained attached to their Hindu traditions, rituals and
                festivals. What happened instead was the decline of
                ritual power & legitimacy of the upper castes,
                especially Brahmins. In truth, resentment has always
                been more against the ‘existing’ caste-system,
                discrimination and caste inequalities rather than
                against mythological constructs and ancient
                scriptures.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
        -   Erosion of caste antagonism
            -   “Moreover, for the section of Dalits which benefited
                from reservations, rising wealth, and opportunities in
                the post-reform period, caste discrimination is
                increasingly not the dominant reality of the everyday
                life. This has reduced the caste antagonism and
                consequently the space of anti-Hinduism
                rhetoric.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
        -   Sanskritization
            -   “Sanskritization due to works done by several Hindu &
                Hindutva organisations like opening of temples to
                Dalits, imparting scriptural knowledge, performing yagna
                and other sanskara for Dalits, training Dalit priests,
                anti-caste advocacy
                etc”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).e
        -   Ritual changes
            -   “Perhaps the best example would be of many Dalits
                mentioning their ‘vansa’/clan name or sub-caste during
                Sankalpa (where one is supposed to speak aloud his name
                and lineage) while performing religious rituals or puja
                in temples instead of Gotra (male lineage from mostly
                Brahmin ancient Rishis) and being accepted as such by
                the mostly Brahmin
                priests.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
        -   Threat of Islamist aggression
            -   “Apart from the faux construct of Dalits and upper caste
                being permanent political foes, Dalit-Muslim unity is
                another imaginary construct. In fact, Dalits have always
                been the first and worst victim of riots and Islamic
                violence across the country. We have recently seen the
                religious persecution of Dalits by Muslims in Kanth,
                repeated rioting against Dalits in West Bengal,
                Trilokpuri in Delhi, religious persecution of Dalits in
                Pakistan and Bangladesh, etc. …It is astonishing to
                note that the same people, who assert day in and day out
                that Dalits are ‘not’ Hindus, immediately dump the
                Dalits in case of Dalit-Muslim clash by dubbing Dalits
                as ‘majoritarian Hindu fascists’ or the ‘foot
                soldiers’.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
-   Reservation boost.
    -   “Reservation, in essence, played the same role of capital
        accumulation for Dalits, which the state power and
        bureaucratic-socialist system played for the forward castes in
        the post-Independent
        India.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
        -   “And since, in a closely linked Indian society the benefits
            of success is not confined to the ‘individual’ alone but has
            spin-offs for the larger family and ‘biraadaari’, the actual
            impact of job reservation has been far wider than what is
            normally acknowledged.” … “The new generation of Dalit
            leadership, which emerged in the 80s, was mainly drawn from
            the class of government employees and officials. In fact,
            the BSP movement in U.P was envisioned and led by the Dalits
            who were beneficiaries of the reservations and were able to
            command real resources, substantial enough to be transformed
            into political
            capital.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
    -   “Moreover, now the next generation of Dalits is increasingly
        diversifying out of government sector and into the private
        sector and
        business.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
-   Independent dalit assertion in politics
    -   Early congress support.
        -   “Congress also acted as guarantor of some modicum of safety
            and protection for Dalits, peppered with welfare policies.
            In fact, the breakdown of the Congress system saw a sharp
            increase in anti-Dalit violence in the
            70s.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
    -   “In short, Dalits are no longer hesitant to collaborate and work
        with other castes for their respective political goals and this
        time it is not the old Congress structure with Dalits as the
        mute, subservient
        partners.”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
    -   Fissures
        -   “political success of Dalit politics also meant that
            fissures began to emerge in the Dalit camp as more and more
            Dalit castes were politicised and empowered. They started
            demanding a share in the power and questioning the dominance
            of the vanguard Dalit castes (usually the more numerous and
            resourceful
            ones).”[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-dalits-are-moving-towards-bjp/).
