My current philosophy of debating

I am always blown away by the number of things I learn from others in
debates and discussions.

A note of warning is in order though.

-   **The right intention: Truth**.
    -   I like to debate to reach an agreement on the essential truth
        being discussed, rather than to nitpick on the unimportant
        peripherals just show my smarts or escape the need to admit
        defeat.
-   **Correctness vs humbleness**: I prefer to be precise and clear in
    debates – something which is occasionally (and wrongly IMO)
    perceived as arrogance. Just as in mathematics, there are no
    foolish, humble or arrogant statements when debating facts and
    processes – only correct and incorrect ones. Similarly, arguments
    are simply sound or unsound, and that is what I usually seek to
    establish. I find it better to call the bluff behind solidly held
    beliefs (in the context of a debate). Quietly accepting the claim
    1+1 = 3 is not a sign of humbleness, and I strongly believe that
    this clarity should extend to socio-political discrouse among
    familiars!
-   **Avoid logical fallacies**.
    ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy))
-   Adapt the **principle of charity**.
    ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity))
    -   Nassim’s summary: “You can attack what a person \*said\* or what
        the person \*meant\*. The former is more sensational. The mark
        of a charlatan (say the journalist Sam Harris) is to defend his
        position or attack a critic by focusing on \*some\* of his/her
        specific statement (“look at what he said”) rather than
        attacking his position (“look at what he means”), the latter of
        which requires a broader knowledge of the proposed idea.”

See something obvious that’s missing here? Please tell me.
