Competition between cults of deities in India vs the Middle East

## 

(This postwas extracted from [this FB
discussion](https://www.facebook.com/koenraad.elst.3/posts/10205504740950737?notif_t=notify_me).)

-   The great sage Charles Darwin proposed the principle of natural
    selection. A generalization of his vision informs this narrative.
-   Every cult (or memeplex) that is more successful (ie fitter) than
    others (or successful at the cost of others) in the ecosystem of
    Indian minds, becameso because of its superior adaptations. This
    spans not only hindu cults, but also buddhist ones – they were all
    in the meme pool competing against each other. You who use the term
    “comparative evolution” should consider these obvious parallels to
    biological evolution.
    -   The govardhana incident is a transparent (and in hindsight
        successful) attempt by the kRShNa cult to supplant the ancient
        vaidika aindra cult. This we also see in the khANDava forest
        conflict, and it is in line with other paurANika cult
        competitions (eps. shiva vs viShNu, as in: narasimha -> sharabha
        -> gaNDaberuNDa chain).
-   Indian deity competitions show various successful adaptations, such
    as:
    -   absorption (eg. Indra is but a small manifestation of kRShNa, is
        less powerful)
    -   establishment of superior power (rAma defeats paraShurAma,
        sharabhahumbles narasimha etc..)
-   Contrast with deity competition in other eco-systems.
    -   One adaptation that was wildly successful in the middle east was
        one of Mosaic exclusivism. It incited violent intolerance
        towards adoration of other deities, and alternative forms of
        adoration.
    -   That probably says something about how the Indian ecosystem was
        different from the middle eastern ecosystem –
        -   there was the hoary vedic lore one could not afford to diss,
        -   the competition happened in the hearts and minds of
            philosophers well established in their homeland, rather than
            a population of common ruffians stressed by an exile to
            Babylon.
-   Now that the Indian ecosystem has beeninvaded bysystems with
    Mosaic exclusivism, how will some successful Indian devacults
    adapt? Which cults will adapt?
    -   One adaptation seems inevitable: Violent intolerance has to be
        met with violent intolerance.
