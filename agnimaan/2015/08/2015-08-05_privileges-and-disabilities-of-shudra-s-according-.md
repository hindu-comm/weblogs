Privileges and Disabilities of shUdra-s according to dharmashAstra-s

#### Privileges of shUdra-s

-   Fewer ritual demands
-   Almost no food or drink restrictions.
-   No gotra/ pravara based marriage restrictions.
-   Pursuit of nearly any occupation (theoretically barring those of
    brAhmaNa and kShatriya).
-   Little or no penance for deviating from the shAstra.

#### Disabilities of shUdra-s

-   Summary by P V kANe:
    [FB15](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153153089917989).
-   Ritual and spiritual restrictions
    -   There were various spiritual restrictions on the shUdra, owing
        to his culturally unrefined state.
        -   ***Attenuation***:
            -   shankarAchArya famously gives the examples of vidura and
                dharmavyAdha and says that the shUdra can attain
                brahmavidyA nevertheless.
    -   Studying the veda was barred. Gautama (an early author) even
        barred them from hearing it.
        -   ***Attenuation***:
            -   devala disagreed.
            -   They were explicitly authorized to repeat various
                popular non-vedic mantra-s and other poetry.
    -   shUdra-s could not consecrate vaidika fires and major
        performvaidika sacrifices.
        -   There are indications within the veda-s themselves that in
            early times, even shUdra-s could perform vaidika sacrifices.
        -   ***Attenuation***:
            -   badarI and the bhAradvAja shrauta sUtra disagreed. But
                they might have referred to an ancient class of
                shUdra-s.
            -   Though they could not do iShTi-s (sacrifices), they
                could do pUrta-dharma (building of wells, temples,
                etc.., distributing food).
            -   They could do the daily 5 mahA-yaJNa-s using a non-vedic
                fire.
    -   A shUdra could hear the smRti-s, itihAsa-s and the purANa-s
        through a brAhmaNa reader. Some dharmashAstra-s (eg.
        shUdrakamalAkara) prohibit from reading it himself.
    -   Permitted saMskAra-s were fewer, and non-vedic.
        -   As a consequence of not studying the veda-s, there were
            shUdra-s acquired only one formal Ashrama – gRhastha. So, no
            upanayana.
        -   No saMskAra-s could be performed with vaidika mantra-s. One
            had to use mantra-s from the purANa-s or tantra-s. This was
            observed in practice (eg. in rites of shivAji’s later
            successors).
    -   A greater period of ritual impurity.
-   Legal disabilities
    -   Higher punishment for certain offences.
        -   Adultry with a dvija woman.
        -   Slander against a dvija.
    -   A shUdra could not be a judge (if he was not a king to be sure).
    -   Lower punishments were prescribed for killing a shUdra.
-   Limitations on social intercourse with dvija-s.
    -   brAhmaNa-s could not accept alms from them or eat their cooked
        food in common circumstances, or even be touched by him.
        -   All this was earlier allowed in some cases, but was later
            barred as kali-varjya.
-   Occupation
    -   He was encouraged to serve a dvija for livelihood; but there was
        always the Apad-dharma loophole (formalized further in later
        dharmashAstra-s) that enabled him to escape this.
    -   Though he could accumulate wealth, the smRti-s dissuaded this,
        on account of pride of wealth and presumed ignorance of the
        class. This was by no means a compulsion.
    -   brAhmaNa and kShatriya occupations were barred to him (though in
        practice, shUdra-s came to found many a dynasty).
