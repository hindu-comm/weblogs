“Borrow but curse” dynamic in schisms



The below isdrawn from a dialogue between two friends about what we can
learn from the failing of the followers of the AgingCamel.

**Borrowings from Hindu traditions**

Zoroastrianism with their angry schism from Vedic civilization, and
their disingenuous “borrow but curse” relationship with Brahminism –
something Islam later did to Zoroastrianism (and Buddhism and Hinduism).
There is no doubt that the Hindus were in no mood to help the Saracens,
especially since they had extended their empire into the Punjab.

During Buddhist times, a lot of positive cross-pollination happened
between Buddhist Indics and Buddhist and Zoroastrian Iranics. But
perhaps that did not do much to humour Hindu Indians. Some speculate
that one reason the Iranics had an affinity for Buddhism was probably
because Gautama Siddhartha himself was from the Shakya clan that
supposedly had Iranic roots – and had Iranic traditions that ran counter
to Vedic strictures, including sibling marriage.

**ZarathruShTran iconoclasm and its consequences**

So far as Alexander’s invasion goes, we don’t have any direct sources
from the Hindu side on their thought process but we can speculate a bit.
Greeks despite being more distant cousins of Hindus than Iranians seem
to have diverged less from Hindus in some key ways in their praxis. The
development of Zoroastrianism involved to some extent what Assmann calls
as “counter religion”, the counter part here involving the deva-s and
their worshipers. Perhaps the Hindus still retained this antagonism from
the old days. It was 150 years before Alexander that Xerxes boasted of
wiping out the last of the deva worshipers in Iran. May be the Hindus
still remembered this?

We know that the post Zoroastrian Persians had a streak of iconoclasm if
the Greek claims of their temple destruction during their invasion of
Greece are to be believed. The Greek view is that their own sacrilege in
Persia under Alexander was a payback. Much later Cicero also provides a
religious motive for the Persian actions in Greece.

Considering all this the Hindus may not have been too eager to help the
Iranians once they threw out the Greeks & unified themselves under the
Mauryas.
