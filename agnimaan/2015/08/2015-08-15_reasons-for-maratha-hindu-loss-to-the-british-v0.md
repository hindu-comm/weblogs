### Reasons

-   British grand strategy and understanding of the enemy was much
    superior to ours.
    -   “The British had been planning on how to colonize India as far
        back as early 1700’s while the Marathas were in their life and
        death struggle with the Mughals.”
    -   “Besides, the British Plan already had the solid backing of a
        very thorough study of India by now and evaluation of its
        people. Consider this: Captain James Tod had already surveyed
        the history and geography of the entire rAjapUta country with
        every single one of its clan – even though they were politically
        still independent – and had already produced in the first two
        decade his celebrated ‘Annals and Antiquities of rAjapUtAnA’,
        not to mention that the European Indology as a discipline was
        already flourishing with its second generation with the likes of
        Colebrooke and Schlegel now in chairs, William Jones dead just a
        couple of years back. In contrast, we seriously doubt if there
        was even one Hindu at the time who properly knew the basic
        history and geography of
        Britain!”\[[BE](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/)\]
    -   Our understanding of the enemy was inferior.
-   Perimeter strategy, fed by sea lanes they dominated.
    -   “The above point leads naturally to the most important issue –
        by controlling the trade routes by sea the English could develop
        a perimeter strategy in which they could hem the Hindus on all
        sides using their control of key coastal centers – Bombay,
        Madras and Calcutta. Thus, the marATha-s came to be naturally
        surrounded by the English, who could indefinitely keep
        themselves supplied by sea, even as they cut off the Hindu
        communication lines inside the country. They completed the
        perimeter strategy by the third Anglo-Maratha war and this more
        or less doomed the first war of independence in
        1857.”[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)
-   Use of reliable Indian merceneries and forces by the British, using
    their colonial money.
    -   “Indeed, a key ability of the English was to purchase loyalties
        for
        money.”[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)
    -   Indians had kept up the ancient Indo Eurpean mercenary
        tradition.
-   Maratha losses andinfighting, contrasted with battle hardened
    British leadership.
    -   Death of experienced Maratha leaders at Panipat
    -   “Such men leading their companies as Maj. General Charles
        Cornwallis, who had resisted George Washington in battles of New
        York, Princeton, Philadelphia and Virginia, before now coming to
        India to redeem his repute; Arthur Wellesley, whose war-resume
        boasted of extremely diverse experience across the continents
        ranging from the Flanders Wars along side the Austrians against
        the French, the naval war against Spanish in Philippines, action
        in Iberian peninsula, and finally the Waterloo campaign that
        ended the career of Napoleon, besides being a superb politician
        – he retired as the PM of UK; Thomas Hislop who had seen action
        on the British side during the American as well as French
        Revolutionary Wars, had commanded naval operations against Dutch
        in West Indies, had successfully led the Siege of Gibraltar
        defeating joint armies of Spaniards and French, now leading
        British action against the maharaTTA-s; General Gerard Lake,
        veteran of American, French and Irish wars; General David
        Ochterlony, an American colonial product born in Boston and
        veteran of a variety of battles in America and Europe before
        arriving in India (famous for his harem in dillI of over a dozen
        women).”
        \[[BE](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/)\]
-   Reliance on treacherous Abrahamist merceneries on our side
    -   Betrayal by European officers hired by Marathas into their army.
        -   “The truth is the Indians were not ethnocentric enough,
            whereas the Europeans were just beginning to evolve a sense
            of white identity.” … “It needs to be emphasized again that
            the Hindu shortfall in this regard was not due to the lack
            of Hindu identity as the leukosphere would like to claim,
            but simply due to the Hindu failure to properly read the
            developing identity of the “other” in their
            payroll.”[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/)
-   There was more incentive for the British limited-term appointed
    leadership to gain glory during their term in office.
    ([FB15](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153175312897989))
    -   Turns out this is an ancient ancient trick. It was observed in
        the first punic war, where the annually appointed Roman consuls
        had great incentive to make bold moves and grab glory before
        their appointment was up. See

### Non reasons

-   Technological differences were not a major factor, neither was
    military technique.
    -   “The technological difference explanation doesn’t wash as far as
        land armies go, in fact I would say the gap is greater today
        than it was back then. Yes navally we were surpassed but on land
        the Marathas could hold their
        own.”[SP_FB](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153070311757989:0)
