Proposed hindu responses to demographic projections



The situation: the rapidly increasing proportion of Abrahamists in India
(and more broadly, worldwide), leading to Hindu composition falling
below the 50% mark at least before 2100 if we fail to respond. How
shouldhindusrespond?

Full credits for the below stunningly clear thoughts on the matter
should go to **Shatruntapa Patel/ @rjrasva**,who laid it out in a
conversation today. I have requested him to kindly dispel the
foolishness of our fellows by publishing articles on the topic in
popular portals. In the meantime, here’s a taste to prep your appetite
(cool headed comments are welcome):

-   **Threats** to India due to demographic changes in the foreseeable
    future.
    -   A second partition involving Assam, Bengal, Kashmir.
        -   Possibly also Telangana and Kerala.These are not too
            precarious, being surrounded by Hindu majority states.
    -   A large scale all-India Islamic rebellion.
        -   Examples from elsewhere:
            -   Dungan Rebellion of China
                \[[WI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_Revolt_(1862%E2%80%9377))\]
            -   Christian rebellion of Japan.
-   **Potential weaknesses in our response**
    -   Racial admixture in our population makes it harder for us to be
        ruthless, since the inimical population and their backers look
        like us.
        -   Motivating studies:
            -   Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental
                simulation of actionsduring observation of outgroups.
                \[[pdf](http://www.researchgate.net/publictopics.PublicPostFileLoader.html?id=512385f4e24a465848000000&key=9fcfd512385f426ae9)\]
        -   Contrast with the homogenous Chinese and Japanese. Their
            homogeneity makes it easy for them to view converts as a
            fifth column of aliens and be ruthless.
    -   Suicidal philosophies “Idiot’s vedanta” causes people to
        mistakenly believe thatit is ok to tolerate Abrahamisms.
    -   Multiple front battle, dealing with: economically powerful
        Islamic states, western christian/ post-christian christian and
        Han imperialist powers.
    -   We are more divided (eg. by jAti-s competing for reservation)
        than they are.
-   Ideas for **strengthening the position of hindus in the India**n
    homeland.
    -   Resettle Hindus from hindu-majority states like Himachal Pradesh
        in precarious states like Kashmir and Assam.
    -   Curb Abrahamist population growth
        -   Stem or reverse the influx of muslim migrants from
            Bangladesh and Burma.
        -   Incentivize low fertility among abrahamists.
    -   Increase Hindu birthrate – through conscience, education and
        incentives.
    -   Maintain Hindu battle readiness and military participation.
        Require military service.
    -   Suppress Abrahamist ideology ruthlessly (I know this is very
        hard).
        -   As a very first step, tackle foreign missionaries and chruch
            funded NGO-s.
        -   Small scale and half hearted “ghar vApasi-s” and polemics
            cannot keep up with Muslim fertility.
        -   Hinduize our critical institutions, especially the military.
-   **Have a plan B if India falls**: How to strategically spread out to
    ensure Hindu survival.
    -   This is not to deny that we should do our best to improve Hindu
        position in India, but it is not a wise survival strategy to
        entirely concentrate there.
    -   **Desiderata** about the “destination”.
        -   The destination must have the economic ability to support
            new arrivals.
        -   It is better if the natives of the“destination” are a
            mixture of races and ethnicities, so that racial hatred and
            ethnic cleansing is much less likely.
        -   It is better if the “destination” has a strong pagan
            undercurrent.
    -   Strategic things Hindus should do **upon arriving at
        the“destination”**.
        -   Don’t just focus on making money, getting civil power and
            winning spelling bees. Do not neglect “military power and
            participation”.
            -   Remember the lessons from Uganda and Fiji.
    -   **Proposed destinations**
        -   South America. (Racial admixture, extant hindu foothold in
            the north, large pagan undercurrent.)
-   **Lessons from other populations**.
    -   Modern Orthodox Jews lead successful professional lives, while
        maintaining an orthodox lifestyle and having large families.
        -   Eg. Robert Aumann the Nobel Laureate economist.
    -   Mormon families are similar large.
        -   Fertility pattern: Summary from
            [MF_E15](http://mormonfertility.blogspot.com/).
            -   Observations
                -   1\. Larger than replacement level numbers of
                    children. (That is to say significantly higher
                    than 2.1 children per woman, on average).
                -   2\. Despite widespread use of contraception. This
                    implies that for Mormons family size is usually
                    chosen deliberately.(By contrast, other religious
                    groups with significantly above-replacement
                    fertility do not allow contraception.)
                -   3\. In a group of people who are more educated than
                    average and economically more successful than
                    average.
                -   4\. Average fertility (numbers of children) tends to
                    be highest among the most educated and wealthiest
                    Mormons.
            -   Explanation: The pattern of Mormon fertility could be
                explained in a general sense as a combination of two
                forces: one tending to increase family size, the other
                tending to limit family size.
                -   1\. On the one hand, Mormonism encourages large
                    families, yet
                -   2\. On the other hand Mormonism encourages what
                    might briefly be described as ‘self-reliance’ – in
                    the sense that the ideal Mormon family unit should
                    be able (as a rule) to support itself without
                    assistance from outside the family.(Indeed, the
                    Mormon family ought to aim to generate a surplus to
                    use on church activities such as buildings and
                    mission work – it should also be noted that
                    virtually no money goes on salaries, since Mormon
                    Priests (all adult men in good standing), Bishops
                    and Stake Presidents, are all unpaid part-timers –
                    hence indeed they usually subsidise these roles from
                    other jobs.)
                -   3\. The combination leads to wealthier Mormon
                    families being the largest, on average, since they
                    can afford to bring up larger numbers of children
                    decently, without using external
                    resources.Presumably poorer Mormons must
                    necessarily limit their family sizes voluntarily by
                    means of contraception.
    -   Ultra Orthodox Jew males simply collect state money, study torah
        and breed – women may work to provide additional support, and
        they are socialized to value the best Torah scholar.
    -   Jews **very deliberately study and strategize** for their
        survival.
        -   Eg. UK-demography
            [study](http://www.jpr.org.uk/publications/tag.demography).
            Considering to the rise of India and China
            [IS](http://isteve.blogspot.ca/2010/07/china-v-india-which-will-be-good-for.html).
        -   Dr. Shalom Wald
            \[[bookz](http://bookzz.org/book/2493368/cfbd55)\], who
            “chose 14 well-known historians, from Thucydides to Gibbon,
            Spangler, Toynbee and Kennedy, and examined their theories
            concerning the circumstances in which civilizations flourish
            or collapse. Then he tried to examine how these theories can
            be applied to the context of the Jewish people.” One major
            recommendation was that Jews do not concentrate entirely in
            Israel – it is not the best survival strategy.
    -   Modern orthodox jews conduct military-style camps which
        militarily prepare youth. This has led to the recent ascent of
        orthodox Jewish officers in the Israeli army.
