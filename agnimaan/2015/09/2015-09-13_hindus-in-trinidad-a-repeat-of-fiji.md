Hindus in Trinidad – a repeat of Fiji?

**Background**

The following is from a conversation among friends.

37.6% are Indian origin in Trinidad.

“According to the 2011 Census, 33.4% of the population was Protestant
(including 12.0% Pentecostal, 5.7% Anglican, 4.1% Seventh-day Adventist,
3.0% Presbyterian or Congregational, 1.2% Baptist, and .1% Methodist),
21.5% was Roman Catholic, 18.1% was Hindu, and 5.0% was Muslim. A small
number of individuals subscribed to traditional Caribbean religions with
African roots, such as the Spiritual Baptists (sometimes called Shouter
Baptists) (5.7%); and the Orisha (0.1%). ”

so just 23% pagan.

This island is so mixed up sometimes its hard to tell what some one
practices  
You would find Muslims who would be by a Christian home for xmas
drinking rum and eating pork

**Indian marginalization and racial tension.**

Indian were marginalized for years since they came here brought by the
British but also by the Descendants of slave like myself ….The change
came with the Independence transition in the 50’s we got our first local
government made up of Africans. Making it hard for them since they could
not speak standard English well….and could not get into the public
sector….But they built their own school with help from the Canadian
churches converting some of course. They excelled ….So while the back
became dependent on the state the Indians became self sufficient .In the
90’s we got our first Hindu Indian PM and every truely open for them
now….They have a heavy presence in the Public sector now. Police Army
etc…..

\*\*\*while the blacks became dependent\*\*\*\*

The only reason racial tension dont really get out of controlled here is
because there is enough wealth to go around compared to other placed
where Indian settled in the Caribbean…Oil and gas put us above average….

My take is the Indian came here already prejudice because of their ideas
of caste etc and the African who having no one else to blame for any
issue when the British left blame the Indians…Both are at fault for the
silliness but in essence came here on the same boat to work and things
could work once their is mutual respect and understanding of our past

**Hindu Army participation**

(Question) So, do hindu Indians form say 30% of the army atleast?the
reason we wonder is because hindus have been stupid enough to neglect
this important role in other lands (eg: fiji), with disastrous
consequences.  
no not really but the discrimination is as blatant as before ….Once a
Minister was fired for highlighting a reporting stating Indians were
marginalize in the Police service … The race card was pulled so to speak
and he was sent home. The PM who sent him home was a Hindu Indian which
I found silly because he was stating facts.  
The only time I have seen many Indian in the Police service within my 3
odd decades on this planet is when We got our first Indian PM  
And my father was a Police officer so I know how those systems operate  
In the report it state a lot of Indian were more than qualified to join
but were put aside for Africans  
In school even as a adult and i think back all my Indian friend
generally their parent were self employed mostly in farming , merchants
that sort of thing and all the Africans had government jobs

It also fed straight into the culture so Indian are now doctors lawyers
accounts engineers multimillion dollar businessmenand the African
despise them because they didn’t take education seriously because they
were in control more a number of years

(Question:) So, the Indians do try (a bit), but are discriminated
against.Indians are making the same mistake they made in Kenya and Fiji
then.

hmmmm interesting

**The rAmacharitamAnasa brAhmaNa mahA sabhA**

(A favorable view from [Hinduism
Today](http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4657).
Comments – The Sat Maharaj he is the head of the sabhaaA very Racist
individual. Umesh now is a belong to another sect )

sometime I think Indians suffer from a identity crisis like blacks  
what’s this crisis like?  
example their is a huge sabha that controls most of the hindu here they
say they alone can be brahmin priest and they are descendants of that
caste in India  
my thing is which bunch of Brahmins would leave India to come here and
cut sugar cane  
that puzzle me  
i see.  
they have last name like maharajmahabhiretc

(Question) so, do other hindu trinidadians resent this?  
yesbecause it excludes a lot of them from being priests and doing
ritual for ppl  
(Question) what fraction are they?(of hindus there)do they still keep
the samskAra-s (like upanayana)? And are they well educated in
sanskrit?  
hahah  
only Brahmin Priest of the line cane do upanayana  
Sanskrit is dead to them  
I have tried my best to get them to learn it  
but I am tried of begging them

i mean is 1 in every 3 hindu trinidadian a member of this sabha?  
oh  
well no but its the biggest hindu sect on the island  
yea in some sense yes

They read mostly the Tulsi das ramchitamanas

local priest tell the myths story and teach them as being literal.I
think its another reason hindus convert

**Role (or rather, the lack) of sanskrit**

(Question) do they tend know a lot of mantra-s (if they’re in the ritual
business, that is)?  
Every thing is generally done by guess in my opinion  
and that observation is based on the little sanskrit i know

(Question) what’s it like in nearby nations like guyana?are race
tensions higher there?  
not really

(Question) also spoken sanskrit movement is active in trinidad?  
only me and hand full of ppl know any sanskrit at all  
how did you come to learn it?  
I want to get a Samskrit bhaarati centre here

(Question) why dont you start one? (I’m serious)  
Me learning sanskrit is more of a far fetched spiritual journey that
would lead to another discourse but i didnt ant to know all the spoken
sanskrit and grammar just want to learn vedic chanting but since I know
how complicated it is I settle for classical sanskrit ……but that what I
am working on now with my teachers and the Bangalore branch  
We trying to establish a centre here for sanskrit studies and Indian
philosophy

(Additional note: They would usually dump Sanskrit for Hindi as singing
songs in that language is more popular than chanting Mantras.)

(Question) vey cool! are you an afro?  
yes

(Question) are there many afro hindus?  
no very few

SS:****most came from UP, hence the popularity of ramcharitmanas which
was/is the popular text. a few came from tamilnadu to trinidad.

In Martinique most Indians came from tamilnadu and other southern
states.

In Suriname, Guyana, and Trinidad from UP area.

Its another reason Sanskrit is not importantthey have no need for it in
the way they practice.Very much like fijians, who barely need it

SS:most samskrita knowledge and practice was lost anyway in the north
under the heavy muslim pressure and destruction of centers of learning,
in part the development of bhakti was a response to these circumstances
where in ramayana was taken to the masses through vernacular awadhi by
tulasidas.

yeah. and many brahmins in that area had taken up agriculture, even army
service. not suprising many of them would have found their way to
trinidad.  
desperate times.

I called the Hinduism here creole hindus.

SS:****i was reading some early indentured accounts, they say the
ramcharitmanas was the only thing that kept them going after the back
breaking labor and being in a strange land (sometimes the brits lied to
the laborers they recruited on where they were going). The early
Brahmins used to make them sing the ramcharitmanas as it was already
known to them so that they wouldn’t forget.

That is very true  
they know the text very well  
it kept them sane



**Mixed race**

(Question) i see that 14% are mixed race – they’re mostly afro+indian
right?  
the mix are mostly indian and african  
we call them douglas  
(Question) And mostly non-hindus, right?  
yea  
I have not a clue why douglas but with the mention of the word we know
it is indian mix with african  
i see.  
most douglas are not hindus  
hindus easily convertits because there is not a solid base of Indian
culture here

**Hindu and pagan afros, and sabhA antipathy**  
(Question) Was
<http://www.chakranews.com/hindu-temple-in-trinidad-vandalized-with-human-waste-and-its-deities-destroyed-again/5040>
big news?  
i see.  
yes that happens at times  
you heard of Jack Warner???  
He is a Fifa offical  
African Hindu  
if he is not a hindu no one does yajnas more than him lol

he was at a temple one time and they almost burnt it down the following
day

(Question) wow! when was this?in that case it was indians doing
itnon-hindu indians?  
I have been met with abuse for learning sanskrit  
no hindu indians

(Question) weird – why would they burn a temple?and why’ve you been met
with abuse for learning sanskrit?  
because a african was inside of it

(Question) wow. how stupid.not knowing friends, not knowing enemies.
sign of a doomed people.

The monopoly of the temples by the hindu sabhaa is a big money making
enterprise  
I was told dont learn sanskrit to do rituals.they oppose knowledge for
hindus

(Question) the temple which was burnt down was not affiliated with the
sabhA?  
yes  
i see.

(Question) i sort of understand why the sabhA people would burn down a
temple they don’t control (destroying competition). But why specially
target a temple patronized by afro-s?  
They dont really like Africans  
I am not allowed to join  
yeah – but it’s not even their temple.  
my upanayana was done in secret

(Question) roughly what fraction of temples are non-sabhA?  
25%or so

(Question) are there other forms of paganism amongst the africans there?
is hinduism the most popular among them?  
we have orisa  
orissa is a west african practice  
we have the baptiste they do hindu ritual at times

they are mostly african that would worship shiva and hanuman mostly

They say shiva is a rasta manlolthey got that heavy influence from
Indian that came here  
but they would not admit it.Africans did not bring ganja here the
indians did

(Question) would you consider them pagan? (ie are they into the “true
religion” vs “false religion” , true god vs false god business?)

They are just a bunch of pot heads looking for something  
lost African trying to look for their ownselves  
I pity them at times

SS: rastas r abrahamic, they worship Haile Selassie I, emperor of
Ethiopia. They have some weird beliefs.  
Orisa is west african, according to that ganga teerath pilgrimage
article goddess Oshun is identified by them with Ganga, both of them
having yellow as their color.  
that is them

**The madrasi-orisa sympathy**  
most Indian i was told came from utterpradesh right  
but there were some came from Tamil nadu  
and Tamil indians are called madras  
dont know whybut other hindu sect dont like to associate with them  
but the mix well with the africans  
they also mix with with the orissa

(Question) why don’t they like the madrasis?  
because both still do animal sacrifice  
So kali and shiva is respected amounfg the baptiste and orissa.

(Additional note:The Kali bhaktas here who do Sacrifice now somewhat do
it in hiding because of the scorn shame disgust they are met with by the
so called Ahimsa conventional Hindus. Now some temples have converted to
do no sacrifice because of this.In the Temples that still do it Goats
chickens and for a special type of ritual Pigs/hogs are sacrificed. I
personally don’t have anything against Animal sacrifice because the
practice is old ancient and pervaded all major cultural groups on the
planet and its where Hinduism originated from. Some Hindus don’t really
know what the coconut represents or what it replaced and I often have to
tell people Shiva’s Trident is not a Agricultural tool for farming.)

(Question) so madrasis mix well with orisa  
yea;Is like same force different form

(Question) good. they’re not in the sabhA i suppose.  
no they keep to themselves  
the sabhaa hate them  
due to the animal slaughter  
SS: does trinidad have any taino native people?  
they were two sect arawaks and caribs  
the first were the peaceful type and they died off the their still are
caribs arounds  
SS:i see thx
