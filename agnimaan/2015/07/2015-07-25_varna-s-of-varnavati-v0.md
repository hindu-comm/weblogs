varNa-s of varNavatI – v0

## What is this about?

What might an updated hindu varNa-system look like? How would it compare
to other social systems? This we address in the fantasy state of
varNavatI. It is concievable that some state might choose to adapt this
system or a variant thereof – and thrive as a result.

## The varNa-s of varNavatI

The varNa-s of varNamatI are four in number.

-   The brAhmaNa-s.
    -   Distinctive social functions
        -   Offer spiritual and dhArmika guidance and services to the
            other varNa-s.
        -   Update the dharmashAstra-s to suit newer circumstances,
            without abandoning:
            -   the ancient spirit of bringing harmony out of social
                chaos,
            -   the urge to protect the fitness of the society
            -   the feeling of belonging in a universal web that extends
                far beyond just humanity.
        -   Officers in the Administrative service.
    -   Importance of these functions
        -   They help the smooth continuance of the divine universal
            order (RtA), as it applies to the society of varNavatI.
        -   Thus, they uniting all sections of the society to function
            together in great harmony.
        -   Needless to say, the society as a result is fitter (in its
            ability to improve social happiness and resistance to
            external threats).
    -   Eligibility
        -   Knowledge of relevant sacred lore (rooted in the Hindu
            past), of alternate social systems (especially those of
            their competitors), of novel findings that affect their
            understanding of the dharma.
            -   Essential core: History of Dharmashastra by PV Kane. The
                entirety of mahAbhArata.
        -   Knowledge of some spiritual lore.
        -   Needless to say: Knowledge of sanskrit.
        -   AchAra/ personal standards of behavior.
            -   A certain standard of behavior is expected of
                brAhmaNa-s, major deviation from which should
                automatically result in prAyashcitta (expiation) –
                preferably self-induced.
        -   Avoidance of conflicts of interest
            -   No major stakes in businesses – beyond what is required
                for sustenance of oneself and one’s dependents.
-   The kShatriya-s
    -   Distinctive social functions
        -   Leadership in protecting the country
        -   Governance and administrative service
    -   Importance of these functions
        -   If fantastic varNavatI were invaded or subverted, it will
            soon join ancient Greece and Rome in the museums of their
            conquerors :-)
        -   The dharmashAstra requires some small portion of enforcement
            (daNDa) and protection. (The notion of dharma, if well
            ingrained in the society, should be mostly self enforced.)
    -   Eligibility
        -   Military service (as an officer) in early youth. A few
            continue this duty for a lifetime.
        -   Governance and administrative service after the prime of
            youth has passed. In particular this includesleadership in
            internal security services.
        -   Excellent knowledge of military tactics, history, foreign
            relations and statecraft.
            -   Essential core: nItishAstra-s.
        -   Intermediate knowledge of one current, major dharmashAstra;
            general knowledge of economics, science, society etc.. (as
            in the IAS exam).
        -   AchAra/ personal standards of behavior.
            -   Avoidance of conflicts of interest
                -   Major stakes in businesses – beyond what is required
                    for sustenance of oneself and one’s dependents.
        -   Knowledge of sanskrit.
-   The vaishya-s
    -   Distinctive social functions
        -   Business (without foresaking the dharma towards other
            sections of the society)
        -   Leadership in charity
        -   Financial administrative service to the state – at this
            stage, they should have minimal conflicts of interests,
            having given up all their property.
    -   Importance of these functions
        -   Material prosperity is important for state security and
            gross happiness.
    -   Eligibility
        -   Experience with leadership and management of businesses or
            charities.
-   The shUdra-s – or the rest of the society
    -   Distinctive social functions: none. They are generalists, with
        maximum freedom. Rise to leadership automatically would transfer
        them to one of the other varNa-s.
    -   Importance of these functions
        -   They provide the bulk of the manpower of varNavatI.
    -   Eligibility
        -   Open to all. Everyone is born a shUdra by default, unless
            other qualifications are earned and proven.

## Functioning of the varNa-s

-   The varNa-s are not mutually antagonistic – fighting each other for
    power and reservations. Rather, they are harmonious and
    complementary. The emphasis is on duties and roles, rather than
    rights.
-   Picking a varNa
    -   varNa-s are not determined solely by birth.
    -   Educational opportunities are equally available – prior to
        specialization (which happens by choice and by testing).
        -   There is some affirmative action to provide special
            incentives to families who are traditionally of lower social
            standing. The framing of this is critical: It is \*never\*
            framed as “equal rights” or “social justice”. Rather, it is
            framed as an attempt by the state to develop its human
            resources to the maximum possible extant.
        -   Despite the above, the standards of admission into the
            higher varNa-s is NEVER lowered.
    -   Within a lifetime, they are somewhat fluid – lower varNa to
        higher varNa transitions are possible and reversible, but a fall
        from a higher varNa (requiring higher standards of AchAra) to a
        lower varNa tends to be permanent.
-   Most social functions are open to all, irrespective of current
    varNa. For example:
    -   Salaried/ daily wage employees.
    -   Common soldiers.
    -   Scientists and engineers.
    -   Poets, journalists, lawyers etc..

## System of government

-   varNavatI is NOT a dumbocracy (=democracy). It is either an
    oligarchy or a monarchy.
-   Leadership positions in governing provinces and the state
    -   Selection:
        -   The head of each province (and perhaps the entire state) is
            necessarily a fine kShatriya, past the prime of his youth,
            who has served with distinction both in the military and in
            internal administration. He should have no conflicts of
            interest, as described earlier.
        -   Since the primary function of a ruler is uphold the dharma
            and the state security, he is elected by an electoral
            college consisting of brAhmaNa-s and kShatriya-s.
    -   Limits on the powers of the plutocrats/ monarch:
        -   The electoral college may be mobilized to dismiss a ruler.
            This can happen only once in 10 years.
        -   In matters of internal administration, the body of
            brAhmaNa-s have the power of veto. This can happen as
            frequently as necessary (in case a bad choice was made).
-   Financial leadership.
    -   Selection:
        -   This necessarily has to be an eligible vaiShya – one who has
            shown his or her prowess in both business and charity.
        -   The leadership is elected by a college of vaiShya-s (whose
            enterprise is affected by his decisions) and brAhmaNa-s
            (because the dharma should not take a back seat with regards
            to artha).
