Hindu influence on the Heraka Zeme of Nagaland

Agroup of nAga-s inspired, by rAni Gaidinliu, hasremained heathen, and
has successfully resisted Christianization in Nagaland. Their links with
Hindus areamong the topics explored inLongkumer’s thesis ([pdf
link](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2669/Longkumer%20A%20thesis%2008%20small.pdf?sequence=2)).
Excerpts are below:

===

**Syncretism with Hinduism**

> The ideology of the RSS and VHP has already seeped into Heraka
> rhetoric and their talk is often peppered with these nation-building
> bumper stickers. Phrases such as ‘all religions have truth,
> compassion, and love and are like streams that go into the one ocean’
> or ‘invasion of foreign religion and foreign culture will bring total
> destruction of Naga society. Beware of this danger’—are all too
> common. These phrases reflect neoHindu projection of self and
> tradition and constitute part of the mass programme of such unifying
> Hindu solidarity. Further, powerful symbols such as om and the
> svastika are commonly found in Heraka homes; images of Ram and Sita,
> distributed by VHP activists, find their way into these homes as well
> (see photographs 23 & 24). 185

**Hindu support**

> Janjati Vikas Samiti (as registered in Nagaland) or Vanvasi Kalyan
> Ashram188 , under the umbrella of Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Kalyan
> Ashram (ABVKA) 189 , are active with the Heraka in developmental
> projects, education and also in providing organisational support.
> Integration with ‘Bharat mata’ (mother land)190 is a huge financial
> and cultural investment, pursued by the Kalyan Ashram. For example,
> Kalyan Ashram has recognised Rani Gaidinliu and Haipou Jadonang as
> freedom fighters and have included these and other vanvasi leaders
> around India in a promotional poster that is pasted on almost all
> Heraka and Kalyan Ashram offices (see photograph 25).

> In Saraswati Vidya Mandir, their morning pledge is: Bharat \[India\]
> is my motherland. All Bharatiyas are my brothers and sisters. I love
> my country. I am proud of her rich and varied heritage. I shall always
> strive to be worthy of it. I shall give respect to my parents,
> Acharyas \[teachers\], Classmates and all elders and treat everyone
> with courtesy. To my country and my People, I pledge my devotion. In
> their well being and prosperities alone lies my happiness. BHARAT MATA
> KI JOY. 210

> From the mysterious Nangalôg, a fabled past has been created that
> links the ‘Nagas’ to the rest of India. This tenuous link is
> strengthened by the position of ‘Hindu’ organisations whose aim is to
> embellish and preserve such links. They are thus able to tie the
> notion of vanvasi into the larger notion of a ‘Hindu’ identity,
> espoused by stalwarts of the RSS and VHP, and viewed as encompassing
> the land of the ‘Hindus’. Therefore, the Heraka are seen as preserving
> the sanatan dharma (eternal faith and culture), which is treated
> synonymously with traditional Hinduism.

Significant part of an otherwise patronizing quote from a VHP worker:

> “As a teacher I want to help the Heraka preserve their culture. Heraka
> is related to Hindu: if I believe in a tree, I worship, same with the
> Heraka. Purnima (full moon day) is also similar; they, like us, also
> worship the sun. Heraka are called parampara 194 before becoming
> Heraka. Heraka is an early form of parampara \[sic\] 195 . The Hindus
> have no problem with accepting the Heraka in its fold, as it is also
> Hindu (religion of the soil). 1”
>
> These patronising views are perhaps not uncommon among ‘Hindu’ groups,
> who often view the Heraka as helpless, and needing guidance. But the
> overall view is largely centred on the notion that the vanvasi
> population in general needs support to ‘progress’.
>
> …
>
> The ‘Hindu’ organisations say that they are unwilling to associate
> themselves with the rhetoric of ‘enlightenment’, ‘civilising’, and
> ‘saving’, which they consider a part of Christian mission ideology.
> However, they also often project this view unwittingly.

**Conflict with Christianity**

> The Heraka and Paupaise on the other hand see the use of zao as an
> important part of their tradition and the Heraka have gone to the
> extent of justifying its use by using the popular slogan ‘loss of
> culture is loss of identity’. Most Heraka will state that slogan in a
> drunken stupor. When I first went to the Heraka village, I was given a
> cup of zao at five in the morning at one of the homes I was visiting.
> This first drink was surrounded by apprehension; the first suspicion
> about any outsider is that they are missionaries. By accepting the cup
> of zao, I was no longer a Christian missionary or a Baptist in their
> minds. 1
>
> …That is to say, becoming Christian immediately brings improvement
> ‘not just in self-esteem but in health, education, and the prospect of
> social and economic advancement’ (Brown 2002: 7) which the former
> (Heraka) did not. There is therefore intense competition between the
> Heraka and Christian to have control over these ‘resources’ (schools
> being the prime example), which is further intensified with
> evangelisation on the part of the Christian church to convert the
> Heraka; while the Heraka work hard to maintain the status quo.
>
> …While these developmental trends continue with the aid of ‘Hindu’
> organisations, there is clear opposition by the Christian majority who
> attempt to thwart their plans. In Hsongle, where the Christians form
> the majority in the village council, they have been able to influence
> the council vote against the running of a Heraka school because it is
> partnered with the VHP.

> … He told me that this ‘convert’ and his family had been disowned by
> his Heraka family and had been thrown out of his house and had nowhere
> to go. …I was witnessing a difficult displacement, not a massive
> mobilisation of population from one place to another, but of one
> family, clutching on to their possessions of cooking utensils,
> clothes, furniture and animals, and photos of Rani Gaidinliu in frames
> and tiny lockets around the neck of the mother and daughter. I could
> not help but wonder if they would dispense with those images?
>
> …Moreover, he openly remarked that for him becoming Christian meant
> getting further education. He said he wanted to study theology. His
> intention, as many people told me (Heraka and Christian) was to
> develop his interest in politics and that, as he said, ‘becoming a
> Baptist would profit me, as Nagaland and most of the Nagas are Baptist
> and also the Baptists are the ones spear heading the movement for a
> Naga solution’. For Heseu, becoming Baptist speaks to his notion of a
> pan-Naga identity rooted in a particular understanding of
> Christianity.

**Paupaise view**

> The Paupaise, the ancestral way of life, often do not understand why
> the Heraka and Christian quibble; in Paupaise eyes, they are the same
> (as in foreign), in that Christianity is started by Jesus Christ and
> Heraka by Ranima.
>
> “I heard from others that Heraka is still practising Zeme song and
> dance. But the practice of song, dance, and wearing of ornaments alone
> is not complete Zemese and not complete Zeme. To be a complete Zeme
> and Zemese \[Zeme practice\], they should follow the rituals as we are
> doing, because they are original, from our ancestors. So Heraka are
> half-Zeme. What they are practising is empty (perua)’.”
>
> …The Heraka would respond by saying, ‘the Paupaise generation is the
> kemeume generation (prophecy generation) and it is over. Now is the
> generation of the Heraka, as every people has generations that they
> live under according to the situation and context. 2

**Subversion by Christian memes**

> …As much as they are comfortable with their position, they also
> realise that being seen as Hindu is a difficult road to tread. For
> example, students that attend ‘Hindu’ institutions reflect on the
> exercise of worshipping ‘Hindu’ gods with a little apprehension. 212 A
> former Heraka pupil told me, “for example, we have two aarti (prayers)
> in the evening: we pray to 2 to 3 gods: Lakshmi (wealth), Saraswati
> (knowledge), Ram/Sita (for us tribals, they are like our ancestors).
> Before we go to bed, we have two prayers: the first one is a mantra
> and we pray to Ishvaar (Bhagwan) to give us rest, then the Heraka have
> a prayer song, Ndibantu Dinkuinin. We don’t pray to the statues, or
> idols, but we pray to our unseen God, Tingwang.”
>
> For the Christian and also to some extent the Heraka, monotheism
> implies a form of worship, which is anti-Hindu. God is in the sky,
> limitless, and accessible wherever one is. No earthly images, as with
> the ‘Hindus’, can portray such a powerful being. It is difficult to
> say if the Heraka are anti-Hindu here or just trying to beat the
> Baptist Christians at their own game.
>
> …Indeed, the cosmology was reconstituted, with the abolition of
> various gods, reduction  
> in sacrifices, and the establishment of a monotheistic god. This
> enabled the Heraka to  
> change in a way that was demonstratively beneficial, aiding adaptation
> to a changing  
> 241  
> world that the existing ancestral religion, Paupaise, could not.

**Some harmless borrowing from Christianity:**

![](https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/ZgMByc0.png)

===

**Current situation**

> Now some estimates say that 90% of the Nagas are Christians. 208 The
> importance of Christianity has become imbedded in Naga identity not
> only as a religious tradition but as an act of cultural resistance to
> the largely ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’ population of mainstream India
> (Baruah 2003: 329).
>
> …English became attractive for upward mobility and government jobs;
> Nagas never really adopted Hindi as it was seen as the language of the
> ‘Indian rulers’. In fact, the official language of Nagaland is now
> English.
>
> …Traditional clothes, necklaces, beads, wood carvings and so on were
> burnt publicly as a sign of shedding of ‘old clothes’ and taking on
> ‘the new body of Christ’. This symbolic Christian imagery not only
> affirmed the religious solidarity of the Nagas but it also led to the
> overhauling and indeed the loss of traditional culture overnight.
> Their aim was to create a gulf, to sever the ties between their ‘past’
> lives and the present and future promise

===

**Are the Heraka with Hindus and India?**

> It must be mentioned that the position of the Heraka is amorphous at
> best. They want to be part of the ‘Naga fold’ and have publicly stated
> so, but historically the Heraka have had a tense relationship with the
> Naga Christians over proselytising. Secondly, although the Heraka
> receive considerable support from ‘Hindu organisations’, they are wary
> to be seen as too close to them because then the Naga Christians will
> label them as ‘Hindu’ therefore jeopardising their relationship with
> the larger Naga population.
>
> …Their numbers are largely  
> concentrated around North Cachar Hills, and Heraka is practised mainly
> among the  
> Zeme. Yet the majority of the Nagas are Christians. The Heraka are
> largely antiChristian  
> in their rhetoric because of conversion tactics employed by Christians
> in the  
> past. Therefore, they try to distance themselves from Christian
> schools (in some cases)  
> and instead rely on Government schools or schools started by the VHP
> like Saraswati  
> Vidya Mandir, Vivekananda Vidyalaya and Kendriya Vidyalaya
>
> …Although the ZemeHeraka have endorsed their support for a ‘Naga
> solution’, they are in a difficult position,especially with relation
> to the Indian state (with the support of the RSS and VHP) on  
> the one hand, and the relation with the majority Christian Nagas on
> the other.
>
> …The Heraka say that the Naga claim for independence should be based
> solely on the common ethnic links and not on religious affiliations.
>
> …And, where better for  
> such Christians to target their propaganda but against Rani Gaidinliu,
> by questioning her  
> loyalty to the ‘Nagas’ and by making her an agent of ‘Hindu’ India?
> Rani Gaidinliu saw  
> the Naga Christian vision of either/or as limiting and countered such
> accusations by  
> stating her position that she was both Naga and Indian.
>
> … In fact, the position of Rani Gaidinliu and the expression of her
> ‘Indianness’ as well as her ‘Naganess’ is something the Heraka does
> not want to draw attention to, due to the present political
> sensitivities.Naturally, the Heraka do not wish to commit to any
> single group or ideology in this system. Due to their ambiguous
> position, one gets the impression that the Heraka have to oscillate
> between these two powerful groups they have to confront and live with
> everyday.
