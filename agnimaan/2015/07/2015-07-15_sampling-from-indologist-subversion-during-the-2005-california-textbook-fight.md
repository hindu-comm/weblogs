Emne: Next step: California Comm. vote on Hindutva changes

Dear friends,

success! It seems that we were successful; more details will follow as
soon they become available. Here the initial, partial report from people
present at the meeting of the California State Board of Education:

This afternoon the California Board of Education voted to approve the
school books for adoption in California schools;  
seven of eight publishers’ programs were approved (Including the
initially rejected Oxford U.P. one, it seems without adding in any of
the Hindutva material).

Below, I attach our joint letter for your reference. We had planned to
send it to you earlier, but all the back and forth yesterday in
preparing for today’s (Wednesday’s) meeting prevented me.

Luckily, we had a California historian of india, Prof. J. Heitzman (UC
Davis), present at the meeting who also used a letter written by Prof.
Wolpert.

Hence, some more detailed news about the meeting of the California State
Board of Education:

The meeting was to decide whether to adopt the changes that have already
been suggested, collected in a book containing the massive number of
changes.

Comments from the audience: each one to speak for TWO MINUTES each.

The first cohort of speakers included representatives of the Vedic
Foundation, who all urged adoption of the changes.

The next major group consisted of a number of Sikh speakers who urged
non-adoption of the changes until after the insertion of additional
material on Sikhism.

Prof. Heitzman, speaking for us all, then alluded to the “Standards for
Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content,” section:”
Religion; Indoctrination”, urging the Board not to “encourage or
discourage belief or indoctrinate the student in any particular
religious belief.”

Pointing out that we represent thousands of high-level scholars from all
religious backgrounds dedicated to the academic study of South Asian
history and culture, he stated that we have two main objections to the
current draft that cause us to oppose its adoption:

\(1\) the consulting base, i.e. Dr. Bajpai, is too narrow for a problem
of this complexity; and (2) we “impugn the credentials” of the Vedic
Foundation and other Hindu groups to speak competently on issues of
South Asian history and religion.

These groups project, either overtly or subconsciously, policies known
as Hindutva or “Hinduness” that portray South Asian and specifically
Indian identity as Hindu. Their program has ravaged the social studies
textbooks of India for the last ten years.

He urged the Board not to allow a religious chauvinism of India to
become the policy of the State of California, which would provoke an
academic and international uproar. He volunteered the services of the
university community specializing in the analysis of South Asia for
evaluating the edits and additions proposed for the California
textbooks: “We are ready to earn our pay; let us help you.”

Sincere thanks to Prof. Heitzman and to all of you ! This shows how
concerted action, even if it comes as late as ours, can be successful.

Incidentally, the next thing to tackle is the BBC website. Let us
discuss how to go about it. Please see this:
