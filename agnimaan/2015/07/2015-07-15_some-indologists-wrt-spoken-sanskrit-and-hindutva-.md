A foreword witha 2013 note by Manas:  
=============

Apparently according to Dr. Stella Sandahl, Samskrita revivalists are
interested in “cutting throats”, “raping nuns”, “destroying mosques”,
etc. This preposterous and extremely offensive allegation was made in an
academic e-list no less, eliciting a couple of muted protests. Dr.
Sandahl also makes the equally outrageous allegation that Samskrita
revivalists are all proponents of the Hindutva political movement.  
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0808&L=INDOLOGY&O=D&F=PPPPP&I=-3&P=6368>

Here we find one Dr. Maheswaran Nair positing that Samskrita speakers
are wannabe mass-murderers.  
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0808&L=INDOLOGY&O=D&F=PPPPP&I=-3&P=6266>

Prof. Sheldon Pollock in an interview (available on youtube) also made
some comments against the spoken Samskrita movement, though he was
relatively subdued. His thesis being what I indicated earlier – spoken
Samskrita doesn’t do justice to a language of high intellectual output.

I read those papers you have linked. I must give credit to Dr. Hastings
for presenting a picture that is relatively objective notwithstanding
what I see as his apparent predilections and amusing over-analysis of a
book of simple sentences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the current debate about "spoken Sanskrit" I believe we are  
    talking about two different things. It is one thing when for example  
    a Bengali pandit speaks to Telugu pandit in Sanskrit in order to  
    debate finer points in a text, or a philosophical issue, a literary  
    allusion and so forth. Sanskrit is then their common language, a  
    language of learning, of elegance and wit. And this is quite wonderful.

    It is an entirely different matter to try to revive and 'modernize'  
    Sanskrit. Lying on a table in our university library I found a  
    typical example of the latter. There were new-fangled "Sanskrit"  
    words for money order, check-out counter, bus station, bank draft -  
    as if one finds these things in classical Sanskrit texts! These  
    manuals are quite ridiculous: I found a sentence like ahaM  
    sevaphalAni khAdAmi which was supposed to mean 'I eat apples'. First,  
    as far as I know there were no apples in classical India (weren't  
    they brought in by Babur?), second the word seva is obviously modeled  
    on Hindi seb 'apple' from the Persian sib with the same meaning. This  
    is exactly in line with the examples given by Professor Nair: "adya  
    kati iddali bhakshitam?" "adya chayam piitam kim?", equally  
    ridiculous.  My niece in Delhi once asked to help her with her  
    Sanskrit homework. She had to translate the sentence "Kings live in  
    palaces" into Sanskrit. The word given by the teacher for palace was  
    'mahala' !!!  I tried to convince the little girl that there was no  
    such word in Sanskrit. In vain. The girl said :"teacher says it is  
    mahala", and that was what it had to be.

    It is very sad to se how the ignorant Hindutva forces demean and make  
    the wonderful classical language into something trivial and  
    ridiculous. How do we stop them?
    How can we rescue Sanskrit from these vandals? I doubt that the  
    sevaphalAni-eating student in his mahala can read and understand even  
    one line by Kalidasa or Bana or Jayadeva.
    But he can cut the throat of those who cannot speak his so called  
    Sanskrit. When he is not busy demolishing mosques and raping nuns.

    Dear Prof. Sandahl,

    I think that we should be careful not to be discriminatory against those who
    use Sanskrit in a creative, modernist fashion. The use of Sanskrit as a
    spoken language, whether as standard Sanskrit or as a vulgarized idiom, is
    not per se a political statement and it does not per se reveal a tendency to
    approve of or even to commit political violence. In spite of everything that
    Sanskrit may symbolize, it remains a language that serves the purpose of
    expressing thoughts. And the freedom of thought includes, of course, the
    freedom to choose one's language.

    With best regards,

    Philipp Maas

    Dear Profs. Hart, Nair, and Sandahl, and colleagues,

    With all due respect, I find it hard to accept that the construction  
    of neologisms like 'seva-phala', 'iDDali' or even misuses like  
    'mahAla' are in any way indicative of 'ignorant Hindutva forces'. It  
    is not at all uncommon  to see vernacular words or forms used within  
    medieval Sanskrit manuscripts, and particularly when the concept does  
    not occur in classical Sanskrit. Certain MSS of zivadAsa's or  
    jambhaladatta's vetAla-paJcaviMzati, for example, appear to be  
    replete with north Indian vernacular 'loan-words' and shoddy, Hindi-  
    or Marathi-based grammatical forms. This is  just the tip of the  
    iceberg. Moreover, contemporary spoken Sanskrit is quite obviously  
    and self-consciously a simplification of classical Sanskrit, and this  
    has been done in order for the language to be more accessible and  
    appealing to young, twenty-first century students, who WOULD like to  
    express their thoughts about riding the bus, eating apples, using  
    computers, and other modern-day activities. It's actually quite a fun  
    thing to do.

    One must, it is true, engage in this linguistic practice knowing full  
    well that what one is speaking is a hybridized and simplified form of  
    the classical parole, and this I think is where some of the Hindu  
    nationalist ideological projects are indeed harmful, as Prof. Nair  
    points out, in representing spoken Sanskrit to the Indian public as  
    being both authentic and Hindu. What's most disturbing to me about  
    the Hindu spoken Sanskrit movement is not how the language is  
    treated, but how many textbooks attempt to naturalize (and  
    nationalize) upper-caste, puritanical Hindu practices through  
    language teaching.

    On the other hand, may I respectfully suggest that the idea that the  
    ancientness of Sanskrit somehow debilitates this language from  
    accepting neologisms, or makes it useless for expressing modern  
    ideas, itself might be construed as an act of intellectual violence  
    on par with 'cutting throats', 'demolishing mosques', or 'raping  
    nuns'? Clearly, as scholars of classical Sanskrit, we have an  
    obligation to continue to teach students how to read and understand  
    kAlidAsa, bANa, or perhaps even the magisterial ZrIharSa--but can  
    this teaching not occur side-by-side with an acceptance of a  
    consciously different register of the Sanskrit language, albeit  
    contrived and manufactured, for contemporary, everyday usage? Perhaps  
    the latter might serve as a kind of gateway for the former?

    with best regards,

    Sorry for so many posts, but I think this may be useful to someone.

    Years ago, when I was reading from Ramanuja's Sribhasya, I noticed  
    that his usages often mirror the Sanskrit that is still spoken by the  
    pandits in Chennai.  For example, the word "samiiciina" for "fine,"  
    "good," "excellent" is used by that writer.  On the other hand,  
    Sankara's Sanskrit does not seem to be connected with the Sanskrit I  
    heard in Chennai -- its style and word usage is quite different.  This  
    suggests that there is a continuous tradition of spoken Sanskrit that  
    developed in Tamil Nadu 1000 years ago and still continues today.  The  
    Sanskrit used in Kerala was probably rather different (something also  
    suggested by my very superficial acquaintance with the Manipravala  
    works of 4 or 500 years ago).  Certainly, in many parts of India and  
    Nepal, Sanskrit has been used as a spoken language for a long time.   
    It would seem that each area has developed its own style and word  
    usage.  As we know, the pandits of one area often look down at the  
    Sanskrit (esp. pronunciation) of pandits from other areas.

    There is a wonderful sloka that can be used when teaching beginning  
    Sanskrit -- but I have forgotten the details of the story that goes  
    along with it.  Perhaps someone can recall it.  Someone, wanting to  
    show off to Kalidasa how much Sanskrit he knew, said, "bhojanam dehi  
    raajendra ghrtasuupasamanvitam."  Kalidasa is supposed to have replied  
    "maahiSam ca zaraccandracandrikaadhavalam dadhi."  Of course, the  
    first utterance is ungainly and awkward, while the second flows like  
    moonlight.  The dhvani, according to my pandit, is that Kalidasa is  
    implying that the would-be Sanskrit speaker is stupid and slow, as  
    buffalo yogurt is supposed to dull the mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The thread on spoken Sanskrit has been very interesting, and some  
    points strike me as quite a propos. First, I don't see any problems  
    with neologisms. Even if we ignore the sometimes controversial  
    examples of supposed Dravidian borrowing in early Vedic and the much  
    less controversial ones in later Vedic and post-Vedic (such as  
    niira-), or the late borrowings from North Indian languages in late  
    Sanskrit texts, there is evidence for borrowing at many other stages,  
    and in many different spheres (consider e.g. (tri-)koNa, horaa and  
    the like, from Greek). Moreover, if Sanskrit is to be used in a  
    modern context, not only to discuss fine points of philosophy or  
    grammar, it has to be modernized to make it possible to talk about  
    trains, apples, and the like (and hybrids like relayaana strike me as  
    much more felicitous than words such as agniratha(...)yaana). There  
    is a problem, however, as far as the lexicon goes, namely the whole- 
    scale importation of Sanskrit-derived Hindi, Marathi, etc. words into  
    Sanskrit, with their modern meanings, rather than the use of  
    established Sanskrit words (consider the use of aarambha instead of  
    utsava in the Hindi-speaking area). While Sanskrit needs to be  
    modernized, it does not need to be intellectualized, thank you; it  
    always has been perfectly capable to deal with intellectual issues.

    Second, I agree that the kind of spoken Sanskrit that is being  
    propagated by Hindutva organizations is grammatically, lexically, and  
    intellectually without merit, not far removed from a pidgin form of  
    the language. The fact that it does not provide a useful entry to the  
    full form of the language, as found in the philosophical, religious,  
    and literary tradition of India (not to speak of the vast range of  
    technical literature), supports the view that the motivation for this  
    enterprise is not to connect modern Indians with their traditions but  
    to give Hindus (or better: Hindutvavaadins) a false, manufactured  
    sense of identity. (I should add that the founders of this movement,  
    such as Krishna Shastri, had a much fuller grasp of the language and  
    spoke it very well.)

    Best wishes,

    Hans

    Of course, the spoken Sanskrit courses which serve as introduction to the 
    great language and which are mainly aimed to disprove the critics that 
    Sanskrit was not and is never a spoken language should lead the learners to 
    study the vast corpus of classical texts.
    But, the 'agenda' of the so called Hindutvavadi is not to 'demolish mosques 
    or to rape nuns'. With all their obvious mistakes in some of their views 
    they can not be outrightly condemned and they never resort to such demeaning 
    acts.
    It is so strange that even after such horrific and barbaric terrorist acts 
    being perpetrated in Kashmir still the Hindutvavadi is condemned for those 
    crimes ('demolishing mosques or raping nuns') with which he has been proved 
    subsequently to be not at all associated. !!

    I concur with Professor Hart.  I was at Kanchipuram about ten days ago to attend a sadas (214 particpants from allover South India, mostly from the Tamil country and none from Kerala) of the RV reciters.  The sadas lasted three days, the samhita recitation on the first day, the krama the second day and the gana the third day.  Part of the aim was for the professional vaidikans to raise questions regarding the minutiae of recitation: the questions would be handed overto an MC-like figure who would put it to the sadas and he would invite a known specialist to come forth an answer.  The discussion was all but in Sanskrit with Tamil funcioning to provide a rough syntax.  A Brahmanical coine.

    Licked by the Mother Tongue: Imagining Everyday Sanskrit at Home and in 
    the World
    by Adi Hastings

    Abstract:
    This paper examines the ways in which Sanskrit revivalists in contemporary 
    India imagine social contexts for the production and reproduction of 
    Sanskrit speech. In contrast to the received view of Sanskrit as being a 
    ritual language par excellence, opposed at every step to the domestic 
    sphere and everyday life, Sanskrit revivalists treat Sanskrit as a “mother 
    tongue,” figuring the home as the primary site for the creation of an 
    “everyday Sanskrit” world and the mother as the primary agent of this 
    process of Sanskritizing the domestic sphere. “Domesticating Sanskrit,” 
    the process of bringing the elevated ritual language down into everyday 
    life, at the very same time “Sanskritizes the domestic,” that is, ritually 
    transforms or elevates the home into a “Sanskrit home.” Moving outward 
    from the Sanskritized domestic sphere, activists also imagine other 
    contexts in which one could use Sanskrit, which nonetheless conforms to a 
    notion of a Sanskrit interiority or domesticity.

    Dear colleagues,
    H. H. Hock studied spoken Sanskrit in the 1980s in U.P., in Lucknow  
    and Varanasi, if I remember right. See his article  “Spoken Sanskrit  
    in Uttar Pradesh — a sociolinguistic profile”, Journal of  
    Orientology. Lokaprajñā vol. 2. Prof. N. S. Rāmānuja Tātācārya  
    Felicitation Volume. Puri 1988, 1–24. There has been a small  
    percentage of people giving Sanskrit as their language in every  
    census, but often it seems to be "father tongue" rather than "mother  
    tongue".
    Regards,

    dear friends,
    welcome to such new studies.
    but is is difficult for a naiyayika to imagine ritual transformation of
    household in the context of modern sanskrit revivalism. Since I know
    personally many sanskrit families here, it is nothing but some kind of
    national revivalism.
    thanks

    I myself once encountered someone from Karnataka who lived in the  
    village where "Sanskrit" is spoken.  It was a dumbed-down language not  
    much resembling (in my opinion) the eloquent tongue used by Kalidasa  
    and Sankara -- or even the epics.  It dispenses with such frills as  
    the dual and many verb forms.  I asked him if he had read Sanskrit  
    literature -- poetry, darsana, whatever.  He seemed nonplussed by the  
    question -- he spoke Sanskrit; why should he read Kalidasa?  I felt he  
    was entirely ignorant of the intellectual grandeur and scope of the  
    language and spoke it (or his version of it) merely to make a  
    statement.  I would remark parenthetically that the use of Sanskrit in  
    a Malayalam historical novel I once read -- including 3-line Sanskrit  
    compounds -- was far more sophisticated than this "Sanskrit" speaker  
    could have managed.  If he had studied the literature of Kannada --  
    which I suspect was his real native language -- his Sanskrit would  
    certainly have been much better.  George Hart

    Dear Hart,
    Do you know that there are fourteen Sanskrit Vidyapeetha in India, and
    six Sanskrit universities in Varanasi,Tirupati, Delhi,Jaipur etc.  where
    sanskrit is the media of teaching and all Professors and students speak
    Sanskrit. My mother toung was Sanskrit. My father Pandit Rampratap
    Shastri was Professor and Head of the Departrment of Sanskrit at the
    Nagpur university and I learnt Sanskrit with him as a  child and then at
    Varanasi I studied upto Shastri degree. I took my first Ph.D. in India
    and second at Sorbonne.I have  composed and published 15 Sanskrit Kavyas
    I still speak Sanskrit fluently. My latest Sanskrit Kavya is Satyam
    Universl Truth). I wonder if you have met any Professor or student of
    these institutions? With best regards,
    Rasik Vihari Joshi

    Dear Rasik Joshi Tripathi,

    I myself spoke Sanskrit for a year with pandits from the Sanskrit  
    Sanskrit college -- I made sure none of them knew English.  I became  
    pretty fluent, and was intrigued to discover that my wife, who is  
    Tamil and has studied Tamil literature thoroughly, could understand us  
    after a time.  Colloquial Tamil contains thousands of Sanskrit words,  
    though of course high Tamil uses pure Dravidian equivalents (e.g.  
    tuuymai for suddam < suddha).  Sanskrit syntax has been deeply  
    influenced by Dravidian -- and this is even more true of spoken  
    Sanskrit (bhavaan aagamisyati vaa, where the vaa replicates the  
    Dravidian interrogative -aa).  This no doubt made it easier for her to  
    understand.  The Sanskrit used by the pandits had, in my estimation,  
    very little in common with the language of the person from the  
    Sanskrit village.  They used the language sensitively, creatively, and  
    with a full knowledge of all its forms.  I remember once being taken  
    to task for using too many bhaave constructions, a convenient  
    workaround that, of course, enables one to avoid remembering all the  
    various verb conjugations.  It is certainly true that there are many  
    like yourself who are well-versed in Sanskrit even today.  A Tamil  
    gentleman living in the Bay Area recently presented me with a  
    composition -- quite well done -- he had written in Sanskrit on the  
    Titanic.  He had truly mastered the language.  George Hart

    Hello,

      In Malayalam, my native tongue, 60 to 70 percent words of the  
    language of an educated Malayalee are Sanskrit. In many Indian  
    languages the state of this affair will slightly change. Such people  
    need not make Sanskrit their spoken language. There is hidden agenda  
    behind popularising spoken Sanskrit. Hindu revivalists and  
    communalists are popularising it. They have organizations for the  
    same. At times of mass murders of people belonging to other religions  
    there is need to distinguish them. "Interested parties" have plans to  
    make Sanskrit the national language of India. A time may come when  
    during purposely created communal riots, the question will be put  
    "bhavaan samskrtam janaati kim?" Those who reply in the affirmative in  
    Sanskrit will be spared and others will be butchered.
    I am also fluent in Sanskrit and have evolved an easy  method for  
    teaching Spoken Sanskrit, not the spoken Sanskrit popularised by the  
    revivalists which is like "adya kati iddali bhakshitam?" "adya chayam  
    piitam kim?".
