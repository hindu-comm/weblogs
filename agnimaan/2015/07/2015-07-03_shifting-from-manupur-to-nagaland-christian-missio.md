Shifting from Manipur to Nagaland: Christian Missionaries resisted by vaiShNavism

From [this
thesis](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2669/Longkumer%20A%20thesis%2008%20small.pdf?sequence=2):

> Following the Charter Act of 1813, which stipulated that the British
> administration must take more responsibility for the religious and
> moral improvement of the people of India (Chaube 1999: 53), William
> Carey of the Serampore mission sent his first convert, Krishna Chandra
> Pal, to work among the Khasis of Sylhet on the invitation of the
> British magistrate of Sylhet. Pal’s mission yielded seven converts,
> all of whom were encouraged by the enthusiastic magistrate to be
> baptised immediately before instruction. Other missionaries were also
> operating from the Assam side into the Naga Hills. F. W. Clark,
> another American Baptist Missionary, started his work from Assam in
> 1871 to penetrate the Ao Naga country.
>
> 158 Subsequently, due to the interest in missions providing a
> humanitarian resource for the administrators, primarily in the field
> of education, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (ABFMS) was
> invited from Burma. They set up their office in Manipur in 1894, after
> an initial attempt in 1836 failed due to opposition from the local
> government, who had made Vaishnavite Hinduism the main religion by a
> royal edict in 1705 (Dena 1988: 31). This was followed by an
> autonomous mission society called Arthington Aboriginese Mission
> Society (AAMS) funded by a wealthy millionaire, Robert Arthington from
> Leeds, United Kingdom. Its minister, Rev. Pettigrew, was the first
> official missionary to receive full patronage from a British official
> (Mr. A. Porteous, the Political Agent of Manipur) in the region.
> Arthington’s concept was based on the idea that ‘every tribe in every
> land shall have the Gospel’ (Dena 1988: 32). Pettigrew’s intention was
> to penetrate the largely Vaishnavite Manipuri population. But the
> Manipuri people saw his intentions as imperialistic and connected with
> the British government policy. Due to this setback, he shifted his
> focus to the hill inhabitants, primarily the Nagas and Kukis.
