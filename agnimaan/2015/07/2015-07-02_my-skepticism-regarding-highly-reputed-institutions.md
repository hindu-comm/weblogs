My skepticism regarding highly reputed institutions.

-   Consider taking a class from MIT – with a catch – you are one of
    100000 people taking the course, with hardly any opportunity to have
    a deep interaction with the teacher or the assistants.
-   Consider visiting the Tirupati main shrine, to get a 5 second
    glimpse of the deity before being pushed out by the “jaragaNDi”
    shouting prabandhaka-s.
-   Consider visiting an super popular ascetic (say the XYZ jagadguru),
    with whom the only interaction you will probably have is to be given
    a fruit after doing a namaskAra (if that).

Inference:

-   In all these cases, popularity implies less individual attention and
    opportunity.
-   I feel that there is hubris without substance on the part of most
    patrons. “I went to MIT” or “I visited Tirupati” or “I am a shiShya
    ofthe most holy jagadguru” is what counts for them rather than “I
    learned statistical mechanics” or “I experienced a beautiful pUja”
    or “I got some great spiritual insight and progress” (since these
    things can be had from lesser known institutions and individuals,
    even remotely).
-   I suspect that the institutions in question have an incentive to
    keep up the hype to get such disproportionate patronage.

Conclusion.

-   Hence, I don’t like to patronizeoverly popular institutions
    (temples or courses).
-   EDIT: Note important qualifications and corrections noted by

Extensions.

-   People oftenaffiliatewith certain spiritual paths/ traditions
    rather than others because they increase their status amongst peers
    (eg: clansfolk); rather than because they are genuinely superior to
    others. So, “I chant the veda-s, do this and that sAdhana which is
    rigorous” or “I do this research on this HOT topic” is suspect. Too
    often, one does not ask oneself: Is the hype justified or not?
