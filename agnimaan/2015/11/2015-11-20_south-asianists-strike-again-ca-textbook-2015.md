South Asianists strike again : CA textbook 2015.

Please note“**Hindu religion studies Faculty Review of Proposed
California Curriculum Framework**“

FACULTYstatements have a MUCH higher weight in the eyes of the
Framework committee than us “public”. We need a “**Hindu religion
studies Faculty Review of Proposed California Curriculum Framework**“
to present our side.

Upon reading their production, I finally understandthe words of the

Asian” instead of “Hindu” or “India” is an enemy of “Hindus”. More
