Handguns in Hindu military – why the slow adoption?

Part of pANDuranga kANe’s criticism of Shivaji – (I paraphrase) – “His
daddy bought guns from the foreigners, but he didn’t even think of
opening an ammunitions factory!?”The little bit of Indian gun history
([article1](http://www.allsands.com/history/places/historyofgun_zzq_gn.htm))
I could find online indicates that Babuur used muskets to great effect.

But medieval Hinduarmies were mostly : Infantry, cavalry and artillery.
The infantry was mostly not equipped with hand-guns and hand-gun
tactics. Is this true? If so why? It turns out that this is false – See
responses to the Facebook
post[here](https://www.facebook.com/vishvas.vasuki/posts/10153070311757989:0).

**Effectiveness of a superior infantry**

Consider the consequence of this. Battle of Assaye (1803) (where the
\~50k Maratha infantrydid include a 10k well equipped European trained
infantry) shows the consequence of this inferior infantry, as described
in the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Assaye):  
“The Maratha cannonade punched holes in the British line, but the
infantry maintained a steady pace, closing up the gaps in their ranks as
they advanced. The 78th Highlanders were the first to reach the enemy in
the southern sector next to the River Kailna. They paused 50 yards
(46m) from the Maratha gunners and unleashed a volley of
[musket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket "Musket") fire before
launching into a bayonet charge. …The gunners stood by their cannon but
were no match for the bayonets of the British and Madras troops who
swiftly pressed on towards the Maratha infantry….They were not trained
to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and
did not play a further part in the battle.”

**Comparison with East Asians**

Wiki [says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket): “In Japan, muskets
were introduced in 1543 by Portuguese merchantmen and by the 1560s were
being mass-produced locally.” Popular records state that the daimyo Oda
Nobunaga revolutionized musket tactics in Japan by inventing the
Maurice-style three-line formation at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575 as
an effective check on the massed cavalry charges then in use by his
Takeda rival. The total victory he won at this battle quickly led other
daimyo to acquire muskets in large quantities, which proved highly
effective during the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 1590s ordered by
Toyotomi Hideyoshi. At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, nearly 20,000
muskets were used, comparable to if not greater than the numbers
employed on contemporary European battlefields.

Similarly, consider Korea
(Wiki[says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket): “in the King
[Sukjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukjong_of_Joseon "Sukjong of Joseon")era
(1700’s), the 76.4% of the local standing army in
[Chungcheong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungcheong "Chungcheong")
region’s army list were musketeers.”).

    -   Jason notes on ShAhAjI – “not certain about Sivājī-but his
        eldest son commissions a work on firearms and their use in
        marathi that seems to have been adopted by the army as a
        reference right away”
