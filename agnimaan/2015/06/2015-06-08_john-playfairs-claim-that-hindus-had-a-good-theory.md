John Playfair’s claim that Hindus had a good theory of gravity (late 1700-s)

“Gravity was discovered by Newton? Lol. Read John Playfair’s treatise
from 1794 where he clearly says that the Hindus knew about gravity
around 4500BC. The Sanskrit root “grah” means to grab/to attract/ and is
used to describe celestial bodies.”

So I dug up the reference: <http://i.imgur.com/Idpe7rp.png> – and it is
true that John Playfair had an opinion of this sort. ( [Google Books

That (some English contemporary of Newton saying this) doesn’t
necessarily mean the claim was right, of course. Computing planetary
positions does not necessarily require a theory of gravity as clear as
Newton’s.
