On the vitality of sanskrit:<http://i.imgur.com/05TVh3O.png>

-   Above all, let those who are preparing for an Indian career bear in
    mind that Sanskrit is the only source of life, health and vigour to
    all the spoken languages of the Hindus, the only repository of Hindu
    religious creeds, customs and observances.

Sanskrit and Vedanga education

-   I made a point of visiting the well-known Sanskrit Tols at Nuddea,
    and found them frequented by students from all parts of India, some
    learning grammar, which may occupyfrom seven to twelve years ; some
    law, which may require a ten years’ course ; and a large number
    studying the Nyaya system of logic, which may necessitate from
    thirteen to twenty-two years’ curriculum. Both teachers and stu
    dents in these schools of learning are of course Brahmans.from
    seven to twelve years ; some law, which may require a ten years’
    course ; and a large number studying the Nyaya system of logic,
    which may necessitate from thirteen to twenty-two years’ curriculum.
    Both teachers and stu dents in these schools of learning are of
    course Brahmans. …
-   I also visited schools of native learning in other parts of India,
    and arrived at the conclusion that the old type of Pandit, trained
    to repeat whole departments of Sanskrit literature by heart, is
    dying out. On the other hand, it seemed to me that Sanskrit
    learning, as encouraged by us and learnt on principles of European
    philology, is decidedly on the increase.

The effect of English education:

-   “On the contrary, English has scarcely made its way at all among the
    masses of the people. Nevertheless, the cultivation of the language
    of the ruling race is becoming increasingly common at all the
    principal towns. It is taught at all Government and Missionary
    Schools and Colleges, and even at all larger native schools.
    Everywhere I found it both cultivated and spoken fluently by most
    educated Indians — to the neglect, I am sorry to say, of their own
    vernacular languages.”

A significant remark on castes:

-   State of some widows
    -   Such a widow belongs for ever to her dead husband. A widower may
        marry again, but a widow never. She is made a household drudge.
        She is expected to get up at four a.m. before the servants of
        the family. No one will supply her with water. She must go to
        the well and fetch water for herself. It is unlucky to meet her.
        She is supposed to be in eternal mourning for her deceased lord,
        though she may never have seen him except at her child-wedding.
        She must practise a perpetual fast, and only eat one meal a day.
        If her young husband had acquired property of his own before his
        death and the household is still undivided, all such pro perty
        is taken by her brothers-in-law. She retains nothing but her
        ornaments, which she must on no account wear. She is told that
        she cannot have food given to her till she has ‘ eaten her
        jewels.’ In other words, she is expected to sell her ornaments
        to prevent herself from starving. In short, she suffers a living
        death, and would often cheerfully give herself up to be burnt,
        if the law would allow her.
