Portrayal of muslims in kAlachakra-tantra

Link to the article from which most of this post is copied):

In Sanskrit literature the Kalacakra tantra is unique in presenting a
fairly comprehensive and quite accurate portrayal of Islamic beliefs and
practices.

-   “What, then, are the beliefs of the followers of Muhammad? The
    mleccha Tayin worship a mighty, merciless, demonic death-deity named
    arRahman (rahman). …By satisfying ar-Rahman a man achieves bliss in
    heaven; by displeasing ar-Rahman a man suffers in hell.At death a
    man is judged by ar-Rahman, and experiences his destiny in heaven or
    hell in that very corporeal human form. …The Tayin reject the
    Buddhist notion that a person’s experiences are the results of his
    karma; they reject the concept of reincarnation (1.10); and they
    deny that there is any sort of nirvana beside the achievement of
    heaven (1.14).”
-   “The mlecchas slit the throats of animals while saying the mantra of
    their demonic deity Visavimla, ‘Withered by Poison’; that is,
    bismillah – “in the name of Allah” (1.1; cf. III.l).24 …Tayin
    ascetics dine after sundown and at night (1.6; IV.2).” “Mleccha
    prayer practices are also noteworthy. The Tayin first wash, then
    they bow down, five times each day: at noon, in the afternoon, in
    the evening, at midnight, and at sunrise (II.4). When praising their
    deity they kneel (1.6), and draw in their limbs like a tortoise
    (1.12). …The Tayin cut the skin from the tips of their penises26 as
    a cause for happiness in heaven” (IV.2). …Barbarian iconoclasm is
    also mentioned: the Tayin cavalry conduct raids to destroy Buddhist
    and non-Buddhist temples containing anthropomorphic images (II.4;
    cf. 11.5,6; 1.8).”
-   “The Kalacakra tantra represents Islam as a religion of violence
    (himsadharma) that advocates savage behavior (raudra-karman) (1.6).
    …”

**Buddhist Strategies for Dealing with Islam**

-   “First, the tantra prohibits its own adherents from participating in
    the barbarian religion. Second, it holds out the possibility of
    converting the barbarians to Buddhism. Third, it uses the threat of
    Islam in antibrahman polemics. Finally, it prophesies a Buddhist
    holy war against Islam.” (with an emphasis on the last)

**Appraisal**

-   “There is no discernible attempt to portray Muslims as monsters by
    falsifying or distorting their ideology and behavior. On the
    contrary, the texts even report that the barbarians are truthful,
    clean, honest, and chaste. Although the authors clearly found Islam
    to be exotic and evil, they appear to have faithfully recorded their
    observations of it.”
-   “Indeed, it is quite remarkable that in terms of comprehensiveness,
    detail, and accuracy the Kalacakra’s representation of Islam is
    superior to the sum total of pre-modern Muslim knowledge of
    Buddhism.”
-   An esoteric/ spiritual meaning is ascribed to the Islam-Buddhist
    struggle.
-   “Thus the Kalacakra’s representation of Islam can be viewed as an
    example of the tendency in classical Indian religions to represent
    historical events in mythic, trans-historical terms.“
-   PS: These aspects of the kAlachakra teachings have been studied by
    attentive modern muslims, of course
