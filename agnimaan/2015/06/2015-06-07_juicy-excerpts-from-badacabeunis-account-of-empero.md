**Summary of the factors that led to apostacy**

Mullah ʿ[Abd-ul-Qadir
Bada’uni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%60Abd_al-Qadir_Bada%27uni) (c.
1540 – 1615) summarizes: “The following are the principal reasons which
led His Majesty from the right path.” (I’ve rearranged and
bullet-pointedthepassages for coherence.) …

-   The **principal reason is the large number of learned men of all
    > denominations and sects that came from various countries to court,
    > and received personal interviews.** Night and day people did
    > nothing but enquire and investigate; profound points of science,
    > the subtleties of revelation, the curiosities of history, the
    > wonders of nature, of which large volumes could only give a
    > summary abstract, were ever spoken of. His Majesty collected the
    > opinions of every one, especially of such as were not Muhammadans,
    > retaining whatever he approved of, and rejecting everything which
    > was against his disposition, and ran counter to his wishes. …

    -   Moreover **Sumanīs and Brahmins managed to get frequent private
        > interviews** with His Majesty. As they surpass other learned
        > men in their treatises on morals, and on physical and
        > religious sciences, and reach a high degree in their knowledge
        > of the future, in spiritual power and human perfection, they
        > brought proofs, based on reason and testimony, \[S. 189\] for
        > the truth of their own, and the fallacies of other religions,
        > and inculcated their doctrines so firmly, and so skilfully
        > represented things as quite self-evident which require
        > consideration, that no man, by expressing his doubts, could
        > now raise a doubt in His Majesty, even if mountains were to
        > crumble to dust, or the heavens were to tear asunder.

        -   He listened to every abuse which the courtiers heaped on our
            > glorious and pure faith, which can be so easily followed;
            > and eagerly seizing such opportunities, he shewed in words
            > and gestures, his satisfaction at the treatment which his
            > original religion received at their hands.

        -   When orders, in opposition to the Islām, were quoted by
            > people of other religions, they were looked upon by His
            > Majesty as convincing, whilst Hinduism is in reality a
            > religion, in which every order is nonsense.

        -   The **Originator of our belief, the Arabian Saints, all were
            > said to be adulterers, and highway robbers, and all the
            > Muhammadans were declared worthy of reproof,** till at
            > length His Majesty belonged to those of whom the Qur’ān
            > says (Sūr. 61, 8:) “They seek to extinguish God’s light
            > with their mouths: but God will perfect his light, though
            > the infidels be averse \[S. 194\] thereto.”

        -   In fact matters went so far, that proofs were no longer
            > required when **anything connected with the Islām was to
            > be abolished.**“

-   From his earliest childhood to his manhood, and from his manhood to
    > old age, His Majesty has passed through the most various phases,
    > and through all sorts of religious practices and sectarian
    > beliefs, and has collected every thing which people can find in
    > books, with a **talent of selection peculiar to him, and a spirit
    > of enquiry opposed to every \[Islāmitic\] principle**. …

    -   Once the emperor, in Fathu’llāh’s presence, said to Bīr Baṛ, “I
        > really wonder **how any one in his senses can believe that a
        > man, whose body has a certain weight, could, in the space of a
        > moment, leave his bed, go up to heaven, there have 90,000
        > conversations with God, and yet on his return find his bed
        > still warm?**” So also was the splitting of the moon
        > ridiculed. “Why,” said His Majesty, lifting up one foot, “it
        > is really impossible for me to lift up the other foot! What
        > silly stories men will believe.” And that wretch (Bīr Baṛ) and
        > some other wretches—whose names be forgotten—said, “Yea, we
        > believe! Yea, we trust!”

    -   “In the same manner, **every doctrine and command of the
        > Islām**, whether special or general, as the prophetship, the
        > harmony of the Islām with reason, the doctrines of *Ru’yat*,
        > *Taklīf*, and *Takwīn*, the details of the day of resurrection
        > and judgment,—**all were doubted and ridiculed.** \[S. 206\]
        > And if any one did object to this mode of arguing, his answer
        > was not accepted.

    -   the emperor examined people about the creation of the Qur’ān,
        > elicited their belief, or otherwise, in revelation, and raised
        > doubts in them regarding all things connected with the prophet
        > and the imāms. He distinctly **denied the existence of
        > *Jinns*, of angels, and of all other beings of the invisible
        > world**, as well as the miracles of the prophet and the
        > saints; he rejected the successive testimony of the witnesses
        > of our faith, the proofs for the truths of the Qur’ān as far
        > as they agree with **man’s reason**, the existence of the soul
        > after the dissolution of the body, and future rewards and
        > punishments in as far as they differed from metempsychosis.

-   there grew, gradually as the outline on a stone, the conviction in
    > his heart that **there were sensible men in all religions, and
    > abstemious thinkers, and men endowed with miraculous powers, among
    > all nations**.If some true knowledge was thus everywhere to be
    > found, why should truth be confined to one religion, or to a creed
    > like the Islām, which was comparatively new, and scarcely a
    > thousand years old …

    -   But sensible people smiled, and said, it was strange that His
        > Majesty should have such a faith in the Khwājah of Ajmīr,
        > whilst he rejected the foundation of everything, our prophet,
        > from whose ‘skirt’ hundreds of thousands of saints of the
        > highest degree had sprung.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Anecdotes concerning interactions with Brahmana-s, Birbal and other
Hindus; alsothe Zoroastrians:**

-   For some time His Majesty called a Brahmin, whose name was
    > Purukhotam author of a commentary on the .., whom he asked to
    > invent particular **Sanscrit names for all things in existence.**

-   At other times, a Brahmin of the name of Debī was pulled up the wall
    > of the castle, sitting on a *chārpāi*, till he arrived near a
    > balcony where the emperor used to sleep. Whilst thus suspended, he
    > instructed His Majesty in the **secrets and legends of Hinduism,
    > in the manner of worshipping idols, the fire, the sun and stars,
    > and of revering the chief gods of these unbelievers, as Brahma,
    > Mahādev, Bishn, Kishn, Rām, and Mahāmāī**, who are supposed to
    > have been men, but very likely never existed, though some, in
    > their idle belief, look upon them as gods, and others as angels.
    > His Majesty, on hearing further how much the people of the country
    > prized their institutions, commenced to look upon them with
    > affection. The doctrine of the transmigration of souls especially
    > took a deep root in his heart, and he approved of the saying,
    > —”There is no religion in which the doctrine of transmigration has
    > not taken firm root.” Insincere flatterers composed treatises, in
    > order to fix the evidence for this doctrine; and as His Majesty
    > relished enquiries into the sects of these infidels (who cannot be
    > counted, so numerous they are, and who have no end of \[S. 190\]
    > revealed books, but nevertheless, do not belong to the *Ahl-i
    > Kitāb* (Jews, Christians, and Muhammadans), not a day passed, but
    > a new fruit of this loathsome tree ripened into existence.

-   Here Badāonī mentions the **translations from Sanscrit into
    > Persian**, which have been alluded to above, p. 104. It is not
    > quite certain whether the translations were made from Sanscrit, or
    > from Hindī translations, or from both. Badāonī clearly states that
    > for some translations, as as the **Atharban**, Hindus were used as
    > interpreters. For other works as the **Mahābhārat**, there may
    > have been Hindī translations or extracts, because Akbar himself
    > (*vide* p. 105, note 1) translated passages to Naqīb Khān.
    > Abū’l-Fazl also states that he was assisted by Paṇḍits when
    > writing the fourth book of the Ā’īn. Compare Sir H. Elliott’s
    > Index to the Historians of India, p. 259.

-   His Majesty had also **one thousand and one Sanscrit names of the
    > Sun** collected, and read them daily, devoutly turning towards the
    > sun; he then used to get hold of both ears, and turning himself
    > quickly round about, used to strike the lower ends of the ears
    > with his fists. He also adopted several other practices connected
    > with sun-worship. He used to wear the **Hindu mark on his
    > forehead**, and ordered the band to play at midnight and at break
    > of day.

    -   No sooner had His Majesty finished saying the 1001 names of the
        > ‘Greater Luminary’, and stepped out into the balcony, than the
        > whole crowd prostrated themselves.

-   An incarnation of Vishnu (Kalki)?!
    -   Cheating, thieving Brahmins collected another set of 1001 \[S.
        > 212\] names of ‘His Majesty the Sun,’ and told the emperor
        > that **he was an incarnation, like Rām, Kishn, and other
        > infidel kings**; and though Lord of the world, he had assumed
        > his shape, in order to play with the people of our planet.

    -   In order to flatter him, they also brought Sanscrit verses, said
        to have been taken from the sayings of ancient sages, in which
        it was predicted that a great conqueror would **rise up in
        India, who would honour Brahmins and cows, and govern the earth
        with justice.**

-   Birbal!
    -   Bīr Baṛ also impressed upon the emperor that the **sun was the
        > primary origin of every thing.** The ripening of the grain on
        > the fields, of fruits and vegetables, the illumination of the
        > universe, and the lives of men, depended upon the Sun. Hence
        > it was but proper to worship and reverence this luminary; and
        > people in praying should face towards the place where he
        > rises, instead of turning to the quarter where he sets.

    -   For similar reasons, said Bīr Baṛ, should men pay regard to fire
        > and water, stones, trees, and other forms of existence, even
        > to cows and their dung, to the mark on the forehead and the
        > Brahminical thread.

    -   His Majesty also adopted different suits of clothes of seven
        > different colours, \[S. 193\] each of which was worn on a
        > particular day of the week in honour of the seven colours of
        > the seven planets.

    -   when Bīr Bar—that hellish dog— made a sneering remark at our
        > religion, Shahbāz abused him roundly, and said, “You cursed
        > infidel, do you talk in this manner? It would not take me long
        > to settle you.” It got quite uncomfortable, when His Majesty
        > said to Shahbāz in particular, and to the others in general,
        > “Would that a shoefull of excrements were thrown into your
        > faces.”

-   Hindu princesses
    -   **Beef was interdicted, and to touch beef was considered
        > defiling**. The reason of this was that, from his youth, His
        > Majesty had been in company with Hindu libertines, and had
        > thus learnt to look upon a cow—which in their opinion is one
        > of the reasons why the world still exists—as something holy.

    -   Besides, the Emperor was subject to the influence of the
        > numerous Hindu princesses of the Harem, who had gained so
        > great an ascendancy over him, as to make **him forswear beef,
        > garlic, onions, and the wearing of a beard**, which things His
        > Majesty still avoids.

    -   He had also introduced, though modified by his peculiar views,
        > Hindu customs and heresies into the court assemblies, and
        > introduces them still, in order to please and win the Hindus
        > and their castes; **he abstained from everything which they
        > think repugnant to their nature**, and **looked upon shaving
        > the beard as the highest sign of friendship and affection**
        > for him. Hence this custom has become very general.

-   **Fire-worshippers** also had come from Nausārī in Gujrāt, and
    > proved to His Majesty the truth of Zoroaster’s doctrines. They
    > called fire-worship ‘the great worship,’ and impressed the emperor
    > so favourably, that he learned from them the religious terms and
    > rites of the old Pārsīs, and ordered Abū’l-Fazl to make
    > arrangements, that sacred fire should be kept burning at court by
    > day and by night, according to the custom of the ancient Persian
    > kings, in whose fire-temples it had been continually burning; for
    > fire was one of the manifestations of God, and ‘a ray of His
    > rays.’

    -   His Majesty, from his youth, had also been accustomed to
        > celebrate the ***Hom* (a kind of fire-worship)**, from his
        > affection towards the Hindu princesses of his Harem.

-   Yogi-s
    -   His Majesty also called some of the **Jogīs**, and gave them at
        > night private interviews, enquiring into abstruse truths;
        > their articles of faith; their occupations; the influence of
        > pensiveness; their several practices and usages; the power of
        > being absent from the body; or into alchemy, physiognomy, and
        > the power of omnipresence of the soul. His Majesty even
        > learned alchemy, and shewed in public some of the gold made by
        > him.

    -   Once a year also during a night called ***Sīvrāt***, a great
        > meeting was held of all Jogīs of the empire, when the emperor
        > **ate and drank with the principal Jogīs**, who promised him
        > that he should **live three and four times as long as ordinary
        > men**. His Majesty fully believed it, and connecting their
        > promises with other inferences he had drawn, he got quite
        > convinced of it.

    -   Thus they said, it was mentioned in some holy books that men
        > used to live up to the age of one thousand years, whilst in
        > Sanscrit books the ages of some men were put down as ten
        > thousand years; and in Thibet, there were even now a class of
        > *Lāmās*, or Mongolian devotees, and recluses, and hermits,
        > that live two hundred years, and more. For this reason, His
        > Majesty, **in imitation of the usages of these Lāmās, limited
        > the time he spent in the Harem, curtailed his food and drink,
        > but especially abstained from meat**. He also shaved the hair
        > of the crown of his head, and let the hairs at the sides grow,
        > because he believed that the soul of perfect beings, at the
        > time of death, passes out by the crown (which is the tenth
        > opening of the human body) under a noise resembling thunder …

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Encounters with others:**

-   But he was soon left behind by Bīr Baṛ—that bastard!—and by Shaykh
    > Abū’l-Fazl, and Hakīm Abu’l-Fath, who successfully turned the
    > emperor from the Islām, and led him to reject inspiration,
    > prophetship, the miracles of the prophet and of the saints, and
    > even the whole law, so that I could no longer bear their company….

-   “His Majesty had also the early history of the Islām read out to
    > him, and soon commenced to think less of the Ṣaḥābah. Soon after,
    > the observance of the five prayers and the fasts, and the belief
    > in **every thing connected with the prophet, were put down as
    > taqlīdī, or religious blindness, and man’s reason was acknowledged
    > to be the basis of all religion**. …

-   As the Shaykh was not overstrict in acting according to our
    > religious law, he spoke a great deal of the pantheistic presence,
    > which idle **Ṣūfīs** will talk about, and which generally leads
    > them to denial of the law and open heresy. …The Shaykh is
    > therefore one of the principal culprits, who weakened His
    > Majesty’s faith in the orders of our religion. He also said that
    > infidels would, of course, be kept for ever in hell, but it was
    > not likely, nor could it be proved, that the punishment in hell
    > was eternal.

-   Learned monks also came from Europe, who go by the name of
    > ***Pādre**.* They have an infallible head, called *Pāpā.*He can
    > change any religious ordinances as he may think advisable, and
    > kings have to submit to his authority. …These accursed monks
    > applied the description of cursed Satan, and of his qualities, to
    > Muḥammad, the best of all prophets—God’s blessings rest on him and
    > his whole house!—a thing which even devils would not do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Influence on others’ apostacy and attempts at effecting the decline of
Islam:**

-   “They were admitted as disciples in sets of twelve, one set at a
    > time, and **declared their willingness to adopt the new
    > principles, and to follow the new religion**. Instead of the usual
    > tree, His Majesty gave his likeness, upon which the disciples
    > looked as a symbol of faith and the advancement of virtue and
    > prosperity.

    -   wretches like Mīrzā Jānī, chief of Tattah, and other apostates,
        > wrote their confessions on paper as follows:—’I, such a one,
        > son of such a one, have willingly and **cheerfully renounced
        > and rejected the Islām** in all its phases, whether low or
        > high, as I have witnessed it in my ancestors, and have joined
        > the Divine Faith of Shāh Akbar, and declare myself willing to
        > sacrifice to him my property and life, my honour and
        > religion.’ And these papers—there could be no more effective
        > letters of damnation—were handed over to the Mujtahid
        > (Abū’l-Fazl) of the new Creed, and were considered a source of
        > confidence or promotion.

    -   During the Muharram of 1004, Ṣadr Jahān, muftī of the empire,
        > who had been promoted to a commandership of One Thousand,
        > joined the Divine Faith, as also his two over-ambitious sons;
        > and having taken the *Shaṣt* of the new religion, he ran into
        > the net like a fish, and got his *Hazārīship.* He even asked
        > His Majesty what he was to do with his beard, when he was told
        > to let it be. On the same day, Mullā Taqī of Shushtar joined,
        > who looks upon himself as the learned of all learned, and is
        > just now engaged in rendering the Shāhnāmah into prose,
        > according to the wishes of the emperor, using the phrase
        > *jallat* ‘*azmatu-hu wa* ‘*azza shānu-hu*, wherever the word
        > *Sun* occurs. Among others that joined were Shaykhzāda Gosāla
        > Khān of Banāras; Mullā Shāh Muḥammad of Shāhābād; and Ṣūfī
        > Aḥmad, who claimed to belong to the progeny of the famous
        > Muḥammad Ghaws. They all accepted the four degrees of faith,
        > and received appointments as Commanders from One Hundred to
        > Five Hundred, gave up their beards agreeably to the rules, and
        > thus looked like the youths in Paradise.

-   Relief for heathens!
    -   Hindus who, when young, had from pressure become Musalmāns, were
        > allowed to go back to the faith of their fathers.

    -   No man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and
        > every one should be allowed to change his religion, if he
        > liked.

    -   If a **Hindu woman fall in love with a Muhammadan**, and change
        > her religion, **she should be taken from him by force, and be
        > given back to her family**. People should not be molested, if
        > they wished to build churches and prayer rooms, or idol
        > temples, or fire temples.”

-   In opposition to the Islām, **pigs and dogs were no longer looked
    > upon as unclean**. A large number of these animals was kept in the
    > Harem, and in the vaults of the castle, and to inspect them daily,
    > was considered a religious exercise. The Hindus, who believe in
    > incarnations, said that the **boar belonged to the ten forms which
    > God Almighty had once assumed**.

-   **Circumcision was \[S. 217\] forbidden** before the age of twelve,
    > and was then to be left to the will of the boys.

-   It was also fo**rbidden to marry one’s cousins** or near relations,
    > because such marriages are destructive of mutual love. Boys were
    > not to marry before the **age of 16, nor girls before 14,**
    > because the offspring of early marriages was weakly.

    -   the story of the marriage night of the **Prophet with
        > *Ṣiddīqa*** was totally disapproved of.

    -   “No one was to marry more than one wife, except in cases of
        > barrenness; but in all other cases the rule was, ‘**One God,
        > and one wife**.’

    -   A **Hindu girl**, whose husband had died before the marriage was
        > consummated, **should not be burnt**. If, however, the Hindus
        > thought this a hardship, they should not be prevented (from
        > burning the girl); but then a Hindu widow should take the girl

        -   If a Hindu woman wished to be burnt with her husband, they
            > should not prevent her; but she should not be forced.

-   The **prayers of the Islām, the fast, nay even the pilgrimage, were
    > henceforth forbidden**. Some bastards, as the son of Mullā
    > Mubārak, a worthy disciple of Shaykh Abū’l-Fazl, wrote treatises,
    > in order to revile and ridicule our religious practices, of course
    > with proofs. His Majesty liked such productions, and promoted the
    > authors.

    -   Fourteen festivals also were \[S. 205\] introduced corresponding
        > to the feasts of the Zoroastrians; but the **feasts of the
        > Musalmāns and their glory were trodden down**, the Friday
        > prayer alone being retained, because some old, decrepit, silly
        > people used to go to it.

    -   Mosques and prayer-rooms were changed into store rooms, or given
        > to Hindu Chaukīdārs. For the word *jamā*‘*at* (public prayer),
        > His Majesty used the term *jimā*‘ (copulation), and for*hayya*
        > *ala*, he said *yalalā talalā.*

-   The **killing of animals on certain days was forbidden**, as on
    > Sundays, because this day is sacred to the Sun; during the first
    > eighteen days of the month of Farwardīn; the whole month of Ābān
    > (the month in which His Majesty was born); and on several other
    > days, to please the Hindus. This order was **extended over the
    > whole realm, and capital punishment was inflicted** on every one
    > \[S. 210\] who acted against the command. Many a family was
    > ruined. During the time of these fasts, His Majesty abstained
    > altogether from meat, as a religious penance, gradually extending
    > the several fasts during a year over six months and even more,
    > with the view of eventually discontinuing the use of meat
    > altogether.

    -   In 999, the flesh of oxen, buffaloes, goats, horses, and camels,
        > was forbidden.

-   **Playing with dice, and taking interest, were allowed**, and so in
    > fact was every thing else admitted which is forbidden in the
    > Islām.

-   “A second order was given that the **Sun should be worshipped four
    > times a day**, in the morning and evening, and at noon and

-   “People should be buried with their heads towards the east, and
    > their feet towards the west. His Majesty even commenced to sleep

-    Reading and **learning Arabic was looked upon as a crime**; and
    > Muhammedan law, the exegesis of the Qur’ān, and the Tradition, as
    > also those who studied them, were considered bad and deserving of
    > disapproval.

    -   Common people should no longer learn Arabic, because such people
        > were generally the cause of much mischief.

    -   In the same year the prohibition of the study of Arabic was
        > extended to all. People should learn Astronomy, Mathematics,
        > Medicine, and Philosophy. The Tārīkh of this order is *Fasād-i
        > fazl* (995).

    -   Even the letters which are peculiar to the Arabic language, as
        the ض ص ح ع ث, and ظ, were avoided.

-   **Astronomy, philosophy, medicine, mathematics, poetry, history, and

-   Names like ***Amad*, *Muḥammad*, *Muṣṭafa*, &c., became offensive to
    > His Majesty**, who thereby wished to please the infidels outside,
    > and the princesses inside, the Harem, till, after some time, those
    > courtiers who had such names, changed them; and names as *Yār
    > Muḥammad*, *Muḥammad Khān*, were altered to ***Ramat**.*

        > The **Arabs** have made such progress,  
        > That they now wish to get hold of the kingdom of Persia.  
        > Fie upon Fate! Fie upon Fate!“

    -   Similarly **other verses were eagerly seized**, if they conveyed
        a calumny, as the verses from the ……, in which the falling out
        of the teeth of our prophet is alluded to.

-   **Cases between Hindus should be decided by learned Brahmins**, and
    > not by Musalmān Qāzīs.
