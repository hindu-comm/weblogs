The parable of the kShatriya-s.

From [thisMT
article](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/the-dream-motif/):

> She intended look up the papers, which Somakhya had recommended, on
> staphylinids and ants from the early 1900s by a certain Ramakrishnan
> of Tanjavur. In those old papers she read that the staphylinids they
> had observed lay their eggs in the vicinity of the the *Formica* nest.
> Apparently guided by an olfactory cue the worker ants bring those eggs
> into the nest. Once inside, the ants attend to them like their own and
> the beetle larvae eventually hatch out. They are then fed by the ants
> until they reach a certain size when they start eating the ant larvae
> and as well as their own kin. Eventually, those that successfully make
> it come out and fly away as adults. Apparently, given that the
> staphylinids practice cannibalism their numbers never run away so as
> to cause a collapse of the ant colony. At the same time Lootika
> wondered if the cannibalism actually helped the fittest among them
> make it to the next generation. Lootika then thought of her vivid
> dream and of a subhāṣitam Somakhya had quoted from the wise
> Viṣṇuśarman:
>
> iśvarāṇām idaṃ tantraṃ prāyeṇautsukyam āvahet \|  
> yatas tiraścāṃ caritair nītimārgaḥ pradarśyate \|\|
>
> This text of the gods might appear puzzling due to its teachings;  
> However it intends illustrating by actions of animals the path of
> right politics.
