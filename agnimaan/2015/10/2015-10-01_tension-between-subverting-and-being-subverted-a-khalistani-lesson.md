Tension between subverting and being subverted – a khAlistani lesson

Funny anecdotes via pratiika about khAlistAni nuts during the modi
visit-  
1. Outside FaceBook the sardarji-s face off with hindus. They keep
shouting anti-modi slogans. The hindus initially respond with the likes
of “bhaarat maata ki jai”. Then, some hindu has a brilliant idea – the
hindus start shouting “jo bole so nihaal – sat sri akaal”. The turbans
are stumped.

2\. Outside Google, the sardaarji face off with hindus. This time they
get physical and push. Unlucky for them, the hindus include rather well
built haryANvi boxer types, who coolly respond by saying: “chal maar-
guru gobind singh ke naam pe maar”.

Both of these illustrates an potential positive, as well as a potential
negative.

1.  The positive is the prospect of taking over the inimical ideology
    (remember that sikhism is proto-islamophile-sickularism) by claiming
    that we know their philosophy and history better than they do.
    1.  If the opposing community is relatively tiny, this may well
        work.
        1.  Could sikhism be a potential example? Could our hindu
            friends, who as a whole are unparalleled experts at fooling
            themselves, may have done the right thing for the wrong
            reason?
    2.  If by contrast, the enemy islarge enough to control its own
        narrative, this wont work.
        1.  Islam is a clear example.
2.  The negative is the enormousdisastrous consequences of fooling
    oneself into toleratingan enemy and letting them prosper, or worse
    – taking them for friends.
