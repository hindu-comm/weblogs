Cow protection in other cultures

Following info I gained from a FB conversation.

-   “The Zoroastrian religion forbids cow flesh for consumption. The cow
    also figures symbolically in several aspects of that religion, and
    cow urine is drunk at the Navjote sacrament. It is another matter
    that Westernized Anglophile Parsis have ignored the dietary laws
    among many other things. … even until recently, cows were not a part
    of regular diet in Iran. It was during Westernization under the
    Qajar dynasty that the Brits & French introduced beef eating big
    time (which is now widespread in Iran). That shift was a traumatic
    cultural change, especially in the countryside. Watch the Persian
    movie “Gaav” (Cow)
    \[[YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gthjarCho)\], which
    depicts the attachment an Irani peasant has for his cow, and how the
    new beef industry sponsored cattle mafia snatch his kine from him,
    causing him to have a nervous breakdown. Khomeini, who was initially
    against film as a medium was convinced to allow the film industry to
    continue to operate after he watched that movie.”

-   Pakistanhas bannedfemale animal slaughter since 1963 –
    reinvigorated even in 2015 –
    [DA15](http://www.dawn.com/news/1199794).
-   Among the masai, cattle is slaughtered only in times of great need
    (eg – famine).

-   Japan
    -   Emperor Shomu (8th ce) had banned cow and horse slaughter. This
        was one of the justifications used by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to
        expel Jesuits.For centuries, it was taboo inJapan to kill cows
        (and more broadly other domestic animals) – wild game was
        allowed.\[[B](http://agrarianstudies.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/colloqpapers/18botsman.pdf)\]
    -   “Tsunayoshi’s “Laws of Compassion” are most closely
        associatedwith the protection of dogs, but as Tsukamoto points
        out, the laws he enacted regardingthe abandonment of sick
        cattle and horses were, in fact, both stricter and
        furtherreaching.”\[[B](http://agrarianstudies.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/colloqpapers/18botsman.pdf)\]
    -   Yet, almost as soon as the new“treaty port” of Kobe was
        openedto Western settlement in 1868,it began to develop a
        reputationfor its meat. The Tokugawa continued this ban.
