“Squaring of the circle by Srinivasa Ramanujan” :‌ A quote

> “There is a story about two friends, who were classmates in high
> school, talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician
> and was working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his
> former classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian
> distribution and the statistician explained to his former classmate
> the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, for the average
> population, and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not
> quite sure whether the statistician was pulling his leg. “How can you
> know that?” was his query. “And what is this symbol here?” “Oh,” said
> the statistician, “this is pi.” “What is that?” “The ratio of the
> circumference of the circle to its diameter.” “Well, now you are
> pushing your joke too far,” said the classmate, “surely the population
> has nothing to do with the circumference of the circle.” Naturally, we
> are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the classmate’s
> approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to admit to an
> eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the classmate betrayed
> only plain common sense.”But to us the vision of geometric
> construction, much more than algebra, brings home the fundamental
> symmetry in the action of the natural laws such as the above by
> linking it to the primary constant of the circle, which is perfectly
> symmetric. So at least we would not be so dismayed by the appearance
> of pi.
