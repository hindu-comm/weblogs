Status of the holy books in Hindu traditions : Updated opinion May 2015

## Status of the holy books

-   Hindus have sacred books (aka shAstra-s – Veda-s, epics including
    itihAsa-s, purANa-s, dharma-shAstra-s).
    -   Some injunctions of the shAstra-s are seriously (even
        fanatically) followed by the orthodox members of communities to
        whom they apply.
        -   Examples include:In case of brAhmaNa-s:Vegetarianism in
            non-sacrificial contexts.Not crossing the seas.Performing
            twilight salutations (sandhyA-vandanam) daily. etc..
        -   The motivation can either be ultimate liberation or lesser
            goals (comfort in this life or the next etc..)
            -   Holy books are considered extremely useful guides for
                beginner and intermediate spiritual practitioners.
                -   Partly for this reason, they are considered worthy
                    of preservation with great care.This despite the
                    many stories of sages throwing away or destroying
                    their personal copies when they found them useless
                    for further spiritual progress.
    -   Yet, plenty of people do transgress these injunctions without
        too much guilt, despite some censure.
-   But, these holy books are not absolute; and their injunctions are
    not binding regardless of context.
    -   Hindu traditions do not have the moral “ought” -rather they
        intend the word “should” – a statement of opinion that may
        require discussion and justification.
        -   (The distinction is explained [in this
            article](http://www.hipkapi.com/2011/03/18/ought-vs-should/)
            by a follower of shrI-bAlagangAdhara.)Summary: (a) ”You
            should not play with fire if you do not want to get burnt.”
            vs (b) “You ought not to torture fellow-human beings (if you
            want to remain a moral human being).” :Regarding (a): Is
            the statement valid if I wear a fire-proof suit, or I use a
            long non-conductive stick, or move a robot to do that using
            remote control? Of course not.
    -   From the point of view of an individual and the society, the
        idea that an injuction in a given shAstra (even if it is put in
        the mouth of a respected deity) is just one opinion issolidly
        established. One can espouse and follow whatever opinion one
        sees fit to a very large extant.Whence is this the case?
        -   Injunctions and practices of various Hindu traditions have
            contradicted each other without major conflicts. (Eg:
            rejection and acceptance of the 4-varNa-system,
            vedicsacrifices, appropriate rituals at life occasions such
            as birth, paths to spiritual liberation, the correct way of
            pronouncing the vedas,grammaticalcorrectness etc..) This
            geographic and temporal variation is expressly allowed by
            several commentators.
            -   Hindu legal system is not at all static. To quote from
                shrI-MT’s[survey on Hindu legal authorities of middle
                ages](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/01/05/south-indian-hindu-legal-authorities-of-the-middle-period/):
                “This brief survey shows that Hindu law was not static
                as is commonly painted in Leftist and secularist
                history-writing on India. While the legal issues were
                based on the earlier legal tradition comprising of
                dharma sUtras followed by the smRtis or the dharma
                shAstra, they typically diverged from their precedents.
                The divergence allowed discussion of new legal issues
                uncovered by the earlier legal sources and importantly
                account for the changing times. .. However, it should be
                kept in mind that many of the issues are mainly relevant
                to the Arya varNas and their pre-occupations.”
        -   Moral dilemmas (dharma-sankaTa) and controversies are rife
            in the Hindu epics (eg: arjuna’s dilemma over whether to
            fight the war, vAli questioning rAma-s decision to kill him,
            rAvaNa deciding whether the messenger Hanuman should be
            killed ormutilated).
        -   Several are sayings that denounce blithe reliance on “holy”
            texts:
            -   युक्तियुक्तं वचो ग्राह्यं बालादपि शुकादपि। युक्तिहीनं
                वचस्त्याज्यं वृद्धादपि शुकादपि॥
            -   “अश्व: शस्त्रं शास्त्रं वीणा वाणी नरश्च नारी च
                ।पुरुषविशेषं प्राप्ता भवन्त्ययोग्याश्च योग्याश्च ।।”
                पञ्चतन्त्रे मित्रभेदे ।
    -   Subjugation to the “ultimate reality”, and those that supposedly
        understand and experience it.
        -   Hindu texts themselves say that they are not the ultimate
            authority, and that a truly wise person should ultimately
            \*transcend\* (ie not be bound by) texts and adapt a
            worldview that is cognizant of the ultimate reality. So,
            guru-s can come along and abrogate the “holy” texts and the
            injunctions, adding their own voice to the pre-existing pool
            of opinions. So, Sanatana dharma is trans-textual in that
            sense.नमश् शास्त्रनिर्बन्धनिष्कासकेभ्यश्

            -   The[“knowing indra”
                text](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/19/knowing-indra/)fromchapter
                3 ofkaushitaki-upaniShad.
    -   Contrast with the Abrahamisms
        -   “Holy” books such as Bible, Torah and Quran are the ultimate
            arbiters of morality and conduct for Christians, Jews and
            Muslims respectively. In addition to this, Christians and
            Muslims consider the actions of Jesus and Muhammad
            respectively to varying degrees. As such, these religions
            are highly text-centric and rely on exclusive divine
            revelation – they call themselves “religions of THE book”,
            and consider themselves to be “true religions”.
        -   If the Abrahamic Holy Book is lost, the corresponding
            religion and its exclusive claims are lost. This being the
            case, congruence with the scripture becomes an existential/
            identity issue with Abrahamists. Hence, for them,
            transcending the texts becomes tougher than it is in the
            case of hindu-s who may blithely switch traditions or
            abandon beliefs. In the former case, one needs to say “I am
            not a Christian/ Muslim anymore.” In the case of Hindus and
            many Jews, one doesn’t need to say that. (And in the case of
            Jews, the ethnic identity remains despite loss of faith.)
        -   Given the history of conflict that does not tolerate
            divergent beliefs, traditional/ orthodox versions of these
            religions are, by default, hostile to other traditions. This
            is attenuated to some extant by the concept of “secularism”
            that arose as a result of internal strife in European
            Christendom, and due to the renaissance.
        -   Unlike Hinduism, it is extremely hard for Christian and
            Muslim religious leaders to crop up and change the
            scriptures finalized byJesus and Mohammed respectively.
            They just don’t have the theological provision for a
            pre-apocalyptic personalitywith authority tomatch these
            characters.
