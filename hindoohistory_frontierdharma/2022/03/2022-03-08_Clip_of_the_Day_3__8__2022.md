"S. Lal, former Hindu student at Oregon Agricultural College, reported to have been executed as an insurgent in India, attended college here in 1913-14..."

"In 1914 he applied for a transcript of his college records, evidently with the intention of entering the William Warren school, Palo Alto, California. He was known here as a quiet, cheerful, gentlemanly youth"
