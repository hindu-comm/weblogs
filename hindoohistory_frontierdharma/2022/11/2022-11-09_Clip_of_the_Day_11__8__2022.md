From The Washington Times, 1902:

“If a man who lived his whole life in Washington were put under the influence of a powerful opiate and carried, unaware, to the apartments of Mr. Edmund Russell, in the northwestern section of this city he would, on regaining consciousness, rub his eyes, stare about him and come to the conclusion that he had been transported by some occult power to the sleeping room of a rajah in India."

"Mr. Russell has recently returned from an extended tour through India and the decorations of his rooms-- gifts from the royalty of the Land of the Lotus-- are souvenirs of his journey…Because of this intimate association with the natives of India, he expects to write a book upon their country which will be unique, inasmuch as it will contain the truth without political, religious or racial prejudice"
