From the Atlanta Semi-Weekly Journal, 1910:

"Benares is a strange city. It is a place that one wishes to see and a place one wishes to leave. It is one of the old cities of the world, being older even than Rome"

"First we went to the Monkey temple. The real name is Durga temple,but Europeans call it Monkey temple because the place is infested with monkeys. The building is fairly pretentious but not beautiful. Within are images where Hindoos were worshipping and making offerings of flowers. At the entrance was a bloody place where goats are sacrificed. The whole place was filthy and the old priests were dirty and repulsive. Yet countless Hindoos, poor and otherwise, poured through the doors and worshipped the unattractive images"
