"HINDUS THREATEN NEW RACE PERIL" "Have you seen the Hindus, huddling together on the wastes of the flats, or, silent as their very Buddhist idols, stalking the streets of the city?"

"For from their sultry land of snakes and jungles and fevers, their gaudy turbans, their dark, strange visages, and their militant bearing would attract interested attraction and curious wonderment were it not for the fact that their presence foreshadows the coming of a new race peril. Fleeing from Bellingham, fleeing from British Columbia, and most with malevolent looks on every land.”
