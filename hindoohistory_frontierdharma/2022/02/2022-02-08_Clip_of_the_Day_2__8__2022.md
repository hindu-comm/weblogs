From the Maui News, 1902, the story of the “Orlov Diamond”

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d1d54d9-3235-4e0e-949d-77838fed2929_282x489.jpeg "Image")

"It is a curious fact and one scarcely known outside Russia, and there hardly ever mentioned that the famous Orloff diamond was once the right eye of the great idol Serringham in the temple of Brahma"

"The precious gem was stolen at about the beginning of the eighteenth century by a French soldier who had made pretense of being converted to the Hindoo religion in order to gain the confidence of the priests and admission to the temple"
