"The greatness of the conflict which is going on between heathenism and Christianity in India is little realized here in America. It is as it was at the beginning of our civil war when the people of the north had only the faintest idea of the terrible struggle which lay before them. Think of President Lincoln calling for only seventy-five thousand men for three months, just as though the great rebellion were to be put down by that insignificant force..."

"A similar struggle for the kingdom of God is being carried on in India: but it is a sad fact that but very few of the members of that kingdom in America have waked up to realize the greatness and the difficulty of the task which they have undertaken"

"In many respects the condition of things in India today closely resembles that in the Roman empire during the struggle between Christianity and heathenism. We have the great advantage in India of being under a Christian government."
