A Janmashtami special! Here are a few clips about Krishna, a Hindu deity who inspired especial fascination among American commentators:

From the American Union in 1857, a… curious theory about the origins of Krishna:

“The similarity of many particulars in the Puranic account ofKrishna to the incidents occurring in the life of our Savior, has often been noted by learned orientalists.THere is a strong circumstantial evidence that the Hindu Krishna is an invention of the Brahmins, intended to counteract Christianity…”

An ad for “Asia: The American Magazine on the Orient” published in the New York Herald in 1922, featuring an ad for a piece by James Bissett Pratt titled “Mahaban and Sri Krishna”

![“Mahaban and Sri Krishna: Did the Hindu get his god Krishna from the early Christians?”](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7d78b6c-ab9f-4334-96ca-d07b38ee44fd_812x540.jpeg "Image")

An ad for a performance by legendary American dancer Ruth St. Denis in London, where she reprises the role of Radha:

"Miss Ruth St. Denis, an American dancer, is appearing at the Scala theater, London, in some of the most unique dances ever presented. In the picture herewith she is portraying Radha, wife of Krishna, a Hindu god. She poses for a few minutes, then leaves the pedestal and goes through a weird dance. She has the most elaborate stage settings to carry out the Indian effect"
