From the progressive farmer and southern farm gazette., 1911:

"If it were any other country but India, I might write last of the religion the people profess, but since it is India, it is the first thing to be considered.

Certainly nowhere else on earth is there a country where the entire life of the people is so molded by the spiritual belief."

"About theoretical or philosophical Hinduism there is admittedly a certain measure of moral beauty, but to even get from this Hindu literature one must wade through cesspools of filth and obscenity and must shut his eyes to the pitiably low ideals of Deity, while in its practical manifestations modern Hinduism is the most sickening combination of superstition, idolatry, an d vice that now disgraces the name of religion in any considerable portion of the earth"
