# Gosava and Bovine Mimesis in Ritual-Part2

Potentially disturbing content ahead. The following article discusses a
rite the details of which are bound to disturb some Hindu readers. It is
***plainly*** not for everyone.

My heartfelt thanks and gratitude
to[śrīmānasa-taraṃgiṇī](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com) for
helping me with the translation of JB 2.113.8: “sā yemāṃ….” and taking
the time to explain the nuances to me.

6.  **Recapitulation**

This article must be read in conjunction with part 1 of this series,
[here](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/gosava-and-bovine-mimesis-in-ritual-part-1/).
However, the summary of the key preliminary points raised in part 1 is
presented as follows for the reader’s convenience.

i\. In **section 2** of part 1, we looked at the anaḍutsūkta of the
śaunakīya Atharvaveda (4.11) which is the oldest source used in this
discussion. The hymn did not discuss any imitation per se, but revolved
around a narrative of Indra’s manifesting as the bull (4.11.2).

ii\. If not similarities, we saw, in the **numbered points in sections 2
and 3**, noteworthy correspondences between the traditions of the
anaḍutsūkta and the gosava rite as described in taittiriya brāhmaṇa
2.7.6 as well as pañcaviṃśa brāhmaṇa 19.13, such as the centrality of
prajāpati and parameṣṭhin in all three texts. Another example would be
the ‘pouring of milk-streams’ meme, used as an imagery in anaḍutsūkta
(4.11.4) and performed as a ritual act of unction (abhiṣeka) over the
performer’s head (see **section 2 point iii, section 3, point iv**).

iii\. We also looked into the concept of svārājya in **section 3**,
**right after the numbered points in section 2**. The concise and subtle
comparison drawn, in **taittiriya brāhmaṇa 2.7.6.1.9-10**, between the
uninhibited behaviour of cattle and the unbounded independence one
obtains in being a sovereign was also noted by us. The concept of
svārājya seems to have been gradually transforming from that with a
worldly understanding of sovereignty in terms of political power, into
one with soteriological underpinnings (i.e. the question of boundless
freedom in the afterlife)

iv\. Lastly, in **section 4**, we looked at taittiriya brāhmaṇa 2.3.9.9
which seems to be one of the earliest textual traditions of bovine
mimesis or even animal imitation in general. Though TB 2.3.9.9 does not
directly relate to the gosava rite, it is significant for consideration
in the context of understanding the idea of bovine mimesis (imitation of
cattle, kine). Furthermore, it has clearly influenced the pāśupata
sutras.

7.  **The jaiminīya account of Gosava**

Having seen the brief summary of points of part 1, we can now look at
the account of the gosava rite as presented in the much-dreaded
jaiminīya text (This jaiminīya brāhmaṇa is a brāhmaṇa text proper and
not to be confused with the jaiminīya upaniṣad brāhmaṇa which is often
treated as a āraṇyaka). The original passage of 2.113 will be presented,
followed by a literal translation. (Will be adding a far more detailed
translation with explanation for the grammatical technicalities as soon
as possible. It is almost done.)

In the immediately following translation without explanation, the words
in square brackets would be words to be read as part of the text but are
not actually found in the original but inserted by me for the sole
purpose of making the sentence readily comprehensible and logical in
English. The words in circular brackets are explanatory.

athaiṣa gosavaḥ /1/ svargakāmo haitena yajeta /2/

Now this is \[the\] gosava /1/ \[He who is\] heaven desiring, indeed by

“Of that \[gosava\], what is the observance? What is the \[sacrificial\]

That is indeed an elderly man \[‘s\] sacrifice /34/ Thus, even so, in
the last years \[of one’s life\], let him sacrifice /35/

//End of Translation

Now, the above account offers a variant of the gosava rite that is
strikingly different when contrasted against the versions found in
taittiriya brāhmaṇa 2.7.6 and pañcaviṃśa brāhmaṇa 19.13 which we saw in
part 1. While the above account may be very shocking to some readers,
let us, with patience dissect the account of gosava as presented in the
jaiminīya.

Firstly, one may take into consideration the hypothesis by mlecchas such
as Caland that the jaiminīya account of gosava is descriptive of the
“primitive” version of the rite before a civilized ārya society
abandoned these “barbaric” aspects and transformed the rite into
something acceptable. However, a close reading of the jaiminīya text
does not seem to bear out this hypothesis.

i\. The text itself seems to be a composite of two distinct parts, with
the first part consisting of verses from 2.113.1 (athaiṣa gosavaḥ) to
2.113.15 (tasya dvādaśa…..svargasyaiva lokasya samaṣṭyai) and the second
part consisting of the rest of the verses, from 2.113.16 (tasya vratam)
to 2.113.35 (sa haiṣa… haitenottaravayasye yajeta). The first part
(2.113.1-2.113.15) of the jaiminīya account seems to be a reworking of
the typical gosava rite as embodied in the taittiriya and pañcaviṃśa
texts, retaining a certain few elements found in the latter two texts
while eschewing many other, key components of the rite.

ii\. The jaiminīya text mentions the ṣaṭtriṃśa stoma as the one to be
used in 2.113.3 (sa vā eṣa ṣaṭtriṃśo bhavati) and the use of both the
bṛhat and rathantara sāman-s in 2.113.12 (tasyobhe bṛhadrathantare
sāmanī bhavata). These, as we have seen in part 1, are found in the
taittiriya and pañcaviṃśa accounts of gosava. Refer to PB 19.13.5: ubhe
bṛhadrathantare bhavatas and TB 2.7.6.2.3 regarding the employment of
both sāman-s. With respect to the stoma to be used, refer to PB
19.13.10: sarvaḥ ṣaṭtriṃśastena gosavaḥ as well as TB 2.7.6.3.5. To this
extent, it does seem that a skeletal framework of the rite, in so far as
the liturgy is concerned (sāman-s and stoma), has been largely retained
by the jaiminīya-s. One can only say, ‘largely retained’ as even the
liturgical aspect of gosava is not fully intact. For instance, in the
2.113.9, the ṣaṭtriṃśa stoma is not to be chanted in the conventional
manner but instead as four trivṛt stoma-s (tasya stotraṃ stotraṃ
caturaścaturastrivṛto’bhisaṃpadyate).

To appreciate this, the reader should note that the trivṛt stoma
consists of (trivṛt meaning threefold three verses repeated in each of
three turns/paryāya) a total of nine verses). Instead of chanting the
thirty six verses within the three paryāya-s, a nine-versed trivṛt stoma
is chanted within the three paryāya-s and four such trivṛt stoma-s are
performed. This peculiar liturgical structure (of four trivṛt stoma-s)
is metaphorically described in 2.113.11 as a yoke of four \[horses\] (sa
yathā kṣiprāśvena caturyujā) by means of which the performer of the rite
is speedily conveyed to the heavenly world. This is a beautiful example
of how non-liturgical aspects of a ritual are embedded in the structure
of the liturgy or the hymn. Another example of that would be the
sāmidhenī chant as discussed by the ārya here and here.

iii\. However, several other, key elements are completely absent in the
jaiminīya account, which can be found in the taittiriya and pañcaviṃśa
accounts. In both of these texts, an abhiṣeka rite is enjoined where
milk is poured over the sacrificer’s head (PB 19.13.7
pratiduhābhiṣicyate, TB 2.7.6.2.7). The unction is performed at the time
of chanting of the bṛhat sāman (PB 19.13.8 bṛhataḥ stotra
pratyabhiṣicyate, TB 2.7.6.2.9) and to the south of the āhavanīyāgni on
unraised, flat ground. Furthermore, the deities, prajāpati and
parameṣṭhin are totally absent in the jaiminīya text whereas they are
mentioned in the other two (PB 19.13.3 prajāpatir hi svārājyaṃ
parameṣṭhī svārājyam, TB 2.7.6.1.8). Most fundamentally, the term,
‘svārājya’ is conspicuously and completely missing in the jaiminīya
while, on the other hand, it is the stated objective in PB and TB.
Instead, the desired goal of the jaiminīya text is svarga loka (the
heavenly world, i.e. heaven). This disappearance of svārājya explains
the absence of the rite of sitting to the south of the āhavanīya fire on
unraised ground (TB 2.7.6.2.9, PB 19.13.9: anuddhate=not lifted up
ground, locative form of anuddhata) as the purpose of sitting on such
flat ground was that there should be nothing interposing (such as a hump
on uneven ground) between earth and the performer of the gosava, so as
to facilitate attainment of svārājya, or sovereignty. It hardly requires
much imagination to understand the correspondence (bandhutā) between
earth (over which power is exercised) and the attainment of that
sovereign power, i.e. svārājya. The sitting on unraised ground would
have been clearly an irrelevant rite for the jaiminīya-s who
contemplated the attainment of the other world and not sovereignty in
the kṣatra sense of the term.

However, we may note that, notwithstanding the absence of any reference
to svārājya in the jaiminīya account, there is a reference to ‘sāmrājya’
(JB 2.113.5 bṛhatī svargo lokaḥ sāmrājyaṃ), albeit sāmrājya in the
heavenly, other world. Although sāmrājya is not mentioned in the
pañcaviṃśa version, the taittiriya and kāthaka passages on the gosava
(both being śākhā-s belonging to the kṛṣṇa yajurveda) do refer to the
concept, with the latter being more explicit. TB 2.7.6.1.5 and kāth.B
37.6 designate the vājapeya as the ‘samrāṭsava’ that confers sāmrājya
upon the performer whereas the gosava rite confers svārājya. While the
taittiriya text equates prajāpati with svārājyam (TB 2.7.6.1.8), the
kāthaka equates prajāpati with sāmrājya (prajāpatis sāmrājyaṃ
parameṣṭhī) and then goes on to repeat the ‘svārājyam gaureva’ phrase
found in the taittiriya text, which we discussed in detail in part 1. It
was noted there that this equation of cattle and svārājya may offer an
insight into the transformation of the gosava rite, paving the way for
the incorporating the practice of imitating the unrestrained behaviour
of cattle, although the taittiriya brāhmaṇa itself does not instruct any
such imitative practice. Coming back to the jaiminīya text at hand,
Bhaṭṭa Bhāskara, in his commentary on taittiriya śruti, comments on
‘svārājyam gaureva’ as to how svārājya is verily the svatantra one
enjoys in brahmaloka. That comment is perhaps more apt for the jaiminīya
passage which speaks of sāmrājya in svarga loka. It is possible that the
jaiminīya account of gosava was influenced by the kṛṣṇa yajurvedin-s.

iv\. From the points numbered, i-iii, it would seem that the first part
of the jaiminīya text (2.113.1-15) was carefully constructed using
material from the existing gosava passages found in other brāhmaṇa texts
while modifying the traditional account as necessary. The rather
conspicuous omission of references to prajāpati (who could be as easily
equated with svarga as he is with svārājya) and the “substitute” measure
of the rather artificial insertion of bṛhatī metre personified as a
goddess jointly point towards the conclusion that the jaiminīya variant
of gosava was indeed the later one, deliberately differentiating itself
from its precursors.

v\. A reading of the second part (2.113.16-35), starting with “tasya
vratam”, seems to suggest that it was probably yet another, even later,
element deliberately grafted onto the first part. One notes the sudden,
total absence of ‘svarga’ and its related terms (svarga loka) as well as
derivatives and an unexpected and novel reference to ‘anaḍuha loka’ at
2.113.20 (anaḍuho ha lokaṃ jayati). From purely a textual criticism
perspective, it is irrelevant if anaḍuha loka is the svarga to be
attained for that would be a question for the vedabhāṣyakāra-s, the
brahmavādin-s.

vi\. It has to be noted that the execution of the rite by puṇyakeśa
yaudhena, the ruler of Śibi, is the only recorded instance of the
jaiminīya variant of gosava being performed, with the possible exception
of a narrative from the brahmāṇḍa purāṇa 2.36-64 involving dīrghatamas.
Furthermore, there is no explicit reference to the incest element in the
puṇyakeśa narrative or even any of the other acts (drinking water
directly from the source or cutting grass with one’s teeth without
hands) except excreting faeces. Towards the end of the jaiminīya text at
2.113.31-32, the qualification of the rite by puṇyakeśa stipulates that
only an elderly person can perform the rite and the very last line of
the text, 2.113.35 states that it is to be done in the final stage of
one’s life (uttaravayasye). This raises an interesting ambiguity. On one
hand, this qualification of gosava could be a way to circumvent the
deviant sexual element as some have understood it. For if the stated
acts were intended to constitute imitation of a bull, the performance by
a very old man would logically be the imitation of a bull of advanced
age that has lost its libido and virility and would not be able to
indulge in actual intercourse.

On the other hand, the actual text suggests contrarily, stating at
2.113.33 that all those aforementioned transgressive acts are allowed
for the elderly man (sthavirasya hy evedaṃ sarvam anujñātam), suggesting
that they were all to be performed in the literal sense and no exemption
was intended. However, looking at the wording of the contentious
injunction at 2.113.16, even if literal interpretation was employed, it
is possible that actual intercourse was probably never meant but merely
sexually approaching the woman (“upa mātaram iyād…”). Even approaching a
woman if she was a mother, sister or a sagotrā was deemed to be improper
as was eating grass from the ground or sipping water directly from the
source or excreting in any place without discretion. So, what is the
meaning of the statement that these acts were “allowed” (anujñātam) for
the old man? In my opinion, puṇyakeśa was probably making a reference to
senility and the indifference to norms an elderly man and lack of
control such a man may experience at an advanced age. Such acts may have
been considered justifiable in the context of senility. It has to be
mentioned that the only two other texts referring to these transgressive
acts (āpastamba śrautasūtra 22.13.1-3, hiraṇyakeśi śrautasūtra
17.5.25-26) do not mention this “old age” qualification at all.

A few salient points to note:

i\. Based on the taittiriya brāhmaṇa 2.7.6, the baudhāyana śrautasūtra
mentions the typical features such as the anointing of the sacrificer
with milk (pratidhugabhiṣecanāya), the ṣaṭtriṃśa stoma, the usage of
both saman-s (ubhayasāma), the use of the kaṇvarathaṃtara in the
pavamāna stotra and sitting on unraised ground (vederanuddhataṃ), but
also enjoins the use of gold and silver (suvarṇarajatau) sheets (rukmau
interpreted by C.G.Kashikar as sheets), the use of a pot filled with
parṇa (Kashikar translates this as Butea Frondosa leaves rather instead
of leaves although the term can mean both) into which the milk is later
poured. It also supplies the mantras to be used for the abhiṣecanīya
rite (anointing of the sacrificer with milk).



ii\. Both the apastamba and hiraṇyakeśi mention the transgressive
elements mentioned in the jaiminīya brāhmaṇa in addition to the usual
elements of the gosava rite. Interestingly, the normal elements of the
gosava are found in the 12^(th) kaṇḍikā while the transgressive ones are
all listed at the beginning of the 13^(th) kaṇḍikā before introducing
the marutstoma. My speculation is that these verses may have been
interpolated after the taittiriyakas of the apastambiya and hiraṇyakeśi
sectshad arrived in the south and interacted with the jaiminīyas, who,
by some accounts, seem to be the earliest brāhmaṇas to reach the south.



iii\. The rgveda śrautasūtra, the śāṅkhāyana and āśvalāyana put a
strange spin on it, stating that the gosava is performed by him who
desires cattle (paśu kāmo) although theśāṅkhāyana does mention a couple
of typical elements of the rite such as theṣaṭtriṃśa stoma and the
sacrificial fee (dakṣiṇā) of a myriad/ten thousand cows (ayutam). It
does raise the question in someone of little learning as myself as to
why someone who could afford to give away thousands of cows for the fee
would need to perform the gosava as he desires cattle.



iv\. The kātyāyana sūtra supplies an instance of a rather interesting
usage for the gosava rite where it is stated that some opine it being
akin to a vaiśyayajña and it is stated that a vaiśya or sthapati may
become the chieftain of a particular people/viś. One such possible
instance is provided by the ārya,
[here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/07/14/the-mysterious-confliction-between-bhrigu-s-and-gotama-s-according-to-the-tradition-of-the-urdhva-srotas/).
The term in kātyāyana, “sarājāno” was initially confusing but I found it
to be an irregular/alternative reading of “svarājānaḥ” from
lāṭyāyanaśrautasūtra 8.7.4, where it occurs in the context of
thebṛhaspatisava:yaṃ brāhmaṇāḥ svarājānaḥ puraskurvīran sa
bṛhaspatisavena yajeta. The precise meaning remains unclear but the
following rendition seems to be most probable: “Whoever may lead (yam
puraskurvīran, literally, to place infront, ātmanepada, optative, 3rd
person)brāhmaṇas ruling themselves (svarājānaḥ=sva+rājān), i.e.
leaderless, let him sacrifice (yajeta, 3rd person, optative) by \[means
of\] thebṛhaspatisava.” Similarly, thekātyāyana must be speaking of a
situation where a people/viś are without a chief and the person desiring
to lord over them is instructed to perform the gosava. Surely, a rite
that is capable of conferring thesvārājya ofprajāpati and parameṣṭhin
on one would be most apt to give legitimacy to the rulership of a
non-kṣatriya such as avaiśya or sthapati.
