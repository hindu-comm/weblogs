# Text as Text, Text as Deity: Reconciling Ritual Rules of Textual Traditions with Devotion to theGods

**Note:**Recently, I submitted an essay with the above title for a
biannual journal on polytheism,*Walking the Worlds*, for the Winter
issue of 2017, as you can see
[here.](https://walkingtheworlds.com/issues/)I am making the essay
available in this blog for interested readers from Twitter and
elsewhere. Hindu friends, do note that the journal is targeted at a
primarily Western audience, and hence I had to write a comprehensive
introduction. The essay can be read
[here](https://app.box.com/s/2n5p5vo7okaqq5ax2gx96b0be94uicfv):
