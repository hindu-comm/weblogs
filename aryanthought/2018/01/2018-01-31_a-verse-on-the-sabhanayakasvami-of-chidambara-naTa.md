# A verse on the sabhānāyakasvāmi of cidambara:naṭarāja

A couple of months ago, the following verses appeared in the cidākāśa of
my heart as I meditated on the deity of cidambaram. I had shared this
with a few earlier but thought of making it public.

தாமரை நாணச் செய்யும் செய்யத்திருமகள் நாணச் செய்யும்

தாமரைக்கண்னோவ நச்சுயிர்க்கும் சிரமாயிரத்தான் பழிவீழ

தாமரைமகனார்க்கு நான்மறை ஈத்த ஐந்தலை முதல்வன்

தாமரையில் கூத்தாடி கண்ணுக்கு மருந்தானானே

saṃskṛta and ISO transliterations for anyone who does not read tamiḻ but
yet desires to read this modest attempt at poetry:

तामरै नाणच् चॆय्युम् चॆय्यत्तिरुमगळ् नाणच् चॆय्युम्

तामरैक्कण्ऩोव नच्चुयिर्क्कुम् सिरमायिरत्ताऩ् पऴिवीऴ

तामरैमगऩार्क्कु नाऩ्मऱै ईत्त ऐन्तलै मुदल्वऩ्

तामरैयिल् कूत्ताडि कण्णुक्कु मरुन्दाऩाऩे

tāmarai nāṇac ceyyum ceyyattirumagaḷ nāṇac ceyyum

tāmaraikkaṇṉōva naccuyirkkum siramāyirattāṉ paḻivīḻa

tāmaraimagaṉārkku nāṉmaṟai ītta aintalai mudalvaṉ

tāmaraiyil kūttāḍi kaṇṇukku marundāṉāṉē

Meaning:To remove the blame of the thousand-headed one (ādiśeṣa)
breathing the toxic \[breaths\] that have pained the lotus-like eye of
viṣṇu that makes the red\[-complexioned\] lakṣmī shy, who makes the
lotus shy; \[to remove that blame\] the five-headed chief (sadāśiva) who
gave the four veda-s to the lotus-born son (brahma); he (sadāśiva)
danced in the lotus and became a medicine to that eye \[of viṣṇu\]!

Notes:

1\. The word, ‘செய்ய’ in ‘செய்யத்திருமகள்’ (चॆय्य inचॆय्यत्तिरुमगळ् or
ceyyainceyyattirumagaḷ) means red in this context. Interested readers
can see an example of such an usage in song no. 255 of ainkurunūru
here:https://sangamtranslationsbyvaidehi.com/ettuthokai-ainkurunuru/ as
well as in song no. 323 of aganānūru
here:https://sangamtranslationsbyvaidehi.com/ettuthokai-akananuru-301-400/

2\. The shyness of lakṣmī can be understood in two, distinct ways:

a\. When she saw the lotus eye of hari looking at her, she became
overcome with bashfulness.

b\. She saw the lotus eye and felt shy due to the beauty of his two eyes
easily rivaling that of her entire form.

In either case, the shyness oflakṣmī results in her acquiring a reddish
complexion so beautiful that it embarrasses the lotus, causing the lotus
to feel shy.

3\. The reference to śiva(sadāśiva is the special name given
tośiva;sadāśiva is the highest deity of thesiddhānta system) giving
the four veda-s to brahma is a reference tośvetāśvatara upaniṣat 6.18.
In thisupaniṣat, it is quite clear that brahman is identified
asśiva-rudra.

yo brahmāṇaṃ vidadhāti pūrvaṃ yo vai vedāṃś ca prahiṇoti tasmai…

4\. Finally, the last lotus is a reference to both the temple of
cidambaram, where sadāśiva performs the peerless dance as well as the
lotus of the heart referred to in the daharavidyā chapter of
cāndogyopaniṣat. In that lotus of the heart is a small space called the
cidākāśa. cidākāśa is, thus, the space in the lotus of the heart, where
the self is visualized as dwelling; the self (ātman) which is the very
embodiment of consciousness (cit). Both cidākāśa and cidambara are
semantically the same.

atha yad idam asmin brahmapure **daharaṃ** **puṇḍarīkaṃ** veśma daharo
‘sminn **antarākāsaḥ** \|  
tasmin yad antas tad anveṣṭavyaṃ tad vāva vijijñāsitavyam iti \|\|
cāndogyopaniṣat 8.1.1 \|\|

5\. Something I learnt only after I composed this verse: The cidambara
mahātmya composed byumāpati śivācārya (a famous śaiva teacher who was
one of the priests at the great temple of cidambaram) in its fifteenth
chapter has a narrative ofśiva explaining toādiśeṣa how he performs
the dance at cidambaram, which is to earth what the heart is to the
body! (A direct reference to thedaharavidyā explained in point 3
above). In hindsight, this modest composition of mine becomes elevated
to a meaningful and divine coincidence.
