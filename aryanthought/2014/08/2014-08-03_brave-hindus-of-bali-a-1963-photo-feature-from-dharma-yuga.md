# Brave Hindus of Bali, a 1963 Photo Feature from DharmaYuga

Had to re-blog this! If only the Hindus of Bharata could have a quarter
of this fervour and devotion, the fire of the Dharma would shine a
thousand times brighter! May Rudra-MahAkAla aid us in crushing the Dasyu
rAjas, those bloody rAkshasAs in Deva-Vesha, the PretamArgin-s and
Mohamatta-margin-s.
