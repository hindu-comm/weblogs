Keezhadi: An ancient site of Vedic Tamil Pāṇḍyan kingdom

# 

**NOTE: This post is an updated version of my original post on Keezhadi written at Indiafacts.org (**[**https://indiafacts.org/keezhadi-does-it-reflect-a-non-vedic-dravidian-civilization-in-ancient-tamil-nadu/**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220209133904/https://indiafacts.org/keezhadi-does-it-reflect-a-non-vedic-dravidian-civilization-in-ancient-tamil-nadu/)**). I do not own any of the pictures used in this post, all credits goes to the original sources which I’ve mentioned under the images.**

The ancient archeological site at Keezhadi from Tamil Nadu is known for it’s latest discoveries on the antiquity of the site, early usage Brahmi script and graffiti symbols which supposedly has links to the script of the earlier Indus valley or Harappan civilization. Many reports have gone as far to state that the urban civilization in ancient Tamil Nadu started at the same time as in Ganga regions of northern India, around 6th century BCE. They also state that the pre-Vedic Dravidian people of Indus valley civilization migrated southwards and settled in ancient Tamil lands or Tamilakam to give rise to another civilization which was free from the Vedic influences developed in north, and that Keezhadi finds reflects this pre-Vedic ‘secular’ Tamil civilization. Excavations at Keezhadi is thus a popular topic for Dravidianists to highlight the antiquity of unique Dravidian culture which was free from Vedic Hindu influence from north.. How true are these claims? This write up does an analysis of such claims with factual sources.

**Usage of early Tamil Brahmi script**

First let’s go through the issue regarding Tamil Brahmi script. What is Tamil Brahmi? One of the veteran epigraphist who spent his lifetime on Tamil inscriptions, late Iravatham Mahadevan, states that Tamil Brahmi was regional script adapted from original Brahmi to suit the needs of Tamil \[1\]

“*The early Tamil cave inscriptions are written in a special regional and linguistic variant of the Brahmi script adapted to the needs of Tamil phonetics. This script, now generally referred to as Tamil-Brahmi, is most probably the one named Damili in the Jaina canonical works Samavayanga Sutta and Pannavana Sutta (assigned to the Pre-Christian Era), and as Dravidalipi in the Buddhist work Lalitavistara (probably written in the early centuries A.D.).* “

Mahadevan viewed earlier script of Indus valley civilization as representing Dravidian language, but even he had to admit that Tamil Brahmi is but a modified version of original Brahmi which was used in other parts of the Indian subcontinent. It only means Brahmi script was originally used to write dialects of Prakrit language, which were evolved from Old Vedic Sanskrit or it’s related dialects, which was also the popular language from regions of Afghanistan in north to Deccan in south during the early historic period.

The fact that Prakrit was the original language of Brahmi is further supported by occurrence of many Prakrit inscriptions from early Sangam age Tamilakam. It could only point towards northern origins of Brahmi from Prakrit speaking areas. Archeologist K. Rajan in his book has written the following \[2\].

*“There are several names of north Indian origin, which are in Prakrit proper. A few are in hybrid form too. The Prakrit names can be recognized by the occurrence of non-Tamil graphemes (aspirants. soft letters, and sibilants) and the genitive case endings like śa, sa, ha. ya. There are several names in pure Tamil like campaṉ , vaḷikaṉ , kannaṉ , antavaṉ n, cuḷantai, māttaṉ , pākaṉ, in Prakrit like nikama, and in Tamilized Pralkrit like kuviraṉ , silikaṉ and makatai. There are certain names like ātaṉ-asaṭaṉ and periyaṉ -sātaṉ , in which, one segment is in Tamil and another segment is in Prakrit or in Tamilized Prakrit. Another interesting feature is that certain names are written differently. For instance, the Prakrit names sāta and tisa are Tamilized by adding alveolar ṉ at the end making the word as sātaṉ and tissaṉ respectively. In another instance. the initial sa in the word sātaṉ is converted into Tamil ca. Likewise, the name tisa is written as tīssaṉ/tissaṉ as well as tissan (the alveolar ending ṉ is replaced with dental n).The writing in both ways like cātaṉ or sātaṉ, clearly suggests that the residents of Kodumanal were familiar with both the languages.* ”

In fact multiple sites dating back to early Sangam age in Tamil Nadu has yielded inscribed Prakrit words. As per K. Rajan, the Prakrit words occurs from earliest layers in Tamil Nadu, going back to 6th century BCE \[3\]

*“Thus, the influence of Prakrit-speaking at lexical and structural levels needs to be studied very closely. However, there is not much room for such structural analysis in Kodumanal inscribed potsherds as 99% of them are very short and mostly carry personal names. We hardly get any evidence of Prakritized Tamil, probably unwarranted in Tamil speaking area. The occurrence of Prakrit names from the lowermost layers of the habitation cuttings suggest that the adaptation process might have taken place well before 6th century BCE. “*

Also, supposedly one of the earliest discovered Tamil Brahmi inscription from Tamil Nadu reads as ‘vayra’ which itself is a loan from Sanskrit or Prakrit *vajra*. So this proves that Tamil Brahmi had Prakrit loans since earliest period \[4\]

Another thing is that as per the excavation reports, the early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions from Keezhadi itself shows Tamilized loans from Prakrit or Sanskrit such as the name Kuviraṉ. It is ultimately from Sanskrit name Kuvera or Kubera, who is the ruler of Yakṣa-s or nature spirits. \[5\]

From all these evidences, we can say that early Prakrit loans into Tamil inscriptions from earliest periods shows a crystal clear link with north, and probably that Prakrit loans came from north to south along with the Brahmi script. So in nutshell, the discovery of early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions only pushes back the antiquity of the original northern Brahmi as well.

**The link between Indus script symbols and graffities discovered from southern sites.**

Now we move on the Graffiti-Indus link. The finds of Indus script-like graffities from Tamil Nadu is nothing new. Over the years, there have been various reports of these Indus script-like finds. However none of them have been verified properly because the graffiti signs occur here and there, that too mostly in isolated cases without any proper sequence like we see in a proper writing system. These signs do occur along with Brahmi letters sometimes, but probably these were trademarks or other sort of marks representing locality, industry, clan or tribe etc. To claim that it represents a developed writing system like Indus script is too much, as we don’t have any proper inscriptions in such graffities apart from isolated occurrences. In fact such Indus-like graffiti symbols also occurs in iron age cultures of north India. For example a seal from the ancient city of Vaishali in Bihar supposedly has Indus script-like symbols

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nKXWvQVEMS9xiEnuiZ4Nob-ZTgZTR9271BTWDRu8jyLgf9FhnynCD2mGlB7vfdzCnazvkR-BG5TrCWF2msCng4cPM_8XY9PNIDPcPj8A25wMcaqaeWEv18yyUg_3fGWZwu4TPJKr-NYiKVjB86luTg)

The seal from ancient city of Vaishali with graffiti symbols resembling Indus script. Source *Vaisali excavations, 1958-1962,* by B. P. Sinha, and Sita Ram Roy.

This seal is dated much later than Indus valley civilization. It was commented upon even by Iravatham Mahadevan, who usually endorsed Dravidian authorship of Indus valley civilization, as representing Indus script-like signs \[6\].

*“Had \[the seal\] been found at Harappa, it would not have attracted special attention”*

We do not know the exact significance of such symbols. It is true that some symbols does have resemblance to the Indus signs, and even if such graffiti symbols found from southern India indeed derive from Indus script, it doesn’t mean that Indus language was Dravidian. After all the seal from Vaishali is obviously from the era when the region was part of Vedic culture (archeologists dated it to Mauryan era at the earliest, while Mahadevan comments that it is at least from 1100 BCE). Hence, we can also view that such graffiti symbols came from north to south via historical expansion of the Vedic culture into southern India which had it’s origins from Harappan regions, if we identify Harappan
civilization as Vedic or even ancestral to the Vedic culture! Thus the assumption that the Indus-like symbols discovered from southern India indicates a Dravidian migration from Indus valley to southern India is entirely based on the preconceived notion that Indus valley civilization was Dravidian, which is yet to be proven.

**A non-Vedic civilization in early Tamilakam?**

Since the Keezhadi finds, the Dravidianists have been claiming that Keezhadi represents an independent pre-Vedic secular Tamil civilization which was free of Vedic influences from north.

But on contrary, from the Prakrit loans highlighted previously, it is clear that Keezhadi, like other ancient sites of Tamilakam, had links with northern India since it’s earliest period and they were not part of any isolated separate pre-Vedic Dravidian civilization.

True, the findings from Keezhadi would push back the date of urbanism in Tamilakam back to 6th century BCE. But to say that it was contemporary to Ganga urbanization is not entirely correct.

By 600 BCE many urban Vedic Janapadas with grand cities were already established in Ganga region as well as in Deccan. These Janapadas also minted their own punch-marked coins. In fact we also find early Tamil Pāṇḍyan kingdom minting the same type of coins with their royal fish symbol on reverse.

Based on this, late R Krishnamurthy, one of the greatest Tamil numismatist and epigraphist , comments that the Pāṇḍyan kingdom could have existed as a Janapada as early as 5th century BCE.

This only means that proper kingdoms & currency system was established in southern India during the time of Vedic Janapadas with the influences and contacts from north.

It is to be noted that the ancient Pāṇḍyan capital city Madurai is close to Keezhadi. In fact potsherds of Keezhadi also shows graffiti with fishes, which was the royal symbol of Pāṇḍyans. This suggests that the site had close affinity with Pāṇḍyans.

In earliest recorded Tamil literature, i.e. the Sangam literature, the ancient Pāṇḍyan kings are said to have been followers of Vedic religion and performed Vedic rituals. In fact according to a Sangam age poem from Puranānūru which is part of earliest Sangam literature , a Pāṇḍyan king named Palyākasālai Mutukuṭumi Peruvaḻuti is said to have been a devotee of Shiva and only bowed his head before Brahmin sages to gain their blessings. He held the title ‘Palyāgasalai’ since he performed numerous Vedic sacrifices.

“*May your umbrella of victory bow down and circumambulate, in the auspicious direction, the temple of the god with three eyes whom the Brahmins worship!*

*Greatness! Lower your head with respect before the hands raised in blessing by those Brahmins who chant the Four Vedas! My king!*

*May your chaplet wither, assaulted by the sweet-smelling smoke of flames rising from the lands of your enemies!* “

-Puranānūru poem 6 translated by George L Hart \[8\]

Apart from this, Sangam age Pāṇḍyans also issued coins depicting a horse tied to yūpa or Vedic sacrificial post and a fire altar nearby. As per R Krishnamurthy, this coin is considered to have been minted during performance of Vedic Ashvamedha sacrifice by the early Pāṇḍyan kings. \[9\]

Further, a copper coin of Pāṇḍyans with image of a horse has been found from Keezhadi itself.\[10\]

Thus, the ancient Tamil kingdoms followed Vedic traditions and were part of one unified civilization which included northern Vedic Janapadas as well. The early Tamil kingdoms & ancient sites like Keezhadi were not part of any separate pre-Vedic civilization like Dravidianists wants them to be.

**Early Urbanism in Northern and Southern India.**

It is plain wrong to state that urbanism in Tamilakam occurred same time as in Ganga region. Urbanism in Ganga region dates back to ‘proto-urban’ Pianted Grey Ware or PGW cultural phase, beyond 1000 BCE and well beyond 6th century BCE dates from Keezhadi.

Even the 6th century BCE date for urbanism at Keezhadi is from findings of Brick structures as the report says \[11\]

*“It is generally believed that the Early Historic phase of Tamil Nadu began with 3rd century BCE and the second urbanization did not occur in Tamil Nadu. In contrast to this, the occurrence of large scale brick structures and associated artefacts of high economic value unearthed at Keeladi suggest that the second urbanization too happened in Tamil Nadu around 6th century BCE as happened in Gangetic plains.* “

But if we go by this, then bricks were widely used for construction even in northern Indian sites associated with iron age Painted Grey Ware (PGW) culture dated no later than 1000 BCE, which is centuries earlier than Keezhadi finds. Veteran archeologist BB Lal had written on this decades back \[12\] \[13\]

“*The third kind of constructional material encountered at Bhagwanpura relates to kilnburnt bricks. It is said that owing to the subsequent ploughing away of the site, no clear-cut structures were identified, but bricks of the following sizes were met with: 20 × 20 × 8 cm; 12 × 12 × 8 cm; 20 × 30 × 8 cm; 16 × 12 × 4 cm; and 29 × 22–12.5 × 7 cm.17 The first two sizes represent clear squares, while the last one is wedge-shaped. It is known that bricks used in walls are generally rectangular not square. On this basis, it would appear that the square bricks had been used in some other kind of construction – maybe a squarish ritualistic altar or some similar structure. The wedge-shaped bricks may have been used in a circular structure. Evidence of burnt bricks also comes from Dadheri where the sizes are 12 × 12 × 7 cm and 25 × 20 × 5 cm.18 Use of burnt bricks is also attested at Hastinapura*…”

” *As a result, there is a good evidence to say that the beginning of the Painted Grey Ware at the iron-using sites such as Noh and Atranjikhera and derivatively at Hastinapura and Mathura too, is in no case later than 1000 b.c. It may well be much earlier. The Painted Grey Ware levels in the iron-using sites of the upper Ganges-Jamuna basin may broadly be dated between the limits of 1100 and 700 b.c. and the Painted Grey Ware/ Northern Black Polished Ware overlap between 700 and 500 b.c. The pre-Iron phase of this culture which has yet to be firmly established may well antedate 1100 b.c*“

Much more developments were made in the study of PGW since BB Lal wrote this, and the dating of PGW sites can now go back to mid 2nd millennium BCE at least. Further even in his old writings BB Lal notes that some PGW sites also overlaps with late Harappan culture. \[14\]

“*The burials at Bhagwanpura may be of either Harappan or of Painted Grey Ware people, because it was a period of overlap*“

In fact Keezhadi is just one site showing early signs of urbanism in Tamilakam, while most other ancient sites in ancient Tamilakam were overwhelmingly in non-urban megalithic phase during the iron age until urbanism kicked in during later centuries. In the Ganga zone we have signs of urbanism or proto-urbanism from multiple sites which later evolved into grand cities. The urbanization of Ganga region was a gradual process, tracing the roots to iron age PGW culture which itself overlapped with late Harappan culture. It is certainly older than any urban site from Tamilakam discovered so far. So it is not correct to claim that process of urbanism in early Tamilakam was contemporary with that of north, nor does it have any links with Harappan culture like the media hype or Dravidianist claims.

**Vedic civilization unified north & south India**

Finally, I quote the words of one of the greatest south Indian historian KAN Sastri. According to him the Vedic ‘Aryanization’ process of southern India gradually started with early phase from around 1000 BCE onwards \[15\]

“*The Aryanization of the South was no doubt a slow process spread over several centuries. Beginning probably about 1000 BC, it had reached its completion before the time of Katyayana, the grammarian of the fourth century BC, who mentions the names of the Tamil countries of the extreme South.* “

During 1000 BCE most parts of Tamilakam were in neolithic or megalithic phase. While we have no clue about the language or religion of these iron age megalithic people, from their association with punch-marked coins & prevalence of megalithic culture even into later centuries (by then Tamil kingdoms already followed Vedic culture), we can probably infer that it could indeed have been associated with expansion of Vedic culture from north. The proper urban civilization in Tamilakam gradually evolved by later centuries BCE & it didn’t form any separate civilization from north. Once the expansion of Vedic culture into south happened, both north & south India had one unified Vedic civilization since earliest attested historic era.

All likely the Vedic cultural expansions from out of the Vedic regions of northern India during late Vedic era onwards also included movement of people as well. Hence, vast majority of the modern speakers of Dravidian linguistic groups, including the Tamils, also share the heritage & ancestry of ancient Vedic civilization even if they don’t acknowledge this fact as a historical reality.
