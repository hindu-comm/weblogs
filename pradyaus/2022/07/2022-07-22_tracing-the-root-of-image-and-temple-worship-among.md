Tracing the roots of Image and Temple worship among Hindus

Image and temple worship (Mūrti Pūjā and Kṣetropāsana) forms an integral part of Hinduism today. This write up is an attempt to trace the roots of Mūrti Pūjā and Kṣetropāsana.

The earliest definite evidence of the images of divinities are from the mature phase of Harappan or Sarasvatī-Sindhū civilization era (2600-1900 BCE). Although there are no definite buildings pointing towards religious affinities, a structure from Mundigak site has been interpreted as a ‘temple’ by archeologists. The exact significance of this structure remains unknown. There are also reports of certain fire altars used for religious purposes from various Harappan sites, but we are not going to detail that in this post since this post is mostly about Mūrti Pūjā.

Various representations of Harappan divinities can be seen in the seals. For instance the famous ‘Proto-Śiva’ or ‘Paśupati’ seal depicts a horned divinity seated in a Yogic posture. Various such Yogic seals have been found from Harappan civilization.

It is interesting to note that this same Yogic posture is also encountered in depictions of Hindu deities from the early historic period, despite the huge time gap. For instance coins from Ujjain region depict Lord Śiva seated in the exact same Yogic posture.

Another such iconographic continuity from Harappan times is reflected in *prabhavali* or the divine aura represented by an arch surrounding the deity, which is popular in Hindu art. *Prabhavali* iconography can be noticed in Harappan seals, and continued into the historic period. In Harappan seals, the arch is that of a pipal tree. Pipal tree is the holiest of all trees among Hindus even today. Such depictions of divinities under *prabhavali* or divine aura can be seen on early punch-marked coins from Kosala kingdom and Pañcāla kingdom, long after the disappearance of Harappan civilization.

There are also various other depictions of Harappan horned deity such as in the famous ‘Divine Adoration’ seal which depicts the horned deity being worshiped by a ritualist along with a ram and 7 other human figures below.

Curiously, divinities with Harappan horned iconography are also depicted in coins from Śuṅga era, which over two thousand years after disappearance of Harappan tradition.

We do not know of the identity of this horned divinity, and it is still an enduring mystery for the students of ancient Indian history. Early excavators cited the Yogic divinity may represent the Paśupati aspect of God Śiva, the Lord of Animals. But this is based on mere speculations.

Apart from seals, there are also various terracotta female figurines dubbed as ‘Mother Goddess’ discovered from various Harappan civilization sites. But we cannot confirm if they indeed depict Goddesses or any random women.

It is however interesting to note that many *Śiva Liṅga* type objects are found from Harappan sites. However, these are not that common and can also be any random phallic object. Phallic cult is found in various ancient cultures, not just Hinduism. Another thing is that these *Liṅga* type objects vary from the actual *Liṅgas* found from early historic period, most of which are *Mukha-Liṅgas* having faces of Śiva (which will be shown below).

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8iMFuJeyLYrLv7fbQdcBa7M5H2uYgDvfZmLHcgPJhWJx7L75LsYKalk9OuuZLdcMmW3a64VuzaiDE3vH5GHake-S2FwW--Ub8IiWmevF6Qjn7vYoHeInwm4bM7Pij8-Uu2pBG-koMhQiEhw1BpDSdA)

We have no way to determine the names of the Harappan divinities unless we properly decipher the Indus script. They may or may have not been Vedic deities. All that remains is mere speculations and guessworks.

However, what is interesting is that the Yogic depiction along the *Prabhavali* iconography had survived into the historical period. They clearly have Harappan origin.

Now let us move on to the Vedic texts. Hindu Temples and Mūrti worship are mostly maintained according to Āgama-Tantric or other associated texts varying on traditions. But during the Vedic age there was little emphasis on image worship. Many authors are of the opinion that image worship was thus alien to Vedic Aryans. Some go as far as claiming image and temple worship originates from non-Vedic traditions or with Greek contacts.

However, we cannot completely rule out the existence of image worship during Vedic age just because they don’t find mention in Vedic literature itself, which mostly describe Vedic sacrificial tradition based on fire rituals or Yajña. Some Vedic ritual texts do hint at the existence of image worship during Vedic age.

For instance Śatapatha Brāhmana, a Vedic ritual text associated with Yajur Veda clearly mentions making a golden image of the supreme creator deity Puruṣa-Prajāpati and worshiping it as part of the Vedic Agnicayana ritual.

*He (the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him with the Sarpanāma (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these worlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever there is; and Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods. They, the gods, having laid down (on the altar) that self of theirs, were afraid lest these worlds should glide away with that self of theirs.* – Śatapatha Brāhmana 7.4.1.25 translated by Julius Eggeling \[1\]

The image is to be deposited in the ground as the foundation of the large fire altar used in the ritual. During the performance of Agnicayana in my state of Kerala in southern India, the native Nambūdiri Brahmins who preserved the ancient Vedic ritualism had made the Golden image of Puruṣa-Prajāpati as documented by Indologist Frits Staal in 1975.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EabrQlEtTGjW2LmhKDlKn7Z-Ll9JfPBFxnO7MqI8_Eb3uYimvEmBHiEqIObQ68U3Ke1_GbIZwU5EUIwEWJnWNLJVz2url0OEC7YxsUGaJJnHmrS2AjWviORGAcQhJu_iycBblxfqYzIfJCAxBoW1Nw)

Thus, the making of Golden image hints that theVedic people were familiar with making images of divinities.

Further, later Vedic Gṛhya ritual texts likes Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra as well as Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra also makes mentions of images and ‘homes’ of Gods as well.

*(If going in his chariot) toward (images of) Gods, let him descend (from the chariot) before he has reached them; if toward Brāhmanas, just before (reaching them); if toward cows, when amid them; if toward fathers, when he has reached them.*

– Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra 3.14.8 translated by Hermann Oldenberg\[2\]

*(And says) ‘Leaving off for three days the putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and the obedience to the teacher, fast in the forest, in a God’s house or in a place where Agnihotra is performed, keeping silence, with earnest care.’*

– Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra 2.12.6 translated by Hermann Oldenberg

*Gods’-houses (he shall walk round) keeping the right side turned to them.*

– Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra 4.12.15 translated by Hermann Oldenberg \[2\]

Apart from this, there are also mentions of *Caityas* in certain passages of Gr̥hya Suūtra-s.

*At a Caitya sacrifice he should before the Svishtakrit (offering) offer a Bali to the Caitya.* *If, however, (the Caitya) is distant, (he should send his Bali) through a leaf-messenger.* –

Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra 1.12.1-2 translated by Hermann Oldenberg \[2\]

The word *Caitya* derives from Sanskrit term *Citi*, meaning piled up brick fire altar. In early historic art we also see simple brick shrines which could have worshiped by the public.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rvwutbU8-FhDeL01DGkzUdkc1qXB3foP19taavl46kaonshRgL2JlaNy3a8gxxDe4qpmoq-PF8DJIkJnEtX9BnZ9bZ2y7isF6OniZ_Nz4dJGGc0anlnT5XtEd7SF3gykw0cfEJLHFxhUD7UHMrn2lQ)

It is likely that early temples evolved from such humble shrines, which later transformed into grand temples.

Thus, it is tempting to assume that early *Caitya-s* directly evolved out of Vedic piling of brick altars.

Later, Buddhists and Jain texts also called their shrines as *Caitya-s*. For instance Buddhist text Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta belonging to the early Pali Canon mentions various *Caitya* shrines as *Cetiya* \[3\].

It is also worth mentioning that Achaemenid Persian king Xerxes in his Daiva inscription boasts of destroying Daivadāna or temples of Daivas or Daevas, the Iranian counterpart of Hindu Devas who were demonized \[4\] .We do not know if these temples refer to the ones in Indian lands conquered by the Achaemenids or remnants of Daeva worshipers in Iranian lands who survived the Zoroastrian assault.

Apart from this, Vedic grammarian Pāṇini who lived close to the Achaemenid era clearly mentions image worship. He specifically mentions about the Mūrtis to which Pūjā is offered (Pūjārtha) . It is also to be noted that Patañjali commenting upon Pāṇini also mentions that images of divinities made of gold used during Mauryan era \[5\].

Arthaśāstra of Kautilya, also belonging to the same era mentions building temples for various divinites such as Śiva, Kubera, Aśvini Kumāra-s, Śrī-Lakṣmī etc.

17 *In the middle of the city, he should have these built: shrines for Aparājita, Apratihata, Jayanta, and Vaijayanta, and abodes for Śiva, Vaiśravaṇa, Aśvins, Śrī, and Madirā* .

18 *He should install deities of the* building sites according to the location.

19 *The presiding deities of the gates are Brahmā , Indra, Yama, and Senāpati.*

20 *Outside at a distance of 100 Dhanuṣes from the moat should be built sanctuaries, holy places, groves, and reservoirs, as also in each quarter its respective deity,\* or in the north-northeast.*

– Arthaśāstra 2.4.17-20 translated by Patrick Olivelle \[6\]

From all these, it is clear that image worship existed during the pre-Mauryan era and was popular in Mauryan era. Further, Archaeologist SP Gupta had dated the earliest remains of the famous Vidisha Vāsudeva temple at Basnagar as early as 5th century BCE \[7\]. Nearby this temple stands the famous Heliodorus pillar, which is a testimony of the conversion of Heliodorus, the Greek ambassador to the Śuṅga court, into Bhāgavata Vaiṣṇavism.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JDE9HolV4av1sCyCuUfqElq_fkyqlpXztoHaAsxIZNGr-ZqIqsdntQ1op2ERDPeiVQ1t_h1hDOjSW2bPKKKMmSuXIsB3n8ElYFalQ--NR1FSXhNBhXY4-gQfHuaOSB3JlN-JmMgABKcL4so4u88Rw)

Various early temples are also depicted in coinage of Śuṅga era, from 2nd century BCE onwards. For instance, coins of Audumbara tribe from Punjab region depicts Śiva temples along with the Trident-Axe symbol, which is weapon of Śiva.

Now, if we move on to southern India, we also find mention of temples in early Sangam age Tamil poems. For instance Sangam age Tamil poem from Puranānūru mentions temple of three eyed God i.e. Śiva.

*May your umbrella of victory bow down and circumambulate, in the auspicious direction, the temple of the god with three eyes whom the Brahmins worship!*

*Greatness! Lower your head with respect before the hands raised in blessing by those Brahmins who chant the Four Vedas! My king!*

*May your chaplet wither, assaulted by the sweet-smelling smoke of flames rising from the lands of your enemies!*

-Puranānūru poem 6 translated by George L Hart \[8\]

A recently discovered Sangam age Tamil Pāṇḍyan coin also shows a building, which is probably a Śiva temple as a bull is seen nearby, which is his mount.

From all these details , it is clear that temple and image worship was popular in BCE period.

Now let us take a look at earliest depictions of popular Hindu deities such as Viṣṇu, Śiva, forms of Devī, Skanda, Gaṇeśa, Sūrya , Hanumān etc .

**Agni**

Images of Agni riding on his ram mount is found from Bengal dated around 1st century BCE or CE. Another early image of Agni is found from Mathura, the so called Agnipāṇi Yaksha image, which is associated with Agni. This is also dated to 1st century BCE.

**Indra**

Early images of Indra are found in early Buddhist art. One of the earliest such images is from Sanchi Stūpa gateway, dated to 1st century BCE, as part of a panel narrating Buddhist Jātaka. Here Indra appears as holding his weapon, Vajra or stylized thunderbolt.

**Sūrya**

Images of Sūrya riding on his chariot are found in various contexts, such as in Bhaja caves, Kukkuta dhvaja, Bodhgaya, Udayagiri (Orissa), Chandraketugarh. The image of royal procession as depicted in Kulu vase can also be a depiction of Sūrya . In these early images, Sūrya is also accompanied by two female figures named Uṣā and Pratyuṣā i.e. personifications of Dawn and Dusk .

**Gaṇeśa**

There is depiction of elephant-faced human seated on a throne in one of the Greco-Bactrian coin, which could possibly be an early representation of Gaṇeśa. Archaeologist MK Dhavalikar has written briefly about it in his monograph \[11\]. He has also written that elephant deity was the patron deity of Kapisha (modern Begram) region in Afghanistan. Further similar elephant headed figures are also depicted in terracotta art of Bengal, dating to Śuṅga period. Hence there’s no harm in assuming that proto-forms of Gaṇeśa already existed in BCE period. Gaṇeśa images became more popular from early CE and found from sites like Mathura.

Images are plenty of Skanda from start of common era. He is depicted with the Mātṝkā figures in many panels from Mathura. His manifestations named Śākha-Viśākha and Naigameśa are also encountered in Kuṣāṇa coins dated to early CE. Skanda was also known as Mahāsena in Kuṣāṇa period.

**Hanumān**

We do not have any early depictions of Hanumān that pre-dating Gupta era. From Gupta era onwards there are various depictions of Hanumān.

Apart from above mentioned major Hindu deities, the combined forms of deities such as Ardhanārīśvara and Hari-Hara are also attested from the Kuṣāṇa period onwards.

It is clear from above details that all of the earliest depictions of these popular Hindu deities are found from ‘Aryan’ context as the regions where most of these images were found was already under the so called ‘Aryan’ Brahmanical Hindu culture. Hence, most of the major Hindu deities like Śiva, Viṣṇu, Devī, Skanda, Gaṇeśa etc are clearly of ‘Aryan’ origin and none of them were non-Aryan deities appropriated into Brahmanical fold as stated by many. Further, we do not have any records of ‘pre-Aryan’ past of these deities either.

We do not however deny the possibility that the local deities became linked with major Hindu deities and legends when Hinduism gained more influence throughout the centuries. Local legends surrounding the major deities also developed in many regions. For instance Hari-Hara Putra Dharma Śāsta or Ayyanār is deity unique to southern India, mostly popular in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In north, he has parallels in Revanta, Son of Sūrya . Both Ayyanār-Śāsta and Revanta are closely associated with horses, and Kerala Tantric texts explicitly connects Ayyanār-Śāsta with Revanta \[12\]. The worship of these Gods became more popular in medieval era, but both Ayyanār-Śāsta, who is regarded as Son of Śiva and Viṣṇu one one hand, and Revanta, who is regarded as Son of Sūrya on the other, are clearly connected with the major Hindu pantheon of Gods. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/82fJM5inKWII1Sz45LHgxhX2XkTmZ-jBdOfl76YEbEmFzZVPngcN_4Ycg2YJcV2ORep88IuN_vGd02m_eqgzt17JOhTnSdjXY0x6-bzniHNi91PipdQ8oMa2IbXFNxMtFfRX3lmixW3CzgOjF4Fvv8Y)Pallava era image of Ayyanār from Villupuram, Tamil Nadu.

Thus it is clear that there was continuous evolution of deities in Hinduism connecting with the major pantheon.

From all the above documented evidences it is clear that the image and temple worship was already in practice during mid 1st millennium BCE, during the period of second urbanization which led to Ganga region emerging as stronghold of Indian civilization, as the testimony of Gṛhya Sūtra-s and Pāṇini shows. It further ripened by final centuries BCE, the Mauryan-Śuṅga era. It is also clear from numismatic evidence that various types of temples were built by start of Common Era.

Hence, the popular notion that the temple worship only began during the Gupta era or with Greek or Buddhist influence must be reconsidered.
Since late Vedic Gṛhya Sūtra-s and grammarian Pāṇini who lived in 5-4th century BCE knows of image worship in mid 1st millennium BCE, it pushes the origins of image and temple worship further back into antiquity.

It is clear that popular Hindu image worship has it’s Vedic antecedents, as image of Puruṣa-Prajāpati is made and worshiped as part of Vedic Agnicayana rite. Thus, image worship is not any ‘non-Aryan’ appropriation into Vedic Brahmanical fold.
