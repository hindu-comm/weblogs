The Aryan expansion from the steppes into India: An analysis based on ancient populations

The bronze age Sintashta culture of the steppes near the Ural mountains is considered by majority of the Indo-Europeanists as the home of Indo-Iranians or the ‘Aryans’ who were common ancestors of Indic and Iranian speakers before they moved into India and Iran as per the steppe kurgan hypothesis.

This culture is dated from around 2400 BCE as per the earliest estimations. An average Sintashta settlement hosted around 200-700 people as per archaeologist Alicia Ventresca Miller who works on ancient populations of Eurasian Steppes \[1\].

*“Middle Bronze Age (2400–1800 cal BCE) people, often referred to as the Sintashta, constructed nucleated settlements, with population estimates ranging from 200 to 700 individuals.”*

Many Sintashta settlements only had a few hundred people on average as per the study by anthropologist Denis Sharapov, at max it reached around \~1000 \[2\].

*“ Existing population estimates of people living within the fortified walls of Sintashta towns are often based on the counts of the housing structures, the outlines of which have been detected through the stereoscopic analysis of Soviet-era aerial photographs (Zdanovich and Batanina 2007) or by means of geophysical prospection (Hanks et al. 2013; Patzelt 2013). According to these lines of evidence, the MBA settlements ranged from 1 to 3 ha in size and contained anywhere from 12 to 70 housing depressions, \~200 m2 each (Koryakova and Epimakhov 2007; Krause and Koryakova 2013; Zdanovich and Batanina 2007). Zdanovich and Zdanovich (1995:54) provided a population estimate of 2,000-3,000 people for the settlement of Arkaim based on the maximum number of people (30-50) that could pack into each of the 60 20×10 m structures in times of warfare escalation. Such demographic estimates have been considered unrealistically high (Epimakhov 2002a; Johnson and Hanks 2012; Kohl 2007), especially with researchers more recently agreeing on the fact that only portions of Sintashta structures were used as living quarters, with the rest of the space dedicated to metal or other craft production; storage; and perhaps keeping small domestic livestock during the harsh winter months (Johnson and Hanks 2012; Vinogradov 2011). More recent estimates, derived from placing 5-15 people into each structure, provide a range of 60 to 1,050 people per Sintashta settlement, with an average-size Sintashta town containing a few hundred (300-400) people (Johnson and Hanks 2012; Johnson 2014; Krause and Koryakova 2013:349).”*

Philip Kohl in his work also expresses the same view on the Sintashta population. The population was around in hundreds. \[3\]

*“ The encircled areas range in size from 0.6 to 3 ha. and contain projections and other features that safeguard passage into and out of the settlements. Their small size, however, undercuts the concept of a “Country of Towns” (or even worse, “Cities”). They are more accurately described as villages, probably containing several hundred inhabitants at most.”*

As seen in the table below, from various Sintashta settlements, the population estimates of Sintashta culture at max was around 8200 as per anthropologist Alan Johnson \[4\]

*” The estimation of population levels based on both ethnographic accounts and size of social versus economic area at the Sintashta settlements includes the production of maximum and minimum limits as well as the household area mean for each settlement. For instance, Arkaim has approximately 82 household structures, and has a lower estimate of 246 persons and an upper of 574 persons (Table 4.2). In addition, Alandskoye and Andreevskoye (each with approximately 70 household structures) most likely contain 210 to 490 persons. Furthermore, Stepnoye (50 household structures) and Chernorech’ye (26 household structures) most likely would contain: Stepnoye – 150 to 350 persons and Chernorech’ye – 78 to 182 persons. Just based on these estimates alone, there is a great deal of variation in the demographic possibilities for number of households in the Sintashta settlements. As a result, Epimakhov’s (2002a) and Kohl’s (2007: 14) more conservative estimates of several hundred people per settlement, with possibly as many as 400 or 500, seems increasingly plausible (Table 4.2). However, my primary focus is on the differences in projected population levels at Stepnoye (mean, 250 persons) and Chernorech’ye (mean, 130 persons) and what this means for population levels in the Late and Final Bronze Ages, and how it can be better related to demographic centralization and social organization in the Sintashta period.”*

As per the work by Ludmila Koryakova and Andrej Epimakhov, the northern and central Kazakhstan during the bronze age also had around 7000 estimated population at max. This zone was under the Andronovo culture, succeeding earlier Sintashta culture. This culture too is considered as representing the spread of Aryans. \[5\]

*“ The population density in this local region was about 0.008–0.011 individuals per one km2. As he estimates, in central and northern Kazakhstan (total area – about 400,000 km2), minimally thirty-five hundred to seven thousand people could live simultaneously. Probably they were organized into aggregates of taxonomic segments (tribal formations of different scale), which were linked by real or fictitious affinity, having common territory, name, rituals, culture, and possibly common language dialect. “*

So from all these details, let us combine the Sintashta and Andronovo population, 8000+7000 = 15000. Let us consider even higher population by giving it another 10000, including the population of south Kazakhstan, so it will be around 25000.

Even this combined population doesn’t match total population estimates of each large urban Harappan cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa which are between 30000-40000 \[6\]

*“ We may well wonder what would have been the population of these cities. Lambrick has made a convincing case for a figure of 35,000 at Moherno-daro, based upon comparison with the population of a city of comparable area in Sind in 1841. An independent estimate by Fairservis suggests a slightly higher figure (40,000). As Harappa appears to have been of roughly equivalent size, its population may well have been more or less the same, but Fairservis has suggested, figure of 23,500 for the lower city at Harappa, excluding the citadel.”*

Keep in mind there were other large and urbanized Harappan cities like Ganweriwala, Rakhigarhi, Dholavira etc which also hosted similar numbers of population. The total population of Harappan civilization during the mature period is said to be in millions and the civilization itself covered a much larger area than Ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia with many urban settlements.

So how did the few thousand people from the steppes manage to change the entire culture of Harappan region and other regions of northern India? Obviously not all of these 25000 steppe people moved into India as per Aryan invasion/immigration theory. Some split off and reached Iran and some stayed back. So the steppe movement would’ve been only limited to few thousand people. This small population would’ve created no big impact on native Harappan population.

In fact it is clear from the recent genetic studies that there was no large scale population movement from bronze age steppe into India. Narasimhan et al states even this early steppe admixture in Swat valley was through female line instead of a male dominant invasion, considering only 2 male samples out of 44 turned out to be patrilineal R1a Y DNA which is often associated with the ancient steppe populations as noted in the supplement material of the paper.

*“We observe only 2 R1a Y chromosomes among the 44 SPGT males in whom we could confidently determine a Y chromosome, corresponding to a ninety-five percent binomial confidence interval of 0.4-16% for the Y chromosome ancestry proportions derived from Central_Steppe_MLBA.”*

The earliest evidence of R1a from Swat valley is from 1000-800 BCE, that is already iron age in India. This is too late to date Aryan movements and the date of the early Vedic scriptures.

*“ Thus, the individuals for which we obtained DNA that we directly radiocarbon dated for this study do not have any evidence of coming from the earliest burial phase (1400-1100 BCE) and it is possible that our analysis is entirely reflecting individuals of the inter-phase and late phase.*“

” *Recent archaeological fieldwork (2014-2016) and radiocarbon dating from other Swat sites (Saidu Sharif, a cemetery dated to 500-200 BCE, and the multiphase settlement at Barikot) shows that the youngest date of the Swat Protohistoric Graves is around 800 BCE, which can be considered the most recent extent of the specific burial tradition and the associated material culture. “*

So in sum, there indeed was a population movement from steppes, but it was limited to a few thousand people, that too female oriented, compared to the much larger population which inhabited the Harappan regions.

Surely, by late Harappan times many people moved to the Ganga region and built the iron age Ganga civilization with Painted Grey Ware culture. But many still stayed back in former regions in the northwest.

We know what happened to the Mitanni Aryan elites in West Asia. They ruled over the local Hurrian population, but never managed to impose their Aryan culture on natives. They soon perished.

Even in historical times there were many movements of steppe populations like the Scythians, Yuezhi/Kushanas, Hephthalites etc into India. But none of them ever managed to change the native culture, rather they inevitably adopted the native culture and gradually got absorbed into it.

So we should not speculate about any large male dominant invasion into India from the steppes during 1700-1000 BCE, the supposed date of the AIT. The movement was never like a full fledged military invasion like during the later iron age or medieval era, but was rather a movement of a limited number of people.

Even the much cited Harvard Indologist Michael Witzel had earlier written how the invading Aryan war chariots acted as ‘tanks’ which struck terror to the native Indians of Punjab just like the terror the Aztecs and Incas felt by the arrival Spaniards who exterminated them.

*“In both scenarios the immigrant group was politically dominant because of its new military technology and tactics, especially the horse-drawn chariot which was quickly taken over by all major states in Egypt, Mesopotamia and China (Mair 1990: 44), although without taking over the language of the chariot drivers. The first appearance of thundering chariots must have stricken the local population with a terror similar to that experienced by the Aztecs and Incas upon the arrival of the iron-clad, horse-riding Spaniards.”*

However, he later preferred small-scale pastoral migrations ‘trickling in’ from the Afghan and Baluchi highlands.

*“In addition, smallscale semi-annual transhumance movements between the Indus plains and the Afghan and Baluchi highlands continue to this day (Witzel 1995: 322, 2000).*“

” *Why, then, should all immigration, or even mere transhumance trickling in, be excluded in the single case of the IAs, especially when the linguistic and cultural evidence so clearly speaks for it? Just one “Afghan” IA tribe that did not return to the highlands but stayed in their Panjab winter quarters in spring was needed to set off a wave of acculturation in the plains, by transmitting its ‘status kit’ (Ehret) to its neighbors.”*

But all likely these small scale nomadic pastoralists too would’ve been assimilated into the locals of Harappan regions which hosted much larger populations instead of imposing their culture on natives.

So, the bronze age steppes never hosted a large population which would’ve moved down south and changed the entire cultural and linguistic sphere of northern India and Iran. So I feel we should discard the old notions of a large scale male-based steppe Aryan conquest of India and Iran based on the realistic archaeological and genetic data we have now.
