From the Nastika Vinaya Pitaka, two volumes describing monks' secular life and deeds are of great value as they offer first-hand insights into public life in ancient India. These are the Kullavagga and Mahavagga compiled by the first century BC, mostly constituting monastic rules and ordinations. While skimming through the Mahavagga, we came across an attention-captivating paragraph [here](https://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe13/sbe1312.htm):

> If the upa*ggh*âya wishes to bathe, let him prepare a bath. If he > wants cold water, let him get cold water; if he wants hot water, let > him get hot water. If the upa*ggh*âya wishes to go to the > *g*antâghara, let the saddhivihârika knead the powder, moisten the > clay, take up the chair belonging to the *g*antâghara, follow the > upa*ggh*âya from behind, give him the chair, take his robe and put it > aside, give him the powder and the clay. If he is able, let him also > enter the *g*antâghara. When he is going to enter the *g*antâghara, > let him besmear his face with clay, cover himself from before and > behind, and thus enter the *g*antâghara. — Mahavagga I.13

The text instructs nastika monks to prepare baths for their preceptors and look after their needs well. We also learn of a*g*antâghara, which appears to be a unique bathroom equipped with chairs. From the description, we learn that the attendee was expected to besmear his face with kneaded moist clay before entering. Dr Bühler holds that*g*antâghara is a Pali corruption of the Sanskrit word Yantragr̥ha — a compound translating as “Mechanical House”. This term finds itself employed in a variety of Pali and Sanskrit texts with a variety of meanings ranging from a torture chamber employing mechanical devices to a safehouse with collapsable surfaces and stairs for hiding. While the Mahavagga doesn’t shed further light on our*g*antâghara in this context, we find it mentioned again in the Vinaya texts in the Kullavagga [next](https://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe20/sbe20086.htm):

Once again, we come across the*g*antâghara, translated as the hot bathroom here. We learn of an incident where senior monks haggled it all to themselves, earning the spite of junior monks. The junior monks then placed excess amounts of firewood in the fireplace, closed the bathroom doors and sat in front of it to block the exit. The senior monks fainted as a result, and the Sakamuni intervened to set up rules regarding the use of the hot bathroom. We learn of the various parts of the hot bathroom here, such as the antechamber, cooling room and hall. The structure of the hot bathroom is further elaborated in another book of the Kullavagga [here](https://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe20/sbe20029.htm#fn_250):

From the above discourse, many things become clear. First, we learn that these were private closed bathrooms, unlike the public ones which are noticed in the archaeological context. We learn that a cloister is built on high ground surrounded by an enclosure. Over which the bathrooms were built on a further elevated surface with stairs protected by railings. The bathroom seems to be divided into three sections — the cooling room, the main hall and the antechamber. The cooling room seems to be simply the room for cooling off oneself or perhaps changing one’s clothes and applying the moistened clay. The purpose of the unidentified moistened clay was to protect one’s face from being burned. Perhaps a function similar to modern sunscreen or moisturizers, although since we’ve never studied modern cosmetics, we can’t pinpoint it.

Cloister in an Enclosure from Europe — the green part is where an elevated hot bathroom would be built.

The main hall for bathing was a closed room with well-paved floors and drains. It had many chairs arranged in multiple rows. It also had a fireplace positioned either in between or at the corner, depending on the size of the main hall. To allow smoke from the fireplace to be released, the main hall also had a chimney. The bathing hall had stands holding water pots and saucers was used to pour water from them. The antechamber was a place filled with water built on an elevated height again that provided water to the main hall. The mechanism isn’t clear, however, since the problem of the antechamber’s height being too low is discussed — we believe that descending pipes were employed. Finally, we hear that the lack of perspiration was a problem, which was solved by replacing the thatched roofs with stone or brick ones. It undoubtedly indicated that the bath was a steam house, much like the Saunas of Finland.

An 1804 illustration depicting a Finnish sauna.

We learn the following about these saunas from the Wikipedia article here:

> The oldest known saunas in Finland were made from pits dug in a slope > in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna > featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. > Water was thrown on the hot stones to produce steam and to give a > sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature > so high that people could take off their clothes. The first Finnish > saunas were always of a type now called *savusauna*; "smoke sauna".

Much like our own description, it is built into an elevated level, contains a fireplace in the middle and has people sitting around without their robes, who are enjoying perspiration. This leaves little doubt that the Gantâghara-s mentioned are indeed Saunas, however, permanent structures built of stone, brick or wood. These Saunas were indeed a place for the privileged as we noted that they could cause a fight between senior and junior monks over their use and the fact that lay people and women were banned from entering them. A question concerning their utility in a tropical country like India is bound to arrive in the minds of our readers here. Why would a hot and humid country like India need something used in Finland? Regarding this, we should recognize that mortality was much higher in the past than in the modern or even pre-modern world. It was not unexpected for even a fully healthy young man to catch a cold during winters or rains and die afterwards. Thus, taking a steam bath in these times could do wonders for health. We should only remember the medicinal hot springs in East Asia and the far more technologically advanced heated baths of ancient Rome that were popular despite having a significant overlap with the Indian climate at times.
