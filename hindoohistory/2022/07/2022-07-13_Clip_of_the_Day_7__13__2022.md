“Brahmin missionary to American, Marayan Krishna filling the pulpit of All Souls church, Episcopal in this city by invitation last evening said in the course of her talk: 'We are overstocked with Christian missionaries. Ninety percent of those who we have are senseless. Furthermore, we don't want your religion and your holy book. We have more religion of our own than we know what do do with and a surplus we'd like to export. So I pray you Americans, keep your so-called missionaries at home. If you want to christianize us, send us some men that are qualified to reach, philosophers that know their own scripture. Until then Vedas, our four books of philosophy, are good enough for us. Show me a country where missionaries have been that is prosperous. It does not exist. There were no famines, no plague in India before English invasion. I am here in the interests of India for India, not India for England’"
