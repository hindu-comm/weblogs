"THE POOR HEATHEN"

"Gorgeous Houses of Worship and Manufactured Deities"

"Notwithstanding the efforts put forth in his behalf, he goes on in his heathenism, seeming to prefer his own darkness to the light of Christianity"

"In Christian lands 'the poor heathen' is the object of general and deep commiseration. Lecturers tell of his abject misery, clergyman descend on his benighted and pitiable condition, songs are written about him."

"Collections are taken up for him, money is poured out in a constant and ever-increasing stream for his benefit, for missionaries are every year more numerous; every year come demands for additional means to supply new fields of labor"

"Many sunday schools devote all their surplus collections to the missionary cause, many classes are organized for the purpose of supporting each a missionary in foreign lands; many societies are formed that one or more heathen children may be supported and kept at school to receive Christian education"

"For all this the poor heathen ought to be very thankful, but if reports of apparently trustworthy travelers are to be credited he does not show proper appreciation of the efforts put forth in his behalf, but goes on in his heathenism, seeming to prefer his own darkness to the light that can be shed upon him. No doubt great progress has been made by the missionaries, but that it is commensurate with the labor and expense can not be believed;"
