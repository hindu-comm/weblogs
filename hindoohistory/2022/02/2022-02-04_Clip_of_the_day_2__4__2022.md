From the Ogden Standard, 1909

"It is therefore a special opportunity that is given to the people of Ogden by the Methodist church, when Arthur Christner, a converted Hindoo, tells his story Sunday night. "He has had a remarkable leading to the truth and tells his story in a thrilling and unique way. He has spoken in leading churches on the Pacific coast and has already given a few talks in Ogden, which were enthusiastically received. He has the god which he worshipped up to the time when he was converted, but which is now broken. He will wear a native dress."
