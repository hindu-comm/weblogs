"Rev. Henry Horton, the converted High Caste Hindoo, a native of India, who tells the story of how he was converted from idol worship and the heathen customs of his own people, will lecture at the Apostolic Holiness Church here Friday, Jan. 12, at 8 p.m. and at the Salvation Army Hall Saturday, Jan. 13 at 8 o'clock p.m. Rev. Horton is a spirit-filled, consecrated man and you will enjoy listening to his pathetic story."  

"He gives lectures in his native costume and sings oriental songs. Be sure and hear him. Everybody welcome."
