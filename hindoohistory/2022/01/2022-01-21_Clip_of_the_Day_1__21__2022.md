'But the great mistake made by Americans is concerning the condition of the Hindu woman. I never heard until I came to this country that Hindu mothers throw their babies into the Ganges to be eaten by crocodiles. I have traveled in India from the mouth to the source of that mighty river and never heard of one single incident of that nature..."

"'Every one in this country appears to be familiar with the horrible story of the Juggernaut. I myself never heard until I came here of the supposed custom the Hindus have of throwing themselves under its wheels to obtain salvation. I was once at a festival where it was used, and I saw hundreds of men and women, many of them excited by religious enthusiasm, drawing this huge car. There may be accidents and it is easily seen how a person may lose their live when such does occur"
