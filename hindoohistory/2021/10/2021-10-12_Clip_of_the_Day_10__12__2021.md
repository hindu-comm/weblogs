“HAVE SORORITY GIRLS FALLEN FOR RUMORED ORIENTAL CULT?”

“Police probe alleged Hindu cult in Chicago University circles— may be
as big as Doc Hamish’s place— Grand Jury action hinted”

“According to the information now in the hands of police the cult
operates along the lines of the ‘sun cult’ which caused the conviction
of Doc Hamish for sending obscene matter through the mai. As is the case
of the Hamish cult, it is claimed this present cult is financed by
credulous wealthy women, who are lured to the cult’s strange Oriental
rites”
