"From the first the British found that the administration of government in India along European lines was a difficult and delicate undertaking. "The peculiar religious beliefs of the Hindus and many oriental customs unfathomable to the 'western' mind made it hard for Europeans to govern the country without gravely offending the natives"

"The Hindus cremated their dead, and one of their most inhuman customs was that of requiring a widow to die in the funeral pyre of her dead husband. This practice was called Suttee"

"At the annual festival of Vishnu at Puri in Orissa fanatical devotees formerly deemed it an act of extreme piety to throw themselves beneath the wheels of the great car of Juggernaut"
