"From the first the British found that the administration of government
in India along European lines was a difficult and delicate undertaking.
"The peculiar religious beliefs of the Hindus and many oriental customs
unfathomable to the 'western' mind made it hard for Europeans to govern
the country without gravely offending the natives"

husband. This practice was called Suttee"

"In 1818 the British authorities forbade Suttee and tried to break up
the practice, but it was carried on secretly for many years afterward.
Other revolting customs were abolished"

"At the annual festival of Vishnu at Puri in Orissa fanatical devotees
formerly deemed it an act of extreme piety to throw themselves beneath
the wheels of the great car of Juggernaut"

"One of the greatest services the British rendered India was the
stamping out of the thugs, a murderous cult, devotees of Siva, and the
Hindu Goddess of Destruction"

"The rigid and complex system of castes, which makes the proud parsee or
brahmin carefully avoid brushing against the untouchable, lest he become
defiled, has been the chief stumbling block to India's progress"

the times. 'Holy' fakirs still win prestige by publicly torturing
themselves, and sacred cattle roam at will and impede traffic in the
streets of the largest cities"
