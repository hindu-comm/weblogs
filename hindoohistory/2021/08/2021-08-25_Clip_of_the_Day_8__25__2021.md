An article from the Day Book, published in 1915, profiling the “high priestess of Christian Yoga,” Mrs. Jessie Babcock:

“Children May Select Parents At Rebirth, Is Doctrine of Yoga”

“Such is the philosophy of the Christian Yoga, a religion originated but three years ago, as enunciated by Mrs. Jessie Babcock, its ordained high priestess. Mrs. Babcock, who has been a student of comparative religions for many years, was compelled by the laws of Washington, where the Christian Yoga religion was originated, to become an ordained minister in order to carry out the healing which she says is part of the religion.”
