Clip of the Day 8/17/2021



From the Washington Times, May 17, 1908:

![“Mysterious Yoga Faith of East India Which has Robbed an American
Citizen of a Devoted
Wife”](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa896b140-1ba9-4814-b67c-35ee51fbfe46_598x394.jpeg "Image")

“‘You are my affinity no longer.’ It was with these words that Mrs. W.
E. Stone abandoned husband, children, home, country, and friends—gave up
her position as a leader of the exclusive society of LaFayette, Ind.,
where as the wife of the President of Purdue University, she reigned as
a queen, in an atmosphere of refinement and culture, amid an educational
environment beyond and above that of the ordinary mortal, where, it
seemed, she possessed all this world’s goods that normal mind could
crave.”

“It is a weird religion, that of Yoga, known in its generic form, but,
in its many mysterious ramifications, regarded in awesome ignorance.
That these fakers do perform some wonderful and singly impossible feats,
is attested by numerous reputable witnesses. But the power behind all
this is still a mystery, clothed in the impenetrable shroud of occultism
that only the East Indian can employ.”
