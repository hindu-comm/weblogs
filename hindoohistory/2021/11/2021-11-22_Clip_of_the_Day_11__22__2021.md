"Our Women Fakir's Prey" "'Just as long as foolish American women
continue to give money to Hindu fakirs, just so long will these Oriental
outcasts fatten on their credulity' is the verdict on East Indian
'swamis' in this country..."

"'Not so long ago a swami returned to India after a trip to this
country, most of which was spent in California. He had made money enough
to support him in luxury for the rest of his life and brought with him
three women from the Pacific Coast..."

"'Vivekananda, a swami who had lost standing and caste in India, secured
enough money from American women to enable him to build a magnificent
palace on the banks of the Ganges, where he lives in state"
