From the Los Angeles Herald, 1906:

"In presenting his 'Tales of Old Japan,' Mr. Milford said: 'The books
which have been written of late years about Japan have either been
compiled from official records or have contained the sketchy impressions
of passing travelers. Of the inner life of the Japanese the world at
large knows very little; their religion, their superstitions, their ways
of thought, the hidden springs by which they move-- all these are as yet
mysteries"

"What Mr. Milford writes about the superficial knowledge of the west
about real Japan is much more true about real India. Real life in India
is as invisible to the skipping globe trotter as even to the average
long resident Anglo-Indian. Even the longest resident westerner is too
busy making rupees, in having a grand time after the day's rupees are
made, to have any opportunity or inclination to acquire knowledge as to
how the natives of the soil, out of whom he makes the rupees live and
think. On the other hand, it is the business of the Christian
missionaries to misrepresent the 'heathen' who are the causes of their
support: As to Mr. and Mrs. Fixit's case to reform other people's home
before they reform their own."
