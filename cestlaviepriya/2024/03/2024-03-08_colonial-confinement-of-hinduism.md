Colonial Confinement of Hinduism

Before the British Crown officially took over the reins of their colonial empire in India, the preceding period of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was defining in more ways than one. Of course, common knowledge is that these years were laying the foundation for the events of 1857, but behind the political jargon and bureaucratic babble of the colonialists were religious underpinnings defining the actions of our ‘masters’, building a labyrinth for the Hindus in which the past and future image of India was being codified. No matter what our actions had been in the past and disregarding what they might be in future, a template was contrived on the basis of which India and Hinduism were to be appraised.

And, it was not just the battles fought between the Indians and the British that did the work but more importantly, the ascending Evangelical and Utilitarian voices in Britain that set the tone for the future. But these were not the lone voices; there were also those westerners, particularly British whose intellectual pursuits in trying to understand the Orient were criticised by the British as sympathetic towards our culture and people and hailed for the same reasons by the Indians. While not disregarding the contribution of these intellectuals and even their sympathies, their religious motives and guidelines behind their scholarly researches are usually ignored and the extent of their sympathies increasingly blown out of proportion.

This essay is an attempt to delve on these religious underpinnings common to both our detractors and our sympathizers to understand the rules that had been created for us. For this, rather than going through each and every examples from respective categories, I will rather discuss the case of few typical representatives of each. But, before discussing the period of these researches of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, a mention of its preceding period needs to be made.

**§** **Background**

Hinduism, even though still largely characterised as ‘deplorable paganism’, in this period a germination of relatively nuanced European opinions on this ancient religion were noticeable. The early views of the English about Hinduism had started to develop a sense of understanding, even certain respect when they had learnt of those doctrines which ascribed to one supreme religious entity. Example of such views can be seen from the case of an early seventeenth century report of Henry Lord, the English chaplain at Surat – “…Though their ceremonies were a may-game of superstition, the Hindus did give worshippe to God” (Marshall, 1970; 21). In another example, François Bernier, the seventeenth century French physician and traveler found some ‘redeemable’ qualities in Hinduism when at Benares, he met ‘the chief of the Pandets’, who told him that God alone was ‘absolute, and the only omnipotent lord and master’ (Marshall, 1970; 21). The missionaries and Jesuits agreed that, ‘whatever might be its practice… the theory of Hinduism implied worship of a single supreme being.’ The Hindu doctrine of immortality of soul found resonance among them even if ‘contaminated…with unacceptable beliefs in transmigration or in the individual soul as an emanation of brahman seeking unity with brahman’, ‘too ridiculous or extravagant’ to their Christian senses (Marshall, 1970; 21-22).

Thus, the most ‘charitable’ and ‘sympathetic views’ of seventeenth century found that Hindu moral teaching can be ‘sometimes commended’, even though ‘deplorable’. In another example Captain Hamilton reported about the Hindus: ‘many of them practice very much holiness in their lives by the help of morality’ (Marshall, 1970; 21). But this was farthest extent of these exceptionally ‘sympathetic’ opinions as opposed to the general Europeans view of Hindu practises as ‘ridiculous and disgusting’ (Marshall, 1970; 21). Even when some practices and doctrines were considered somewhat palatable, nothing excused the open rejection of Christianity that Hindus exemplified just by their sheer existence.

“…Books were filled with accounts of a multiplicity of deities, repellent images and barbarous customs. Most early travellers concluded that the Hindus were no more than idolaters, worshipping images or natural objects. This was the theme of the first Portuguese accounts from the Malabar Coast. The seventeenth-century English traveller, William Bruton, described the Bengalis as ‘barbarous and idolatrous people’, who worshipped the sun and the moon, animals and plants. Even in the early eighteenth century the Jesuit Pierre Martin told his correspondents: ‘… you wou’d scarce believe me, shou’d I name the vile and infamous creatures to which they pay divine honours. ‘Tis my opinion, that no idolatry among the ancients was ever more gross, or more horrid, than that of these Indians” (Marshall, 1970; 20-21).

While this is an example of a typical censure of Hindus by Christian Europeans which can be ascribed to their monotheistic repulsion of the polytheistic customs, there is something much more complex under the surface. If we notice the last line of the above quote — ‘no idolatry among the ancients was ever more gross, or more horrid, than that of these Indians’ –- a comparison, a hierarchy can be seen even in our status amongst the ancients (here euphemism for pagan) which in my opinion had two fold reasons. The first quite obvious one was that we the Hindus were a polytheistic civilization that was very much not dead, the shock of our existence to majority of these people fueled their disgust and second, that we were an existing polytheistic civilization with majority dark complexioned population. So, the Hindus were and to a great extent still are an abomination not just to their monotheistic minds but to their monotheistic racist minds that put us unfavourably even amongst other ancient polytheistic dead civilizations.

However deplorable the Hindus were in the eyes of these monotheists, our existence still had to be explained just like the ancient Greeks and Romans had to be explained by early Christians –- ‘even the smallest particles of grain in a welter of pagan chaff required explanation’ (Marshall, 1970; 22).

The explanations, according to Marshall were either natural or historical. Natural explanations stated that “…pagans had stumbled on intimations of truth through the use of God-given reason or through the contemplation of a divinely ordered universe. Thomas La Grue in his ‘Avis au lecteur’, added in 1670 to the French translation of Abraham Roger’s book on Hinduism, wrote that God had left the Hindus in ignorance because of their sins, ‘mais il ne s’est toutesfois laissé inconnu parmy eux; ils ont peu facilement trouver le Dieu invisible par les choses visibles et par leurs causes’ (‘but he did not, however, leave himself unknown among them; they cannot easily find the invisible God through visible things and their causes’) (Marshall, 1970; 22). And historical explanations, ‘accepted virtually by all Christians throughout the eighteenth century’ were related to the Biblical stories like the Tower of Babel.

“….Hindus and all other pagans had been part of a single undivided human race until the building of the Tower of Babel, when the peoples of the earth had been scattered. Until the dispersion, all the human race had accepted the simple truth of the unity of God; after the dispersion, the Jews alone remained faithful, but any traces of monotheism in others could be attributed to distant recollections of the remote past. The translation of the Abbé Guyon’s History of the East Indies Ancient and Modern, which appeared in 1757, is an example of this type of explanation. ‘Altho’ the Indians are descended from Shem, whose posterity preserved the memory of the true God for a longer time than those of Ham and Japhet, yet the darkness which spread itself over every human mind effaced the idea which the Creator had imprinted there; and they transferred their homage to the sun, the moon, to trees, and other sensible objects. But ‘whether from the remains of tradition, or the light of nature alone’, they continued to acknowledge ‘one God creator of the universe…” (Marshall, 1970; 22-23).

These historical explanations were important in the sense that these conventions were believed not just by a typical dogmatic Christian of the time but even by those Europeans who professed much more sympathetic attitude towards Hindus, for example by men like William Jones whose brief period is claimed by some as the romantic period mark\[ing\] a transitional moment between . . . opposed sets of colonial projects” (Lussier, 2006; 99).

**§ Sympathisers and Christian Motives**

Arrival of William Jones (1746-1794), a Judge in the Supreme Court of Calcutta (Tremblay, 2014: 36) and a philologist on the scene started a relatively different approach towards Hindus, a period of “cultural empathy” for the “the dynamism and diversity of Indian culture” (Lussier, 2006; 98) and a kind of “positive passion” through which Jones wanted to “serve people . . . \[and\] serve humanity, a goal requiring his return to Orientalism” (Cannon, 194, 195) (Lussier, 2006; 98). The basic rule of historical studies is to not take personalities out of the context of their culture and the age they lived in. Never minding the non-compliance of this rule with regard to the Orient; it is then quite obvious that Jones’ work had Christian background. But it is important to note that his work had Christian motives as well, a far stronger element in my opinion which had huge impact on his researches.

Through his studies, Jones was seeking confirmations of Mosaic ethnography and the attendant Biblical chronology (Johnson, 2010; 81). “The ultimate goal toward which he organized his lectures was ‘scientific’ validation of the Genesis account” (Lincoln as cited in App, 2009: 3). Therefore, his researches in the ‘orient’ were an attempt to find humanity’s primeval religion before the deluge (App, 2009: 9) in the hallowed tradition of prisca theologia i.e. ancient theology (App, 2009: 9).

Therefore, his projects were not primarily linguistic or ethnological but theological i.e. inspired by an analogous theological and historical outlook (App, 2009: 9). His search was the search for a ‘true history’ in the pagan mythologies, albeit in a distorted form (Mukherjee, 1968; 101). Though rather interestingly, the biblical mythologies despite being Asian in origin were still somehow in his mind, European. That is why, the Hindus had to be the descendents of Ham (Johnson, 2010; 81); the Matsya Avatāra which he found in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa had to be ‘that of Noah disguised by Asiatick fiction’ (Mukherjee, 1968; 101).

Thus, the polytheists, especially Hindus were to be studied not only for scholarly pursuits but for explaining, even certifying Christian historiography and, ‘reconciling the polytheism of ancient religions and their heterodox moralities with the beliefs of Christianity’ (Johnson, 2010; 81). But, even to these sympathetic scholars, more was needed to make Hinduism more ‘palatable’ to their Christian sensibilities. A more concrete doctrine ‘sensible’ enough had to there in the Hindu scriptures so that their liking towards the Orient can be explained away back home, almost as if to assuage their guilt for studying an undead polytheistic civilization in a positive manner. This doctrine was the Hindu Vedānta.

Of course, the existence of non-duality of God and the human soul espoused by Śaṅkara’s Vedānta was not clearly known to them before, even though hints of this had already started to be known as mentioned above. Hence, these British intellectuals of the period could not have been in search of something they did not have a prior idea of but it certainly, even instantly made Hinduism more acceptable to their Christian conventions. And the primacy in popular culture of this doctrine in the West can partly be seen originating in this period for these reasons. Transmigration of soul, one of the main doctrines of Hinduism strongly affected Jones’ opinions vis-á-vis Christian doctrine of punishment and eternity of pain (Mukherjee, 1968; 119). He had said —

“I am no Hindu but I hold the doctrine of the Hindus concerning a future state to be incomparably more rational, more pious and more likely to deter men from vice than the horrid opinions inculcated by the Christians on punishment without end” (Mukherjee, 1968; 119).

In the opinion of even these sympathetic intellectuals, finding of the doctrine of Vedānta was important not just in making Hinduism acceptable for the western world, but in their opinions, to bring Hindus closer to their versions of Christianity which even though not in compliance with the Evangelicals, but was decidedly still very Christian. Jones, impressed by Richard Price’s Sermon (1787) said —

‘..after this publication by good old Price, the Church of England as it is called would inevitably fall and the Religion of the Gospel be substituted in its place’ (Mukherjee, 1968; 118). This sermon if translated into Persian and Sanskrit might convince the Muslims and the Hindus of the superiority of Christianity. In fact the Hindus would have less difficulty ‘in admitting the thirty-nine articles; because if those articles were written in Sanskrit they might pass well enough for the composition of a Brahmin.” The Brahmins would not find it difficult to follow the Christian conception of one God (Mukherjee, 1968; 118).

The result of these studies was the emergence of an artificial distinction between ‘popular’ Hinduism and ‘philosophical’ Hinduism in western interpretations (Marshall, 1970; 20) -– a view which is unfortunately still very much dominant in Indology. The philosophical doctrines were more fashionable to them unlike the outright polytheistic practices and rituals which induced nothing but abhorrence. Important to note that even these philosophical studies of Hinduism, divorced from their popular Hindu milieu were explained in terms that were comprehensible to their Christian sensibilities. 

Again, given the context of the time period these studies were done in, it is understandable that these scholars tried to ascertain the Hindu concepts in their own terms but what is neither understandable nor acceptable is that their interpretations of a compartmentalized Hinduism were made mainstay of all the studies and researches on our religion.

And with absolute ruthless dominance of the western order, the world was taught a western interpretation of Hinduism; Hindus were taught western interpretation of Hinduism.

With time, these interpretations were treated as the ‘true’ interpretations, and explanations that diverged from ‘the truth’ invited the ridicule of ‘the masters’. Popular Hindu manifestations were condemned or ridiculed, but most writers were prepared to admit the existence of metaphysical assumptions and ethical doctrines in Hinduism of which they could approve because they seemed to be similar to western concepts, although the similarities which they found depended largely on the inability of Europeans to describe a religious system except in Christian terms (Marshall, 1970; 20).

Despite these positive impressions of Hinduism, this was farthest which even these sympathizing studies could reach in their assessment of our religion. The superiority of Europe was never under question. For Jones, reason and taste were still ‘the grand prerogatives of European minds’ and ‘Europe, a sovereign princess and Asia her handmaid’ (Mukherjee, 1968; 120). Jones view in this regard is an eye opener —

“Asia had no conception of freedom. If every reader of history would open his eyes to some very important conclusions which flow from the whole extent of it, he could not but remark the constant effect of despotism in benumbing and destroying all those faculties which distinguish men from the herd that grazes; and to that cause he would impute the decided inferiority of most Asiatick nations, ancient and modern to those in Europe who are blest with happier governments” (Mukherjee, 1968; 120).

Nevertheless, for Jones, fascination of the exotic perfectly aligned with his belief in the European superiority. And just as superiority of Europe was unquestionable, so was the authority of Britain over the teeming masses of India and the British Constitution the greatest achievement of human wisdom (Mukherjee, 1968; 120). But for all the researches and studies that Jones rather painstakingly conducted and his relatively sympathetic leanings towards Hinduism, readers will certainly find it interesting that he had planned an epic poem ‘Britain Discovered’ to be written in praise of the British constitution, in which gods and heroes from India would come to pay homage at the nuptials of Britan (Royalty) and Albion (Liberty) (Mukherjee, 1968; 120). The union of Royalty and Liberty could only be found in the British constitution which made Britain far superior to any other nation in the world. This love for the British constitution and a sense of the superiority of Europe in the field of science and law, were dominant emotions in Jones’s mind, as was the romantic fascination which the exotic had for him (Mukherjee, 1968; 120)

**§** **The Evangelic Turn**

While men like Jones were working to understand the ‘exotic orient’ despite its polytheism, they themselves were being severely criticized by the Evangelicals and Utilitarians, never mind the popularity of their works like translation of Kālidāsa’s Śakuntalā amongst European literary circles. And these criticisms grew in intensity with time as religious Christian factions slowly started to dominate the English opinion on India and the Hindus. Paganism became a subject of study by the ‘irreligious’ in order to examine the ‘joyousness, hedonism, sexual permissiveness or…naturalness and innocence of pantheons such as the Greek, Hindu, and Polynesian’ (Johnson, 2010; 81). This was despite the fact that in no sense these ‘sympathetic’ opinions had ever disregarded the superiority of the British and the religion of Christianity in the slightest. Due to his professed Christianity, some of these criticisms did not mention Jones amongst the other preceding ‘irreligious’ who were studying these pagan religions but others (Johnson, 2010; 81) still castigated his work.

“…the religious tenor of Jones’ ‘Hymns’” was criticised, “…recognising in them the legitimisation, and celebration, of a Hindu exegesis.” Not only Jones’ poetic talents and Christian sincerity was questioned, but also “the very system of ‘tolerance’ and ‘theism’ that his ‘Hymns’ represent and for which they advocate. By showcasing an unabashed enthusiasm for ‘pagan…abominations’, Jones’ ‘Hymns’, and thus his syncretic methodology, betray a religious ‘neutrality’ and bear witness to an act of pure heresy…” (Johnson, 2010; 218).

By the late 1820s, these opinions ruled the conduct of the British Colonial Government in India. No one can more perfectly exemplify these opinions than Thomas Babington Macaulay. His censure of the Oriental knowledge is too infamous to need a mention but opinions of men like him were made the law of our land under the British yoke. The hatred of this ideology ridiculed every European attempt made, both in the past and the present to understand Indians in general and Hindus in particular. And strong measures were taken to nip those in the bud to prevent any future ‘transgressions.’ Macaulay’s derision towards Lord Ellenborough is the prime example of this ideology — ’the most erratic and vainglorious of India’s Governors-General’ who tried to somewhat restore the Somnath Temple and what he thought as its doors from Afghanistan in 1842 (Keay, 2001/1981; 130). Macaulay berated Ellenborough for his actions in these words —

‘We decorated the temples of false gods’, ‘we provided the dancing girls, we gilded and painted the images…‘I am ashamed to name those things to which he \[Ellenborough\] is not ashamed to pay public reverence (the sacred Siva lingam, the emblem of vice in words of Macaulay).’ (Keay, 2001/1981; 130).

There is a common view which ascribes the development of researches and studies in Indology in this period like those of men like James Prinsep and Alexander Cunningham to the British Colonial Government’s support. But with such men like Macaulay directing the British policy, it should hardly come as a surprise that Prinsep and Cunningham were working despite the contemporary British system not because of it. And even though now famous, their discoveries made little impact outside the world of scholarship (Keay, 2001/1981; 79).

While Prinsep was extremely apprehensive about asking Lord Auckland for help in getting a copy of the Girnar inscription (Keay, 2001/1981; 79), Cunningham had to wait long before pursuing Indian archaeology (Keay, 2001/1981; 79).

In response to repeated representations from the Asiatic Society, Markham Kittoe, the coal prospector, was given some limited archaeological responsibilities in the late 1840s. But the funds provided were inadequate. Kittoe could spare little time from other duties, and anyway he soon died. In the words of a later Governor-General, ‘the scheme appears to have been lost sight of within two or three years of its adoption’ (Keay, 2001/1981; 79).

This period brought the Christian and Colonial despise to the forefront, so much so that men like Sir John William Kaye, the British military historian, civil servant and army officer in India generally considered rather liberal and sympathetic in his assessments as compared to the other British opinions of his times, was not at all different from the other typical English racists of his period when he wrote: ‘…Brahminism is the most monstrous system of interference and oppression that the world has ever yet seen and… it could be maintained only by ignorance and superstition of the grossest kind’ (Mason, 1986/1974; 259).

**§** **Western Hierarchy of Oriental Religions**

The nineteenth century saw germination of a western hierarchy of Eastern religions in which Hinduism was pitted in the lowest rungs. This was most apparent in case of Buddhism than any other Indian religion. The intention behind especially including Buddhism in this essay is not to critique its doctrines vis-à-vis Hinduism but to show how and why Buddhism slowly but surely emerged as the more favourable and acceptable, or rather palatable Oriental religion in the western world and how this affected the perceptions about Hindus, both at that time and for future Western assessments.

It is important to note that even in the early 1790s, Buddhism was still considered a sect of Hinduism and not a religion on its own terms until 1804, when it became officially defined in British dictionaries as one (Johnson, 2010; 28-29). And the Asiatick Society, established by William Jones proved crucial for the “reemergence” of Buddhism into European consciousness (Lussier, 2006; 99). It was through men like Sándor Csoma de Kőrös, a Hungarian philologist and Orientalist, whose work on the Tibetan-English Dictionary and Tibetan Grammar appeared in the Journal of the Asiatick Society of Bengal that Buddhism was brought to the attention of the western world. And, ‘once it circulated out of Calcutta into the centers of Oriental studies in Europe’, it gave great impetus to Buddhist studies in the west.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, through studies like those of Burnouf, Buddhism gathered admirers in the west with great speed. In line with these were the works of James Prinsep whose deciphering of the Brahmi script brought Mauryan Emperor Aśoka to the forefront and work of Alexander Cunningham did the same for various Buddhist structures within India.

The timing of these emerging studies on Buddhism in the West and the kind of positive reception that they were accorded there was in stark contrast to the severe condemnation of Hinduism due to the Evangelic and Utilitarian policies in this period. The brief reprieve from the preceding period of “cultural empathy” was long over.

There were two main factors behind these developments. One, the above mentioned religious Christians i.e. Evangelic and Utilitarians whose policies were governing India and two, those under the impression of Enlightenment and Romanticism who were in rejection of any kind of theism. The former included men like Macaulay who abhorred Hinduism for its pagan existence, and any support for idolatry was rejected on grounds of being utterly revolting to their Christian sensibilities, while the latter included men like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche who favoured Buddhism due to their opinions of Buddhism ‘being a religion without dogma and committed to deconstruction’ and it being ‘…the only really positivistic religion history’ has shown them’ (Lussier, 2006; 104).

“Buddhism emerged with clarity and force in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, with centers of Orientalism in Russia, France, Germany, and England offering a widening flow of translations that served to solidify Buddhism as a viable alternative to the perceived logocentric excesses of European cultural forms and its emphasis on “sin” (Lussier, 2006; 104-105).”

In India as well, Hinduism found itself pitted unfavourably against Buddhism. When Cunningham conducted his finds of Sanchi stupa, he published them in the book titled The Bhilsa Topes and made his case for supporting Indian Archaeology through the appeal of Buddhism – “The money saved by no longer financing the publication of Sanskrit works could well be spent on exploring other stupas” (Keay, 2001/1981; 80).

“The weight of anti-Orientalist prejudice had fallen on Hindu literature, so Cunningham tried to make it clear that archaeology was worthy of separate consideration and that Buddhism was altogether less objectionable than Hinduism. Buddhist sculpture was never obscene and, since Buddhism was dead in India, there was no question of offering encouragement to pagans” (Keay, 2001/1981; 80-81).

Thus, on one hand as per dogmatic Christians that formed the majority opinion of the western world, Buddhism found more support vis-à-vis Hinduism because its paganism was more palatable. And, within Indian boundaries, the support for Buddhism was because it was less pagan and quite dead unlike Hinduism. On the other hand, Hinduism with its pronounced religiosity was too much for those seeking rejection of theism. Hinduism was condemned by conservative Christians for being **poly**-theistic; condemned by the Romantics, the Enlightened and the emerging atheists for being poly-**theistic**; and condemned for being **polytheistic** by those who claimed to be atheistic but their opinions still very much governed by their Christian sensibilities. Indian studies, having started with a strong literary and Hindu bias under Jones, were now swinging too far towards Buddhism and archaeology which also favoured the less pagan Buddhism.

But given the Evangelical legacy, it is hard to see the government willingly financing a specific study of, say, Hindu sculpture (Keay, 2001/1981; 82).

**§ Mask of Benovelonce**

While the war of Independence of 1857 did nothing to change these views, in fact even hardened their prejudices, it did dawn upon the colonial government that slight course-correction was required. The overtly pronounced Evangelical policies of the British colonial government were now couched under the ‘benevolence of the crown’. Nevertheless, in India the Macaulay-ian policies of the British were still continued and even promoted. The only difference being that the detractors of Hinduism were not as outspoken as before.

“An interest in native culture could now be forgiven, even applauded, on the grounds of its political expediency (Keay, 2001/1981; 81).”

**§ Remarks**

The proclaimed premise of the British Empire was that it was the civilizing force to the barbaric, the light to the Oriental darkness which interestingly sounds quite similar to the Islamic concept of *jahalat* but its marketing was very different compared to how Islam had spread in India. This time the invasion happened not just through brute force – it was at first, mercentalized and then intellectualized. In the process of this intellectualization of India, various attempts and researches were conducted by the western enthusiasts to understand her and its primary religion Hinduism. But as just discussed, with motives being heavily biased with Christian sensibilities of even those who claimed to have ‘cultural empathy’, the results merely reinforced a binary image of Hindu India – she either had to be the land of the most ignoble pagan savagery, even worse than ancient pagans of other parts of the world according to Evangelics or the land of fabled exotics according to sympathizers. India was everything except a living, breathing, very religious civilization, with its own living, breathing people, with their own virtues and follies.

It is apparent from this study is that behind the painstaking research and analyses by both our western detractors and sympathizers, the motive was largely to search for confirmations of their pre-conceived notions. While this was apparent with regard to conservative Christians but vague with regard to the sympathizers. Accepting this certainly does not mean discrediting significant contributions of the latter in their respective fields vis-à-vis India and Hinduism but it is to show that even those sympathizers were basing their studies on very different foundations than what we Hindus may have believed, with quite different motives then what we in our uninformed opinions ascribe to them retrospectively.

Hinduism was interpreted on the basis of western rationality, the inherent definition of this religion had been pre-determined and its worth decided by how close or far Hindus were to those pre-conceived conventions. We were dissected away from our own context.

Even though it is understandable, even given that their work would have been based on western contexts during early colonial period but despite being too far removed from the period of colonialism, these factions are still predominant in deciding the perception of Indians, especially of Hindus who are interpreted from western contexts, not of their own. Those researches thus formed opinions that seem to have frozen in time, becoming a holy grail and if Hindus are to be understood, it has be within its confines, by westerners and Indians both, and any work challenging these confines treated as heresy. These confines guided the entire stream of Indology that as mentioned above, contrived a distinction between ‘philosophical’ and ‘popular’ Hinduism in order to make it more palatable to their western sensibilities. For anyone aware of modern discourse, this distinction became the source for an artificial divorcing of ‘Vedic’ and ‘Puranic’ Hinduism.

Other view which was mainstreamed was the western acceptability of the doctrine of Vedānta vis-à-vis other doctrines of Hinduism as mentioned above. I absolutely do not mention this to criticize the non-dualistic streams in Hinduism but to highlight the fact that the reason this was made more acceptable in the western world was to make Hinduism compatible and more palatable to western Christian sensibilities. The other obvious aspects of Hinduism like idol worship, its rituals, its popular culture were found too grotesque, too pagan to be acceptable.

As discussed above, this also resulted in a binary interpretation of Hinduism. It was either berated as the most horrible manifestation of paganism — ‘no idolatry among the ancients was ever more gross, or more horrid, than that of these Indians’ — its rituals, its scriptures the most ignoble or it was intellectualized and confined to its philosophical doctrines palatable to the western sensibilities, its popular aspects, its ritual and practical manifestations condemned as superfluous. And thus, it was found unfavourable within the western contrived hierarchy of oriental religions.

**§** **Conclusion **

What I find interesting is that motives of these sympathizers were never hidden, in fact they were even proclaimed in very clear terms. After all, books have been written precisely on this topic, and some of those are source for this blog post. Nevertheless, these motives lapsed into oblivion. While colonialism and the subsequent world order dominated by the West solidified their interpretations of Hinduism as the only ‘true’ interpretations, it has been a long time since 1947 and since then, only our weakness, ignorance and unwillingness has kept us in the dark. The biased world order has and will make our work much more difficult than those of other religious groups but it cannot be anymore an excuse for our ignorance of our own history. Our context was, is and will be deprived from us; it is our duty to snatch it back.
