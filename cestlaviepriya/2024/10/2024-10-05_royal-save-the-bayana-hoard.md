Royal Save: The Bayānā Hoard

**‘their preservation was as miraculous as their rediscovery was fortuitous.’**

**—** John Keay, India Discovered.

This statement was made with regarding the famous Ajantā cave paintings. But the same can be very easily applied to a many of Indian historical discoveries. For a civilization as ancient and yet as understudied as India, each and every new historic discovery or rediscovery is a blessing, not only for the academics and amateur history enthusiasts but even for a mere curious layman. Every nugget of information provides another piece for solving this giant, frustratingly beautiful puzzle that is our past.

And so it happens that the blessings of the gods sometimes brings forth not just nuggets, but a treasure hoard of evidence — quite literally. One such fortuitous rediscovery is my concern in this write up and the notable role of the ruler of a princely state — Mahārājā Sawāī Brijendra Singh of Bharatpur in recovering the treasure for posterity is going to be discussed in this post.

**§ Background — **

Without delving deep in the history of the region which would be a digression from the topic we are concerned with, a small introduction is pertinent nonetheless. Bharatpur — a district in western Indian state of Rājasthān has traditionally been part of the Braj region of north India. In its recent history, the city Bharatpur was the capital of the Kingdom of Bharatpur, established by the Hindu Jāṭ ruler Sūraj Mal in 1732-1733 CE. The House of Bharatpur traced its roots to the old Sinsinwār Jāṭ clan. Col. H. H. Brijendra Singh (r. 1929-1947) was its 14^(th) and the last ruler before him signing the Instrument of Accession and merging his state with the newly independent Dominion of India in 1947. 

The focal point of our story is the historic town of Bayānā in Bharatpur which in the medieval period had been the stronghold of Jādaun Rājpūt rulers. In the period post-Ghurid Islamic invasion of India, it was ruled firstly by the Delhi Sultanate and then the Mughal Empire before becoming part of the Kingdom of Bharatpur in the eighteenth century. The last ruler of Bharatpur, Mahārājā Brijendra Singh was himself quite an interesting figure. A voracious reader, he had an excellent library in his capital and was equally, or rather more strongly fascinated with hunting. The isolated Ghanā jheel (lake) of Bharatpur, now Keolādeo Ghanā National Park — a bird sanctuary of exceptional biodiversity was at the time known for its duck-shooting on a royal scale. The triannual hunting period at the beginning and end of the cold season was specifically marked for this very purpose. And, one such hunting expedition proved fruitful for Indian history.

**§ Cartridges & Gold — **

In January of 1946, the Mahārājā had been on one of his hunting expeditions. But in the subsequent days, three curious children — Jitamall, Bābū and Tulsī of the village Naglā Chhela embarked on sort of an expedition of their own, searching for empty cartridge shells from their ruler’s last hunting expedition. On 17^(th) of February, these children ‘suddenly lighted upon the edge of the pot showing through the earth.’ The find spot was actually ‘the eastern embankment of a low-lying field to the east of Naglā Chhela, belonging to one Bhoreyā Gūjar.’

This ‘embankment was hardly two feet in height, and the pot which contained the hoard, was just below the surface, hardly six inches under the ground. Its edge was accidently detected when a small shrub above it was removed by those three children.’

The find spot was actually within the boundary of the Hullanpurā in Bayānā, Bharatpur but since the coins were recovered by the villagers of Naglā Chhela, earlier reports mentioned the latter as its find spot. ‘The hoard therefore should have been correctly described as Hullanpurā (Bayānā) hoard, but for the sake of convenience,’ it was designated as the Bayānā hoard. Unbeknownst to the kids, they had stumbled on one of the largest single find of coin hoard from ancient India containing more than two thousand gold coins! However, the kids thought that the pot contained merely copper buttons and immediately showed it as such to their parents. Though uneducated, the villagers were smart enough to quickly realise that this was actual, real gold. Swiftly, these parents brought the vessel home, and as this news spread, some 282 or 285 coins were unfortunately distributed amongst the villagers and some were even converted to ornaments. 

**§ The Recovery —**

Thankfully, before any further damage could be done, the Bharatpur state authorities had learnt of the events and ‘with a successful promptitude, of which we have few instances on record,’ under the orders of Mahārājā Brijendra Singh, the police arrived at the scene and the remaining 1821 coins of the hoard were brought to Bharatpur. And, the villagers were fined with Rs. 12,680 on the basis of a price of Rs. 45 a coin melted by them. What is even more notable is that the authorities did not stop at merely collecting the hoard but the Mahārājā, realising the historical significance of this exceptional find, decided to invite Dr. Anant Sadāshiv Altekar — one the most acclaimed historian, archaeologist, and numismatist of India at the time to Bharatpur ‘with a view to assess the value of the hoard.’

**§ The Study —**

Altekar, who at the time was the Chairman of the Numismatic Society of India, came to Bharatpur in May, 1947. Though we, the readers cannot be in the know of actual feelings of Dr. Altekar when he personally examined the coins for the first time, but as history enthusiasts, we can definitely speculate and understand how exhilarated and excited he must have been. As he made a preliminary examination of the hoard, it instantly became clear that the find was of ‘unique importance, as so big a hoard, and with so many types and varieties, had never been discovered and recovered.’ Altekar spared no time in reporting to the Mahārājā about the magnitude of the work that was further required to do a proper scholarly research on such a project — ‘a proper classification of the coins, he added, would require a prolonged examination and a scientific catalogue of the hoard, adequately illustrated, would be a boon to the world of scholars.’ As Altekar correctly discovered, this was the first find of such importance and volume and, as it was eventually found, the coins belonged to the ancient India’s golden period and to her most illustrious royal dynasties — the Guptas.

Somehow, the two interests of the Mahārājā — reading and hunting had unexpectedly ended up in a very curious common project which thus ended up being a gift to the Indian numismatics and therefore, her history. In the words of the Mahārājā himself: ‘…It became clear to me that I should spare no troubles in getting the catalogue of the hoard published in an adequate manner, so that the world of Indology may have a worthy book for study and reference. I therefore decided to invite Dr. Altekar once more to Bharatpur for the purpose of classifying the coins and taking down notes for the preparation of the Catalogue.’ 

As promised, the Bharatpur ruler did what was required and more. ‘A large staff was placed at his (Altekar’s) disposal, so that the preliminary work may be finished as soon as possible.’ The task at hand was certainly not easy. Altekar studied the hoard ‘during two more visits in 1948 and 1949,’ and it was only after an in depth research that the work for the Catalogue could be completed. The Archaeological Department did its part by ‘sending its photographer to photograph the important coins of the hoard, selected for illustration.’ The Bayānā hoard was to be a unique one for more than one significant reason. As previously mentioned, it was the ‘biggest hoard of ancient Indian gold coins that was ever discovered and recovered in the history of Indian Archaeology.’

**The hoard was the biggest find of such kind at the time and as decades have passed since then, it still retains that place.**

**§ The Significance —**

To give the idea of its scale, it is important to note that since the first hoard of Gupta coins was discovered in 1783 from Kālīghāṭa near Calcutta (now Kolkātā) that contained more than 200 coins, to the Jhūsi hoard (the last hoard discovered before the Bayānā one) opposite Allāhābād (Prayāga) that contained not more than 20 to 30 pieces — the number of coins never really reached beyond 200 in a single find of around thirteen odd findings before Bayānā. In fact, the majority of the hoards were limited to around 15-20 coins. Another important fact is that the majority of these pre-Bayānā findings had been in what were the central and eastern parts of the Gupta Empire from the modern districts like Gorakhpur, Baliā, Mirzāpur, Prayāga, Kolkātā, Jaunpur etc. The only exception was the Mithāthal hoard found from Hissār district of the then province of Punjāb (now in Haryāṇā) in 1915-16. Thus, the situation of the finding was also quite unique. Despite so many discoveries, the time period when these earlier hoards were discovered hampered any serious numismatic study by scholars and therefore, very few of them were published. The Mirzāpur hoard of 40 gold Gupta coins discovered at Tekri Debrā in the Mirzāpur district of the then United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) in 1909 was in fact the ‘the first Gupta hoard to be scientifically analysed and adequately published.’ 

The Bayānā hoard proved to be a boon to Indology. It contained a large number of new varieties of the known types. Like the Garuḍadhvaja variety of Kācha, the Archer type of Chandragupta II, of the Lion-slayer type of the same ruler etc. The hoard was crucial in assessing Emperor Kumāragupta I as well for it disclosed ‘for the first time as many as five new types of his, — (i) the King and the Queen type, (ii) the Chhatra type, (iii) the Lyrist type, (iv) the Rhinoceros slayer type and the Elephant-rider Lion-slayer type.’ The last Gupta Emperor to be represented in the hoard was Skandagupta. ‘Even though the hoard contained only one coin of Kramāditya (Skandagupta); but it also had a new type of that ruler, the Chhatra type.’ But this uniqueness of the Bayānā hoard was accentuated by other important reasons. There were found even those variety of coins that were ‘so far unknown’ and this astounded Altekar more. To him, the most interesting find was the Chakravikrama type coin of Chandragupta II.

In his own words — ‘We all know that this emperor was a great devotee of Vishnu. But no one had ever thought that he might have issued a coin type, showing himself as a direct recipient of a prasāda from Vishnu, manifesting himself before his royal devotee for that purpose. And yet this is what we visualise on the single coin of the unique Chakravikrama type, for the first time disclosed in this hoard.’ 

The readers might be aware of the fact that ‘the Gupta emperors were first to start the practice of giving the coin legends in beautiful metrical lines.’ The hoard was significant even for this reason as its coins disclosed ‘several new poetic hemistiches.’ It is possible that sadly, due to the avarice of the villagers, some more than 200 coins were lost forever but Altekar was of the view that between the huge number and a remarkable variety of the coins discovered from this hoard, ‘only two types e.g. the Standard and King and Queen on the Couch types of Chandragupta II, (each known so far from a solitary specimen) are missing in it.’ So it is also possible that even though the loss was significant in numbers, but we could have been fortunate just enough in not losing any new unknown varieties.

**§ A Curious Situation —**

To Altekar, it was interesting that such a discovery was made from a site such as Hullanpurā in Bayānā. The reason being, as he explained, the find-spot and even the nearby village was devoid from any obvious historic Gupta relics or any old structures. So it came as a surprise to him that such a treasure was unearthed from a site devoid of any obvious signs suggesting the antiquity of it relevant to the Gupta period. Even the town of Bayānā itself seemed at the time, insignificant with regard to the Gupta antiquity. However, later there were found some Gupta sculptures from this and the nearby regions.

We do know that Bharatpur had yielded some unaccustomed cast coins, punch marked coins belonging to the Janapada period and even coins of the Yaudheya tribe and those of the Kuśāṇa-s. There was also found an inscription belonging to the third-second century BCE. Yet, nothing particular related to the Gupta-s. We do however, get some information regarding medieval name of Bayānā — the town has a mosque which evidently was built by destroying an estwhile Jain temple for ‘on one of the plasters of this building, there is a Sanskrit inscription, dated in Samvat 1100, in praise of a Jain teacher named Maheśvarasūrī, who died in that year.’ This particular inscription yielded an older name Śrīpatha for Bayānā. Another evidence comes from another place in the town called Ushā-mandira, which has ‘a second Sanskrit inscription, about a century earlier’ also referring to the place as Śrīpatha.’

But as Altekar mentioned, these are early medieval records and therefore not very useful to ascertain the Gupta antiquity of Śrīpatha, which now appeared almost five centuries earlier than this record. To Altekar, writing in late 1940s, the name Bayānā itself defied any clear source. But, there are explanations now concerning its name at least. It seems that the region of Bhādānaka or Bhādānaka-deśa with its Apabhramsa rendering Bhayāṇaya probably resulted in its current form Bayānā.

Some towns do exist in the find site’s proximity that have yielded evidence for their relevance to the early Gupta period like the fort of Bijayagadh (Vijaygarh) — two miles southwest of Bayānā and eight miles north-west of Naglā Chhela and Hullanpurā. It has yielded good evidence, like the fragmentary inscription of 300 CE referring to a ‘Mahārāja-Mahāsenāpati’ of the Yaudheya people and another one referring to Yaudheya presence in the region. An inscription of the Varika ruler Viṣṇuvardhana (son of son of Yaśovardhana and grandson of Yaśorāja) — perhaps a noble of Samudragupta — has also been found, dated to 372 CE recording the erection of the Yūpa by Śrī Viṣṇuvardhana at the completion of the Puṇḍarīka sacrifice for the religious merit, fame, prosperity, welfare of himself and the family. Altekar thus mentioned Vijaygarh as a possible centre of administration in the Gupta period.

**§ The Owner —**

We unfortunately, have no idea who the owner of this hoard was. Considering the ancient relevance of the nearby Vijaygarh vis-à-vis Bayānā, it is thus possible that the owner of the hoard was ‘a citizen of Vijaygarh rather than of Śrīpatha, whose antiquity cannot so far be proved to be of the Gupta age.’ The fact that the last Gupta emperor represented in this treasure was Skandagupta, it is possible as per Altekar that this unknown owner probably had ‘buried it in a field of his own at Hullanpurā at the time of the Hūṇa invasion.’ 

Considering the seriousness of the invasion and the ensuing battle that raged between the Hunnic and the Gupta forces, it is possible that the owner in all likelihood, ‘was killed in the disturbances, and so the hoard remained undisturbed till 1946.’ Nevertheless, it surely means that he must have been a man of importance and means.

> ‘It is not unlikely that the anonymous owner of this hoard had
> selected his coins, at least in some cases, not only for their gold
> value, but also for the rarity of their types and varieties and the
> excellence of art showed by them.’
>
> — Altekar, 1954.

**§ Conclusion —**

Thus, the Bayānā hoard turned out to be one of the most sensational numismatic discovery so far made in the history of India. Under the patronage of the Bharatpur ruler, the research headed by Altekar was completed by the year 1949. But the tumultuous period of and post-1947 meant a break in the publishing of the work. However, the Mahārājā decided to proceed forth regardless and the publishing process was started. With funds from the state authorities, it was even decided to get the plates prepared in England and the work was finally published in 1954.

Some coins were eventually donated by the Bharatpur state authorities so that the originals can be seen by the students and interested laymen alike — except some of the coins of the Bayānā hoard that were kept in the Palace Cabinet of Bharatpur, a lot of them were donated to the National Museum, New Delhi, to the Bhārat Kalā Bhavan Sangrahālaya, Banāras (now Vārāṇasī), the Patna Museum, the Prince of Wales Museum (now Chhatrapati Shivāji Mahārāj Vāstu Sangrahālaya), and the Patna Univervsity also received many of the coins. And this is how an extremely important discovery for Indian history was thus saved from being lost to forever.
