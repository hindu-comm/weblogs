We all are very well aware about the sixteen states (*soḷasa
mahājanapada*) of ancient India. Their rise is usually considered to
have taken place in pre-6th century BCE India *i.e.* before the *rise of
Kosala under Mahākosala, father-in-law of Bimbisāra¹* . Some of these
sixteen states have been mentioned in various earlier sources. For
example, Kāmboja, Aṅga, Magadha etc have been referred in the Vedic
literature but it is the Buddhist text- *Aṅguttara Nikāya* which first
enlightens us about this concept of ‘sixteen states’ that were important
enough in those times to be specifically mentioned.

The sixteen *mahājanapada* as per *Aṅguttara Nikāya* were Kāsi, Kosala,
Aṅga, Magadha, Vajji, Malla, Chetiya (Chedi), Vaṁsa (Vatsa), Kuru,
Pañchāla, Machchha (Matsya), Sūrasena, Assaka, Gandhāra, Kamboja.²

As can be expected in the political climate of those times, these states
of varied dominance had varied relationship with each other. Some were
more commanding than the other and with time, the political ambitions of
some of these states had resulted in their aspirations for more. By the
sixth century BCE when the curtain lifts, of the aforementioned states,
four *mahājanapada*–*s* are in the ascendance- Kosala, Vatsa, Avanti and
Magadha. We obviously know that which of these four was to become the
paramount power of India but to know about that journey is just as
fascinating as the outcome. From the political power struggle between
these four states, Magadha emerged as the harbinger of India’s political
destiny for centuries to come.

With the rise of Magadhan monarchy in the period of *Haryaṅka-s* from
sixth century BCE on wards, the relationship of Magadha with another of
the four important states, Avanti gradually became strenuous. The
hostility between these two states forms the topic of this brief
analysis.

**Background**

***Magadha:*** According to the *Mahābhārata* and the *Purāṇas*, the
earliest dynasty of Magadha was of the Bārhadratha kings. The first king
of this dynasty was Bṛihadratha, son of Vasu Chaidyoparichara and the
father of Jarāsandha.³ The dynasty is continued in the *Purāṇas* until
the last of its king, Ripuñjaya. But as Dr. Raychaudhuri puts it, there
is a serious lack of external corroboration regarding this dynasty and
therefore, many scholars are hesitant to take it seriously. Some
scholars agree with the historicity of the Bārhadratha kings and agree
that they ruled in Magadha before the rise of Bimbisāra and his family
but the exact chronology in this period is a bit difficult to ascertain.
The fall of the Bārhadratha dynasty leads to, again as per *Purāṇas* in
the succession of the Pradyotas (the dynasty of king Pradyota) to the
throne of Magadh which were later ousted by Śiśunāga, king of Banāras.
And after the fall of Śaiśunāga kings, emerged Bimbisāra in Magadha.⁴
But, with the corroboration from the Buddhist sources, this information
lacks in cohesiveness. The *Purāṇas*, though otherwise very informative,
are particularly in this regard contradicting themselves, as will be
explained later in this write up.

It is now generally accepted by the scholars that Pradyota-s ruled in
Avanti, not Magadha and that Śiśunāga succeeded the Haryaṅka dyansty
(the dynasty of king Bimbisāra). The Buddhist text *Mahāvaṁsa* informs
us that Bimbisāra was only fifteen years old when he was anointed king
by his own father, whose name is not disclosed by *Mahāvaṁsa* but other
sources mention it as Bhaṭṭiya.⁵ The chronology of various dynasties at
Magadha is therefore considered as: Bārhadratha (probably), followed by
Haryaṅka dynasty, followed by the Śaiśunāga and then came the Nandas.

***Avanti:*** Avantis are not mentioned in Vedic Literature but as per
*Mahābhārata*, Avanti was ruled by the dual monarchs, Vinda and Anuvinda
*who each led an akṣauhinī of troops to Duryodhana’s army*.*⁶* Both
these kings with such huge contribution, not only in numbers but also
with their prowess immensely helped the Kaurava’s army but were slain in
the battle either by Arjun or by Bhīma. The *Purāṇas*, particularly
*Viśṇupurāṇa* and *Agnipurāṇa* mention the matrimonial relations between
the Avantis and the Yadus. It is stated that Vasudeva, son of Śura had
five sisters, one of whom named Rājyādhidevi was married to the king of
Avanti and that the couple had two sons, Vinda and Upavinda (probably
identical to Vinda and Anuvinda of *Mahābhārata*).⁷

![***Avanti***
***Mahājanapada***](https://cestlaviepriya.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/mahajanapadas_c._500_bce.png?w=1000)

Some more information is provided by the *Purāṇas* regarding the state
of Avanti. The *Matsyapurāṇa* tells us that the ruler of this territory
was the powerful Kārttavīryārjuna of the Haihaya dynasty. He had many
sons, one of whom was ruling in Mathura, the other in Surāśṭra and one
son named Jayadhvaja was reigning in Avanti. Jayadhvaja’s son Tālajaṅgha
in turn had many sons as well. The *Purāṇas* also inform us that the
Haihayas formed five main groups namely, Vitihotra, Śāryāta, Bhoja,
Avanti and Kunḍikera who were collectively called Tālajaṅghas. Of these,
Avantis were ruling in Mālwā.⁸ The historicity of the Haihayas is
certain for they have been mentioned even in *Arthaśāstra* and as per
the *Purāṇas*, were responsible for the establishing the capital city of
Māhiśmati. But, the exact chronology of these dynasties is again a bit
muddled because not much information is available after Vinda and
Anuvinda of *Mahābhārata*. Though it is very much possible that
Vitihotras (one of the Tālajaṅghas) were ruling Avanti before the rise
of Pradyota.

***“According to some scholars, the twenty Vitihotras, who are mentioned
in the Purāṇas, as having ruled after the Bhārata War were kings of
Avanti.”***

The Buddhist sources are our further source of information on Avanti. It
is stated that Avanti was divided in two parts-northern part with its
capital at Ujjain and southern with Māhiśmati as its capital (*c*.*f*.
the *Mahābhārata* makes Avanti and Māhiśmati as two separate kingdoms).⁹
*Mahāgovinda Suttāṅta* also makes Māhissati as the capital of Avantis
and mentions its king Vessabhu.¹⁰

**Ascendance of Pradyota**

The *Purāṇas* tell us that a minister named Pulika will kill his master
and then will anoint his son Pradyota as the king. The related verse
mentioned with a loose translation is as follows:

***Bṛhadratheṣv atīteṣu Vitihotreṣv Avantiṣv  
Pulikaḥ svāmīnaṁ hatvā svaputraṁ abhiṣeksyati.***

***When ***Bārhadrathas******, ***the Vitihotra and Avantis passed away,
a minister named Pulika is said to have killed his master and anointed
his own son Pradyota by force.***

The early Pali texts tells us that the Avanti king Canḍa Pradyota
Mahāsena was the contemporary of Bimbisāra. Therefore, Pulika couldn’t
have killed the last of the Bārhadrathas- Ripuñjaya, because the
Buddhist sources place Pradyota as the king of Avanti and not Magadha.
Here comes into play the self contradiction that was mentioned above.
The *Vāyu Purāṇas* tell us that “*Śiśunāga will destroy the prestige of
Pradyotas and will be king*“:

***Ashṭa-triṁśachchhatam bhāvyāḥ  
Prādyotāḥ pañcha te sutāḥ  
Hatvā teshām yaśaḥ kṛitsnaṁ  
Śiśunāga bhavishyati*** ^(***11***)

Now if Śiśunāga was to destroy the Pradyotas then he has to come later
than the first Pradyota *i*.*e*. Canḍa Pradyota Mahāsena or king Canḍa
Pajjota who we know that he was the contemporary of Bimbisāra, the king
of Magadha at that time as per the Pali sources. Another important fact
is that Śiśunāga in the *Purāṇas* has been mentioned as the king of
Banaras but we know that Kāśi did not become a dominion of the Magadha
until king Bimbisāra and his son Ajātaśatru. Therefore, Śaiśunāga
dynasty certainly came after the Haryaṅkas and the Pradyotas (as
mentioned in the Pali sources) was the dynasty of Avanti and not
Magadha. One more important piece of information comes from
*Mālālaṅkāravatthu* that *“Rājagṛiha lost its rank as a royal city from
the time of Śiśunāga.”* This clearly points to the fact that Śiśunāga
came after *the palmy days of Rājagṛiha* which was after the time of
Bimbisāra and Ajātaśatru.¹²

Another very interesting information about the family of Pradyota comes
from *Harśacharita* of Bāṇa. Bāṇa writes: *“Kumārasena, the Pauṇic
prince, younger brother to Pradyota, having an infatuation for stories
about selling human flesh, was slain at the feat (feet?) of Mahākāla by
the Vampire Tālajaṅgha.”* *(*Agrawal, *The* *Deeds* *of* *Harsha)*.
There is an interesting interpretation by Dr. Bhandarkar about the
Tālajaṅgha, his family and the aforementioned incident. As explained
before, there is a strong possibility that Vitihotras (one of the
Tālajaṅgha branch) were ruling in Avanti when the Bṛihadratha empire of
Magadha came to an end. And the king that Puṇika or Puṇaka killed was a
Vitihotra king and then he annointed his son Pradyota as the king of
Avanti. What probably happened in the above mentioned verse was a
possible act of revenge.¹³

> ***“..someone descending from the Tālajaṅgha family who were friends
> of the Vitihotras, in the temple of Mahākāla killed Kumārasena, who
> was son of Puṇaka and younger brother of Pradyota. Folk tradition
> converted this Tālajaṅgha into a vetāla or vampire. In very ancient
> times, human sacrifice was performed in the temple of Mahākāla and
> this gave to Tālajaṅgha and occasion to be successful in his
> conspiracy.”***
>
> **Dr**. **Bhandarkar as cited in V. S. Agrawala’s The Deeds of
> Harsha**

The Buddhist sources make Ujjain as the capital of the *mahājanapada* of
Avanti. The *Purāṇas* describe Pradyota as a powerful monarch who
defeated many of his neighbouring kings – *sa vai pranata sāmantaḥ*. But
some harsh criticism is reserved for him in both kinds of our sources.
The *Purāṇas* describe him as “destitute of good policy
(*nayavarjita*)”¹⁴ and the Buddhist sources like Mahāvagga also say that
he was cruel.¹⁵ All of this explains the epithets like Canḍa and
Mahāsena. It is also revealed that king Pukkusāti or Pushkarasāri of
Gandhāra waged war against Pradyota in which Pradyota was defeated.¹⁶

***Pradyota and Bimbisāra:*** Pradyota was therefore certainly a
formidable king but the relations between him and Bimbisāra seem quite
cordial. When Pradyota got affected by jaundice, Bimbisāra sent his
physician Jīvaka to help him. But the friendly relations here come to an
end and Magadha under various successive dynasties doesn’t rest until
Avanti is brought under its sway.

***Pradyota and Udayana:*** Udayana was an interesting historical
monarch of Vatsa kingdom. He has been the hero of many Sanskrit and Pali
works. From *Dhammapada* and also Bhāsa’s *Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa* and
*Svapnavāsavadattā*, we are told that Udayana, monarch of the Vatsa
kingdom was a very warlike king and had a strong army with many
elephants. This prosperity and wealth of Udayana made Pradyota jealous
and he conceived a plan to capture him. When Udayan was at the frontier
of Vatsa, Pradyota succeeded in trapping him and he was made captive.
But the Vatsa monarch was able to free himself with the help of daughter
of Pradyota, Vāsuladattā or Vāsavadattā and they both eloped and got
married. How much of this romanticized version is true cannot be known
for sure but the fact that this tale with more or less similar story
line has been detailed in varied sources tells us that Pradyota
definitely wanted to conquer Vatsa and somehow Avanti ended up having
matrimonial relations with Vatsarāja.

**Avanti and Ajātaśatru**

The first time relations between Avanti and Magadha turn sour was when
Ajātaśatru was ruling Magadha. The source for this is the Buddhist text
*Majjhima Nikāya* that mentions the discomfort of the Haryaṅka monarch
with Pradyota. It states that Ajātaśatru fortified the capital city
Rājagṛiha as he was afraid about a possible invasion of his territories
by Pradyota.¹⁷ We do not know whether the attack was ever made but there
seems to be another interesting fact explained below, which might have
played an additional role that made Ajātaśatru fortify his capital.

Another way in which Avanti and Ajātaśatru’s relations went downhill was
that Avanti also played a role against Ajātaśatru in the famous Magadha
and Vajji conflict that protracted for many years. Amongst many other
reasons for this long conflict was that Magadha monarch was not fighting
against a mere republic but this republic was a proper confederation of
as many as 36 republics under the leadership of its chief Chetaka.
Chetaka had given his daughters to many kings. He had strong matrimonial
alliances with many *mahājanapadas* like Sindhu-Sauvīra, Vatsa and yes,
Avanti.¹⁸ This fact must have played an important role in the mutual
relations of Avanti and Magadha. But this matter remained unresolved in
the time of Ajātaśatru.

**Avanti and Udāyin**

The conflict of these two states continued in the time of Udāyin, the
successor of Ajātaśatru and Pālaka, successor of Pradyota in Avanti. The
*Pariśishtiparvan* informs us that Avanti was still counted as an enemy
of Udāyin.¹⁹ This is in accordance with whatever has come down to us in
our sources about the relations of Avanti and Magadha in the reign of
Ajātaśatru.

***Pālaka, King of Avanti:*** From the point of view of Magadha, the
ambitions of this state, with the passing of time becoming more and more
aggressive. Aṅga, Vaiśali had already been taken under its sway. The
Vajji conquest was a feather in the cap of the Magadhan monarch. Kosala
was already feeling uneasy with the ensuing events and Kosala after the
reign of Prasenjit, was already on the decline. Avanti was the only
remaining thorn in its way. And from the point of view of Avanti, it was
now alone holding the ground. *Kathāsaritasāgara* tells us that
Udaybhadra or Udāyin had many a times defeated Pālaka, the son and
successor of Pradyota. Vatsa with its capital at Kauśāmbi was now the
only remaining formidable kingdom apart from Avanti but even Vatsa
perished and Pālaka grew in power after his conquest of Kauśāmbi.²⁰ With
the independence of Vatsa gone, the rival kingdoms of Avanti and Magadha
were now face to face with each other.

The *Āvaśyaka sūtra* tells us how Udāyin, who as per Jain sources was a
devout Jain, was killed:

> ***“while he*** ***(Udāyin)**, was listening to the discourse of a
> teacher, with a novice, the latter fell upon him and killed him with
> his concealed dagger. It is stated that this assassin was engaged by
> his political rival, Pālaka*** ***the king of Avanti.”***
>
> ***History and Culture of Indian People, Vol II, The Age of Imperial
> Unity.***

**Śiśunāga** **and Successors of Pālaka**

The *Purāṇas* tell us about the dynasty of the Pradyota-s in which only
four kings succeeded Canḍa Pradyota. They were Pālaka (who has been
mentioned above), Viśākhayūpa, Ajaka (Āryaka) and Nandivardhana. They
ruled for 24, 50, 21, 20 years respectively. The length of the five
kings in total of the Pradyota-s is given as 138 years.

When some more information is related about the Avanti-Magadha conflict,
the Haryaṅka dynasty is gone and Śiśunāga is the king of Magadha. As
stated before, the *Purāṇic* sources tell us that the powerful dynasty
of Pradyota-s would be finished by Śiśunāga. But there seems to be some
ambiguity as to which king of Avanti did Śiśunāga defeat. Was it Ajaka
or the last ruler Nandivardhana that was defeated and Avanti was at last
annexed into Magadha? But some added details are related in the Jain
sources (explained below) that suggest that this was not the end yet.

**Some More Evidence: The Reign of Kākavarṇin**

Kākavarṇin as per the *Purāṇas* or Kālāśoka as per the Buddhist sources,
succeeded Udāyin. The additional information regarding Avanti and
Magadha rule is as mentioned above is provided by the Jain sources. They
relate to us that the kingdom of Avanti was still standing and that
Kākavarṇin beseiged Ujjain during the course of which the king of
Avanti, possibly Ajaka died and the city was captured. Kākavarṇin (who
was later assasinated) also possibly died returning from his victory of
Ujjain.²¹ But here it is important to mention that it is only a
conjecture for we get another story regarding Kākavarṇin and his death
from Dr. Bhandarkar and his interpretation about the death of Kākavarṇin
as mentioned in *Harśacharita* of Bāṇa. In Agrawal’s *The Deeds of
Harsha*, Bhandarkar’s interpretation is given as:

***“Śiśunāga’s son Kākavarṇa, put to an end that foreign occupation and
brought some of the Yavanas (indication is towards some Iranian from the
Achaemenid dynasty of Darius III) to his capital. One of them assembled
a plane for taking and took the king on the same to Nagara or Jalālābād
which was capital of Gandhāra and there put an end to his life.”***

There could be genuine historical information in this short incident
described but with lack of corroboration from any other source, it
remains only one of the many stories about Kākavarṇas death. Some more
information is required before confirming any one of the possibilities.

**Was it Mahāpadmananda?**

If we continue the story about Kālāśoka’s death after returning from
Avanti, then probably due to the assassination of Kālāśoka, conquest of
Avanti remained incomplete and Avanti therefore as per some scholars,
was still standing as independent. The last of its king belonging to the
Pradyota dynasty still ruled for another twenty years during the course
of which the throne of Magadha had now passed to king Mahāpadmananda,
who finally finished off the kingdom of Avanti after securing his
kingdom and annexing other kingdoms first (like his conquest of
Kalinga).²² We know for sure that Avanti formed an important part of the
Nanda empire. The extensive conquests of Mahāpadmananda in every
direction is the reason that he was given the epithet of *Sarva
Kṣatrāṅtaka* or *Mahākṣatrāṅtaka i*.*e*. the exterminator of kings.

**Conclusion**

Almost every ancient source of information regardless of the situation
of a civilization, whether it’s India, Mesopotamia or Egypt had an
established practice of recording events that they considered important
enough to be mentioned. They recorded many of the events and
personalities along with the information which was ancient even to them.
And they did so in their unique fashion and thus it is very normal that
much of very real historical information in these sources is sometimes
mixed with either some embellishments or it is sometimes incomplete and
lacks in proper chronology. Many scholars therefore try to construct the
chronology and other historical data by corroborating various sources.
Like in case of India, ancient records like the *Vedic* literature, the
*Itihāsas*, the *Purāṇas*, the Buddist and Jain sources along with
archaeological evidence (when it is available) are compared with one
another and a common plausible line is taken to make a cohesive account.

This exactly has been applied by various scholars whose interpretation I
have tried to reiterate here regarding the end of an ancient conflict
between such important kingdoms like Avanti and Magadha. This was a very
important stepping stone for the rise of Magadha in ancient India. This
conflict finally came to a conclusion with incorporation of Avanti into
Magadha and this is how the house of Pradyota-s came to its end.
