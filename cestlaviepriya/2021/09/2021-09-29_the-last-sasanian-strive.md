The Last Sasanian Strive

The downfall of the mighty ancient Persia under the Islamic onslaught
was one of the most catastrophic events of history. There seems to be a
popular perception about the ancient Persian civilization that after the
victory of the Arabic forces over the House of Sasan and death of the
Sasanian Emperor Yazdegerd III (***r**.* 632-651 CE), the way was smooth
for the invaders and there were no attempts by the Persians for
retrieving their lost empire. However, this is a fallacy. There were
many bids both from within the empire and outside it to capture the lost
dominions and this post is an attempt to clarify the myth and reiterate
what various historians and scholars have to say in this regard. This
post traces the activities of scions of the House of Sasan outside
Persia *i.e.* in Central Asia and China and the last strive to recapture
their lands and prove their authority.

**Background**

***§*** ***Yazdegerd III: The Last King***

After the successful Syrian expeditions, the even more tempting
expeditions against the Iranian Empire were becoming the focus for the
Arabs. The battle of Dhū-Qār(Dhi Qar), tentatively dated to have been
fought sometime between *c.* 604-611, demonstrated that regular troops
like those of Persians could be defeated under impetuous charges of the
Arabs.^(**1**) The onslaught continued and the two decisive battles –
the battle of Qadisiyyah (637 CE) and the battle of Nihāwand (641 CE)
marked the end of the Sasanian dynasty.^(**2**) The end still might not
have been so imminent had it not been for the death of the emperor
Yazdegerd in 651 CE in Merv.

After the defeat in the the battle of Nihāwand (641 CE), the *king of
kings* was on a mission, from one district to another to seek help and
alliance with many rulers. He was in Persis trying to do the same when
Arabs captured it and he had to flee to the eastern parts. Marking his
way from Kerman and Sīstān to the Xwarāsān (Khurāsan) in *c.* 650, he
had planned to seek the alliance of nobles and the *marzbāns* (margraves
or military governors *i.e.* warden of the marches – in charge of the
border provinces of the Sasanian Empire) as his last line of
defence^(**3**) but that proved to be an uphill task. The hostility of
the heads due to the fear of a challenge to their authority along with
the stubborn and thickheaded attitude of Yazdegerd contributed to this
failure. This might have been due to his age also as he was a young man
of around twenty six years and the inexperience might have contributed
to his attitude.**⁴ **For example – when he went to Sīstān, as per
Balādhurī, he asked for the overdue tribute which miffed its
governor.^(**5**)

After such unsuccessful attempts and rather sad state of affairs, he
reached Xwarāsān where he was apparently accompanied by Farruxzād
(Farrukhzād), the brother of Rustam the commander of Qadisiyya army.
Farruxzād after the death of Rustam had himself became the commander of
the Persian army. Ṯaʿālibī tells us that the ruling Kunārang of Tūs
refused to help them saying that the royal entourage was too much for
him to accommodate and sent him away after giving some gifts
(Pashazanous & Afkande, 2014). The end result was that the visit was
unsuccessful. He now fled to Sogdia’s Farγāna (Farghāna) but returned to
Xwarāsān when the news of the uprising of its people against the Arabs
provided a flicker of hope. Meanwhile, Farruxzād asked the Merv
*marzbān*, Māhōy Sūrī, a member of the Sūrēn family to support the
emperor but Yazdegerd and Māhōy had severe disagreements and soon fell
out.^(**6**) Yazdegerd had also attempted to depose Māhōy and the
bitterness only increased from hereon.

***§*** ***Death of Yazdegerd***

Māhōy allied with the Turkic leader – Nēzak (also called
Tarxān/Tarkhān), the Hephthalite ruler of Bāγdīs (Bādghīs, currently one
of the north-western provinces of Afghānistān bordering Turkmenistān),
against Yazdegerd and provoked him into a battle with the ruler.
Apparently, Yazdegerd had also earned the displeasure of the Turkic
leader due to his behaviour – Nēzak was displeased by the manner in
which the king had received him.**⁷** The outcome unsurprisingly
favoured Nēzak and the emperor lost the battle and his Royal Guard was
annihilated. Yazdegerd took refuge in a mill and was murdered in his
sleep in *c*. 651 by the miller who had provided him refuge.^(**8**)
This was done apparently at the instigation of Māhōy, whose soldiers as
per Ṯaʿālibī, *“found him in the mill and strangled him with a bowstring
and imputed the killing of the Sasanian emperor to the miller”*
(Pashazanous & Afkande, 2014). His corpse was then thrown into the Merv
river where it was found by a Christian priest who then buried him.
Betrayal of Māhōy undoubtedly had resulted in such a miserable end and
unfortunately, in the need of the hour, disunity defined the political
climate of the Sasanian empire.

***“Those subjects still loyal to Yazdegerd, blamed his death on Māhōy,
bestowing upon him and his descendants the epithet x^(w)adāy kušān,
literally ‘king killer’ (Iṣfāhānī 63).”*** ^(***9***)

**Sources**

The sources for the information regarding the relations of the the last
king Yazdegerd and his descendants with the Central Asians and the
Chinese *i.e.* the T’ang Dynasty are varied. The early Islamic authors
like Ṭabarī, Masoudi, Balāḏori and the later Middle Persian sources like
*Zand-e-Bahman Yasn*, the *Bundahishn,* and *Kitâb Futûh al-Buldânand*
are informative in this regard but the Chinese sources provide us with
the much needed details (Pashazanous & Afkande, 2014). The Chinese
sources are one of the earliest in mentioning about Yazdegerd and his
scions.

There are mostly three main literary sources – first is the *Jiu
Tangshu* (舊唐書), or *The Old Book of the T’ang Dynasty* (*c*.
618-907). A first official history of the T’ang dynasty, this was
compiled during the later Jin Period (*c.* 936-946) under the direction
of Liu Xu and Zhang Zhaoyuan. Second is the *Xin Tangshu* (新唐書), or
*The New Book of the Tang Dynasty*, the second official history of the
T’ang dynasty, compiled during the Northern Song period (c. 960– 1126).
Scholars agree that the latter is the more reliable account of the last
Sasanians’ activities and therefore, is used much more than the former
to form a cohesive account.**¹⁰ **Another important source is a text
called *Cefu yuangui* (冊府元龜), or *Prime Tortoise of the Record
Bureau*. This was the largest encyclopedia compiled during the Song
Dynasty (*c*. 960–1279).^(**11**) There is also one text called *“the
Nārseh’s Diary”*. Nārseh was also one of the last Sasanians in China but
the text is considered unreliable by scholars as it is more romantic
than historical in nature.^(**12**) The archaeological sources are not
many but they still provide some much needed information, especially
helping in filling the gaps which the textual sources are not able to
fulfill.

**Embassies to T’ang China**

It has to be pointed out that Yazdegerd had realised the dangers that
were looming over his empire and had sent embassies towards the east –
to China, Sogdia, even to the Khan of the western Turks as early as *c.*
639. As per *Xin Tangshu* and *Cefu yuangui,* in around *c.* 639-40 a
mission was sent under Mo-se-pan (没似半 *i.e.* *marzbān*). The embassy
was sent to gain some help against the Arabs but evidently it was in
vain.^(**13**)

***§*** ***The Second Embassy and Pērōz***

Despite the severe losses after the battle of Nihāwand *c.* 641,
Yazdegerd continued his calls for assistance and sent embassies to
China. His desperation can be seen in the fact that this embassy was
sent despite the refusal of help from the T’ang court in the first
attempt. It is important to note here that as per Masoudi, Yazdegerd had
five children – two sons named Wahrām and Pērōz, and three daughters,
Adrag, Šahrbānu, and Mardāwand. Pērōz and Wahrām and their descendants
were to play a very important role in the Sasanian attempts to regain
their power.

***“The king sent envoys two years in a row, in 647 and 648, to
desperately ‘seek assistance from the Chinese court with the hope to
form a new army.'”¹⁴***

It was during this second embassy that Yazdegerd sent his sons and
daughters (it seems not all of them but some were definitely sent) to
the T’ang controlled Central Asia. This was done not only to get Chinese
help but also to keep imperial family safe and out of the reach of the
Arabs. But stars were not in favour of the Sasanians for the call for
help was again refused by the Chinese Emperor – Taizong (唐太宗) (*r*.
626–649). The sheer distance played significant role in this decision as
the Chinese were hesitant to undertake such long distance military
campaigns (Pashazanous & Afkande, 2014).

**Pērōz** **III**

Born in *c.* 636, Pērōz couldn’t have been more than thirteen years of
age at the time of the second attempt of Yazdegerd to seek Chinese
assistance. Few years after the death of his father, in *c.* 654, Pērōz
(called Pei-Iu-ssu 卑路斯 by the Chinese) again sought to enlist the
Chinese support in the fifth year of the Yonghui reign 永徽 (*c.*
654)^(**15**) *i.e*. during the time of emperor Gaozong (唐高宗) (*r.*
649–683), and again met with disappointment for the same reason that the
father of Gaozong, preceding emperor Taizong had refused – the risk of a
military campaign at such a distance. Meanwhile, Pērōz, who now claimed
himself as the *King of Kings* – the ruler of Persia after the death of
Yazdegerd, found refuge in Tukhāristān (Bactria of the ancient Greeks
and the territory that today comprises parts of Uzbekistān, Tājikistān
and northern Afghānistān) and tried to find some support from the
Sogdian and Hephthalite princes in the region and it seems like he did
get help of the Tocharians in the form of some sort of troop support. As
to the question that why these regions were chosen to sought the
assistance by the scions of the Sasanians, the quote below may shed some
light –

***§*** ***A Short Respite***

***Arabs: ***It is significant to note that two important events
coincided with the period in which Pērōz was trying to restore the lost
glory of the House of Sasan. First related to Arabs and the second to
the Chinese. Arabs though have tried to get to this region in *c.*
653-54 during the Usmān Caliphate, and had crossed the Oxus but nothing
much of importance was achieved there and the vital crossings of the
territory were not secured until *c.* 674, during the reign of the first
Umayyad Caliph Muawiyah I when the Sogdian ruler of Bukhara, Bukhār
Khudāt was defeated by the Arabian forces.**¹⁶ **And, it was not until
*c.* 709-10 that Arabs captured Tukhāristān.**¹⁷ **Therefore, the
region, particularly the southern districts of Oxus and Tukhāristān were
relatively free of the troubles from the Arabs till *c.* 674. This
helped Pērōz to chart out his plans and attempt to recapture the lost
dominions. Tocharians used the moment of respite provided by the Arabs
between the period of *c.* 654-674 and restored Pērōz, at least
theoretically, in his possessions.

***Chinese:*** During the Eastern Han Dynasty (東漢) (*c.* 25-220 CE)
also sometimes called the Later Han Dynasty (後漢), China had made
advances and held some territories in Central Asia. But during the
entire time Sasanians were ruling in Persia, China was going through a
phase of disunity and was busy with the internal discontent due to the
“Warring Dynasties.” Hence, there were no claims made from the Chinese
side on its erstwhile Central Asian possessions. China achieved unity
during the Sui Dynasty (隋朝) (*c.* 589-618 CE), and by the time of the
T’ang Dynasty (唐朝) (*c.* 618-907 CE), China was again asserting its
power in the region.^(**18**) China emerged victorious over the Western
Turks in *c.* 658 and was now in a position to be much more concerned
with the Persian affairs. In *c.* 661, T’ang-s decided to organize the
administration of the territory conquered from the western Turks.**¹⁹
**With this coincided the attempts of Pērōz and it seemed that finally
there was some hope for the Sasanian scion.

***§*** ***Renewed Efforts of Pērōz***

Not getting disheartened with the constant refusals, Pērōz renewed his
efforts and again sent an embassy to the Chinese in *c.* 661-62 and his
voice was heard this time. As mentioned above, China was organizing the
administration of the conquered areas of the Western Turks and decided
to pay heed to the request of the Sasanian to help and assist in
defending his kingdom from the Arabic onslaught. Pērōz was now
recognized as the King of Persia by the Chinese. It seems that this time
around, Pērōz himself went to China and asked for assistance. In
Tukhāristān, the T’ang-s established the city of Tsi-ling or Jilingcheng
疾陵城 as the *Bosi dudufu* 波斯都督府 *i.e*. Persian Military Commander
Prefecture and Pērōz was appointed as its *Dudu* 都督 *i.e.* Military
Commander.^(**20**) Around c. 663-64, as per *Cefu yuangui*, emperor
Gaozong sent Pērōz to Tocharistan as its ruler. It is however important
to note here that the Chinese might have accepted the role of Pērōz and
had given him lofty titles but was Pērōz accepted as the King by the
Persian nobility in exile? Even more telling is the fact that *“the
Zoroastrian communities of Persia and India still employ a calendar
starting with the date of Yazdigird III’s death, ignoring on the
contrary anything concerning Pērōz”* (Compareti, 2003).

And how helpful was this recognition? Some scholars are of the opinion
that it didn’t result in any tangible outcomes. Chinese though helped
Pērōzcement his rule and help him forge a sort of Iranian kingdom in
the region with the city if Ji-ling under him (Pashazanous & Afkande,
2014) but this in reality did nothing more than consecrate already
accomplished facts and an actual aid did not materialize (Clement, 1927;
Frye, 1983). Apart from giving an investiture to Pērōzand a title,
nothing much more was provided. He after all, with the help of the
Tocharians was already in possession of the region. The readers at this
point might be wondering where exactly was this city of Ji-ling?

***§*** ***Locating Ji-ling***

There are two possible answers suggested by the historians for this. It
certainly was not in Persia proper as it was now under the rule of the
Arabs. Earlier scholars like Yule and Chavannes and later scholars like
Daryayee and Harmatta were of the opinion that as proper Persia was not
a possibility, it could have been in the easternmost provinces of the
Sasanian Empire – Sīstān or Sījistān. Hence, Ji-ling was identified with
the town of Zaranj, the capital of Sīstān.**²¹ ** The fact that Zaranj
was independent at this time from the Arabs is sighted in support of
this theory. Some suggest that the location of Sīstān as the possible
area of ‘rule’ of Pērōz would mean that he *was taking advantage of the
weakened Western Turk control south of the Hindu Kush to claim the
kingship of a greatly reduced ‘Persian Empire’ \[Chinese Po-su\]*
(Rezakhani, 2017). But we would also have to consider another fact that
according to the Chinese sources like *Xin Tangshu* and the *Cefu
yuangui,* Pērōzcame to the city Ji-ling in around *c.* 663-64. By this
time, Zaranj (Sīstān) had lost its independence and was now under the
Arabs. It then becomes highly unlikely that Ji-ling could be situated in
Sīstān.**²² **

> ***Even though there were some minor turbulence in Sīstān at that
> time, there is no mention of Pērōz or any foreign power (Chinese or
> Turkic) involved in the Sīstān uprisings in any Islamic or local
> sources. Moreover, the Tang’s involvement in any military operation in

>
> ***– Pashazanous & Afkande, 2014.***

And as it has already been established that after the victory of the
T’ang China over the western Turks in *c.* 658, the region was under the
Chinese and it was therefore given to Pērōzto rule over. It then
becomes a strong possibility that the city of Ji-ling was actually
situated in Tukhāristān and not in Sīstān. The fact that according to
Balāḏori, Pērōzmarried a noble Turkic woman also helps us to identify
the city of Ji-ling in Tukhāristān.^(**23**)

***§*** ***Return to China***

During this period, Pērōzhad kept relations with the Chinese and had
even sent envoys to Chang’an, the T’ang capital in *c.* 667 and *c.*
671.**²⁴ **As has been briefly mentioned above, Tukhāristān succumbed to
the Arabic pressure and the Chinese sources inform us that
Pērōzreturned to China in *c.* 673-74, possibly after his defeat by the
Arabs. He seems to have gone once again to the west but again returned
to China in June *c.* 675. This was to be his last journey. On both the
occasions he was warmly received by the T’ang emperor Gaozong and was
bestowed with the honourary title of *“Awe-inspiring General of the Left
(Flank) Guards”* (*zuŏ wēi wèi jiāng jūn* 左威 卫将军). This title was
among sixteen such titles he had received.**²⁵ **The title was
comparable to the Roman Praetorians whose duty was to protect the
emperor and were allowed to stay in the imperial palace.^(**26**)

***§*** ***The Persian ‘Temple’***

The Chinese sources inform us that Pērōz managed to get permission from
Gaozong to build a “Persian Temple” called *Bosi-si* (波斯寺 ) in
Chang’an, the T’ang capital.**²⁷ **There is a good deal of controversy
around the nature of this ‘temple’. Some believed that the ‘temple’ was
predictably a Mazdean establishment and therefore was a proper Persian
temple but many scholars now believe that actually it was a Christian
*i.e.* a Nestorian temple.**²⁸ **This admittedly sounds strange that why
would a Sasanian attempt to build a Nestorian temple? But the answer may
seem far more convincing than one might imagine and gives us the hint
for the last Sasanian rulers’ interest in Christianity.**²⁹ **It is also
interesting to note that scholars are now of the opinion that Pērōz’s
wife was most likely a Christian.**³⁰ **The rather strong connections
between the late Sasanian rulers like Khusrow II Parvēz (*r*. 590-628
CE) and Christians are also noteworthy. By the time of its late rulers,
the Sasanian support to the Nestorians increased especially as a
counteract to the Byzantians.^(**31**) China on the other hand, also
seems to have gotten introduced to Christianity very early.

***“… it was discovered that another Persian, a certain Aluoben
(阿罗本), introduced Christianity into China and built the first church
in Chang’an in 635.” ³² ***

***§*** ***Statue of Pērōz***

Pērōz died around *c.* 677-78 and was succeeded by his son Narseh. It is
assumed by scholars that he was buried possibly in Chang’an.**³³ **Near
Xi’an in the mausoleum of Gaozong and his wife, Qiangling, there stands
a beheaded statue in the front and the inscription on the back pedestal
tells us that the statue belongs to Pērōz. The statue is part of the
original sixty-four other statues of foreigners at the entrance of the
mausoleum, sixty one of those statues now survive. The inscription says:

**右驍衛大將軍兼波斯都督波斯王卑路斯**

**Yòu xiāowèi dà jiàngjūn jiān bōsī dūdū bōsī wáng bēilùsī**

***“Pērōz, king of Persia, Grand general of the right courageous guard
and commander in chief of Persia.”***^(***34***)

Interestingly, this is not the only statue with an inscription of a
Persian in the mausoleum. There is one other statue, also headless
which has the following inscription:

**波斯大首領南昧**

***Bosi da Shouling Nanmei – “Nanmei, the Grand Head of
Persia.”***^(***35***)

It is necessary to point out that both the inscriptions can no longer be
read on the statues. The inscriptions had eroded before 1958 but the
1980 article of Chen Guocan in which he studied the statues of the
foreigners at the mausoleum, he used varied Chinese sources and
historical texts and confirmed the details of the inscriptions that has
been mentioned in those texts.**³⁶ **As to why these statues are
headless and when exactly they lost the heads, it is uncertain as of
now. There were found some parts of two statue’s heads. A head was also
found curiously with curly hair and a Parthian moustache.^(**37**)

![](https://cestlaviepriya.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/peroz-statue.jpg?w=220)

**(*A statue of Peroz is known to stand among the statues of “61 foreign
officials”* i*n Qianling Mausoleum* *(WikiMedia Commons)***

> ***This unique depiction is not completely similar to the faces of
> Sasanian kings represented on rock-cut reliefs and coins. It is also
> possible to imagine that this head may belong to a Sasanian prince who
> was deeply influenced by Parthian fashion and was a ruler in the
> eastern parts of Sasanian territory.***
>
> **Pashazanous and Sangari (2018),*The Last Sasanians in Chinese
> Literary Sources***

The clothing of a certain statue was also found different from other
statues which had typical long garment of the Chinese official type,
suggesting that particular one to be of Pērōz, but it is nothing more
than a suggestion at this point.

***§*** ***Identity of Nanmei***

It has been suggested by some scholars like Daryayee that this Nanmei
could have been Narseh, son of Pērōz who as aforementioned, succeeded
him and stayed in Tukhāristān and China for a long time.**³⁸ **Another
possibility is that this Nanmei might be some other Persian noble that
might have come along with Pērōz and the statue might be of him. But,
there is another curious claim for the statue of Nanmei; a funerary
stele recovered near Luo-yang (the eastern capital of the T’ang dynasty)
provides us the details of the career of one Aluohan. Scholars consider
that Alouhan might be the Chinese version of the Persian name Wahrāmwho
was, as readers might remember from being mentioned above, was also the
name of the other son of Yazdegerd and brother of Pērōz.

**Wahrāmor Alouhan**

The inscription on the stele describes Alouhan as a Persian who was
‘highly esteemed’ by the Chinese emperor Gaozong. This also makes him a
contemporary of Pērōz. Alouhan as per the Chinese sources was apparently
sent to Byzantium as a Chinese envoy, the reason of which scholars
suggest could probably be to conclude an alliance between the T’ang and
Byzantine empires^(**39**) and he is said to have constructed (or got
constructed) an important building in China.^(**40**)

The inscription stored in the Imperial Museum of Uyeno in Japan gives us
more insight into this interesting Persian Alouhan who is called *the
most illustrious person of the whole tribe*.^(**41**) He is called the
*“Great Persian Chieftain, the General and Commander of the Right Wings
of the Imperial Army of Tang* \[*i.e.* China\] with the title of *Grand
Duke of Chin-chʻêng-chün \[in Kan-su\] and the Rank of Shang-chu-kuo
\[*上柱國, *i.e.* lit. *the first-class cornerstone of the Empire\]”*.
The inscription continues to tell us that Gaozong had heard of his
‘illustrious deeds’ and got so impressed by him that he personally sent
for him to come to his palace and when he did, he was made the
Generalissimo. He was made responsible for defending the Northern Gate
*i.e.* the northern region of China and they sent him as the imperial
envoy to the tribes of Tibet, Ephraim, and other countries.^(**42**)
Ephraim is suggested by scholars to have been a place near the Eastern
Roman Empire on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.^(**43**) It also
appears from the inscriptions that he had made an attempt to reinstate
the Sasanians and retake *Ērānšahr*. But it seems certain that Alouhan’s
role was more on the diplomatic side than military.

The Middle Persian text called *Zand ī Wahman Yasn* gives information
which gives confirmation for the identification of the Alouhan of the
Chinese sources with Wahrām. The book has a story called
*“Wahrām-ī-Warȷā̌wand”* that says – *“and when that king was thirty
years old … having gathered innumerable soldiers and banners, of China
and India holding banners … the kingdom is entrusted to him.”*^(**44**)
Interesting to note is that Bīrūnī, in his book, *Ketāb taḥqīq mā
le’l-Hend*, says that the Zoroastrians of Sogdiana recognized the Punjab
along with Hindu Kush as India. India in this context might refer to the
Hindu Kush region and probably some areas of Punjab and as per some
scholars even to Tukhāristān.^(**45**)

It is however certain that the plans and the attempts didn’t prove to be
successful but it also conclusively proves that constant attempts were
being made by the last of the Sasanians.

**Narseh**

Narseh/ Narsieh, as mentioned above was the son of Pērōz and succeeded
him after the death of his father in around *c.* 678. He is called
Nie-nie-che -涅涅师 (one of the many versions of the name) by the
Chinese and was a hostage in the Chang’an court of the T’angs at the
time of Pērōz’s death. A year later in *c.* 679, The Chinese general
*“Péi Xíng Jiăn* (裴行 俭), *responsible for subduing the western Turkic
khan āshĭnà dōuzhī* (阿史那都支), *who was allied with the Tibetans and
Kashgarians,”***⁴⁶ **took Narseh to Tukhāristān and crowned him there.
Apparently, Narseh was taken there on the pretext of eventually helping
him reconquer his empire and install him on the throne of Persia.**⁴⁷
**The Turkic Khan despite maintaining seemingly good relations with the
T’ang court was actually trying to regain his lost possessions in
Central Asia by allying with the Tibetans^(**48**) and the Chinese
decided to subdue him at this point. After the defeat of the Khan by the
Chinese in Tukhāristān, the promised march to take over *Ērānšahr* and
reinstate Narseh was abandoned who was now left in Tukhāristān^(**49**)
by the Chinese. It seems like there never was any intention of the
Chinese to reinstate Narseh in his throne. They only seem to have used
him as an excuse in order to finally gain an upper hand over the Tukic
Khan.

Narseh ultimately stayed there for twenty years and kept on fighting and
resisting the Arabs in the region, exhausting his men and resources. But
not much seemed to have been achieved and finally he ended his stay in
Tukhāristān, quite reluctantly one must say, and came back to China in
*c.* 709. It is very clear that Narseh returned only when there was no
other measure left to attempt in Central Asia as the Arabs were
ascending in the region.

Some confusion seems emerge from the Chinese sources. The *Jiu
Tangshu*(舊唐書), or*The Old Book of the T’ang Dynasty makes* Pērōz to
have taken the the *c.* 678-79 journey but the confusion is cleared in
*Xin Tangshu*(新唐書), or*The New Book of the Tang Dynasty that
categorically mentions the Persian as Narseh to have been active in*
Tukhāristān after *c.* 679. After he reached China in *c.* 709, he was
awarded with the title of *Zuoweiwu jiangjun* 左威衛將軍 (General of the
Left Awesome Guard)^(**50**) or *zuŏ wēi wèi jiāng jūn* *i.e.* General
of the Left Majestic Guard.^(**51**) He died of an illness soon after
that.

**Jū Luó or Khusrow**

Narseh was not the last Sasanian scion in China. As mentioned above,
Alouhan or Wahrāmhad also been very active, albeit diplomatically. But
Wahrāmalso passed away in *c.* 710. After that the Chinese sources
mention one Jū Luó (俱羅) which is considered by scholars to be the
Chinese version of the name Khusrow.^(**52**) He seemed to have
*continued his father’s mission.^(**53**)* Arabic sources corroborate
this information. Ṭabarī mentions one son of Yazderednamed Khusrow who
as per him fought against the Arabs in the army of the Turkic Khan in
Transoxiana around *c.* 728-29. Now we know that the year gap is too
much for him to be a son of Yazdegerd. Therefore, it looks like Khusrow
was the grandson of last actual Sasanian emperor. Khosrow is also told
to have visited China in *c.* 730-31.

**Other Embassies**

It would be wrong to say that the efforts by the Sasanian descendants
ceased by this time. The Chinese sources mention that many embassies
were sent by the Persians to the T’ang court, some as late as *c.* 772!
These embassies are suggested by scholars to have been sent mostly from
the Māzandarān or Tukhāristan.^(**54**)

***Cefu yuangui (冊府元龜) gives us information about Kings of Persia
who sent embassies to the Tang court at Chang’an from 723 to 772.⁵⁵***

Two names mentioned as the Persian Kings in the *Cefu yuangui* then
become important in this regard. One is **Bó Qiāng Huó
(勃善活)^(**56**) who is identified as Pušang, the grandson of Narseh.
This would mean that a direct descendant of the last Persian *king of
kings* was even now trying to reclaim his throne. He stayed in
Tukhāristan and continued to fight with the Arabs. Other name mentioned
is Mù Shānuò (穆沙诺) who apparently came to the T’ang court either in
*c.* 726 or *c.* 731. He was even awarded with rank of a General and a
Guardian of the Emperor.^(**57**) As mentioned above, the embassies came
till as late as *c.* 772 but not much is known of the Persian activities
to regain the throne after this period. The sources are silent on this
topic from hereon.

The role of China in the aftermath of the Arabic victory over the
Sasanian Empire became very important. The T’ang dynasty extended the
Chinese boundary which the country never realized again – the Pamirs had
been crossed and modern territory of the northern Afghanistan had been
reached^(**58**) and brought under their dominion. China had established
the *Protectorate to Pacify the West* or the *Anxi Protectorate* and had
made commanders for the region. A specific Chinese Persia expeditionary
force was also established by the T’ang court to reestablish their
hegemony in the Central Asian territories^(**59**) and when they
couldn’t directly capture the region, they followed the policy of
supporting the Central Asian rebellions against the Muslims^(**60**) but
the fate was sealed in around *c.* 751 when Battle of Talas confirmed
the Islamic rule of East Iran/Khurasan.^(**61**) This explains why it
became difficult for the scions of the House of Sasan to continue their
resistance from Central Asia and why the Chinese help didn’t result in
actual victories.

***§*** ***In Japan***

The Persian nobility seems to have gone in various directions to protect
themselves from the Arab attacks and even to continue their endevours to
capture the lost empire. Some evidence even emerges from Japan. The
Japanese historical source, *Nihon Shoki* (*Chronicles of Japan*), one
of the earliest of its kind, completed in *c.* 720, mentions that in
*c*. 654, many people arrived there from Tokhārā**⁶² **undoubtedly a
name for Tukhāristan. It also gives the name of one Dārā, a very Persian
name indeed and says that in *c*. 660 he went back to his country but
left his wife there in Japan and made a promise that he would return and
work for the emperor again.^(**63**)

**Policy Change in China**

The various Persian princes and Kings who stayed in China were not
alone. Many of them had an entourage with them and some even had their
families. It was not just the royal family but the population of the
Persians and Arabs in general in China was a lot and they had come with
various goals. Some wanted political asylum and assistance and some like
Nestorians came for the propagation of their religion and many were
there totrade**⁶⁴ **and they were indeed welcomed in the country but
this seems to have changed after a powerful general named An Lushan
安禄山 in *c.* 756 who was Iranian on the side of his father and of
Sogdian-Turkic ancestry, seized Lou-yang, the eastern capital of the
T’ang empire and established his own dynasty named the Great Yan (*Dà
Yān*大燕).^(**65**) He is probably the greatest and most terrible rebel
in the Chinese history. It was only six years later in *c.* 672 that the
T’ang could abolish the detested rule from Lou-yang.

The T’ang rule was restored and as a result of the edicts issued by the
minister Li Mi (*c.* 722-789), financial support to the Iranian nobles
living in Chang’an got very much restricted^(**66**) and this coupled
with the Arabic victory in Tukhāristān certainly affected the chances of
the Sasanian princes which by each passing year were becoming slim
anyway. Though, this doesn’t mean that the Iranians didn’t stay in China
anymore – there were plenty. A Middle Persian-Chinese bilingual
inscription, on a gravestone near town of Sian in Shensi province of
western China records the death of a princess of Suren family in *c.*
872/874.^(**67**) This is a good example for how late the Persian
nobility in exile was in China even after the hopes of getting any
actual political gain for the erstwhile Sasanian Empire were not great.

**Conclusion**

This article and the views of various scholars and historians mentioned
in it points to one very important conclusion – that the Sasanian
descendants didn’t accept the results after the fateful battle of
Nihāwand (*c.* 641). They didn’t sit idle and in fact, right from the
last *king of kings* Yazdegerd to the last of the known scions of the
dynasty, they tried to reclaim their dominions and their throne. China
evidently played an extremely fateful role in their strives. It becomes
also very important to note that during this entire period, due to its
peculiar geographical position and political climate of the time, the
Central Asia, particularly the region of Tukhāristan was the prime seat
of struggle for the Persian princes and kings.

Notwithstanding the unsuccessful nature of these endevours, in the
entire century of struggle (*c.* 641-731), it becomes amply clear from
the study that numerous attempts were made to achieve the ultimate goal
of reinvigorating the glory of the House of Sasan and negates the
perception that the dynasty just vanished after the death of Yazdegerd
in Merv.
