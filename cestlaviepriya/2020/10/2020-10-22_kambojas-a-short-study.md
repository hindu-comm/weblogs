India throughout her civilizational history always had an enormous
geographical limit and in the ancient times with various tribes and
kingdoms, her boundaries went way beyond what we now know of today’s
Republic of India. Many of these ancient tribes were situated in the
upper reaches of the land and one of those tribes – the Kāmbojas is the
topic of this short study.

**The Territory**

The Kāmbojas were situated in the north western part of ancient India.
In the entire corpus of ancient Indian literature, they are mostly
mentioned along with the Gāndhāra and had the place called Rājapura
(mentioned in *Mahābhārata*) as its capital which has been identified
with Rājouri near Punchh in Jammu and Kashmir. Rājapura was also
mentioned by Hiuen Tsang. There have been many interpretations as to the
extent of the this tribe. Some scholars suggest that they reached as far
as the Pamir mountain range and the Balkha – Kafiristan region while
others state their situation to the area around the Hindu Kush, covering
probably the territory from Kabul and Kandahar to Rājapura in the
south-east of Punchh. Some scholars also ascribe them the regions as far
as Tibet (Interesting to note that the Nepalis describe Tibet as
Kāmbojadesh and their language as Kāmbojabhasha) while some limit their
territory in Sindh and make Dvārakā its capital, though the Dvārakā and
Sindh theory seems to have less support than the others. As one can see,
the exact boundaries are still not conclusive. But, it is clear that in
any of these situations, the Kāmbojas for sure covered a huge territory.

There is also some controversy among the historians as to whether these
people originally belonged to the Iranian stock or if they were proper
Indo-Aryans.

**The *Brāhmaṇa***

The very first time that we learn about the word Kāmboja is from the
Vedic literature. The *Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa* of the *Sāma Veda* mentions a
teacher named Kāmboja Aupamanyava i.e. the son of Upamanyu.¹ It suggests
that the man probably hailed from that part of the territory.

The Vedic texts mention a man named Ānandaja who received his Vedic
knowledge from two teachers. One was Śāmba, son of Śārkarākśa and the
other teacher was Kāmboja Aupamanyava. According to Dr. B. C. Law, it is
interesting that Ānandaja had two teachers, which he thinks as quite
odd. In his *Tribes of Ancient India,* he suggests that Ānandaja seemed
to have approached Kāmboja later for he “perhaps was distinguished for
special pre-eminence in Vedic learning.” And this fact as per Law, helps
us to determine that the Kāmbojas were Vedic people distinguished in
their knowledge. A sage by the name of Upamanyu has been mentioned in
the *Ṛg Veda* and Law considers that he could very well be the father of
the sage mentioned above. This connection is supported by other scholars
as well. He points to the fact that both these teachers had a common
Vedic teacher of their own, a sage named Madragāra Śaungāyaṇi. His name
indicates that he belonged to the tribe of Madra and this helps us to
conclude that the people of Kāmboja had close connections with Madra
people. His interpretation thus supports the theory of Kāmbojas being of
Indo-Arya stock. Some supporters of the Indo-Arya theory also suggest
that the Kāmbojas later moved to the north-west of Indus and thus became
the Kambujiyas mentioned in the Old Persian Inscriptions.²

**Yāska’s *Nirukta***

Kāmbojas are then mentioned in Yāska’s *Nirukta* (II, 8)³ which suggest
that they spoke a Vedic tongue which was different from what was
considered standard in the Madhyadeśa proper. This could either mean
that they had kept some of the early Vedic terms alive in their tongue
which was lost later in the language of the Madhyadeśa or it could just
mean that they were indeed of Iranian origin and thus spoke a language
infused with the impressions of both the regions.⁴ But the literature
from this time does seem to give quite a lot of importance to the
*Udichya* dialect i.e. the northern dialect on account of its purity.

**“*The superiority of Brāhmaṇās of the north is indicated by the
victory of one of their spokesman over a Kuru-Pañchāla Brāḥmaṇa in a
debate.*“**^(*5*)

It is therefore not a surprise that Takśaśilā, the famous north western
city of ancient India later went on to become a center of Vedic learning
and we already know about the importance of Kashmir in the Hindu
philosophy. Then it does seem likely that Yāska probably meant that a
more pure dialect of Vedic Sanskrit was used in the region of the
Kāmbojas. Yāska in his interpretation gave a slightly unconventional
meaning to the the word Kāmboja connecting it with both *Kāma i.e.*
pleasure and *Kambala i.e.* blanket, and derived its meaning as Kāmaniya
Bhoja – “the enjoyers of pleasant things.”⁶. This interpretation may not
seem that much out of place when we consider evidence from the
*Mahābhārata*.

**Evidence by Pāṇini**

As Pāṇini came from the north-west of the Indian sub-continent, he was
quite aware of the customs of the Kāmbojas. We are told by him in his
***Mayūravyaṃśakādigaṇa*** that they were shaven headed. From Harivaṃśa,
we are again told that the Śaka or Scythians had half of their head
shorn while the Yavanas and the Kāmbojas had their entire head shorn.
The Pāradas (inhabitants of Paradene, today’s Balochistan) “wear their
hair free” while the Pahlavs (Persians) have beards.

**The *Mahābhārata***

We get to know from the *Mahābhārata* that when Yudhiṣṭhira conducted
the Rājasuya *yajna*, he was presented with various gifts by the King of
Kāmboja.

> ***“the Kamboja king presented to Yudhishthira ‘many of the best kinds
> of skins, woolen blankets, blankets made of the fur of animals living
> in the burrows in the earth, and also of cats – all inlaid with the
> threads of gold.’ (Sabhaparvan, Chap 51, 3); and again, ‘The King of
> Kamboja sent to him hundreds and thousands of black, dark and red
> skins of the deer called Kadali and also blankets (Kambala) of
> excellent texture.'(Sabhaparvan Chap 49, 19).”***
>
> **Dr. B. C. Law, Tribes in Ancient India**

Now after considering this passage, the connection that Yāska made about
the Kāmbojas with blankets *i.e. Kambala* does seem to resonate. As
mentioned above, it is the *Mahābhārata* that informs us about the
connection of Kāmbojas with Rājapura. We are told that Karṇa actually
went there to conduct war against them.

**“*Karṇa Rājapuram gatvā Kāmboja nirjitāstvayā*“**^(**7**)

*Mahābhārata* also mentions Kāmboja as forming a part of *Uttarāpatha*
in the following verse:

**“*Uttarāpathajanamānaḥ kîrtayiśyāmi tan api  
Yauna Kāmboja Gāndhāraḥ Kirātā Barbaraiḥ saha*“**^(**8**)

As mentioned in this verse, Kāmboja formed a part of the northern route
in the period of *Mahābhārata* along with Gāndhāra & Kirāta. Pāṇini in
his *Sūtras* has also mentioned the Kāmboja. But, another important
figure that had a connection with Kāmboja in the *Mahābhārata* was
Arjuna. The *Sabhāparva* of *Mahābhārata* mentions an expedition of
Arjuna, a victory journey in which he conquered various other tribes of
the north-west along with the Kāmboja. The conquered tribes included
Daradas & Kāmboja. Afterwards Arjun went even further to north and
conquered other tribes like Loha, Param-Kāmboja, Ṛṣikas and
Param-Ṛṣikas. One reading of Arjun’s expedition seems to suggest that
Kāmboja resided in the region of Hindu Kush and others deduce from these
verses that their home could very well be the Badakhshan and the Pamirs.
Later on in the fifth book of *Mahābhārata* – the *Udyoga* *Parva*,
Kāmbojas are again mentioned along with Śaka and Pahlava.

This famous tribe also took part in the Kurukṣetra war from the Kuru
side and Duryodhana especially boasted about this. They had very brave
soldiers and their king Sudakṣiṇa, the one who had eyes of a coppery hue
rendered great service to the Kuru side. Dr. Law in his *Tribes of
Ancient India* tells us that the Kāmboja army formed *the van of the
Kauravas forces along with the home forces of the Pauravas themselves.*
But despite his prowess, he was defeated and killed by Arjuna in a duel.
The verses in a very eloquent composition pay homage to the bravery and
prowess of the slain king.

***“Dr. Roychaudhuri points out that the western boundaries of their
territory must have reached Kafiristan in which district, the three
distinct tribes, namely, Caumojee, Camoze and Camoje reminds us of the
Kāmboja.”***^(***9***)

*Mahābhārata* ascribes a system of monarchy to the Kāmbojas.¹⁰ Though we
see that they seemed to have changed their system of governance later
on, which we discuss in the following paragraphs in this post. But,
there is another very interesting point. The *Mahābhārata* has some
scathing remarks about the people from the north west. The Kāmboja king
is mentioned as a *mleccha* along with some other people like Āndhra,
Pulinda, Śaka, Yavana, Ābhiras etc. There seems to be a certain pattern
to this. The tribes outside the pale of *Madhyadeśa* (Ganga-Yamuna Doab)
had some caustic remarks reserved for them. But one wonders what exactly
changed from the Vedic times to the period of *Mahābhārata*. This
unfavourable attitude is conspicuous by its absence in earlier sources.
And this scornful commentary is not limited to only *Mahābhārata*. It
continues to be evident in later sources as well. A hint on what may
have happened can be found in the great epic itself. The later sections
like Śānti parvan and the Anuśāsana parvan mention a very interesting
point. They say that their country was *“overrun by barbarous hordes, so
that the ancient Kṣatriya population was overwhelmed.”* And later in
these *parvas* they are degraded to the rank of Śudras *“for want of
Brāhmaṇas in their country”*. But who attacked them remains a mystery. A
lot therefore remains to be deciphered.

**The Buddhist Evidence &** **The Maurya Period**

The *Aṅguttara Nikāya* mentions Kāmboja as one of the sixteen
Mahājanapadas. This proves that in the pre-6th century B. C. period,
Kāmbojas were still counted amongst the prominent ruling states of
India. The scathing remarks that we discussed above about these people
from the *Mahābhārata* are very much present in the *Jātaka* tales as
well and people of this tribe are discussed quite derisively and more
than once.

![***Kāmboja (north-west) as one of the 16 Mahājanapadas (WikiMedia
Commons)***](https://cestlaviepriya.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/mahajanapadas_c._500_bce.png?w=1000)

*Bhūridatta Jātaka* has this to say about the Kāmbojas:

***Kītā paṭaṅgā uragā ca bhekā  
hantvā kimiṁ sujjhati makkhikā ca,  
eti hi dhammā anariyarupā  
Kambojakānaṁ vitathā bahunnan.***^(***11***)

***Those men are counted pure who only kill  
Frogs, worms, bees, snakes or insects as they will,–  
These are your savage customs which I hate,–  
Such as Kamboja hordes might emulate.***^(***12***)

Hiuen Tsang also ascribes such savage customs to the people of Rājapura
and explains their appearance as very “coarse and plain”, their
dispositions as “rude” and “violent” and also that “they do not belong
to India proper but are inferior people of frontier stock.” He describes
them as barbarians.¹³

In *Sāsanavaṁsa*, we are told about a king named Sirīhaṃsya who
conquered the city of Ratanpura. It is told that he came from Kāmboja.
He was apprehensive about the increasing power of the Buddhist monks and
the possibility of their intervention in the secular affairs. He through
his army conducted a great slaughter of the monks and their disciples
(number told of the killed is around 3,000).

Kautilya in his ***Arthaśāstra***, mentions their non-monarchical form
of government which was not the case in the time of *Mahābhārata*. He
explains the two types of ‘corporations’ and divides them between
*Vārtāśāstropajivin i*.*e*. where government is functioned by those who
practice agriculture, trade, cattle breeding and fighting (wielding
weapons) while the other form is *Rājśabdopajivin i*.*e*. “states in
which the government is carried on by men who lived by the title of
king.”¹⁴ Kāmboja and Saurāṣtra are mentioned as examples of the former –
the *Kshatriyaśreṇi* or a corporation of warriors. An interesting
feature of this kind of government according to the *Arthaśāstra* was
that every single man was to acquire military training which helps us to
conclude that their’s was a citizen army.

Aśoka in his V and XIII Rock Edict mentions Kāmboja as an autonomous
tribe. Scholars agree that during the Mauryan times, particularly during
the reign of Aśoka, Kāmboja was part of the Mauryan Empire but enjoyed a
considerable degree of independence. i.e. it was an autonomous vassal
state.

**Horses of Kamboja**

Throughout its history, Kāmboja was famous for its horses. Bāṇa in his
*Harshacharita* points to the royal horses of Empire of Harsha. The
royal stables had king’s favourite horses which came from the
north-western regions of Vanāyu, Āraṭṭa, Kāmboja, Sindh and Persia. The
fine breed of horses from Kāmboja *(Kambojaka Aśvara)* are mentioned
many a times in *Jātaka* and other Buddhist and Brāhmanical literature
as well.¹⁵ There is reference to Kāmboja as habitat of quality
horses-*assānaṃ āyatanaṃ*. Even Kālidasa has described the beauty of the
their horses. His *Raghuvaṁśa* says that the prowess of the king Raghu
was such that after defeating the Hūṇas, when Raghu met the Kāmbojas,
they bowed down to him *“just as their walnut trees were bent down on
account of Raghu’s elephants being tied to them.”* They also paid a huge
tribute to the king which included many fine quality horses. Dr. Law, a
major source for this blogpost also mentions the *Uttarādhyayana Sūtra,*
a Jain text which furnishes great qualities to the Kāmboja horses like
their speed and their unflinching behaviour regarding noises. Law also
tells us from the Buddhist evidence (*Aṭṭhakathā* on the *Kunāla
Jātaka*) about how Kāmbojas used to capture these horses from the
forests. They apparently used aquatic plants smeared with honey to tempt
these horses in a enclosed space.

The *Sabhāparvan* of *Mahābhārata* also gives us information about the
Kāmboja horses:

> ***“..we read that the king of Kāmboja presented to Yudhiṣṭhir three
> hundred horse of vareigated colours, speckled like the partridge and
> having fine noses like the śuka bird. In the great battle of
> Kurukṣetra, the fast and powerful horses of Kāmboja were of the utmost
> service.”***
>
> **Dr. B. C. Law, Tribes in Ancient India**

**Conclusion**

The territory that currently encompasses the ancient Kāmboja though now
might be a different world altogether but it was for a long time, an
integral part of Indian civilization and it signifies how far the sphere
of influence of ancient India went and how far our ancestral culture
blossomed.
