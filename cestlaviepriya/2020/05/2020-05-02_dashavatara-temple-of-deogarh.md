This is a very short post about this beautiful temple which deserves a
lot more visitors than what it usually gets. The Dashavatara Temple
located in Deogarh, some 125 km from Jhansi is one of the very few
temples from Gupta Era that survived the Islamic onslaught on the
medieval India. Though it doesn’t have the grandeur of the later temples
of the south of India, it still holds its place as a fine example of
stone temple architecture.

Built by the end of fifth or early sixth century, the temple is
dedicated to Bhagwan Vishnu in all his avatars. But, as is usual with
Hindu temples, there are also images of other gods and godesses like
Shiva-Parvati, Indra etc.

Its one of the earliest Panchyatana temple in north India. The Temple
has various scenes etched in stone about Ramayana and Mahabharata and
also scenes from Puranas. It also has images etched of other avataras
because of which it gets the name Dashavatara Temple.

All I hope by writing this, is for some more people to visit this serene
site in the valley of Betwa to appreciate the beauty of its sculptures,
the architecture and the sheer history of ancient India.
