In Search of Pāṭaliputra

It is always surreal to remember a time when a lot of what we now know about ancient Indian history, particularly political history once belonged to the realm of obscure. We can even be accused of taking the information we possess for granted. To think when the empires of Magadha were not general knowledge, when magnificence of the imperial Pāṭaliputra was buried with its ruins – outlandish indeed. Yet, those times were as real as we live in today. But one might ask how we all came to learn what we know today? Where was the start made? This post is about one such significant event. Here, we will try to learn about the sequence of events that led to the confirmation of the identification of Paṭnā with Pāṭaliputra.

**§** **Background**

Significant period in this regard was late eighteenth century CE. Unfortunately, India at the time was getting trapped in the vortex of colonialism. As the East India Company went on annexing territories, it was in the need of officials to govern and administer. There arose a need of learning the languages of India to handle the legal matters. These languages in context of India of those times were primarily two – Sanskrit and Persian.

At the time, the Governor General of India was Warren Hastings, the first one to hold the position. He believed that if the British administrators were to govern successfully; they must learn the languages and customs of India and work within the existing institutions of the country (Keay as cited in Tremblay, 2014: 37). The company was a new power in the sub-continent and it was prudent for them to work within the established structure of India till the time they were strong enough to establish their own institutions. With regard to the Hindus, this meant the Company’s dependence on Brāhmins, the custodians of scriptures. This was not an ideal situation for the colonists who wanted complete control on the jurisprudence of the territories they had annexed. (Keay as cited in Tremblay, 2014: 37). Therefore, as can be expected from a colonial power, the motive was to reduce their dependence on Indians in this regard.

**§** **William Jones & the Asiatic Society of Bengal**

However, some officials with scholarly disposition and highly inquisitive minds were also spending every spare minute they could find to delve deeply and beyond the requirement of their job in various other texts of these languages, in turn getting influenced from the culture they discovered. They were also guided by a strong impulse to find confirmation of what they had learnt about India from the classical sources.

Amongst such officials was an English lawyer named William Jones (1746-1794), who came to India in 1783 as a Judge in the Supreme Court of Calcutta (Tremblay, 2014: 36). Jones by this time already had some significant achievements to his credit – in his capacity as an accomplished linguist, he had already published a Persian Grammar in 1771 to help the East India Company employees learn Persian (Tremblay, 2014: 36). As a philologist and a Fellow of the Royal Society, Jones had also encouraged other European scholars to translate Persian manuscripts for intellectual and cultural enrichment (Cannon as cited in Tremblay, 2014: 36).

Jones while sailing to India, already had an exhaustive list of subjects he was interested in (App, 2009: 2). But the information that the English had on pre-Islamic past of the Indian subcontinent was meagre at best. Jones saw Sanskrit as means of discovering that uncharted history for the Europeans, as well as offering a new and difficult challenge because very few Europeans had ever studied this language. Thus began his fascination with Sanskrit (Tremblay, 2014: 37) and he started his learning from Hindu teachers. This jourmey of his learning is also very interesting but to delve into that is not a task for this post.

The result was the Asiatic Society of Bengal, modeled after the Royal Society and dedicated to the study of history and natural history of the subcontinent (Tremblay, 2014: 36-37). The goals of the Society were –

… investigate whatever is rare in the stupendous fabric of nature, correct the geography of Asia, … trace the annals and traditions of the nations who have peopled or desolated it; … examine their methods in arithmetic and geometry, in trigonometry, mensuration, mechanics, optics, astronomy, and general physics; … morality, grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic; … medicine, anatomy and chemistry …researches into their agriculture, manufacture and trade … music, architecture and poetry. If it be asked what are the intended objects of our enquiry within the spacious limits, we answer Man and Nature; whatever is performed by the one or produced by the other (Mukherjee as cited in Tremblay, 2014: 37).

**§** **Understanding the Motives**

Before proceeding further, we will briefly touch upon an important point regarding Jones and influence of his own religion i.e. Christianity on his scholarship. App mentions on the authority of scholars like Lincoln that even though he (Lincoln) detected a “contradictory” attitude in Jones towards the Hebrew Bible, he maintained that Jones had “since childhood been convinced of the inspired, inerrant nature of Scripture” and that “the ultimate goal toward which he organized his lectures was ‘scientific’ validation of the Genesis account” (Lincoln as cited in App, 2009: 3). Therefore, his researches in the ‘orient’ were an attempt to find humanity’s primeval religion before the deluge (App, 2009: 9) in the hallowed tradition of prisca theologia, ancient theology (App, 2009: 9). And that his projects were not primarily linguistic or ethnological but theological i.e. inspired by an analogous theological and historical outlook (App, 2009: 9).

He and scholar officials like him were still severely castigated by his own countrymen. Starting roughly from the period of 1810s, the English opinion on and in India was dominated by an extreme Evangelical and Utilitarian ideology due to which by the 1830s, scholars like William Jones, James Princep etc. were considered nothing but a bunch of ‘misguided men’ who suffered from a ‘romantic fascination of the East’ and were even called as ‘Brahmanicalised’ Orientalist – words which were specifically used for criticism of their work (Mukherjee, 1968: 111; Tremblay, 2014: 43). However, this topic deserves a separate post of its own and without dwelling on it any further, we will again bring our attention towards the topic at hand.

**§** **The Breakthrough**

It seems like despite his interests, Jones was not that keen on learning Sanskrit in the first half of the year of his arrival (App, 2009: 9). But his interest was piqued by a Persian translation of an old Sanskrit text, the Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (App, 2009: 9) which had been mentioned by Jones’s friend Nathaniel Brassey Halhed (1751–1830), in his introduction to A Code of Gentoo Laws of 1776.

As per App, this version of the Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha may well have been Jones’s first taste of Indian philosophy through Persian sources, and though he was aware that “Persian translations from the Shanscrit \[sic\] are so defective” (Cannon as cited by App, 2009: 10) he was immediately thirsty for more. And this started his studies in and analysis of Sanskrit in course of which he delivered many lectures in the Asiatic Society. Then in 1793, Jones delivered a very interesting discourse, his tenth one. He had stumbled on a breakthrough on Indian chronology (Keay, 2001/1981: 35). In his own words –

‘The jurisprudence of the Hindus and Arabs being the field I have chosen for my regular toil, you cannot expect that I should greatly enlarge your collection of historical knowledge; but I may be able to offer you some occasional tribute, and I cannot help mentioning a discovery which accident threw my way.’

As the title of the post suggests, this breakthrough was the confirmation of the identification of the city of Paṭnā with the imperial Pāṭaliputra. However, the question that first needs to be tackled with is why this connection was no longer a general knowledge? And how this fact was lost in the sands of time, thus needing a confirmation?

**§** **The Decline of Pāṭaliputra**

Pāṭaliputra’s development from a small village settlement to being the capital of many Indian empires is fascinating in itself and deserves a separate study; it would suffice here to say that from a fort being constructed under orders of the Haryaṅka ruler – Ajātaśatru of Magadha (r. 492 – 460 BCE), Pāṭaliputra emerged as the capital of the kingdom in place of the earlier capital city of Rājagriha under Udayī (r. 460– 444 BCE), son and successor of Ajātaśatru. Pāṭaliputra was also known by other names like Kusumpura (as mentioned in the Vāyu Purāṇa) meaning a “city of flowers”. Other names were mere synonyms of the same name Puśpapura or Kusumadhvaja mentioned in some other literary works (Patil, 1963: 373). Patil states that the modern name Fulwāri Sharif of a small hamlet near Paṭnā is a survival of this ancient name (Patil, 1963: 373). Gārgī Saṁhitā even mentions it as Padmavatī during the time of the Nanda-s (Patil, 1963: 373).

By the time of the Maurya-s the name Pāṭaliputra had become the most commonly used. Megasthenes, who arrived in Magadha at the court of Chandragupta Maurya as an ambassador from Seleucucs Nikator gave a vivid description of the city, which he called as Palibothra, a Greek rendition of the Sanskrit Pāṭaliputra. Information from Megasthenes was to prove extremely helpful when attempts were made to locate Pāṭaliputra in the modern times. Interesting to note that the city had already been surrounded by what Patil calls ‘a halo of antiquity’ in Megasthenes’ time, though it was hardly 200 years old then for he ascribed its origin to a divine founder Heracles (to be identified either by Balarāma or Kṛṣṇa), under whom the superhuman beings were commissioned to build its palaces and buildings (Patil, 1963: 374).

> **(Patil, 1963: 374)**

However, when Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), the famous Chinese Buddhist monk and traveler visited Pāṭaliputra in \~ 635 CE, he found that the city had been long deserted with its ruins still standing and occupying an area neatly 70 li or 12 miles in extent – a small town of hardly a thousand houses (Patil, 1963: 376). And apparently not much had changed during the Pāla period as well. According to Patil, very little of Pāla remains were discovered at Paṭnā vis-à-vis other sites in the region. Even the name Pāṭaliputra seems to no longer be in common use. As per some Nālandā seals that were discovered, the small town or village which may have continued to exist at the site (Patil, 1963: 377) was seemingly called Śrīnagara or Nagara, which represented the ancient Pāṭaliputra in the Pāla period (Patil, 1963: 377).

As for the name Paṭnā, the first historical reference of this name comes from 1541 CE. Tārīkh-e-Sher-Shāhī, the Muslim Chronicle of Sher Shah’s reign, says that Sher Shah built a fort at Paṭnā on the bank of the Gangā at a cost of five lakhs of rupees (Patil, 1963: 377). Though, at this moment we cannot be sure exactly when this new name came into vogue due to paucity of any reliable historical source (Patil, 1963: 377). As Patil mentions, none of the early Muslim Chronicles of the 13th-15th centuries CE make any reference to Paṭnā, while prominently mentioning other noted towns of Bihār Sharīf, Māner etc suggesting that Paṭnā at the time, was not significant enough to find a place in the chronicles (Patil, 1963: 377). We can however, reasonably assume that some time before mid-sixteenth century, Paṭnā came to be the name of the place (Patil, 1963: 377). Why this particular name Paṭnā could be anyone’s guess. But Patil points to an interesting probability –

“It seems up to the 12th century A. D. or so the name Śrīnagara or Nagara had been in use; but since its population or importance had further dwindled badly, the name Nagara, which in Sanskrit means a large town, was no longer regarded as appropriate. It may, therefore, have been designated as Paṭṭana, i. e., literally a smaller town, from which probably the name Patna is derived in a corrupted form (Patil, 1963: 377).”

Though we would not go into details of the development of Paṭnā from this time onwards but to summarize, after becoming an important political centre during mid-sixteenth century, the town then began to grow during the Mughal period rapidly, becoming the headquarters of the Governor of Bihār (Patil, 1963: 378). It also grew as a centre of trade and commerce early by the 17th century. It was reputed to be “the largest town in Bengal and most famous for trade” (Patil, 1963: 377) and was also mentioned in Āin-i-Akbarī. Even the English opened a factory here in 1657 (Patil, 1963: 378). While Paṭnā had become a reputable centre by now, the ancient names seems to have passed into oblivion, at least for the common populace, except for some Jain references. It is noteworthy that some Jain image inscriptions were found at Paṭnā which do mention the name Pāṭaliputra as late as 1791 CE (Patil, 1963:378) suggesting that the name had not been completely forgotten and even survived in local tradition.

It is also important to note that any ancient city, no matter how significant it might have been, is more likely to survive vagaries of time if its importance transcends political needs. It is much more likely to stay relevant also in case of it being of religious significance. As Pāṭaliputra was mostly of political importance, it’s relevance was dependent on it being the capital of the empires and when it continued to be non-relevant in this regard for a continuing period of time, it started to decline and only came to its own in the form of Paṭnā when it was again made relevant by becoming a political centre and consequently, a commercial one.

**§** **Identifying Palibothra**

As mentioned before, the Greek writings had descriptions of a majestic capital city of the lands of Prasii named Palibothra. This had made many Europeans curious for its identification (Patil, 1963: 378). Megasthenes had mentioned the city’s location at the junction of the rivers Ganges and Erannoboas (Keay, 2001/1981: 35; Stoneman, 2019: 165). He had also given account of its ruler Sandracottus but there was a glitch; where Palibothra was, which river Erranaboas was supposed to be, and who Sandracottus was, all remained mysterious (Keay, 2001/1981: 35). Despite efforts, the difficulty in locating Erranaboas was the biggest hurdle because no river now joined the Gangā at Paṭnā.

Today we know that this Erranaboas referred to the river Son but this identification was not generally known then. Now the Son joins the Gangā some 30 km to the west, and a much smaller river, the Punpun, also joins it from the south, 20 km to the east. Even if the original course of the Punpun is unclear, the Son was a major artery leading from Madhya Pradesh to the Gangā which itself now runs further to the north than its ancient course: in antiquity the city of Pāṭaliputra was on its southern bank (Stoneman, 2019: 165).

“That the Greek Palibothra should be the Indian Pāṭaliputra is a conclusion which, in the present day, would appeal to be natural and sound enough; but this was not so till the end of the last century. The identification was still regarded as open to doubt and attempts were made to locate the site variously at Allāhābād, Rājmahal near the junction of the Kosi river or at Bhāgalpur (Patil, 1963: 378).”

There were many claims – Major James Rennell in his Memoirs of a Map of Hindostan (1783) maintained that Palibothra should be identified with Kannauj – far west of Paṭnā (Mukherjee, 1968: 105). For him there were many arguments working in its favour – like Palibothra, Kannauj also was situated at the confluence of two rivers; even its latitude of 27° seems to have been in confirmation of what Ptolemy had given to Palibothra (Mukherjee, 1968: 105).

However, Rennel did notice that Pliny’s itinerary put Palibothra near the modern Paṭnā but he still preferred Kanauj as there was no other proof that there was an ancient city near Paṭnā (Mukherjee, 1968: 105). But by 1788, he was in the doubt of this location. He had discovered that the local tradition in Paṭnā maintained that there had been an old city called Patalpoother (Mukherjee, 1968: 105). This interesting nugget opened a completely different possibility. And the fact that the local tradition had remembered the existence of an old city suggests that even though the ancient city declined a long time ago, its memory, albeit a faded one had lived on. In the third edition of his Memoirs of a Map of Hindostan (1793), he finally suggested the site of Palibothra near Paṭnā (Patil, 1963: 378).

Rennel stated the following –

“Late enquiries made on the spot, here, however, brought out this interesting discovery, that a very large city, which anciently stood on or very near the site of Patna was named Patalpoother (Patliputra, according to Sir William Jones). This name agrees so nearly with Palibothra and the intelligence altogether furnishes such positive kind of proof that my former conjectures respecting Canoje must all fall to the ground ’’ (Patil, 1963: 378) … and that the river Soane whose confluence with the Ganges is now at Moneal 22 miles above Patna once joined it under the walls of Patelpoother (Mukherjee, 1968: 105).”

But this identification could not find acceptance (Patil, 1963: 378). Despite his revelation that the Son river, once might have joined the Ganges at Patna, though it had since taken up a course much further east, something which he had learned from the local tradition itself; the question still lingered – how could the Son river be the Erranaboas, especially when, Megasthenes had mentioned the Son as a quite separate river (Megasthenese mentions the rivers Erannoboas and Sonus separately)? (Keay, 2001/1981: 35).

The French geographer d’Anville wrote the first ancient geography of India taking the classical Greek writings as its source. In it he identified Palibothra with modern Allāhābād (Prayāga) (Mukherjee, 1968: 105; Keay, 2001/1981: 35) at the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna (Yamunā) suggesting that the Erranaboas must be the Jumnā. Robertson, one of the three great British historians of the time agreed with d’Anville and thought that Rennel was wrong (Mukherjee, 1968: 105).

But William Jones was to put something new to the table of this debate. He already was aware of the problem of the identification of Palibothra and the elusive Erranaboas. This conundrum must have been on Jones’s mind as he waded through the Sanskrit literature (Keay, 2001/1981: 35). Finally, in a happy accident, Jones stumbled on something seemingly minute, yet significant and the efforts that he had put in learning Sanskrit bore fruit in an unexpected manner. He found the name of a river called Hiraṇyabāhu meaning the golden armed in the Sanskrit texts. This immediately made him realized that Erranaboas could easily be a Greek attempt at Hiraṇyabāhu and that Erranaboas was the Son after all. And as its conclusion, if the Erranaboas was the Son then Palibothra must be identified with Pāṭaliputra, the modern Paṭnā (Keay, 2001/1981: 35).

“Combined with the fact, established by James Rennell in the 1770s that the Son had once joined the Ganges much further east, the identification of the site was assured, and, incidentally, provided testimony to the generally accurate recording by Megasthenes and other Greeks of Indian toponyms.” (Stoneman, 2019: 165).

Thus, Jones in his address to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1793 laid stress on the identification of Greek Palibothra with the Pāṭaliputra of Indian traditions and that it was located near Paṭnā, (Patil, 1963: 378). But we already have noted that Major Rennel was the first one to claim this identification in 1788 and had even cited Jones as authority for it (Jones had explained the actual Sanskrit name Pāṭaliputra for the Patalpoother that Rennel had learnt from local tradition) but Jones seems to have totally ignored Rennel’s contribution (Mukherjee, 1968: 106). Mukherjee points out that we cannot be sure whether Rennel only asked Jones to correct the spelling or received the information about Pāṭaliputra from him. Jones knew in 1788 that Paṭnā was once called Pāṭaliputra and in 1793 he had new evidence to establish this fact (Mukherjee, 1968: 106) in the form of the connexion of the Hiraṇyabāhu and the Erranaboas. It indeed was a discovery which accident threw his way as Jones himself remarked.

Despite this breakthrough, the actual find of the physical ruins of this ancient city had to wait many more years. It was not enough for some to have only a literary confirmation, so they continued to deny this identification. Francis Buchanan had tried to find Pāṭaliputra / Palibothra near Paṭnā in the early nineteenth century but, says Buchanan “none even of the most learned of the natives could give any clue as to its whereabouts (Patil, 1963: 378). Patil mentions that Buchanan was the first to carry out a regular survey of Paṭnā for its ancient ruins and was aware that Pāṭaliputra was its ancient name but he found himself unsuccessful in locating it. He says in his writings, “Pataliputra has no great resemblance to Palibolhra” of the Greeks (Patil, 1963: 379). He therefore considered Palibothra to be a different city from Pāṭaliputra of the local tradition, which he believed, like Wilford, to be situated near Rājmahal.

“It was only after the accounts of the travels of the two Chinese pilgrims Fa Hien and Hiuen Tsang, were published it became somewhat clear to these European scholars that the lost city of Palibothra was really the Pāṭaliputra of Indian tradition and was situated at and near modern Paṭnā (Patil, 1963: 379).”

**§** **Identifying Sandracottus**

Intimately connected with this identification was also the identity of Sandracottus, the king of Prasii, creator of a vast empire described by Megasthenes. Jones had tried but could not find a king with this name and he was never to find it either as this name was a Greek corruption. Jones continued his search nonetheless. In an obscure political tragedy he found what purported to be the story of Candragupta; he was described as a usurper who chose Pāṭaliputra as his capital and received foreign ambassadors there. But it was not something very sudden like the identification of the Hiraṇyabāhu with the Erranaboas. Through Bhāgavata Purāṇa, one if the 18 great Purāṇa-s and Purāṇārthaprakāśa of Paṇdita Rādhākānta, Jones was already aware of a Candragupta, ‘an adventurer prince of India’ (Mukherjee, 1968: 107) and he also had recently learnt about Kathāsaritasāgara of Somadeva that mentioned Candragupta.

What confirmed the identification as alluded to before, was the 18^(th) century drama Candrābhiṣekha by Bāṇeśvara Bhaṭṭācārya (Mukherjee, 1968: 107). Citrasena, Mahārājā of Burdwān was the patron of this poet and the play had been produced at this king’s court describing intrigues of the famous Cāṇakya and Śakaṭāra in usurping the throne from the Nanda-s in favour of Candragupta Maurya (Mukherjee, 1968: 107). According to Mukherjee, the play seems to have been heavily inspired by the Bṛhatkathā tradition. Jones could easily see that the name Candragupta was the source behind the Greek corruption Sandracottus and that the story told about Candragupta matched rather perfectly with that of the classical sources.

The later discovery of an alternative spelling for Sandracottus as Sandraguptos confirmed it even more (Keay, 2001/1981: 36). But now, Jones was tempted to have a proper date for this king. He again found help from the classical sources – 

“…before sending Megasthenes, Seleucus Nicator had himself visited, or rather invaded, India. He had been beaten back but his adversary, even then, had been Sandracottus, whose dominion was already established right across northern India. Seleucus returned west and was known to have reached Babylon in 312 BC. So Sandracottus must have ascended the throne before this date, but after Alexander’s visit – somewhere between, say, 325 BC and 313 BC. Thus, to within a decade, one event in India’s ancient history had been given a date.” (Keay, 2001/1981: 36-37)

Jones concluded – 

“Chandragupta who was a military adventurer, became like Sandrocottas, the sovereign of Upper Hindostan, actually fixed the seat of his empire at Pataliputra, where he received ambassadors from foreign princes and was no other than that very Sandrocottas who concluded a treaty with Seleucus Nikator.” (Mukherjee, 1968: 107)

But again, it has to be noted that Jones was not the only one to attempt identification for Sandracottus. Alexander Dow in his History of Hindostan had identified him with one Sinsarchund, a Hindu king, who according to Firishtā ruled in Kanauj. But as Mukherjee points out, Firishtā’s garbled version of the late medieval Hindu traditions were no guide to Indian history (Mukherjee, 1968: 105). In fact, like in case of Pāṭaliputra, this problem had already been solved before Jones by Joseph de Guignes almost twenty years back. In 1769, one Maridas Pillai (Poulle), chief interpreter to the Supreme Council of Pondicherry had sent his work titled Bāgavadam, a French translation of Bhāgavata Purāṇa to M. Bertin, Minister and Secretary of State (Mukherjee, 1968: 105). In 1772, de Guignes wrote a note on this. Mukherjee mentions that Pillai’s translation work must have been very lose because his transcription of Sanskrit names was in the manner of their pronunciation in Tamiḷ. In the Paurāṇic king list, the name of Candragupta appeared as Sandragouten (Mukherjee, 1968: 105-106). This fixed the identity of Megasthenes’ and other classical sources’ Sandracottus with Candragupta i.e. Sandragouten of Bāgavadam.

“Working from the date of Alexander’s invasion, which he took as 328 BC, de Guignes came to the conclusion that Sandragouten succeeded to the throne in 303 BC. This date he thought synchronized with the Paurāṇic king list if the date of Paricchiton (Parīkṣit) is given as 1051 BC, which date he reached by working backwards from Ghaznavid invasion in A. D. 975 (Mukherjee, 1968: 105-106).”

Therefore an attempt had already been made which was at least quite accurate in case of name of the kings even though the accession date missed a mark. But was Jones aware of this early breakthrough of de Guignes? He surely did not mention it in his address to the Asiatic Society. We do know that he was very much aware of his work and had earlier used his date to determine the birthdate of Buddha as per the Hindu chronology,(Mukherjee, 1968: 105-106) albeit wrongly. But the real problem according to Mukherjee was the reputation of de Guignes who had established himself as an expert on China and therefore, his work on Indian chronology had been largely ignored; even his note on Bāgavadam was considered unreliable (Mukherjee, 1968: 107). And as his article had been published twenty years back, Mukherjee continues, we cannot be sure whether this article was available in Calcutta at the time of Jones and even if he had read it while in England, it is unlikely that he would have remembered the details after such a long time (Mukherjee, 1968: 107).

According to Mukherjee, it thus seems that even though de Guignes was the first to confirm the identification of Sandrocottas with Candragupta, Jones arrived at his conclusion independently. Jones’ conclusion was a fixed possible period for the accession of Candragupta to the throne of Magadha between 325-313 BC (Allan as cited in Tremblay, 2014: 37-38) – the very first event in the subcontinent’s recorded history to be provided with a Western date (Tremblay, 2014: 37-38). This also provided a template, as Mukherjee mentions, for future attempts at fixing the dates for events in Indian history like the birth of Buddha, which was also dated by working backwards from the approxiamte date of Candragupta’s accession. Jones and the likes of him helped provide a foundation for the linguistic and literary studies of India in the western world and drew attention of the world to the Indian historical traditions, and help evolve a foundation of a methodology –

“…reading Brāhmi inscriptions, the study of the ruins and the identification of names and places and persons, like the identification of Palibothra and Sandrocottas. The methodology was summed up by William Chambers: he suggested that Indian history should be reconstructed by ‘comparing names and great events recorded by them \[Indians\] with those interspersed in the memories of the other nations and by calling in the assistance of ancient monuments and coins, and inscriptions as occasions shall offer (Mukherjee, 1968: 110-111).”

A lot more was to be unearthed during the course of the nineteenth century – actual ruins of ancient Pāṭaliputra and James Princep’s famous deciphering of the ancient Brāhmi script etc. but that would be discussed in a future post. However, it is important to note that Rennel, de Guignes, and even Jones found the confirmations for their puzzles in the Indian tradition itself. True that the magnificence of ancient Pāṭaliputra was not commonly known anymore but local tradition had remembered the existence of an ancient city along with the fact that the river Son which now had shifted twenty miles to the west, once flowed much near the modern Paṭnā; and this information helped Rennel in his assertions. Or the facts that Sanskrit dramas like Candrābhiṣekha were being produced as late as the eighteenth century by Hindu poets under the patronage of Hindu kings that ultimately helped in the identification of Sandrocottas with the great Candragupta Maurya. In the process, they were taught and significantly helped by many Indians.

**§** **Conclusion**

However, as important as these researches into Indian traditions were, they have always been double-edged swords in the sense that even though they’ve definitely helped in dissemination of the many obscure facts and information, there’s always has been a legitimate concern regarding motives of these researches and also of this knowledge being taken and understood detached from its context. Anyhow, this is a discussion for another day. One of the most remarkable contributions from the work of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and such researches was the comparative approach of these officials-scholars towards understanding the history of India for corroboration of important information, especially the method of using the classical sources which were not known in India at the time. Unfortunately, these scholars soon were caught in the crosshairs of a strongly emerging rival faction. Before being ridiculed by their own countrymen (by the likes of James Mill) and their work undermined by the later Evangelical-Utilitarian faction amongst the English, Jones and scholars like him did much important work in establishing foundations for studies in Indology.
