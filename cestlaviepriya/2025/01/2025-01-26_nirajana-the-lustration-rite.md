Nīrājana — The Lustration Rite

One whose army consists of soldiers, horses and elephants in a jolly mood, who shines with the lustre of glittering weapons, is free from all unnatural mental dispositions and appears dreadful to the hosts of his enemies, will soon conquer the whole earth.

— Śāstrī, 1946: **Bṛhatsaṃhitā**: Adh. XLIV. ŚI. 1-6

The ancients across the world were well aware of the difference between gaining prosperity and sustaining it. The efforts both of these required involved not only economic, political, and social measures but equally religious ones for unlike the modern world, the separation of the former aspects with the latter was anachronistic to the ancient times. And that is why; there were various rituals, ceremonies and festivals to worship the gods for gaining and sustaining that prosperity, even imploring them when needed to ward off the evil eye, both as a precautionary measure but also if there were portents indicating the untoward. Ancient India was no exception and had various ceremonies for the same.

**§ Background **

Some religious ceremonies required active participation of the sovereign, for example the famous yajña-s like the Aśvamedha, Rājasūya etc. already known to the readers. But there were other festivals and rites which had significant involvement of an Indian king, especially in the ancient times. Reading about them can give us a glimpse into various religious rituals that an ancient Indian king was a part of other than the aforementioned great yajña-s. Unless specifically mentioned by ancient littérateurs or foreign travelers, the relatively rare description of any particular personal information on how any of our great emperors must have celebrated these festivals and conducted their religious rituals makes the description of these royal religious ceremonies quite important with regard to our ancient past for they give us a glimpse to imagine how the kings of the great dynasties like the Maurya-s or the Gupta-s and many others that came after them performed such rites. We can thus, as if be part of the festivals while reading about such specifications. In this post, I will be considering one of such significant ceremonies conducted and celebrated with grandeur in our past — namely, the Nīrājana.

**§ Importance**

In today’s times, these can seem like just another of those myriad of rituals that our ancestors conducted, especially to those who are skeptic regarding the existence of the concept of evil eye and or of the abhicāraḥ practises.^(**1**) But, those who believe in these concepts can well understand the seriousness of and the danger from these malevolent acts and how very real they must have been to an ancient mind just as they are to those who believe in them today. An example of the efficacy of these acts for those in times can be seen from the fact that the great Kauṭilya had a separate section in his Arthaśāstra suggesting the use of people acquainted with such knowledge regarding warding off the danger from demons.^(**2**) In addition to this, the Kāmandakīya Nītisāra praises Cāṇakya (Kauṭilya) for “his magical powers that resembled in potency and in fury the thunder-bolt itself — avi(bhi)cāravajram — and through which he ‘eradicated’ the Nanda-s and ‘brought the entire earth under the thorough control of Chandragupta, the foremost of sovereigns” (Dutt, 1896: 2-3).^(**3**) In light of these references, it is easily understandable as to why the ceremonies and ritual encantations that warded off malevolence and brought health and prosperity to the realm were considered so important and why some of them became so grand in their entirety. 

**— Nīrājana: Definition**

The word Nīrājana is from the verb stem nī-rāj (\>nis + √rāj-) + primary suffix ana (Patyal, 1993: 327) i.e. to cause to illuminate or to shine upon, as √rāj also means to shine along with to rule. Thus, the nīrājana ceremony means to illuminate like fire, driving back the evil and thus causing radiance or good fortune. In his commentary, scholar Gaṇapati Śāstrī explained Nīrājana as a propitiating rite for increasing the strength and pacifying the evil forces:

śāntyudakapuṣpādinā satkāro duritaśāntaye balavṛddhaye ca kriyamāṇaḥ (Kapadia, 1963: 33).

The rite of Nīrājana involved lustration by either waving a lamp (dīpam) around the image of a deity, or lustration with enchanted water or flowers, leaves etc. usually with the accompaniment of mantra-s, singing of metrical compositions and other music, even dances in some elaborate temple ceremonies. As can be seen from this short description, the ritual in some form or the other is daily followed in temples, in the homes of the entire general Hindu populace across the country. This is usually synonymous with a shorter form called the āratī (Saṃskṛta — ārātrikā) or dīpa-ārādhanā conducted in Hindu household and temples. However, the name Nīrājana is usually not used outside the priestly ritual lexicon.

In its both shorter and elaborate form, the ceremony (of illumination) when primarily related to lustration of a deity’s image had already been either alluded to or described in detail in various important religious texts of various Hindu traditions by the classical and early medieval period. For example, many Purāṇa-s include the nīrājana in their description of various form of veneration of a deity’s image. The Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava Āgama texts also describe this ritual of lustration by waving the dīpaka around the deity’s image and even describe the ceremony in detail. In many Purāņa-s, Āgama and Tantra texts we get multiple descriptions where Nīrājana refers to an important ceremony that included waving of lamps before the image or idol of a deity with detailed ritual procedures (Kapadiya, 1963: 42-43; Patyal, 1993: 331-332).^(**4**)

— The Objective

However, the readers must be thinking why this religious ceremony is particularly chosen to be described in this post. The reason is that from the evidence available, it seems that this ceremony was originally both a military and (public) religious ceremony done primarily to ward off certain ill effects on the kings, men (warriors), on human beings in general or on animals like horses and elephants etc. (Patyal, 1993; 327) for their importance in a pre-modern Indian army. Thus, the aim of this post is to discuss this royal-military version of this ceremony and not the other important aspect of veneration and worship of a deity’s image.

The prominence of this military purpose and significant involvement of the king in the ceremony makes it useful for our topic at hand. 

**§ Early Sources** **: Mentions**

— **The Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa**

Curiously, this ceremony is conspicuous by its absence in the early Vedic literature. Historically, the first actual mention of the ritual waving of the lamp to ward off evil and for prosperity comes from the late Vedic texts like the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa — pariśiṣṭa, literally meaning remaining — the supplementary texts, an appendix to the core Vedic texts; pariśiṣṭa to the Atharvaveda are collectively numbered 72. The Nīrājana lustration ceremony is named Hastyaśvānām Nīrājanam / Hastinīrājanam in this Pariśiṣṭa. It is mentioned regarding elephants and horses in the chapter named Rājakarmasāṁvatsarīyam (A P. 17, 18, and 18b), and in the chapter Védilakṣaṇam (A P. 24. 1. 2). An important part of the Védilakṣaṇam is to observe and derive omens from the colours of the sacrificial fire, especially when burnt-offerings are put into the sacred fire for the changing colours of the fire indicate prognostic features (Patyal, 1993: 330).

> Amongst other occasions mentioned when this ritual is to be observed,
> it is noted to be also performed at the outset of a military
> expedition (yātrodyāna).
>
> (Patyal, 1993: 330)

— The Pariśiṣṭa also states the role of the king and his purohita (cf. A P. Saṁbhāralakṣaṇam 21. 6. 7) (Patyal, 1993: 329). One extremely important point noted in the Pariśiṣṭa is that these ceremonies were only to be performed by an Atharvavedin Purohita (Paippalāda and Śaunaka Śākhā) who can redress the portents or else there can be serious repercussions (AP Rāṣṭrasaṁvargaḥ 2. 2. 1 ff; 2. 3. 5 ff; 2. 4. 1 ff; Rājaprathamābhiṣékaḥ 3. 3. 6) (Patyal, 1993: 329).

In another fascinating instance, it also uses the term ārātrikam for the ritual (AP. 7.1.1-7.1.13). It suggests conducting this ceremony in the night in which a lamp (dīpam) is waved around the king three times along with the mantra-s to ward off the evil eye, for the welfare of the kingdom, cattle and the Brāhmins (svastyastu nṛparāṣṭrāya svastigobrahmaṇāya ca AP 7.1.9). The ritual in its entirety is done to increase the king’s power and strength so that he never experiences any calamity. The text mentions the story behind the ritual related to god Indra when he was afflicted with insomnia due to the abhicāra karma done by the purohita of the Dānava-s. The ritual was invented by Bṛhaspati Atharvan in order to protect Indra.

Though, the available manuscripts of the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa is usually dated to \~ 14^(th) century CE but it is acknowledged by scholars that the contents of the text can be tentatively dated to 4^(th) century BCE-2^(nd) century BCE to 6^(th) century CE (Modak, 1959). Thus, even though the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa is part of the later Vedic literature but its oldest contents are dated either contemporary to or post the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya. Since, it is usually not dated pre-Arthaśāstra with many of its contents certainly dating post that period, hence, chronologically the very first mention of the ritual actually with the name Nīrājana is from Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra.

**— Arthaśāstra**

In this text, the ritual of Nīrājana i.e. waving of light or lamp is mentioned primarily with regard to the health of animals, specifically horses and cattle. The military and the general economic purpose of these animals cannot be overstated. The text mentions a horse which has been kept in a stable specifically for the purpose of the nīrājana : “Those who take out for the purpose of riding such horses as are kept inside (the stables) either for the purpose of waving lights (nīrājana) or for medical treatment shall be fined twelve paṇas : nīrājanoparuddhaṃ vāhayataścikitsakoparuddhaṃ vā dvādaśapaṇo daṇḍaḥ (Arth Śā. 2. 30. 46; Shāmashāstry, 1951: 150). The ceremony combined the veneration of gods with propitiatory rites for certain species of animals, especially horse both before and after a military expedition, after change of seasons and in case of diseases. (Kapadia, 1963: 34).

“Horses shall be washed, bedaubed with sandal powder, and garlanded twice a day. On new moon days sacrifice to Bhūtas, and on full moon days the chanting of auspicious hymns shall be performed. Not only on the ninth day of the month of Aśvayuja, but also both at the commencement and close of journeys (yātrā) as well as in the time of disease shall a priest wave lights invoking blessings on the horses : …nīrājanāmāśvayuje kārayennavamehani…. (Arth Śā. 2. 30. 50-51; Shāmashāstry, 1951: 150). The ritual was apparently for the purpose of placating the demons causing disease in the cattle or horse (Saunders, 1922: 76). “With regard to cattle diseases (paśuvyādhimarake), not only the ceremony of waving lights in cow-sheds (nīrājanaṃ) shall be half done, but also the worship of family gods be carried out : paśuvyādhimarake sthānānyardhanīrājanaṃ svadaivatapūjanaṃ ca kārayet.” (Arth Śā. 4. 3. 16; Shāmashāstry, 1951: 235). As can be noticed, we still do not get a detailed procedure of this rite.

**§ Other Literature **

The ceremony has been mentioned by many ancient littérateurs like Kālidāsa in Raghuvaṃśa, Bāṇabhatta in Harṣacarita, Bhāsa in Pratijñāyaugandharāyaṇa, Bhavabhūti in Uttararāmacarita, Somadeva in Yaśastilaka etc. (Kapadia, 1963: 34; Patyal, 1993: 332).

The mentions are usually with regard to either a military horse or even a weapon like a bow etc. but the primary purpose is to propitiate the evil forces and to get the blessings of the gods like Agni usually before the battle to ensure a victory for the king (Kapadia, 1963: 34).

The flower of lotus seems to have been special for this ceremony across the literature as mentioned in Śrīharṣa’s Naiṣadhīyacarita which also notes of a special vessel for the ritual called nīrājanavardhamānaka (Kapadia, 1963: 35). Such lustration ceremonies for general welfare involving the royalty were also prominent in ancient Rome but unlike the Nīrājana they usually culminated with a sacrifice of a boar or a ram or a bull to the god Mars (Patyal, 1993: 327). As readers can notice from the discussion, there was never any sacrificing of animals included in the Nīrājana ritual.

**— Lohābhisāra**

Interestingly, the Nīrājana of weapons like a bow just mentioned finds an extension and identification in another ceremony. Amarasiṃha in Amarakośaḥ identifies the ceremony with Lohābhisāra. As can be understood from this nomenclature, it was done after the nīrājana with consecrated water before the war for the weapons carried by a king (Kapadia, 1963: 35). This reinforces the fact that the ritual was primarily related to military and the ultimate victory for the king in the battle. The first version involved waving of lights for “the enchantment of military-materials through the use of fire” (Kapadia, 1963: 35). Later, another aspect was added which meant “the arrangement of military expedition of animals, persons and men connected with it in order to endow them with magical power against enemies” with a consecrated water (Kapadia, 1963: 35). By later times, the combined ceremony involved nīrājana with water and then culminated with waving of lights.

**§ Later Sources** **: Descriptions **

**— Bṛhatsaṃhitā**

Until now, I have only mentioned the shorter mentions of this ritual but how grand this religious-military ceremony must have been in its entirety is something we learn from, for example Varāhamihira’s Bṛhatsaṃhitā. The ceremony has been mentioned in such detail that it is impossible to quote in its entirety but here I am presenting an abridged version of the same from the chapter 44 of Bṛhatsaṃhitā titled Nīrājanavidhiḥ.

Here, we learn that the ceremony is performed — for horses, elephants and men (warriors) — on the 8th, the 12th, or the 15th day of the bright half of Kārttika or Aśvayuja (when Lord Nārāyaṇa opens his eyes i.e. 11th of the bright half of Kārttika). On an auspicious spot, a triumphal arch is erected in the north-east of the town; a holy house (śānti-sadman) for the expiatory ceremony should be made with special wood and it is to be decorated with auspicious symbols and flags (Śāstrī, 1946: 333-334*.* Adh. XLIV. ŚI. 1-6); the house is be a home for a special horse, till the ceremony is concluded.

For seven days, an expiatory ceremony is done for the horse in the holy house. The horse is given a special auspicious string around the neck, and is never to be treated harshly, in fact is supposed to be soothed with holy hymns, instruments and songs.

Various gods like Sūrya, Varuṇa, Indra, Viṣṇu, Viśvadeva-s are to be worshipped. On the 8^(th) day, a special hermitage is made with a sacrificial fire altar in the front. Varāhamihira mentions various special materials to be offered into the fire while whishing for prosperity. For this purpose, a special ladle of gold or silver is to be used. The significant role of the king in the ceremony commences from here when he, accompanied by a veterinarian and an astrologer, takes his seat on a tiger-skin facing the East in front of the fire. The holy fire in the altar should be carefully observed for omens. This reminds of the points mentioned in Védilakṣaṇamchapter of the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa.

With the quarters resounding with musical instruments, conchs and punyaha hymns, a horse and an elephant are brought under the arch of the hermitage. Here again, the movement of both the animals is to be observed for omens and portents. For example, if either of these animal stands with its right leg uplifted, then the King would soon vanquish his foes without difficulty, the opposite can happen if the animals appear frightened. Similar omens are to be noted when the animal is provided with offerings of food like the rice balls. Then the horses of the army are to be touched with an Indian fig leaf dipped in the consecrated holy water with the accompaniment of expiatory and propitiatory hymns. The same is done for the army, the King and the elephants.

Another fascinating part of the ceremony is when the Purohita pierces the heart of a clay model of the enemy with a spike / spear while chanting abhicāra mantra-s.

These aspects of the ceremony reinforces the reason why the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa insists the purohita to only be an Atharvavedin. The purohita then gives the sanctified bits to the horse. The King then mounts the horse and proceeds northwards with his army. The words of Varāhamihira now deserves to be quoted in full here — 

“The King should proceed in the following manner. The breeze should be scented by the dripping ichor of elephants that are gladdened by the sounds of tabors and conchs. The King shines like the Sun in autumn owing to the mass of glittering rays issuing from his crest jewels. His beautiful garlands and clothes are shaken by white chowries disseminating waves of fine fragrance just as the Himālayas is surrounded by the rows of swans flying hither and thither. The King adorned with jewels of various colours, diamonds, crown, ear rings and armlets and brightened by the rays of numerous gems, creates the lustre of a rainbow. The King is accompanied by horses springing up to the sky, as it were, by elephants tearing up as it were the earth and by warriors who have defeated their enemies just as Indra is attended upon by the Gods who have defeated their foes. Or, he should proceed being adorned with diamonds and pearls, having garlands, head-dress, ointment and clothes, all white, an umbrella held over his head, and mounting an elephant, just as Venus does on a cloud having the Moon above him. One whose army consists of soldiers, horses and elephants in a jolly mood, who shines with the lustre of glittering weapons, is free from all unnatural mental dispositions and appears dreadful to the hosts of his enemies, will soon conquer the whole earth” (Śāstrī, 1946: Adh. XLIV. ŚI. 1-6).

**— The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa**

The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa (Khaṇḍa II. Chapter 159. Nīrājana Śānti Varṇana) also explains a detailed procedure to conduct this grand ceremony and its rituals like the one explained in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā. Here also the grand ritual is “to be gone through by a Sovereign to achieve welfare and riches to men, elephants, and horses. It is luck-bringing, fame-bestowing, and destroying enemies. It is to be gone through, full of enthusiasm by kings, for prosperity of the territory” (Kapadiya, 1963: 39).

The basic structure of the ceremony seems to the same with some significant differences between the two. The ceremony is no more to be conducted in autumn but in the spring month of Viśākha. The number of gods to be worshipped also increases. An idol is also supposed to be installed in an enclosure (āśrama) where the yajña is to be conducted.
“…Left to this āśrama dry sacrificial wood 8 Hasta in length and breadth is to be piled up. At the central gate is to be fixed up a five stringed thread of Dūrva-grass (Śatagranthi), in the middle (of the thresh-hold?) a Śatapāśi (a plant) is placed which is covered with Kuśagrass and then with earth. The ground where the śatapāśi touches should not be crossed by anyone before the royal elephant has marched on it…” (Kapadiya, 1963: 39).

Importantly, the ritual of piercing the heart of a made-up model of the enemy is completely absent here. Various animals are to be consecrated, omens to be interpreted just as explained by Varāhamihira but this time, an important step is to hold the royal insignia in the ceremony : “…After that a veneration of kingly insignias and weapons which are brought in the āśrama is to be undertaken. Then all elephants and horses are amuletted. The amulets are prepared from a five-stringed thread and are tied with the chanting of a mantra (Kapadiya, 1963: 39).” The ceremony culminates with a special ritual to be completed by the king:

“Wearing all precious jewels and being fanned by chowries, the king circumambulates thrice the lighted mass of fire-brands. Clearly, this is concerned with those fuel sticks, which are piled by the side of the Āśrama. The king goes to his house with the pre-entry of his army accompanied by war-cry, sound of musical instruments and joyful jumps of his foot-soldiers and with his four fold military strength. If he has honoured all the people appropriately then he should discharge them. This treatment of appeasement is called Nīrājanā..” (Kapadiya, 1963: 41).

Important to note that particular waving of lights mentioned is not found in either these decriptions from Bṛhatsaṃhitā or Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa but they have transformed into grander rituals.

Also as Kapadiya mentions, in both the cases we miss the decision that the Nirajanā is to be repeated after the conclusion of military undertakings as we expressly find mentioned by Kauṭilya (Kapadiya, 1963: 38; 42) or even as alluded in the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa.

**— The Agni & Skanda Purāṇa**

The ceremony as explained in the Agni Purāṇa (267. 24-30) seems to be an abridged version of the one in the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa. However, instead of circumambulating the fire-brands, the king is supposed to thrice circumambulate the city — “accompanied by the fourfold army and with the fire-brands, he should illuminate different quarters; and then the he should thrice circumambulate the city” (Patyal, 1993: 330). Similarly, the Skanda Purāṇa (4.2.89) suggests that the ritual of Nīrājana could be done with the water sprinkled from the tail of a cow for removing all evil and sicknesses and for prosperity of the realm. The ablutions are to be performed in a special shed which the text calls the snānavedi (Patyal, 1993: 330).

**— The Bhaviṣyottara Purāṇa**

A legend mentioned in the Bhaviṣyottara Purāṇa (Adhyāya 71. Nīrājanadvādaśī Vrata-Varṇana) states that the ceremony was instituted by king Ajapāla when his subjects implored him to give them a means of warding off all pains and diseases (Gonda, 1969: 72). The ceremony, to be performed in the night, is again more or less of the same structure as mentioned previously — the lustration of the deity (here Vişnu, Lakṣmī and other deities: this time with lights), cows etc. An interesting ritual mentioned is that “a woman of auspicious marks, a harlot, or a woman of a good family-all of them radiating, in a magical way, happiness, should swing a specified light (dārupātrikā) over or around the king’s head with auspicious mantra-s (Gonda, 1969: 72). Gonda also mentions another distinct step where after completion of the ceremony, now that the capital is free from evil influences the king must, at midnight, take a walk through that town (Gonda, 1969: 72).

**§ The Aśva-Gaja Pūjan **

As previously stated in the caption of the painting, there is a striking similarity between the Nīrājana rite — an important religious-royal ceremony that involved lustration of the king and various important components of an ancient Indian army i.e. the king, the warriors, the horses and the elephants — with the Aśva-Gaja Pūjan ceremony still celebrated in our royal houses, particularly by the House of Mewār. This is also an autumnal lustration rite of a horse and an elephant. The horse lustration continues to this day that involves ceremonial bathing of the animal after a visit to the Śrī Jagannātharāi Jī Temple. Then amidst the vedic chanting by Brāhmaṇa priests, the Mahārāṇā takes “a resolution of worshipping either 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 horses and elephants, present in odd numbers.” Horses are bedecked with new clothing, jewellary and then worshipped by putting a tilak. The lustration by performing the āratī (ārātrikam) of the selected horses is also performed after the horses have been fed the ceremonial meal like moong, gram, jaggery etc. The lustration with water sprinkled on the ingredients before worship is also an important part that certainly reminds one of the Nīrājana ritual.

**§ Notes **

1 — Abhicāraḥ refers to enchanting i.e. employment of magical incantations for either malevolent purposes or implemented in protection from such magic by exorcising their effects.

2 — Arth. Śā. Book IV – Removal of Thorns (Kaṇṭakaśodhanam), Chapter III – Remedies against National Calamities (Upanipātapratīkāraḥ) : “Persons acquainted with the rituals of the Atharvaveda, and experts in sacred magic and mysticism, shall perform such ceremonials as ward off the danger from demons” ; “Such ascetics as are experts in magical arts, and being endowed with supernatural powers, can ward off providential visitations, shall, therefore, be honoured by the king and made to live in his kingdom”(Shāmashāstry, 1951: 237).

3 — “Salutation unto that one whose fire of energy was like the flash of lightning, and through whose magical powers that resembled in potency and in fury the thunder-bolt itself \[avi(bhi)cāravajram\], the wide-spread, renowned, powerful and mountain-like dynasty of Nanda was eradicated for good. Salutation unto him who resembled the god Śaktidhara himself (in prowess) and who singlehanded, by means of his Mantraśakti and Utsāhaśakti, brought the entire earth under the thorough control of Chandragupta, the foremost of sovereigns. Salutation unto that wisest of counselors who collated the nectar-like Nīti Śāstra from the mighty main of the Arthaśāstra (Dutt, 1896: 2-3).

4 — The Kāmikāgama: Uttarabhāga , Chapter 7 ; Padmasamhita IV. 6
explains (verses 77-80) nīrājana vidhiḥ for the rite of ceremonial lamp-waving (nirājana); “Through this description we are reminded of that Nīrājana-vessel which the Nați in Gopalakelicandrikā shows to the public” (Kapadiya, 1963: 43). Noteworthy is the special Nīrājana vessel described in these sources — “a jar filled with water and fashioned out of gold or similar material…bedecked with a garland and…sprinkled with fragrant water and besides it is worshipped with unhusked corn. The top opening of the jar is covered over with Aśvattha-wood. It has a height of 4 angulas and is illuminated by wicks. With both the hands it is placed before the idol of god on a foot-stool meant for oblation” (Kapadiya, 1963: 43) — with which the idol is to be circumambulated thrice. It is tempting to notice the possibility of some similarity with those peculiar Indus-Sarasvati Valley Civilization seals in which an animal is standing besides a peculiar object on a stool. The later i.e. Atharvavedic & post-Vedic provenance of our sources for this ceremony suggests the possibility that originally, this could have been an ISVC ritual seamlessly amalgamated with Vedic ceremonies in later period. Nevertheless, it is not possible to say anything with certainty for now.
