Forging Magadha: War with the Vṛjji Confederation

The world loves conventionality – heroic struggles, fairy tale characters with well defined traits and uncomplicated moralities. The lure of it seems to come from the contrast that the real has always presented us with as oppose to the literary throughout history. Just as with regard to the metaphysical, the more we try to grasp its complexity, the more we try to simplify it, though usually not convincingly. It’s not as if the real lacks any genuine heroism and villainy or that the literary domain has any dearth of complicated characters but the lure of conventionality is such that even in the most unconventional of stories, we end up searching for it and thus defining it.

And indeed, this is where history as a subject challenges us for even though it has its fair share of heroes and villains but more often than not, it echoes the stories of the unconventional in its all chaotic glory and complicated morality.

The story of the rise of the Magadhan Empire, one of the greatest and earliest empires of the Indian history indeed has the most unconventional characters as its protagonists and Ajātaśatru, the Magadhan ruler (r. \~ 492 – 460 BCE) of the Haryaṅka Dynasty is probably the most unconventional of them all. A complete analysis of his story is neither possible in this single post nor am I aiming to do so; the topic at hand is going to deal with one of the most significant episodes of the rise of Magadha during the reign of Ajātaśatru – the war with the Vṛjji Confederacy (Vajjī in Pāli), an episode comprising of all unconventional, intriguing, complicated events to stimulate any curious mind, and certainly a history enthusiast.

**Background**

The rise of Magadha was based on fighting its own relatives. Matrimonial relations have always been part of political policy since the ancient times and Magadha in its Janapada period was no different. In fact, matrimonial alliances were one of the reasons behind the success of Bimbisāra (r. \~ 544 – 492 BCE), the famous Magadhan ruler of the Haryaṅka Dynasty, father and predecessor to Ajātaśatru. Even if we disregard the exaggerated number of 500 which the Mahāvagga gives for Bimbisāra’s wives, he certainly had many politically sagacious marriages. Besides his marriage with the sister of King Prasenjit of Kośala, princess Khemā from the Kingdom of Mādra in Central Punjāb and Cellanā, the daughter of Licchavi Chief Ceṭaka, Ajātaśatru himself was born of Bimbisāra’s marriage with a Videhan princess.

While Bimbisāra had conquered and annexed the Kingdom of Aṅga, putting Magadha on a path different than the other kingdoms of the time, Ajātaśatru wanted much more. Despite being quite an aspiring ruler himself, Bimbisāra has had harmonious relations with his neighbours and other kingdoms but Magadha under Ajātaśatru fought with major powers of the time like the Kingdoms of Kośala, Avanti – both have been discussed on this blog before – but his most significant struggle was with the Republican Confederacy of the Vṛjjis, headed by the Licchavi Chief-King Ceṭaka; a story so significant to ancient India, especially to the milieu of its newly emerging heterodox religions – Buddhism and Jainism – that it was repeated in total twelve versions in the Buddhist literature (Wu, 2019) and detailed by the Jain authors throughout their texts.

**Ambitions of Ajātaśatru**

As significant as Ajātaśatru was to the rise of Magadha, the man himself was quite the anti-hero. The Purāṇa-s refer to him as a powerful monarch subjugating the neighbouring kings, but ‘destitute of good policy’. Even the Buddhists agree on his powerful but cruel nature as seen by his epithets like Mahāsena (great warrior) and Caṇḍa, (cruel, wrathful, impetuous etc.) (HCIP II 2001, 23); his most infamous act was patricide to gain the throne of Magadha (HCIP II 2001, 23). Thus as Basham states, both in internal and external policy, Magadha under Bimbisāra and Ajātaśatru transcended earlier Indian conception of statecraft (Basham, 1951: 40) that he believed to have been an inspiration from the emerging Persian Achaemenid Empire which by then had made in-roads into the north west of the Indian subcontinent. For Basham, it seemed very unlikely that the two energetic kings of Magadha should have been unaware of what was happening on the north-western borders of India (Basham, 1951: 41).

It is certainly possible that the developments in the west may have some bearing on the changes in the east but it is also possible that like many major events in history, this indeed was also one accident where ambitions of one haughty king were sowing the seeds of future greatness which even he might not have intended. We may or may not agree with what Basham thinks regarding the inspiration behind the Magadhan shift but one fact is certain that during the reign of Bimbisāra, the annexation of as prosperous a kingdom as Aṅga with its wealthy and thriving capital-port city of Campā gave Magadha the control of trade at the eastern gate of ancient India (Basham, 1951: 41) and therefore, the wealth needed for continuous wars to gain as much control of the Gaṅgā river system as possible (Basham, 1951: 40), the importance of which cannot be overstated.

“…If we are to believe the Pāli accounts, an already flourishing trade with the south brought gold jewels and spices. Campā must have served as an entrepôt, from which southern luxury goods were distributed all over northern India….It may be possible to trace the same objective later, motivating the campaigns of Samudra Gupta, Śaśāṅka, and Dharmapāla – the king in possession of the lower course aiming at control of the whole river system (Basham, 1951: 40).”

**The Vṛjji** **Confederacy**

The Vṛjji-s, a powerful political confederacy which dominated Eastern India comprised of no less than 36 republican states namely 9 Mallaki, 9 Licchhavi, and 18 gaṇa-rājya-s of Kāśī-Kośala (HCIP II 2001, 23; Wu, 2025: 63). From the Buddhist sources it would seem that they were merely an alliance than of “the eight local tribes under the leadership of the Licchavis” but only Jains give us an idea of the much a wider alliance (Basham, 1951: 39) and its composition, which would explain why a ruler like Ajātaśatru would be wary of it, as suggested by the Buddhist sources themselves. The Licchavi-s of Vaiśālī as the most prominent of its Gaṇarājya-s headed by their chief Ceṭaka. These Gaṇarājya-s were, as political entities, not strictly republican as most were representative in structure lacking the typical direct democracy. But the term is still used mostly to signify the contrast with the monarchies.

Ceṭaka was an influential man himself. We know of him only through the Jain sources for he is told to have become a Jain devotee in later part of his life. As mentioned above, many states during this period had matrimonial relations amongst them and Ceṭaka had married off a few of the Licchavi princesses to various royal houses of the time. Cellanā’s marriage to Bimbisāra has already been mentioned, others include those of Sindhu-Sauvīra, Vatsa, and Avanti (HCIP II 2001, 25). But the Licchavi influence was not limited to the political sphere. Ceṭaka’s sister Triśalā was married to King Siddhārtha of Kuṇḍagrāma – parents to Mahāvīra, the 24^(th) Tīrthankara of the Jain. The Buddha, belonging to a Gaṇarājya himself, understandably had special affinity towards the republics. Thus, both Buddhism and Jainism had special connection with the Licchavi-s.

Due to these the diplomatic relations of the confederacy including many matrimonial alliances made during the reign of Ceṭaka, we can make an assumption of the strength of this mighty organization and their collective resources (HCIP II 2001, 25). Other point that needs to be addressed is that of eighteen gaṇa-rājā-s of Kāśī-Kośala.^(**1**) To summarise the issue, how was it that Kośala, the monarchy under Prasenjīta (Pasenadi) and his successor Virūdhaka (Viḍūḍabha) with Kāśī under their suzerainty came to have republican entities, the gaṇa-rājā-s? It is noteworthy that in the Janapada period, many gaṇa-rājyas existed as vassals to either of these monarchies. For example, we do know that the Malla-s were feudatory to Kośala. They seem to have had harmonious relationship under the benevolent rule of King Prasenjīta. But this took a turn to worse with Virūdhaka’s violent attempt to bring another such republic, the Śākya-s (Gautama Buddha belonged to this gaṇa-rājya) under Kośala. It can be said with confidence that this attempt was not appreciated by other gaṇa-rājya-s under Kośala who found the wanton attack as a threat to their constitution, their way of life (Basham, 1951: 39), to their very existence. Virūdhaka was most likely considering tighter control over those under his sovereignty, eschewing the lenient attitude of his father. Thus, tensions were already brewing when Virūdhaka suddenly died, probably in one such campaign against another tribal group (Basham, 1951: 39).

> “We suggest that these … tribes, unwilling to accept Vidūdabha’s
> suzerainty and incensed at his destruction of the Sākiyas, took
> advantage of his death to throw off all allegiance, and allied
> themselves with the strongest tribal republic of the region, the
> Vajjīs or Licchavis of Vesālī. ”
>
> (Basham, 1951: 39)

The Licchhavi-s were therefore, at the zenith of their power as the head of a vast confederacy and could draw upon its pooled resources. However, powerful as they were, a war against a mighty state, a monarchy like Magadha required serious deliberation. The republics knew their limitations in the political landscape of India, surrounded as they were by various monarchies of the period itching to oust the other to get the upper hand claiming the rule of the vast Gangetic plains. During the period when Magadha, Kośala, Avanti and Vatsa fought each other for supremacy, these various small and large republics remained under the sovereignty of one or the other of these kingdoms. However, Licchavi-s being the largest of the Gaṇarājya-s had mostly kept themselves independent of these concerns. But Ajātaśatru’s ambition had forced them to take decisions; Were Licchavi resources enough to sustain a war? In fact, it is mentioned that when warned by Ajātaśatru, Ceṭaka assembled the confederation, including all the republican chiefs and consulted on their future course of action, whether they should surrender to Ajātaśatru or fight him (HCIP II 2001, 24).

“Ajātaśatru was opposed by a powerful combination of hostile rulers of the east, including his old rivals, the chiefs of Kāśī and Kośala. The issue at stake was the Magadhan suzerainty over Eastern India and this was clearly realised by both sides (HCIP II 2001, 24).”

Of the four warring kingdoms, Magadha was increasingly becoming dominant. It was a matter of time before an ambitious ruler like Ajātaśatru would want to nullify the existence of these territories as Gaṇarājya-s and bring them under the ever growing Magadhan hegemony. A war was on the horizon, all it needed was a spark.

**The Spark**

Despite the legendary nature of the tales of the Jain and Buddhist literature, they still contain significant historical information and are our main source for the Magadha-Vṛjji conflict. While the Buddhist make dispute over a jewel-mine or a scented substance as the reason, the Jain sources state a huge controversy over the state elephant of Magadha and a huge pearl necklace. The immediate cause behind the long struggle between the Vṛjjis and Magadha thus varies as per its source.

**§** **The Buddhist Version**

During the period of Ajātaśatru, a jewel-mine was discovered at the foot of a hill at a port on the Gaṅgā. The location of the mine was such that Magadha and the Lichchhavi-s decided that they should have an equal share of the gems (HCIP II 2001, 23). But Ajātaśatru kept postponing the collection of his share and the Licchavi-s alone used to take away all of it, depriving Magadha its due and enraging Ajataśatru. In my opinion, this detail of him postponing the collection of his share could have been due to Magadha being embroiled with Kośala on one hand and Avanti on the other.

Infuriated, Ajātaśatru is told to have said, – “A fight against the Lichchhavian Republic is difficult as their blows never fail. But come what may, I will annihilate the great prosperity of the Vajjis, I will destroy them (Nagraj, 1930: 66).”

Another version of the story occurs in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, and in Buddhaghoṣa’s commentary. It says that a river port, divided half between Magadha and the Vṛjjis, produced a mysterious scented substance – (gandhabhaṇḍa) – which was much in demand. “Ajātasattu claimed this stuff, but when he sent his men for it on one occasion he found that the Vajjis had anticipated him and had taken it all. He vowed to extirpate the Vajjis root and branch, and his chief minister Vassakāra went to the Buddha to enquire whether the project was feasible (Basham, 1951: 37).”

**§** **The Jain Version**

In this story, the main reason was the Magadha State elephant Seyanaga (Sechanaka ‘the Sprinkler’) and a huge necklace of 18 strings of pearl given by Śreṇīya (Bimbisāra) to his sons Halla and Vehalla, step brothers of Ajātaśatru, and grandsons of Licchavi king Ceṭaka. The brothers are told to have carried off both the elephant (in the climax of must i.e. gandhahatthī) and the necklace to Vaiśālī, the Licchavi capital and sought the protection of their grandfather against Ajātaśatru.^(**2**) Kuṇika (as Ajātaśatru is named by the Jains)**³** could neither convince Ceṭaka to make Halla and Vehalla comeback nor return the precious elephant and the necklace. To top it all, incited by his wife after having failed to obtain the extradition of the fugitives peacefully, Kuṇika declared war on Ceṭaka.

The Jain Nirayāvalikā Sūtra tries not to make Kuṇika-Ajātaśatru a patricide and instead state that Bimbisāra committeed suicide in prison in order to save his usurping son the sin of patricide (Basham, 1951: 38), after which out of guilt he moved to Campā, the capital of Aṅga. But as mentioned above, he was incited by his wife – “called by the common Jain name of Padmāvatī” who always coveted both the treasures – against the Licchavi-s (HCIP II 2001, 23). Angered by Ceṭaka’s refusal, Kuṇika-Ajātaśatru vowed to “root out and destroy these Vajjians, mighty and powerful though they be, and bring them to utter ruin” and sent the ascetic Kūlavālaka to deceive the people of Vaiśālī (Wu, 2015).

Despite the differences, some similarities can be seen in both versions of the tale like the gandhabhaṇḍa in the Buddhist story corresponds to the gandhahatthī in the Jaina story (Basham 1951, 72–74); the deceiving role played by the minister Vassakāra corresponds to the one played by the ascetic Kūlavālaka (Wu, 2015). The jewel mine also corresponds with the jewel or the pearled necklace. It would not be an exaggeration to assume that such difference notwithstanding, there indeed were some common incidents which were interpreted, embellished and used differently by both of these sources, implying some genuine historicity underneath such legendary stories. It does seem likely that an ongoing economic dispute later blew up into a protracted war. Most importantly both the sources make Kuṇika or Ajātaśatru to be aware of the might of the Licchavi headed Vṛjjis; the phrases like – “their blows never fail,” and “mighty and powerful” to describe their heft shows that not only were they a wealthy confederacy but their warriors were also formidable.

**The Consult**

As per Buddhist sources, when Ajātaśatru had decided on finishing off the Vṛjjis, he sent his chief minister Vassakāra (Varṣākāra) to the Buddha, wanting his opinion and to enquire whether the project was even feasible (Basham, 1951: 37). Vassakāra told him of Ajātaśatru’s wish to finish of the Vṛjjis. Interestingly, the Buddha here did not speak against Ajātaśatru’s plans. Instead, he spoke about the seven Conditions of Welfare (satta aparihāniyā dhammā), which would ensure the prosperity of the Vajjī country as long as its citizens observed them (Pandita, 2011: 126). He proclaimed that “as long as the Vajjīs held together, had regular folk-meets, revered the ancestral shrines and respected their women they were invincible (Basham, 1951: 37). In the Pāli version, from the Buddha’s words, Vassakāra concluded that Magadha will not be able to defeat the Vṛjjis merely by force, without using intrigue or sowing internal dissension (Wu, 2015).

This meeting is quite an interesting turn in the tale because from what we learn from these sources, they do not suggest that had Buddha unequivocally spoken against Magadha’s plans against the Licchavi-s, then Ajātaśatru would have retracted his hostile policy. What then exactly was his purpose to ask for the Buddha’s advice on this matter? Moreover, Buddha’s disapproval regarding violence was already known. Pandita is of the opinion that by using Vassakāra (not known as a follower of the Buddha) as a scapegoat, the king removed any need to worry about his relationship with the Buddha even if the latter had taken an ethical stand against his ambition to overcome the Vajjīs (Pandita, 2011: 131).

The point regarding Ajātaśatru wanting the Buddha’s opinion for confirming whether “the project was even feasible” or had “everything to gain” from it is also interesting. What indeed did he expect to gain from the meeting? Was it because the Buddha belonged to a republic himself and hence could have some useful insights into the weak points of a gaṇarājya? There is thus great ambiguity in interpreting the substance behind this intriguing meeting. But equally intriguing is that despite Buddha’s known opinion regarding war and other kinds of violence; he indeed neither dissuades Ajātaśatru from walking down this path “nor does he remark on the immorality of war from a Buddhist ethical point of view (Wu, 2015: 97). Though, the context in which the meeting between the Buddha and Vassakāra has been narrated in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta is to provide “a stepping stone” for introducing the following sermon, where the Buddha teaches the monks seven principles that can prevent their community from declining” and not to show the Buddha’s discouraging stance on war (Wu, 2015: 97).

It also has been pointed out that such “absence of explicit condemnation of political warfare is not unique to the MPS \[Mahāparinibbāna Sutta\], but typical of most of early Buddhist canonical scriptures.” Even though, the Buddha has made “a clear rejection of the kṣatradharma (the duty of the warrior class i.e. fighting the war),” nonetheless, the early Buddhists “were almost certainly aware of the inevitability of warfare in the real world of ancient Indian politics, and the fact that any explicit condemnation of the utilization of military forces could have been interpreted by contemporary kings as an encroachment upon their political interests” does explain why the Buddha stayed neutral when he was told about Ajātaśatru’s plan regarding the Licchavi-s. But was this a reason sufficient to explain his stance before the war because he certainly did not appear as detached when he played an active part to resolve dispute between the Śākyas and Koliyas (Pandita, 2011: 127). Was it because he could sense the future greatness or even present dominance of Magadha under Ajātaśatru and hence ‘played safe’?

It is noticeable from the meeting that the Buddha seems to be lamenting the dissipating democratic values of the so-called republican tribes and deplored the passing of traditional virtues (Basham, 1951: 37). May be he could sense that the possibility of republics’ independence was becoming less and less in the future. Is it possible that the younger Vṛjjians were finding monarchy more suitable than the tribal oligarchies and favouring radical changes in their status quo? (HCIP II 2001, 333) But if Buddha was so worried about the future of tribal independence, should he not have given this advice to the Vṛjjis, encouraging them on the correct path instead of pronouncing it to the Magadhan minister, the enemy of tribal unity? Was this an attempt to help Ajātaśatru in his goals hoping that the impending struggle would be less protracted and hence less bloody? Did Buddha, sensing the inevitability of the Magadhan dominance was giving an easier way out to Ajātaśatru for a quicker victory rather than a long war between the two?

Importantly, when Buddha went north on his last journey post his meeting with Vassakāra, crossing the Ganga with his followers, he once again met Vassakāra, and with another minister named Sunīḍha, supervising the construction of a fort at the village of Pātaligāma (the later Pāṭaliputra), and prophesied the future greatness of the site (Basham, 1951: 37). Unfortunately, we can never answer the questions with surety and can only assume Buddha’s intentions by trying to read between the lines.

**Intrigues & Preparations**

Even on this topic, the story is very different in the Buddhist version vis-à-vis the Jain version. While one mentions an elaborate intrigue, other makes a personal conflict the immediate issue. Let’s start with the former. As mentioned above, both Ajātaśatru and his minister realised that the Vṛjjis had to be broken from within through “with bribery and disunion.” This idea is echoed later by the great Kauṭilya in his Arthaśāstra where he urges upon the kings to destroy these States by exploiting their weakness, chiefly by sowing dissensions among the members of the assembly (HCIP II 2001, 334).

And so it was planned that Vassakāra would feign dispute with Ajātaśatru and flee to Vaiśālī, the Licchavi capital as a refugee.

“The king asked the minister, ‘How to sow disunion?’ Vassakāra said, ‘tomorrow please mention about the Vajjīs in the assembly. I shall speak in their favour and shall send a gift for the Vajjīs. Punish me for this by expelling me out of your kingdom with a shaven head. I shall go saying I have built your ramparts, defensive trenches, I know the weak points thereof. Call me not Vassakāra if I fail to set you right soon.’ The next day all that happened. These talks reached the Vajjis also. Some people said: ‘This fraud let Vassakāra not come across the Ganges. But many said the event that has happened is very much in our favour. Ajātaśatru used to take advice from Vassakāra. He is intelligent. Why should we not make use of him? He is now an enemy of our enemy and therefore an honoured friend of ours (Nagraj, 1930: 68).” Vassakāra thus ended up in “position of trust in the council of the tribal chieftains” and initiated his plan of carefully crafting disunion, doubt and disruption amongst its members.

Meanwhile, Ajātaśatru was doing preparations for the impending war. Magadha was fighting at many fronts at this time. On one hand, Ajātaśatru had agreed for a détente with Kosala which was now embroiled in its own problems after sudden death of its new king Viḍūdabha, son of the great Prasenjīta. On the other was the lingering double menace — from Avanti under Caṇḍa Pradyota Mahāsena in the west and the Lichchhavi-s in the north (HCIP II 2001, 26). Even though the Magadhan capital Rājagṛha had recently had its fortifications strengthened in defence of an impending attack from the Avanti Kingdom (HCIP II 2001, 26), it still was too far inland and remote to serve as an efficient base of operations against the Licchavi-s who were on the other side of the Gaṅgā (HCIP II 2001, 24) . It was then deemed necessary to construct a new base i.e. a new fort and the village of Pātaligāma on the Gaṅgā was chosen as the suitable site which as mentioned above, even Buddha visited and prophesied its greatness. Thus, the great capital owed its origins to the Magadha-Vṛjji tensions.

However, it is important to mention that the fort on Gaṅgā was built specifically for defence, not offence (Basham, 1951: 38). The preliminary constructions alone must have taken at least two years (HCIP II 2001, 25). And if we consider the three years that Vassakāra took to complete his task then even before the war, Magadha had spent at least three to five years in its preparation when Vassakāra’s intrigues finally bore fruit. The Licchavi-s were no longer a cohesive unit, infected by self-doubt and distrust \[NOTE—For a detailed story of how Vassakāra achieved this, see Nagraj, 1930: 68-69\]. Vassakāra now felt confident enough to send the message signalling his success to Ajātaśatru who promptly set out with his army.

“A bugle blew in Vaiśālī. ‘Come on let us go and prevent the enemy from crossing the Ganges.’ None turned up. Another bugle was sounded. ‘Come on let us not allow the enemy to enter the city and close the gates to check the enemy.’ None came forward on hearing the bugle but ironically they would say, ‘We are poor, we are coward, how can we fight? Those who are rich and brave shall fight. Ajātaśatru entered the city through the open gates, ruined Vaiśālī and returned (Nagraj, 1930: 69).”

This “superficial victory” in words of Basham over the capital Vaiśālī described by the Buddhist sources was most likely preceded by a long war, as can be understood from the Jain sources, or even other Buddhist sources which will be discussed shortly. Neither Ajātaśatru’s victory was so easy nor the Vṛjjis were sitting ducks. The Buddhist sources, as mentioned before make Ajātaśatru point out the wealth, prosperity and warrior spirit of these people. Vaiśālī was thus could only be taken after along war, and even then, the final victory came long after the battle was won by Magadha.

The exaggerated manner of the Jain version of the story in its pre-war period makes it somewhat less believable as compared to its Buddhist version. So here it will be mentioned only in brief. As mentioned previously, the Jain sources tell a completely different tale where the source of contention is not a jewel-mine but the state elephant of Magadha and a special pearled necklace (In some versions of the story, the list adds divine earrings and garments as well). Apparently, Kūṇika (Ajātaśatru) then sent an angry letter to Ceṭaka with an emissary to demand his treasures back and to warn him of repercussions if his demands were not complied with.

> “The emissary complied. Ceṭaka got angry with the contents of the

> crores of foot soldiers came to Vaiśālī.”
>
> (Nagraj, 1930: 62)

As is noticeable from this excerpt, there was no elaborate intrigue in the pre-war stage to conquer Vaiśālī. The role that the ascetic played in capturing the city comes in the later part of the story in post-war period and will be mentioned later in this post.

**Events of the Battles**

From the myriad of versions of the war narrative available to us in both the Buddhist and Jain texts, and from the exaggerated, legendary manner of those stories which both kinds of sources are usually inclined to, especially the Jains, it indeed becomes a difficult task to filter a genuine historical narrative from the husks of embellished details. But legendary style of these texts aside, as mentioned before, they still are our only source for learning anything significant about this major event. Both of the versions will now be stated separately, albeit in brief.

**§** **The Buddhist Version**

As stated above, the Buddhist version gave a rather simple end to Vassakāra’s intrigues when Ajātaśatru, after receiving the message from his minister, entered Vaiśālī, ravaged the city and returned (Nagraj, 1930: 69). But this “superficial victory” is elaborated in the Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya-s (Wu, 2019: 300) \[There are other versions of the story where sometimes only one battle is mentioned, sometimes it is between the Licchavi-s and Bimbisāra etc. but these versions need not concern us here\]. The texts relate how Ajātaśatru marched out with his four-fold army (elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry) and having learnt of this, the Licchavi-s marched out of Vaiśālī when they saw the sage Mahāmaudgalyāyana coming into Vaiśālī for alms. Out of curiosity, they asked about the outcome of the war – “O Noble Sir, King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, is going to destroy the Vṛji country. We come out to fight a battle. Will we win?” To this, the sage replied – “Men of the Vāsiṣṭha lineage,^(**4**) you will win.” This boosted the morale of their people and the army fought with great vigour (Wu, 2019: 306).

The result was that Ajātaśatru lost the first battle. Dejected, the Magadhan King turned back and went to the bank of Gaṅgā and contemplated – “These Licchavis of Vaiśālī are vicious and destructive. If I jump into the Ganges, they would pull me out with a net or a fishing-hook and make me afflicted with misery (Wu, 2019: 306). It would be better if I die facing forward (Wu, 2019: 306-307).” With no intention of giving up any more, Ajātaśatru returned with his army and fought so valiantly that Magadha won the battle decisively. Completely crushed, the Licchavi-s returned to their capital Vaiśālī.

“Having cut off entrances and erected fences, they stayed \[inside\]. King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, having won the battle and triumphed over the Vṛji country, returned to Rājagṛha.” ^(**5**) Vaiśālī was eventually captured as well (Wu, 2019: 307).

**§** **The Jain version**

The Jain texts give more details regarding Kūṇika’s i.e. Ajātaśatru’s military activities against the Vṛjjis, a much larger and powerful confederation in these texts vis-à-vis the Buddhist sources. The ﬁfth Aṅga Viyāhapannatti (Skt. Vyākhyāprajñapti) of the Śvetāmbara canon, or Bhagavaī-sutta (Skt. Bhagavatī-sūtra) (\~ 1^(st) C. BCE/1^(ST) CE – 3^(rd) C. CE) tell us about the two battles between Magadha and the Vṛjjis namely, the “Battle of Great Stones” (Pkt. mahāsilākaṇṭaga saṃgāma) and the “Battle of the Chariot with the Mace” (rahamusala
saṃgāma), both of these were won by Magadha. According to the text, each battle had large number of casualties.

**§** **The New Weapons**

Since the Jain text give so much importance to these weapons to name entire battles after them, it is important to firstly tackle the question regarding the authenticity of these weapons. The possibility cannot be denied that the weapons mentioned were either fantastical or actually belonged to a later period but retrospectively mentioned in the legend of the Magadha-Vṛjjis war. Of the two weapons, Mahāśilākaṅṭaka was some kind of catapult that hurling heavy pieces of stone while Rathamūsala, if the sources are taken literally, a chariot with attached rods that did significant destruction. “It is described to have moved without horses and driver” which some historians interpret to possibly have been “propelled by a person concealed inside who turned the wheels.” However, rather than this contrived description, some scholars prefer a much more known weapon i.e. a typical battering ram (Basham, 1951: 41) used since the ancient times by many states as a weapon of siege, to breach the fortification at their vulnerable points, especially against their masonry walls.

If taken to be true, the Mahāśilākaṅṭaka could be considered one of the earliest, if not the earliest use of catapult other than the traction trebuchet used in China during its Warring States period (\~ 5th c. BCE). Some historians consider it highly unlikely that the Jain texts are not exaggerating or as mentioned above, not retrospectively using them for this period. The earliest known use of catapult comes from the Second Book of Chronicles of the Old Testament where it is stated that king Uzziah of Judah (r. \~ 792 – 740 B.C.E) used engines that discharged great stones to defend Jerusalem. The text is however, said to have been composed in \~ 5^(th) c. BCE, some suggested dates being as late as \~4^(th) – 3^(rd) c. BCE. Even Greeks seemingly started using them around early \~ 4^(th) c. BCE. Considering the period for first Chinese trebuchet mentioned, coupled with the aforementioned facts, we can have an estimate time-frame of \~ 5^(th) c. – 3^(rd) c. BCE where ancients started using catapults. So, it is not impossible that Magadha made indegenous inventions in this field.

Adding to this, we should also consider that Magadha in the period of Bimbisāra and more significantly, Ajātaśatru was no ordinary state.

This piece of land and its kings were knowingly or unknowingly, drivers of India’s destiny, making tectonic shifts in its politics, culture and even religion. So why is it not possible that they indeed “outstripped their contemporaries” even in military affairs, making important developments in its weaponry as well. After all, we do know of Ajātaśatru’s continuous conflicts with his formidable neighbours, Kośala and Avanti; we also know that he had quite a few years to prepare for a war that he not only considered impending but for all intents and purposed had actively demanded. Across history, states at war, especially protracted wars are known to have birthed significant inventions, taking giant leaps in very short periods that would have been unlikely, even impossible in peacetime.

**§** **The Long War**

The texts inform us that the Magadha-Vṛjjis war stretched for an estimated time of 16 years between 484 to 468 BCE. On one hand, Maskarin Gośāla (Makkhali Gosala, the Ājīvika sage and rival to Mahāvīra), who died in 484 BCE “saw this war in progress”, on the other hand, when Mahāvīra died, the Vṛjji Confederation conducted “a joint illumination to mark the disappearance from their midst of the light that was in their Lord.” This suggests that the federation existed as one up to 468 BCE, the date of Mahāvīra’s death (HCIP II 2001, 26).

Some can rightfully question the authenticity of such a long time period for the war but this is well within the realm of possibility because in my opinion this is not duration of the great battles fought between the armies. This seems to include the years spent in not only the cold-war intrigues and the defensive fortifications that laid the foundation of Pāṭaliputra before the two great battles, but also the long siege of Vaiśālī after Ajātaśatru’s victory in the two main battles. We are also told that Mahāvīra was alive when both these battles took place. So, it is likely that the battles took place sometime in the middle of this 16 years period. It is also possible that this sixteen year period also included many skirmishes between the two rivals which may have kept the cauldron bubbling but probably were not significant enough for a separate mention.

The Śvetāmbara Jaina literature is our main source for detailed information on Kuṇika’s i.e. Ajātaśatru’s battles against the Vṛjjis, his conquest of Vaiśālī, and the death of Ceṭaka. In Wu’s opinion, since only the battle narrative is found in both canonical and post-canonical texts, it likely, though not certainly, emerged earlier and the rest of the arch possibly represents later narrative traditions. (Wu, 2025: 63).

The Nirayāvalikā Sūtra and the Bhagavatī Sūtra tell us of two great battles – “The Battle of Mahāśilākaṅṭaka” i.e. The Battle of Catapult or The Battle of Great Stones (Skt. Mahaśilākaṅtaka Saṃgrāma; Pkt. Mahāsilākaṇṭaga Saṃgāma) and “The Battle of Rathamūsala” i.e. The Battle of Battering Ram or The Battle of the Chariot with the Mace (Skt. Rathamūsala Saṃgrāma; Pkt. Rahamusala Saṃgāma).

**§** **The Battles**

During the first battle, on the first day, we are told that Kālikumāra, the commander-in-chief of Kuṇika-Ajātaśatru put his forces in the Śyena or the Garuḍa Vyūha i.e. an eagle order which is usually considered an offensive formation while Ceṭaka organised his army in the Śakaṭa Vyūha i.e. in a cart-shaped formation, typically a defensive one (Nagraj, 1930: 63). Though it seems that the Magadhan offense did not work for Ceṭaka with his unfailing arrow is told to have killed Kālikumāra and then every next Magadhan commander – all brothers of Kuṇika-Ajātaśatru – for the next nine days (Nagraj, 1930: 63; Basham, 1951: 38). Ceṭaka, a devotee of Mahāvīra had taken a vow that he will not shoot more than one arrow a day (Nagraj, 1930: 63) using his gift of being an excellent shot quite judiciously. Thus, the situation was turning worse for Ajātaśatru but he had been fasting for three days and worshipping the gods Indra and Camara to find a way to victory. Finally, he was blessed and the Magadhan army brought out “the secret weapon” on the eleventh day; a gift from the god Indra (Basham, 1951: 38), the Mahāśilākaṅṭaka. Along with it, Indra also gifted Ajātaśatru with “an impenetrable thunder bolt resistant armour…so that Ceṭaka’s unfailing arrow could not kill him” (Nagraj, 1930: 63-64). The destruction that Mahāśilākaṅṭaka caused turned the tables for Magadha but a complete victory was still far.

It seems the events in the second battle had similar trajectory in which the army of Magadha was saved in the last moments with another great weapon, literally a chariot-club (Rathamūsala) i.e. possibly a battering ram, this time a gift from the god Camara (Lord of the Asuras) (Basham, 1951: 38). It is told to have been a chariot with its “hammer moving about in the midst of the army throughout the day striking” many men (Nagraj, 1930: 63-64). Thus, both the battles are told to have caused great carnage and a high number of soldiers were slain.^(**6**) As a result, Magadha won both the battles.

**The Seige**

From the early medieval commentator Jinadāsa Gaņī in his cūrņī to the Āvaśyaka Sūtra, we learnt that post their defeat in these battles, the great Vṛjji-s confederacy broke up; “the confederate chieftains went home, and Ceṭaka, forced to fight alone, retreated to Vaiśālī (Basham, 1951: 38).” Vaiśālī was locked down; the gates of the rampart were shut. From the same text, we learn that Vaiśālī was besieged for twelve long years (Basham, 1951: 38). Kuṇika-Ajātaśatru tried to break the ramparts but failed. Vaiśālī was now under siege. Ajātaśatru tried but he could not bring the city down (Nagraj, 1930: 64). It is interesting however, that if the Rathamūsala was indeed a battering ram, why was it not mentioned by the Jain texts for its use in breaking the ramparts of Vaiśālī considering the fact that it is usually a weapon of seige? Or it was used and our texts just did not consider it important enough to mention it separately? Is it possible that it was not a battering ram but something more ingenious? Unfortunately, we can never be truly sure of either of these possibilities.

The Jain sources now turn the story all the more towards the legendary in which the Magadha ruler prayed to a goddess to find a way to win the Licchavi capital. To this the goddess replied with an oracle – “When Śramaņa Kūlavālaka will be enamoured by the prostitute Magadhikā, king Aśokacandra (Kuṇika) shall capture Vaiśālī (Nagraj, 1930: 64-65).” The story from this point on wards is not much of our concern. But the result was that Ajātaśatru was able to trace out the sage and the prostitute, finally achieving his goal.^(**7**) Though, it does seem like the city was brought down from within due to intrigues^(**8**) rather than outside by the Magadha’s army which could only break the ramparts when intrigues and disunion had broken the people from within.

Halla and Vehalla ran away with the coveted treasures, losing the precious elephant that eventually died on the way, being reborn in the first heaven. The necklace was also picked up by a goddess and Halla and Vehalla are taken to Mahāvīra where they were ‘initiated as monks in the Jaina order.’ Disturbed by the events, Ceṭaka meditated on Mahāvīra and then drowned himself in a pond to be reborn again in heaven. Important to note that these late Jain texts mention the confederacy as broken in the aftermath of the battle but we do know that these republics came together as one in remembrance of Mahāvīra when he passed away. It is possible that the Vṛjji-s broke up only with regard to actively fighting but kept supporting the Licchavi-s materially from behind, thus explaining how the Licchavi-s could sustain being beseiged for so many years.

**Remarks**

Despite such glaring differences between the Buddhist and the Jain sources, we do find some similarities, even in their war narratives. In some points, the Buddhist version seems more reliable for its simplicity, in other the Jain version fulfills the details lacking in the former. Firstly, as mentioned above, the jewel-mine and the jeweled necklace commonality suggests there were genuine economic tensions between Magadha and the Licchavi-s. It also seems from the Jain texts that Magadha at this period, did not have a large standing army for Kūṇika when deciding to go to war, “summoned his ten brothers (Kalikūmara etc.) and asked them to go to their states and come back prepared with your armies (Nagraj, 1930: 62).” Accompanied by his own army, then these armies collectively went to Vaiśālī for war.” It is then possible that the large standing army, famously mentioned by the Classical sources during Alexander’s invasion was the Nanda innovation.^(**9**)

Despite the strength of Magadhan forces, both the versions also agree with regard to the Licchavi prowess especially in archery, something that even Ajātaśatru found formidable which is also corroborated by the Jain mention of Ceṭaka’s unfailing arrow. So powerful were the Vṛjji-s in the battlefield that the Buddhists mentioned them winning the battle and routing Ajātaśatru before he found himself in a ‘do or die’ situation, finally mustering enough courage to go back and snatch away a resounding victory from the Licchavi-s The Jain texts also show the republican forces winning until Magadha brought out the ‘the secret weapons’.

Another point needs special mention that despite winning both the battles, the Jain texts clearly represent Vṛjji-s and the Licchavi capital Vaiśālī still strong enough to hold out a long siege. “The Jain tradition attributes the defence of the city to the influence of the tope. Buddha says, ‘So long as the Vajjis respect the topes inside and outside the city they will prosper and suffer no harm’ (Nagraj, 1930: 71).”

Thus, it were the intrigues, maneuvering and disenchantment amongst the Licchavi-s that ultimately brought them down.

It is also noteworthy that this war was only possible in the vacuum that Kośala’s downfall created. The power and benevolent rule of Prasenjīta had kept Ajātaśatru in check but Virūdhaka’s early death made Magadha hungry for more and in absence of a counterbalancing monarchy, the Licchavi-s with their prosperous lands became Magadha’s target. Though no source explicitly mentions whether the various matrimonial alliances that the Lichcavi-s had made had helped them in any way but the strength with which the republican forces defended themselves against Magadhan offence and the long siege which Vaiśālī endured, all of it suggests that the Vṛjji-s at least had covert help from others, possibly Avanti, probably the strongest of Magadha’s rival. Nonetheless, Magadha endured and kept the fight going, reaping victory in the end. If in the post-Virūdhaka vacuum, Magadha ended up controlling ‘further length of the Gaṅgā’, the overthrow of the Vṛjji-s gave Ajātaśatru ‘a foothold north of the river’, and thus Magadha was now controlling both banks.

**Conclusion**

There is no doubt that Magadha was changing the Indian political landscape for good. Bimbisāra’s annexation of Aṅga provided the wealth required to aspire and hope for a stronger and larger Magadha, Ajātaśatru’s ambitions provided the drive for accomplishing it. And for him, if that meant being in almost constant state of war, the risk was worth the gain. It is true that Ajātaśatru fought with Kośala for the same ambition but the war with the Vṛjji-s ended up being the factor that changed Magadha for good. The sixteen year period of conflict must have made significant changes in the structure of its politics and soceity both. It must have resulted in a much tighter, and therefore, more central control over its kingdom later taken to new levels, firstly by the Nanda-s and then by the great Maurya-s. The greatness of the future Magadha that we know of was thus forged in its war with the Vṛjji-s.

Notes —

**§** 1. To freshen up the information on this, readers of the blog can read my posts regarding the Magadha-Kośala conflict here: [“Rise & Fall of Kośala”](https://cestlaviepriya.wordpress.com/2021/11/01/rise-fall-of-kosala/) and [“Magadha & Avanti: The End of the House of Pradyota-s.”](https://cestlaviepriya.wordpress.com/2021/02/21/magadha-avanti-the-end-of-the-house-of-pradyota-s/)

**§** 2. Since, in some Buddhist texts, Ajātaśatru is called Videhaputta i.e. son of Videhan princess, and as the Licchavi-s ruled the earstwhile Videha Kingdom, it is sometimes understood based on the corroboration of the Jain sources, that Ceṭaka was also grandfather to Ajātaśatru.

**§** 3. Interestingly, the name finds resonance in the medieval Buddhist literature from China where Ajātaśatru is also called “The Broken Finger” i.e. Kuṇika.

**§** 4. The Licchavi-s are frequently addressed as Vāsiṣṭhas in some Buddhist texts, for instance, in the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya (Wu, 2019: 306).

**§** 5. The story then moves towards the people of Vaiśālī blaming the sage Mahāmaudgalyāyana for wrongly predicting their victory. The Buddha then explains that “Maudgalyāyana can only meditatively perceive the preceding event (i.e. the fight between Magadhan and Vṛji non-humans) at one stage of the war, his prediction is only accurate for that stage; he can see the precedent but cannot see the subsequent (Wu, 2019: 311).

**§** 6. Both the Buddhists and the Jain struggle with explaining the compatibility of their ideas of puritan non-violence with the pervasive Hindu belief of a battle slain soldier attaining heaven for duly following his kṣatriyadharma. For these soldiers committing violence, both the Buddha and Mahāvīra explain various levels of births in hell, or animal realm before being able to attain a noble rebirth. For example, they mention that “the ten half-brothers (of Kūṇika) all fall into hell after death, and after finishing their lifespan in hell, they will be reborn in the land of Mahāvideha, where they will attain enlightenment and ultimate liberation” (Wu, 2025: 64). Also see, Wu, 2015: 106. “The absence of condemnation suggests that both the Buddhists and Jainas, who composed or transmitted those texts, were unwilling, or at least hesitant, to apply the ethical-religious principle of
nonviolence to political affairs such as a king’s obligation to expand his kingdom. Their unwillingness, in turn, suggests that both religious groups were clearly aware of the inevitability of warfare in the real political world in which they were living, and the impracticability of totally abandoning military forces for any kingdom intending to survive in such a violent world. (Wu, 2015: 107).”As per the Jain sources, the only exceptions in the story are the Jaina layman Varuṇa, his friend who are pleasantly reborn without going through various levels of hell (Wu, 2025: 63), and King Cețaka who was a devotee of Mahāvīra and had taken the twelve vows of a Jain devotee (Nagraj, 1930: 63).

**§** 7. To read the story of this part in full, see. Nagraj, 1930: 65.

**§** 8. The destruction of the stūpa which protected Vaiśālī by its own people of at Kūlavālaka’s instigation suggests disunion from within.
