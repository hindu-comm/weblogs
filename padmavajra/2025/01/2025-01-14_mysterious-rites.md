mysterious rites

The probable author of all the piśāca and piśācī sādhanās was a certain Prajñāpālita. His sādhanās of the same names all exist in the Tibetan Buddhist Tengyur. His teacher in that text is recorded as a certain Mañjughoṣa. Tārānātha records a certain Prajñāpālita as a disciple of Ānandagarbha. I can’t say if both names refer to the same person, though the dates align somewhat when looking at the claimed manuscript date.Also, it is to be seen if they are the same sādhanās in translation.

The names of the other sādhanās are also suggestive:gaṇacakra,mahāmāya(likely paired with Buddhakapāla?), Chinnamastā and Kurukullā, who all have strong prescences in Vajrayāna.

Could this manuscript and the later Hindu practitioners be a possible remnant of what would later be called Cīnācāra?
