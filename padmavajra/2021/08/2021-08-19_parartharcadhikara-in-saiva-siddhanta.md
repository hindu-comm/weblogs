Paraphrasing SK Ramachandra Rao’s Shiva Kosha,worship of Śiva is of two
types

-   Svārtha(home worship/worship in one’s private shrine)
-   Parārtha(worship in a public temple on behalf of others/another
    person)

The former category of worship is allowed to all in Saiddhāntika
Āgama,but the latter category is restricted by the Āgamas to a
particular subsection of brahmins alone who are descended from a set of
sages directly initiated by Śiva Himself:The sages mentioned vary,but
they are usually

-   Kauśika
-   Bharadvāja
-   Kaśyapa
-   Gautama or Nandi(the ape faced attendant of Śiva)
-   Agastya or Atri

This implies only these brahmins who are descendants of the above sages
and have been born in families with a heritage of performing the rites
of public worship according to the Siddhānta āgama in an unbroken
chain,generation after generation,can offer public worship in temples
that run according to the Siddhānta. These brahmins in the living
tradition are to be revered as forms of Śiva Himself. More
crucially,these brahmins belong to a set of *gocaras* which are in their
fold alone now,this marks them out from other ordinary brahmins
belonging to these gotras.
