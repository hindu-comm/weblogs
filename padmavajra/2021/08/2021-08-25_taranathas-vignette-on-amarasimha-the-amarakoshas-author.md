Also the Acarya Amarasimha was a fully ordained monk  
as well as the king’s scribe and could also discourse on the  
metaphysics of both Mahayana and the Theravada. Supported  
by the Tara Tantra, he was able to make the Noble Lady into  
his personal tutelary divinity.Having made his abode in the  
land of Malava in the west, he taught Abhidharma (Metaphysics)  
to about 500 advanced students for about 24 years while  
he stayed there, so it is said. All of those 500 students in  
attendance on him gained exceedingly pure minds. Once there  
was the heretic Naga King known as Lalita in that area and he  
suddenly caused a fierce, unbearable rainstorm to fall and the  
rain formed a fast-running river like the Yamuna. It drew very  
near to the Acarya’s abode and also to many hamlets. The  
Acarya prayed to Arya Tara and as a result the water swirled  
round to die right of the Acarya’s home and the city of  
Utajayana (Ujjain) many times and finally flowed off into  
another great river, and only the Naga’s den and a small  
Turuska village were carried away. Tara prophesied to him  
in the following words, “Compose a work explaining key  
terms!” and he wrote the work known as the Amara-kosa,  
which to this very day is extremely widely known in India  
among Buddhists and non-Buddhists. The king whose scribe  
he was is said to have been Vikramaditya.

Despite the anachronism of the mention of Turuṣkas which is an accretion
onto the tale of Amarasimha ,Taranatha is probably recording a genuine
traditional tale of the lexicographer here genuinely(as transmitted by
his Indian informer).
