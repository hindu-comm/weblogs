अतीशवागीश्वरकीर्त्योः तारामन्त्रस्य पुरश्चरणविशये केचन वाक्यानि

From Stephan V Bayer’s The Cult of Tara:Magic and Ritual in Tibet  
  

> If one consults the Tantra of Tara the Yogini, the author says, it  
> would seem that little importance is attached to daily purity and so  
> on; but, according to the long-established tradition of Atisa, it is  
> best if the practitioner washes .the dwelling, the utensils, and
> himself with bathing water over which has been recited the
> “conquering” mantra, if he gives up meat and beer and so on while he
> is practising the ritual service, and if in short he keeps himself in
> a condition of bodily purity. He should avoid garlic and onions,
> which  
> pollute the strength of his speech, and beer and drugs, which produce
> drowsiness; he should avoid anything that might cause contamination or
> distraction, and he should wash himself again and  
> again with water over which the mantra has been recited. In this  
> connection, the text recommends the ritual of Bhavabhadra  
> for  
> the practitioner to cleanse away any lapses in his vows. And before  
> beginning the ritual, he should first determine by an examination  
> of omens ….

> Finally, the handbook talks of the requisite number of recitations  
> in the ritual service, and our author quotes Candragomin: “Reciting  
> 300,000 or 600,000 or 1,000,000 times, one accomplishes all
> functions.” And Vagisvarakirti said: “The count for the syllables of
> the  
> mantra is 100,000.” Thus the basic measure of ritual service is  
> 100,000 recitations; but it is also held that in this “age of
> contention”  
> one should recite four times as much. Drubch’en rinpoch’e said:  
> “It is said that if one recites the 10-syllable mantra 10,000,000  
> times, one’s qualities will equal those of the noble Tara herself.”  
> That is to say, if one completes 10,000,000 recitations, one will
> have  
> the power to accomplish all functions and magical attainments. The  
> oral tradition ascribed to the Chenngawa, however, holds that if the  
> practitioner devotes himself to a ritual service of 100,000
> recitations  
> he will be unharmed by any impediments; since she is a deity of  
> active function, it is quick and easy to succeed in her ritual
> service.  
> And since there is a great deal of evidence for this position in the  
> expanded commentaries upon the various histories of Tara, our  
> author concludes, we may place our belief therein.
