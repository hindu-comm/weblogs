Japa:The main aṅga of puraścaraṇa in the framework of aṣṭāṅga yoga

In a Pātañjala/aṣṭāṅga yoga framework,according to Swami Saccidananda Saraswati in his Puraścaraṇapradīpa(পুরশ্চরণ-প্রদীপ) counts japa as the 7th limb of yoga. The others being

1.  Yamas 2.  Niyamas(explained
    [earlier](https://padmavajra.net/2023/12/09/yamas-and-niyamas-and-donts-during-purashcharana/)) 3.  Asana(the ability for a fixed posture for an extended period of
    time) 4.  Prāṇāyāma(this depends on the mantra and the practice given by one’s
    guru) 5.  Pratyāhāra(withdrawal of the mind from external objects of the
    senses \[towards the inward features of the deity in the heart\]) 6.  Dhāraṇa(fixing one’s mind on the image of the deity according to the
    dhyānaśloka) 7.  After all the above one actually can engage in fruitful japa .

Without the foundation of the classical strict rituals and pujas undertaken to ensure the earlier stages and restrain the sādhaka’s senses and mind,and with such unpreparedness sadhakas sit for japa and are surprised when the japa is not fruitful or they face adverse reactions.

My personal feeling is that people who naturally have a good practice of meditation under their belt [that can dispel the mind’s chattering](https://eye-of-the-storm.ca/2022/11/05/the-eye-of-the-storm/) will find it easier to add power to their japa.
