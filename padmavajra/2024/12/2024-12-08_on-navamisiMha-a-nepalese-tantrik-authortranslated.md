On Navamīsiṃha a Nepalese tantrik author(translated from Dr Madhav Lamicchane’s introduction to Caṇḍī-bhakti-vinodinī)

Navamīsiṃha’s full name was Navamīsiṃha Bhaṇḍel. He was from the Newari community that is known nowadays as Rajbhandari(which in Nepalbhasa is called Bhanī as well).Strong proofs for his exact date of birth are not available but it is surmised to be somewhere between 1704-1707 BS(1647-1650AD) as surmised by Vidyanath Upadhyay Bhatta in his edition of his work Tantracintāmaṇī . He was born in the locality of Naghal tole on a rāma navamī ,hence was called Navamīsiṃha. In 1752BS(1695AD) we see that he was in the post of the mahāmātya of the then king of Kathmandu,who by then was Bhupalendra Malla.He was an important courtier in the court of Bhaskaramalla as well. He passed away at 1760BS(1703AD). He was famed for his sādhanā and his tāntrika vidvattā ,and he composed a number of tantrik works listed below
