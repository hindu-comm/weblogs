Prayogas of Batuka Bhairava

Nibandhas like Bṛhat Tantrasāra or Īśānaśivagurudeva paddhati view Baṭukabhairava as mainly a kṣetrapāla who is offered balis to, however He’s a deity with much more wider range. These are notes from Rudradev Tripathi’s book who cites a Bhairava tantra (about prayogas of His famous 108 nāma stotra/nāmāvalī)

- Dhanaprāpti
- Iṣṭasiddhiprāpti
- Freedom from debts
- Sarvasiddhi
- Saving from great dangers
- Combination with Durgā Saptashati: Another genre of Batuka aṣtottara
  prayogas. Maithilis use a special combination for fulfillment of all
  desires. - Kramas of pāṭha for various purposes

Needless to say, all these need upadeśa and subsequent anuṣṭhāna/puraścaraṇa of the Batuka mūlamantras from a living guru.
