Guruvarāha (actually a Śivaliṅga next to a broken Varāha mūrti)

There was also new shrines of Śanideva(very popular) and Gaṅeśa(listed as to be visited first in a new signboard) which seemed to be much more recent than the paurāṅika attestations and do not seem to be rebuildings of old structures in the way these structures of Hari,Śrī,Indra and Śiva and Sūrya are. Indra is worshipped in a Śivaliṅga. This kṣetra is near the saṅgama of the Kokā and Kośi rivers in Sunsari district, Nepal.

The main Varāha shrine, whose image I have not taken, has 4 Varāhas. The main Varāha is a structure somewhat superficially akin to a South Indian Brindavana kept covered in leaves.
