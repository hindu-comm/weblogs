This text does not seem to be the popular text beloved by Gauḍīya
vaiṣṇavas,but a(presumably lost) text quoted by Parāśara Bhaṭṭar,hence
it is of interest to me(and looking at the Catalogue edited by Sadhu
Parampurushdas,the other Brahma-saṃhitā seems to be available only in
unpublished manuscript fragments featuring about matters relating to
prāyaścitta and utsavas)

hṛt-padma karṇikāntasthaḥ puruṣaḥ sarvatomukhaḥ\|  
sarvajñaḥ sarvagaḥ sarvaḥ sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati\|\|  
tasmāt tu paramaṃ sūkṣmam ākāśam bhāti nirmalam\|  
śuddha-sphaṭikā-saṇkāśaṃ nirvāṇaṃ paramam padam\|  
tatpadam prāpya tattvajñāḥ mucyante tu śubhāśubhāt\|\|  
trasareṇu-pramāṇāste raśmikoṭi vibhuṣitāḥ\|  
bhūyaste naiva jāyante na līyante ca te kvacit\|\|
