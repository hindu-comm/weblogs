Low-hanging fruit

In *The Great Stagnation*, Tyler Cowen discusses a real problem – a
slowdown in technical innovation, with slow economic growth as a
consequence..  I think his perspective is limited, since he doesn’t
know much about the inward nature of innovation. He is kind enough to
make absolutely clear how little he knows by mentioning Tang and Teflon
as spinoffs of the space program, which is of course wrong. It is
unfair to emphasize this too strongly, since hardly anybody in public
life knows jack shit about technology and invention. Try to think of a
pundit with a patent.

Anyhow, it strikes me that a certain amount of knowledge may lead to
useful insights. In particular, it may help us find low-hanging-fruit,
technical innovations that are tasty and relatively easy – the sort of
thing that seems obvious after someone thinks of it.

If we look at cases where an innovation or discovery was possible – even
easy – for a long time before it was actually developed, we might be
able to find patterns that would help us detect the low-hanging fruit
dangling right in front of us today.

For now, one example. We know that gastric and duodenal ulcer, and most
cases of stomach cancer, are caused by an infectious organism,
*helicobacter pylori.* It apparently causes amnesia as well. This
organism was first seen in 1875 – nobody paid any attention.

Letulle showed that it induced gastritis in guinea pigs, 1888. Walery
Jaworski rediscovered it in 1889, and suspected that it might cause
gastric disease. Nobody paid any attention. Krienitz associated it with
gastric cancer in 1906. Who cares?

Around 1940, some American researchers rediscovered it, found it more
common in ulcerated stomachs, and published their results. Some of
them thought that this might be the cause of ulcers – but Palmer, a
famous pathologist, couldn’t find it when he looked in the early 50s,
so it officially disappeared again. He had used the wrong stain. John
Lykoudis, a Greek country doctor noticed that a heavy dose of
antibiotics coincided with his ulcer’s disappearance, and started
treating patients with antibiotics – successfully. He tried to
interest pharmaceutical companies – wrote to Geigy, Hoechst, Bayer,
etc. No joy. JAMA rejected his article. The local medical society
referred him for disciplinary action and fined him

The Chinese noticed that antibiotics could cure ulcers in the early 70s,
but they were Commies, so it didn’t count.

Think about it: peptic and duodenal ulcer were fairly common, and so
were effective antibiotics, starting in the mid-40s. . Every internist
in the world – every surgeon – every GP was accidentally curing ulcers
– not just one or twice, but again and again. For decades. Almost none
of them noticed it, even though it was happening over and over, right in
front of their eyes. Those who did notice were ignored until the
mid-80s, when Robin Warren and Barry Marshall finally made the discovery
stick. Even then, it took something like 10 years for antibiotic
treatment of ulcers to become common, even though it was cheap and
effective. Or perhaps because it was cheap and effective.

This illustrates an important point: doctors are lousy scientists, lousy
researchers. They’re memorizers, not puzzle solvers. Considering that
Western medicine was an ineffective pseudoscience – actually, closer to
a malignant pseudoscience – for its first two thousand years, we
shouldn’t be surprised. Since we’re looking for low-hanging fruit,
this is good news. It means that the great discoveries in medicine are
probably not mined out. From our point of view, past incompetence
predicts future progress. The worse, the better!
