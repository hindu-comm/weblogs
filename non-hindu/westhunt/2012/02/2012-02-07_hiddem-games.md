Hidden Games



There is no single human nature. This is obvious enough – people vary
strongly in their psychology and behavior. The differences show up early
in life and don’t seem to be affected much by parental rearing style.
It would be nice to understand more about the ultimate causes of
variation in human personality, partly because of practical
implications, mostly because we find ourselves very interesting.

To some extent, the ultimate source must be forces other than natural
selection: mutational pressure, infectious disease, and new
environmental insults. Mutations happen, viruses get into the brain,
you may even have a steel rod fired through your skull, like Phineas
Gage. Such things can affect your personality. In general, one would
expect that these are the causes behind obviously maladaptive behavioral
syndromes, like homosexuality and schizophrenia.

Most human behavior is universal and adaptive, or used to be in past
environments . We eat when we’re hungry, fear spiders and snakes, love
our children – these essentially universal behaviors are the products of
natural selection. Behavioral patterns of this sort exist because they
have worked over the long haul, worked in the sense that their bearers
left descendants. Such patterns can be thought of as strategies –
patterns or rules of conduct that, on average, led to reproductive
success in the human past.

But to what extent is variation in human behavior adaptive? Why
shouldn’t there be a single best strategy? Often there is, but not
always. It depends on whether the payoff of a particular course of
action is frequency-dependent – in other words, depends on what other
individuals do. Running from a forest fire pays off whether anyone
else runs or not, but the payoff of running for tribal chief decreases
as the number of candidates increases. If everyone is passive (a
‘dove’), aggressive individuals (‘hawks’) prospers, but as hawks becomes
more common, they increasingly run into and fight other hawks, so their
payoff decreases. If the cost of fighting among hawks are high enough,
the equilibrium solution is a mixed state consisting of both hawks and
doves. Thus there is no single best solution, no single optimal
behavior – this is often the case with social interactions.

The next question is whether adaptive variation in behavior/personality
is fixed or flexible, heritable or not. In other species, we see
both. Sometimes an individual can pick one or another life strategy
based on exterior clues. If a female bee larvae is fed royal jelly, she
becomes a queen, otherwise she becomes a sterile worker. The
capability to assume those different roles is adaptive and presumably a
result of natural selection, but it is not noticeably heritable, because
*all* females bees have it. In other cases, like those pesky fire ants
that exhibit single-queen and Los Angeles-style multi-queen colonies,
the two morphs are determined by the two alleles of a single gene, and
the behavior difference is heritable as all get out – and also shaped
by natural selection.

Since we are arguably a lot smarter than ants or bees, you might think
that most adaptive personality variation in humans would be learned (a
response to exterior cues) rather than heritable. Maybe some is, but
much variation looks heritable. People don’t seem to learn to be
aggressive or meek – they just are, and in those tendencies resemble
their biological parents. I wish I (or anyone else) understood better
why this is so, but there are some notions floating around that may
explain it. One is that jacks of all trades are masters of none: if you
play the same role all the time, you’ll be better at it than someone
who keep switching personalities. It could be the case that such
switching is physiologically difficult and/or expensive. And in at
least some cases, being predictable has social value. Someone who is
known to be implacably aggressive will win at ‘chicken’. Being known as
the sort of guy who would rush into a burning building to save ugly
strangers may pay off, even though actually running into that blaze
does not.  
Also, if a particular role or personality type only became viable
recently – say, 20,000 years ago – a mutation that induces that
personality will spread. Initially it will not be part of some
super-flexible system; the required modifier genes, that would turn
those tendencies on when they pay and off when they don’t, would take
a long time to evolve.

hn Tooby and Leda Cosmides, leading evolutionary psychology mavens, have
argued strongly against the possibility of heritable, adaptive
behavioral variation in humans. In fact their arguments imply that
no such thing should exist in any species, and since we’ve found
genetic morphs in lizards, birds, crustaceans, ants, and butterflies,
it’s safe to say that John and Leda are wrong on this. But at least one
of their arguments is interesting: they argue that adaptations,
including behavioral adaptations, are usually generated by complex,
co-adapted sets of genes (true), and that such gene complexes would be
broken up by sexual reproduction (also true): even if Dad had a set of
alleles that made him a natural blacksmith or tap dancer, his kids
would never inherit that whole set and the talent should disappear. I
think they’re on to something with this argument, because it seems that
in a significant numbers of cases, these genetic morphs are determined
by a single gene: different alleles of that gene specify different
morphs. Maybe the heritable variant is in some way a simple trait: I can
imagine a number of ways in which that could work. For example, what if
simply losing a particular complex adaptation is adaptive when rare? I
can easily believe that a complex behavioral adaptation could be stopped
cold by a single mutation. Or, for that matter, what if greatly
intensifying a particular behavior or drive – turning up the volume knob
– was adaptive when rare? Can I imagine a simple mutation that turns up
the volume in some way? Surely. And, of course, such simple initial
changes can be gradually refined by natural selection.

People underestimate the information that can be packed into a single
protein. A protein 200 amino acids long could express (21)\*\*200
difference sequences: that’s a lot of possible messages. 21 instead of
20, because of seleno-cysteine. I’m not even counting the impact of
sequence variation in the promoter region.

There is another way in which a whole different life-strategy can be
packed into a single variant allele: the gene can act as a switch. The
sex-determining gene SRY is the best example of this. There are many
genes that are fully expressed only in one sex while existing (of
course) in both. Modifier genes sense the state of the switch and turn
other genes on and off accordingly. Every guy has the necessary genes
for a uterus, but they just sit there, waiting for a chance to show
their stuff in a female descendant. The same thing could happen with
morphs: probably does happen. It would be interesting to check for
genes that are highly expressed in the single-queen fire ant morph but
not in the multi-queen morph. There has been plenty of time for this to
happen, since the polymorphism is millions of years old and predates
the species.  
This kind of game-theoretic genetic variation, driving distinct
behavioral strategies, can have some really odd properties. For one
thing, there can be more than one possible stable mix of behavioral
types even in identical ecological situations. It’s a bit like dropping
a marble onto a hilly landscape with many unconnected valleys – it will
roll to the bottom of some valley, but initial conditions determine
*which* valley. Small perturbations will not knock the marble out of the
valley it lands in. In the same way, two human populations could fall
into different states, different stable mixes of behavioral traits, for
no reason at all other than chance and then stay there indefinitely.
Populations are even more likely to fall into qualitatively different
stable states when the ecological situations are significantly
different.  
In some cases, the states are not even time-stable. There could be
periodic oscillations. Consider those crazy cichlids. There is a kind
of cichlid in Lake Tanganyika that lives by eating the scales of larger
fish. It attacks by swimming up from behind and snatching a scale or
two from the side of its prey. Its mouth is twisted to the side, which
aids in this specialized form of attack. Some individuals have mouths
twisted to the right ( right-handed fish) and others are left-handed.
Right-handers attack their prey from the left and left-handers from the
right. Prey do their best to avoid these attacks, but they cannot be
vigilant simultaneously against attacks from the left and from the
right. The handedness of the scale-eating cichlids is heritable and can
evolve, as ids the tendency of other fish to be protect their left or
their right sides. When most fish are defending against right-handed
scale-eaters, southpaws have an advantage, and vice versa. It appears
that these two forms cycle over time, never reaching an equilibrium.

Barry Sinervo’s lizards have three male morphs: aggressive orange males
that dominate blue males but that cannot compete with yellow males that
imitate females – yellow males that are successfully kept out by
territorial blue males. Scissors, paper, rock – but there is more since
the same alleles in females results in r-females that lay many small
eggs and k-females that lay a few large eggs. Not too far away, the
same species has only one male morph, the blues: either by chance or
because of a different ecological situation, the species has fallen
into an entirely different societal pattern.

What this means, think, is that it is entirely possible that human
societies fall into fundamentally different patterns because of
genetic influences on behavior that are best understood via evolutionary
game theory. Sometimes one population might have a psychological type
that doesn’t exist at all in another society, or the distribution
could be substantially different. Sometimes these different social
patterns will be predictable results of different ecological
situations, sometimes the purest kind of chance. Sometimes the internal
dynamics of these genetic systems will produce oscillatory (or chaotic!)
changes in gene frequencies over time, which means changes in behavior
and personality over time. In some cases, these internal genetic
dynamics may be the fundamental reason for the rise and fall of
empires. Societies in one stable distribution, in a particular
psychological/behavioral/life history ESS, may simply be unable to
replicate some of the institutions found in peoples in a different ESS.

Evolutionary forces themselves vary according to what ESS you’re in.
Which ESS you’re in may be the most fundamentalethnic fact, and explain
the most profound ethnic behavioral differences

Look, everyone is always looking for the secret principles that
underlie human society and history, some algebra that takes mounds of
historical and archaeological data – the stuff that happens – and
explains it in some compact way, lets us *understand* it, just as
continental drift made a comprehensible story out of geology. On second
thought, ‘everyone’ mean that smallish fraction of researchers that are
slaves of curiosity…

This approach isn’t going to explain everything – nothing will. But it
might explain a lot, which would make it a hell of a lot more valuable
than modern sociology or cultural anthropology. I would hope that an
analysis of this sort might help explain fundamental long-term flavor
difference between different human societies, differences in
life-history strategies especially (dads versus cads, etc). If we get
particularly lucky, maybe we’ll have some notions of why the Mayans got
bored with civilization, why Chinese kids are passive at birth while
European and African kids are feisty. We’ll see.

Of course we could be wrong. It’s going to have be tested and checked:
it’s not magic. It is based on the realization that the sort of morphs
and game-theoretic balances we see in some nonhuman species are if
anything more likely to occur in humans, because our societies are so
complex, because the effectiveness of a course of action so often
depends on the psychologies of other individuals – that and the obvious
fact that people are not the same everywhere.
