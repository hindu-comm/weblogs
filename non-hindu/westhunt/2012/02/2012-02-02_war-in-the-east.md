War in the East

The books generally say that biological warfare is ineffective, but then
they would say that, wouldn’t they? There is reason to think it has
worked, and it may have made a difference.

Once upon a time, it was spring 1942, and the Germans were on a roll.
Timoshenko had attacked from an already-established bridgehead across
the Donets (the Izium salient) with about 750,000 men. He made a bad
choice, since the Germans had already begun concentrating their forces
for a planned southern offensive. After some initial Soviet gains, the
Germans brought in Luftwaffe reinforcements and achieved air
superiority. The 1st Panzer army counterattacked and cut off much of the
Russian forces, who lost a quarter of a million prisoners (according to
Beevor), many dead and wounded, and most of their armor. There was a
huge hole in the front, and the Germans advanced towards Stalingrad.

We know of course that this offensive eventually turned into a disaster
in which the German Sixth Army was lost. But nobody knew that *then*.
The Germans were moving forward with little to stop them: they were
*scary* SOBs. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. The Soviet
leadership was frightened, enough so that they sent out a general
backs-to-the-wall, no-retreat order that told the real scale of
losses. That was the Soviet mood in the summer of 42.

That’s the historical background. Now for the clues. First, Ken Alibek
was a bioweapons scientist back in the USSR. In his book, *Biohazard*,
he tells how, as a student, he was given the assignment of explaining
a mysterious pattern of tularemia epidemics back in the war. To him, it
looked artificial, whereupon his instructor said something to the effect
of “you never thought that, you never said that. Do you want a job?”
Second, Antony Beevor mentions the mysteriously poor health of German
troops at Stalingrad – well before being surrounded (p210-211). Third,
the fact that there were large tularemia epidemics in the Soviet Union
during the war – particularly in the ‘oblasts temporarily occupied by
the Fascist invaders’, described in *History and Incidence of Tularemia
in the Soviet Union*, by Robert Pollitzer.

Fourth, personal communications from a friend who once worked at Los
Alamos. Back in the 90’s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, there was
a time when you could hire a whole team of decent ex-Soviet physicists
for the price of a single American. My friend was having a drink with
one of his Russian contractors, son of a famous ace, who started talking
about how his dad had dropped tularemia here, here, and here near
Leningrad (sketching it out on a napkin) during the Great Patriotic War.
Not that many people spontaneously bring up stories like that in dinner
conversation…

Fifth, the huge Soviet investment in biowarfare throughout the Cold War
is a hint: they really, truly, believed in it, and what better reason
could there be than decisive past successes? In much the same way, our
lavish funding of the NSA strongly suggested that cryptanalysis and
sigint must have paid off handsomely for the Allies in WWII – far more
so than publicly acknowledged, until the revelations about Enigma in the
1970s and later.

We know that tularemia is an effective biological agent: many countries
have worked with it, including the Soviet Union. If the Russians had
had this capability in the summer of ’42 (and they had sufficient
technology: basically just fermentation) , it is hard to imagine them
*not* using it. I mean, we’re talking about Stalin. You think he had
moral qualms? But we too would have used germ warfare if our situation
had been desperate.

In my picture, it probably wasn’t used in 1941 because of surprise, the
fast-moving front, crushing German air superiority (after the initial
airfield strikes), and winter. I think that the Soviets were probably
hesitant in 1942, since detection would have probably led to German
efforts along the same lines, doubly dangerous because Germany was the
world leader in bacteriology in those days, and because Moscow was
within easy reach of the Luftwaffe. Tularemia, though, is easy to
misdiagnose, and the Germans didn’t have much experience with it.
Moreover, Germans in Stalingrad never had a chance to be fully debriefed
back in Germany. Risky in the long run, but you first have to survive
in the short run.

Maybe those PO-2s carried something special on their nuisance night
raids.

I could be wrong, but it looks likely, and it’s what should have
happened. If biological warfare played a role in the Stalingrad
campaign, it may have changed history.
