Lewontin’s argument

Richard Lewontin argued that since most (> 85%) genetic variation in
humans is within-group, rather than between groups, human populations
can’t be very different. Of course, if this argument is valid, it should
apply to any genetically determined trait. Thus the variation in skin
color within a population should be larger than the skin color
differences between populations – except that it’s not. The difference
in skin color between Europeans and Pygmies is large, so large that
there is no overlap at all. No European is as dark as the lightest
Pygmy (discounting rare cases of albinism).

As it happens, we now know quite a lot about the genetic architecture of
skin color. It is somewhat unusual, in that a handful of alleles shaped
by recent selection account for light skin in Europeans and Asia
(different alleles in Asia than in Europe). So, is skin color an
exception? Maybe Lewontin’s argument works on highly polygenic traits
like height, that are influenced by many alleles of small effect. But
no! Pygmies are notoriously short, while Bantus are about the same
height as Europeans. We know that in a mixed population (part-Pygmy and
part-Bantu) height goes up with the percentage of Bantu ancestry. So,
there is a big, non-environmental difference in height (several standard
deviations), even though height (itself highly heritable) is influenced
by many genes of small effect.

So Lewontin’s argument does not work. You can’t predict group
differences in trait values from the distribution of genetic variation –
except in the limiting case where *all* of the variation is
within-group, which means that the two populations are genetically
identical. You know you can’t apply it to other traits, whether they
are influenced by a few genes or by many. It’s not essential to know
\_why\_ it doesn’t work – the mere fact that its predictions don’t come
true is reason enough to discard it.

We do know why, though. Selection generates correlated genetic
differences. Selection for increased height causes changes in the
frequency of many alleles, in principle at all loci that influence
height, although that is still a small subset of the genome.  What
matter is the difference in that subset: the overall distribution of
genetic variation tells you nothing. Moreover, imagine that in the
ancestral population, there were two alleles for each of those loci – a
short allele with a frequency of 0.7 and a tall allele with a frequency
of 0.3. Suppose that after selection for height, the frequency of each
short allele was 0.3 and the frequency of the tall allele was 0.7.
This could significantly increase height. In that subset of the genome,
about 85% of the variation between those two population is within-group
while 15% is between-group.
