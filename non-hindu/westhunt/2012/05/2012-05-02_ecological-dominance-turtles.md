Ecological dominance: turtles

Nowadays, humans aren’t much concerned about being devoured. We may
have to worry about blowing ourselves up, or being blotted out by an
asteroid strike, but we don’t worry much about lions and tigers and
bears.  
But it was not always thus.

Three million years ago, we were more prey than predator. Africa was
predator-rich, more so than anywhere today, with familiar beasties such
as leopards, lions, and hyenas, but also bears, three kinds of
saber-toothed cats, and giant otters. Judging from the chewing marks and
punctures in *australopithecus* skulls, leopards were the biggest
threat.

Something like two and half million years ago, we began to turn the the
tables. The first sign of our new status was the disappearance of
Africa’s giant tortoises. Conventional predators just couldn’t get
through their shells, but we could, presumably by  
throwing or dropping rocks.

First, we drove them extinct in Africa. Next, *homo erectus* expanded
out of Africa about two million years ago and wiped out the giant
tortoises of India and Indonesia. Later, after modern humans developed
boats/rafts and Arctic survival techniques, we eliminated the tortoises
of Australia and the Americas. In recent millennia, better navigation
led to turtle massacres in Madagascar and other islands.

Today giant tortoises are only found in out-of-the-way places like
Aldabra and the Galapagos Islands – and we nearly killed *them* off.

Man took his first step towards ecological dominance on the back of a
giant turtle.

The question is, do we have to worry about payback?
