Unwilding America

Before the Amerindians arrived, North America had much more varied (and
dangerous) wildlife than it does today: particularly when it comes to
large animals, the megafauna. Today, or for that matter during colonial
times. there are only a few dangerous creatures around: grizzly bears,
black bears, polar bears, and a few poisonous snakes. Mountain lions
attack people, but rarely. I suppose some people die from drunkenly
running their pickup into a buck on a country road.

Back in the Pleistocene, life was more exciting. You had to worry about
really potent predators like dire wolves, sabertooth cats, lions, and
short-faced bears. There were also plenty of giant herbivores that would
have been dangerous, ranging from mammoths to ground sloths. In
general, more like Africa today, a place where people who fall asleep
walking home from the beer joint in the next village have their faces
eaten by hyenas.

Paul Martin, who did excellent work in showing that Quaternary
extinctions were caused by human hunters, felt that we should do our
best to recreate those extinct faunas in North America, by introducing
wild horses, camels, elephants, tigers, and such to the great plains.
I don’t think he ever bothered to explain why anyone would want to do
this. To him, it was obvious. Not to me.

A related concept, the Wildlands Project, was put forth almost 20 years
ago. Loons are still pushing it.  The idea is that many species,
especially predators, can only survive in the long term if they have
much more space than they do currently. So the people backing the
Wildlands project want to expel humans from as much as half of the
continent. Some big names such as Paul Ehrlich and E. O. Wilson have
endorsed this. Of course, they’re all mad as hatters.

First question is why anyone would want to infest the nation with
maneaters? Right now, in most of the country, you don’t have to worry
about your kids being eaten. Why would anyone want to change that?
They’d have to be implacably hostile to the human race. And of course,
they are. Personally, reading the paper in the morning, I sometimes get
sick of being overly involved with mankind (Father slays Family of Five
! Millions Die in Indian Famine !) , but I’m not willing to go that far.
Second, why would anyone think they could get away with this? You’d
have to be stupid as well as crazy. Even with creeping Pinkerization,
there are still an awful lot of rednecks with rifles.

Sometimes it is good to be reminded just how far around the bend our
thought-leaders are.

I argue that cleansing the land of most of the creatures that were
likely to squash or devour us was a good thing. I prefer farms and
ranches to a howling wilderness. The next time you see an Indian,
remember what his ancestors did to make your children safe, and buy him
a drink.
