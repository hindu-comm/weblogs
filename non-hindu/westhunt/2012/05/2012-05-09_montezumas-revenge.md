Montezuma’s Revenge

Everybody knows that the Amerindians were devastated by new infectious
diseases after Columbus discovered America and made it stick.
Smallpox, falciparum malaria, yellow fever, bubonic plague, cholera,
measles, whooping cough, etc : by some estimates, the Amerindian
population dropped by about 90%, worse than the Black Plague, which
only killed off half of Europe. Naturally, you wonder what ailments
the Americas exported to the rest of the world.

We know of two for sure. First, syphilis: the first known epidemic
was in 1495, in Naples, during a French invasion. By 1520 it had
reached Africa and China.

From the timing of the first epidemic, and the apparent newness of the
disease, many have suspected that it was an import from the New World.
Some, like Bartolome de las Casas, had direct knowledge: Las Casas was
in Seville in 1493, his father and uncle sailed with Columbus on the
second voyage, and he himself traveled to the New World in 1502, where
he spent most of the rest of his life working with the Amerindians.
Ruiz Diaz de Isla, a Spanish physician, reported treating some of
Columbus’s crew for syphilis, and that he had observed its rapid spread
in Barcelona.

I have seen someone object to this scenario, on the grounds that the two
years after Columbus’s return surely couldn’t have been long enough to
generate a major outbreak. I think maybe that guy doesn’t get out
much. It has always looked plausible, considering paleopathological
evidence (bone changes) and the timing of the first epidemic. Recent
analysis shows that some American strains of pinta (a treponemal skin
disease) are genetically closest to the venereal strains.  I’d say the
Colombian theory is pretty well established, at this point.

Interestingly, before the genetic evidence, this was one of the
longest-running disputes among historians. As far as I can tell, part
of the problem was (and is) that many in the social sciences routinely
apply Ockham’s razor in reverse. Simple explanations are bad, even when
they fit all the facts.  You see this in medicine, too.

The story of tungiasis, chigger flea infestation, is simpler and
clearer. Female chigger fleas burrow into the skin (often the big toe)
and start releasing eggs, which can lead to infection, sometimes even
to gangrene. It looks as if they originated in the West Indies, and
were inadvertently spread to the mainland by the Spanish. Tungiasis
hit the crew of the Santa Maria. Much later, the chigger flea was
introduced to Africa, carried in ballast by a ship from Brazil: the
Thomas Mitchell, in 1873. It spread all through tropical Africa, and
made it to India and Pakistan in 1899. It causes quite a bit of trouble
even today, particularly in poor areas – specifically, people without
shoes.

There are two other diseases that are suspected of originating in the
Americas. The first is typhus, gaol fever, caused by a Rickettsial
organism and usually spread by lice. Sometimes it recurs after many
years, in a mild form called Brill’s disease, rather like chickenpox
and shingles. This means that typhus is always waiting in the wings:
if the world gets sufficiently messed up, it will reappear.

Typhus shows up most often in war, usually in cool countries. There is
a claim that there was a clear epidemic in Granada in 1489, which would
definitely predate Columbus, but descriptions of disease symptoms by
premodern physicians are amazingly unreliable. The first really
reliable description seems to have been by Fracastoro, in 1546
(according to Hans Zinsser in *Rats, Lice, and History*). The key hint
is the existence of a very closely related organism in American flying
squirrels.

Thinking about it, I have the impression that the legions of the Roman
Republic didn’t have high casualties due to infectious disease, while
that was the dominant cause of death in more recent European armies, up
until the 20tth century. If smallpox, measles, syphilis, bubonic
plague, perhaps typhus, simply hadn’t arrived yet, this makes sense.
Falciparum malaria wasn’t much of a factor in northern Italy until
Imperial times…

The second possibly American disease is rheumatoid arthritis. We don’t
even know that it has an infectious cause – but we do know that it
causes characteristic skeletal changes, and that no clear-cut
pre-Columbian rheumatoid skeletons are known from the Old World, while a
number have been found in the lower South. To me, this makes some
infectious cause seem likely: it would very much be worth following this
up with the latest molecular genetic methods.

American crops like maize and potatoes more than canceled the
demographic impact of syphilis and typhus. But although the Old World
produced more dangerous pathogens than the Americas, due to size, longer
time depth of agriculture, and more domesticated animals, luck played a
role, too. Something as virulent as smallpox or falciparum malaria could
have existed in the Americas, and if it had, Europe would have been
devastated.
