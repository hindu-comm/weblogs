Platitude Storm: Race as a Social Construct

Fall term is almost upon us. I will be teaching a course on social
consequences of biological diversity, and much of it is far from
politically correct. I have been thinking that I should introduce some
material from the “race is a social construct” point of view, but
nothing I could find was serious in the sense of saying something about
data. Searching, I contacted [Jason
Antrosio](http://www.hartwick.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/social-sciences/anthropology-home/anthropology-faculty/jason-antrosio),
who writes a blog called [*Living
Anthropologically*](http://www.livinganthropologically.com). He often
writes about topics like this, or, rather, they seem to be related
insofar as I can make sense of them. He often has interesting things to
say and he mentions, in a post about the Aurora shootings, that he grew
up in a gun culture in Montana. I figure he must be all right.

He sent me a detailed reply. Apparently others had asked for the same
advice, and he posted his recommendations
[here](http://www.livinganthropologically.com/2012/07/23/teaching-race-anthropology/).
I read most of what he suggested, and I still have no idea what the
issues are or what the point of the papers is.

Here is a letter I wrote him, in the spirit of continuing our
conversation. I am posting it here, lightly edited, to try for some
feedback from our readers.

> Dear Jason:

> My view remains that there is no substance to the papers you  
> recommend, or, more precisely, that the substance is fogged by  
> gratuitous political platitudes. There are two discrete themes I  
> detect running through all of them. The first is that we must not
> use  
> the word race. The second is that biology and genetics are  
> distasteful and that they have no place in understanding human  
> differences.
>
> The denunciation of the word race is magical thinking, as if it
> makes  
> any difference to anyone or anything if I lecture about “ancestry”
> rather than  
> about “race”. They are just words. Reminds me of the time when  
> calling women “Ms” was going to end sexism.

> You quote John Relethford’s remark that race is “culturally

> The aversion to genetics and biology is another mystery. The Gravlee
