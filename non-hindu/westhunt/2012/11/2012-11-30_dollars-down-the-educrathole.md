Dollars down the Educrathole?

The internet has made teaching small involved classes a rewarding
pleasure: when an interesting issue comes up laptops fly open and we
immediately have the data we want.

Yesterday in my social issues class we were discussing per-pupil
expenditure by state in primary and secondary education. Utah is famous
for having the lowest per-pupil funding in the country. We are right
next to and similar in many ways to Wyoming, which has one of the
highest funding levels in the country. The dollars per student are
$7,200 in Utah and $18,000 in Wyoming according to this
[source](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=5199).
Caution is always in order, of course, but these numbers are in broad
agreement with other sources and other years.

What does Wyoming get for the extra $11,000 per student? A quick assay
is to look at NAEP scores. Here are eighth grade math scores for white
students over the last two decades:

A quick look shows that Wyoming is getting nothing at all for their
extra $11,000. The results for students identified as hispanic are
grounds for a tad of optimism: Wyoming hispanics consistently outperform
Utah Hispanics by 10 to 15 points, but we have to know more about the
history and demography of the two hispanic populations, those of Utah
and Wyoming, before we attribute the differences to $11,000 per student.

What am I missing here?
