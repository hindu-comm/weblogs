Pearls from Lewontin

In a review in the NYRoB, Richard Lewontin says

“The other exception to random inheritance is not in the chromosomes,
but in cellular particles called ribosomes that contain not DNA but a
related molecule, RNA, which has heritable variation and is of basic
importance to cell metabolism and the synthesis of proteins. Although
the cells of both sexes have ribosomes, they are inherited exclusively
through their incorporation in the mother’s egg cell rather than
through the father’s sperm. Our ribosomes, then, provide us, both male
and female, with a record of our maternal ancestry, uncontaminated by
their male partners. ”

I didn’t know that.

He also says: ”The Y chromosome carries very few genes. We know this to
be true because, very rarely, an individual is born having received, as
usual, one X chromosome from the female parent but, abnormally, neither
an additional X chromosome nor a Y chromosome from the male parent. This
individual, called an “XO” type, is a sterile female but otherwise is
normal. ”

I grew up with a class mate who had Turner syndrome, XO. That’s not the
impression I got, but people at Harvard evidently know a lot of things
that I don’t.
