Thick and thin

There is a spectrum of problem-solving, ranging from, at one extreme,
simplicity and clear chains of logical reasoning (sometimes long
chains) and, at the other, building a picture by sifting through a vast
mass of evidence of varying quality. I will give some examples. Just
the other day, when I was conferring, conversing and otherwise
hobnobbing with my fellow physicists, I mentioned high-altitude
lighting, sprites and elves and blue jets. I said that you could think
of a thundercloud as a vertical dipole, with an electric field that
decreased as the cube of altitude, while the breakdown voltage varied
with air pressure, which declines exponentially with altitude. At which
point the prof I was talking to said ” and so the curves must cross!”.
That’s how physicists think, and it can be very effective. The amount of
information required to solve the problem is not very large. I call this
a ‘thin’ problem’.

At the other extreme, consider Darwin gathering and pondering on a vast
amount of natural-history information, eventually coming up with natural
selection as the explanation. Some of the information in the
literature wasn’t correct, and much key information that would have
greatly aided his quest, such as basic genetics, was still unknown.
That didn’t stop him, anymore than not knowing the *cause* of
continental drift stopped Wegener.

In another example at the messy end of the spectrum, Joe Rochefort,
running Hypo in the spring of 1942, needed to figure out Japanese
plans. He had an an ever-growing mass of Japanese radio intercepts, some
of which were partially decrypted – say, one word of five, with luck.
He had data from radio direction-finding; his people were beginning to
be able to recognize particular Japanese radio operators by their
‘fist’. He’d studied in Japan, knew the Japanese well. He had plenty
of Navy experience – knew what was possible. I would call this a classic
‘thick’ problem, one in which an analyst needs to deal with an enormous
amount of data of varying quality. Being smart is necessary but not
sufficient: you also need to know lots of stuff.

At this point he was utterly saturated with information about the
Japanese Navy. He’d been living and breathing JN-25 for months. The
Japanese were aimed somewhere, that somewhere designated by an
untranslated codegroup – ‘AF’. Rochefort thought it meant Midway, based
on many clues, plausibility, etc. OP-20-G, back in Washington, thought
otherwise. They thought the main attack might be against Alaska, or Port
Moresby, or even the West Coast.

Nimitz believed Rochefort – who was correct. Because of that, we
managed to prevail at Midway, losing one carrier and one destroyer while
the the Japanese lost four carriers and a heavy cruiser\*. As so often
happens, OP-20-G won the bureaucratic war: Rochefort embarrassed them
by proving them wrong, and they kicked him out of Hawaii, assigning him
to a floating drydock.

The usual explanation of Joe Rochefort’s fall argues that John Redman’s
( head of OP-20-G, the Navy’s main signals intelligence and
cryptanalysis group) geographical proximity to Navy headquarters was a
key factor in winning the bureaucratic struggle, along with his
brother’s influence (Rear Admiral Joseph Redman). That and being a
shameless liar.

Personally, I wonder if part of the problem is the great difficulty of
explaining the analysis of a thick problem to someone without a similar
depth of knowledge. At best, they believe you because you’ve been
right in the past. Or, sometimes, once you have developed the answer,
there is a ‘thin’ way of confirming your answer – as when Rochefort took
Jasper Holmes’s suggestion and had Midway broadcast an uncoded complaint
about the failure of their distillation system – soon followed by a
Japanese report that ‘AF’ was short of water.

Most problems in the social sciences are ‘thick’, and unfortunately,
almost all of the researchers are as well. There are a lot more Redmans
than Rocheforts.
