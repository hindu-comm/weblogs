Altered States

I have never been particularly interested in seeking out altered states
of consciousness: generally I like being as sober as possible – knurd,
even. But sometimes, an altered state finds you.

I was messing around in the back yard, trying to get past the rosebushes
to pick some cherries, when I was bitten by a spider. At least I think
it was a spider – I never saw the damn thing. After a bit a spot on my
chest began to hurt like hell, and it kept on doing so for more than a
week. It didn’t want to heal, either – it just kept scabbing over.

By itself, pain gets boring. But there was another effect, which was
interesting. I would feel as if I’d just awakened on a crisp fall day.
I felt sharp, alert, but not hyper. It came and went. Unfortunately,
the pain came and went along with it. Sharp, alert, a feeling almost
like the smell of pines – and agony. I think it’s not going to be a big
popular success.

Too bad the spider wasn’t radioactive.
