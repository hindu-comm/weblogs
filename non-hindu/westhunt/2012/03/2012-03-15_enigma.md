Enigma

The Western Allies, in World War II, ran the most successful
intelligence effort in history. They did well against the Japanese,
frequently making partial decrypts of JN-25, the main fleet code, along
with lots of useful traffic analysis, etc.  They did better still
against the Germans: most of the regime’s operational orders were sent
using the Enigma coding machine, and by 1942 the Allies were routinely
decoding three-rotor Enigma messages, used by the German Army and the
Luftwaffe, the same day. They not only knew which cards the Germans
were holding – they usually knew what the Germans were *thinking* about
those cards.

The modern consensus is that breaking Enigma shortened the war by at
least a year.

Although a number of highly-placed people knew the story, some because
they had been personally involved during WWII, the successful decryption
of Enigma was kept secret until 1974, when F. W. Winterbotham published
*The Ultra Secret*.

Most historians didn’t know about it. Without that information, the
course of World War II can’t really have made sense. Why didn’t anyone
notice?
