The Only Game in Town

Over on Discover gnxp, Victor said “As far as IQ is concerned, I find
such comparisons meaningless. An IQ test devised by members of some
African tribe is going to be very different from one devised by Western
academics. And I can guarantee that most “Caucasians” would not do very
well on such a test.”

I mention this not because it is true or sensible, but rather because it
is often said. I can hardly count the times that I have seen someone
make this argument. The person putting it forth usually thinks of it as
utterly crushing. Another related argument is that there are ‘lots of
different kinds of intelligence” – so who can say what really matters?

Well, I can. IQ, as measured by IQ scores, is a decent measure of the
cognitive skills that you need in order for technical innovation or more
routine science and engineering. It’s generally useful in modern
technical civilization. Populations with low average IQ produce very few
individuals that are good at innovation. Very few. If there were one
or a few kinds of intelligence that were not measured well by IQ tests,
but allowed people with low IQs to accomplish remarkable things – you’d
think we would notice. We know that they don’t invent railroads or
transistors or penicillin: what comparably important and useful things
have they done?

Look, if magic worked, and was the product of these other kinds of
intelligence, I’d revise my opinion. That’s why Henry should have let
the witch doctor turn him into a frog: we could have really learned
something.

Let us suppose that Victor is right, and that the typical European or
East Asian would do worse than average, if raised from babyhood among
Australian Aboriginals some 20,000 years ago. Probably no IRB would
approve this, and I hear that the Hays Office doesn’t approve of the
naked singularities required for time travel, but let us suppose it. So
what? Victor has made a prime philosophical and practical error. He is
saying that an entirely hypothetical environment, *one that does not
exist*, is comparably important with life its own self. We live here
and now, not back then, or in one of the worlds of if. In this world,
the one we actually occupy, certain traits help you succeed. IQ tests
have value in measuring a certain subset of those traits.

IQ pays off in technical civilization – in terms of wealth, health, and
power – and that’s the only civilization left, really. I’m not holding
my breath for the Sentinelese takeover.
