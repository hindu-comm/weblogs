Coincidence?  I think so!

The Decode study on mutation rate and paternal age found that mothers
contribute 15 new mutations, regardless of age, while men contribute
(25 + 2\*(g -20), when g is the average paternal age \[assumed to be
greater or equal to 20\]. Obviously, the number of mutations per
generation goes up as average paternal age increases. What about the
average number of mutations per year, which is a useful number for
neutral theory?

If the generation length for both sexes is equal (to g), then the
average number of mutations per year is (1/g)(15 + 25+2(g-20)) = 2,
independent of generation length. Very convenient for neutral-theory
calculations. But this cancellation is a coincidence: if number of
mutations contributed by women were higher or lower, the per-year rate
would change as the generation length changed. A big difference
between average paternal age and average maternal age can also change
the per-year mutation rate: if the average paternal age was 42 and the
average maternal age 28, the per-year mutation rate would be 2.179.
