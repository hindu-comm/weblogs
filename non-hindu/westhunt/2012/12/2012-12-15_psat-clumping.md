PSAT clumping

My middle boy, Roddy, he of mampire fame, got his PSAT score.  230
(out of 240): not bad at all. He will be a NMSQT finalist, as long as he
doesn’t burn down the school. Which is a good thing: it might help pay
for college. I was talking to the widow next door and told her
this. In the course of the conversation, I mentioned that his older
sister was also a finalist, like me, my wife, my brother, my wife’s
sister, and my wife’s brother. My younger sister was only commended –
but then she was class valedictorian, unlike me. But like my mother, my
brother, my daughter, and Roddy (probably). My oldest boy is dyslexic
and has fantastic trouble spelling, but he still managed a Regent’s
scholarship at the State U.

She said, “What’s your secret?”

And, as we all know it has to be something environmental. Has to be.
Should I spill the beans? I dunno – consider what happened to Cyprus in
Brave New World.
