Waiting for Super-Flynn

The NAEP has begun giving students vocabulary tests. New Mexico
fourth-graders came in 50th out of 50 states – although they still beat
DC. New Mexico usually does abysmally on standardized tests, but we
often have managed to score higher than Louisiana or Alabama – and now
California is now a contender for the Bottom Five.

Then there’s Mississippi, which until now had been our firewall. As far
as I know, this is the first time we’ve been the lowest-scoring state.
But not the last!

I always enjoy discussions of our educational problems. They remind me
of an important mystery in Andre Norton’s Witch World series: the
inhabitants of Estcarp (except for our half-Earthly protagonists) can’t
even think about what may lie behind the mountains to the East. It is
as if that direction does not even exist.
