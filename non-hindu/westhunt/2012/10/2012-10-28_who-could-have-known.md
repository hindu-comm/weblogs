Who could have known?

Now and then people experiment with changes in basic social
arrangements. They may institute polygamy, or start marrying their
first cousins, or worse yet their sisters. They may, as a society,
decide that their brightest young women should waste their reproductive
years on careers. Anyone who understood much about genetics would know
that those experiments were bound to have bad consequences, but back in
the past, nobody knew anything about genetics, with the possible
exception of some farmers. Of course nobody knows anything it today,
either. In fact, no popular ideology is at all based on any kind of
genetic knowledge or understanding, and some strongly oppose the actual
facts on the ground. Others simply don’t give a rat’s ass about the
long-term consequences.

But you can’t beat the facts. The advanced paternal age associated with
polygamy increases genetic load. Cousin marriage increases infant
mortality and decreases IQ. The Hapsburgs turned into a mess, the
Ptolemies went straight downhill, and King Tut had more things wrong
with him than you could shake a stick at.

History shows again and again how nature points out the folly of men.
