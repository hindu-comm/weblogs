Pre-term Births

The model that Greg is dancing around suggests (1) that there is
variation in mutation rate dependent on temperature or something
correlated with temperature, (2) higher mutation rates cause a higher
genetic burden in human populations, (3) leading to IQ reduction and
other minor dings. One interesting possible ding is premature birth,
which affects 10 to 12 percent of pregnancies among Whites and
Hispanics in America and about 18 percent of pregnancies among US
Blacks. The trio of prematurity, low birth weight, and infant mortality
is an especially conspicuous burden for the Black population.

It is easy these days to pull relevant data off the web, bearing in mind
that data quality varies a lot in unknown ways. The scatter plot below
shows average temperature by state for the US, on the x axis, and rates
of preterm birth on the y axis, for non-Hispanic Whites.

The simple correlation between temperature and prematurity is 0.55, not
bad for social science. There is no real correlation at all for the US
Black population and only an insignificant hint of one for the US
Hispanic population.

This number should not be regarded as an ordinary correlation because
there is spatial autocorrelation among the states. For example, should
Mississippabama be treated as one state or two? How long has the DNA of
people in a state been in the state? For example one suspects that much
of the White population of Florida has only arrived within the last one
or two generations. There are a lot of other ways that one could pick
at these data.

The overall pattern is roughly mirrored by state IQ estimates or their
proxies like NAEP scores, by infant mortality rates, low birth weight
rates, and so on. In color coded maps I often notice a kind of V of
lower IQ and worse health in US Whites, the base of the V in Mississippi
with the right arm extending up theAppalachians to West Virginia and
the left arm, less clearly defined, reaching to Colorado. A nice source
of such interactive maps is at this
