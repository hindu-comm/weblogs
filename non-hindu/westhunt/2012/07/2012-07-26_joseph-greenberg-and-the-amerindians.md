Joseph Greenberg and the Amerindians

Joseph Greenberg believed that the native languages of the Americas fell
into three macro-families: Eskimos-Aleut, Na-Dene (mainly the Athabaskan
languages, spoken in Western Canada and the American Southwest), and
Amerind (all of the rest). Often this theory was paired with the notion
of three separate migrations: first the Amerinds, then the Na-Dene,
then the Eskimo.

It does indeed look as if there were three separate migrations – another
gem from Reich and Patterson. The study was marred by complete
non-cooperation from Amerindians in the US, but they managed. The
Canadian Na-Dene tribe they looked at was mostly Amerind but had about
10% of the second wave. The Eskimos were about half Amerind and half
the third wave. I would guess that Na-Dene groups such as the Navaho
and Apache have a higher fraction of that second wave, because they
simply *look* more like modern East Asians, as do the Eskimo.

Both of the later waves seem to have started out settling areas in the
far North, regions that became habitable late and where settlment
required specialized techniques. Interestingly, the genetic sample from
the old Saqqaq culture in Greenland looks to be almost entirely second
wave ( 85%) – so some people linked to the Na-Dene likely occupied all
of the Arctic coast of North America before the Eskimo. Curiously, the
Eskimos don’t show a noticeable fraction of second-wave ancestry. They
must have replaced them without much admixture. Perhaps more detailed
studies will show a bit. Lesson: when one human population expands into
another, there is almost always *some* admixture (enough to transmit
adaptive alleles, certainly) but there isn’t always much. Laurent
Excoffier thinks that such events are always similar to a ‘range
expansion’ – diffusion and random mating – but that happens not to be
the case. Not when AMH met Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in Neolithic
Europe, not in the Philippines, not in the Americas.

Fairly recently, Na-Dene has been linked to a particular family of
Siberian languages, Yeniseian, using standard linguistic techniques
rather than Greenberg’s multiple comparisons approach. Of course,
Merrit Ruhlen, a student of Greenberg, had made the same connection
earlier using multiple comparisons, while Alfredo Trombetti suggested
the same thing 90 years ago.

Most linguists studying Amerindian languages disagreed with Greenberg.
They thought (and still think) that it is impossible to identify a
language macro-family that originated as much as 15,000 years ago. They
also to tend to dismiss evidence from genetics, not least because they
don’t know any.

It is conceivable that Greenberg’s method is invalid, and that it
repeatedly gave the right answer (on the three-wave settlement of the
Americas, on Dené–Yeniseian, and in his generally accepted
classification of the African languages) by chance. Maybe Joe Greenberg
was just lucky.

Certainly his critics aren’t.
