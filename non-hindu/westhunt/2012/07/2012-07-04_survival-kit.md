Survival Kit

It seems to me that people are far too casual about one of the greatest
personal threats, that of suddenly being translated into another world,
era, or alternate history. This happens all the time. You walk around
the horses in a little town near Berlin, in 1809, and you disappear
(with a popping sound). You get hit by lightning, and suddenly you find
yourself in Ostrogothic Italy or medieval Iceland. Some bruiser hits
you on the head with a crowbar, and you wake up in Arthur’s England.
While investigating reports of strange gases in an abandoned coal mine
in Pennsylvania, you fall into a kind of suspended animation for 492
years, waking to find America under the iron heel of the Air Lords of
Han. While chasing down an armed perp (again in Pennsylvania), you’re
accidentally swept up into someone’s sideways-in-time vehicle and land
in a Keystone State full of pagan Aryans in desperate need of a new
source of gunpowder.

Sometimes you don’t go alone. You and your posse might be losing to
Commies in Angola when you’re providentially scooped up by a flying
saucer in search of mercenaries. Your Yankee island, coofs and all, may
suddenly slide back to the Bronze Age. You look out the window of
Flight 33 and see brontosaurs, which can’t be good.

I don’t believe anybody can prevent these sudden translations, but we
can do a better job of readying ourselves. It should be possible to
develop a small kit that materially improves your chances in such
circumstances – whether your goal is mere survival,
introducing/saving/restarting civilization, or becoming King and/or
Warlord. More than a bug-out bag.

Looks to me as if you might want to use a kind of flow chart: figure out
key survival facts first, and only later pursue more general
investigations. Immediately check for predators, volcanism, and hostile
humans. If there are no immediate threats, you probably want to check
where – or when – you are.

The flora and fauna tell you a lot: if you see mammoths, you’re either
in the past (but not terribly far back) or you’re in a future rife with
genetic engineering. If you see several identifiable species, you can
intersect their ranges to home in on your location.

If you see a hummingbird you’re in the Americas: if you also see eastern
hemlock you’re almost certainly east of the Mississippi river.
Eucalyptus is strong sign of Australian location. And so on.

A clear night sky is damned informative. If you’re not too far in the
past or future, the stars can give you a rough date and latitude. They
could also tell you if you’re in some other local solar system: you
should carry maps giving you key altered constellations (both
hemispheres) for the 20 closest solar systems. For example, if Orion
looks like this, you’re in the Alpha Centauri system:

The Moon is a giveaway: you’d know that you were on Earth even if the
constellations were time-distorted beyond recognition. Luna can give you
some temporal info as well: if you don’t see Tycho, you’re more than
100 million years into the past. If it’s green, you’re definitely in the
future.

Knowing some very old-fashioned astronomy can be very useful when you’re
on the verge of being burnt at the stake. Learn about the Saros cycle –
predict eclipses and amaze your enemies.

We can learn from what has been found useful in past incidents of this
kind. Having some real silver money in your pocket is good – it might
let you pay for your lodgings for a week or so, while you scope out the
situation and prepare to build the world’s first still. . If you want
to introduce agriculture, carry seeds. Cortez got wheat farming in
Mexico started with three kernels found in a sack of rice from Spain –
I would suggest teff, since you can hold enough in your hand to to a sow
a field.

If you must carry a gun, bring silver bullets.

I’d include two extra pairs of glasses, so that you can break one pair
and still have fun reading up a storm, after the big nuclear war.

You’d want to be inoculated against smallpox, and bubonic plague, and
maybe some other things. Bring some antibiotics – stuff that doesn’t
require refrigeration

Maps with locations of easily exploited, highly valuable minerals, like
the beach diamonds of Namibia would be good to have. Generally, you
would make maps from thin oiled silk, like flyer’s escape maps in World
War Two. Durable, solar-powered digital devices might be better: in a
few gigs you could easily store all the best parts of western civ,
including the 1911 Britannica. You might also want to home-brew a
dosimeter out of a solar-powered digital camera and a plastic
scintillator, so you can avoid the worst-hit spots from the ancient
nuclear wars…

Of course you may land somewhere where high tech does not work. Bring a
grimoire or two in microfiche: you can find nonelectric handheld
microfiche viewers.



These notes are just a beginning. Suggestions are welcome.
