Asking the question

Sometimes simply asking the question in the first place is a key step,
even when it takes a genius to actually solve the problem. So, even
though he couldn’t calculate his way out of a paper bag, Antoine
Gombaud, Chevalier de Méré , played an important role in birthing
probability theory – by asking Pascal and Fermat to solve the the
problem of points – how to divide the stakes of an unfinished series of
games. Of course asking the right people is also part of the goodness.

Franciszek Pokorny, who headed the Polish General Staff’s Cipher bureau
after World War I, was the first to realize that cryptography and
cryptanalysis are essentially mathematical in nature – and that you
therefore want to hire mathematicians, rather than classical scholars or
members of the band of the battleship California. He recruited Marian
Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki: they weren’t considered
world-beaters by other Polish mathematicians – not like Arne Beurling –
but they broke Enigma.
