Chasing references – help!

I believe I recently saw a mention of an article about regional brain
differences in Europe, but I’m having trouble locating it. Maybe I
dreamed it?

Also, I definitely saw an article by some utter dipshit, a professor of
philosophy, about how you were genetically closer to other races than to
your own. I have to find this again. Interested also in any other
references on that particular crazy idea.
