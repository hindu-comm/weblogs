Public intellectuals, pundits, and all that

In principle, public intellectuals should have something interesting to
say, ideally not just interesting because ridiculous or incredibly
stupid. The ideal P.I. might have a special area of expertise and apply
that to current events and questions, or whatever struck his fancy.. He
might have a wide range of interests and make connections that others
can’t see. He might be smart, or independent minded, or both. It would
be nice if he had a decent predictive track record, better than a dart
board. He should be stubborn enough to resist currently fashionable
errors.

As for ideology, that’s a poor substitute for understanding how things
actually work.

In my opinion, elegant prose isn’t very important.

He probably does all this for $25 dollars a day and expenses, mostly
gasoline and whiskey. That’s about all he’s going to get, because
there’s not much demand for analysts, as opposed to cheerleaders.

If most PIs are schlockmeisters, that’s because of popular demand.
Bullshit walks.

I invite nominations: either a P.I. that is actually good-for-something
(if you can find one), or give an amusingly damning quote for one of the
vast majority of vile drones.
