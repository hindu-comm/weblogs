Saudi Modernization

There’s an effort to put Saudis to work, because of low oil prices and a
rapidly increasing population. The goal is to have Saudi Arabia
prosperous due to application of Saudi human capital, rather than just
from oil  
It won’t work. And the thing they try after that won’t work either.

P.S. at current rates of draw-down, Saudi financial assets will be
exhausted in five years.
