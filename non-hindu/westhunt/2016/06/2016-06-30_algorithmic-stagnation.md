Algorithmic stagnation

I can get as excited about an n log n solution as anyone, but I don’t
pretend to be a real expert in algorithmic analysis. But I’m interested.

One upon a time, I remember people claiming that more of the tremendous
increase in speed of computations was due to improved algorithms than
faster hardware. It wasn’t a ridiculous claim.

Moore’s law is slowing down, but surely the rate of algorithm
improvement has as well. Hard to see how you trump the FFT.
