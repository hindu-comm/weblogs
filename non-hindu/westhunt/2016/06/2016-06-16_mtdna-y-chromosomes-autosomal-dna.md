mtDNA,  Y-chromosomes, autosomal DNA

Imagine that we take men from population A, with a distinct set of
Y-chromosomes, and have them father children with women from Population
C. And their male descendants keep marrying women from population C:
eventually we have a population (D) with all Y-chromosomes originating
in population A while their mtDNA and autosomal DNA are all from
population C.

Now we take women from population B, with a distinct set of mtDNA
haplotypes. They marry guys from population D, and their descendants
continue to do so for a long time: so we eventually end up with a
population (E) all of whose Y-chromosomes come from population A, all
mtDNA from population B, all autosomal DNA from population C.
