Throwing down the gauntlet

[![grip

Razib Khan threatens to give in to
[despair](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-lack-of-progress-in-science-sex-differences/),
after hearing some dipshit sociology professor
[argue](https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Segregation-Sports-Separate-Equal/dp/1440838100/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1470114522&sr=1-1)
for the end of sex segregation in sports – not just because this dame is
nuts, but because she’s an example of the general solipsistic trend. Sex
is a social construct, race is a social construct, poop is a social
construct: wishing can make it so!

Well, despair is a sin, and solipsism isn’t that hard to defeat. People
with a fair grounding in reality are much more effective foes.

I am volunteering to do my part. If she agrees, and people put up a
reasonable purse, I am willing to arm-wrestle this young lady. And for
the loser – vae victis!
