Personnel decision

Who should be head of the FDA?

Ideally he should understand how drug development is drying up and have
some decent notions about fixing it – this is probably the biggest
current problem. He should understand big pharma’s sins and virtues. He
should not be paralyzed by some stupid ideology, or be in someone’s
pocket. And the usual – know something about navigating Congress and the
bureaucracy, not have any really hilarious personal habits involving
small woodland creatures.

Looking for names, but also qualities/experience to add to this list.
