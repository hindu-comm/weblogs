Lions, Tigers, and Bears

There’s a recent
[article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/no-proof-shooting-predators-saves-livestock)
out arguing that since there is no gold-standard , randomized controlled
study that shows that removing predators reduces livestock predation –
so we should stop killing lions, tigers, and bears. Also wolves.

I guess that’s it for everything else we do that doesn’t have that kind
of supporting evidence. No more arresting murderers!

Just kidding, of course. These guys are lying. Veeck effect, moving the
fence up and down. They should be fired – and that’s no joke.
