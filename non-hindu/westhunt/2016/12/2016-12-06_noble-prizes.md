Noble Prizes

Someday, in my copious spare time, I’m going to tabulate the  
Noble prizewinners – consisting of the people who really should have  
gotten the Nobel prizes. I would add disciplines not part of the Nobel  
prizes, such as geophysics; politely retract prizes from guys who
later  
turned out to be mistaken, like Fibiger – and of course no prize for
people  
who appropriated the work of others. So no prizes for Hewish. or  
Waksman. And, of course, one would want to go back in time well before  
Nobel. I would hope to be fair, not overly Scandi-centric like *some*
folks  
we know. And, just for fun, I would like to classify the prizes into a
few  
discovery categories. There’s the most common kind, where someone is
doing  
high-quality work in a particular area and runs into something new and  
important as a fairly natural consequence of being at the leading edge.
At  
the other end of the spectrum, you have the guy who has been struck,  
sometimes repeatedly, by an overwhelming bolt of inspiration, who does
stuff  
that maybe nobody else could.  
The only problem is that in order to do a fair job of this, one would  
have to know virtually everything. I could use some help, probably

So: Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty win the prize for
biology in 1944.
