The Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo

All too often we see large, long-lasting research efforts that never
produce, never achieve their goal.

For example, the amyloid hypothesis \[accumulation of amyloid-beta
oligomers is the cause of Alzheimers\] has been dominant for more than
20 years, and has driven development of something like 15 drugs. None of
them have worked. At the same time the well-known increased risk from
APOe4 has been almost entirely ignored, even though it ought to be a
clue to the cause.

In general, when a research effort has been spinning its wheels for a
generation or more, shouldn’t we try something different? We could at
least try putting a fraction of those research dollars into alternative
approaches that have not yet failed repeatedly.

Mostly this applies to research efforts that at least wish they were
science. ‘educational research’ is in a special class, and I hardly know
what to recommend. Most of the remedial actions that occur to me violate
one or more of the Geneva conventions.
