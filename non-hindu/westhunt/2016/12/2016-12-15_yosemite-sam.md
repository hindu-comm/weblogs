Yosemite Sam

When you grow up in a particular environment, you tend to think of it as
the default, but it ain’t necessarily so. Once you realize it doesn’t
have to be, you can end up wondering what really is normal – especially
if its a topic that people don’t discuss all that much.

One of my boys \[ Sam \] developed the ability to curse before he could
talk. He sounded a lot like Yosemite Sam: “That dirty perka shorka
bat-flattin’ portin’ filabunkabertin’, perkalooma burtin’ dirtin’
boostinattin’ bartin’ anatom, oooooooh!”. He did it when he was really
mad. I have no idea who might have set him such a bad example.

Do other toddlers do this?
