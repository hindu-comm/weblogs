Son of Edar

The EDAR V370A variant, almost fixed in northeast Asia, is known to
cause coarser hair, smaller breasts with increased branch density,
shovel-shaped incisors, more eccrine sweat glands, and changes in the
shape of the earlobe. The changes in eccrine sweat glands and the
hangey-down part of the ear have only been noticed recently.

It’s a gain-of-function mutation: you’re getting more of the effect that
EDAR normally has.

Some people have loss-of-function mutations in EDAR: hypohydrotic
extodermal dysplasia, HED. This was first identified by Charles Darwin.
In *[The Variation of Animals and Plants under
Domestication](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CFJ3VM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008CFJ3VM&linkCode=as2&tag=the10000yeaex-20),*
he noted a family in India that produced ten men in four generations,
all suffering from missing teeth, very little hair, inability to sweat,
etc.

HED patients also have messed-up fingernails and have problems with the
lacrimal glands (tear glands), the sebaceous glands, the
[Meibomian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibomian_gland) glands, and
salivary glands. Presumably you would see the opposite effects in people
with a gain-of-function mutation like EDAR V370A.

So – somebody should look for characteristic racial differences in
[tears](http://vision.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lin_2013_racial_variations_interfacial_behavior_lipid_scls1.pdf),
sebaceous glands, Meobomian glands, and salivary glands. And possibly
fingernails. They may well exist, be driven by this EDAR mutation, and
some might play a role in its selective advantage.
