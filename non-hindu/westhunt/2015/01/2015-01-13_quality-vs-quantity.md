Quality vs Quantity

Here’s a point I made in Chicago last year:

Human capital theory, as I understand it (which isn’t much), seems to
assume that differences in human capital are the product of
environmental inputs, much of those inputs contributed by parents. So
people think that you can either have a lot of kids, each with low human
capital, or a few with high human capital. To the extent that human
capital is a product of genetic factors (quite a lot), this tradeoff
*does not exist*.
