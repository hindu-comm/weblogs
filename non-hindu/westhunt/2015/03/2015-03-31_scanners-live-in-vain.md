Scanners Live in Vain

There is a new paper out in Nature Neuroscience, mainly by Kimberly
Noble, on socioeconomic variables and and brain structure: *Family
income, parental education and brain structure in children and
adolescents*. They found that cortex area went up with income, although
more slowly at high incomes. Judging from their comments to the press,
the authors think that being poor shrinks your brain.

Of course, since intelligence is highly heritable, and since people in
higher social classes, or with high income, have higher average IQs
(although not nearly as high as I would like), you would expect their
kids to be, on average, smarter than kids from low-income groups (and
have larger brains, since brain size is correlated with IQ) *for genetic
reasons.* But I guess the authors of this paper have never heard of
any of that – which raises the question, did they scan the brains of the
authors? Because that would have been interesting. You can actually do
microscopic MRI.

Even better, in talking to Nature, another researcher, Martha Farah,
mentions unpublished work that shows that the brain-size correlation
with SES is already there ( in African-American kids) by age one month!

Of course, finding that the pattern already exists at the age of one
month seriously weakens any idea that being poor shrinks the brain: most
of the environmental effects you would consider haven’t even come into
play in the first four weeks, when babies drink milk, sleep, and poop.
Genetics affecting both parents and their children would make more
sense, if the pattern shows up so early (and I’ll bet money that, if
real, it shows up well before one month); but Martha Farah, and the
reporter from Nature, Sara Reardon, ARE TOO FUCKING DUMB to realize
this.
