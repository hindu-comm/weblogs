The Once and Future Khan

Razib Khan managed to get himself hired and fired by the New York Times
over the course of a single day, an enviable record. Having the Times
look upon you with favor is a dubious honor in the first place,
something like having a leper ask you out on a date – so a quick
hire-and-fire is optimal. Something for the CV, but you never had to
actually hang out with the slimebags. Not as cool as ‘refused the
Fields Medal’, but pretty cool.

I am not Razib, and I disagree with him on some things of importance:
but I look forward to the day, a few years hence, when Razib is still
cursing the ignorant commenters, while the New York Times is one with
the dust of Nineveh and Tyre.
