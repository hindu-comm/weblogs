Traces of selection

A couple of interesting articles just came out in MBE on how natural
selection has affected human populations that ran into problems with
trace elements, either too much or too little.
[One](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/24/molbev.msv043.abstract)
talked about adaptation to selenium shortages (which I’ve
[mentioned](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/let-george-do-it/)):
this is a problem in parts of China, among other places. It seems
that there has been a shift in the frequencies of variants of several
genes involved in selenium metabolism – polygenic selection . The
[other](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/26/molbev.msv046.abstract)
paper discussed adaptation to high arsenic levels among people in the
northern Argentinian Andes: this involved a partial selective sweep on a
variant of a single gene (AS3MT) that appears to be the major gene for
arsenic metabolism.

Probably there have been adaptive changes in response to iodine
shortages, which are fairly widespread. In principle, shortage or
oversupply could be a problem for any essential trace element; but it
looks as if, in most cases, the trace element is fairly abundant in the
environment (compared to the amount we need) while humans can tolerate a
fair amount more than the minimum. Selenium is something of an
exception: shortages and toxicity both occur.

Vitamin shortages and surpluses we know something about. I’m sure that
most of my readers have learned their lesson and no longer gobble polar
bear liver. It looks as if you can suffer from an ergothioneine
shortage from a wheat diet, and a more-active form of the ergothioneine
transporter has undergone a partial sweep in southern Europe (EEF).
Interesting that dietary scientists aren’t sure what problems are caused
by ergothioneine shortages: but the existence of a specific
ergothioneine transporter, and that partial sweep, sh0w it does indeed
do something useful. That’s a a useful approach to showing that
something is useful or essential in humans, easier than putting a
platitude of sophomores on a special diet and seeing if their hair
falls out or they develop ED – show that there is specific molecular
machinery for importing it.

I think there’s a fair chance that some populations – I’m thinking of
maize and Amerindians – have adapted to poor amino acid quality: having
too many of some essential amino acids and too few of others (like
lysine): like Scrabble with more ‘Q’s than ‘U’s.

There might be adaptation to a cassava diet: cyanide tolerance. In
South America, of course, not Africa.

There are lot of examples in which any sensible person (of which there
are about five) knows that some between-population trait difference
almost certainly has a genetic cause (because we always see it in every
sample of that pop, in different environments) but we don’t know the
genetic details, or have only a limited knowledge. For example, some
populations have a lot more trouble handling alcohol than others –
which, pace Robin Hanson , is genetic. We know something about the
basis of this among East Asians, but I don’t think we know the genetic
architecture in other populations.

What other factors that haven’t been considered at may have selected
for various things in humans ? Please say something that we haven’t
heard a million times before.
