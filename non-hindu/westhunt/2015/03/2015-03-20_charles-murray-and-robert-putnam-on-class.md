Charles Murray and Robert Putnam on class

Charles Murray recently wrote *Coming Apart* about growing class
differences in white Americans. Robert Putnam, a Harvard professor of
government or something, has a new popular book, *Our Kids: The American
Dream in Crisis*. They apparently say much the same thing (I haven’t
read Putnam’s yet). They appear together at the Aspen Institute,
whatever that is, in an excellent [Youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB5kQ2XDbAg). They are on the
opposite ends of the political spectrum yet they have no disagreements
about substance.

When the audience asks about policy implications, Murray has little to
say because, he says, he is a libertarian. Putnam’s response, on the
other hand, is chilling. We need more pre-K education and we need to
train our teachers to fill the role of inadequate parents for our
children. Scary: I hope that he will leave our children alone.

One wonders how Putnam thinks about these issues. While we are on the
topic I quote a review of a previous famous Putnam paper by the great
John Derbyshire from his book *We are Doomed*.

> In September 2006, political scientist Robert Putnam was awarded the

> As usual with such events in the academic world, Putnam presented a
> research paper to commemorate the event. The paper is titled “E
> Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century,”
> and can easily be found on the Internet. I’ll refer to it in what
> follows as “the Uppsala paper.”  
> That paper has a very curious structure. After a brief introduction
> (two pages), there are three main sections, headed as follows:
>
> The Prospects and Benefits of Immigration and Ethnic Diversity (three
> pages)  
> Immigration and Diversity Foster Social Isolation (nineteen pages)  
> Becoming Comfortable with Diversity (seven pages)

> I’ve had some mild amusement here at my desk trying to think up

> Health benefits of drinking green tea  
> Green tea causes intestinal cancer  
> Making the switch to green tea
>
> Social science research in our universities cries out for a modern
> Jonathan Swift to lampoon its absurdities.
