Another one bites the dust!

Iain Mathieson and the Reich-Patterson crew have a new
[paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/13/016477) out on
natural selection over the past 8,000 years in Europe, much fortified by
the availability of ancient DNA and knowledge of the ancestral mix.

The first point is that lactose tolerance is a fairly late development
in Europe, not common (unseen in these samples) until almost the bronze
age (first seen in a Bell Beaker skeleton). In particular they don’t
see it (not common) in the Yamnaya, which must mean that it wasn’t a
driver of the Indo-European expansion: we were wrong. I suspect it did
exist in the early Indo-Europeans, since we see the same haplotype in
India, but one guy wandering around can change the distribution of an
adaptive allele. I also don’t understand how they got such a low
estimate of its selective advantage (1.5%), but maybe I can winkle that
out.

It looks as if there was selection for greater height among the Yamnaya
– a possible parallel with Nilotics?

The strong light-skin allele, SLC24A5, does look to be mainly introduced
by the early neolithic farmers, but there’s weirdness. It’s not found
in the western hunter-gatherers, but it is there in Scandinavian
hunter-gatherers, where you also see the well-known EDAR 370A mutation.
It’s even possible that it originated there – but it’s rare in Europeans
today, although you see it in Finns a little.
