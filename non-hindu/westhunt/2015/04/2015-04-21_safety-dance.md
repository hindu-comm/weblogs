Safety Dance

I understand that many college students are made to feel “unsafe” by
certain speakers addressing particular subjects. But although most
people like crisp breakfast cereal, there are those that like it as
soggy as possible. One would think that there must be a significant
fraction of the university market that wants genuinely scary content, a
fraction that prefers mega-aggression to microaggression.

I can do that.
