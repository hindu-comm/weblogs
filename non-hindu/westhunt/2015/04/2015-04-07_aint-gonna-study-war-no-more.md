Ain’t gonna study war no more

Military history has almost vanished from academia, especially in
‘elite’ institutions. This is probably related to that strange
Bellesiles incident, and the trend toward Kumbaya models of prehistory
in archaeology and anthropology. It’s not just that academic historians
don’t publish on war – they don’t know anything about it themselves, and
they have contempt for anyone who does. A colleague asked John Lynn if
military historians wrote in crayon; one head of a history department
called military history “of interest only to hormone-driven fraternity
boys.”

Pride in ignorance: that’s hard for me to understand. There are subjects
that don’t interest me, like baseball stats, where not knowing doesn’t
much bother me – still, ignorance of sabermetrics is nothing to be
*proud* of. Putting war in that category strikes me as deeply crazy.
Like the bad man says, you may not be interested in war, but war is
interested in you.

Unfortunately, some of the remaining military historians try to placate
the history establishment by reframing the subject in ways that cater to
establishment interests – you know, writing articles like “Dykes at
Kursk”, or discussing the role of ‘people of color’ in the wars of the
Diadochi. Sucking up to pinheads.
