Charade

I was watching Charade the other day, not for the first time, and was
noticing that the action scenes with Cary Grant (human fly, and fighting
George Kennedy) really weren’t very convincing. Age. But think what it
would be like today: we’d see Audrey Hepburn kicking the living shit out
of Kennedy, probably cutting his throat with his own claw – while still
being utterly adorable.
