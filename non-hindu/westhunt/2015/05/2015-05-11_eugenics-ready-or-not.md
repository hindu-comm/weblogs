Eugenics, Ready or Not

There is an excellent essay about eugenics, genetic manipulation, and
technology by Frank Salter
[here](https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/05/eugenics-ready/) in the
Australian webzine *Quadrant* and reprinted
[here](http://www.ruthfullyyours.com/2015/05/11/frank-k-salter-eugenics-ready-or-not-long-and-really-interesting/).
The essay is nearly free of the incessant hand wringing that pervades
most journalism about the topic. Instead the treatment is thorough, wide
ranging, and sensible—journalism for intelligent adults. Science writers
will blush with shame as they read this essay.

The links above are to part one of the article: part two is promised to
appear “shortly”.
