Dogs and Men

Razib Khan talks about a new
[article](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2900432-7)
that suggests that dogs were domesticated quite a long time ago, perhaps
more than 35,000 years ago, well before the last glacial maximum.

We know that dogs have adapted to life with people, have changed in many
ways.

I wonder how humans adapted to dogs. If they were like modern pariah
dogs, hanging around the village and eating garbage, doesn’t seem that
they would have been that influential. But if used in hunting, they
could have been very important, especially back in the Ice Age – and if
they were that important, the partnership might have generated
significant selective pressures in humans.

Parenthetically, there was an article a few years back that claimed that
dogs had probably been domesticated for \~100,000 years, while most
other estimates were around 14,000 years. Obviously there was a simple
way to reconcile those two numbers.
