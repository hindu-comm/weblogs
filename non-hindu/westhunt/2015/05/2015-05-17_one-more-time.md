One more time

One of our local error sources suggested that it would be impossible to
rebuild technical civilization, once fallen. Now if every human were
dead I’d agree, but in most other scenarios it wouldn’t be particularly
difficult, assuming that the survivors were no more silly and fractious
than people are today. So assume a mild disaster, something like the
effect of myxomatosis on the rabbits of Australia, or perhaps toe-to-toe
nuclear combat with the Russkis – \~90% casualties worldwide.

Describe the recovery process, why it’s feasible and in fact almost
easy. Show your work.

There’s no reason that I should have to explain *everything*.
