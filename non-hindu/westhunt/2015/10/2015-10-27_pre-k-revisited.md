Pre-K revisited

There was a nice study of pre-K in Tennessee. People applied for pre-K
, more than could be accommodated, so some were admitted (randomly) and
some were not. Then the kids admitted were compared with the control
group, those not admitted. This nicely controls for any systematic
differences among volunteers, which often exist. By third grade the
pre-K kids were doing *worse*, although I think not hugely worse. So
pre-K is pointless (big surprise, considering that shared parental
environment doesn’t affect smarts)- not that this or anything else is
going to change James Heckman’s mind.

But then, I don’t think that most proponents of this kind of
intervention have ever cared a whole lot about efficacy, because if they
had, they would have run statistically powerful studies of the effects
of pilot programs. I mean, it’s not as if statistical methods are a
secret. If they were serious they would stop spending money on
approaches that have been seen to fail and try to spend it on something
that worked, or might work – but I don’t see that happening.
