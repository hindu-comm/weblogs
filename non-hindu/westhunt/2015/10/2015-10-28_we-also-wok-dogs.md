—We Also Wok Dogs

*  
*Using CRISPR, Chinese researchers have produced [overly-muscled
beagles,](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/542616/first-gene-edited-dogs-reported-in-china/)
by knocking out myostatin. They say their goal is to create dogs with
mutations that mimic human diseases such as Parkinson’s and muscular
dystrophy, for medical research, but I’m not 100% sure that’s what they
really have in mind.
