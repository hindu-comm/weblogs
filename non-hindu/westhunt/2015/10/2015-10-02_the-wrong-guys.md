The Wrong Guys

The social sciences have developed in ways that are not necessarily to
our advantage. How to fix?

Jonathan Haidt thinks that social psychology has problems (I might put
it a bit more strongly) that might be ameliorated by adding ideological
diversity – Republicans or Jacobites or whatever.

Personally, I doubt it. I don’t think that the guys who produce all
those unreplicable results were driven by the search for that Eureka
moment when you finally figure it out, finally see it clearly. I don’t
think it’s really a product of people with the right motives whose
statistics are sloppy, which we do see in some other fields and can
sometimes fix.

I think they’re just no damn good.
