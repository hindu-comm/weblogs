Hot enough for you?

There’s a new
[study](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature15725.html)
out in Nature, claiming that economic productivity peaks at 13 degrees
Centigrade and that global warming will therefore drastically decrease
world GDP.

Singapore. Phoenix. Queensland. Air-conditioners!

Now that I’ve made my point, just how stupid are these people? Do they
actually *believe* this shit? I keep seeing papers by economists – in
prominent places – that rely heavily on not knowing jack shit about
anything on Earth, papers that could only have been written by someone
that didn’t know a damn thing about the subject they were addressing,
from the influence of genetic diversity on civilization achievement
(zilch) to the massive race-switching that happened after the Civil War
(not). Let me tell you, there’s a difference between ‘economic
imperialism’ and old-fashioned real imperialism: people like Clive of
India or Raffles bothered to learn something about the territory they
were conquering. They knew enough to run divide et impera in their
sleep: while economists never say peccavi, no matter how badly they
screw up.
