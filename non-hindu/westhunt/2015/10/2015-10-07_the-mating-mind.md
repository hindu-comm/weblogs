The Mating Mind

Do women find high intelligence attractive? Apparently not [(MALE
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (G) DOES NOT INCREASE FEMALE SEXUAL
ATTRACTION](http://drjamesthompson.blogspot.com/2015/09/do-women-find-bright-men-sexy.html)),
as discussed on James Thompson’s blog. I think I already knew this, to
the extent that I thought Geoffrey Miller’s book on the subject a barrel
of crazy.

I’m pretty sure that, on average, men don’t find intelligence attractive
in women, either. Although a few do (like me).
