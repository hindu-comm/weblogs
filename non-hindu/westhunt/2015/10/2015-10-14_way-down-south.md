Way Down South

I hear (tweets by Razib Khan , concerning Sankararaman’s talk at ASHG)
that the Denisovans had substantially more genetic diversity than
Neanderthals ( determined mainly by the variety seen in admixed
segments). It makes sense that the Neanderthals should have low
diversity: at glacial maxima, they had to retreat into small refugia.
As John Hawks says, a northern population. While the Denisovans could
have spent the cold times in southeast Asia and Sundaland. The largest
long-term population of modern humans outside Africa was in southern
Asia during glacial maxima (judging from Bayesian skyline analysis of
mtDNA) .

The high level of Denisovan admixture seen in Melanesians and Philippine
Negritos may also argue for plenty of Denisovans in Sundaland.

We don’t know who was in India – but since it would have a big refugium,
it probably wasn’t Neanderthals.
