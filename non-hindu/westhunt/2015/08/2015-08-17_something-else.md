Something else

Razib has
[talked](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-genetic-architecture-natural-history-of-pigmentation/)
about this – here’s what I think.

The various sweeping alleles that have made Europeans and North Asians
have light skin were not favored because they helped you garner extra
vitamin D, at least not mostly. This is apparent from the allelic
structure. There is a single sweeping variant for SLC24A5: if paleness
was the point, many partial loss-of-function alleles would be favored,
rather like what we see with G6PD deficiency (a malaria defense). But
there is only one: so loss of function is not the point (or at least not
the sole point): that particular variant has some other advantage, a big
one. The fact that it’s favored up on the Ethiopian plateau is another
sign that it isn’t driven by vitamin D. There is only one blue-eye
mutation (OCA2), only one main blond mutation (KITLG). The SLC24A5
mutation has by far the largest effect on skin color – if it isn’t being
selected for paleness, the sweeping alleles of other coloration genes
aren’t either. Probably not even MC1R – it has many common
loss-of-function mutations, which implies that loss of function is
favored – but probably not because of the paleness. Something else.

If you’re close enough to the equator, you need dark skin, and the genes
in these pathways are constrained – not free to change. But if they are
free to change, then a change that improves fitness through a
pleiotropic effect is now free to spread, since the resulting paleness
is bearable. In many cases that would require a specific change, not
just loss of function – so we see an allelic structure unlike that of
G6PD.

The same is likely the case with the various sweeping skin-color alleles
in East Asia (although they are less colorful).

So we need to figure out what useful thing these mutations actually
do. Dropping the vitamin D hypothesis raises lots of questions.
