Perverted Frogs

*Pedophylax esculentus* is a common type of frog in Europe. It
originated as a hybrid of two other frog species (*P. ridibundus* (RR)
and *P. lessonae* (LL) ), but that’s not their fault. However, the way
in which they continue the species is genuinely embarrassing, almost as
bad as puppeteers.

*P. esculentus* ( genome RL) generally produces offspring by mating with
another species, usually *P. lessonae*. In most populations, they
produce gametes that only contain the R genome (the L genome is
discarded): mating with *P. Lessonae* restores the L genome. Presto,
more hybrids.

They can mate with others of their kind, but few tadpoles survive –
essentially because the parental genome (R) does not go through sexual
recombination – thus mutations have accumulated over the many
generations since the original hybridization. Muller’s ratchet.

In eastern Europe, it’s the other way around: the L genome is clonal and
the hybrids have to mate with *P. ridibundus*, with complex results (3/4
hybrids, 1/4 pure *ridibundus*).

And then some populations manage with a mix of diploid and triploid
hybrids, which we’ll leave as an exercise for the reader.

Anyhow, the truly weird thing is, people *eat* these things.
