Brain Topography

Although Richard Nisbett has
[written](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743255356/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743255356&linkCode=as2&tag=the10000yeaex-20&linkId=PQYOFN5SUWTCIQKJ)
about long-term differences in cognitive style between East and West,
he is, I think, dismissive of the possibility that biology might explain
such differences, or any other mental differences – at least publicly.
He had a piece in the New York Times titled “All Brains Are the Same
Color”, for example.

But as it [turns
out](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2900671-5),
the three-dimensional geometry of the cortical surface is highly
predictive of individuals’ genetic ancestry – there are regional
differences in the folding and gyrification, as well as volume and
cortical area. I already knew that the Chinese had decided to develop
their own [brain anatomical
atlas](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050939),
due to average differences between European and Chinese brains, but
this article takes it farther.
