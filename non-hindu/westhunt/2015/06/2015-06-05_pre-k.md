Pre-K

I doubt if it will have much effect. Judging from twin studies,
parenting effects are small or zero. I doubt if preschool as we know it
has stronger effects.

Of course we’ll do it anyhow. Just for laughs, it would be nice if
someone would develop a comprehensive account of similar efforts over
the past couple of generations – and their outcomes.
