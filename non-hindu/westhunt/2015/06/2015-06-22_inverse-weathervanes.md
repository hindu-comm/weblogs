Inverse weathervanes

I was thinking about something Razib Khan said – that sociology is
useful, because it has negative predictive value. He’s probably right,
but when you think about it, that’s odd. There are a lot more possible
wrong theories than right ones – which means that identifying the right
theories is difficult. Identifying anti-correct theories, exact
negatives of the truth, should be just as difficult. Perverse, too, of
course, but who’s counting?

Considering that sociologists typically deny the very existence of some
of the most important causal factors on human behavior (like genetics),
you’d think their theories would make about as much sense as Galenic
medicine or Freudian psychology – not even wrong. Their theories should
not make *antisense* – more like random nonsense.

Probably they manage this by denying experience. Experience can show
that a method works centuries before anyone has a correct theory of
*why* it works. There are things that your grandmother (and her
grandmother) knew – (the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, blood
is thicker than water) – and without those grannies, sociologists
wouldn’t know what to disbelieve.
