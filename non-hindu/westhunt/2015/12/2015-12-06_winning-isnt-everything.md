Winning isn’t everything

Ashton Carter, who has a brain even if he doesn’t use it, just declared
all combat positions open to women. I’ve heard people say that’s ok –
sure, hardly any women are as strong as men, but if you hold everyone to
the same standards, it won’t matter. But of course we won’t hold women
to the same standards. Already we don’t. Almost none of the women
admitted to West Point (about a fifth of the class) pass the old
standards. Women have qualified as Army Rangers – of course that too
involved a thumb on the scale. **NO** woman can legitimately pass Ranger
school.

So why are we doing this? We sure don’t do it in professional sports –
because there, winning matters. We don’t seem to care if the offensive
line ‘looks like America’ – sheesh, we don’t much care if they’re all
felons.

Judging from our actions, winning is the *only* thing in football – but
not in war.
