Inferior Faunas

I mentioned South American paleontologists defending the honor of their
extinct animals, and pointed out how stupid that is. There are many
similar cases: Jefferson vs Buffon on the wimpiness of North American
mammals (as a reader pointed out), biologists defending the prowess of
marsupials in Australia (a losing proposition) , etc.

So, we need to establish the relative competitive abilities of different
faunas and settle this, once and for all.

Basically, the smaller and more isolated, the less competitive. Pretty
much true for both plants and animals.

Islands do poorly. Not just dodos: Hawaiian species, for example, are
generally losers: everything from outside is a threat.

Next up from islands is Australia: still losers. The only invasive
species I can think of that originated in Australia is the brushtail
possum – and it invaded New Zealand. That’s like a dwarf beating up a
midget. Birds can be an exception – they aren’t really isolated, if
they have good powers of flight. Some say that crows originated in
Australia. By the way, there is a chance that penguins originated in New
Zealand. I suspect that NZ’s faunal backwardness might have aided
penguin evolution, for reasons that I leave as an exercise for my
readers.

South America: not as embarrassing as Australia, where the local
predators are out-competed by house cats, but South America’s only
competitive mammal export is the nutria, as far as I know. The locals
did poorly in the big interchange with North America, after the
formation of Panama.

North America has had lots of contact with Eurasia, is fairly big,
hasn’t really been isolated. Important lineages like horses and camels
originated in North America. That said, some elements of the North
American biome seem uncompetitive – seems like freshwater fish are
pretty vulnerable to invaders. And Eurasian steppe imports do pretty
well – things like tumbleweed and cheatgrass.

Africa was an island continent for a long time: although some of the
Afrotheria have done well, particularly elephants, most have not. As
far as I know, there was only the one mammalian lineage in old Africa,
which may have limited local competition.

Eurasia: if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. the two
biggest placental clades, Euarchontoglires and Lauriasiatheria
apparently originated in Lauriasia (Eurasia plus North America) .
Between them, they account for more than 95% of placental mammal
species.
