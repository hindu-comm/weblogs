Shoot to Kill

Some people claim that it is really, really difficult for humans to
psych themselves up to kill another human. They often cite a
[claim](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806132809/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0806132809&linkCode=as2&tag=the10000yeaex-20)
by S. L. A. Marshall that only a small fraction – less than 25% – of
WWII American combat infantrymen fired their weapons in battle.

Other people (Dave
[Grossman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316040932/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316040932&linkCode=as2&tag=the10000yeaex-20)
in particular) have built major theoretical structures on this
observation, saying that humans have a built-in mental module than
inhibits us from killing conspecifics (presumably for the good of the
species). Grossman parlayed this line of thought into a stint as a
professor of psychology at West Point.

Which is pretty impressive, especially when you consider that it’s all
bullshit. S.L.A Marshall’s ‘data’ is vapor; there was and is nothing to
it. He made shit up, not just on this topic.  There’s every to reason
to think that the vast majority of infantrymen throughout history did
their level best to kill those on the other side – and there’s a
certain satisfaction in doing so, not least because it beats them
killing you.

You have to wonder about a universal human instinct that apparently
misfired in every battle in recorded history.
