World Without Stars

Some recent
[work](//news.sciencemag.org/physics/2014/11/complex-life-may-be-possible-only-10-all-galaxies)
suggests that most galaxies have too many gamma-ray bursters, such that
most planets get hosed every so often, making complex life practically
impossible – as if it wasn’t already. It seems that low levels of heavy
elements (heavier than helium: “metallicity”) make this more likely, so
that conditions were unfavorable in almost all galaxies for the first
few billion years.

On the other hand, another recent
[paper](http://www.space.com/27682-rogue-stars-between-galaxies.html)
suggests that there are many rogue stars outside of galaxies, flung
there by gravitational interactions with giant black holes in galactic
cores. That and spindizzies.

Seems to me that forming in a galaxy might give a solar system enough
heavy elements, while being flung into the intergalactic deeps would
protect you from cosmic catastrophes like gamma-ray bursts. Such stars
might be good homes for complex life, especially a few billion years
ago.

Interstellar travel is hard enough for us, but for these guys, it would
be a bitch. That first step is a doozy.
