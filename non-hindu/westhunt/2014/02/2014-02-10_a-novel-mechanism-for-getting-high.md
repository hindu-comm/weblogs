A novel mechanism for getting high

There is a new
[paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140210/ncomms4281/full/ncomms4281.html)
out that finds that Tibetans are the product of admixture between a
Han-like population and a Sherpa-like population – and that the
altitude-adaptive alleles come from the Sherpa side, which split from
the Han a long time ago (20-40k years) and have likely been living at
high altitude for a long time. The admixture was a few thousand years
ago. Last year, I
[talked](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/tibet/) about an
article in
[MBE](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/8/1761.abstract?sid=a5b7f8ea-5376-4931-b246-dbba1df4d8d8)
in that came to similar conclusions – but this new paper has gone
farther, identifying the population source for these adaptive alleles.
At least, they were the immediate source…

This is contrast to Rasmus Nielsen’s earlier paper, in which he argued
that Tibetans and Han split about 3,000 years ago, and that the Tibetan
altitude adaptations arose in that relatively short time frame. I
thought that was obviously
[wrong](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/islands-in-the-sky/),
since the Tibetan adaptations work so much better than those in Andean
Indians – and since there is archaeological evidence that people settled
Tibet much earlier than that.

Maybe the silliest line in any of these papers was in the abstract of
the new one, where they say (about adaptive introgression) “Therefore
we identify a novel mechanism, beyond selection on new mutations or
standing variation, through which populations can adapt to local
environments. ”

People have been deliberately using admixture in domesticated animals to
add favored local traits for thousands of years. That ought to be long
enough to get into the genetics curriculum, no matter what Ernst Mayr
may have said.
