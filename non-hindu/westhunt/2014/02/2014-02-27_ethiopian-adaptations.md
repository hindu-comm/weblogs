Ethiopian altitude adaptations

I said a while ago that the altitude adaptations in Tibet were too damn
good, more effective than those seen in Andean Amerindians, and so must
have originated in a population that lived at high altitude for a long
time. This seems to be the case.

The same must be true of Ethiopia. Their altitude adaptations also work
well. There is a genetic component in Ethiopia that seems to correspond
to the original hunter-gatherers, and the altitude alleles must have
originated in that population, not the later components that look like
East Africans or Levantines.

In both cases, thereâ€™s a fair chance that the ultimate origin could be
some archaic group.
