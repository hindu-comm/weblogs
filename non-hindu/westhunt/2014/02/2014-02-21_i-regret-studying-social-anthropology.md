“I regret studying social anthropology”

The best part of running a blog is the quality of many of the people who
show up. A recent customer, “A.J. West”, has a blog of his own
[here](http://alwestmeditates.blogspot.com/)that our readers will
surely enjoy.

Periodically on this blog Greg vents about anthropologists. When I name
the people in our own department to him he allows that they are all
excellent but he insists that most of anthropology is a disgraceful
wasteland. He may be right: I pay little or no attention to
anthropology any more.

Now on the West blog we have sad but funny confirmation of Greg’s point
of view but without the outrage. West went to Oxford to study social
anthropology, with interests that many of us share, only to discover
that his interests were regarded with disdain and outside the stream of
social anthropology. His story is that of a virgin finding himself in a
bawdy house, or something like that. That particular post is
[here](http://alwestmeditates.blogspot.com/2014/01/i-regret-studying-social-anthropology.html)and
is a good read, along with a later post on
[obscurantism](http://alwestmeditates.blogspot.com/2014/01/obscurantism.html).
