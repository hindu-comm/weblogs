Arguing with Corn

In our first book, when talking about the power of natural selection, I
pointed out that selection is ubiquitous in domesticated species. I said
that selection has let us grow more corn \[maize\], lots more corn. “You
can’t argue with corn”, said I.

But I was wrong! You *can* argue with corn, if you’re Richard
Lewontin. His thesis, which he used to write about occasionally before
his recent turn to developing new ideas about [mitochondria and
ribosomes](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/pearls-from-lewontin/),
is that hybrid corn is a bad thing, a product of capitalist seed
companies intent upon making farmers a captive market for hybrid seed.
If someone would only develop a just-as-good true-breeding variety of
corn, farmers wouldn’t have to pay through the nose for seed. And
that’s right – except that no one has ever managed to do so.

Oddly enough, even though we have had whole nations, big ones like the
Soviet Union and Red China, that were almost as far left as Lewontin,
and would have stood to gain by such a project, it never happened. 
Perhaps capitalist roaders nipped it in the bud, those bastards.

Of the points Lewontin made, my favorite was that hybrid corn is somehow
illegitimate because we don’t really understand that’s going on with
hybrid vigor. And we don’t, not entirely – people are still arguing
about dominance vs overdominance. Of course, the same kind of nut that
considers practical success worthless without a theoretical explanation
could well favor practical failures that really ought to work in theory.

But that would be wrong.

Maybe the funniest bit here is that the main exponent of hybrid corn,
back in the day, was Henry A. Wallace, Vice President from 1940-1944,
and the fuzziest-headed pinko to ever hold high office in the United
States. Even more than FDR, Wallace just knew that good intentions would
produce good relations with Uncle Joe. And those zeks at Magadan and
Kolyma – they were volunteers!

Even though there was a lot of distrust in the Democratic Party, with
even FDR turning against him, Wallace was pretty sure he’d be President,
considering FDR’s health. He was already considering Cabinet
nominations: as far as I know, only two of those he planned to pick were
actual Soviet agents (Laurence Duggan for State and Harry Dexter White
for Treasury). Nobody’s perfect!

We can thank the Southern racists and crooked machine politicians who
chucked him in 1944 for saving our collective ass – and we can thank
Wallace for an 8-billion bushel corn crop.
