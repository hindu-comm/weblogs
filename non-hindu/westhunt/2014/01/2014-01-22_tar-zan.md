Tar-Zan*

\*([means](http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Mangani.pdf) white skin,
like you didn’t know that)

A mutant version of SLC24a5 is the biggest single cause of light skin
color in Western Eurasia. It’s very widespread:

[![SLC24A5](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/slc24a5.jpg?w=640&h=234)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/slc24a5.jpg)

The usual explanation is that light skin ( in Western Eurasia), caused
by this variant of SLC24A5, a variant of SLC45A2, and a few other loci,
is a product of selection for increased vitamin D production in areas
with low levels of UV radiation. It also seems likely that being too
pale in a sufficiently sunny land would lead to problems, like skin
cancer.

But this mutation wasn’t common in the old European hunter-gatherers: it
may not have existed at all. While it was probably common in the
Sardinian-like farming populations that apparently originated somewhere
in the Middle East – Otzi had it.

But you know, this mutation exists at pretty high frequencies in places
that seem sunny. Its gene frequency in Moroccans is 90%. In Egypt,
88%. Libya, 92%. Saudis, 95%. 47% in South India. It’s 50% in
Sinhalese, right on the equator.

In pure East Asians, and Amerindians, it’s apparently unknown. It’s
rare in most of Africa, but you do see it in places like Ethiopia (55%)
and peoples like the Masai (27%).

It’s 7% in the San, but we know who to blame for that, don’t we?

So: although this mutation may help with vitamin D in Copenhagen or
Tullamore, that can’t be the reason for such high frequencies in North
Africa or India.

SLC24a5 does something other than confer more vitamin D: something that
resulted in tremendous fitness advantage.
