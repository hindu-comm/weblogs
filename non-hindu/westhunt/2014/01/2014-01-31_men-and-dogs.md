Men and Dogs

In his blog, the mermaid’s tale, Ken Weiss wonders if the characteristic
behaviors of different dog breeds are inculcated, rather than inborn:

“Which raises the general question of just how built-in strain-specific
temperaments and the like really are. To what, if any, extent is it that
given breeds are raised in particular ways that make it seem as if the
resulting behaviors are ‘genetic’? Are breed behavior characteristics
being overstated?”  

Of course this question has already been answered years ago by Dan
Freedman, who had puppies of various breeds raised by raised by bitches
of another breed. As I noted
[earlier](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/dan-freedmans-babies/),
breed personality looks to be inborn: Little beagles were irrepressibly
friendly. Shetland sheepdogs were most sensitive to a loud voice or the
slightest punishment. Wire-haired terriers were so tough and aggressive
that Dan had to wear gloves when playing with puppies that were only
three weeks old. Basenjis were aloof and independent.

Freedman went on to find similar personality differences in newborn
babies of different races, as seen
[here](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz2jjx_cross-cultural-differences-in-newborn-behavior_news#.UW7ho8rkef0).
I sure hope that Ken Weiss watches it. Could be funny.
