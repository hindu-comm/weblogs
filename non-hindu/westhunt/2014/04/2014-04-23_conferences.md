Conferences

I just spent a couple of days at a conference in Chicago, one urging the
geneticists and the economists to be friends (Conference on Genetics and
Behavior). I suppose it could happen someday. There were a few
interesting talks, which I will blog about at some point, and of course
some really good stuff that I’m not supposed to tell to any man of woman
born.

At this point I’ve attending a fair number of conferences. Although
this one was ok, it still can’t compare to that one DARPA conference I
attended in Monterey. Some beltway bandit of the female persuasion was
talking about a proposed kinetic orbital weapons system that might be
used against hardened targets, something like
[Thor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment).  She laid out
the general idea, then got to the punch line: the tungsten rods needed
be *longer* and *stiffer*, in order to achieve greater *penetration*,
evidently an issue of great concern to her. I was sitting with a
friend, way up in the stands. I was laughing like hell, but everyone
else was in shock, quiet as the grave, unable to believe their ears.
