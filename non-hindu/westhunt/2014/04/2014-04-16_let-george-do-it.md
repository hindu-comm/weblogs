Let George Do It

I was thinking about how people would have adapted to local differences
in essential micronutrients, stuff like iodine, selenium, manganese,
molybdenum, zinc, etc. Australia, for example, hasn’t had much
geological activity in ages and generally has mineral-poor soils. At
first I thought that Aboriginals, who have lived in such places for a
long time, might have developed better transporters, etc – ways of
eking out scarce trace elements.

Maybe they have, but on second thought, they may not have needed to.
Sure, the Aboriginals were exposed to these conditions for tens of
thousands of years, but not *nearly* as long as kangaroos and wombats
have been. If those animals had effective ways of accumulating the
necessary micronutrients, hunter-gatherers could have solved their
problems by consuming local fauna. Let George do it, and then eat
George.

The real problems should occur in people who rely heavily on plant foods
(European farmers) and in their livestock, which are generally not
adapted to the mineral-poor environments. If I’m right, even in areas
where sheep without selenium supplements get white muscle disease
(nutritional muscular dystrophy), indigenous wildlife should not.
