More on Deafness

Last time, I was talking about the hearing children of deaf parents.
They could give us some interesting information on the effect of a
verbally impoverished environment in early life , which is the currently
fashionable explanation for low IQs and low academic achievement in some
non-Parsee minority groups. But since there have been very few decent
studies of these kids, we don’t have much info. At least I haven’t
found much.

On the other hand, we have quite a bit of info about kids who are
themselves deaf, and of course they have an even more impoverished
verbal environment.

Deafness has a big impact. Average verbal IQ is 85, a standard
deviation below normal. Nonverbal IQ is normal – in the case of deaf
children raised by deaf parents, who have the most exposure to sign
language, it may be higher than normal. Note that these deaf-of-deaf
kids are almost entirely of European ancestry (96%), probably because of
the common 35delG connexin-26 mutation, which likely gives
heterozygotes some advantage.

Blacks in the US have a similar average verbal IQ, but also score lower
on nonverbal IQ tests. In fact, their disadvantage is greater in
nonverbal IQ than in verbal IQ.

Seems to me that limited verbal stimulation is not a very plausible
primary cause of low test scores and low academic achievement in blacks,
because the degree of deprivation needed to cause a 1-standard
deviation decline is extreme (deafness), and because there is an even
greater depression of nonverbal scores, which, judging from the results
in deaf children, should not be affected at all by limited verbal
stimulation.
