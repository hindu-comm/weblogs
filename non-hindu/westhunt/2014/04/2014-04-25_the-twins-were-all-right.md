The twins were all right

Twin studies have played a major role in investigations of genetic
influences on intelligence and personality. Generally, they suggest
that genetic influences on those traits are quite strong, a conclusion
that a lot of people have had trouble swallowing. As far as I can see,
that gag reflex was entirely due to dislike of the implications of a
strong genetic influence on human behavior, rather than any compelling
argument or solid counter-evidence.

There have always been other approaches to investigating these
questions, looking at adoption, varied degrees of relatedness, etc.
They produced generally similar results. The latest and most powerful
version is the Visscherian approach, which uses overall genetic
relatedness and is not affected by most of the possible problems with
twin studies. Eric Turkheimer put it this way: “Thanks to the Visscher
program of research, it should now be impossible to argue that the whole
body of quantitative genetic research showing the universal importance
of genes for human development was somehow based on a sanguine view of
the equal environment assumption in twin studies, putting an end to an
entire misguided school of thought among traditional opponents of
classical quantitative (and by association behavioral) genetics.”

I don’t think you get very far by talking about how the world *ought* to
work. Although you can sometimes get somewhere by deluding other people
, and maybe that’s what some of these people were up to. They were
pretty successful: lots of people think that intelligence isn’t
heritable. For some reason, people with such views have
lower-than-average birth rates, so maybe it *is* true, for them.

In general, though, I think people like Leon Kamin deceived themselves
first. Anyone who grew up in the US and came to the conclusion that
Uncle Joe was a great guy wasn’t exactly a fountain of common sense in
the first place.
