Yamna and Corded Ware

I hear some interesting things from the recent ASHG conference, mostly
from Razib Khan. It seems that the dead have spoken again: it turns out
that the genetic transition in northern Europe coincides with the
advent of the Corded Ware/Battleaxe culture – and the Corded Ware folks
were invaders from the Yamna culture. If I got this straight, Germans
today are about 70% Yamna. And if that’s so, I’ll bet that they were
even more Yamna in, say, 2800 BC. I think the previous EEF inhabitants
fared poorly. It may be that the people of Old Europe left scarcely a
trace of their blood in the veins of their conquerors – in the north.

The Yamna, were themselves a fusion of peoples – part eastern
hunter-gatherers (with a large fraction of ancient Siberian) and part a
more Middle Eastern-ish farming population, similar to Armenians.

Which fits those old notions about the Indo-Europeans starting out as a
group of warriors and magician/priests who conquered and assimilated a
race of farmers… the Aesir-Vanir war, the sobbin’ women, etc. J. P
Mallory says “the three estates of of Proto-Indo-European society were
fused only after a war between the first two against the third.” This
implies that the Sibermen were on top: which also fits the big expansion
of R1B and R1A, both of which turn out to be about 5,000 years old.

Like I said in [Silver
Blaze,](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/silver-blaze/) they’re
working out the origin and scope of the Indo-European expansion.
