Draft of paper about Amish

Mike Weight and I have a draft of a manuscript about responses to
personality tests by Amish and non-Amish young men from the same county
in Indiana. We have mentioned this material before on the blog. The
paper is getting ready to ship out: we are hoping to take advantage of
our readers and solicit comments and criticisms and outrage and
whatever. Drs. Charlton and Thompson may be especially knowledgeable
about this approach along with many of our anonymous cowards.

Our approach is to use published data from a personality test from 1970
to construct an index of “Amishness” that we call the AQ that is
analogous to the well-known IQ of cognitive testing. With that, the
whole standard machinery of quantitative genetics is immediately
available. Whether or not the genetic model is correct or near correct
there is a clear and explicit baseline that alternate models should be
able to match. For example the difference in mean AQ between young Amish
men and their non-Amish neighbors is about 2.8 standard deviations. In
the IQ world this would correspond to a group different of 42 points. In
the stature world this would correspond to a height difference of about
8 inches.
