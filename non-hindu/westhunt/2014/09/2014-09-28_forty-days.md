Forty Days

One of the many interesting aspects of how the US dealt with the AIDS
epidemic is what we didn’t do – in particular, quarantine. Probably you
need a decent test before quarantine is practical, but we had ELISA by
1985 and a better Western Blot test by 1987.

There was popular support for a quarantine.

But the public health experts generally opined that such a quarantine
would not work.

Of course, they were wrong. Cuba instituted a rigorous quarantine.
They mandated antiviral treatment for pregnant women and mandated
C-sections for those that were HIV-positive. People positive for any
venereal disease were tested for HIV as well. HIV-infected people must
provide the names of all sexual partners for the past sic months.

Compulsory quarantining was relaxed in 1994, but all those testing
positive have to go to a sanatorium for 8 weeks of thorough education on
the disease. People who leave after 8 weeks and engage in unsafe sex
undergo permanent quarantine.

Cuba did pretty well: the per-capita death toll was *35* times lower
than in the US.

Cuba had some advantages: the epidemic hit them at least five years
later than it did the US (first observed Cuban case in 1986, first
noticed cases in the US in 1981). That meant they were readier when
they encountered the virus. You’d think that because of the epidemic’s
late start in Cuba, there would have been a shorter interval without the
effective protease inhibitors (which arrived in 1995 in the US) – but
they don’t seem to have arrived in Cuba until 2001, so the interval was
about the same.

If we had adopted the same strategy as Cuba, it would not have been as
effective, largely because of that time lag. However, it surely would
have prevented at least half of the \~600,000 AIDS deaths in the US.
Probably well over half.

I still see people stating that of course quarantine would not have
worked: fairly often from dimwitted people with a Masters in Public
Health.

My favorite comment was from a libertarian friend who said that although
quarantine certainly would have worked, better to sacrifice a few
hundred thousand than validate the idea that the Feds can sometimes tell
you what to do with good effect.
