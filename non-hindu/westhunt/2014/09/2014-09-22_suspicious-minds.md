Suspicious Minds



[![presle8](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/presle8.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/presle8.jpg)

If you want a logical reason for the complete disinterest in longevity
research shown by the powers that be, the most obvious, if you’re even a
little paranoid, is that they already have the secret, and aren’t
interested in distributing it to the hoi polloi. If so, members of the
inner circle would obviously have to fake their own deaths every so
often – otherwise they might face mobs of angry peasants bearing
torches. Still, occasionally losing your identity is a small price to
pay for for the privilege of being a sequoia farmer. It wouldn’t mean
losing power – real power is already invisible.

Of course, if you were truly the top dog, there would be a temptation to
occasionally drop the disguise and shake up the groundlings. Even if
this was reported again and again, every serious person would know that
it was just fodder for trailer trash.
