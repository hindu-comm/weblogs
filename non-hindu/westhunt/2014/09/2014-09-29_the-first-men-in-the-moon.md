The First Men in the Moon

I noticed an
[article](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/09/malcolm_gladwell_s_10_000_hour_rule_for_deliberate_practice_is_wrong_genes.html)
in Slate (Practice Does Not Make Perfect), which made the perfectly
sound point that people vary in their abilities, genes have a lot to do
with it, and Malcolm Gladwell can’t help being a pinhead. He was
probably born that way.

Of course, the authors cover their hairy asses by saying we don’t know
that between-group differences in IQ or whatever are caused by genes. We
just happen to live in a world that looks exactly the same as one in
which that happened to be the case. Technically, I think that this is
called a modified limited hangout.

But what about the future? One generally assumes that space colonists,
assuming that there ever are any, will be picked individuals, somewhat
like existing astronauts – the best out of hordes of applicants. They’ll
be smarter than average, healthier than average, saner than average –
and not by just a little.

Since all these traits are significantly heritable, some highly so, we
have to expect that their descendants will be different – different
above the neck. They’d likely be, on average, smarter than any existing
ethnic group. If a Lunar colony really took off, early colonists might
account for a disproportionate fraction of the population (just as
Puritans do in the US), and the Loonies might continue to have
inordinate amounts of the right stuff indefinitely. They’d notice: we’d
notice. We’d worry about the Lunar Peril. They’d sneer at deluded
groundlings, and talk about the menace from Earth.

Fantastic, winning-Powerball-with-a-ticket-you-found-in-an-Arab-privy
luck has ensured that all existing human populations have the same
average IQ (and the same standard deviation!) but there’s no guarantee
that our luck will hold as we settle the Moon, and Mars, and the stars
beyond. We will have to make it so: enforce the principle of
mediocrity.

We will need to make sure that every such colony has its fair share of
morons.
