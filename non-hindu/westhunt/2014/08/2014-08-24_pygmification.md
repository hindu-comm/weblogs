Pygmification

A recent
[paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/08/14/1402875111.abstract)
in PNAS talks about the evolution of the Pygmies – or, more exactly,
the Pygmy phenotype, because it seems to have happened independently in
the Biaka Pygmies (west Africa) and the Batwa pygmies of Uganda. The
two groups have different genetic mechanisms for being short. Their
shortness really is genetic, of course. Pygmies are mixed, to a degree:
the more Bantu ancestry they have, the taller they are. And although
height really is affected by nutrition, Pygmies are about six standard
deviations shorter: someone of normal potential height would have had to
starve to death (twice!) to be that short, and there would be lots of
other symptoms of malnutrition that Pygmies don’t have.

Still, there were those who thought otherwise, presumably because they’d
stuck a crayon up their nose as a kid. Way up. Environment *does*
matter!

I noticed an interesting comment on this in Science: Michael Balter said
“scientists had not been sure to what extent Darwinian natural selection
is actually responsible for the Pygmy body type and how many times it
has arisen over the course of evolution.” The bit about how many times
it had arisen is reasonable – that takes looking at the genotype to be
sure, and indeed it has occurred five or more times (in Africa and
Southeast Asia). But there was no reason to wonder whether those
changes were a product of Darwinian natural selection: that was a sure
bet. Not just because it has happened multiple times in similar
rain-forest environments. Darwinian natural selection is *always*
operating.

Natural selection is not an odd, unusual, poorly understood phenomenon
like ball lighting. It is not something that last occurred 50 million
years ago, like a kimberlite pipe eruption. And, of course, it applies
to human behavioral traits, which are significantly heritable. Unless
you think that the optimum mental phenotype (considering costs and
payoffs) was the same in tropical hunter-gatherers, arctic
hunter-gatherers, neolithic peasants, and medieval moneylenders (which
would strongly suggest that you are an idiot), natural selection must
have generated significant differences between populations. Differences
whose consequences we see every day, and that have been copiously
documented by psychometricians.

This notion that ongoing natural selection is not the default – that it
only happens on national holidays or whatever – is fairly common among
biologists. Obviously untrue, because you can’t even have things *stay
the same* without ongoing selection – otherwise mutations and drift
would gradually ruin everything. Only selection lets horseshoe crabs
outlast mountain ranges.

Sure, some of this is because the topic of human psychological
differences makes biologists upset, or threatens to impose unemployment
and/or celibacy – but it also shows up in topics that don’t seem to
have much emotional or political charge. I think that only a few
biologists reject those unexciting examples of ongoing natural selection
because of a realization that they logically imply other, controversial
conclusions. They do have such implications, but I think that poorly
understood neutral theory plays a bigger role.
