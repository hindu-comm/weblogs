The Wrong Path

Turning Pygmy hasn’t turned out to be a very good long-run strategy. All
such populations have big problems. First, they’re vastly outnumbered
by peoples that adopted agriculture. Second, they’re short – shorter
than their farmer neighbors – and generally that has been a
disadvantage in disputes. Contemporary African pygmies are ‘ hereditary
servants’ of their Bantu neighbors: we have another word for that.
Maybe AK-47s will turn that around some day (God made some men big and
some men small, but Mikhail Kalashnikov made them all equal, like a good
Communist), but it hasn’t happened yet. And with their small numbers,
I’m not optimistic.

Moreover, it seems that they may have incurred an intellectual
disadvantage as well. They have small brains, probably the smallest of
any existing human population. I found a reference claiming an average
endocranial volume of 1,085 cm3 for the Aka: that’s the lowest number
ever reported. Their reported IQ scores are very, very low. Their
neighbors, who don’t score high themselves, think that the Pygmies have
rocks in their head, don’t plan ahead, are irresponsible, etc And of
course they have trouble with alcohol.

A recent paper by Andrea Migliano argued that high risk, mainly from
infectious disease, has selected for an accelerated life-history among
Pygmies. I’m not convinced, but if she’s right, they would age more
rapidly as well. I’m not sure that is actually the case.

All this should have been obvious when modern humans were wandering into
the African rainforest tens of thousands of years ago. What were they
thinking?
