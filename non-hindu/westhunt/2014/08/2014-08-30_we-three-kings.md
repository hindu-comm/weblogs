We Three Kings

A recent
[article](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0105691)
says that 40% of Chinese Y-chromosomes originated from 3 men in the late
neolithic. This pattern, fantastic success for a particular paternal
lineage, has been seen before, with the [Golden
Family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180246/)
(descendants of Genghis Khan) and the
[Qing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285168/) dynasty.
Something similar may well have happened with the big R1b and R1a
lineages.

Did any historian predict this pattern? I canâ€™t think of one, off the
top of my head. Someone who went to bed with [*The Empire of the
Steppes*](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Steppes-History-Central-Asia/dp/0813513049/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409443604&sr=8-1&keywords=the+empire+of+the+steppes)
under his pillow, someone familiar with the continuing high status of
the Golden Family in recent centuries, might have, perhaps.
