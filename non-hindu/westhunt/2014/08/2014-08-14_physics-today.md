Physics Today

I noticed an article in Physics Today, about educational techniques in
physics. A couple of psychologists from Stanford were working with Carl
Wieman, talking about how to improve physics achievement in
historically under-represented groups. Seldom have have I seen such
bullshit. They explain that intelligence isn’t a fixed quantity –
people aren’t ‘smart’ or ‘dumb’. But if your teacher thinks that
intelligence is ‘fixed’, or if you do, you’ll do badly – but not if
you’re a white or Asian male , who are somehow immune to these effects.
As an instructor, you have to careful not to let the under-represented
know that you’re making special efforts on their behalf, because then
they’ll think that you’re doing it because they’re dumb – and then
they’ll *be* dumb, presumably because that collapses the wavefunction.
Somehow these educational techniques only work if the practitioners
believe in them (really, REALLY believe in them). Unlike penicillin or
machine guns.

Carl Wieman is a smart guy, but on this subject, he’s pathetic. I have
to wonder about how how wide his slice of life has been. Has he never
watched someone break his heart trying and failing to master some
subject that others sailed through without breaking a sweat? Has he
ever actually known someone dumb? Even someone of average intelligence?
Talked to them? Listened to them? Has he ever read a single book on
psychometrics? (that’s asking a lot, but after all, he IS a Nobelist.)

I am reminded of a couple of anecdotes concerning Richard Feynman. When
his son was young, Feynman told him complicated stories that, when
finally understood, were set in some odd bur physically real environment
– say in the microworld. Those giant trees in the cavern were actually
nose hairs, etc. He tried this with his daughter, but she didn’t like
it. She wanted him to read the stories in the book, over and over, just
as they were written. He decided that people were just different –
which is true. It is even more true when the son is the offspring of one
of the smartest guys in the United States and the daughter adopted, and
thus almost certainly NOT the biological offspring of one of the
smartest people in the United States.

Brazil is another example. Feynman visited and taught in Brazil. The
girls on the beach seemed right, but something else seemed wrong: ” So I
tell them that one of the first things to strike me when I came to
Brazil was to see elementary school kids in bookstores, buying physics
books. There are so many kids learning physics in Brazil, beginning much
earlier than kids do in the United States, that it’s amazing you don’t
find many physicists in Brazil – why is that? So many kids are working
so hard, and nothing comes of it.” I don’t believe that a huge fraction
of Brazilian kids were studying physics, or for that matter a higher
fraction than in the US at the time. But I do believe that the average
IQ in Brazil at that time was a good deal lower than in the US, because
that’s what every test (and life itself) shows. And maybe that had
something to do with Feynman’s observations.
