Déjà Vu all over again: America and Europe

In terms of social organization and technology, it seems to me that
Mesolithic Europeans (around 10,000 years ago) were like archaic
Amerindians before agriculture. Many Amerindians on the west coast were
still like that when Europeans arrived – foragers with bows and dugout
canoes.

On the other hand, the farmers of Old Europe were in important ways a
lot like English settlers: the pioneers planted wheat, raised pigs and
cows and sheep, hunted deer, expanded and pushed aside the previous
peoples, without much intermarriage. Sure, Anglo pioneers were
literate, had guns and iron, were part of a state, all of which gave
them a much bigger edge over the Amerindians than Old Europe ever had
over the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and made the replacement about ten
times faster – but in some ways it was similar. Some of this similarity
was the product of historical accidents: the local Amerindians were thin
on the ground, like Europe’s Mesolithic hunters – but not so much
because farming hadn’t arrived (it had in most of the United States),
more because of an ongoing population crash from European diseases.

On the gripping hand, the Indo-Europeans seem to have been something
like the Plains Indians: sure, they raised cattle rather than living
off abundant wild buffalo, but they too were transformed into
troublemakers by the advent of the horse. Both still did a bit of
farming. They were also alike in that neither of them really knew what
they were doing: neither were the perfected product of thousands of
years of horse nomadry. The Indo-Europeans were the *first* raiders on
horseback, and the Plains Indians had only been at it for a century,
without any opportunity to learn state-of-the-art tricks from Eurasian
horse nomads.

The biggest difference is that the Indo-Europeans *won*, while the
Plains Indians were corralled into crappy reservations.

It turns out that all those Amerindians shared a fair amount of ancestry
with the original Indo-Europeans (ANE, Sibermen), but that’s probably
part of some cosmic joke for which we are the punchline.
