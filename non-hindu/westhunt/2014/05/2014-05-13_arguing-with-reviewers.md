Arguing with Reviewers

Personally, I hardly ever do it, because reviewers are hard, cruel,
ignorant creatures – at least those who don’t love your work.

Nicholas Wade thinks that I was unfair in calling the
3000-years-in-Tibet cite an error, and in saying that the low estimate
of European ancestry among the Ashkenazi Jews was wrong. He thinks that
it’s just a case of me disagreeing with those particular scientists.

He is mistaken. In the Tibetan case, there were two more recent
references that determined that the short time estimate was a mistake.
See [here](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/8/1889.short), and
[here](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/8/1761.short).

There are a number of better reports on Ashkenazi ancestry with very
different results, much higher estimates of European ancestry, both
more recent and also using several kinds of evidence, autosomal genes as
well as mtDNA.
[Here](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131008/ncomms3543/full/ncomms3543.html?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20131009),
and [here](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/80), and
[here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032072/). There is a
special problem on this case, because it seems that some researchers on
this area are strongly motivated against accepting certain results.

This is a fast-changing field – you can’t afford to be a year or two
behind the literature. Even a month can bite you, which is unfortunate
for anyone putting out a book.

These errors do not materially impact his arguments in the book – but
they could have.

Now this raises the problem of how reporters \[or POTUS, for that
matter\] are supposed to ensure high accuracy on technical subjects in
which they are not cutting-edge practitioners – which they never are. 
I think it’s not easy. Appeal to authority is unreliable. Nicholas Wade
is one of the best reporters on these subjects, but he faces this
problem as well.

How should a reporter have determined that the undersecretaries of
defense who were telling him about the Iraqi nuclear program in late
2002/early 2003 were full of shit? I could tell, but then, I knew the
subject. Could you tell? How many reporters and columnists figured it
out? I can think of few, less than five. On the other hand, the widow
next door *did* figure it out…
