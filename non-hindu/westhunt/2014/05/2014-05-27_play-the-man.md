Play the Man

Matt Ridley, like so many people, seems to think that, every so often,
you need to insert random bits of popular nonsense when skating close
to the wind on unpopular topics. For example, in his recent review of
Nicholas Wade’s book, he said

“*The average IQ of a group, a team or a race matters little, if at all.
What counts is how well they communicate, collaborate and exchange
ideas. Give me a hundred thickos who talk to each other, rather than a
hundred clever-clogs who don’t. This collaboration is surely the true
secret of human achievement and the true reason that race does not
count, not because we are all identical inside our skulls.”*

Well, accomplishment does build on past accomplishment, but having a
bunch of ordinary people natter on and on doesn’t seem to contribute
much. If it did, Facebook would already have resulted in flying cars and
cancer cures. I don’t believe that has happened.

Tell the truth. If nothing else, for the shock value.
