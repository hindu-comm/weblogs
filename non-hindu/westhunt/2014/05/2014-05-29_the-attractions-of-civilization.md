The attractions of civilization

Many have noted how difficult it is to persuade hunter-gatherers to
adopt agriculture, or more generally, to get people to adopt a more
intensive kind of agriculture.

It’s worth noting that, given the choice, few individuals pick the more
intensive, more ‘civilized’ way of life, even when their ancestors have
practiced it for thousands of years.

Benjamin Franklin talked about this. “When an Indian Child has been
brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs,
yet if he goes to see his relations and makes one Indian Ramble with
them, there is no perswading him ever to return. \[But\] when white
persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians,
and lived a while among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and
treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay
among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our
manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it,
and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods,
from whence there is no reclaiming them.”
