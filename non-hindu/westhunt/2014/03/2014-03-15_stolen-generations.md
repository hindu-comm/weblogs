Stolen generations

Someone was quoted as saying that if you adopted an Australian Aborigine
kid and raised him in England, he’d do just fine. This is a standard
prediction, or maybe really an assumption, of most social scientists:
people are the same everywhere. Let me put it more precisely: If you
adopted a random draw of such kids just after birth, and then treated
them in the same way that local native kids were treated, they’d end up
with the same adult IQ, on average. And the same rate of alcoholism, and
so forth. Same with any other racial group, the prediction says.

But is this actually true? The same people would say that one-day-old
babies from different groups ought to act the same, and that’s certainly
not true.

I would think that there was a lot of adoption of Australian Aborigines
going on in Australia, back in the day. What were the results?
