Talking to Economists

I gave a
[talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3310KWlDXg&feature=youtube_gdata),
back in April, at the University of Chicago. We were trying to
introduce some economists to genetics, which is relevant to some of the
questions they work on. Some already knew quite a bit â€“ we had three of
the main authors of the big GWAS education study last year, the first
to find replicable variants influencing something like IQ.

And some thought along other lines.
