The Giant Rat of Sumatra

A while ago, I
[said](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/silver-blaze/) that it
sure looked as if David Reich and Nick Patterson were working out the
origin and scope of the Indo-European invasion of Europe. They have more
to say on that.

The abstract for their upcoming talk (SMBE 2014) makes several points.

First, they looked at a drudge of skeletons from Samara, in Russia,
dating between 3,000 to 9,000 years before present.These samples had
the Ancient North Eurasian admixture (Sibermen), and thus are a possible
source for that late-arriving genetic component in Europe.  There was
population turnover here too: the oldest skeletons had U4 and U5 mtDNA,
while the later ones included W, H, T, I, K and J.

They go on to model how the steppe samples may relate to ancient and
contemporary DNA samples from Europe, the Caucasus, and South Asia â€“
sounds like a model of Indo-European dispersal. And, probably a model of
the Sibermen dispersal. Details are not in the abstract.

I would guess that their evidence indicates that the
Indo-Europeanization of Europe entailed massive population turnover in
northern Europe, less in southern Europe, none in Sardinia and among the
Basques. I think that you see this genetic trace of the Indo-Europeans
in the Uighurs, but very little in Iran/Pakistan/India: that late
expansion of charioteers may have involved elite dominance, or perhaps
a multistep process that diluted away much of the original genetic
signature. Maybe not quite diluted to zero: we do see the European
lactase-persistence allele in India. Of course a wildly advantageous
allele like that could be transmitted by the smallest bit of admixture.

I suspect that the SNP next to KITLG that causes blondness was fairly
common in that invasion: today it is quite rare in the Basquesand
Sardinians, fairly common in northern Europe and the Uyghurs, very rare
in India.
