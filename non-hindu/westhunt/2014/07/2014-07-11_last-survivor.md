Last Survivor

Over about 2500 years, the Middle Eastern farmers occupied almost all of
Europe. That migration seem to have a single origin: genetically they
seem quite similar, even as far as north as southern Sweden.

The indigenous foragers didn’t disappear instantly, and some seem to
have survived amidst the dominant farmers for a long time, without much
gene flow. This pattern looks similar to what we’ve seen with Pygmies
and Negritos. In these contemporary examples, the encapsulated foragers
have lost their original language. Probably those persisting European
hunter-gathers also adopted the language of the surrounding farmers.

If this picture is correct, it seems likely that almost all of Europe,
circa 4000 BC, spoke related languages, languages descended from a
language that originated in the Fertile Crescent. The language map
probably looked something the Bantu languages in Africa.

And then things went bad for the EEF peoples. There is only one
surviving language that seems likely to be member of that old radiation
– Basque. There were other languages that were probably in that family
and lasted for quite a while: Iberian, Nuragic, probably Tartessian,
maybe Etruscan, possibly Minoan and Eteocypriot. The evidence we have
on those other languages generally stems from the Classical era: by that
time, these languages had had maybe five or six thousand years to
diverge.

This means that Theo Vennemann is probably right about a Vasconic
substratum, only it should be considerably more extensive than he
suggests. The population in question originated near the heartland of
Middle Eastern agriculture (First Farmers would be a good ethnonym),
rather than spreading from a glacial refugium like Spain after the LGM.

How to prove this? Sounds tough. We may need another Rosetta stone.
