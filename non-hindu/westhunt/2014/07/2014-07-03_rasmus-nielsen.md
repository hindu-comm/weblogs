Rasmus Nielsen

The
[paper](http://www.nature.com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13408.html)
on the Denisovan origin of one of the key altitude-adaptation genes
(EPAS1) in Tibetans is now out (lead author Emilia Huerta-Sanchez,
senior author Rasmus Nielsen).

It’s on a Denisovan haplotype.  Likely Denisovans occupied a lot of
East Asia, and quite a bit of that area is fairly high altitude, not
just Tibet. We have evidence that East Asians have a bit of Denisovan
ancestry, and a small amount of admixture is all it takes to pick up a
highly advantageous variant.

Denisovans were probably in Asia for at least a couple of hundred
thousand years, much longer than anatomically modern humans. Homo
erectus and descendants were there a good deal earlier, and this variant
might have originated that far back, although it may not be divergent
enough for that to be plausible.

Here’s what Rasmus Nielsen said about this discovery:

“It was a complete surprise,” says Nielsen. “It took years after the
Denisovan genome was published for us to even try this, because we
thought it was sofar-fetched.

Which is strange, because it was quite obvious. Not just in the sense
that I told y’all about it over and over, wrote an article with Hawks on
it in 2006, and mentioned it in our book – clearly I should have gone
ahead with the fiery-letters-in-the-sky approach. Let me tell you about
a conversation I once had with Jim Crow, maybe ten years ago. I was
saying that adaptive introgession from Neanderthals was likely, and he
mentioned once hearing someone say that although there might have been a
bit of admixture with Neanderthals, it would have been biologically
insignificant. He heard that and thought “No!”; he knew that even a few
copies of an adaptive variant would likely rise to high frequency. He
never wrote it up for the Neanderthal case, but he knew.

Of course it was also likely because the Tibetan adaptations are too
damn good – different from the Andean ones, more like those seen in
mammalian species that have lived at high altitude for a long time.
Which Nielsen should have noted. Which is why the Ethiopian adaptations,
some of them anyhow, surely have pre-modern-human origins – unless
anatomically modern humans originated up on that plateau. Which I
doubt.

This may sound as if I think Nielsen is dumb, but I don’t. He was
wrong, but not dumb: I don’t pretend to know what screwed up his
thinking on this issue. One could always blame Ernst Mayr.

On the other hand, I can think of a couple of fairly well-known players
in this business who really don’t seem to understand much of anything.
I’ll let you guess who they are.
