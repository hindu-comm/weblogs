Old Europe’s Remnants

[![thinker](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/thinker.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/thinker.jpg)[![300px-Knossos_bull](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/300px-knossos_bull.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/300px-knossos_bull.jpg)

Although we know quite a bit about the artifacts, ways of making a
living, and recently even the DNA of Europe’s first farmers, we don’t
know anything about their language or much about what they thought or
believed in.[Old
Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Europe_(archaeology))was one
of the more advanced parts of the world, especially in metallurgy, but
they don’t seem to have developed writing. The Sardinians are
genetically very similar to those EEF farmers, but I doubt that they can
tell us much about the old culture. It’s been a long time.

Gimbutas thought she could reconstruct those cultures from female
figurines and Lithuanian old wive’s tales, but that was ridiculous.

On the other hand, we know a lot about the language of the invaders,
and have figured outa fair amount about Indo-European culture from
linguistic archaeology. We can see that something new was added to the
European genetic mix, but we aren’t sure where those invaders
originated. That might be resolved, fairly soon.

We know that the Indo-Europeans crushed Old Europe and eventually
imposed their language almost everywhere in Europe ( except for the
Basques), but it didn’t happen all at once. I’m wondering if there were
any cultures related to Old Europe – not just the high culture in the
Balkans, but EEF culture more generally – that survived long enough
for us to learn more about them. In particular, I’m wondering if the
Minoan culture was a product of this tradition. EEF farmers certainly
settled Crete, and I don’t think that any Indo-European types showed up
there until the Mycenaean Greeks – although I could be wrong about
that. It seems likely that the Minoans spoke a non-Indo-European
language.
