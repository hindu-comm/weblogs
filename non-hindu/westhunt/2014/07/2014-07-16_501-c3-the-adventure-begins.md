501 (c)(3) :  The Adventure Begins

The Dark Lords of the IRS have proclaimed that West Hunter Incorporated
has Federal tax-exempt status. Contributions, including various forms of
real property, are deductible. For details, write
gcochran9@comcast.net.

West Hunter’s purpose is the advancement of education and science in
anthropology and evolution. That means this blog, scientific and
popular articles, books, talks, and research projects. Depending on
resources, possible projects might include a search for effective
nootropics (possibly inspired by some of the Ashkenazi mutations),
cloning a
[super-Neanderthal](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/whats-the-catch/),
or breeding theKwisatz Haderach.

Robert Heinlein, in *Methuselah’s Children*, imagined the Howard
Foundation. Founded by Ira Howard, who made a pile in the California
Gold Rush but died young (of old age!) and childless, the foundation
bribed people with unusually long-lived ancestors into marrying people
with similar backgrounds, thus selectively breeding for longevity. This
was written in 1941, when many people still knew that such things were
possible.

You can imagine a similar foundation that breeds for intelligence: Cyril
Kornbluth did, as background for *The Marching Morons*. But today,
there’s no such thing. Any attempt would be denounced, even if utterly
non-coercive and completely successful.

Nobody’s thinking about the long run, the big issues. Well, hardly
anybody.
