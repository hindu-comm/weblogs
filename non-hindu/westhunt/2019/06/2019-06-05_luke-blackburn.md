Luke Blackburn

appears to have done something downright interesting: send vomit-soaked
clothes, from people that had died of yellow fever, to various locations
in the North during the Civil War, with the intent of triggering yellow
fever epidemics. Didnâ€™t work, since as far as we know, yellow fever can
only be transmitted via mosquito bite, mainly *Aedes aegypti.*

Jeff Davis knew about this effort.
