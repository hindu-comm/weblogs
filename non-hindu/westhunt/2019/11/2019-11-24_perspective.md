Perspective

[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/unknown_193903_v1_n1.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/unknown_193903_v1_n1.jpg)



I was some interested in the Congo wars, back in the 90s, but there was
very little coverage in the media. Eventually I ran across an article
that had maps of the front lines, reasonable discussions of the players
and their prospects – in Science (AAAS), of all places.

Their perspective: the threat the Congo War posed to the bonobos.

I’m wondering how many similar treatments exist. Is there a tome that
discusses the sanguinary battles on the Eastern Front ( Barenkovo,
Stalingrad, Third Battle of Kharkov), how they threatened and eventually
led to the demise of *Unknown/Unknown Worlds* ?

( food for Ph.D. theses)
