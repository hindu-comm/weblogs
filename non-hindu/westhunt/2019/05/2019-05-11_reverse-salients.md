Reverse salients

Edison thought in terms of reverse salients and critical problems.

“Reverse salients are areas of research and development that are lagging
in some obvious way behind the general line of advance. Critical
problems are the research questions, cast in terms of the concrete
particulars of currently available knowledge and technique and of
specific exemplars or models that are solvable and whose solutions would
eliminate the reverse salients. ”

What strikes you as as important current example of a reverse salient,
and the associated critical problem or problems?
