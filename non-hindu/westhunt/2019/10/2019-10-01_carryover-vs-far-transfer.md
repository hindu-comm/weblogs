Carryover vs “Far Transfer”

It used to be thought that studying certain subjects ( like Latin) made
you better at learning others, or smarter generally – “They*supple* the
mind, sir; they render it pliant and receptive.” This doesn’t appear to
be the case, certainly not for Latin – although it seems to me that math
can help you understand other subjects?

A different question: to what extent does being (some flavor of) crazy,
or crazy about one subject, or being really painfully wrong about some
subject, predict how likely you are to be wrong on other things? We know
that someone can be strange, downright crazy, or utterly unsound on some
topic and still do good mathematics… but that is not the same as saying
that there is no statistical tendency for people on crazy-train A to be
more likely to be wrong about subject B. What do the data suggest?

I’m mostly talking about cases where A and B have no obvious
relationship – we know that a dedicated Marxist is more likely to have
wrong notions about genetics, since heritability offends him ( probably
gravity and levity do as well). Probably also worth considering
whether the individual in question achieved craziness on his own or was
immersed in it from birth.

Lastly, sometimes that correlation must be negative: certain flavors of
crazy likely make you *less* likely to be wrong about certain other
things.
