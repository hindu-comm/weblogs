Dandruff

Dandruff is apparently caused by Malassezia globosa, a yeast. Infection
seems to speed up cell turnover, so skin cells mature and are shed in
2-7 days, instead of a month in people without dandruff. This has been
known for a while.

But this is [new](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1608-2):
there is some indication that this fungus can migrate to the pancreas,
where it is implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, the most common kind of pancreatic cancer (95%),
approximately as deadly as an 88 millimeter shell to the head.

Interesting if correct.
