The Casting Couch

I know of a few cases in which people have publicly supported the idea
that humans are bosons while personally thinking otherwise. This can
mean signing Graham Coop’s letter against Nicholas Wade \[ misplaced:
such letters are traditionally sent to Pravda\], or publicly
criticizing work they privately agree with – ” you have to read between
the lines” -, or just being careful to avoid certain dangerous topics –
“I can’t afford to think about that”.

This tendency is strongest, perhaps, in people just entering the field.
Weakest in dying Nobelists.

But life is like that sometimes. Think of what young actresses have had
to do to advance their careers. From one point of view, they deserve
respect for the sacrifice they make for their art. In the same way,
when some young geneticist is emitting protective nonsense, which can’t
be comfortable – remember: it takes a hell of a man to fuck Harvey
Weinstein.
