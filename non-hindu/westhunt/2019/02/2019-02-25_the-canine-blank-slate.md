The Canine Blank Slate

There are those that think that there are no real, baked-in average
differences in personality or smarts between different dog breeds. Pit
bulls are depraved because they’re deprived. Border collies learn to
herd at a special secret school, probably something like Hogwarts.
Genes can’t affect behavior.

This reminds me of a state’s attorney in Denver, who opined that a
proposed ban on pitbulls was unconstitutional, because of the 14th
Amendment.
