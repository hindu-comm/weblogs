Inexorable

Dr. Paige Harden said “No scientific finding leads inexorably to any
particular social policy”. Well, it would if we were Pak: they have
built-in goals and are almost always smart enough to see the best path
leading to those goals, given circumstances.

The introduction of gunpowder favored some social changes – for one,
centralization, because castles stopped working. You couldn’t fort up
and wait out the King’s men anymore. It also favored everybody using
gunpowder weapons, because they were more effective. But there was an
exception: the Tokugawa Shogunate almost entirely gave up firearms.
Obviously, this was possible in an isolated, tightly controlled Japan.
Surprisingly, unlikely, but possible. Could the same thing have
happened in early modern europe, composed of many competing states?
Could they have given up the gun?

Not in a million years. The spread of firearms weapons in Europe was…
inexorable.
