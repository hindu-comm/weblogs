The Reason Why

There are odd things about the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects that
suggest ( to some) that there might be an undiscovered super-Earth-sized
planet a few hundred AU from the Sun..

We haven’t seen it, but then it would be very hard to see. The
underlying reason is simple enough, but I have never seen anyone mention
it: the signal from such objects drops as the fourth power of distance
from the Sun. Not the second power, as is the case with luminous
objects like stars, or faraway objects that are close to a star. We can
image close-in planets of other stars that are light-years distant, but
it’s very difficult to see a fair-sized planet a few hundred AU out.
