Heritable differences in dog behavior

It turns out
[that](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/01/509315)breed
differences in behavior are highly heritable, which is interesting
since it’s impossible to define between-population heritability ( it is
so written) . But although philosophically impossible to define, it’s
apparently fairly easy to calculate.

Gene implicated in these behavioral differences between breeds include
candidate domestication genes, genes mapped to phenotypes implicated in
domestication, genes that show up in those foxes bred for tameness or
aggression, and genes that underwent positive selection in both human
evolution and dog domestication – which probably means human
domestication and dog domestication.

“For example, breed differences in aggression areassociated with
multiple genes that have been linked to aggressive behavior in
humans.Molecular associations with breed differences in energy include
genes previously linked to restingheart rate, daytime rest, and sleep
duration in humans. Lastly, breed differences in fear wereassociated
with genes linked with temperament and startle response in humans, and
several ofthe genes implicated in breed differences in trainability
have been previously associated with  
intelligence and information processing speed in humans.”

Interestingly, genotype accounts for more of the behavioral variation
between breeds than it does within breeds. Like humans, most genetic
variation in dogs is within-breed rather than between-breed ( 85%-15% in
humans, 70% to 30% in dogs), but that whole-genome number does not
matter: what matters is the distribution of the particular genes that
influence behavioral traits, not neutral or behaviorally-irrelevant
genes.

You can’t say any of these things without detailed understanding of the
causal mechanisms, just as we could not eat anything until we’d learned
that edible sugars are right-handed molecules while amino acids are
left-handed.

As for comparing dog breeds and human races, wrong because too obvious.
