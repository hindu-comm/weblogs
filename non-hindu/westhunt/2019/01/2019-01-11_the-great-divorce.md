The Great Divorce

Jeff Bezos isn’t my favorite guy, but he has ability and has built
something useful. And an ugly, contested divorce would be harsh and
unfair to the children, who have done nothing wrong.

But I don’t care. The thought of tens of billions of dollars being
spent on lawyers and PIs offer the possibility of a spectacle that will
live forever, far wilder than the antics of Nero or Caligula. It could
make Suetonius look like Pilgrim’s Progress.

Have you ever wondered whether tens of thousands of divorce lawyers
should be organized into legions or phalanxes? This is our chance to
finally find out.
