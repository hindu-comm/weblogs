Crazy about hemochromatosis

 There’s a mutation, fairly common in northern Europeans, in which
homozygotes absorb too much iron. Untreated, iron accumulation can lead
to cirrhosis and a form of diabetes. Treatment is simple: bleed the
guy, early and often. It’s one of the few syndromes where old-fashioned
medical treatment actually worked – purely by coincidence, of course.

Obvious question: what do you do with all that blood? Obvious answer:
After meeting the needs of the creatures of the night, use whatever’s
left over for transfusions.

But, in the US and most of Europe, we generally don’t, because we’re
nuts.

Ya see, the Red Cross has a policy: donors are not to be compensated,
other than orange juice and cookies. Since these guys (mostly guys, of
course, although perhaps that will change now that everyone and his
brother can menstruate) ***need*** to be bled, giving blood to the Red
Cross would allow them to avoid paying some MD to drain them and pour it
down the sink – so, they would in effect be receiving something of
value.

I’d like to think that the true motive for this policy is protecting
medicos’ income stream – but, you know, their stated reason is stupid
enough to be the real one.
