Let me count the ways

As many virologists have stated, their expectation was that the
evolution of noticeably higher-transmission variants of Cov-19 was quite
unlikely.

There is solid evidence that this has now happened at least three times
(D614G, A222V, and B.1.1.7) with at least two others likely ( in South
Africa and Brazil).

They failed in an important aspect of their job.
