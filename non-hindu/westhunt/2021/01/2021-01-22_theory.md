Theory

Once upon a time, I was talking to a young engineer about some new
wrinkle in solar concentrators. He was enthusiastic: he thought that
with a little effort, you could focus sunlight enough to generate a
temperature higher than that of the Sun itself.

I said ” Nope. ”

Theory is your friend. Correct theory, that is.
