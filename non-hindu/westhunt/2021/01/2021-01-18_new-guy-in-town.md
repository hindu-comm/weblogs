New Guy in Town

[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/fitness-curves.png?w=640&h=183)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/fitness-curves.png)

These graphs show the results of evolutionary experiments by Richard
Lenski, in which a bacterial species ( e coli) has been evolving under
constant conditions for many years: tens of thousands of generations.

These bacteria were not perfectly adapted to the experimental
environment, and so there is selection for changes that allow them to do
better in these conditions. Adaptive change is rapid at first and slows
down with time, as the culture approaches an optimum phenotype. Fitness
increases rather like the logarithm of time.

The probability of a beneficial mutation fixing is proportional to the
advantage it confers. Large-effect beneficial mutations are more likely
to fix and dominate the early phase. As the bacteria get closer to an
optimum, the possible gain from a beneficial mutation is smaller, and so
those smaller-effect beneficial mutations ( the only ones possible) are
less likely to fix. Thus they take longer to fix (on average they need
to occur many times before succeeding) and they also fix more slowly,
since their growth advantage is small.

relevance: a new virus in humans is like the situation near the origin
of graph B. The virus is not yet close to an optimum, so change is
fairly rapid – particularly if the virus is infecting vast numbers of
people ( like covid-19) which greatly increases the number of copies of
the virus and thus the chance of favorable mutations ( Fisherian
acceleration). Favorable to the virus, that is.

An old virus in humans, say measles ( \> 1000 years old) is closer to
an optimum: change is much slower.

It seems that most professional virologists are used to viruses that
have been around for quite a while – understandable, since new viruses
do not sweep through the human race every year.

You could have predicted the emergence of new higher-transmission
variants of covid-19 from this theoretical perspective. I did,
arguablywrong did, probably others have as well. But virologists did
not.
