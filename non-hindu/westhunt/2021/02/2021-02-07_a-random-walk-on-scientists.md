A Random Walk on Scientists

A number of epidemiologists and virologists did not expect to see
significant adaptive evolution for increased transmission in covid-19,
and continue to argue against that hypothesis. Vincent Racaniello,
well-known virologist, takes this position. So does David Dowd, an
infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.

They think that chance can drive a new variant with no transmission
advantage to high frequency, even when there are many cases ( tens of
thousands or more) . The B.1.1.7 variant went from \~1% to a big
majority of cases in England.

Iâ€™ve just run some sims ( with the sort of transmission dispersion
observed in cov-19). R (fitness) = 1, in both cases. I propagate 100
times in each run. Variant A starts out with 5,000 cases, B with 2000.
How often did B catch up with A? 6 out of 100 runs.

How often did B catch up with A when A started out with 50,000 cases and
B with 20,000 cases? zero, out of 100 runs.

Start out with 2000 B and 50,000 A, same fitness: how often did B catch
up? zero out of 100 runs.

Start out with 2000 B ( with a fitness of 1.05) and 50,000 A with a
fitness of 1: How often did B catch up? 100 out of 100 runs.



The top curve shows the relative frequency of B.1.1.7 as a function of
time in Denmark. Dowd can look at that and believe it is a random
fluctuation. Wow.
