Anonymous podcasts

There are some interesting pseudonymous people out on the net that would
make for an interesting podcast. However, whatâ€™s the etiquette for this?
Do they wear a paper bag over their head and use a fake accent? Maybe
just a fake mustache? A Guy Fawkes mask and computer-masked speech?
