The Last Question

Asking for a friend:

At current prices bitcoin mining is in some places not a paying
proposition, depending upon the local cost of electricity. Some
computers are thus idle. Anyone know of a project whose likely results
are either A. very interesting or B. profitable (or C. both) that could
use a couple of million computers?
