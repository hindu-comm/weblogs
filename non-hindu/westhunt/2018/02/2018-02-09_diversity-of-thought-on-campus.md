Diversity of Thought on Campus

Don’t you think that we’d all be better off if history departments hired
some proponents of [Fomenko’s New
Chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko)),
Astrophysicists assigned [Worlds in
Collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision), geology
professors lectured on
[Koreshanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreshanity), while  
half of new biology postdocs practice
[Lysenkoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism). Oops, that last
one actually actually happens now and then.

I sure don’t.
