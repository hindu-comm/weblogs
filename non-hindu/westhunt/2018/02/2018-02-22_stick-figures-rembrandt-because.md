stick figures = Rembrandt Because!

Looks as if Neanderthals did some non-representaional cave drawings. Or
they represent something we don’t recognize. Good for them.

I see people say this implies they were just like us. Somehow, any
capability for symbolism – say, as much as an average three year old
-implies that the population had just as much capacity for advanced
symbolic thought as the most accomplished modern populations. ”
Behavioral modernity” & “the psychic unity of mankind”

That make no sense. Not even a little bit. Instead of telling us
something about the intelligence of Neanderthals (who still had a simple
and slow-progressing toolkit, compared to some modern humans), it tells
you something – something sad – about the mental capabilities of the
anthropologists mouthing this nonsense.
