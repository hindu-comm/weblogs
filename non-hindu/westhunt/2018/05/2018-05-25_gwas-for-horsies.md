GWAS for horsies

If we do the proper genetic studies on horses, lots of them ( \> 10^6)
we will eventually be able to find variants that predict how large or
how fast individual horses are, and ( dare I say it) we will eventually
be able to tell if certain breeds of horses are genetically big or
small, fast or slow. People have always wondered if Percherons are
really larger than Shetland ponies – or if that’s just a stereotype.
Some say that Thoroughbreds are faster than Clydesdales – wouldn’t it
be nice to actually know for sure? Of course there are deep
philosophical questions about what ‘ genetically different ‘ really
means – and we wouldn’t really know that two breeds were different
unless we also understood the mechanism of each and every common variant
that boosted or reduced size or speed. Since quantitative selection
boosts *any* variant that favors the trait under selection, and those
variants work through many different biological pathways, we have some
work to do. But we still won’t really *know* that my Prince (a
Shetland) was inherently\* slower than Secretariat unless we understand
every one of those mechanisms. And their interactions. And their
little dog, too! We also need to understand the historical reasons for
any differences – what selective pressures drove those differences, how
those pressures varied over space and time – or we don’t really know
anything.

Admixture studies might be useful, but they’re icky.



And we need to motorize those

\* Maybe Prince was deprived due to my cousins shooting him with their
BB guns. He caught one of them later, kneeled on her, and broke her
collarbone. Depraved on account of being deprived?
