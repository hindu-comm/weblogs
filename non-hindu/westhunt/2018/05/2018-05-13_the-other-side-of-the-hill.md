The other side of the hill

I just saw someone suggest that one needs to make a serious effort to
understand the best arguments of people you disagree with – that you
should, for example, \[ spend 30 minutes or so a day reading the “other
side.”\]

I could imagine reasons for this: tactical reasons, for example. Trying
to understand what the opposition may do next. Or, in another
different, world, you might actually face an opposition that had
logically valid things to say on some issues, even many issues.

But in many situations, today’s for example, your opponents may just be
loons. Do you really think that my life would have been improved in any
way if I’d spent half an hour a day reading Freud? Or Judith Butler? I
don’t think so.

Shortcut: if they make predictions, none of which ever come true,
forget about them. Saves valuable time.
