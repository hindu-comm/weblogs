Blowing Smoke

After a long and difficult pregnancy, Nature Genetics finally gave
birth to a big
[paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3.epdf?referrer_access_token=xQBbq1pqkrKTG9Sl2T1X1tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nqad92v-7y1ilkmPqR7KMJgq_vv2M-jr2gmZ9CcUCxjKaLpN9-yY9v4iDlGgVeSLr5ogKvfcTUJbNZx0yDurIQhJFRlQfUM4ioAQoTiRCItaE_CPHGgFy3bMcv4KjAJ08graB4GBRZWdd7zJvSlJOCtM6H7igLQNcTpdwZBcQt00PVV_BcrkGKA0mfIFmmmkD1jRIpbIwM0gvc3HAX9GZQFDE91NBnk9H7y4Qv0Fh7Ww%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.theatlantic.com)about
genetic influences on educational achievement. Now we know more of the
genes that result in high heritability of phenotypes like educational
attainment – including something about the metabolic paths involved.
These results don’t explain all the heritability we see – in particular
the part due to rare deleterious variants – but they explain some.
Now, from a gene sample, knowing nothing else, we can say something
about some kid’s likelihood of completing college. People in the bottom
quintile of the polygenic score had a 10% chance of graduating, those in
the top quintile had a 55% chance.Obviously if we knew his grades, test
scores, permanent record *and* genotype, we could make an even better
prediction: still, this is interesting.

As usual we have public intellectuals fulfilling their duties: trying to
stuff falsehoods into the heads of the general public.

Paige Harden has a piece in the New York Times. She has a hard row to
hoe: she’s trying to convince her fellow ‘progressives’ that they need
to recognize that genetic influences on personality and talent are real
and strong. She bullshits on some topics in order to reassure them:
mentions the awful idea that inferior genes explain poverty, and evil
old eugenics. But of course genes *do* have a role in inequality, while
there’snothing wrong with non-coercive eugenics, as long as you know
what you’re doing.

She mentions that a number of leftists that have opposed this kind of
biological research, for instance on education. Which is fairly weird,
really: clearly those objecting believe that the theories they base
their favorite programs on, and teach, are false. Which means their
programs won’t, can’t achieve their stated goals – but that’s
apparently no reason to abandon them. Means justify the ends ?

I can imagine someone opposing certain kinds of research because the
results might be dangerous – say an easy way to make a total conversion
bomb out of the green stuff in the back of the fridge, or a
complexly-wired helmet that confers the power of telepathic hypnosis, so
that the wearer automatically becomes Supreme Ruler of Everybody, but I
don’t think that’s what’s going on here.

Harden argues that genetic inequality is unfair, and so ->
redistribution. The earlier argument was that everybody is really the
same, and so -> redistribution. I’m pretty sure that if the
astronomers found that an asteroid the size of Texas was going to hit us
in twenty years, that answer to that would also be massive
redistribution. What does she says about the boring topic of making
society actually work better – where well-understood genetic influences
could have a role? Nothing, of course.

Lastly, Harden says that a better understanding understanding of genetic
influence will let us develop a better understanding of which effects
are genetic and which are not ( ”the causal effects of the environment
are thrown into sharper focus”). So we can find the environmental
interventions that work !

That, lady, is bullshit. Essentially every conceivable social
intervention is like things parents do – shared family environment. And
every decent study indicates that shared family environment doesn’t
matter much. Now, I suppose we could try to develop a new social
program that mimics the effects of non-shared environment – which
effects are significant – but we are handicapped by not knowing what the
fuck those non-shared environmental influences even are.

Of course, If I were a professor of psychology, that would be a pleasing
prospect. ” More research is needed” – until the end of time.
