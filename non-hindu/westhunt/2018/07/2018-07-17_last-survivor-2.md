Last Survivor

It seems that although the Amerindians had dogs (after a while), those
puppies did very poorly after Columbus. Modern dog breeds have
slim-to-no ancestry of this kind ( from comparisons with ancient dog
DNA) . You have to suspect infectious disease. However, one descendant
is still going strong: it turns out that canine venereal sarcoma, the
cell line infection or contagious cancer, originated in a North American
dog: it’s closely related to those old Injun dogs and shows a bit of
coyote introgression!

I had made a similar suggestion a few years back: I said that there
still might be living Neanderthals ( contagious ones, I was thinking )
and challenged some readers to guess how. After two years, none had, so
I relented and gave them a hint: “What for you bury me in the cold, cold
ground?”
