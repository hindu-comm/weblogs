Lossless Compression

In my review, I complained a bit about Zimmer being prolix. Here is an
example. In Chapter 4, “Atta Girl” , if you strip out the
human-interest anecdotes, he’s saying

“Mendelian diseases exist and can be serious. They’re usually
recessive. Sometimes we can do something for the kids, but generally
not. PKU is bad. ” 24 words: Zimmer takes about 11,000.
