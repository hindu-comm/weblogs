Epstein-Barr

Epstein-Barr causes mono, but it also causes a goodly fraction of
lymphomas (Hodgkins, Non-Hodgkins; Burkittâ€™s lymphoma) and
nasopharyngeal cancer (common in south China), while dramatically
increasing the risk for a host of autoimmune diseases (multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), and celiac disease). You can bet it causes yet other
problems.

Long past time for a vaccine.
