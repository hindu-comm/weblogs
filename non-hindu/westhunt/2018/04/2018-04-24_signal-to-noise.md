Signal to Noise

Can you dismiss an argument because the originator is a bad person?
Obviously not. But if the originator lies a lot, or simply doesn’t know
jack about anything, the probability that the argument is worth anything
can be low, so that it might not be among the first 100,000 things on
your must-read list.

I mean, it’s perfectly possible to have a valid mathematical theorem
emerge from Johnson noise, but what are the odds?
