Round Up The Usual Suspects

Some time ago I
[mentioned](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/murder-at-harvard/)
an odd unsolved murder, at Harvard, back in 1969.

One of our loyal readers noticed that the case has just been
[solved](https://www.boston25news.com/news/who-killed-jane-britton-50-year-murder-investigation-finally-closed/875994868).
DNA – what can’t it do?

Nothing very unusual about the perp, or the crime.
