Eemian agriculture?

Agriculture emerged in several different places around the world not too
long after the current interglacial began. At least some of those starts
were independent, not inspired from others: certain agriculture
originated independently in the New World.

But in the last interglacial, about 120,000 years ago, it apparently
didn’t happen anywhere. At least I know of no evidence for it. And
it’s surely true that there no technological civilization arose back
then, because we’d find various kinds of lasting trash.

So.. but could there have been a try or two that didn’t spread far,
didn’t prosper? False dawns? Some kinds of agriculture, like root
crops, don’t leave a huge signature.

There might be hints in the genome. Assuming a decent human skeleton of
the right vintage, we could look for signs of adaptation to
agriculture. We know something about the genes that change in
domestication syndrome: maybe we could find hints that somebody tamed
wolves back in the day. One can even imagine an older kind of
agriculture that was closer to instinctive: ants and termites farm
without being very smart.
