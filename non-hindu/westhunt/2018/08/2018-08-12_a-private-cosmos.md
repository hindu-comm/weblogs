A Private Cosmos

There are false things that most believe, and other false things that
many people believe. One less-examined category are false things
believed by, say just one guy. The things I’m thinking about aren’t
ones that readily fall into classic categories of mental illness.

While participating in an impromptu protest against Bill Clinton (
playing golf across the road from us) we ran into an interesting
couple. The wife with the Mitteleuropean accent was aghast, telling us
that we couldn’t say things like that, but the husband was silly in a
far more interesting way. He \[ turned out to be a small player in local
Democratic politics\] started explaining how France’s loss at Dien Bien
Phu was due to Eisenhower’s personal hatred of DeGaulle – the reason we
wouldn’t help the French. I pointed out that the US *had* heavily
funded the French effort in Indochina (\~2.5 billion, back when a dollar
was worth something) and that DeGaulle didn’t have any role in the
French government during this period – he didn’t make a comeback until
1958. Didn’t matter: he was sure.

In real life, Ike and DeGaulle got on rather well.

I think such individual delusions are fairly common. Once in a while
they spread.
