Economists and Merkel’s migrants

Someone polled a number of prominent economists whether the influx of
refugees into Germany beginning in 2015 will generate net economic
benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.

About half said yes, a little less than than half were unsure. 2%
disagreed.

As of late 2017, the job status was as following:

\~20% had any job.

\~largely those were low-skilled jobs

Now you have to understand that Germany is a fairly plush welfare
state, one that spends a lot of money on its inhabitants. School,
medical care, housing, the whole ball of wax. In order to be a net
contributor, you have to have a pretty high income. Even higher, if
we’re thinking of someone being a net contributor over a lifetime – you
have to consider retirement and old-age costs. The occasional gaudy
acts of terrorism hardly help: protection is costly. Maybe it boosts
GDP like an epidemic of broken windows?

Next, your typical Syrian or Afghani immigrant doesn’t speak German and
doesn’t have a lot of human capital: he isn’t a fresh graduate of a
German technical high school. If typical of his home country, he has an
IQ in the 80s. He finds both beer and blood sausage abhorrent – fitting
in is difficult.

The birth rates are very low in Germany and the big companies would
like more skilled labor. But after a year, out of a million-some
refugees, less than 100 got jobs in those big German companies.

So.. On this not-terribly-difficult, not-terribly rare kind of problem,
economists are worse than useless. I could put it more strongly !
