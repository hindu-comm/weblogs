Gaussian anomaly

Intelligence is highly heritable- so generally, when someone is far
smarter than average, his parents are at least somewhat above average.

But Gauss’s parents sure looked ordinary: his father had menial jobs
such as gardener and street butcher, while his mother was barely
literate. Nonpaternity is not very common, but it is more likely if a
kid is vastly different from his parents: and Gauss (arguably the
greatest mathematician of all time) *was* vastly different. Perhaps the
most different kid in history.

So if we dug him up and sequenced him, we might discover something
interesting. In the immortal words of Zuckerberg: “He’s not your dad.”
Maybe.

Generalizing this case has obvious implications.
