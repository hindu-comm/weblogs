Hollywood physics

In real life, gasoline-powered cars don’t often explode. But in the
movies. cars are always exploding. Although I’m still waiting for the
scene in which three cars simultaneously fly off cliffs and collide in
mid-air. And explode.

In real life, bullets don’t have much momentum. But in Hollywood, they
can pick you up and slam you against the wall. Although the shooter
isn’t flung back: Dean Drive?

The question: how should Hollywood deal with the electric car? Sure,
lithium batteries can catch on fire, but the whole point is that we
aren’t strictly limited by the laws of physics. Wouldn’t it be better
if crashed Teslas were covered with crawling electric discharges,
electrocuting everyone in the car, then building up through multicolored
lightning to complete vaporization?
