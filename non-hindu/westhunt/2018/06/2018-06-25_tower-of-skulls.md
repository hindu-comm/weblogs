Tower of Skulls

For many years, anthropologists \[ many of them\] have doubted
traditional accounts of human sacrifice, cannibalism, torture, and
general irritability among MesoAmerican Indians – mainly the Aztecs and
Maya.

Progress in archaeology and the translation of the Mayan script have
greatly weakened this trend. When you find towers of skulls, racks of
skulls, skull masks, you start to think that something about the Aztec
empire wasn’t exactly kosher. Same when you find skeletons of young
women at the bottom of Mayan cenotes.



Who to believe? Conquistadors. And Bernal Diaz is fun: he had a hell
of a story to tell.
