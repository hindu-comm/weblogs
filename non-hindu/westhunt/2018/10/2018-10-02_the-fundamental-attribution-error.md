The Fundamental Attribution Error

“In[social
psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology "Social psychology"),**fundamental
attribution error**(**FAE**), also known as**correspondence
bias**or**attribution effect**, is the concept that, in contrast to
interpretations of their own behavior, people tend to (unduly) emphasize
the agent’s internal characteristics (character or intention), rather
than external factors, in explaining other people’s behavior. This
effect has been described as “the tendency to believe that what people
do reflects who they are”.

Which is why such things aren’t significantly heritable – except that
they are. Reminds me of when my sophomore geometry teacher told me, at
the beginning of the class: “You’ll do well.” I asked how he could
tell? He said ” I taught your mother.” He knew more than Lee Ross.

If we constructed the right PRS \[an index of wishful thinking?\] ,
social psychologists would, on average, have unusual scores. In a
better world, we would never employ that kind of person as a social
psychologist.
