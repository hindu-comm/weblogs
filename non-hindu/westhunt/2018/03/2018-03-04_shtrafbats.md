Shtrafbats

Was thinking about how there are far too many reviewers, and far too few
movies worth reviewing. It might be fun to review the movies that should
have been made, instead. Someone ought to make a movie about the life of
[Konstantin
Rokossovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rokossovsky) – an
officer arrested and tortured by Stalin (ended up with denailed fingers
and steel teeth) who became one of the top Soviet generals. The story
would be focused on his command of 16th Army in the final defense of
Moscow – an army group composed entirely of penal battalions. The Legion
of the Damned.
