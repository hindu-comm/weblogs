Physical Anthropology: they already knew

All of Southeast Asia was occupied, relatively recently, (\~6000 years
ago) by populations that were genetically close to the Andamanese and to
the funny admixture fraction in Brazilian Amerindians. Closer than
anyone else, anyhow.

I’m sorry. I guess I didn’t yet read that ancient DNA paper on Southeast
Asia.

[Here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/08/278374) it is.
“We find that early genomes from Hoabinhian hunter-gatherer contexts in
Laos and Malaysia have genetic affinities with the Onge hunter-gatherers
from the Andaman Islands, while Southeast Asian Neolithic farmers have a
distinct East Asian genomic ancestry related to present-day
Austroasiatic-speaking populations. We also identify two further
migratory events, consistent with the expansion of speakers of
Austronesian languages into Island Southeast Asia ca. 4 kya, and the
expansion by East Asians into northern Vietnam ca. 2 kya.”
