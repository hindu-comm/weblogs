2018

I was talking with one of my boys about how unsatisfactory the current
year is – how we got the wrong future. Bruce Jenner instead of flying
cars. The wrong Solar System too – no advanced but declining humanoid
civilization on Mars, no jungle princesses wearing fur bikinis on Venus.
Then I talked about a book by James Blish set in 2018, where we’re
building a Bridge on Jupiter, out of frozen ammonia and Ice-7 and other
materials frequently found in the Jovian aisle at Home Depot – with the
aim of doing some weird gravitational experiment. We get the key data,
let the Bridge disintegrate, and before you know it faster-than-light
ships are buzzing around all the nearby star systems.

So I was bitching about 2018. Then Ben pointed out that there were still
more than nine months left in the year.
