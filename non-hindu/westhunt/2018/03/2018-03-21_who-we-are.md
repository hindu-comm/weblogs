Who We Are

I’m going to review David Reich’s new book, [Who We Are and How We Got
Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/110187032X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=the10000yeaex-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=110187032X&linkId=43a073093cd4f0d8da15ff6f77f4b538).
Extensively: in a sense I’ve already been doing this for a long time.
Probably there will be a podcast. The GoFundMe link is
[here](https://www.gofundme.com/who-we-are-and-how-we-got-here). You can
also send money via Paypal (Use the donate button), or bitcoins to
1Jv4cu1wETM5Xs9unjKbDbCrRF2mrjWXr5. In-kind donations, such as
orichalcum or mithril, are always appreciated.

This is *the* book about the application of ancient DNA to prehistory
and history.
