Better off dead

A recent
[paper](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2017/09/14/finding-the-source/)
on the origin of sickle-cell was being discussed, and an interesting
question was posed \[ by Razib Khan\]: why haven’t modifier genes
emerged that reduce the bad effects in homozygotes?

Let me say something about those bad effects. The most important one is
that someone with sickle-cell disease usually has a ruined spleen before
the end of childhood – infarcts. This enormously increases the risk from
encapsulated organisms like pneumococcus: in a place or time without
effective medical care, this kills you. There are all kinds of other
problems that eventually show up if effective medical care gets you over
that first hump, but in the past, and in many places today, kids with
sickle-cell diseases usually didn’t make it past two.

What about a mutation that led to a milder form, one with the same
positive effects in heterozygotes but that that killed homozygotes at
age five, instead of two? It would not be favored by selection: five
year olds don’t produce any offspring, and they use up more parental
resources. Killing homozygotes rapidly (as opposed to slowly) increases
the fitness of the sickle-cell allele – it lets the parents start over
and produce another kid, who might be a carrier.

There’s a malaria defense in Southeast Asia, Melanesian ovalocyosis,
that goes all the way – homozygotes die before birth.
