Denisovan-Neanderthal hybrid

They’ve found a Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid. But they should have been
rare, very rare, less than one per generation: if not, the two groups
could not have accumulated lots of neutral-genome differences, which
they did.

Possible explanation: hybridization was happening in a population sink.

Neanderthals and Denisovans checked in, but they didn’t check out.
