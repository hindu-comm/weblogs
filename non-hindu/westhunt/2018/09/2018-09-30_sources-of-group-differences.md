Sources of group differences

Plomin is and always has been careful not to talk about questions
outside his immediate research, because they’d get him in trouble. He
reaps more than enough trouble just doing his job. So much so that he
sometimes says ridiculous things just to avoid trouble, like saying that
nobody knows what causes male-female differences. It is to laugh. Yeah,
we know that one.

What about inter-population differences in personality and
intelligence? Are they driven by mystic factors insusceptible to the
scientific method, as Mr. T suggests? Of course not. Since they exist in
populations going to the same schools, eating approximately the same
food, watching similar TV – since they show up by age three – you can
rule out a lot of causative factors. Generally, anything that would
fall into the shared-environment category doesn’t seem to explain it,
just as it doesn’t explain within-pop differences. In most developed
countries anyhow: in some places factors like iodine deficiency play a
role.

We could talk about structural racism, but since it does not exist, why
bother? I’d rather talk about the aether.

Probably the causes of between-population differences are the same kind
of genetic factors that explain most variation between individuals in a
population – systematic differences in the frequencies of many alleles
of small effect. Probably this explains the differences between
populations that lived in different eras as well: with better recovery
of ancient DNA, we might be able to detect historical trends.

Could genetic differences have an effect on the flavor of culture in
different populations? Well, even allowing for differences in
intelligence: sure. Identical twins like the same things, pick similar
clothes, read similar authors: genetically different populations
could and must have different tastes and preferences, on average.
