The body under the rug

When I was a senior in high school, I wrote a little essay in which I
noted that things had gone too easily for the Western allies after the
first couple of years of WWII. We often surprised them, they seldom
surprised us. I’ve never seen an example of a historian saying that
before 1974, when the facts about Ultra started to come out. There were
people – Germans – that noticed in WWII. They figured that there was
some kind of intelligence leak, but they couldn’t figure out what it
was. The guys running their machine cryptography assured them that it
was unbreakable.

I think that there were some historians that didn’t mention it because
they knew all about it – people like Samuel Eliot Morison. But most
historians didn’t have that WWII experience, weren’t read in, and they
never saw it ( I’m open to correction on this).

Why the hell could I see this when they couldn’t?
