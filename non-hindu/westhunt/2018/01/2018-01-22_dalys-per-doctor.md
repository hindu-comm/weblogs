DALYs per doctor

The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a measure of overall disease
burden – the number of years lost. I’m wondering just much harm
premodern medicine did, per doctor. How many healthy years of life did a
typical doctor destroy (net) in past times?

Consider Semmelweis. Between 1839 and 1847, the First Clinic at the
Vienna General Hospital had 20,204 births and 1,989 maternal deaths. The
Second Clinic, attended by midwives, had 17,791 birth and 691 maternal
deaths. An MD’s care conferred an extra 6% chance of death. Births at
home were even safer, with maternal mortality averaging about 0.5%

In that period, MDs caused about 1200 extra deaths. Today ob-gyns
deliver about 12-15 babies per month; assuming that caseloads were
similar back then, there would have been something like 14 doctors
working there ( a very rough guess: 2500 births a year, 180 births per
doctor). So each MD was responsible for something like 85 extra deaths
over that period. Since some were students, who surely didn’t spend the
whole 8 years there, probably the per-doctor fatality rate was less that
that. Maybe only 50 deaths per doc. Of course a doctor’s career was
longer than 8 years…  
Assuming 30 years of life lost per mom, 1500 DALYs per Victorian ob-gyn
sounds like a minimum.

Ob-Gyn was especially bad, but most doctors, over most of history, must
have had significantly negative effects. We know that wounded men in the
Civil War had a better chance of surviving when they managed to hide
from Army surgeons. Think how many people succumbed to bloodletting,
over the centuries.

It looks as if the average doctor (in Western medicine) killed a bunch
of people over his career ( when contrasted with doing nothing). In the
Charles Manson class.

Eventually the market saw through this illusion. Only took a couple of
thousand years.
