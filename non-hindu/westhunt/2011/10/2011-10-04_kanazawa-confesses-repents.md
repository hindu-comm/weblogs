Kanazawa Confesses, Repents

Andrew Gelman’s [blog](http://andrewgelman.com/) links to an
[article](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2011/09/Kanazawa.aspx)
describing Satoshi Kanazawa’a punishment for posting a blog entry
stating that black women were rated to be less attractive than women of
other races.

As I recall from jounalists’ accounts when the Kanazawa kerfluffle hit
the news Kanazawa did not *say* that black women were less attractive,
he reported on evaluations of attractiveness made by researchers of
participants in some longitudinal study.

The topic is of some applied interest: orthodontists and plastic
surgeons for example would like very much to understand an objective
route to making people attractive.

The resolution by LSE reads like a sophomoric parody of political
correctness run amok. “Disciplinary action” and a public apology for
reporting in a blog about ratings by others? What a poor excuse for a
university LSE must be.
