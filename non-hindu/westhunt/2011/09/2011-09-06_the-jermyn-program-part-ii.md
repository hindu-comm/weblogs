The Jermyn Program (Part II)

The general idea of the
[Jermyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jermyn) Program is that
existing races recapitulate the hominid subspecies circa 100 thousand
years ago. Back then, we had anatomically modern humans (AMH) in some
fraction of subSaharan Africa and the Levant, another unknown but
highly divergent hominid population in central Africa (call them
Mangani), Neanderthals in Europe and western Asia, and Denisovans in
eastern Asia, especially in Sundaland. While today we have Negroids,
Bushmen and Pygmies (Capoid), Caucasoids, Mongoloids & Amerindians, and
Australoids. I see three reasons why the modern races split along the
same lines as those older , much more divergent groups. First, the
geographical and ecological factors that drove isolation before the
expansion of AMH did so again after mostly-modern humans spread over the
world. Second, those mostly-AMH populations were exposed to many of
the same selective pressures as their predecessors, so you expect a
certain amount of convergent evolution. Third, there is reason to
believe that those moderns picked up adaptive alleles from the archaic
populations they displaced â€“ so, to a limited extent, they *are* the the
old subspecies.
