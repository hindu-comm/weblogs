All One Species

We now know that anatomically modern humans with interfertile with
Neanderthals and Denisovans. It seems likely that AMH was interfertile
with a very divergent African group whose genes show up today in Bushmen
and Pygmies. Almost certainly, Neanderthals and Denisovans were
interfertile.

Of course all of this was overwhelmingly likely even before we found
genetic evidence. Mammalian lineages with such time-depths of separation
are almost always interfertile.

Judging from these facts, all these groups – and more – would be members
of the same biological species, in Ernst Mayr’s definition. What can we
conclude from this?

Nothing. We know that the reproductive systems of these groups are
compatible, but that’s what we started with. Can we conclude that
Neanderthal behavior was really more like ours than the archaeological
record suggests, because of this biological compatibility? No. Can we
conclude that Denisovans had technological capabilities other than those
shown in known East Asian artifacts? Nope.
