Stupid Penguins

I said this about Bush a few years ago:

> If the President had decided (because of a stroke with truly
> interesting side effects) that we could no longer stand idly by in the
> eternal conflict between penguins and skuas ( penguins = Good, skuas =
> Evil) and sent an expeditionary force to Antarctica, an expedition in
> which a thousand soldiers froze to death and ten thousand others lost
> limbs to frostbite – an expedition that cost one hundred billion
> dollars, a conflict in which the skuas and blizzards left the issue in
> doubt, one in which we discovered that penguins are thoroughly
> unlikable when you get to know them better – if he had done this
> instead of invading Iraq, the country would be substantially better
> off than it is today.
