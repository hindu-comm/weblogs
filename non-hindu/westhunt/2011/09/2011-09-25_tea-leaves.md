Tea Leaves

The new paper in Science about an Australian genome (An Aboriginal
Australian Genome Reveals Separate Human Dispersals into Asia) hints at
something new. Comments in the supplement (and by Ann Gibbon) suggest
that the Denisovans may stem from *Homo erectus*, at least in part,
rather than being a sister group to Neanderthals as suggested in the
paper by Reich and Patterson back in December. In the supplement, the
authors suggest that they may be a sister clade to the last common
ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. Ann Gibbons say the same,
concerning the Denisovan girl whose pinky we found: “She was not a
modern human, but a descendant of Homo erectus, an ancestral species
that left Africa almost 2 million years ago. ”

Denisovan mtDNA is deeply diverged from modern human or Neanderthal
mtDNA, while the Denisovan teeth found look strangely old-fashioned.
Moreover, it now looks as if admixture between hominid subspecies is the
norm rather than the exception.  So, although Denisovans as an
admixture between *H. erectus* and some branch of Neanderthals was
always a possibility, evidence, signs, and portents are starting to
make it look likely.
