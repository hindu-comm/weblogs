Archaic HLA alleles

David Reich doubts the Denisovan origin of some HLA class-1 alleles,
apparently because they have higher frequencies on the Asian mainland,
while ( according to interviews) he has only found Denisovan ancestry
among the peoples of island southeast Asia and Melanesia (and probably
Australia). However, the amount of admixture required to pass an
advantageous gene is very low.

Imagine that a given allele (an HLA allele in this case) has a 5%
selective advantage. A single copy then has a 10% chance of reaching
high frequency. So admixture of a single Denisovan individual could
well be enough, which would probably correspond to an admixture level
well under a tenth of a percent – too low for Reich to measure.

Or it might be the case that the first wave of anatomically modern
humans entering east Asia admixed with Denisovans at the few-percent
level, but that first wave was later displaced by a later wave (or
waves) with low Denisovan admixture. Presumably the second wave would
admix with the first at the few-percent level, which would almost erase
the original Denisovan component. However, adaptive alleles don’t stay
at their original low frequency. In that scenario, adaptive HLA alleles
of Denisovan origin might have already been common in the first wave
(\~tens of percent) before the second wave hit.
