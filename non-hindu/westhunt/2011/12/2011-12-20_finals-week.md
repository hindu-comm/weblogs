Finals Week

I have a 15 year old with several undesirable traits. We had an intense
discussion two days ago about whether “clothes picked up from the floor
in your room” is satisfied by “dirty clothes simply kicked under the
bed.” I prevailed, but an hour or so later he gave me a note saying
“Here is your Christmas message, Dad.”

Here is his note. This is the Christmas midterm for our readers. What
does the note say?
