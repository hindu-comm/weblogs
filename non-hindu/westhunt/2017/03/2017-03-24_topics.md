Topics

I will probably be doing another podcast with James Miller soon.
Suggestions are welcome. I’m considering reviewing more dreadful yet
influential books and/or articles: readers have already suggested some,
such as Jonathan Marks’ new book, and that article about twin studies in
Slate. I would, I think, include books that are seriously wrong but not
utter dreck. The candidates should include books that are not brand-new
– I could diss The Republic, for example.  
Name a book.

I will run gofundme or similar appeals for these efforts: I gotsta get
paid.
