Situational Joke

An anthropologist was telling me about a legend – that once upon a time,
there was a successful chimp-human hybrid. Back in the 1920s, at the
Yerkes National Primate Center at Emory University. This might sound
impossible, since the chromosomes don’t match, while the two species
have been diverging for six million years or more. But then horses and
donkeys don’t have the same number of chromosomes, yet mules exist. And
some crazy Saudis have managed (after many tries) to produce a couple of
hybrids between llamas and camels, which split about 11 million years
ago.

So I’m telling you there’s a chance.

More important, I found out that the anthropologist in question had
never heard a particularly relevant joke, the one about the Irishman and
the gorilla. Seems that a zoo in Chicago had a rare albino gorilla, the
last of its subspecies. A lady gorilla. So they decided to breed it with
a human: they put an add in the Trib:”Man to breed with rare gorilla,
ten thousand dollars.” Thee next day Paddy shows up and talks to them.
“I’ll do it, but with three conditions. I don’t have to kiss the gorilla
on the lips, the children will be raised in the Church, and you give me
a week to come up with the ten thousand dollars.”
