how big was the edge?

One consideration in the question of what drove the Great Divergence
\[when Europe’s power and wealth came to greatly exceed that of the far
East\] is the extent to which Europe was already ahead in science,
mathematics, and engineering. As I have said, at the highest levels
European was already much more intellectually sophisticated than China.
I have a partial list of such differences, but am interested in what my
readers can come up with.

What were the European advantages in science, mathematics, and
technology circa 1700? And, while we’re at it, in what areas did
China/Japan/Korea lead at that point in time?
