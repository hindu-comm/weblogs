Behavioral genetics and the judicial system

Making things better in the long run in not really an objective of the
justice system, since the mental universe of those running it has no
picture of how that could be done. But it may have happened anyway: over
the past few thousand years, unusually violent and uncooperative people
have been heavily sat on by the authorities, which had to reduce their
evolutionary fitness, at least to some degree.  
Hanging does that.

If this was the case, it was due to the fact that criminals aren’t
entirely formed by environment: crime is moderately heritable. So if you
scrag assholes, gradually the population as a whole slowly changes
towards a lower genetic tendency to criminality. You get fewer assholes.
Whether this has actually happened in a particular population, and to
what extent, would depend on the severity and frequency of state
punishment, the length of time this pattern existed, and so on. It may
or may not have been significant in a particular population, depending
on local history – although there is some reason to believe that
something like this may been going on for a very long time (human
self-domestication). It’s possible that this trend occasionally
reversed.

I have no reason to believe that this was planned. If you look at the
trend today, you might get the impression that the powers that be are
actively trying to increase the fitness of assholes, but I doubt if that
is the case. Sure, that’s the effect, but they don’t know enough to do
it on purpose.

For example, when the Supremes decided that being sufficiently stupid is
a get-out-of-execution card, they weren’t thinking about long-term
biological implications. I doubt if they ever do, or can.

A thought experiment: in the light of behavioral genetics, what should
you do when it’s clear that one of a pair of identical twins has
committed a truly heinous crime – but you don’t know which one?
