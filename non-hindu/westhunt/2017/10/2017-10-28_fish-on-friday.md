Fish on Friday

There are parts of Europe, Switzerland and Bavaria for example, that are
seriously iodine deficient. This used to be a problem. I wonder if fish
on Friday ameliorated it: A three-ounce serving size of cod provides
your body with 99 micrograms of iodine, or 66% of the recommended amount
per day.

Thinking further, it wasnâ€™t just Fridays: there were \~130 days a years
when the Catholic Church banned flesh.
