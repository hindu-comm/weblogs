Orcas

Orcas, killer whales, have occasionally attacked (and in a few cases
killed) their trainers, but to the best of my information, no human
being has ever been eaten by an orca.

Why the fuck not? Are we not good enough for them?

This also implies that no orca has ever eaten a black person. There can
be only one explanation.
