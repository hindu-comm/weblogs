Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

It now looks as if the majority of the genetic variance in IQ is the
product of mutational load, and the same may be true for many
psychological traits. To the extent this is the case, a lot of human
psychological variation must be non-adaptive. Maybe some personality
variation fulfills an evolutionary function, but a lot does not. Being a
dumb asshole may be a bug, rather than a feature. More generally, this
kind of analysis could show us whether particular low-fitness syndromes,
like autism, were ever strategies – I suspect not.

It’s bad new news for medicine and psychiatry, though. It would suggest
that what we call a given type of mental illness, like schizophrenia, is
really a grab-bag of many different syndromes. The ultimate causes are
extremely varied: at best, there may be shared intermediate causal
factors. Not good news for drug development: individualized medicine is
a threat, not a promise.

On the other hand, this bodes well for our secret project aimed at
‘accidentally’ creating a super-Neanderthal.
