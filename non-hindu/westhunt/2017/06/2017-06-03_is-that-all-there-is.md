Is that all there is?

Testosterone Rex is a really stupid book. Interesting that none of the
Establishment reviewers noticed. Anyhow, I was talking with a friend,
and he opined that this is always the case – all the books by
self-professed feminists are stupid. Since the world doesn’t work the
way they’d like it to, this might seem inevitable, but on other
questions I have to say that at least some of the people pushing false
theories do a technically better job, are more proficient obscurers of
the truth. For example, when Lewontin said that most genetic variation
in humans is within-group \[true\] and therefore Pygmies can’t really be
short \[but they are short\], he was pushing something untrue, but he
didn’t sound nearly as dumb as Cordelia Fine when she claims that a guy
getting tons of nookie won’t end up with extra kids.

If there are counterexamples, tell me.
