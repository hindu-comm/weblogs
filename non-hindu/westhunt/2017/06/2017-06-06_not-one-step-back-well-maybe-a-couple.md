Not One Step Back! – well, maybe a couple

Often you can come up with better explanation by taking a wider view.
For example, I’ve heard people suggest that Europeans have lower IQs
than Ashkenazi Jews because of priestly celibacy.  
But a broader perspective suggests that is not key: lots of populations
that never had anything like priestly celibacy score lower and
accomplish less than Western Europeans. Western Europeans aren’t
anomalously dumb – Ashkenazi Jews are anomalously smart. Look for an
explanation based on their genetics and history, not someone else’s .

In the same way, when looking at the wave of extinctions in North
America about 12,000 years ago, the story becomes clearer if you
consider the extinctions in South America ( a bit later), in the
Caribbean islands ( thousands of years later), in Australia ( about
46,000 years ago) , on Madagascar and New Zealand, on various oceanic
islands ( flightless birds disappear in Oceania and the Azores): the
common factor is the arrival of modern humans.

Similarly, when considering the origin of cognitive differences between
racial groups in the US, a wider perspective is helpful. Probably low
scores in Zimbabwe are not caused by structural racism or implicit bias.
You might want to blame Mugabe – but scores are similarly low throughout
sub-Saharan Africa.
