Simulations

I like simulations: I’ve written lots of them. I’ve used them to
understand questions better – questions like the electronic structure of
semiconductors, the evolution of Ashkenazi intelligence, and methods of
combining adaptive optics and imaging processing.

There are systems that are hard to simulate: stuff that’s highly
nonlinear, or where the some of the key factors are poorly understood
and/or poorly measured, when the required calculations grow
exponentially, etc.

There are also systems that can be simulated essentially perfectly. The
relevant physical laws are known exactly, as are the system parameters –
while the required computations scale nicely.

This is the case for optics: there are codes that can accurately predict
the performance of conventional optical systems. I used to work in an
optical design shop \[EDSG, part of Hughes Aircraft\] where they did
this every day.

Once they had designed and built a prototype of a periscope-type system
(for an AFV, if memory serves). A general arrived for the big demo and
looked at a target through the prototype.  
“It’s upside down.”, he said. and so it was. That’s why they pay these
guys the big bucks.

The prototype had only been tested on a crosshair reticle: looked the
same upside down as right side up. Fixed with a prism.

To err is human, true in writing sims as well as everywhere else in
life: but tests can expose those errors.
