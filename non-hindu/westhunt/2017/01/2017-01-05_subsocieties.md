Subsocieties

Every now and then a group secedes from general society and goes its own
way. Sometimes they end up living a very different kind of life. Less
often, that different way of life persists.

Iâ€™m thinking of the Puritans, the Quakers, the Amish, the Oneida
Community, the Nation of Islam, California communes, and of course the
Harshmanites.

Do those different ways of life influence intelligence? According to the
sociologists they could, and maybe should. According to the
psychometricians and behavioral geneticists, they could if they had
differential recruitment \[ immediate results\] , or if they were
reproductive isolated and had different internal selective pressures \[
slow \].

Has there been such a change caused by the new social environment? In
other words, could such a subsociety just *decide* to be smarter?
