Islam and the Americas

I was thinking about the Islamic response to the discovery of the
Americas.

As far as I can tell, there wasn’t any. They absorbed new crops like
maize, and new diseases like syphilis, but I can’t think of a case in
which a ship from any Islamic country as much as visited the New World
for hundreds of years.

You’d think that there would have been Islamic pirates & slavers in the
Caribbean: they raided as far as England and Iceland, but I can’t think
of an example. Or sent people (possibly in disguise) to trade, or just
out of curiosity. Maybe a Sephardic Jew who could pass for a Spaniard,
with a composite bow and a Koran in his sea-chest, intent on stirring up
trouble in New Spain…  
But it never happened.

Before the Iberians, nobody (other than the Vikings in the far north)
had ever gone far into the Atlantic (or if they did, they never came
back). The Canaries were known as far back as Classical times, and
settled, but then the closest is only 60 miles off the African coast.
But there was nobody on Madeira, nobody in the Azores, nobody in the
Cape Verde Islands.
