Teratomas

There exists a weird kind of cancer called a teratoma, whose cells seem
to think that they are in an embryo. These cancers differentiate;
develop hair, teeth, skin, all manner of messy things. They exist in
humans and animals. Some very odd guy wondered if teratoma cells, which
seem to want to be an embryo, would actually become one if given a
favorable environment. He implanted teratoma cells into an early-stage
rat embryo; the teratoma cells there experienced the proper chemical
cues and developed into part of a rat. He ended up with a piebald rat â€“
some of the cells had a regular rat mom and dad, while other parts were
descended from a cancer propagated in a tissue culture. The rat was
fine. I first ran into this report the very same afternoon that I read
*The Boys from Brazil*.
