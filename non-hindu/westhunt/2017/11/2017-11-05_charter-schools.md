Charter Schools

I noticed an article by Megan McArdle, [We Libertarians Were Really
Wrong About School
Vouchers](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-23/we-libertarians-were-really-wrong-about-school-vouchers)
. She says “it was reasonable to think,in 1997, that voucher programs
could change the world. ”

No, it wasn’t. You had to be a complete fool to think that, operating on
a substantially incorrect model of what makes people tick.

I never expected charter schools to have any significant effect. And
they don’t.
