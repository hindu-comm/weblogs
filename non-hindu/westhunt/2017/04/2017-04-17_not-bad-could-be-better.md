Not bad. Could be better.

There’s a new
[interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/13/a-feminist-biologist-discusses-gender-differences-in-the-animal-kingdom/#4129106e19b5)
with Suzanne Sadedin, a feminist biologist. She’s about a million times
more sensible than Cordelia Fine, when it comes to differences between
the sexes in humans. After all, such differences are extremely common in
other species, so an evolutionary biologist expects them, and doesn’t
automatically ascribe them to culture. Sadedin is conservative about
what she knows best.

But there’s an important fact she hasn’t fully taken into account.
Scientists lie, especially if the result reinforces what they want to be
true. Contemporary scientists strongly trend in  
a certain ideological direction, and so there’s a blizzard of false
results pointing in that direction. The replication crisis produces
correlated noise.

Sadedin refers to Daphna Joel’s results on male and female brains, but
that’s bullshit. She says that “Sex-specific differences in certain
abilities tend to show up in studies \[5\] \[ true\], but can often be
eliminated by avoiding certain biasing cues \[6\] \[ more bullshit! \] .
She repeats a recent meme – ” Diversity in decision-making roles leads
to better decisions for groups, organizations and societies \[21\].”
Again, just bullshit. There’s no evidence for it. Since ‘diversity’
generally means adding individuals from low-IQ groups to the mix, what
little evidence we do have is negative.
