Secondary response

After you’ve been exposed to a pathogen, antigen specific memory B Cells
persist. If the pathogen reappears, they quickly pump out antibodies
against that pathogen.

I have the impression that, when this happens, you can feel bushed. I’m
not sure if that impression is correct, but it’s based on various times
that I’ve been hanging around sick kids, doing things for them, without
actually catching the flu or stomach bug they have. When I don’t catch
it, seems likely it’s one that I’ve had before.

Does anyone know if there really is such a response?
