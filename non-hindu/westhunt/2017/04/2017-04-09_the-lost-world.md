The Lost World

[![](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kukenan_tepuy_at_sunset.jpg?w=640)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kukenan_tepuy_at_sunset.jpg)

A while ago I
[mentioned](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/something-hidden/)
that there might be unrecognized survivors of South America’s local
placental lineages (Meridiungulata and Xenarthra). Unrecognized because
very divergent, like golden moles, which are Afrotheria. Shoot, maybe
even metatherians or some relative of necrolestes.

But where to look? Tepuis might be good candidates. They’re remnants of
a sandstone plateau that once covered the area between the north border
of the Amazon basin and the Orinoco. These mesas are isolated from the
surrounding forest and have lots of endemic flora and fauna. Some have
almost constant cloud cover and have hardly been explored.
