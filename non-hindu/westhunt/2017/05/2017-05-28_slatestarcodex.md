Slatestarcodex

Scott Alexander
[talks](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/)
about our
[paper](http://web.mit.edu/fustflum/documents/papers/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf),
Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence. He thinks it a good
explanation of a burst of contributions by Ashkenazi Jews in the exact
sciences in the early 20th century. His guys then comment extensively,
if not always particularly wisely.
