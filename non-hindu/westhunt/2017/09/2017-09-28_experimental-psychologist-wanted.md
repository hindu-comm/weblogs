Experimental Psychologist wanted

I mentioned
[this](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/a-sobering-thought/) a
few years ago: there is reason to suspect that just as an increased
pressures of nitrogen has a narcotic effect, a zero-nitrogen breathing
mixture \[ presumably heliox\] might leave you abnormally sober. On
oxygen, I’ve felt something like that – anyone have the same experience?

Anyhow, someone is interested in checking this out. So I need an
experimental psychologist.
