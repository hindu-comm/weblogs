Age of Discovery: Pandora

In the Age of Discovery, Europeans were playing with fire. Every voyage
of exploration risked bring back some new plague. From the New World,
syphilis, probably typhus and rheumatoid arthritis. From India, cholera.
HIV, recently, from Africa. Comparably important new pests attacking
important crops and domesticated animals also arrived, such as grape
phylloxera (which wiped out most of the vineyards of Europe) and potato
blight ( an oomycete or ‘water mold’, from central Mexico).

If one of those plagues had been as potent as smallpox or falciparum
malaria, you probably wouldn’t be reading this.
