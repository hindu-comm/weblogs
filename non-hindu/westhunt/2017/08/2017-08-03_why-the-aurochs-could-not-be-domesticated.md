Why the Aurochs  could not be domesticated.

” Historical descriptions, like Caesar’s Commentarii de Bello Gallico or
Schneeberger, tell that aurochs were swift and fast, and could be very
aggressive. According to Schneeberger, aurochs were not concerned when a
man approached, but when teased or hunted, an aurochs could get very
aggressive and dangerous, and throw the teasing person into the air, as
he described in a 1602 letter to Gesner.\[9\]”

Much more dangerous than zebras.
