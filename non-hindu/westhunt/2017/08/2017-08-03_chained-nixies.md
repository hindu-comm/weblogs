Chained Nixies

Peer Vries pointed out that Great Britain, after a while, was getting
far more labor power from steam engines that it could ever have gotten
from coerced labor. In 1840 England had 17 million “steam slaves”: 121
million in 1870, and 411 million in 1896.

Just a little earlier the main power sources were water and wind:
watermills and windmills. As late as 1850 water power was “the leading
source of mechanical power on both sides of the Atlantic.”

A detailed county-by-county analysis found \> 65,000 water-powered mills
in the eastern United States by 1840. The distribution looked something
like this:

That kind of water wheel usually produced more than 10 horsepower, with
1 horsepower corresponding to the labor effort of about 28 men. So.. in
1840, in terms of raw power, the North had way more chained nixies (> 18
million) than the South had black slaves( \~2.5 million). And when it
came to industrial production, it showed.
