Old Asians

There is reason to believe that Australo-Melanesians used to occupy a
much larger area than they do today. Let’s define them by their genetic
affinity to that odd genetic trace in Amazonian Amerindians: those
related include Papuans, Aboriginal Australians, Andaman Islanders (
closest), and Negrito groups in Southeast Asia and the Philippines.

Skeletal evidence says that they used to occupy all of Southeast Asia
(probably at least as far north as southern China, fairly recently), and
have been largely replaced by people from further north over the past
few thousand years. Same is the case for the Philippines & most of
Indonesia.

In fact, even further north than that: a skeleton from Tianyuan cave,
not far from Beijing, shows the same genetic trace. From about 40,000
years ago. So it’s more plausible that there was a potential source
population in a more geographically felicitous area ( for settling the
New World) at the proper time ( \~20k BC).

Looking at recombination (roloff) should tell us approximately how long
ago the admixture occurred. I would hope to see rare mtDNA haplotypes in
those Amazonian Indians – Y chromosomes, considerably less likely. I
would expect to see a few alleles from the Australo-Melanesians favored
by selection in South America. By analogy with what we’ve seen with
archaic admixture, stuff like HLA would seem likely.
