SLC24A5, yet again

It’s under selection all over the place: Europe, Ethiopia, and now among
the Bushmen. The advantage can’t be more vitamin D, nor is it associated
with agriculture. It does have other
[effects](http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:2677271). Next, the
haplotype is very long, yet has been around a long time. Shouldn’t be
like that. I was talking with Razib Khan about this a while back: could
be that there is more than one active site on the haplotype? Epistatic?
That you need at least two changes to get the positive effect, whatever
it is? So recombined haplotypes that don’t hold both sites are not
favored?
