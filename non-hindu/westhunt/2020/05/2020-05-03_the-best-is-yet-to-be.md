The best is yet to be

The big mistake people are making is comparing the overall impact of a
bad flu season (like the Hong Kong flu in 1968) – one in which \~50-70%
of the population eventually caught it – with a more virulent epidemic (
higher IFR & higher R0)) that is just beginning ( \< 5% of the US
infected by coronavirus so far. )

Something like comparing the casualties of the first three months of
WWII with the casualties of all of WWI.

Well, they’re making other mistakes too, but then they want to.
