Live Mice

Deng Xiaoping once quoted the old proverb: “It doesn’t matter whether a
cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat.” He was
endorsing what worked, capitalism in that case.

By 2020 standards, that is a profoundly un-American statement. The
***only***thing that matters is whether the cat is black or white.
