IHME projections

arguablywrong has taken a
[look](https://arguablywrong.home.blog/2020/04/02/ihme-projections-are-absurdly-optimistic/)
at the projections the Feds are using for planning. He has some
criticism of some features of their model: unfortunately he is almost
certainly correct.

First, they accept CCP data. I am not sure what actually happened in
Wuhan, but I am sure that A. things were at least as bad as admitted and
B. the CCP (eventually) reacted with overwhelming energy, in a way that
seems to a fit a much bigger disaster than admitted.

AW thinks that deaths are significantly underestimated in several
countries (certainly Italy, Spain, and France) and that IHME errs by not
considering this. Correct.

IHME model assumes that state that do not yet have infection measures
will do so with a week. That would be nice.

They assume that once controls are imposed, the epidemic will shrink
just as fast as it previously grew. If the original R0 is 3, the
post-control R0 must be 1/3rd. Uh, why?

“They assume that state-wide infection controls are equivalent in effect
with the controls the CCP imposed in Wuhan.” AW calls this assumption
crazy, but surely a stronger word is called for. In their first try,
the CCP tried these measures, which are more intense than any yet in the
US:

-   Blocking outward transportation from Wuhan
-   Closing public transit and vehicular traffic inside Wuhan
-   Compulsory mask-wearing in public places
-   Cancellation of public events
-   Self-quarantine of confirmed or suspected cases

That dropped the R0 from around 3.5 to 1.25 – which wasn’t enough. They
moved on to

-   Full quarantine of confirmed or suspected cases (i.e., extraction to
    a separate quarantine site), including contacts of confirmed cases
-   Temperature monitoring of all residents
-   Universal and strict stay-at-home orders for all residents

All of these errors are in the same direction.
