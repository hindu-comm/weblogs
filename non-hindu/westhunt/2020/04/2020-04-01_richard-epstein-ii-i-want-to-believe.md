Richard Epstein II: I Want to Believe

In the original article, on March 16th, he said that Wuflu would kill
less than 500 people in the US.

As falsification loomed, a few days later (March 23rd) , he said it
would kill less than 2500.

On March 24th , he said \< 5000.

Looks as if he’ll have to revise his ‘prediction’ again by Thursday.
