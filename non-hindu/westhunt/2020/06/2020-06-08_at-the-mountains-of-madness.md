At the Mountains of Madness

Just as Robert E. Howard’s
[take](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/the-hyborian-age/) on
prehistory was closer to the truth than the one promulgated by
archaeologists in the past few decades, H.P. Lovecraft’s views on
insanity were more realistic than the common ones in American popular
culture – where people are thought to be driven insane by trauma, where
your mum and dad fuck you up by their actions, rather than their genes.
Lovecraft worried about hereditary taints ( like being descended from
from an ape or the Deep Ones), rather than experiencing poor toilet
training or ‘poverty’ that entails richer material circumstances than
those of ancient kings.

Lovecraft’s personal experience may have shaped his views: both of his
parents died in the same asylum. He thought the truth would drive a man
crazy, but maybe it was the other way around.
