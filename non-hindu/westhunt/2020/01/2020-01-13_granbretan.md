Granbretan

A couple of people have suggested that Dominic Cummings might benefit
from my advice. The general goal, presumably, is making Britain great
again.

Doable? Even to the extent of making GB a major power? I would think
so. No country performs anywhere close to its possible maximum –
there’s a lot of slack to optimize.

Naturally, the first step is putting in a decent dynasty, one with real
royals, with the royal touch, to stop the current epidemic of King’s
Evil in its tracks.
