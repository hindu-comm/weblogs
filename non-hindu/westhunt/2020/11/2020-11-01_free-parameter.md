Free Parameter

What if this coronavirus were 10 times more deadly? 20 times? What if
it hit all ages equally, or was especially lethal to young adults ( like
the 1918 flu)? What if it crippled, like polio?

Would people in those hypothetical scenarios have been as crazy as they
are now,? They are not impossible: the idea that natural selection
tightly limits possible virulence is not correct. In the famous
misapplied example, myxomatosis, virulence in rabbits dropped from \>
99% to \~ 50% – but I wouldn’t quite call that having a cold. And it
involved selection acting on the rabbits, as well – old-fashioned rabbit
strains exhibit much higher than 50% mortality when exposed to current
strains of myxomatosis.

I don’t believe that there’s a reserve supply of sanity that is called
out when it’s truly needed. Not this year, anyhow.
