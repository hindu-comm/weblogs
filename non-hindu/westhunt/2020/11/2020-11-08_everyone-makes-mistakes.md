Everyone makes mistakes

Razib Khan dredged up an article that talked about the role of Japanese
intelligence and/or the Black Dragon Society in furthering the
developing of black nationalist groups before WWII – one such group
eventually developed into the Nation of Islam. Perhaps this accounts for
some of the odd
[Yacub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakub_(Nation_of_Islam)) stuff,
which I’m pretty sure isn’t in the Koran.

But there was a very interesting point mentioned in that article that
Razib did not notice, or perhaps did not find interesting:

“”After Nation of Islam members participated in what was reported as a
human sacrifice, NOI founder W. D. Fard was instructed by Detroit
detectives to leave the city in December 1932. ”

Probably everybody knows about this, except me.
