Richard Epstein: expert commentary.

Richard Epstein has a
[piece](https://www.hoover.org/research/coronavirus-isnt-pandemic) out
on coronavirus. He’s a well-known libertarian legal scholar – even I had
heard of him.

He thinks that the number of cases, worldwide, will peak at under one
million, with total worldwide deaths under 50,000. Total death in the
US should be under 500. \*

There are some errors in his essay. He says that a particular model he
cites in the New York Times does not mention the doubling time. it is of
course implicit in the graph itself, but models routinely estimate this,
and it is only a few days. He say that it does not allow for any
changes in viral toxicity: well, there is no evidence for any, at least
on this short time scale, and it is by no means inevitable that it will
become more benign. In 1918, influenza got \_worse\_ with time. He says
that it doesn’t allow for human behavioral changes: that’s the point of
course, to show what is likely to happen if If This Goes On – if we
don’t do anything, or don’t do much – which course, is exactly what
he’s advocating.

He says that the model does not account for the most vulnerable people
being hit first And it shouldn’t, because there is no evidence that
they \_are\_ hit first, and in fact good evidence that everyone is
susceptible. It is more dangerous in old and ill people, but not more
common, except insofar as there may be significant transmission in
hospitals. In fact there seem to be many cases in children, who are
mostly vectors, rather than victims.

He criticizes the model for not assuming that infections will decline as
the weather gets warmer: but, unfortunately, that doesn’t appear to be
the case either.

He shows some charts of deaths and number infected, but does not
understand that deaths lag cases ( by about three weeks). For example,
he mentions that the number of deaths in New York State was 6 as of
March 16 ( he says 2, from local exposure): but today, March 23rd, one
week later, 43 died from coronavirus.

Epstein mumbles about how natural selection, about which he knows
nothing, is sure to tame the virus. Just as it tamed smallpox and
yellow fever. Maybe he should learn math and read a book. it’s not too
late!

He suggests that the virulent forms of HIV were replaced by milder
forms, after the bathhouses were closed, and that this is a goodly part
of the explanation for HIV’s decline. But that never happened: it was
the protease inhibitor drugs. In Cuba, HIV never became an epidemic at
all, but that was because of Fidel Castro’s libertarian voodoo.

He guessed that that death rate would go down among known cases in
SKorea. But considering that spread had almost stopped ( so the # of
cases was close to constant) , while a fair number of older cases were
still lingering in intensive care, this was unlikely: it would have
required a fair number of resurrections. And in fact case fatality rate
has gone up in SK, as one might expect. It takes time to die.

Almost every substantial point in this essay is incorrect, and all the
errors are in the same direction (minimizing the seriousness of the
epidemic), presumably in the service of opposing expensive shutdowns.
It’s a lawyerly way of arguing: making the “worst appear the better
cause” is a big part of the job.

This essay, does, however, by its very existence, make a subtle and
potent argument for letting the virus have its merry way with us:
Richard Epstein was born in 1943.



-   As I write, the total is 486, with 132 deaths today. Anyone want to
    bet whether it eventually breaks 500?
