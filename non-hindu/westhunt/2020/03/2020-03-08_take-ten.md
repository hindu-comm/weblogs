Take Ten

I’ve been seeing quite a few comments about how coronavirus would only
kill old farts, which would, if anything, be beneficial. I think that
Boomers may have made a mistake by not widely publicizing their “Take
Ten” policy , aimed at dragging as many whippersnappers as possible down
to Hell with us.

We wanted it to be a surprise.
