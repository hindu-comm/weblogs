Math and History

It’s easier to understand what’s going on with Wuflu if you’re used to
visualizing equations and playing with simulations, but knowledge of
relevant history also helps. Knowing the basics about perennial
plagues like smallpox and falciparum malaria , or short-term-visitors
like the English sweat, helps clarify the mind of people that say silly
things about evolution always favoring milder strains that spare the
host: apparently nobody told smallpox about this, since its CFR was
around 30% for thousands of years.

And maybe, if you were familiar with the Plague of Cyprian and the
Antonine Plague, you wouldn’t automatically assume that such things had
to be the result of germ warfare. Unless you were a nut, of course.
