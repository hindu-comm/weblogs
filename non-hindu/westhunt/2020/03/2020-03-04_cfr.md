CFR

You have to consider the situation in which the cases overflow the ICUs
– that is likely to be the typical patient. When you see a CFR based on
the ratio of deaths to known cases, it skews low, because it takes a
while for this to progress to the point of killing people. What you want
is the number of people infected three weeks ago that have died divided
by the number of people that contracted it three weeks ago – and even
that is conservative, because some deaths will take longer.

\> 5%, probably, except where social distancing and lock-down keeps it
from overflowing the ICUs.
