Oxford

Some guys at Oxford suggest that that A. a huge fraction, maybe 50%,. of
the pop in England have already had it ( and are thus immune) , and B.
that the fraction of those infected that get seriously ill is much
smaller than it looks. If both things were true, the death rate numbers
might work out, they say.

If that were the case, you would think that any set of tests would
***show*** a big fraction people with the virus – which is not the
case, even though the samples we’ve tested are high-biased.

But, some say, maybe those hypothetically numerous already-infected
people have already cleared the virus and thus don’t test positive for
it. But that can’t be right either, since for a fast-growing epidemic (
which this clearly is, from the rapid increase in deaths) , the
***majority of all cases are very new*** – less than two weeks old ! So
that is obviously untrue as well.
