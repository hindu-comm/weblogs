The Puppet Masters

I was re-reading this Heinlein classic: it’s about alien parasites that
take over and control people. And no, you don’t have to look at it from
their point of view.

Our heroes have discovered this: they’re about to tell the President.

” At the beginning of a forest fire or an epidemic there is a short time
where a minimum of correct action will contain and destroy. What the
President needed to do the Old Man had already figured out – declare a
national emergency, fence off the Des Moines area, and shoot anyone who
tried to slip out. ”

” The Old Man’s unique gift weas the ability to reason logically with
unfamiliar, hard-to-believe facts as easily as with the commonplace.
Not much, eh? Most minds stall dead when faced with facts that conflict
with basic beliefs ; ” I-just-can’t-believe-it ” is all one word to
highbrows and dimwits alike. ”
