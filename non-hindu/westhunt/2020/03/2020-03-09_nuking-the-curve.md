Nuking the Curve

There has been a lot of talk about ‘flattening the curve’ – slowing down
the rate of growth of Wuflu so that it doesn’t overwhelm health system
capacity. like this:

But this is the wrong idea. You have to get R0 down close to 1.0 ( from
around 3.0) in order to really slow the growth – ordinary influenza
has an R0 of around 1.3 and it grows way too rapidly.

Don’t aim at getting close to 1.0: aim at getting below. Basically, the
region of parameter space that would correspond to ‘flattening the
curve’ is tiny, and 90% of the way to a clear win.

There is no substitute for victory.
