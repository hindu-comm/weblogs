The Thirteenth Battle of the Isonzo

Italy was in WWI for about 1200 days. They lost ( this is one of the
lower estimates) around 317,000 men – those died on the field or were
missing in action.

That’s about 264 per day. Right now, in Italy, deaths are running a
bit over 400 per day.

More to come.
