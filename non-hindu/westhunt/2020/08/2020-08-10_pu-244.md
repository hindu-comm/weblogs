Pu-244

Pu-244 is a relatively long-lived isotope of plutonium, with an 80
million year half life. Once upon a time,someone suggested that the
Cretaceous extinction might have been caused by a nearby supernova: if
so, we should see some Pu-244 around, or so it was thought. We donâ€™t.

But that needs to be revised: it now looks as if Pu-244 is \_not\_ made
in a supernova. Instead, it is probably generated by colliding neutron
stars. So nearby supernova over the past couple hundred million years
are not ruled out, although they are a priori unlikely.

The asteroid/comet explanation for the Cretaceous extinction is still
good.
