Sword of Honour

Early in his Sword of Honour series, Evelyn Waugh’s autobiographical
hero rejoices in the purity of his country’s cause: all the big
dictatorships of Europe are on the other side. The Soviet Union is
actively aiding the Axis – vitiating the British blockade with
megabushels of raw materials, freeing up the Wehrmacht to attack Western
Europe, divvying up Poland, having the local Communist parties strike
defense plants and argue for surrender. The Soviets even asked to join
the Tripartite Pact.

And Guy Crouchback thinks that this is just the greatest thing in the
world.

No compromise !

Because he’s an idiot.

So. Why is Russia the “real threat” to the US, rather than China? Do we
want to make absolutely sure that they never get close enough for us to
catch their cooties? Have the members of the Establishment in Washington
never played a single game of Risk?

Well, maybe they’re idiots too. Probably a different kind of idiot.
