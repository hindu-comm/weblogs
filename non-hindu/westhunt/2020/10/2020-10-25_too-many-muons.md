Too Many Muons

There is a
[notion](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200826113716.htm)
that radiation may be limiting qubit lifetime. Even if you use
low-radiation materials and shielding, you still have to worry about
muons generated by cosmic rays. They are *very* penetrating – some
reach kilometers down into the rock.

If so, we may need to build quantum computers several klicks
underground. The deeper, the better: another factor of ten attenuation
of the muon flux could materially extend qubit lifetime and drastically
improve performance.

We could perhaps use the old Homestake mine in South Dakota, now the
location for DUSEL ([Deep Underground Science and Engineering
Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Science_and_Engineering_Laboratory)
). But it’s only 2.4 km down.

The best mines ( for our purpose) are more than 3 kilometers deep, and a
few approach 4 km. The problem is, of all the [ten deepest
mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deepest_mines) in the
world, only one is in the US.

The United States faces a mine shaft gap.
