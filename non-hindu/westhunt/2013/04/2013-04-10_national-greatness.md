National Greatness

The development of penicillin is one of the greatest triumphs of modern
medicine. People realized that chemotherapy really was practical after
the advent of the sulfa drugs – but they had limitations. Penicillin hit
a much wider spectrum of organisms and had fewer problems with
resistance.

The original development was done in Great Britain \[ Fleming, Florey,
Chain, Heatley, etc.\], but GB was short on resources, and the United
States took up the task of mass production of penicillin. They managed
to ramp up production one-thousand fold between 1943 and 1945, through
deep-tank fermentation, more productive strains, and a better nutrient
solution.

As production rose, availability increased. At first, penicillin was
largely reserved for US and British military needs. Later, it became
available to US and British civilians, and soon after for general usage.

But there was a time window of several months in which
American-produced penicillin was available for American wounded but not
for French casualties. Fortunately, it happens that penicillin is
rapidly excreted in urine. It can be recovered. Between January and
April 1945, Rhône-Poulenc extracted penicillin from the urine of wounded
American servicemen being treated in hospitals around Paris, penicillin
which was then used to treat the wounded of the French Army. They
typically recovered about 100 doses from 300 liters of urine.

When American piss is the elixir of life – ***that*** is national
greatness.
