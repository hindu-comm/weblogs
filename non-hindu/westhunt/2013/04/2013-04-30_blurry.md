Blurry



I was thinking again about the consequences of having more small-effect
deleterious mutations than average. I don’t think that they would push
hard in a particular direction in phenotype space – I don’t believe
they would make you look weird, but by definition they would be bad for
you, reduce fitness. I remembered a passage in a book by Steve
Stirling, in which our heroine felt as if her brain ‘was moving like a
mechanism of jewels and steel precisely formed.’ It strikes me that a
person with an extra dollop of this kind of genetic load wouldn’t feel
like that. And of course that heroine did have low genetic load, being
the product of millennia of selective breeding, not to mention an extra
boost from the Invisible Crown.
