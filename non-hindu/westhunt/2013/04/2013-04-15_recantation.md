Recantation

One of the funnier patterns in modern American life is some individual
stating something true but unsayable, followed by the ritual public
recantation. There are generally unsayable things (a constantly
expanding list), and then there are others that are only unsayable in
particular places or situations.   One of my all-time favorites
involved a New York City public health official talking about AIDS and
homosexuality. He wasn’t saying anything generally verboten – he wasn’t
pointing out that homosexual men are nature’s Petri dishes . He said
this: the health department had previously estimated the number of
homosexual men with AIDS in the Big Apple by doing a survey of the AIDS
rate among gay men and then multiplying by someone else’s estimate of
the prevalence of homosexuality. He announced that further work
indicated that although their estimate of the frequency of AIDS among
homosexual men in New York seemed correct, their new estimate of total
cases was down by half. One of the (sharper) reporters asked ” So,
does this mean that according to your new estimate, there are only half
as many gay men in New York as you previously thought?” The hapless
health official said “Yes, that would follow. ”

There were no really good statistics for the number of gay men anywhere,
but politically active gays found that useful, because they could often
convince politicians that they were more numerous than they actually
were, which increased their influence.  So, there was a very hostile
reaction to that health official’s statement.  After a week or so, he
had to give a press conference. He said ” I said A. there are only
half as many cases as we thought, B. We had the percentage of gay men
infected right C. But I never said that there only half as many gay men
in New York as previously thought. ”

He had been forced to publicly renounce arithmetic.
