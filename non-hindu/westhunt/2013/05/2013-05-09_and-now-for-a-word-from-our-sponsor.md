And now for a word from our sponsor

Running this blog takes time. If you like it, you can help it continue
by contributing. Paypal is already set up. If people want to use a
credit card, I can check out other methods. This might require a
transition to wordpress.org. Checks work: write to gcochran9@comcast.net
for details. Worn, blood-stained tens and twenties are always welcome.
Along with Krugerrands and cans of Spam, which would for sure be
air-dropped on Vanuatu. Just the Spam.

Henry is willing to give the occasional talk for free, as part of his
public education mission. I am willing to give talks for money or some

if you have a puzzle that no one’s been able to solve, I might take a
stab at it – for $$. Particularly if it falls into one my areas of
expertise – algorithm development, signal processing, image recovery,
adaptive optics, simulations, strategic analysis, and genetics (creating
super-Neanderthals, for example). Among other things.

Some

are still available.

If you’d like to see something different on this blog, this is the time
to suggest it. The odds are that I won’t do it, but you never know.

P.P.P.S. there must be other ways of transmitting pseudo-valuta that
haven’t occurred to me. Game gold in WOW? Gift cards? Barter?
