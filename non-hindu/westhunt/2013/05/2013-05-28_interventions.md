Interventions

I’m aiming at a reasonably comprehensive list of documented attempts to
narrow or close IQ gaps between different groups, including planned
interventions and natural experiments. I’d include results – primarily
adult IQ, if we have that information. This being modern times, I hope
to get my readers to do some of the work. Ideally, all of it.

So tell me already.
