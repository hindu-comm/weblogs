Cicada Doom

There is a fungus, *Massospora cicadina*, that attacks periodical
cicadas\[often called 17-year or 13-year locusts\]. First, diploid
resting spores infect cicadas just before they emerge, turning most of
the abdomen into haploid spores while leaving the head and thorax
intact. The cicadas remain active, but become ‘unnaturally sexually
receptive’. Infected males even wing-flick at other males. causing
frequent male-male attempts at copulation. Infected females cannot
complete normal mating and keep wing-flicking at normal males until they
die. Sexual contact, or more exactly pseudo-sexual contact \[half the
abdomen has fallen off\], seems to be important in spreading the haploid
spores.

In the second stage, the infected cicadas produce a mass of diploid
resting spores, that fall to the ground and wait 17 years for the next
set of victims.
