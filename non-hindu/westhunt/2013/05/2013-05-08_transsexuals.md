Transsexuals

Transsexuals, people that believe their psychological gender conflicts
with their physical gender, are not a particular evolutionary paradox,
because they’re far rarer than homosexual men. One in tens of thousands
of men seek sex reassignment surgery – that is, pay good money to have
someone slice off their willy. At that kind of prevalence, the syndrome
could be explained by mutational pressure or some rare environmental
insult. Maybe they’re from Transylvania.

The question is why anyone – let alone society as a whole – takes the
whole idea seriously – acts as if they are in some sense really women.
There are lots of differences in how the female brain develops and is
wired – castration isn’t going to fix that. You’d need nanosurgery, and
that probably wouldn’t be enough. More like rolling the clock back and
starting over from conception.

Deirdre McCloskey isn’t a woman: wishing can’t make it so, not even
wishing and flashing scalpels. Neither is Joan Roughgarden.

What they are is crazy. Darwinian madness: a behavior pattern that never
works, or more exactly, never worked in past environments. You can make
some sense of psychiatry if you think in terms of Darwinian illness, but
of course psychiatrists haven’t done that and don’t show much interest
in doing so, which is why the DSM is completely incoherent. I mean, they
think homosexuality isn’t a disorder: talk about silly!
