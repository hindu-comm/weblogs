Unprocessed Rice?

Carl Zimmer’s blog
[reports](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/01/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-by-charles-darwin/)
a new paper by some Harvard geneticists proposing that differences in
incidence of diabetes of pregnancy between native New Yorkers and
immigrant Bangladeshi women reflects adaptation to wheat and a high carb
diet in Europeans.

The hypothesis seemed dubious to me, so I wrote to several colleagues
about it. Since I haven’t gotten permission to quote them, I will simply
call them BC (Bangladeshi colleague) and VC (Vanilla colleague). Here is
our correspondence:

BC:

ME:

BC:

VC:

Anyone know about the history or ecology of milling grain?
