Clark/Frost Domestication

Gregory Clark, an economist at UC Davis, posted an essay several years
ago titled *[Genetically
Capitalist?](http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Capitalism%20Genes.pdf)*
in which he proposed that the stable social environment and institutions
of Medieval England selected for a new kind of human who was less prone
to violence, had an affinity for work, had low time preference, and was
individualistic in several ways. This essay was a warmup for his
subsequent
[book](http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Economic-History-Princeton/dp/0691141282).
I prefer the earlier essay and assign it in my courses.

It is easy to see, in retrospect, how the social and institutional
environment selected for the changes that Clark describes. Higher
reproductive fitness of the wealthier led to pervasive downward social
mobility so that today the English are descended from the Medieval
gentry. How did one enter the gentry? Save some money. With interest
rates pushing 10% any savings at all would quickly accumulate. This paid
because there were enforceable contracts, courts, and such mitigating
risk. A ruthless constabulary and judicial system selected against the
violence prone, of course, as well as those with high time preference.
Debtors’ prisons for goodness sake.

Clark’s thesis is no less than that this environment bred a new version
of humans by selection. This is absolutely revolutionary in the current
climate yet it has slipped right past the self-righteous chatterers that
have crucified Jason Richwine.

In an important
[article](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP08376389.pdf) Peter Frost
describes essentially the same process in the Roman Empire with its *Pax
Romana.* Here again a central government with courts and constabulary
shaped a new version of human who was peaceful and law abiding and
worked hard. Frost also describes the reaction of this new version of
human to the Barbarian invasions:

> Nonetheless, when Rome faltered in the fifth century it did so as
> never before. Earlier, the third century had seen a similar crisis:
> civil war, foreign invasion, return of brigandage, and steep economic
> decline. Yet Rome fought its way back and reasserted its authority.
> There was no such response in the fifth century. Instead, the crisis
> was met with a strange mixture of complacency and willful naiveté.
>
> We cannot understand this change without considering the ideology that
> now shaped the Roman worldview, i.e., all humans share the same
> potential for peaceful and submissive behavior. This was largely true
> among the pacified populations inside the empire’s borders. Outside,
> it was largely false. Tragically so.

Thinking about the response of the pacified and submission Roman
population to barbarian invaders immediately brings to mind the response
of contemporary North Americans and Atlantic Europeans to barbarian
invaders. It reads just the same: “welcome new neighbor!”

What about the Eastern empire? They kept the barbarians out for a few
centuries longer in the European half, but accounts of the loss of the
Asian provinces show the Clark/Frost pattern, a pacified submissive
population hardly contesting the invasion of Islam (Jenkins 2008, 2010).
The new neighbors simply walked in and took over. The downfall of the
Western Roman empire reads much like the downfall of the Asian and North
African parts of the empire. It is certainly no accident that the Asian
provinces were the heartland of Christianity.

This all brings up an interesting question: what happened in East Asia
over the same period? No one to my knowledge has traced parallels with
the European and Roman experience in Japan or China. Is the different
East Asian trajectory related to the East Asian reluctance to roll over,
wag their tails, and welcome new barbarian neighbors?
