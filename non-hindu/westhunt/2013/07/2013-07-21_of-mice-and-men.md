Of Mice and Men

It’s not always easy figuring out how a pathogen causes disease. There
is an example in mice for which the solution was very difficult, so
difficult that we would probably have failed to discover the cause of a
similarly obscure infectious disease in humans.

*Mycoplasma pulmonis* causes a chronic obstructive lung disease in mice,
but it wasn’t easy to show this. The disease was first described in
1915, and by 1940, people began to suspect *Mycoplasma pulmonis* might
be the cause. But then again, maybe not. It was often found in mice
that seemed healthy. Pure cultures of this organism did not consistently
produce lung disease – which means that it didn’t satisfy Koch’s
postulates, in particular postulate 1 (The microorganism must be found
in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not
be found in healthy organisms.) and postulate 3 (The cultured
microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy
organism.).

Well, those postulates are not logic itself, but rather a useful
heuristic. Koch knew that, even if lots of other people don’t.

This respiratory disease of mice is long-lasting, but slow to begin. It
can take half a lifetime – a mouse lifetime, that is – and that made
finding the cause harder. It required patience, which means I certainly
couldn’t have done it.

Here’s how they solved it. You can raise germ-free mice. In the early
1970s, researchers injected various candidate pathogens into different
groups of germ-free mice and waited to see which, if any, developed
this chronic lung disease. It was *Mycoplasma* *pulmonis* , all right,
but it had taken 60 years to find out.

It turned out that susceptibility differed between different mouse
strains – genetic susceptibility was important. Co-infection with other
pathogens affected the course of the disease. Microenvironmental
details mattered – mainly ammonia in cages where the bedding wasn’t
changed often enough. But it didn’t happen without that mycoplasma,
which was a key causal link, something every engineer understands but
many MDs don’t.

If there was a similarly obscure infectious disease of humans, say one
that involved a fairly common bug found in both the just and the unjust,
one that took decades for symptoms to manifest – would we have solved
it? Probably not.

Cooties are everywhere.
