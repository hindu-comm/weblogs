Legionnaire’s disease

Before 1900, armies usually lost more men from infectious disease than
combat, particularly in extended campaigns. At least that seems to have
been the case in modern Western history.

There are indications that infectious disease was qualitatively
different – less important – in the Roman legions. For one thing,
camps were placed near good supplies of fresh water. The legions had
good camp sanitation, at least by the time of the Principate. They used
latrines flushed with running water in permanent camps and deep slit
trenches with wooden covers and removable buckets in the field. Using
those latrines would have protected soldiers from diseases like typhoid
and dysentery, major killers in recent armies. Romans armies were
mobile, often shifting their camps. They seldom quartered their
soldiers in urban areas – they feared that city luxuries would corrupt
their men, but this habit helped them avoid infectious agents,
regardless of their reasons.

They managed to avoid a lot of serious illnesses because the causative
organisms simply weren’t there yet. Smallpox, and maybe measles, didn’t
show up until the middle Empire. Falciparum malaria was around, but
hadn’t reached Rome itself, during the Republic. It definitely had by
the time of the Empire. Bubonic plague doesn’t seem to have caused
trouble before Justinian. Syphilis for sure, and typhus probably,
originated in the Americas, while cholera didn’t arrive until after
1800.
