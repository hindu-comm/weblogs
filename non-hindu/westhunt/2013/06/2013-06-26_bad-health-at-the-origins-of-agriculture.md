Bad Health at the Origins of Agriculture



### Bad Health and Agricultural Origins

A few weeks ago on Jason Collins’s *Evolving Economics* blog there was a
[discussion](http://www.jasoncollins.org/2013/06/height-through-the-millennia)
of changes in human height assessed from skeletal remains. A well-known
finding is that when humans started farming they became shorter, less
robust, and exhibited numerous pathologies. The new foods were
apparently not so good for us.

This decline in size and indicators of health occurred in the New World,
in Europe, and in East Asia. While much of the literature is focussed
simply on documenting this remarkable change in our biology, it seems to
me that there are very interesting issues that ought to be examined more
carefully. The conventional story is that shared nutritional
deficiencies are responsible for the health decline, but recent popular
nutrition literature seems to emphasize the toxicity of many of the new
foods, particularly grasses. For an excellent scholarly summary see the
excellent book by the Jaminets \[1\].

Did we adapt to the new diet over several millenia? If the culprits were
simply carbohydrates it might be more difficult that coming up with
simple solutions to simple toxins.

One of the go-to guys these days on human paleopathology is [Clark
Larsen](anthropology.osu.edu/faculty/pages/larsen.php) at Ohio State
University. I wrote him to ask about the current state of knowledge,
and, with his permission, here is his summary:

-   All are deficient in one or more essential amino acids (lysine for
    maize, millet, and wheat);
-   None of the common domesticated cereals have adequate bioavailable
    iron;
-   All are deficient in one or more vitamins: e.g., B1 (thiamine), B2
    (riboflavin), C (ascorbic acid);
-   All have links with malnutrition, immunosuppression, and
    susceptibility to a variety of pathogens rendering the individual
    prone to infection where the population derives the majority of
    calories/energy from plant domesticates;
-   All are carbohydrates, creating circumstances that promote a
    cariogenic oral environment and dental caries, oral infection, and
    susceptibility to degenerative conditions in later life (e.g.,
    cardiovascular disease, diabetes).

Clark suggested several reviews he has written recently \[2,3\] as well
as the classic volume edited by Cohen and Armelagos\[4\].

In the Collins blog post cited above there is reported work by [Tim
Gage](http://www.albany.edu/anthro/gage.php) showing that there is
recovery from the new diet. It is not clear from post who cited this,
but at any rate Tim denies having written anything at all about health
and the agricultural transition.

If the culprits on the different continents were simply cooked
carbohydrates then we do expect roughly the same outcome everywhere, and
Larsen suggests that this is so. On the other hand one notices hints of
greater complexity in the literature. Caries and gum disease are
prominent in North American collections and much less common in Europe.
One anomalous European site shows a lot of caries, and the authors
suggest that they must have had a lot of honey in their diet.

An easy test for region-specific adaptations comes to mind. New foods,
especially cereals, introduced by the Atlantic Exchange after 1492
should have been difficult for the recipients, who were not adapted to
plants from the other side of the ocean. I do not recall ever having
seen a discussion of this, and it might make an interesting project.
Maize spread rapidly in southern Europe and in Africa: did it cause
trouble early on? Is it still causing trouble? The staple of the diet in
much of southern Africa today is ground maize (“mealie meal”) but no one
seems concerned. While maize is associated with iron deficiency in many
places, iron overload is a health problem in Africa, perhaps from the
widespread use of cast iron pots.
