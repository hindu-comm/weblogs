True Names

Now that Willerslev’s article is out in Nature, there are a number of
pieces discussing about it. The gist is that there was a population
that ranged from France deep into Siberia, one that accounts for part of
the ancestry of Europeans (especially to the north and east) and also
part of the ancestry of Amerindians. I’ve talked about this
[earlier](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/?s=first+of+the+mohicans).

The way in which this seems to have happened in Europe is rather
interesting: first you have the old Mesolithic hunters. They are then
largely replaced by farmers from the Levant, some settling the southern
coast of Europe and others moving up along the Danube – genetically
similar to modern Sardinians. A new wave \[Indo-Europeans, surely\]
mostly replaces those farmers, and this new wave has a fair amount of
ancestry from a group very similar to those original Mesolithic
hunters. So the amount of Mesolithic hunter ancestry among Europeans
first goes way down and then goes up again. The return of the native
strikes back.

Those Mesolithic hunter-gatherers aren’t exactly a lost race, since they
had plenty of descendants, but it seems that there are no longer any
unmixed examples – although we really need to check out the Lapps.

The problem is, they need a name. “Ancestral North Eurasians” just
doesn’t sing. Neither does “Ancient Siberians”. Personally, I like
“Hyperboreans”. Ginny likes “Sibermen”.
