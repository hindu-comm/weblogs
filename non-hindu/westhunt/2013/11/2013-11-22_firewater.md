Firewater

In every population, some people have serious problems with alcohol, but
this happens more in some populations than others. In particular,
populations with low or nonexistent historical exposure to alcohol have
higher rates of alcoholism. Hunter-gatherers all seem to have serious
problems with alcohol. The Hadza, Bushmen, Pygmies, Australian
Aboriginals, Andaman islanders, and Eskimos all have a high percentage
of lushes.

Now this all makes sense: alcoholic beverages are mostly made from
domesticated plants, and hunter-gatherers didn’t have much exposure to
them. Alcoholism has high heritability, and it’s bad for you: you’d
expect it to decline over time, be less common in populations that have
been drinking for a long time, all else equal. In East Asia, many
people have a bunged-up version of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the
enzyme that converts acetaldehyde into acetate (after alcohol has been
converted into acetaldehyde). This makes drinking so uncomfortable that
carriers are highly resistant to alcoholism. They don’t need to buy
Antabuse – the effect is built-in.

This Chinese mutation was definitely selected, maybe for protection
against alcoholism, but possibly for some other reason.

So in China a lot of the story is in one gene, but in other populations,
resistance to alcoholism is polygenic.

All this is fairly obvious, but my impression is that cultural
anthropologists, and for that matter right-thinking people generally,
don’t think that genetics has anything to do with different rates of
alcoholism in different populations. Probably libertarians don’t think
it does either, although they undoubtedly have *different* wrong ideas
about this.
