Their Lying Eyes

Once upon a time, I read a book on parasitology. In the the
introduction, the author mentioned a copepod that settles on the eyes of
a particular kind of fish, eventually leaving that fish blind. He
mentioned that naive grad students would often assume that this was bad
for the fish, lowered its fitness – but of course a sophisticate like
himself understood that parasites always evolved to become harmless to
the host, so in fact that induced blindness didn’t decrease the fish’s
fitness at all.

I could explain how a better evolutionary analysis can indeed explain
nonzero virulence, but that is not the real question. The real question
is, what should we do with pinheads like this? There are whole fields
in which the average professor is that loony. Come the Revolution,
what should be done?
