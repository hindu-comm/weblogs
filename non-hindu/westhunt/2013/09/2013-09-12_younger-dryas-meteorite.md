Younger Dryas Meteorite

It has been suggested that a large meteorite was responsible for an odd
climatic twitch from about 12,800 to 11,500 years ago (the Younger Dryas
, a temporary return to glacial conditions in the Northern Hemisphere)
and for the extinction of the large mammals of North America. They
hypothesize air bursts or impact of a swarm of meteors , centered around
the Great Lakes. Probably this is all nonsense.

The topic of the Holocene extinction of megafauna seems to bring out the
crazy in people. In my opinion, the people supporting this Younger Dryas
impact hypothesis are nuts, and half of their opponents are nuts as
well.

Let’s just think about this hypothesis as an explanation of megafaunal
extinction. There certainly was such an extinction: North America had
mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths, giant turtles, glyptodonts,
giant armadillos, short-faced bears, sabertooths, something similar to
the African lion (Felis Atrox), etc. No longer, which is just as well.

The problem for that meteorite explanation of North Ammerican megafaunal
extinction is that South America had an even more varied set of
megafauna (gomphotheriums, toxodonts, macrauchenia, glyptodonts, giant
sloths, etc) and they went extinct around the same time (probably a few
hundred years later). There’s no way for a hit around the Great Lakes
to wipe out stuff in Patagonia, barring a huge, dinosaur-killer type hit
that throws tremendous amount of debris into suborbital trajectories.
But that would have hit the entire world… Didn’t happen.
