Open niches

When I first learned that mitochondria (and chloroplasts) have their
own DNA and their own personal DNA replication mechanism, I wondered if
they had their own viruses that hijacked that replication mechanism.
It was a long time coming, but it seems that there are indeed viruses
that infect the mitochondria of some fungi. Obviously, this kind of
thing is particularly likely in fungi.

Since living cells are exchanged between mother and unborn children,
and persist for decades, there is a possible niche for cells that are
transmitted from mother to daughter, and on to granddaughters after
that, and so on. Probably to sons as well, but they would most likely
be dead ends. It is easy to show that a maternally transmitted host
cell line would have to have effects on fitness that are no worse than
neutral – in practice, beneficial.

So humans could well carry a maternally transmitted symbiote that was
originally human – something like canine venereal sarcoma.

This ought to be true of mammals generally, and even if we don’t have
one, some other mammalian species might.
