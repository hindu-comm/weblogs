Nasty, brutish, but not that short

Average life span is pretty short for contemporary foragers (30-35
years). For that matter, it was short for agricultural peoples until
fairly recently. Most people probably don’t know this. Most of the
people who do know fundamentally misunderstand it. Today most people die
when they’re old, moderately close to the average age of death. Back in
the day, a very large fraction died when young, due to infectious
disease and food shortages. And subincision. Most people who know about
those short lifespans in the past somehow can’t really believe that
infant mortality accounts for most of the difference. If the average
lifespan was 30, they figure that hardly anyone made it to 40. I’ve had
a doctor explain to me that that hardly anyone lived to be 70 in *1900
in the US* (!).

We know that this is not the case in contemporary hunter-gatherers. If
you make it to 15, you have a pretty good chance of making it to 60.
Life expectancy at 15 was about 48 among the Australian Aborigines and
51 for the !Kung Bushmen. In some other groups, expected lifetime at 15
was lower, in the 30s. Still – even so lots of people made it to 60 or
later.

A high average paternal age was only possible if quite a few guys lived
well over 50 – but that happened.
