The Mamas and the Papas

A new paper in Science (Brandt et al) talks about genetic changes in
European prehistory, mainly by looking at mitochondrial DNA. They do
this because mtDNA is easier to recover and sequence than Y-chromosome
or autosomal DNA. The most complete story must, however, lie in the
autosomal data.

Generally speaking, conquerors seem more likely to incorporate women
into their society than men, so the story you get from looking at mtDNA
is not going to be the same as that deduced from Y-chromosomes. If it
looks as if early farmers from the Impressed Ware and Cardial cultures
account for \~30% of European DNA today – judging from mtDNA – the
autosomal fraction is likely to be significantly lower than that. The
same is probably true for Mesolithic DNA in Europeans – ancestry
estimates based on mtDNA are likely to be on the high side.
