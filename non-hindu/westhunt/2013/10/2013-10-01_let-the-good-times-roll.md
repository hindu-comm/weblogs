Let the good times roll?

A new
[paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003815)
in PLOS Genetics claims to have found a higher frequency of deleterious
mutations in the exome of French Canadians than in the French. French
Canada was founded by a small population (effective Ne about 2900), but
I think that bottleneck has little to do with this increased load. If
this result is correct, I see only two possibilities: either the
original settlers already had higher-than-average load, or they were
subject to relaxed purifying selection.

We all know that purifying selection is considerably weaker nowadays in
the decent parts of the world, what with chlorinated water and doctors
that cure more often than they kill. But when you think about it, some
recent fast-expanding settler populations must also have been subject to
weaker than typical purifying selection, just because they had plenty to
eat and relatively low disease incidence. In premodern Europe, maybe
half of the kids lived to grow up, and the numbers for hunter-gatherers
are in the same ball park. But in colonial New England, it was more
like 90%, and I would guess that the numbers were similar in Quebec.
Cold weather helped. Selection wasn’t as relaxed as it is today, but
survival was a lot easier than it had been in typically Malthusian human
societies – and in some cases, the process went on longer than modern
medicine has existed (only 3 or 4 generations). It’s not high paternal
age: that was Euro-typical, around 34.

The Frogs have had it rougher than the Canucks.
