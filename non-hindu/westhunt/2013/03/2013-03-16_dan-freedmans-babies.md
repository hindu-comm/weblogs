Dan Freedman’s babies

Daniel Freedman was a professor of anthropology at the University of
Chicago. For his doctoral thesis, he did adoption studies with dogs.
He had noticed that different dog breeds had different personalities,
and thought it would be interesting to see if personality was inborn, or
if it was somehow caused by the way in which the mother raised her
puppies. Totally inborn. Little beagles were irrepressibly friendly.
Shetland sheepdogs were most sensitive to a loud voice or the slightest
punishment. Wire-haired terriers were so tough and aggressive that Dan
had to wear gloves when playing with puppies that were only three weeks
old. Basenjis were aloof and independent.

He decided to try the same thing with human infants of different
breeds. Excuse me, different races. He looked at newborn babies in a
hospital in San Francisco where his first child had been born. He
compared Cantonese babies with babies of Northern European origin. The
division of sexes was the same, the mothers were the same age, they had
about the same number of previous children, and they had been
administered the same drugs in the same amounts during labor.

White babies started to cry more easily, and once they started, they
were more difficult to console. Chinese babies adapted to almost any
position in which they were placed; for example, when placed face down
in their cribs, they tended to keep their faces buried in the sheets
rather than immediately turning to one side, as the Caucasian babies
did. They briefly pressed the baby’s nose with a cloth, forcing him to
breath with his mouth. Most white (and black) babies fight this maneuver
by immediately turning away or swiping at the cloth with their hands,
and this is reported in Western pediatric textbooks as normal. While the
average Chinese baby would simply lay on his back, breathing through the
mouth, accepting the cloth without a fight. There are movies of this:
they are apparently quite striking, and should be on YouTube. I talked
to a prof who showed these movies to students in a class at an Ivy
league university: they really, really hated it. They should emigrate
to a different reality – one of those probability lines outside the
Blight, full of butt-kicking pixies, avuncular gay men, Melanesian
super-hackers, and female Fields medalists. And unicorns.

Later, he looked at Navaho babies: they’re like Chinese, only more so.

Japanese babies are like Chinese, but less so: more irritable, but not
as irritable as white kids.
