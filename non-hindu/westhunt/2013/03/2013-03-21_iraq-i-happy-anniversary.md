Iraq I – Happy Anniversary !

This is an email I sent to a friend back on 10/14/2002. He was arguing
that Saddam was close to having the Bomb and would then make Iraq a
terrorist base – so we should invade.

Madness of Crowds:

Come on, you take that seriously? By that argument China is harboring
anti-American terrorists right now. This is all horseshit. As far as
I can tell, exactly nothing new has happened in Iraq concerning nukes.
Most likely they are getting steadily farther away from having a nuclear
weapon.. Look, back in 1990, they surprised people with their
calutrons. No normal country would have made such an effort, because
calutrons – mass spectrometers – are an incredibly inefficient way of
making a nuclear weapon. We know just how inefficient they are, because
E. O Lawrence conned the government into blowing about a quarter of the
Manhattan Project budget on a similar effort.Concentrating enough
U-235 for one small fission bomb cost hundreds of millions of 1944
dollars. Probably the Japanese could have constructed new cities for
less money thanthis approach took to blow them up. By far the cheaper
way is to enrich the uranium just enough to run a reactor and then breed
plutonium. The Iraqis wanted U-235, probably because it is much easier
to make a device with U-235 than with plutonium. You don’t have to use
implosion and you don’t even have to test a gun-type bomb – we didn’t
test the Hiroshima bomb. . I would guess that they realized their
limitations – they’re not exactly overflowing with good physicists and
engineers – and chose an approach that they could actually have made
work. Implosion is not so easy to make work. India only got their
implosion bomb to work on the seventh try, back in 1974, and they have a
\_hell\_ of a lot more technical talent than Iraq.

Anyhow, Iraq doesn’t have the money to do it anymore (1). The total
money going into his government is what, a fifth of what it used to be?
(Jeez, quite a bit less than that, when you look carefully) Big
non-private organizations tend to gradually slide towards zero output
when the money merely stays the same: cutand they fire the worker bees
and keep a few Powerpoint specialists. There is no reason to think
that Arabs areimmune to that kind of logic of bureaucracy. On the
contrary. Not only are they not making any nuclear progress, they’re
probably making regress.

At best, if we hadn’t interrupted them back in the Gulf War, they would
have eventually had a couple. I doubt if it they even would have been
an effective deterrent.It’s hard to make classic deterrence work when
you have one or two bombs and the other guy has thousands, when he can
hit you and you can’t hit him.

He would cause himself practical trouble by harboring anti-US
terrorists. If they ever made a significant hit on the US, he’d be in
deep shit. What would he get out of it? And I am supposed to think
that he fears terrorist groups more than he fears a Trident boat?? He
should appease \_them\_, rather than us? Look, if we really got mad,
we could turn him and his entire nation into something that was no
longer human. Kill them too, of course, but that’s too easy.

This particular argument isnonsense, even if he had a little deterrent.
as are all the ones that I have seen floated by the Administration or
by their hangers on and flacks. It’s not as crazy as the idea that
we’re going to democratize Iraq, or Iraq and then the entire Arab world
– that’s about as crazy as a human can get – but it makes no sense.
Anyone with a brain knows, for example, that the last thing Israel wants
is democratic Arab states, because they”d be \_more\_ hostile than the
existing governments, and possibly stronger. . People like Mubarak
understand that they can’t beat the IDF, and also understand who makes
the deposits in their Swiss accounts: a new popular government might
not. And a popular government might have some enthusiasm to draw on –
Iran did, at first, after the fall of the Shah – whereas in places like
Syria or Iraq \> 70% of the population hates the government.

I know why Wolfowitz wants this, and why Bill Kristol wants this. I
know that most Americans have decided that Iraq was somehow responsible
for 9-11, because what else would explain the Administration’s desire
to attack? And so they support an attack, which would make every kind
of sense if Iraq \_had\_ been behind 9-11  Except that everyone knows
that they didn’t have anything to do with it.  The problem is, I don’t
understand, even slightly, why Bush and Cheney want this.

\(1\)  Almost all the oil sales (other than truck smuggling) go
through the UN. 68% of that revenue is available for buying
\_approved\_ imports. Mainly food and other things that we approve
of. The US has a veto on such purchases. The total amount available
for those approved purchases was something like 7 billion last year.
Saddam is getting under-the-table payments of something like 20 cents a
barrel from some or for all I know all of the buyers: but how much cash
is that? we’re talking something like 1 or 2 % – no more than 100
million a year. Sheesh. Probably the truck smuggling accounts for
more. Hmm.. That might be as much as a billion. Not much cash to run a
government. . It’s a little hard to for me to see how he manages to
keep the show on the road at all.
