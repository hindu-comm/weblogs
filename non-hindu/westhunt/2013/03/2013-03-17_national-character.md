National Character

Dan Freedman’s work makes it clear that there are hard-wired
differences in personality between different human populations. On
average, but quite noticeable. Not just between groups that are
separated by long distances or ancient population splits: there are
noticeable differences between Cantonese and Japanese, or between
Chinese and Navaho. Not all such differences will show up in the first
day of life, but it is easy to see that first-day behaviors are innate.
Later behaviors may or may not be.

The standard belief in the academy is that there are no such personality
differences between ethnic groups and races. It’s not that they have
some kind of argument based on genetics and selection and prehistory
that makes such differences super-unlikely: no, it can’t be true because
it would hurt their feelings.

You know, the people populating the social sciences are bound to be
right about something, eventually.
