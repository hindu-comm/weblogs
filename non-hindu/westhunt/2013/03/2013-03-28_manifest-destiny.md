Manifest Destiny

[![DSCN3581](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dscn3581.jpg?w=640&h=480)](https://westhunt.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dscn3581.jpg)

Once upon a time, before we all realized that the United State’s true
purpose was rocking the casbah – as long as grass grows or waters flow
– some of us had other goals in mind.

I sold one of these T-shirts to Larry Niven, and it showed up in one of
his books, as one his protagonists was packing for impromptu astronaut
training:

“A T-shirt faded almost to gray, but he recognized the print on the
chest: an American flag with a whirlpool galaxy in the upper left
corner. A hundred billion stars…”

I still have a few, and if y’aal are really interested, I could make
more.
