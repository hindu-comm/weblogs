In the first place

We hear a lot about innovative educational approaches, and since these
silly people have been at this for a long time now, we hear just as
often about the innovative approaches that some idiot started up a few
years ago and are now crashing in flames. We’re in steady-state.

I’m wondering if it isn’t time to try something archaic. In particular,
mnemonic techniques, such as the [method of
loci.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) As far as I know,
nobody has actually tried integrating the more sophisticated mnemonic
techniques into a curriculum. Sure, we all know useful acronyms, like
the one for resistor color codes, but I’ve not heard of anyone teaching
kids how to build a memory palace.

I’m just suggesting taking the idea out for a spin, see if it works well
in some small, statistically-careful trials. I’m not talking about
foisting it on everyone nationwide, willy-nilly. Which shows just how
out of it I am.
