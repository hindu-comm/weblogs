Wild Produce from The Wildside

Wild coffee jam

We have been making jams, pickles, sauerkrauts, herbal teas, juices and preserves from the wild food growing around us for a while now. Most of it we consume ourselves – a jar of mango jam lasts about five minutes when there’s ten of us and a freshly baked loaf of sourdough – and what little remains becomes Diwali and Christmas presents.

This year we thought we’d try selling our produce very informally among friends and family to help with the upkeep of the place now that we are both officially unemployed. To this end we plan to start a WhatsApp group which anyone who is interested in buying Wildside produce can join by clicking [here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EqwVmDAb6WH3EDWuWwOQe0).

This is the line up to start with:

Wild mangosteen jam from two enormous trees in the jungle behind us

Jams and jellies made from our wild-grown\* coffee cherries and flavoured with the riverside rose petals (you have probably never eaten the fruit of the coffee plant; it is sweet and delicious and also boosts brain power – see the post I wrote on it recently [here](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2020/01/30/cherry-picking-2/))

Wild-grown\* Arabica coffee beans

Wild-grown\* black peppercorns

We will probably plan an informal meet up one weekend in Cubbon Park where anyone who wants to buy some produce can do so. More details will be sent on the WhatsApp group.

\* The coffee and pepper were planted but have been completely free of any fertilizer or pesticide, organic or inorganic, since 2015 when we bought this land. And over the last couple of years we have stopped all maintenance (eg: trimming the coffee plants, tying up the pepper and keeping the jungle at bay). The only thing we do is harvest maybe half of the total fruit; because that’s all we can access, the rest is too overgrown. Our output has naturally fallen dramatically but as recompense elephants make our thickly forested plantation their home; all manner of wild edibles are growing below, above, around and on the coffee and pepper; and the soil, covered in several years of leaf fall, is slowly growing richer. Hence ‘wild-grown’.
