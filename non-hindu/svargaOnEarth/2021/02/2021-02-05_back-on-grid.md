Back on Grid

I can understand the lure of going off grid in countries like England.Quite apart from the ideological incentives, being connected to the grid is incredibly expensive.The bills for electricity, natural gas (used for heating and cooking in houses that are connected to the gas pipeline), heating oil and mains water and sewage can be astronomical, and that’s before you’ve paid council tax.

Here is a rough idea of energy and water usage in our four bedroom cottage, with the four of us plus a lodger:

- Electricity: about 8,000 kwh at £1,400 p/a - Oil: about 3,000 litres at £1,000 p/a - Water (including mains sewage): about 168,000 litres at £780 p/a

Total: £3,180, almost ten times our total annual utility spend in our three bedroom flat in Bangalore

With sky-high bills and a guilty conscience every time the boiler comes on to burn yet more oil, I have been investigating how to tackle our use of these resources.It seems to me there are two main ways to reduce energy and water consumption: the first is to change your lifestyle so that your actual consumption reduces; the second is to technologise your way out of trouble while continuing to live life with all mod cons.

Revert and Reduce

The first approach often involves reverting to traditional ways of life and paying in sweat rather than money for the energy we use.Actual resource consumption tends to fall dramatically.If you have to work to get each drop of water you use it is precious and you naturally never waste it.\*This is the approach we took, more by accident than design, in Sakleshpur.We spent months each year collecting, processing and stacking firewood for cooking and for heating water in the bathrooms, and then kindled and lit the wood stove every time we wanted to cook (we soon realised it was easier to cook twice a day rather than three times).Baking in our cob oven required a whole day, starting with splitting the wood into small enough pieces, and ending with a grand succession of dishes through the oven: pizza, bread, cake, biscuits, roasted vegetables, peanuts and then a huge Pongal to slow-cook overnight. It was hard work and needed many hands, but good fun, so we did it on the weekend when friends were staying and turned it into a party.We ferried water back and forth with the use of non-automated piping systems and good old-fashioned buckets. Our compost loos worked brilliantly but they were basic, and needed to be emptied every six months.We never had electrical appliances such as fridge, washing machine and kitchen necessities (kettle and toaster in England; mixey in India) because we had no means of powering them.We soon realised life was totally possible, albeit certainly less convenient, without them.Lights, powered by tiny solar panels from good old Amazon, only came on at dusk, and phones were used sparingly because it was slow to charge them on the solar light batteries.Laptops rarely surfaced, and there was virtually no internet access, which freed up vast amounts of time.

In England, there are two issues with this back-to-the-basics approach.First is that it is cold here.Not Canada cold or Russia cold, but cold enough and wet enough that hot, or at least warm, water is needed for washing clothes and dishes as well as for showers, warmth is needed to dry wet laundry, and in almost all houses some amount of heating is needed for at least four months of the year.Providing for all these needs requires an enormous amount more work and energy than off-grid life in sunny southern India.Not that there are not people doing it in communities across the country.And of course in the past there was no other option.

The second problem is that in this country things are ridiculously over-regulated.When our electric hob and oven packed up the other day, Uppu suggested we put in a wood-fired stove like in Sakleshpur.That’s not as far-fetched as it sounds.Our 19^(th)century cottage has a chimney in the kitchen where the hearth would have been. My parents’ house, built in 1692, has a traditional bread oven, not dissimilar to the one we made in Sakleshpur.But things are very different now, and wood fires are currently so frowned upon that even our smokeless wood-burning stove in the sitting room may soon be deemed unacceptable.You can’t even divert your kitchen grey water to the garden without running afoul of the rules.If you want to go off grid without investing vast amounts of money and time on compliance your best bet is to find a remote, preferably invisible, spot, do what you want and hope nobody ever reports you to the council.

Innovate and Hope (for the best)

The second approach to reducing energy consumption is to move in the other direction: onwards and upwards.You use evolving technologies to make your energy consumption more efficient and more sustainable.This is the approach that many off-gridders are in fact taking.They want to retain their washing machine and fridge, but run it off the renewable energy created by the sun.They still want power showers, but create a sophisticated rainwater harvesting mechanism with solar-powered pump to make it work.And their loos are composting but look like regular toilets, are powered by electricity and require no maintenance.Consumption remains the same, but the means of meeting that consumption change to become more sustainable.

This is also the approach that the British government seems to favour.It has all manner of schemes to encourage householders to switch to renewable energy sources.For instance, we can now replace our oil boiler with an air source heat pump, which is powered by electricity but uses no fuel, and the government will pay up to £5,000 towards the installation and then pay us back a certain amount over the next seven years.There have been similar schemes to incentivise solar panels and other renewable energy sources at the domestic level.

While there is definitely growing awareness that resources are not to be wasted – utility boards are always telling us to switch off taps and lights – no one is seriously suggesting that we re-think whether we actually need central heating; electrical appliances to meet every possible need, from ice cream making to automated grass cutting; and hot and cold water on tap throughout the house.In a couple of generations, people have become habituated to the freedom from domestic chores that devices such as a washing machine bring. They have got used to central heating, to their houses being warm enough in winter that you barely need more than a t shirt when inside.Who would ever countenance a return to the old, cold days where you put on an extra jumper, or three, when the temperature dropped?

What is encouraging is that renewable energy here is well advanced.For instance, it is now possible to opt for an electricity supplier that generates 100% of their supply from renewable sources.So while I am still reeling from the fact that we consume 8,000 kwh of electricity a year, at least I know it’s not coming from burning coal.

On a global scale, though, can this second approach reduce energy consumption enough, especially when you consider that large parts of the world’s billions don’t yet have all these energy-guzzling mod cons?Can technology enable us to hang onto our dishwashers and tumble dryers, to continue to heat or cool our homes to the most comfortable temperature, without destroying the planet?Who knows, but for our part we will most probably follow the path of least resistance while living here and see where technology takes us.At the very least it should be able to soothe our guilty consciences.

\*At the community of Sadhana Forest in Pondicherry, volunteers must go to the communal kitchen and use the hand pump there to fill a bucket of water every time they shower.New arrivals tend to fill their bucket full, but by their second shower they have learnt that lugging a full bucket of water all the way back isn’t worth that extra few litres so almost everyone manages with half a bucket.
