Covid Strategies

Two news articles in the British press about Covid in India gave me the courage to write about some reasonably controversial ideas we have long been discussing.

The [first](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-54730290), which appeared on the BBC website in November, explored the paradoxical fact that India, where conditions couldn’t be more ripe for the devastating spread of a virus such as Covid, seemed to have got off lightly.Case fatality rates, even when you discount for the under-reporting, are just 2%.The journalist, Soutik Biswas, links this, albeit rather cautiously, to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’: the idea that our over-sanitised environments are weakening our immune systems, whereas in India “low hygiene, lack of clean drinking water, and unsanitary conditions may have actually saved many lives from severe Covid-19”.

The headline of the [second,](https://www.ft.com/content/07988f31-d511-4af4-8b78-03ecaf2d4df7) published in the Financial Times last weekend, ran: ‘Has the pandemic burnt itself out in India?’Although the sources quoted in the article were still cautious about a second wave, most agree that with India’s caseload dropping from around 100,000 a day in September to about 13,000 by the end of January, it looks like India is over Covid.A virologist from Tamil Nadu is quoted: “What we seem to have done is let the virus run its course…the epidemic seems to be naturally coming down.” And this is, the experts feel, due not to the vaccination drive, which has only just started, but rather to herd immunity.

This raises a few questions about the fight against Covid and future pandemic threats.

**First, is this the right way to fight it?**

The strategy most governments have adopted consists of the holy trinity of hand sanitiser, face masks and severe limitations on social interaction and travel.This ensures that each citizen is shielded within a germ-proof bubble through which neither Covid, nor indeed any other bug, can penetrate.It’s a foolproof strategy were it not that the technically perfect bubble is undermined by human failings.We forget to wash our hands, we get fed up of wearing our mask, and we want to go see our elderly, lonely parents.So rates fall dramatically when governments lock their populations down and mandate masks and hand washing, but Covid doesn’t disappear.

Officially India was following the same policy.There was one massive and extremely draconian (friends told us they couldn’t leave their flats because lathi-wielding police were patrolling the common areas of the apartment complex) national lockdown, back in March.For the last few months though it seems to have been business as usual.People can travel, shop, socialise, celebrate festivals and weddings, and go to work, and all in the vast numbers that are the norm in India.They can’t go to school, quite inexplicably, but even that looks set to open up again soon.Masks are mandatory but as with everything in India the gap between rule and compliance is large.And if you do need to show a negative Covid test, you can always buy one.As a result of this and the realities of hugger-mugger life on the sub-continent, a huge amount of people have been exposed to the virus, leading ultimately to a certain degree of herd immunity.

Now of course what works in a young, tropical country may well not work in an elderly, temperate country; only 6.5% of India is over 65 compared to 20% in Europe.But still it makes you think.The loss of so many civil liberties and freedoms, the loneliness and the isolation, the boredom and the depression, the home-working and homeschooling, the financial ruin, the unemployment – we need to know that it’s all worth it, that it is entirely unavoidable, that the only way to defeat Covid is to beat it into submission.

If it’s not, then we need to urgently consider other strategies.Rather than trying to ensure no one ever comes into contact with the disease, could a more nuanced approach work? Shield and protect those with compromised immune systems, and help the young and healthy to develop the strong immune systems needed to counter the virus while allowing them to return, at least partially, to pre-Covid life.

**Secondly, what are the long-term implications for our immunological health?**

One of the things that makes Indians more tolerant of Covid is their strong immune systems.India is rich in all manner of pathogens, from exotic tropical viruses to the most humble of stomach bugs.And those pathogens are kept in constant circulation thanks to population density and living conditions. While many succumb, those who survive grow strong.

This concept appears in different forms in many medical and research contexts.In essence the immune system is designed to develop effectively by being exposed to manageable amounts of pathogens through infancy and childhood.Children who grow up in over-sanitised environments often develop allergies and auto-immune disorders such as asthma, eczema, hayfever and diabetes, because their immune systems haven’t had a chance to be challenged and develop as they should.The BBC article quotes Matt Ritchell, who has written a book on the subject, “The broad idea is that we are starving our immune systems of training and activity by excessive focus on cleanliness.”

Obviously the huge leaps in hygiene and sanitation that the world has seen in the last century or two have massively lowered the burden of disease; no one is suggesting India should stop the fight for clean drinking water and clean(er) living conditions.But perhaps in countries like England we’ve gone a little too far in the other direction.

Our new Covid world is not just sanitised, it’s sterilised.In shielding ourselves from Covid, we are also shielding ourselves from every other foreign particle, good and bad.Will this in time mean our immune systems grow weak from lack of use?What of lockdown babies, never held by friends and relatives, never taken to mother-baby classes, never going to the supermarket or travelling on a bus – in short never exposed to the normal bugs in their environment?What of children growing up without the mud, blood, sweat and tears of playground games, washing their hands every 20 minutes, subconsciously learning to fear human contact from the socially distancing adults around them?

So long as the shield is in place, we’re more or less ok.But how can we ever emerge from behind the shield if our natural defences are insufficient, either undeveloped or atrophied?How can we resume our old carefree lives, with unmasked faces and unwashed hands?

Now most of you at this point will say the solution lies in the jab.Which leads me to my****final question,**are vaccines the answer?**

Not being impartial on this matter, nor wishing to risk heresy in the current climate of vaccine-love, I’d better not answer this one but instead leave you with this excerpt from Robert Shrimsley’s always amusing and spot-on column in the FT magazine this week:

“You don’t hear so many people talking about Big Pharma these days.The pandemic has left most sane people rather in love with pharma; the bigger the better as far as we are concerned.Frankly, there is no deal we would not wave through for an extra few million Covid-19 vaccines.And even when this pandemic is pushed back, we will all be gearing up for the next one or, hopefully, focusing on the more global concern of antibiotic or antimicrobial concern.The only objection to Big Pharma will be that it isn’t Huge Pharma.”

I can only conclude I’m no longer counted among the sane.
