Got To Keep Moving

[As promised](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2021/08/06/grow-wild/) here is a look at how we keep things moving specifically for our two boys, organised more or less into the same categories Katy Bowman uses:

Life off-grid in Sakleshpur by its very nature ticked almost all our movement boxes in one fell swoop, and was perfectly stacked with food and daily life tasks necessitating all-day every-day outside movement.This wasn’t intentional, but I had quickly realised when Uppu was small that being outside + being active = happiness, and it was this that gradually took us to living full time in the jungle.

Now that we are in England, things have changed.Living in a conventional house means that we no longer need to collect firewood and light fires to cook, nor to wash our clothes by hand, nor to walk back and forth between our (outdoor) kitchen and other living areas.There is less substantial food to forage here, and we no longer live and work alongside a large and varied community of travellers and friends almost entirely outdoors from dawn to dusk.So life is certainly less inherently stacked and less outside than in Sakleshpur, but we have found ways to get out and keep the movement going.

Clothing

A minimal approach to clothing (t shirt and shorts, or nothing at all; sandals or bare feet) worked in the warmth of southern India.Here, on this rain- and wind-swept island, you need a lot more clothes especially if you want to spend time outside.We keep a few smart but movement-restricting clothes for special occasions, but otherwise the boys wear flexible, short, quick-drying shorts (Uppu actually took this call on his own, unprompted by me, after trying several other types of shorts he had been given and finding he couldn’t run comfortably in them) for all but the coldest months.The top half seems to be much easier, for boys at least; none of their t shirts or jumpers restrict movement. They also have full rain gear – which isn’t so easy to move in but does at least mean they can be out for longer when it does rain heavily.We haven’t yet found a solution to the wellies conundrum.Every type of wellies we’ve looked at or used, even those branded as minimalist, are heavy, rigid, narrow at the toe and clompy to walk in.Wellies here are an all-year-round necessity so I’m hoping to find some kind of a solution.

Food

We are using Dad’s old paddock as a miniature homestead and spend many hours there each day working with the trees and the bees, the poultry and the pumpkins to produce our own food.

Having animals – in our case for eggs and honey – seems a neat way to address many needs at once.Theos still loves to have a go at whatever task I’m doing – watering, weeding, raking – but in general the main attraction of the vegetable garden is as a seasonal snack bar: cucumber, tomatoes, peas, mange tout, strawberries, gooseberries, redcurrants and even raw broad beans and sweetcorn.Our fowls though are an endless source of fascination: chicks and ducklings to be held, adult birds to be chased and caught (something best done by under 10s well practised at playing ‘It’), runs and coops to be built/moved/dismantled/cleaned.And all this in addition to getting us out first thing and last thing every day without fail – the joys…Growing up with the responsibility of caring for animals, and having a chance to closely observe and live beside them, helps in so many ways – and moves us in so many ways.I’m wondering now if there’s a corner of the field big enough for sheep (we have friends who look after orphan lambs through spring and summer and get the meat in return), goats, pigs, cows… But onto our dogs, who don’t feed us but do provide plenty of rough and tumble play time for the boys, as well as needing to be walked, washed, dried and brushed.

House

Inside the house, we follow many of Katy’s ideas for low or no furniture. I also get the boys to help with housework and cooking.Mostly this is because I think everybody in the family should chip in, and they need to learn to fend for themselves; but it also means they get to move about a bit when they are indoors.One hack I’ve found very useful is to mop our hard floors the Indian way: squatting on the floor with a wet rag and bucket, and moving with squat-lunge type movements over the floor as you mop.This makes up in part for the lost squatting time we used to have while washing clothes.We have also built ourselves a Lillipad squatting platform for the loo so we eliminate in the best possible position, and the boys don’t lose that crucial ability to squat.We had couple of sets of rings which we had set up in the cowshed, where we first lived, and got all of us hanging every day.The boys quickly learnt all kinds of stunts and spent hours on the rings, just because they were there.We haven’t found a way to put the rings up in our cottage and as a result we’ve all stopped hanging and the boys’ upper arm strength has visibly diminished.We could set them up in our garage, which has beams, but I doubt anyone would ever go there to use them. As Katy points out again and again, if it’s there we’ll use it.This goes both ways: we sit on the sofa because it’s there; if it isn’t we sit on the floor.

Ah how we miss those rings

School

Uppu, now 8, is at school full time and that means he spends ways more time than we would like sitting and indoors.He is sociable and loves school though, so rather than interfere with that instead we cycle to school almost every day in the rain, snow, hail, wind…and occasionally sun.We are helping him become independent in meeting friends who live more than walking distance away by building him up to cycling several miles alone on reasonably busy roads to reach their houses.An alternative school – such as Waldorf – would have almost certainly prioritised outdoor time, nature and movement more but there are many other advantages to being at a local state primary, and perhaps in time we can push for more active, outdoor school days, at least in the summer.

Community

Our off-grid community has been replaced with a large extended family, including our newest addition Tom and Memthoi’s baby Mili who is almost four months.We live in separate houses a stone’s throw apart which means the boys spend a lot of their time running from one house to another looking for someone, running errands or raiding the biscuit tin.In the middle roughly of all three houses is our paddock-homestead where many of us often work together, stacking social, food, outdoor and movement needs nicely.

Mili at our campfire circle

When we meet up with friends we try to do so in an outside space, like the beach or for a long walk.Covid has of course massively helped this by pushing everyone towards outdoor meetups, and anyway, as many other parents have found, children always get along better when they’re not inside and surrounded by toys.When we have people over we often do campfire suppers.Our campfire/barbeque area is inconveniently low with tree trunks for seats and no table. I love it because it means we get to cook outside AND while squatting, and of course inconvenient for adults means perfect for small children.

Holidays involve a large tent and often another family or two, semi-wild camping with sea- or river-swims for showers and whole days with no indoors at all.

Our outdoor kitchen

I should add that if this all sounds, and looks, fairly idyllic, and you are picturing the boys scampering across lush sun-warmed grass, remember that most of the year the weather is rubbish.Some winter days we’re lucky to manage even a couple of hours outdoors, and this summer has been so wet we’ve barely needed to get the watering cans out.
