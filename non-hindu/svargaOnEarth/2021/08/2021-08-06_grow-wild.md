Grow Wild

I love Katy Bowman.She is one of those rare scientists (her field is biomechanics) who is brilliant at explaining the hows and why-it-matters, as well as at providing practical solutions. Her writing is full of the kind of insights that make you sit up and reconfigure your entire world view (a la Yuval Noah Harari and Jared Diamond); it’s also fun and, at the risk of sounding American, sassy.

Katy’s specialism is understanding how the human body needs to move for optimum health and then translating that into actionable ideas that everyone can do.She’s written [eight books](https://www.nutritiousmovement.com/the-books-ive-written/), at the last count, some looking at the bigger picture of movement (vs. exercise) and how it fits into our past and present, and others giving more specific guidance on topicslike transitioning to minimalist footwear or moving well as you grow older.As a mother of young children she has also done a whole lot of interesting stuff on movement as it relates to pregnancy, birth, babyhood, breastfeeding…and of course kids.*G*[*row Wild: The Whole-Child, Whole-Family Nature-Rich Guide to Moving More*](https://www.nutritiousmovement.com/product/grow-wild-the-whole-child-whole-family-nature-rich-guide-to-moving-more-paperback/)is her latest offering, and focuses on children’s movement, or lack of.The fact that “human children have never moved as little as they move today” is causing problems far beyond the well recognised issues of obesity and poor mental health.And it’s worth clarifying here that ‘movement’ isn’t some fancy new term for exercise; rather exercise is a small part of a much bigger whole called movement.“Human movement is*any change in shape of the body*.”It encompasses recognisable movements – jumping, bending – as well as the less visible stuff that goes on inside our body, the way our heart beats, the way our eyes focus on near and far objects, and even the way our cells are moved when we stay in the same position for a long time – hint, sitting for hours is fundamentally affecting us at the cellular level, and not in a good way.

“For almost the entire human timeline, movement has been woven into all aspects of humanity, beginning at birth.Eating, learning, dressing, playing, building, foraging, celebrating, and traveling all required changing your body position over and over again, in different ways.Movement was inseparable from human necessities; every task was accomplished through movement. Millennia after millennia, children’s bodies grew up experiencing all-day every-day movement via loads created by walking and being carried a variety of miles each day, squatting, sprinting, climbing, jumping, digging, gathering, play-huntnig, carrying, hanging, and sitting and lying on hard ground.The bodies that resulted could withstand all the movement required to succeed in that environment once they became adults.It’s a perfect biofeedback loop: the work required to meet your biological needs today creates a shape capable of continuing that work tomorrow.”

Human ingenuity has put paid to this environment and we now have “a society stuffed with conveniences that save us movement”.The problem, as Katy states, is this: “our bodies and basic biological needs are the*same*as those of our ancestors who moved all day, every day, for everything they needed. Our physiology still*requires*all those bends, flexes, loads, lifts, and jumps as we’re growing; all we’ve eliminated is the environment that easily prompted us to move.”

And all this sitting and stillness “is a contributing factor to the majority of the health issues we and our children now face.”Our lack of movement is making us ill.

So that’s the why of it.Most of the book focuses on easy baby steps we can all take to add movement opportunities back into our lives.And the key to it all is what Katy calls ‘stacking’, meeting basic human needs to eat, move, socialise, be outdoors, play and learn at the same time as far as possible.An example Katy gives is Soup Night: they invite friends round for an outdoor meal and round it off with a walk.This ticks several boxes: community, food, nature and movement. To the idea of stacking I’d add this: looking at movement as a means to some other end, rather than an end in itself.Just as with food, children don’t eat healthy things because they’re healthy.If you want them to eat well the food needs to taste good, or have a story around it, or be in some way connected to the child (this is the cucumber you just harvested), or be novel, or be part of a meal with others – or all of the above.Running up a track for exercise is something only adults do, but running up a track trying to tag each other is something that can be played endlessly, and often lasts much longer than mum’s 10k.Adults will drink a shot of wheatgrass or do 50 push-ups each day because it’s good for them. Children don’t work that way.

It is our environment that has removed the need for movement so it is our environment needs to change.And not only that, the very culture in which we live reinforces our sedentariness, mandates it even.This for me is epitomised in the parks in Indian cities that have signs saying ‘No Playing’, but there are plenty less extreme examples.How many times are children told – at school, in public places, at home – ‘Don’t run!’ or ‘Don’t climb on that!’? But it’s also about the more subtle cultural expectations that children should be ‘well behaved’, ie: still and quiet, in many settings and situations.As Katy says, under a photo of a boy doing a handstand on a table in a restaurant: “I know what it’s like to feel uncomfortable when my children’s movement disrupts a sedentary space.It is so much easier to force the movement out of our kids than to put the movement back into our culture.” Movement needs to be explicitly or implicitly permitted, and we adults also need to model a much more movement-rich life, because children do as we do not as we say.And although for the purposes of this book that mainly means the home environment because it is here that we have most control, there is no shying away from the fact that school is a hugely sedentary place.“The single thing kids practice the most at school isn’t reading or math. It’s sitting in a chair.”

Katy cycles through the most movement-important aspects of our children’s home lives, from the clothes and shoes they wear (which often restrict movement) to the furniture that shapes them.Special scorn is reserved for the chair\* in its various formats, from pram to sofa.It’s not that we, and our children, don’t need to rest, but that we now rest almost solely on cushioned surfaces and in reclining or semi-reclining positions – rather than while squatting, sitting cross legged, lying on our stomachs, or stretched out on a hillside.And she also discusses, as neutrally as possible given the facts, the role movement plays in breastfeeding (it turns out breast is best not just in terms of nutrition and bonding, but also for optimum development of the jaw and teeth which likely impacts how well we chew and breathe throughout our lives, as well as keeping the dentist away) and carrying/wearing babies rather than sticking them into buggies, carry cots, bouncy chairs etc.

All of this is accompanied by a huge array of photographs (submitted by movement enthusiasts worldwide; there’s one of Uppu and Shravanya scrubbing clothes on our washing stone in Sakleshpur) showing children moving in all kinds of ways, designed to get small minds to see movement possibilities.There are also practical lists of what to do and how, aimed at parents and also caregivers and educators.

Another movement-killer is the great indoors.The ‘greenhouses’ we live in cut us off from the outside world and thus the impetus that outside world gives us to move.“Just as greenhouses don’t facilitate any movement of plants…our increasingly complex houses have been keeping growing kids from the nature and movement they need. Walls literally block out the non-human parts of the world…, but more importantly, the new shape of our houses and the stuff inside them has reversed the way we use shelter.Instead of using inside as a place to rest after a day spent outside, we now spend most of our time inside.Our work, leisure, and community have all mostly shifted inside.…That indoor diet has been cemented by the fact that we have not only gotten rid of outside, but we’ve put all the things kids and adults use inside.This eliminates the pressures that once got us all to leave the hut naturally.”

So a lot of what Katy advocates involves getting outside and doing whatever you do – eating, working, playing, seeing friends – there instead of inside.And on the other hand making indoors more outdoors-like, with opportunities and requirements to move more.

Food is the biggest of Katy’s “containers”.As she explains, it was food that got people moving all through human history.That has changed, and how.“Food has never been moved so much at the industrial level and the people eating it have never moved so little.”We no longer need to forage for our supper, spend a day sprinting after a buffalo to bring it to ground, climb a tree in the hope of stealing some honey, or walk every morning to the river for drinking water.We do though still spend a lot of time procuring, preparing and eating food, and it is here that Katy sees lots of scope for us to reintroduce movement and outdoor time.Her examples include: eating breakfast on the grass, going on a walk to gather berries for pudding, or grinding spices with a pestle and mortar.

I was first introduced to Katy Bowman during our early Sakleshpur days, and read*Move Your DNA*a good three years ago so we’ve been aware of and heavily influenced by her ideas for a while now.Reading*Grow Wild*has been a good excuse to reassess our own movement equation now that we’re living a very different life in rural England.Watch this space for a follow up post on how we are managing to keep things moving in our current set up. In the meantime, go read*Grow Wild*.

\*Interestingly Katy doesn’t equate sitting with smoking, but instead compares screens to cigarettes: “When cigarettes first emerged they were everywhere and there was an *entire generation* that began smoking quite young. Several decades elapsed before a set of “use practices” was developed. Right now, parents and alloparents are the first generation to have to deal with raising children who are completely inundated with media devices. There is no framework offering guidance, likely because there is little understanding of this emerging (peaking?) problem. There are very few accepted good-use practices, and almost none of them relate to movement. As we put more devices in more places, and put more activities (education, entertainment, community) online, the baseline for “how much time is all right” keeps increasing. This is because the recommendations aren’t trying to match our environments to our biology; they are matching them to our culture.”
