The Joys of DIY

We are deep in DIY country here. Every self respecting household has a drill at the very least, and many have fully kitted out, insulated workshops where they can fine tune their motorbikes or create a beautiful bench for their garden. Dorchester, our nearest town, is awash with building suppliers, plumbers’ merchants, painter and decorator shops, and agricultural and horticultural mega-stores. And if you want to put up say a shed you buy it off the shelf, flat-packed, and then assemble it yourself.

India is very different. Labour is cheap and tradesmen abundant.
Everything, from sewing a torn button back onto a shirt, to modding a rally car, can be done by someone else cheap and fast. It’s more of a hassle and, if specialised tools are needed, much more expensive, to do the job yourself. So most people don’t. This can make you lazy; it certainly made me lazy, despite inwardly wishing I could be a DIY goddes. Necessity and all that. 

Since our arrival here, we’ve been on a forced learning curve which started with how to switch a drill on and ended with building a polytunnel (a weekend job which saw us working dawn to dusk for two solid weeks). Ended is perhaps the wrong word. We still have a long long way to go.

On Boxing Day as I lay on my back in a cold, wet cupboard being dripped on by the disconnected sink waste pipe, there was a large part of me that wished we could have just called our Mr Fix It in Bangalore who would have had the job done in half an hour for the princely sum of 500 rupees, including parts. Instead, we had had to call an emergency plumber out. He had come only to announce that ours wasn’t an emergency – an emergency would have to be water coming through the ceiling he said; water spouting onto the kitchen counter didn’t qualify – patched up the tap with a repair job that lasted all of 10 minutes, and told us that we were welcome to call his office when they opened, in a week’s time, to book an appointment for someone to come and fix a new tap.
They were pretty booked up, though, so we’d be lucky to get an appointment in their first week of re-opening. And no he neither had a new tap, nor could he get one and bill us, nor could he wait half an hour while we raced to the nearest shop to get one for him to fit. With the choice of a water-soaked kitchen for two weeks, or the possibility of a real emergency if we cocked up the new tap job ourselves, we opted for the latter. And with a little guidance from a builder friend we miraculously managed to do it.

The more convenient we make our living arrangements the more complicated they become. No plumber ever visited The Wildside, nor did we have any specialised equipment, flat-packed assemblies or installation videos.
The trick was not having any plumbing, so to speak. Water was pumped from our pond in large overground pipes that filled 2,000 litre tanks.
These were raised off the ground on mounds of mud so that when we switched on the hosepipe at their base gravity brought the water to wherever we needed it. Generally that would be a smaller 200 litre barrel into which people then scooped mugs to wash their hands or do the dishes. The most complicated it got was a solar water heater in our house which brought water in through a tap (how we appreciated the convenience of that tap when we fitted it two years down the line) to our bathroom. All of this could easily be set up and maintained by the admittedly extremely skilled Bharath with nothing more than his machete and perhaps a hammer or pair of pliers.

Running water certainly makes life much easier, but it also increases our dependence on specialists and specialist tools.

In the days before India allowed motorbikes to be imported, almost everyone used Royal Enfield Bullets to ride around the country. They broke down frequently but responded well if you stopped for a half hour smoke and chai break on the side of the road or perhaps a whack with a spanner, and if it was really bad every village and every town had a dozen mechanics who had enough of an idea about Bullets to fix you up, until the next breakdown at least. When the Harleys started rolling in, only the authorised service centre could fix them. Yes they didn’t break down so often, but when they did you were screwed unless you were within 250km of the Harley showroom.

From setting up camp on the riverbank, to collecting water in a vessel for immediate needs, to storing water in containers for use throughout the day, to irrigation for agriculture, to pipes and modern plumbing in the home, we have come a long way. Innovation and technology have brought us wonderful things, and made everyday life more convenient and more comfortable. We have though traded the simplicity of a crude system which requires more day-to-day work and basic maintenance, and some amount of knowledge and skill, for an elaborate masterpiece we understand not at all which works beautifully until the day it doesn’t leaving you at the mercy of extremely expensive and often unavailable specialists.

Unfortunately, or fortunately perhaps for the other members of my family, we are not in a position to dismantle the complex system of overhead tanks, boiler, hot water cylinder, pressure pump, soil stacks, cisterns, isolators, taps, stopcocks and sewage pipes in our cottage, so there’s only one solution: learn how to work the damn thing ourselves.
