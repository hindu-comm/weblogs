A Different Type of Nourishment

[![](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/img-0763.jpg?w=768)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/img-0763.jpg)

Our mini homestead in the field here was set up with the grand notion of self sufficiency. Vegetables, lentils, fruit, eggs, honey and perhaps eventually some kind of grain and meat to feed all three families. The end of the supermarket shop and chemically grown food.

It hasn’t quite worked out like that. Often there are enough vegetables to mean none of us has to buy any, in theory, but in practice people find it difficult to give up avocados altogether, or not to have fresh tomato and cucumber in winter. Ours is the only family that more or less survives without buying in, and that’s only because militant me does the food shopping, or more accurately doesn’t. We can and do preserve, and I have a friend who takes our produce and turns it into delicious jars of fermented fare, but you would need bigger harvests and a lot more manpower to preserve enough to get through the lean months.
The fruit trees and bushes will take several more years to be significant. The eggs are at times plentiful but never quite enough for all ten of us, and the fact that the chickens require a lot of purchased inputs in the form of feed and bedding does trouble me. We’ve talked about meat birds for the meat eaters but since no one has really been able to handle slaughtering even the cockerels and drakes I doubt it will happen. Pigs and lambs too have been discussed, and the dirty business of killing them could be outsourced, but not everyone is keen. And the honey has remained a bit of a pipe dream as I’ve been unable to work the hive(s) since I became pregnant. 

So we’re not self sufficient, and probably never will be, but the field has simultaneously provided us with a different and perhaps even more important type of nutrition in the form of movement, nature and community.

Where other children are invited for playdates, we organise field-dates. The chickens are the number one attraction for any visitors, and people make special visits to come see our ducklings and chicks. Egg collecting and chicken feeding provide a leisurely, daily get-out-of-the-house activity. Chicken catching (to return escapees to the fold or to apply medicine) is a once in a while agility and speed test. And even the dreaded mucking out often attracts little helpers.

The horticultural side of things provides more movement, and more involvement for old and young. Some days it’s just a quick five minute dash to sow some seeds. Others, it’s a back-breaking eight hours of collecting horse manure from down the road, or the great all-hands-on-deck potato harvest. There is raking, shovelling, watering, digging, plucking, cutting, sowing, planting, pruning, clearing. There is squatting, bending, reaching up, lifting, carrying. And in all weather. Almost all of us go into the vegetable garden and fruit cage at least once a day during the season, some to work and some to harvest, and we all almost always have at least one or two children in tow (or in Devamrita’s case, on my back). Uppu now only does big jobs (for which he gets paid) but Theos and Mili still love to dig holes and plant seeds for the fun of it. And while there the kids love to snack on whatever’s growing, right from sorrel at the start of the season through the carrots, strawberries, mange tout, gooseberries, currants, cucumbers, tomatoes, sweetcorn and raspberries – all raw, mostly unwashed and straight from plant to mouth (when I collect, prepare and serve the same produce at home they often don’t want to eat it, so I’ve figured it’s easier to let them get their daily nutrient fix themselves). I’ve had to go down there late in the evening to get the boys back because they were so busy gorging on peas they had lost track of the time. 

If we are at a loose end with the children or want to get them or ourselves outdoors, it’s the field we head to. There is always something going on, something to do or see, or eat. It is also a middle ground, a neutral space that belongs to everyone and no one. We have campfires and picnics there, sleepovers and birthday parties. Our community consists of just our three families, but I can well imagine how a community garden would work in terms of bringing people together.

There are many things I’ll miss about England when we return to India next month, quite apart from family: the British sense of humour, bread, grass, life without traffic. But it is the field I most wish I could pack in my suitcase and take with me. For all that it has given and continues to give us: the most delicious, most local, most fresh, and most healthful food. Movement and movements big and small. Sunlight and fresh air, wind and rain and ice. Soil and mud, bugs and bees and birds, budding trees and an ever changing river. And companionship and togetherness.
