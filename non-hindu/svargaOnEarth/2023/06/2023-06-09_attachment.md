Attachment

Striving to meet everyone’s needs: Chloe has some tummy time while I learn my diastasis recti exercises and the boys play football

Just after Uppu was born I read *The Continuum Concept* and it shook my whole world up. Ten years later I’m having a similar lightening bolt moment with *Hold onto Your Kids* by Dr Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate.
There’s a whole lot to unpack in this book. I can feel a blog post or three brewing and I’m not even half way through yet. 

The thing that is keeping my mind a-spin right now is attachment and how it changes as children grow. At zero, five and ten years respectively, our children make for a good, evenly spaced study group. 

Chloe is four months old. She spends almost all of her day in physical contact with me, either sleeping next to me or being carried by me.
Touch is primary. When she’s practising her crawling or being held my someone else, she’s no longer physically connected and her eyes search for and follow me hungrily. If she can’t see me, especially in the car seat which legally has to be rear-facing in this country, I reassure her that I’m still there by talking or singing to her. Our babies have always had an inbuilt wifi signal monitor as Gautam calls it, and I only have to try and sneak out of bed to go to the loo at night for their alarm to go off. Nature has programmed babies to need their mothers as close as possible all day and all night because that was the only way they could survive. That we no longer live in the jungle, that we now have the great indoors and formula milk makes no difference to this instinctual sense of need. 

Theos is five. He still sleeps cuddled up to me or Gautam, and still needs lots of touch day and night. He is also though happy to spend hours away from us with grandparents, uncles and aunts (and friends provided it’s on his turf) so long as he knows we’re there and will be there when he gets back. If for any reason he finds us missing (or thinks he might find us missing) when he returns home, he panics. He’s not yet ready to go spend time with people he doesn’t know, say in a school or class setting or even at a good friend’s house for a playdate, unless one of us is there waiting on the sidelines. He’s constantly pushing the boundaries and testing how far he can be apart from us and still feel safe. He spent his first night away from us recently – next door in Granny’s bed, but still… In his case, though, over and above the physical attachment is what Neufeld and Mate term emotional and psychological attachment. He wants to talk to us, share things with us, play with us. This is the age of constant, urgent imperatives: ‘Look at this!’, ‘Watch me!’, ‘Listen!’, ‘Come here!’, ‘Help!’ And always now, now, now.

Uppu has just turned ten. He still wants to sleep as close to us as possible, and often wants to hold my hand as he falls asleep, but has largely been shunted out of direct contact by the two smaller ones so now settles for a mattress next to ours. So a decade in and the physical attachment stage certainly isn’t over. During the day though he isn’t often physically affectionate and there’s a certain self consciousness now – I don’t kiss him when his friends are around. He goes for sleepovers and has spent whole weeks away with his grandparents. What he seeks from us is less physical more mental, to be able to have a conversation about who’s going where in the transfer window, or to rant about a classmate at school, or to break down because his team lost. He still wants to know where we are, and he doesn’t like it if he gets home from school and there’s no one there, but he gets grumpy rather than panicky.  When he’s not at school, he doesn’t lean on us for company as much as Theos does, and is more often than not busy either with friends or a book or football cards, but again he wants us to be available to him when he needs us.

It’s intense for sure. At the moment doubly so because I’ve got no Gautam around for the four months we’re back in the UK. When Chloe is crying, Theos wants me to read a book and Uppu is half way through telling me about a friend who betrayed his trust, I struggle. I can manage them physically but I can’t meet everyone’s emotional and psychological needs simultaneously; 3:1 is not a good ratio.  And if it wasn’t for Granny and Grandpa living next door I wouldn’t have lasted more than a couple of weeks. 

When I look back on these ten years I realise that while I’ve always been present physically for the children, I often haven’t had the mind space for them. I stopped my translating and publishing work soon after Uppu was born to be with him, and then Theos and Chloe, full time all the time, but our lives have been complicated and in constant flux. We have moved house about 15 times over this period. And many things have vyed for my attention, not always unavoidably. Many of them, from setting up an off grid idyll to making our own bread, I’ve done for the children, but what they need more than a jungle home or a healthy sandwich is my time and attention. Just as what they need from Gautam is him to be there, rather than the things his earnings can buy. Even when life is smoother and less busy, it’s difficult to always be mentally present and available at the precise moment they need you.
When I am writing this blog post for instance it sucks me in and I find it difficult to surface back to the here and now when one of them needs my attention. When Uppu comes home from school, I have to remind myself that my job isn’t just to feed him and turn him round for football training but also to listen and engage if he wants to talk. It’s not about becoming child-centred, which I have always tried to avoid, but rather living purposeful, active adult lives which they can participate in, while making space for them to engage in our lives at their own pace and in their own way. It’s also a lot about slowing down, which doesn’t come naturally to me.

The other thing I realise now that Uppu has hit double digits is that most of our allotted time with him is already over. He will naturally grow further away from us in every sense as he reaches maturity and independence. Once he reaches his second decade he may well no longer be in the same house, or even the same country as us. We can’t afford to miss a single moment with any of them, for their sake or ours.
