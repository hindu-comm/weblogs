Off Grid and Off Sick Don’t Mix

If you’ve ever got ill while camping, you’ll know what I mean. Hale and hearty, anyone who has the desire and temperament to do so can live without mod cons. Ill or injured, very few can.

We have elderly friends in Bangalore who spent years creating a beautiful solar-powered homestead with a productive vegetable garden, cows for milk and lots of fruit trees. When they were finally able to retire and move out of the city, a chronic illness sadly made it all but impossible for them to live there full-time. I’ve been reading Atulya K Bingham’s account of her life alone on a remote Spanish mountain, attempting almost singlehandedly to convert a lovely old barn into a live-able space. It was difficult to begin with, but when she had a car accident there was no way she could return there until she was fully recovered. 

Living for several years in Sakleshpur with small children and Gautam away brought its fair share of challenges, but the only times that I really felt like running back to the city was one or all of us was sick or hurt. The simplest of things like making lunch for the boys became terrifyingly daunting when I was reeling with a fever: to have to walk a hundred yards to the kitchen with said children, collect wood and then start and maintain a fire, before I could even think about cooking something. We tended to survive on fruit and khakhra those days.
Similarly while I always enjoyed washing our clothes by hand, I longed for a washing machine (or at least another couple of arms) when one of the boys was being sick every five minutes and needing to be held round the clock. Injuries often affected our ability to move around, and when you need to move for every basic necessity, and across uneven ground, it’s tough. And trying to keep a lime burn sterile or a cut from getting infected is much more difficult when you’re not living in the squeaky clean environment of a modern house. The worst was when a six-month-old Theos got a bad head injury and with the jeep away I had to walk to the village with him drowsy and bleeding. I ended up catching lifts with two neighbours (the first car broke down) and eventually made it to the government hospital in town where he was treated. 

In the yurt things are definitely easier. I’m next door to family – and their houses – when needed, and never far away from medical facilities.
Still when every step is an effort, the short slope down to the garage to get drinking water seems like a trek. And managing widely fluctuating day- and night-time temperatures when all you want to do is lie in bed is sometimes so exhausting that I decamped to my parents last time I had mastitis rather than try to get through a cold night here with fever chills and no energy to light a fire.

It is at these times that the lure of running hot and cold water, fans or heating at the flick of a switch, a modern kitchen and bathrooms, and flat floors is strong. Fleeting but strong.
