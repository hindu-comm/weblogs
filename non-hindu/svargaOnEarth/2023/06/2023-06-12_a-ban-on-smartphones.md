A Ban on Smartphones?

Juliet Samuel in *The Times* this week called for a ban on smartphones for under 16s. What joyous tidings that would be for all of us parents fighting the smartphone and social media battle with our children. Not only would it make smartphones disappear for most pre-sixth form kids, it would also send a clear message to us as a society that smartphones are up there with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, something potentially dangerous and harmful from which we need to protect minors. In fact, worries about your teenager smoking behind the bike shed, binge drinking, experimenting with ketamine, or even becoming pregnant at 15 seem rather quaint nowadays. Those things at least happen in real life. The biggest concern today is mental health, the messed up inner world of teenagers afflicted by anxiety and depression, harming or even killing themselves and others mindlessly. And it is social media which tends to fuel and amplify this to fever pitch. 

In general, legislating against anything only increases its allure for youth, and there would always be a way round the rules for the most persistent. Still it would be a huge step towards acknowledging what Samuel calls the “the real youth epidemic of our times”. At the moment, she says, parents are either resisting, in which case they risk social isolation for their child (and incessant arguments about it at home), or have capitulated and regret it. And then there are those whose children haven’t yet reached smartphone age (about 10 I reckon) who are just hoping the problem will go away before their time is due. It won’t, not unless we all do something about it. We were in that last category until last September when Uppu started middle school. The problem didn’t miraculously disappear and we are now in a situation where almost every one of the 100 plus children in his year has a smartphone except for him. 

Uppu has one of those classic clamshell phones (true retro chic, if only his friends would appreciate it) with which he can call us when he cycles to and from friends’ houses or the local football pitch, as well as calling his friends up in the old fashioned way. He uses my smartphone to do the occasional video call with his friends, especially when we’re in India and he hasn’t seen them for a while, but there is also increasing pressure to join group video calls on Whatsapp with a gang of school mates. We have had various screen allowances for him over the last few years, but it is always much much less than his peers. He doesn’t have a gaming console (again one of the only ones in school who doesn’t) but Gautam has just bought him a wifi-only tablet so he can do an hour a week playing Fifa, and watch football matches and read articles on OneFootball. I’ve said no to Call of Duty, which involves a fair amount of killing but which again everyone else plays, and to most other games where you can chat to others because of the online safety issues.The screen in general has always been a bugbear, but I am now starting to make much finer distinctions between different types of screen time. Watching *Big Bang Theory* seems utterly benign compared to having an Instagram profile you check every 10 minutes.

Uppu was telling me the other day that the popular ones in school are those who introduce the latest YouTube meme or TikTok craze. And he also announced this weekend that only nerds read books outside the classroom; this from a boy whose hunger for books is insatiable – we took out about 40 books (the thickest we could find) from Dorchester Library when we left for India in December and he had run out by January. The school doesn’t allow pupils to bring their phones into school, but they do anyway; and on the bus it’s a free-for-all. He used to take a book into read on the bus; now he just watches his friends gaming over their shoulder. He’ll be leaving this school in July when we move back to India, but if he was staying I wonder how long we could have held out, trying to balance our need to shelter him from all of this until we feel he’s mature enough to handle it, and his need to fit in and belong. 

It is, as the article says, a “classic collective action problem”. Many friends I’ve spoken to about this feel that we will look back in a couple of decades and be shocked and appalled at how we exposed our kids for so long to something so pernicious. It will become as socially unacceptable to give a small child a screen, or a pre-teen a smartphone, as it now is to smoke in the same room as children. But until that point comes we really are up against it, so any kind of government legislation can only help by reducing the prevalence of these phones and changing attitudes.

In the meantime, the only thing Gautam and I feel we can do is shelter our three as far as possible and delay the inevitable as long as possible in the hope that by the time they do have their own phone and become active on social media they are emotionally mature enough to become neither addicted nor overly affected by every like or absence of. For us in India that is going to mean choosing an alternative school where there will hopefully be less devices and more conscious parents, a bubble essentially from real life where they can avoid smartphones and social media without becoming misfits.
