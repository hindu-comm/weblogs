(Don’t) Sit Down!

Lunch yurt style; one advantage of having a draughty shed for a kitchen is that there’s not much sitting down at a table to eat

I’m reading Katy Bowman’s book on diastasis recti at the moment. For those who haven’t come across DR, it’s best known as the separation of your abdomen into two halves and is very often associated with pregnancy. Katy, though, true to form, looks at it from the whole-body, lifestyle angle and explains how fixing it requires more than just a few ab-toning exercises.

She attributes most of the blame for this core weakness (of which DR is just a symptom) to sitting. Sitting on chairs in the house, in school and in the office. Sitting down to eat, to work and to socialise.
Sitting in cars, on public transport, on planes. We spend an awful lot of our day sitting and most of that sitting time is the wrong type of sitting – slouching into chairs and sofas – rather than sitting unsupported (think cross legged on the floor). All this supported sitting puts our core muscles out of a job and that’s where the problems start.

Sitting as the new smoking is old hat by now, but Katie has a simple sitting quiz which brought home to me just how much Uppu sits by virtue of being at school. Here’s how to take the quiz:

On a typical day Theos and I spend about 15-20% of our waking hours sitting. At the moment I’m breastfeeding Chloe and more than half of our sitting minutes are when she’s having milk. As an aside, I wonder whether Katy has figured out some comfortable ‘good’ sitting positions for breastfeeding; sitting on the floor to breastfeed or even cross legged on a bed is fine only if you have a stack of pillows or you’re only doing it for a couple of minutes. When you breastfeed each child for several years the chair and sofa time adds up. Why can’t human babies just get up and latch on independently like all other mammal infants..?

But back to sitting. Uppu spends about 55% of his waking hours on a school day sitting: about an hour on the school bus, then 5.5 hours of classes with two breaks (which include eating lunch, and if it’s wet then they have to be indoors sitting down during break anyway) totalling an hour and sometimes a get-up-and-walk-to-the-next-classroom bit of movement. They have two fairly token PE classes a week. Some children that struggle to sit still and concentrate for long periods of time are given medication.

The office-going world was long ago introduced to concepts such as walking meetings and standing desks but is anyone trying to do the same on a large scale in mainstream schools? Certainly not in this country.
How about getting rid of chairs in the classroom and having all the pupils sit on the floor with low tables – as pre-schools sometimes do, and as many alternative schools in India do even with older children?
Or having standing assemblies? Or taking the odd lesson outside in the summer term?
