The State Creche

We seem to be the only parents who actually look forward to having our child home for the holidays

For families where both parents work, and that’s the majority given the sky-high cost of living here, the British state school system is a godsend. It offers a decent standard of education, yes, but more importantly it provides toddler-to-teenager childcare completely for free. By their third birthday children are entitled to 15 hours of free preschool a week, and from four onwards all children are guaranteed a funded place at a school near them. The school day is reasonably long, generally 8:45 to 3:15, with the option of pre and post-day care and/or after school clubs at a subsidised cost. And school terms cover most of the year, about 41 weeks. In a society with very few other childcare options – no joint families with grandparents living at home, and nannies who cost more than what many parents earn – all this means that it’s possible, just, for both mum and dad to work.

For the government, freeing up parents from their role as childcare providers means that there are more adults in the workforce, which boosts productivity and ultimately the economy During Covid, the government prioritised schools above everything else and most children missed only a few weeks as opposed to months or years in other countries. Children of key workers -which covers nurses, doctors and teachers as well as journalists, government employees and supermarket cashiers – were entitled to go to school throughout, even if they just sat in a classroom with a teaching assistant playing on iPads. For all their talk of education, the government’s primary concern during Covid, and perhaps always, was offering a creche service to enable parents to go into work. As a result state schools do a fair amount of time-filler activities which if we’re honest have no real educational benefit nor even tick any of the get-active, get-outdoors, get-creative boxes. By the end of term, or even just the end of the day, teachers and pupils alike are exhausted and there is an awful lot of colouring in Twinkl print outs and watching films until the day, the week or the term thankfully draws to a close. 

All this would be just fine and dandy if it were optional. If both you and your partner want and need to work, or you’re a single mum or dad, then here is a wonderful free childcare service which makes it possible to combine a full time job with being a parent. Unfortunately though the education system here is not optional, it’s compulsory. If you have the luxury of being a stay-at-home parent and you’d like to take your child out to a museum instead of them sitting in the classroom watching re-runs of ET, you can’t. Once you have registered your child at a school and they are on the system, you are obliged to ensure they go almost every day of the school year until they are 18. The official guidelines recommend attendance targets of 95%; that allows for less than ten days absence a year, including when your child is ill. Most children don’t miss school when they’re sick, they’re just dosed up with calpol and packed onto the school bus, partly because mum and dad need to go to work and partly because those whose children don’t meet attendance targets get into trouble. Parents are sent warnings and eventually fines, and Social Services get involved if children are absent a lot. Uppu’s school homework app not only shows him which maths tasks he needs to do by next week but also what his attendance rate is.
The other day when he wasn’t feeling well he insisted on going because he was anxious that his attendance is down to 92.7%.

Very few parents have an issue with this. For those that do, like us, tough. The system has been designed with the best of intentions, to ensure that no child slips through the net, but it is by necessity a one-size-fits-all approach and there’s no room for anyone who doesn’t fit the mould. Unless you’re officially (or unofficially, in a below the radar type way) home educating, and the government keeps making that more difficult, school’s in forever.
