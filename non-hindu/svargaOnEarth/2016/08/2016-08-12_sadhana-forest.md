Sadhana Forest

![DSC_1349](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dsc_1349.jpg?w=656)

To enter [Sadhana Forest](http://sadhanaforest.org/) is to enter a magical realm. And yet, for those who dismiss off-grid, natural, community living as a fantasy, Sadhana Forest is as real as it gets.

Here, a community of between 50-150 people – families, couples, individuals; some here for a few hours, some for a few years – live a truly low impact lifestyle while working hard to create a flourishing forest where once there was barren land. There is no electricity, but enough solar power to provide essential lighting, internet and charging points, and to filter and pump water. Running water is limited to a few gravity-based outlets; for everything else there is a hand pump and a trademark (simple but extremely effective) Sadhana Forest tap system:

pour water in the steel mug and it starts to trickle out from a tiny hole in the bottom – hey presto you have running water for hand washing

The dormitories, tree-houses and modestly-named ‘main hut’ are all stitched together with wood, thatch, rope and a few supporting stone beams, or fabricated with panels created from waste.

our tree-house

There is a blender, but you need to cycle to make it work. Cooking is done on rocket stoves with firewood collected, cut (by hand) and stock-piled daily by volunteers. The loos are the dry compost variety, naturally, and bathing or washing clothes entails filling a bucket from the hand pump and carrying it back to the bathrooms. You soon learn to wash conservatively. Not a drop of water is wasted here.

The day starts in a surreal way, with a 5am wake up call like no other – it could be the beat of the tabla, or a folk song accompanied by guitar, as the musician who has offered to take this task on for the week walks around the entire camp in the pre-dawn darkness. This is followed by a set of stretches and hugs known as morning circle, and then the day’s work begins – two ‘seva’ shifts of tree mulching, roof repairing, food cooking, loo cleaning, bee repelling and so on, interrupted only by the famous banana breaks where hungry volunteers devour bunches of the freely supplied fruit.

In the afternoons and evenings there are impromptu jamming sessions, aikido workshops, talks on naturalism, swimming in the mud pool and parties where if you’re not careful you might end up consuming a slice of vegan pizza as you discuss your neighbour’s last water-only month-long fast. Despite appearances, this is not an East-Coast Anjuna, and that is what makes it so special.

Children are especially welcome here, and tend to love the combination of freedom and community. They participate in community life in whichever way they choose; we had a nine year old who practised her gymnastics in the dining room, a 12 year old who created a documentary on the seva here, and a two year old who did the watering, naked. There are swings in the dining room, a children’s area where no adults are allowed except with the children’s permission and children’s land, an unschooling project for local children from neighbouring villages.

The work is often physically demanding, living conditions basic and the vegan food not to everyone’s taste. There is a very strictly enforced policy of no tobacco, alcohol or drugs, off or on campus. And then there is the humidity and heat, and a whole battalion of biting insects to contend with, from bed bugs to kambli hulus to huge mosquitoes. Volunteers from abroad (and most are) are asked to commit to at least two weeks here, but not all last. Not that that worries the community here. Everyone is welcome – no one is ever turned away – and anyone is free to go if they choose.

There is a pervasive atmosphere of joy and peace here which I’m sure is due to the influence of the family who founded it and form the backbone of the community: Aviram and Yorit, and their daughters Osher and Shalev. Over the 13 years since they first started to live here, in what was a benighted wasteland, they have not only raised the water table by six metres and planted countless trees thus helping the almost extinct tropical dry evergreen forest to survive, they have also, as Aviram likes to say, tried to grow people.
