Forest Parenting

If children are seeds, then perhaps we should turn to Fukuoka and the forest for guidance. In the forest, seeds grow into huge trees without any help from us. With the right environment, with a nurturing soil, plenty of sunlight and rain, plants flourish. When we take them out of their natural environment and try to intensively rear them in a place or manner unsuited to them, they do not. We then do all we can to replicate what they had in the wild – providing missing nutrients and water, protecting them from predator, injury and infection – in a bid to coax them into growth, so that they might provide us with the produce we have been seeking.

And so with children. If a child’s natural environment is an extended family of mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters; if it is the freedom to grow, moving towards the light in whatever way they choose; if it is a lifestyle and surroundings native to us as a species, then most modern city-dwelling children are like foreign seeds in a small pot filled with poor soil. We, their parents, relatives, friends and teachers, try to provide supplements to aid their growth (for which read education, because to most people growth means only one thing): school; toys; peer contact… And we try to protect them from anything that might put them, or their growth, at risk. Thus we end up with children saturated with artificial nutrients which they cannot absorb, children incapable of fending for or looking after themselves physically, mentally, spiritually. And these children invariably grow up stunted, or diseased, perhaps initially with the appearance of a healthy tree, but internally blighted. And we shake our heads and wonder why, after all our hard work, they did not yield the fruit we had expected of them.
