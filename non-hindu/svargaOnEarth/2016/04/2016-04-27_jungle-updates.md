Jungle Updates

A hotch-potch of thoughts from Sullakki over the last couple of weeks – all in one big blog post and again without photos because I only have a few minutes of internet access:

We had a gaggle of children here recently from Bangalore, and among them were three brothers aged seven to 11. Within minutes of arriving, one of them had climbed a tree deep in the jungle and knocked off a jackfruit. They managed to catch a fish in the river using just a t-shirt. And when they realised the potential for cricket in these wide open spaces, they didn’t ask us to get them a cricket bat and ball, they simply made one themselves. In fact, they made enough for an entire cricket team, all beautifully painted. I was impressed. I hope Uppu turns out to be as resourceful and independent as they are.

After three weeks of digging and mixing piles of mud, filling and carrying bucket after bucket and squatting low to hurl earthen plaster at walls, I have yet to wake up with a single sore muscle. What I do find though is that my feet often ache and that I attribute to my barefootedness. After years of being shod my feet are finally free, and all those atrophied muscles are developing. The pads under my toes have thickened and the many tiny thorns I tread on daily are no more than a minor nuisance now – pull them out and move on. Interestingly (for barefoot enthusiasts at least), I found that after a few days my heels started to crack and become rough. I vaguely thought about rubbing coconut oil in them, but never got round to it. After another week, and lots more stamping mud-plaster mixes, I realised that the cracking and roughness had all but disappeared. Mother nature at her best.

With no internet, and thus no reason for staring into a screen, I have found myself filling the few bits of spare time I have with cleaning. With all the dust and mud, there is no shortage of cleaning to do. At home, as in most Indian households, we are spoilt with Usha, who does all the cleaning and laundry, most of the dish washing, and breakfast. I have often felt uncomfortable with this, but it is so convenient and there seem to always be so many other constraints on my time that I have never done anything about it. Here, I have no option and I am finding it strangely emancipating to be cleaning our own loo, cooking all that we eat (two full meals a day on a wood-fire stove which requires lighting, stoking and ash clearing), and attempting to handwash the mud stains out of our clothes.

Ironic that in Bangalore with all mod-cons, lots of house-help, and none of the physical labour, supervision and planning of our construction projects, I am so busy that if I have to cook breakfast because Usha is away it throws off my whole schedule and stresses me out. At the farm, the days are full to the brim and we always have people staying but it is almost never stressful. Of course it helps that Uppu is very rarely at a loss for things to do, and we never have the need to get out of the house (there is no indoors here), so I can usually get on with whatever task I am doing, construction or household-related, and he either joins in or busies himself in some other activity. We have also had some great friends staying who have helped out hugely in the kitchen and elsewhere, as well as keeping us all company – kind of like a big joint family set up but of like-minded people rather than relatives (not that the two are necessarily mutually exclusive), I love it.

Living in tents in the jungle has made me realise that many of life’s necessities are easy to live without:

What I don’t miss:

running water – a water drum and 1 litre mug is more than sufficient for everything

Western flush loos – our Indian style compost loo is great

electricity – in fact after a storm the village had no power for a few days and several women asked to charge their phones using our solar lights; on the other hand I do charge my laptop occasionally in one of the village houses

fridge – we get fresh milk everyday; we buy lots of fruits and vegetables and go through them at a rate of knots, before they go bad; and we cook fresh meals every morning and evening so really no need for refrigeration. I do though want to come up with a solution for food storage – a cool shady place which is insect proof.

internet – the added advantage of not being online is that you have to fall back on your own common sense and ingenuity (or that of others) rather than Google whenever you want to know how to treat a blister or make bhindi without oil; I think perhaps internet access for one or two hours a week, just to check emails etc, would be nice and certainly more than sufficient provided I didn’t have any publishing work going on

mirrors – we go for days without seeing our reflection and feel all the better for it

What I do miss:

Gautam

washing machine – I send the muddiest clothes back with Gautam to be washed in Bangalore

mixer-grinder/blender/magimix – I miss our juices, soups and chutneys; we also can’t make idli batter

On the earthbag front, I am quite convinced this is a great way to construct – seriously low cost, and requires almost no skill, just lots of people and effort. A few things we have learnt though:

– while the building itself might be low cost, your roof may not so factor that into costings (I plan to do a post later on how much it has cost us to build these two structures in earthbags)

– if building circular you need to ensure that you check your walls are plumb; ours have bent inwards and outwards so far and our door (which wasn’t reinforced as it should have been) has also caused bend problems

– it’s easy to fill the bags but less easy to get them to sit level, so go slow on the laying and tamping and get each course level before beginning the next one

– chicken mesh is not needed for plastering and in fact can make it more difficult

– mud plastering has been our biggest challenge so far; after consulting all kinds of people and books, doing lots of test, some serious hard work and sore hands and feet from the lime, we still keep ending up with huge cracks

Another unanticipated but obvious result of our long sojourn in the rural hinterland of Karnataka is that our Kannada is rapidly improving. Indeed one week I was living and working with only Kannada-speakers – bar Uppu who also speaks Kannada here. Here are some useful (particularly for earthbag building and jungle living) words and phrases I have picked up:

– nari – fox (as in ‘there’s a fox just there in the bushes, I’ll blow the whistle to frighten it away’)

– bich kondu – remove/dismantle (as in ‘can you dismantle this pipe that is blocking the road so we can take the car through; otherwise we will have to try and haul 100 litres of water by foot’)

– bai bai – mouth to mouth (as in ‘lay the bags mouth to mouth’)

– gudli – hoe, not to be confused with gundi which is a trench

– handi – wild boar (as in ‘oh don’t worry those men wondering around near the containers at night with a gun are just hunters shooting wild boar’)

– mangusutini – I lay down (as in ‘where can I put my son to sleep now that our container bedroom has been flooded and everywhere else is covered in construction debris?’)
