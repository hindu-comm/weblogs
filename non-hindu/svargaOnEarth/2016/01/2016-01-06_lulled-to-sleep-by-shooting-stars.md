Lulled to Sleep by Shooting Stars

We were so exhausted by the time we arrived at the farm at about 9ish on 31st December that as soon as we had the tent set we collapsed on a mat in front of it, unable to summon the energy to light our normal campfire despite the fast increasing chill. Without the light of the fire, and with every reason to look up rather than anywhere else, we became the unintentional spectators of the most spectacular show of shooting stars we have ever seen. There were no fireworks or crackers and no music – surprisingly because when you’re in a valley as we are sound travels far and we often hear the not so tasteful tunes of a nearby party (most of the time from a religious event – temples can be the worst offenders when it comes to blaring loud music, and at times music which you wouldn’t think of as spiritual in any sense of the word) – just the three of us shivering under a blanket, entranced as we watched the extraterrestial ping pong.

Gautam’s watch recorded a temperature of 7.6 degrees celsius at dawn, pretty chilly for South India where a sub-20 reading (or sub-30 in Chennai) has every mother reaching for a balaclava for her children. After another disappointingly mild Christmas in England, where the temperature hovered around 12-14 degrees, I’m wondering whether we might have a better chance of snow in Sakleshapur next year…
