Ecologise Here We Come

We are driving up to Sirsi – to a farm called [No Man’s Land](http://www.nomanslandfarm.in/) – in the Western Ghats tomorrow for the [Ecologise](http://www.ecologise.in/) workshop and super excited.
Here are some extracts from the workshop blurb:

Though the longevity of human life has increased due to advances in medical technologies, our ‘Quality of Life’, especially in cities, has taken a direct hit as a result of environmental degradation. The food we eat is contaminated with chemicals, the air we breathe is polluted, the water we drink is becoming more scarce and more polluted, our lifestyles are becoming more sedentary, our consumerist tendencies are increasing the consumption of natural resources and generating more waste than natural processes can handle, our communities are disintegrating, lifestyle diseases are more prevalent, mental health issues are on the rise and injustices to politically and economically weaker communities is increasing. Competition is becoming more intense, starting in schools and spreading to all other spheres of life…..

….A possible way out of this is to take time to pause and think through some of fundamental aspects of our lives and the way we go about living it. This would include thinking about the kind of material and social needs and aspirations we have, and how we go about interacting with the environment, the organisms and people around us in trying to meet our needs. We have come to call this as ‘Ecologising’ ourselves. ‘Ecologising’ is an attempt to explore and understand the reasons behind the individual alienation, disgruntlement that one might experience as a part of our urban lives and also the causes for the larger Environmental and Social issues that are causing immense suffering to people and other life forms. As we evolve in our understanding, we hope to also respond by finding alternative ways of living learning and working towards a more personally meaningful and fulfilling life that is also less exploitative of nature and other people.
