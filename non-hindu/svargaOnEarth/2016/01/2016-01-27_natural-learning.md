Natural Learning

A friend recommended [Sangeetha Sriram’s blog](http://sangeethasriram.blogspot.in/) the other day and I have been avidly reading all of her posts on natural learning, which is an approximate synonym for unschooling and perhaps a more appropriate, positive one. She writes very thoughtfully and insightfully. This combined with our weekend with George and Sushila and their three intelligent, interested and interesting, thoughtful and kind unschooled girls has really swayed us in favour of unschooling/natural learning/self-directed learning or whatever you choose to call it.

Here – without further ado as I have just discovered Uppu and a friend have managed to spray a huge quantity of water all over the bathroom floor, doorframe, bedroom ceiling, walls, curtains and bed complete with duvet and pillows; possibly one of those rare situations where ‘no’ really is required – is a selection of my favourites:

alternative schools:

**What about ‘alternative schools’? Don’t they enable some sort of natural learning?**

Alternative schools today are the next best thing to regular schools that stress our children out and rob them of their dignity. There are schools that we know respect children for who they are, nurture their creativity and leave their dignity fairly intact. But we have a few issues with these schools as well.

*\* Ideals get diluted:*The moment we walk into any school, however radical their founders aspire to be, we see that they are forced to satisfy the demands of parents who want their children to fit into the society. This is where they begin to compromise on their ideals. I can understand this to a certain extent. I am part of a collective that runs an organic store. Though some of us running the store started it and still hold on to some high ideals, we end up compromising here and there to accommodate the needs of a variety of ‘customers’ who may not buy into them fully. And because we need a certain number of them to keep the store going, there ends up being a dilution of ideals at many levels. So, we end up choosing what we can’t afford to compromise on (our core values) over what we can. I guess that that is what many schools are forced to do.

*\* Children are pressured (however subtly) to do group activities*:
The moment we put one person in charge of a bunch of children, it becomes impossible to let each child do his/her own thing. Then, adults tend to structure their time to be better able to manage the herd. I find it insensitive to tell a child, ‘Enough of that, now let’s do this.’ It feels like distrusting their inner guidance. Young children’s learning process is biologically driven, just like a sapling’s growing process is. A sapling knows best which way to turn for sunlight, which way to send its roots for water and minerals, which minerals to absorb at what stage of its growth, etc. doesn’t it? Similarly, children’s bodies lead them to where they need to be, get them naturally interested in activities that are best suited to that phase of their development – physical, mental, spiritual, etc.

A child may want to spend a whole day in the water or the sand. We believe that there should never be ‘enough’ of any activity unless there is a danger lurking around or she needs to be some place else (or doing something else) for some real reasons. There is also a notion among alternative educators that ‘structured time’ disciplines the child and gets her ready to fit into the world better. We need to go deeper into asking ‘why so?’

*\* Priorities are already defined:*For older children, even alternative schools set the syllabus and decide what they need to be learning. Doesn’t ‘setting a syllabus’ mean deciding for each child what subjects / areas of life are more important than others? For instance, I always wonder why ‘English’ and ‘Maths’ are considered to be the core and essential subjects in all schools! Why not make painting and dancing core subjects? What makes them extra-curricular? And also, why not make Sanskrit or Tamil equally important languages for study along with English? We have such a wealth of essential life knowledge locked up in these scripts. Are we subtly, yet strongly, giving our children messages like ‘Your language (and hence your culture) is not as important as the English / American?’ and ‘Mental ability (solving math problems) is superior to physical ability (dancing) or creative ability (art)?’ Even ‘alternative schools’ produce far fewer artists than engineers and managers that drive our industrial system.

Materials (like those prepared by Maria Montessori) are definitely very useful for children (and adults like me!) to learn mathematical concepts in a fun way. But the question I’d ask even before that is, who defines that the child should learn specific mathematical concepts? One of the arguments is that ‘It is easiest to grasp certain concepts at certain ages’. As parents, we believe that when a child (or an adult) has a real need for a certain specific knowledge, then nothing can stop her from learning it. That is the nature of learning! Without exception. For instance, at the age of 23 when I wanted to become an economist (with absolutely no math background) I devoured workbooks on Calculus and Statistics and fared very well.At 27, when I got curious about the ‘History of Indian Agriculture’, nothing could stop me from reading books on history. While in school, my most hated subject was History! Also, before children turn seven is the time when they have the ability to effortlessly learn five to seven languages simultaneously. Why not allow the child to immerse in various language environments, rather than sit down and learn math concepts? On what basis do we adults decide what our children should learn? This is an open question that we need to really explore and dialogue over.

*\* Teachers are not necessarily seekers:*Children don’t learn what they are taught. They imbibe what they experience. If a teacher says ‘Be respectful’ a child might store that information in her head and use that ‘knowledge’ to write an essay on ‘respect’. But it will not help her to learn to be respectful. A child naturally learns ‘humility and respect’ by observing a teacher who is truly humble and respectful in her interactions with people, nature and things around her in her day-to-day living. No being is perfect. But I wonder how many teachers in these schools sincerely aspire in that direction!
