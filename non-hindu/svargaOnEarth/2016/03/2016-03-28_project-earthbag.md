Project Earthbag

one way to tamp an earthbag

We have about two months left before the rains start – and everything else stops – in Sakaleshpur and thus just enough time (on present, optimistic, forgetting this is India estimates) to build a large sun/rain shelter – or the lounge area for you, Tom – and another compost loo, this time Western style for all those who find our current Indian one a bit difficult to handle.

After a very drawn out and painful experience with regular masonry for our living essentials (loo, bathroom and outdoor wood-fired stove) last year, we know we don’t want to go down that route again and anyway we have always wanted to keep concrete to the bare minimum. So I started reading up on mud construction and it looks like that the easiest, most foolproof technique, with no requirement for skilled labour at all, is earthbags.

Armed with a folder of print outs, some saved YouTube videos, and lots of enthusiasm, we devoted this weekend to testing the soil and creating some experimental bag mixes. After the cigar, ball, biscuit, jar, shrink, ribbon and handwashing tests, we concluded that our soil either has too much clay, too little clay or just enough clay. Being optimists, we settled for the last one and are hoping our earth is going to need no stabilisers (adding anything means a lot more work and cement in particular can cause moisture issues). We did however try out some earthbag mixes, for fun if nothing else, with cow dung, lime, cement and straw and will check in a week’s time how strong they are once dry.

We were further encouraged by a visit to Paramesh’s house in Sullakki, our nearest village. His house is the oldest in the village, over 100 years, and was built of mud using the cob technique. They added nothing to the soil, but they did soak it in a pit with lots of water for a week before they started construction so we are also trying that.

making a mud-splat, or rather a mud-water mix for an earthbag

The house is really quite a marvel. Apart from a loft made of untreated jackfruit wood – jackfruit grows all over the place here – and a Mangalore tile roof, the entire structure from foundations upwards is nothing but earth. The earthen floor is smooth, level and much cleaner feeling than the expensive tile or marble flooring we are used to in the city; it also only needs cleaning – using diluted cow dung – once every ten days or so. The walls are plastered with an earth-sand mix, and painted over with lime. And according to the family, their house is cooler than the regular concrete variety in summer and warmer in the chilly monsoon months.

There are other mud structures in the village, but they are more recent and mainly used for cattle sheds, and not nearly so sound or smart-looking as Paramesh’s. Most probably the art of cob-building is dying out or has already died, no doubt because of the rise of Portland cement, bricks and masons. Nevertheless, the many neighbours and local friends we spoke to about our earthbag project were all interested. Quite apart from the fact that people are generally fascinated by what bizarre thing these half-firang Bangaloreans will do next, the idea that you can construct something yourself using your own resources (provided you have a bit of land you can dig up for earth) has a stong appeal. Masons, cement and sand (illegally sourced at night from the river) make any construction reasonably expensive and troublesome. So the onus is now on us to show that earthbag building really is easy and cheap, totally doable even by people as un-handy as ourselves, and that it produces structures as sound and pukka as concrete.

So here goes nothing. Any enthusiastic earthbag volunteers will be warmly welcomed, as will those who would like to come and lend their culinary skills, positive thoughts or mathematical genius (we spent the latter half of the weekend trying to remember how to calculate the circumference of a circle based on the radius; Gautam did dredge ‘2πr’ up from his memory on Sunday morning but we weren’t very sure and measuring a stainless steel plate seemed a safer bet).
