Bye Bye to Bras?

The Indian Homeschooling Conference, organised by [Swashikshan](http://homeschoolers.in/) and held this year just outside Bangalore, was fantastic: Hundreds of adults, teenagers and children from all over the place and all walks of life, speaking many different languages and practising many different forms of home education, from unschooling to nomadic learning (Gautam, with his love for the road, liked the sound of that a lot), a completely dynamic and happily chaotic schedule and almost entirely outside in an eco campus shaded by large chikoo and mango trees.

We returned thoroughly enriched with new ideas – the most revolutionary being that bras are no more necessary, or beneficial, than shoes (look at that statement from the barefoot movement perspective or you will be wondering what my point is) – and connections. Uppu returned exhausted after three days of mad play with a whole bevy of children from infancy to late teens.
