Foraging

Primrose and dandelion salad anyone?



Foraging – going out into the wild to find food – is you might think fairly niche. For most of us the walk to the supermarket is taxing enough, as evidenced by the popularity of grocery delivery sites, and anything that doesn’t come safely wrapped in plastic with a packaged on, used by and best before date is obviously not fit for human consumption.

Google ‘foraging course England’ though and you will find that foragingis now de rigeur. So much so in fact that there are now foraging hen parties and wild-food gourmet cooking classes. What better evidence of mainstream-dom?

It may be that the popularity of these courses also reflects a reluctance to get out there aloneand and gather a handful of delicious mushrooms for supper. Even things that were once staples of a British country upbringing – gathering blackberries, elderflower (for elderflower cordial), and conkers (for playground contests) – are foreign to many who have been in the city all their lives.And nettle soup or dandelion salad are either a bad memory from war-time rationing, or something served at a hippy commune, depending on your perspective, and age. Still, there are happily many books available for would-be foragers in the British Isles and I successfully made lunch with tender beech leaves and primroses, while happily avoiding the rhubarb leaves which a quick search showed to be poisonous to humans.

In India, though, it is a different story. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the art of foraging is still alive and well in the Indian village. We have eaten the most delicious breakfast made with some kind of sappu (leafy green) gathered from the jungles of the Western Ghats and people are used to gathering wild fruits such as jackfruit. It is not though by any stretch of the imagination trendy among urbanites as it is in the UK. And as a result I imagine there are no courses, workshops or books for the English-speaking middle classes who want to try their hand at it. There is also of course the added danger of not only ingesting something poisonous but also being bitten by something poisonous. For someone as Kannada-challenged as I, I suspect the only option I really have is to spend lots of time with people who know about which plants are safe and which aren’t, and watch them gathering, preparing and cooking them – descriptions alone being inherently dangerous when you get things like ‘havu’ and ‘hasu’ mixed up.

As an aside, a book on foraging introduced me to a new idea: There are two ways to meet your food – and indeed other, such as fuel, clothing etc – needs. One is the agriculturalist’s view: I would like to have carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers in a few months so I will plant the seeds on my patch of land, tend them and harvest them when ready. The other is the forager’s perspective: let me see what is already growing on my patch of land and how I can use that to meet my daily nutritional requirements. While we will definitely be starting our vegetable garden in Sakleshpur soon, I would love to explore the second way too and see what among the abundance of vegetation that is already there we can use.
