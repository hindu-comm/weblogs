Rainshine

![rainclouds](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/rainclouds.jpg?w=656)

It has been just over a year since we first camped here – yes we’re still in tents, and loving it – but we pretty much missed the 2015 Sakaleshpur monsoon, bara couple of wet weekends attempting to cook on an unsheltered fire with soaking wet firewood and lashings of diesel.
This time, we thought, we are sorted: a covered outdoor kitchen, two rainproof shipping containers, a proper loo (so no need for an umbrella which gets pretty awkward) and a bathroom with hot water to wash off all the mud. As it turns out the rain gets in everywhere apart from the loo: the front of the containers, the sides of the kitchen, the bathroom chimney; and as for the mud… Still nothing that large tarpaulins, stepping stones, wellies and creative thinking can’t fix and we have just got back from a dramatic, soggy, but immensely fun week planting hundreds of saplings and seeds between rainstorms and sunshine.

It has also turned out – contrary to expectations – to be a glorious time for foraging. We gorged ondeliciously ripe jackfruit and wild mangoes – small, tangy and very fibrous, to be eaten with the skin. We also discovered a range of mushrooms growing everywhere, and enjoyed different types of mushroom subji almost every day – initially warily (despite Mr Basavaraj assuring us ‘tind bodo, parva illa’, but with increasing confidence.
