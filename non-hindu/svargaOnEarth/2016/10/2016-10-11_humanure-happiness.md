Humanure Happiness

We opened the first vault of our compost loo this week to find a crumbly mound of rich, sweet smelling manure. And so safe to handle that I had no hesitation in asking Uppu and his friend help us distribute it among our new fruit tree saplings.

Thank you to all who have visited and contributed.

(the local river/open sewer near our flat in Fraser Town; if only smell could be conveyed through a blog post)

you have created a valuable resource:

We are now in the process of building a similar double vault dry compost loo but with a Western-style commode and, after much trial and error, we do consequently know more or less what works and what doesn’t. So if anyone is interesting in building one of these and wants some advice we’d be more than happy to help.

On a related note we (and perforce all guests – you have been warned) are switching over to biodegradable cleaning and cosmetic products:

- for shampoo we use a shikakai (soap nut) powder; no conditioner needed
  because it doesn’t dry out the hair like regular shampoo - for soap we have both a powder made of various herbs and also a more
  normal bar of soap made from natural oils - instead of tooth paste we have tooth powder made from charcoal and
  other natural cleaning agents - to wash dishes we use either ash from our fire or shikakai-based
  powders - and for general cleaning we use baking soda

Other suggestions – especially recipes for homemade equivalents – are welcome. The only non-biodegradable product we still use is liquid hand soap for washing hands. I’m on the lookout for a good solution to this – something which is as hygienic and sanitising as the no-contact dettol liquid soap dispensers.
