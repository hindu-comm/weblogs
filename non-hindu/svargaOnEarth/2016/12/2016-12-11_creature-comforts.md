Creature Comforts

We have been busy adding a few mod-cons to our jungle camp:

After repeated requests from city-slicker guests, we now have running water – well two Sadhana Forest style taps which you can fill from the water drum. The brilliant thing is that they actually help us conserve water because rather than sloshing several litres of water into the sink with the mug while washing hands or dishes, the tiny hole in the steel mug fixed on the wall dispenses a minimal, but adequate, amount of water for the task. (Sorry no photo, keep on forgetting to take one.) Back in the day – up until we fixed an irrigation pipe from our neighbour’s kere – when we used to bring water in jerry cans from a kilometre away we would get through perhaps one or two buckets (how many litres in a regular bucket – may 10 or 20?) a day for each sink. Now that we have 200-litre drums beside each, we find the drums often need refilling more than once a day. Anything available in abundance reduces in value.

Another source of angst was the lack of a fridge – mainly among mothers who wanted yogurt, paneer and milk (the morning’s supply of fresh milk from the cow often doesn’t last the hot afternoon), and fathers who wanted cold beer. After months of searching, I managed to find the [Mitticool](http://mitticool.com/product-category/refrigerator/) on sale in Bangalore – if anyone wants details, get in touch – and we now have one installed in the kitchen. The Mitticool is a simple box built of white clay (the most cooling type) with two compartments, above which you add ten litres of water. It is made in Gujarat and well publicised but difficult to actually get hold of. It doesn’t dispense ice for gin and tonics, but it does keep things cool if not cold and is also mouse-proof.

There hasn’t been much demand for cakes, chutneys, idlis and juices, but because we loved the concepts we decided to also get ourselves a couple of solar ovens and a bicycle blender. The solar ovens are fairly self explanatory – and thankfully now available on Amazon – and we have successfully used them for cooking essential items such as gingerbread men and mince pies.

Bullet and the Gingerbread Man

Definitely something I want to explore more but we will probably need something much bigger given that we often have lots of people staying, perhaps something like this that we saw at Protovillage:

The bicycle blender on the other hand was a project and a half. For those who haven’t guessed this is a stationary bicycle on the back of which is mounted a blender, or mixey in Indian-speak, which is powered by pedalling. We saw this at Sadhana Forest too and I immediately set about figuring out how to make one. I did watch a few YouTube videos but was soon lost among dynamos and rotating shafts. Gautam and a friend who knows about these things were going to do it one weekend but that never happened so eventually I traced a route from Tannery Road to Shivajinagar, via a couple of mixey repair shops, and found a wonderful man named Babu with all kinds of greasy machinery who said yes of course he could build it. And build it he did:

It takes its own time, but it definitely works. We need to now test it out with some different jars, and I wonder if it might be better to have a geared cycle to give it more power. We could also use the same concept to run other things such as a basic water pump or to charge a battery.

Other things on the to-do/wish-list of home improvements:

– a cob oven, mainly for the fun of building it I have to confess and for wood-fired pizza chef friends

– a more efficient and less smoky stove, perhaps a rocket stove which I keep hearing about

– a solar-powered water heater

– some way of keeping us warmer on cold winter nights in the container/tent, I’m thinking a yurt-style log-burning stove but that might not work in polyester tents…
