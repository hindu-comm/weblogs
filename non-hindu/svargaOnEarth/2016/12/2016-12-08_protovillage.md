Protovillage

There are no signs to [Protovillage](http://protovillage.org/), nothing to announce its presence among the barren scrub of this dry land. When Google maps informed us that we had reached our destination, we assumed it was time to ditch the smart phone and start asking directions the old way, until we noticed a wonderfully curved and sloping Mangalore tile roof atop a graceful ark-like earthen building and realised that we had indeed arrived.

Like the couple who set it up and run it, Kalyan and Shobita, this is a project which is all substance and no show. After quitting his city job at the age of 30, Kalyan spent several years travelling from village to village in India, living, eating and working alongside his hosts in each place, and then another four years here in Tekulodu, a village on the Andhra-Karnataka border, staying with different families, labouring with them (much to their amusement given his initial lack of skill) and understanding how they lived and particularly their financial health, or lack thereof. He then spent a year or so working with a farmer from the village who had been on the verge of selling up and trying his luck in Bangalore as he could barely make ends meet with an annual income of Rs 6,000. By the time Kalyan left, the farmer’s income was Rs 14,000 a month. And it was only at this point, and only because he realised that positive change cannot be sustained via individuals but requires institutions and systems, that Kalyan came up with the idea of setting up a model village which would re-create the community which had once made Indian villages strong and mainly self-sufficient units. After living and working with the villagers for so long, learning from them as much as he could and being careful not to preach his own ideas, he won something that few outsiders ever do: acceptance. Twelve families from the village now co-own and co-manage the ten-acre piece of land that comprises Protovillage.

Two years in, the clearest indicators of the project’s success come from the village: Six of the biggest farmers are now switching to organic methods after seeing the results, and rates, they bring. And the village has also come together as a community – rather than employing a contractor – to themselves build a block of toilets using alternative building methods under Protovillage’s guidance.

Indeed, if you are interested in alternative architecture and construction, Protovillage is like Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. There is everything here from a geo-desic dome, to earthbag structures, a bull-driven lime plaster grinding process, stabilised earth bricks, and solar power everywhere; as well as plenty of mistakes to learn from, which are happily pointed out and discussed. The stabilised earth bricks are being used to create what our guide Rishabh tells us is an REZ, a rural economic zone, where locals will make eco-friendly soap and biodegradable sanitary pads.

Rishabh – who showed us around with his older sister Trisha while we waited for their parents’ return – may not be Willy Wonka but nevertheless held us enthralled. ‘How old is he?’, whispered a friend as Rishabh launched into the description of a reciprocal frame roof. ‘I’m nine.’ smiled Rishabh. Kalyan’s family joined him in Tekulodu just about when Protovillage started, leaving regular schools, work and life in Bangalore. The children have been homeschooled since they moved here, involving themselves in whatever work is happening and studying with their parents, other community members and visitors. So comfortable are they now with their new lives, that they sleep in a long row in a tiny loft with a handful of other villagers who base themselves on the land and stay here with them whenever their parents have to travel to Bangalore, or further afield.

Protovillage has now got funding from Tata, allowing them to put up all of the structures that they need, including a community kitchen and dining area, with some hired labour as well as their own team. And as if all of this building – of things and people – wasn’t enough to keep them busy, the plan is now to start working with others to replicate this concept elsewhere. Stay tuned…
