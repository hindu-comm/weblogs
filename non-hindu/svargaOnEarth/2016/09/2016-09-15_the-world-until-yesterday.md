The World Until Yesterday

It would be fair to say that many of the books I read, some of which I subsequently write about here, are written by proselytising enthusiasts (of natural farming, unschooling etc etc) who have long been practising what they preach. [Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond) is quite different. For one, rather than being trending but obscure, he is a well respected household name. And secondly, he is a an independently minded researcher offering up his observations – in this case on hunter-gatherer societies – in a measured manner. Finally a book I can recommend to sceptical friends and family and that they will take seriously.

*[The World Until Yesterday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Until_Yesterday)* focuses on several aspects of hunter-gatherer societies that Diamond feels may be of interest, either as practices to be avoided or adopted. The aspect that interests me most is,surprise surprise, the one on children, and that is what I am going to write about here, but many of you might enjoy his chapters on things like dispute resolution, treatment of the elderly, health…

Diamond serves up the good, the bad and the ugly with the same studied objectivity. In one society where women are expected to labour and birth away from the community and unassisted, a Western anthropologist hears the cries of a woman in distress during childbirth – it is a breech presentation – and tries to go and help. He is asked not to interfere and told that her parents will go. Her parents are not there and in the end no one goes. Her cries become weaker and in the morning both she and the child are dead.

There is then no romanticising this way of life, a way of life which, as Diamond keeps reminding us, we humans led for most of our existence. So what can we learn from such communities? In keeping with the spirit of the book, I will list what seem to me the most important observations without commenting on them and let each reader decide whether these practices have any use in our modern existence:

1\. Hunter-gatherer childen wean on average at about three, mainly because of the lack of suitable infant food substitutes. In settled agricultural communities, though, children are weaned around two years thanks to the availability of cow and goat milk and soft cereal gruels. Birth intervals correspondingly fall too. Weaning when done gradually and upon the initiation of the child rather than the mother is accompanied by less tears.

2\. Breastfeeding is frequent and for a short duration. For instance a !Kung infant nurses about four times an hour for two minutes each time. This is termed continuous nursing – as found in chimpanzees – as opposed to the discontinuous nursing of say a lioness who suckles her cubs, then leaves them while she goes out to hunt. With the onset of schedule feeding, “modern human mothers have acquired the suckling habits of rabbits, while retaining the lactational physiology of chimpanzees and monkeys”. Continuous nursers tend to carry their children and be in constant contact with them (think of monkeys, kangaroos and bats) while they forage. Discontinuous nursers don’t (think of dogs and cats), instead staying with their young just long enough to feed and care for them and then going out. In no hunter-gatherer society surveyed did the mother and infant sleep in separate rooms.

3\. Baby-wearing is alive and well in hunter-gatherer communities, but they tend to use devices which allow the child to share the same world-view as the parent – ie: facing forwards.

4\. A child has not just two parents, but a whole community of parents – termed allo-parents – which anthropologists think explains their precocious social skills.

5\. Babies’ cries are responded to almost immediately. There is no ‘cry it out’ method in practice here.

6\. (Physical) punishment is rare among hunter-gatherers, but becomes much more prevalent among farming and herding communities. Diamond suspects this is because hunter-gatherers have little valuable property (whereas if a ‘misbehaving’ child in a herding community accidentally leaves the gate open it could lead to the loss of their family’s livestock wealth), but also because of the greater power differences, inequalities and insistence on deference and respect in the latter two groups.

7\. On a similar note, he finds that hunter-gatherers are “fiercely egalitarian, and that they don’t tell anyone, not even a child, to do anything”. So children enjoy much more autonomy (sometimes with the scars to prove it – many adults he met have injuries from playing near fire as children). Interestingly the degree of freedom a child enjoys seems to be directly connected to the environment they inhabit: those in the tropical rainforest are never left unattended (indeed often never put on the ground), whereas in places with less predators parents can be more relaxed about their charges.

8\. In a small community (30 is the average), there can be no segregation of children according to age and sex so all play together. This also means that children grow up looking after younger children and are thus well prepared for parenthood however early it comes. After initially being shocked to see a young girl he has watched grow up become a mother at 14, Diamond later realises “she was better qualified to become a parent than I had been when I became a father at age 49”. There is also much more open sex play among children, influenced too by the fact that with children sleeping with their parents in the same room, and often bed, they are often witness to their parents having sex (most parents don’t try to prevent them) and subsequently try to imitate this in their games with other children.

9\. There is no division between play and learning. “The kids play for fun, but their play serves the function of letting them practise things they will later have to do as adults.” For instance, they play at building a cattle stall or shooting an arrow at a target or weaving a mat. Their games lack competition or contests and instead often involve sharing. Toys are rare and are made either by the child’s parents or by the child themselves.

Diamond quotes Nurit Bird-David on India’s Nayaka people: “No formal instruction and memorizing here, no classes, no exams, no cultural sites \[schools\] in which packages of knowledge, abstracted from their context, are transmitted from one person to another. Knowledge is inseparable from life.”

And again from a study of Africa’s Mbuti Pygmies by Colin Turnbull: “For children, life is one long frolic interspersed with a healthy sprinkle of spankings and slappings…And one day they find that the games they have been playing are not games any longer, but the real thing, for they have become adults. The hunting is now real hunting; their tree climbing is in earnest search of inaccessible honey; their acrobatics on the swings are repeated almost daily, in other forms, in the pursuit of elusive game, or in avoiding the malicious forest buffalo It happens so gradually that they hardly notice the change at first, for even when they are proud and famous hunters their life is still full of fun and laughter.” This reminds me so much of Jean Liedloff’s observation that among the Yaquana tribe she studied, the idea of certain activities being work and others being play was completely foreign. There was no bracing oneself to work and then looking forward to relaxing afterwards. And I can’t resist but comment here that by contrast we not only divide our lives into (too much) work and (never enough) play, but also impose this upon our children by introducing them to the grind of school, homework and exams from an early age and thus making learning into work and something wholly separate from play.

Even the impartial Diamond, in his concluding remarks, notes that the differences in child rearing practices may account for the apparent “emotional security, self-confidence, curiosity and autonomy of members of small-scale societies, not only as adults but already as children”.
