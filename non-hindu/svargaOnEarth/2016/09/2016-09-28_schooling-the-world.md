Schooling The World

*Schooling The World* is not a nuanced documentary. It has a message to deliver and it does so loud and clear:

The modern Western education system was born of a need to create obedient, efficient workers for the industrial revolution (Seth Godin and Ken Robinson are both brilliant on this). Whether or not such a system could ever be useful for any society long-term, financial considerations aside, it is almost certainly neither appropriate nor desirable for many of the countries and communities to which it has spread or is spreading. The seemingly noble aim of many well intentioned international bodies, governments and individuals to get every child into school may instead be ripping apart societies which have long existed peacefully, happily and self-sufficiently. It was and is incredibly patronising – and characteristic of the Western attitude to the developing world, and I know because I was brought up with this outlook – to think that the centuries of child-rearing and education that have worked so successfully in these communities need to changed, need to be replaced with a system which is totally alien to them, robs them of their culture and sense of belonging, and prepares their children to become bit players in the global economy, leading monetarily-rich (relative to their parents’ income) but physically, culturally, emotionally and spiritually-poor lives in the gutter of some metropolis.

Carol Black sets her beautifully, and provocatively, shot documentary in Ladakh, as an example of how Western schooling is pulling apart the fabric of a traditional society. She doesn’t spare anyone, not least several of her interviewees – including a senior figure from the World Bank – who must now be cursing their participation, in seeking to show just how damaging this type of education is, and how misguided its proponents.

The documentary doesn’t try to show the other side of the story, but perhaps that is wise. Given how widely accepted is the notion that this type of education can only be of benefit, and that without it the ‘poor’ and ‘marginalised’ (in whose eyes?) will never be able to better their state, we need a polar-opposite perspective to at least restore balance in our thinking.

Yet the fact remains that in India Western-style, English-medium education is the holy grail for every struggling family, at least in the cities. Too many are already too cut off from their roots to return; the only option left to them is to work hard to climb one rung up the urban middle-class ladder. Once your parents have moved to the city to work in factories for peanuts, what choice do you have but to go to school, get the grades, learn at least some English and find yourself a white-collar job – even if it is taking bookings for couriers in an airless basement corridor. There is no turning back, and thus the English-medium private schools flourish, starting at 3, 2.5, 18 months or even six. Parents are happy to have got their money’s worth, content in the knowledge that their offspring will have a better life than them because already they can sing ‘The wheels on the bus go round and round’ and recite the English alphabet.

I am left reflecting on what all this means for us as a family, especially the idea that Western educational methods and establishments, and the urban consumerism and global economy they feed into and off, are killing diversity and heterogeneity.

Gautam’s parents and my parents are fairly well rooted in their own cultures and are subsequently worlds’ apart from each other. Gautam and I have many cultural differences, some of which enrichus(language, religion) and some of which challenge us(family expectations, social mores), but we have enough in common to make a life together. And by the time it comes to Uppu, there is little that sets him apartfrom hisplaymates in both India and England; he is part of the new age homogeneity of language, thought, culture, religion. He can fit in pretty much in any middle-class urban setting across the world, but he will never really have any roots, any place or culture that he belongs to wholly. As his parents, and if he so wishes, we can help him avoid mainstream education and try to create a hotch-potch of experience simulating the kind of childhood he really deserves, but there is no ‘gaon’ or ‘ooru’ for him to go back to. We have long ago lost our traditional ways of life and learning – although some are energetically trying to track them down – and our childhoods especially are all the poorer for it. Let’s hope the Ladakhi children don’t lose theirs.
