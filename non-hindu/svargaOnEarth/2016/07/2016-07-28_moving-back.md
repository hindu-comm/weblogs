Moving Back

If I were to announce that I was moving back, that yes I have been here many years and have adapted and made a life here, but that it’s getting harder and harder with a young child and ultimately I think we will be happier and more fulfilled there than here, most people would understand. They would understand because they would assume I meant moving back to England, where I’m from. That I had had enough of the chaos that is India and wanted to go home.

If, though, I clarified that it wasn’t England I wanted to go to, but to the farm or a farm, that it wasn’t India I’d had enough of but the city, any city, then people would react differently. They would think I was extreme, difficult, radical or just weird. They would not understand. They would not understand that the city feels like a foreign country I’ve grown weary of, that I want to go and live permanently in a place that feels like home – that has been home to humans for most of our species’ existence. For them, this city life is normal and natural. Gautam needs to have a career, to earn. Uppu needs to go to school, to study. This is real life. There is no other option. I am living in a dream world.

If I could find a good reason to do so, I’m sure I could re-acclimatise myself to the city. I could gradually re-build my tolerance of the noise, the dirt and the traffic. I could re-accustom myself to a life spent primarily indoors, sitting. I could adjust, but if Uppu couldn’t? If all that energy; that need to touch, feel, experiment, make a mess; that curiosity and love of company (human, animal, whatever) wasn’t able to find an outlet in this city life, if instead it vented itself in ‘undesirable’ behaviour, then what? Put him into school, just like everyone else. Into a classroom where he will sit for the next 15-20 years of his life, his energy and curiosity thwarted and quickly evaporating, so that he will then be well prepared (conditioned?) to join the mainstream economy and make a living.

I am reminded of what Jiddur Krishnamurthi said: “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly *sick society*.”

Have I become intolerant? Maybe. Or maybe my tolerances have just changed. I can do without electricity, but not sunlight. I can exist without the internet, but not meaningful activity. I can work in the midday heat, live in perpetual muddy dampness, but I cannot sleep in an air-conditioned room. I can handle the mosquitoes, the kambali hulus (literally ‘blankety caterpillars’), the snakes and even the leeches, but not the creepy crawlies of the city, lethargy, ill-health, loneliness.
