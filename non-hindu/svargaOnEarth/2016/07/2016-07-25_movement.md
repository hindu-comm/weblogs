Movement

Everyone in the fitness world is talking about movement these days. Mostly, though, it refers to a less conventional approach to exercise – over and under a cityscape as in [parkour](http://parkour.com/), or wilderness training as in [movnat](https://www.movnat.com/). [Katy Bowman](https://nutritiousmovement.com/), a biomechanist with a rather dauntingly vast knowledge of the body and movement, takes a much more radical approach. For her, movement is all about ensuring we get all of the loads that our bodies need to function. If that sounds technical – and she can get very technical – the basic idea is simple: if you don’t squat, hang, bend, sit, sleep and walk like humans have evolved to, you are going to have problems, and not just a weak knee or dodgy ankle but also things like the chronic constipation that 60 million Americans suffer from, orthodontic issues for children that don’t breastfeed enough and breast cancer (Katy talks about how bras prevent breasts from supporting themselves).

One hour of exercise a day plus 23 of sitting or lying down is not the solution. Instead – and this will appeal to other parents who, like me, find it difficult to fit in any kind of exercise but are on their feet, and on the move, most of the day – we need to be moving in every kind of way throughout the day and night. Night too, because as Katy explains we are designed to sleep on the ground and thus benefit from the demands that places on our body. She even argues that cardiovascular exercise is only a requirement when the heart is forced to do all of the work of pumping the blood around the body because the rest of the body is not moving enough. Hunter-gatherers – the inspiration behind her work – have never exercised in our sense of the word because they get enough movement just going about their daily tasks.

That doesn’t necessarily mean we need to return to the jungle (although I for one would jump at the opportunity, and Katy talks a lot about the huge benefits of being in a natural environment). Instead we can change the environments we already inhabit to help us progress towards more movement and better health. That means getting rid of our chairs, from the ergonomic office swivel one through to that super comfy sofa, and thus forcing ourselves to get up and down from sitting – or even better squatting – on the floor all day long, strengthening parts of our bodies that were underused. and chipping away at the bad posture that our chair addiction has created in almost all of us. It also means getting rid of our three foot tall sprung mattress mounted on a high bed, and the double pillows to boot. If you’re worried about the house looking empty, you could always throw in some indoor monkey bars and rings to encourage you to brachiate (swing by your arms).

While we as a family haven’t (yet) got the monkey bars, we have implemented Katy’s no-furniture idea – partly out of choice (Venetia, readily), and partly because we had to leave our other flat fully furnished (Gautam, reluctantly). It does present some problems when guests come – even our househelp asked me when the furniture was arriving – but nothing that is unsurmountable and anyway I’m sure visitors appreciate the chance to see if they can get up from sitting on the ground without using their hands. For those who can’t it is a massive red flag for their overall health according to Katy.

That leaves us with being barefoot, squatting (preferably to eliminate as well as to garden, talk to children or animals, watch tv, smoke beedis etc etc) and walking. Walking is the one thing among all of this where those in the West have an advantage. In India, sitting and sleeping on the floor, squatting and being barefoot are still very common, even in cosmopolitan city life. Walking as a means to an end on the other hand is almost non existent except among those who can’t afford any form of transport. It’s too hot and too dusty, or too wet, there’s too much traffic and no pavement; but mainly it’s just too easy not to walk – everyone has a bike or a car, there are autos and Ubers, someone you can send, and now Flipkart and Amazon as well as the kirana delivery boy. There is of course walking as exercise, among the well heeled in nice green neighbourhoods in the mornings and evenings, but almost no one I know walks to go about their daily tasks. That aside, Katy doesn’t just talk about walking more, but also walking in the right way which is something most of us need to learn – and which she facilitates with detailed exercises. Walking, she says, is not optional; “it is a biological imperative, like eating and having sex”. And really we need to be walking not on smooth, level surfaces – ie: the floors and roads of the cities we live in – but on nature’s infinitely variable surfaces with gradient, texture, holes, creepy crawlies….in order for all 33 joints of the foot, and all of the other joints that are impacted, to be developed and maintained.

If you are wondering why anyone would surrender the necessary comforts of civilised life and embarrass themselves with attempts to squat and hang just to become more flexible (surely a yoga class would do the trick), you are missing the point. Katy’s ground-breaking argument is that the much under-studied science of movement provides a large part of the puzzle as to why we modern, civilised human beings are simultaneously the most advanced of all of earth’s inhabitants ever and also the sickest.

Despite raving to most people we know about primal posture and [Esther Gokhale](http://gokhalemethod.com/), I don’t think I’ve yet blogged about it here. Her theory – that back pain and other related issues are mainly due to the bad posture we have adopted, and that by re-training ourselves to sit, sleep, bend, stand and walk in the way humans are intended to we can solve it – immediately rang true for us because the evidence is right in front of our eyes. People – and especially women – here bend from the hips with straight backs.

(oh dear, where did Uppu learn that bad posture from…)

They comfortably carry loads on their heads. They can sit cross-legged for hours quite comfortably. And they do it all every day without any problem. Esther Gokhale’s book, *Eight Steps to a Pain Free Back*, has a huge amount of photos from all around the world attesting to the fact that this type of posture is common to many if not all traditional societies.

There are a few places that these two path-breaking ladies diverge on – pillows for instance and being barefoot; I am with Katy on both – but for the most part their research and teaching complement each other because ultimately the message is the same: we need to look back (or sideways) to how we as a species are intended to function to solve our present health issues.
