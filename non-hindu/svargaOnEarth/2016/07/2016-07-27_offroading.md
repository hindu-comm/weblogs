Offroading

![DSC_1205](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/dsc_1205.jpg?w=656)

I was for the first time ever alone at the farm this week. Well, alone in that there were no other human adults. I had Uppu, and I also had Bullet and KTM, the two rescue dogs that we recently adopted, a completely mad Labrador (yes that’s a lab not an otter in the photo), and a rather regal Mudhol Hound. (Gautam, who never does thing by halves, actually brought three back from Karuna Rescue Centre, but thankfully we found a good home for the 45 day year old rottweiler puppy leaving us with just these two. As an aside, having dogs in India for the first time made me realise just how terrified people are of them– we had neighbours in a screaming panic when we let the dogs out for a five minute run down the street – and how dog-unfriendly Bangalore is.
The only park dogs are allowed into is Cubbon Park, they are I think banned on public transport and are generallyunwelcome everywhere you go. There is nowhere for them to relieve themselves – and owners, or rather their dog-walkers, never clear up – and almost nowhere they can be let off their leads.) And at times Robbie, Bharath’s jackfruit-loving Doberman puppy also joined the party. So there wasn’t much time to feel scared or lonely and it also gave us the opportunity to spend more time with our Sullakki neighbours.

Friday night was proof enough if proof were needed that we are very fortunate to live in such a village. I was returning from a marathon 12-hour, 200-plus km trip to get various seeds and saplings from nurseries and a friend, Sriharsha. It was almost 9 and had been raining all day when we turned onto the track that leads to Sullakki, and I was just congratulating myself on being able to handle Gautam’s giant SUV for the entire journey when we slipped off the road and into a ditch. I tried – with Gautam on speaker directing me – all of the special 4WD levers and switches to no avail and was ready to abandon the car and walk home, in the raining darkness with no torch, but trusty Bharath turned up, organised his friend with a pickup truck, and on the third go they got us out of the ditch and on our way.

As a postscript, Gautam, riding to see us the next morning on his old Bullet, had the first of several mud falls in almost exactly the same spot; but he managed to haul the bike out of the ditch by himself.

Gautam’s arrival; it took him half an hour to cover the last 1.5kms
