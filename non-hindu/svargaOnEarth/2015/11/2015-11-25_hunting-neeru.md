Hunting Neeru

For those of you non-Kannada speakers who are wondering whether we have abandoned our vegetarianism in favour of big game hunting, neeru is water not some kind of Indian wildebeest. Nevertheless, the hunt for it is almost as exciting.

Water, as anyone who isn’t connected to the mains supply will tell you, comes top of your survival to do list. Despite now living in something approaching the lap of luxury with our compost loo, local style bathroom and outdoor cooking area, we are really struggling with water. Every weekend when we arrive, we fill up jerry cans and drums from the nearest house (luckily a friend’s) and slosh them down in Gautam’s four-wheel drive to the containers where we then disburse them into various buckets and containers as well as a water filter for drinking. All rather hard work. And as the dry season approaches, we will soon need water for the nine acres of coffee. Not something that a few jerry cans can hope to tackle.

And while we do hope to start rainwater harvesting – using a basic gutter plus filter plus tank something like this that I saw recently at Navadarshanam – from the roofs of our containers and other structures, the areas are small and the rains are now almost at an end. I hope also to find out more about swales, one of the permaculture buzz words I keep coming across, which are designed to conserve (and store?) water on the surface of the land itself. Again, though, that doesn’t provide a solution to our immediate problem of not having water to brush our teeth.

We had long planned to build a kere, an irrigation pond which is essentially just a massive hole in the ground that fills up with rather muddy water and needs intermittent cleaning. But that is not possible until March when the land is dried out. Someone suggested a borewell in the meantime, and to give us cleaner water for domestic use. So on Sunday began the neeru hunt, led initially by a local water diviner and then after that by a government hydro-geologist.

The water diviner used a plethora of home-made tools – an egg (I think) hanging on a chain, various metal contraptions, the classic fork made out of a twig from a nearby tree, and his watch – to find water. He gave us exact details for both – how far we would need to drill, where the rock starts, how much water it will give (8,000 gallons for the second one, and that’s per hour not in total as we were naively thinking) – based solely on this method.

The hydro-geologist, a charming old man who had travelled all the way from Bangalore, did a survey of the land showing where the water channels were, the direction the water was travelling in, where bands of rock stopped them and so on. He then chose two spots and used a complex electronic machine, taking readings at various points along the ground away from the site to see how far down the water was at both.

Interestingly both men selected spots on the same two channels of water (we did not show the hydro-geologist where the water diviner had chosen his sites) but at a distance from each other.

The good news is that it looks like we have plenty of water. We need dig only one borewell and that should suffice for all domestic and irrigation purposes. No keres required at all. So straight onto our natural swimming pool instead then….
