Variations on A Yurt

We found another yurt this weekend. Well a sort of yurt – a large round cob/adobe (does anyone know the difference or are they interchangeable terms?) hut with a yurt skeletal structure made of bamboo poles. The entire thing was made with locally sourced materials and no skilled labour – read about the construction [here](http://permaculturenews.org/2013/12/06/creating-bamboo-mud-yurt-art-living-permaculture-centre-bangalore-india/).
Although this yurt also has a dome on the top, it’s not open or transparent so doesn’t let in natural light. Perhaps that wasn’t important for this particular yurt, as it has several permanently open windows and a large doorway, so is light enough in day time; or perhaps it’s difficult to create a sky-window using these types of materials.

The yurt is on a seven acre piece of wasteland owned by the massive – by which I mean larger than many small towns – Art of Living ashram just outside Bangalore which was converted into a permaculture site a couple of years ago. The soft-spoken Manoj Kumar showed us how, using only natural techniques (including jivamrtam – below), the barren rocky land has become a source of plenty. We saw bhindi, beans, an enormous loki, bananas, tall grasses for cow fodder, papaya, an Indian cherry tree, all kinds of greens, cherry tomatoes growing wild and much more – all tended by a team of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar devotees, including some volunteers from Brazil.

We are still not too clear on what permaculture entails but are hoping to attend a course soon (possibly [this one](http://panchabhuta.org/) which looks really good) and/or get on hands on a suitable book to understand more about it and see how we could apply it to the farm in Sakaleshpur.
