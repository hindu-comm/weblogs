It’s Official

After one false start and a long, long wait, we yesterday became the proud owners – custodians? – of a nine acre coffee plantation just outside Sakaleshpura. The neighbouring six acres of jungle and kharab land (grazing pasture) where we pitch our tents is due to be registered next year.

The land is in the area between Balupet and Sakaleshpura, where the huge Hemavati river flows amid a series of gentle valleys and wooded crests.
There is no problem with elephants where we are – although towards Balupet elephants are a big issue – and amazingly almost no leeches even at the height of the rains. Snakes, yes – we’ve even seen a baby cobra – but no more than elsewhere and we arequite ok with them now.
Rainfall here is about 80-100 inches a year which is perfect for growing things – not just coffee, but also all kinds of fruit trees. What really decided us though was the – rather English in fact – beautiful grassy meadow looking out east towards a valley. No better spot to camp, and ideal for children: great swathes of flat or gently sloping grass, with almost nowhere for predators to lurk and enough visibility for attentive parents to keep a watchful eye from a comfortable chair, for playing ball games, flying kites, cycling, being planes, chasing dogs, turtles, crows, cows.

So this is it.

In fact, work is already well underway – despite having burnt our fingers once already by starting too soon. Mr Basavaraj and the daily labourers he employs have already weeded the coffee once – a massive task – and trimmed the deedoff trees that provide shade, and are now onto their second round. A JCB has cleared the old mud track road through the estate, and subsequent rain, cranes, trucks and tractors have turned it into a virtually impassable quagmire.

And we have our two containers on site and on their respective platforms, and our compost loo, bucket bathroom and wood-fired stove are all in the process of being built.

Full credit for the container living area has to go to our very own Sher of Sakaleshpura, Ashish, who has been living in a [rented village house](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2015/07/16/village-living/) at the foot of the farm for the last month and a bit and patiently dealing with stuck vehicles, more stuck vehicles and tractors doing wheelies, a disappearing mason, communication gaps, overquoting and a lot of rain and mud in order to get the work done. Yes, we have learnt our lesson – don’t attempt anything during the monsoon in the Western Ghats…

Next up, how to apply natural farming techniques to a test area of two acres.We don’t have the resources and infrastructure – cows, a cowshed, someone to look after them, jivamrta brewing and spraying structures etc – right now to start off with natural farming on the whole nine acres, and we also feel we should work out what we’re doing first on a smaller area. So we plan to let Mr Basavaraj do what he normally does on the seven acres which are already heavily planted with coffee – but with minimal use of chemicals and other practices we feel might damage the land – and get ourselves set up for our two acre experimental site over the next six to ten months.
