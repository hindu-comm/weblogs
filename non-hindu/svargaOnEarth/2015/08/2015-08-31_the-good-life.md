The Good Life

I was recently lent a book, *[Leading the Good Life: How to Live Sanely and Simply in a Troubled World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-Good-Life-Helen-Nearing/dp/0883652366)*, by [Helen and Scott Nearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Nearing). The authors leave New York and set themselves up on an old farm in Vermont, where the weather is so inclement they sometimes have frosts every month of the year. Nevertheless, they, and their short- and long-term visitors, manage to subsist on a diet formed principally of fresh fruit and vegetables for twenty odd years and to establish a livelihood which sustains and nourishes them physically as well as mentally and spiritually. They do not believe in profit-making and try to avoid hiring wage labour altogether, instead preferring to trade time and effort or to work as partners on a project and share the profits. Over the course of many years, they build houses and outbuildings of stone with their own hands and using stones they have themselves collected.
They look to the natural process of soil-building and soil-maintenance in the forest as they set up their extensive food garden, believing that whole food can only come from whole soil.

What makes this book particularly interesting is that it describes events of almost a century ago. The Nearings left New York for Vermont in the dark Depression years of the early 1930s. Perhaps they were way ahead of their time – they do describe the conservative Vermont shock at their vegan diet – or perhaps these ideas have been popular for much longer than we imagine. At any rate, the book is well worth reading particularly for its views on food production and consumption.

The authors discuss the importance of growing foods on soil which is balanced with all the right nutrients. They describe in detail what the milling and bleaching of grain – which produces the white flour that has become a staple for most of our baking needs – does to the nutrient quality of that grain, and why companies do it. Indeed they classify such processed foods and the chemicals used to preserve them as poisons. And they describe in detail their own daily diet and the logic behind it.

At a time when those who want to investigate alternative nutrition as a route to good health are flooded with very different food philosophies – vegetarianism, veganism, paleo, GAPS, raw food – the Nearings’ down-to-earth approach has a solidness about it which suggests it will stand the test of time. They practice veganism partly because they want to do as little harm as possible, and partly because they believe the milk of other animals is intended for those animals’ young and thus not suited for human consumption. More importantly, though, they believe in eating food as fresh and unprocessed as possible. For them that means fruit for breakfast. Vegetable soup with grain – unmilled and prepared only by baking or boiling – for lunch. And for supper, a salad of raw vegetables and fruit. They find ingenious ways to store vegetables and fruit without fridges and freezers so as to be able to eat fresh, as well as preserved, produce all year round. They eat in wooden bowls with wooden chopsticks, partly to avoid metal interfering with taste and partly to save on the washing up (after a week in England where the average meal might well require two to three plates or bowls, several rounds of cutlery and one or two glasses per person, plus the saucepans and serving dishes, I am reminded of why I likethe Indian practice of having one stainless steel plate with optional spoon so much). And they enjoy such a good level of health that they never have to see a doctor for 20 years. For me at least, that is the ultimate proof.

Interestingly the Wikipedia entry on Helen Nearing says she was at one point involved with [J Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti), the man who set up several very popular alternative schools in India.
