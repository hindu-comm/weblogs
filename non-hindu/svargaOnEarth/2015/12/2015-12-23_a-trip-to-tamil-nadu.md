A Trip to Tamil Nadu

![DSC_0087.JPG](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dsc_00871.jpg?w=656)

The two things that tie most of us to the city are work and school. And while those who are really determined to quit urban life can somehow manage the work side – either by a kind of work from home equation, or by resigning from their jobs, cutting all costs and living off the land – school is more difficult. Rural schools in India don’t have the best reputation and many, I imagine, use old-style disciplinary methods. Boarding school – or sending your children to live with relatives in the city – is an option. There are some great alternative boarding schools such as the Krishnamurti establishments and Centre For Learning (CFL). They are though over-subscribed and may not suit many families who want their children to be nearer to, or at, home.

The only other option is some kind of home-schooling, whether a formal syllabus-based learning programme managed and taught by the parent(s), or the self-directed learning known as unschooling. In a country where millions of children have no access to formal education, where teenagers routinely commit suicide because they got 96 instead of 97 % in maths, where after-school tuitions and exams dominate every middle class child’s life and where English-medium education is the surest route to financial and social upliftment, not sending your children to school is almost heretical. And not putting your children through any kind of formal teaching programme is all but unheard of. Unschoolers are pretty hard to find here.

Hema and Dev Jain are the first couple I have met in India who have taken the no-school approach in the rural context. They quit life in Silicon Valley, bought some barren land in Tamil Nadu in a beautiful spot surrounded by hills and are now trying to coax it into bloom. Their no-school journey started even before they left the States. Hema says that they watched their eldest child, Abhi who is now 12, turn into an unhappy child at school. He went first to a Waldorf kindergarten and then a liberal school. And while the parents felt the schools were both great places, and very much in line with their parenting philosophy, somehow Abhi was withering there. He would ask his mother why she was sending him away to learn and Hema says she had no answer to that. Finally they took the plunge, pulled him out of school and let him learn in his own way at home. The children – the younger one, Apu, is nine – fill their days with everything from chicken rearing to creating incredibly detailed miniature dolls’ house furniture (eg: a 2cm high pressure cooker with a weight and a ring to secure the handle) to solving maths problems and learning to sing.

It is though lonely to be the only ones in your extended family, and the locality you live in, doing this. The village children are most of the time too busy with school, tuitions and tv to be able to play. And while Hema and Dev do get like-minded visitors, they tend to just be passing through. At one point, another family with twins and with a similar approach to child-rearing and education came to live with them but they had to move back to the city due to complications with the grandparents.

Although it would be nice to have more of a community, both Hema and Dev feel that you have to be self-sufficient. And that as long as you don’t feel a lack, the children won’t either. It helps that Dev also no longer works so is fully available to the children. Still, I can’t but help think of that old maxim that it takes a village to raise a child and I wonder if the kind of small close-knit intentional communities which unschoolers, Continuum Concept-ers, back-to-the-landers and so on are creating in the West are also possible – or already in progress? – here. I’m thinking a joint family set up minus the family….
