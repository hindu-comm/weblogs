Dumbing Us Down

It is not often that a mother travelling alone with a toddler gets a chance to read. I’ve done two seven-hour train journies over three days with Uppu and barely managed to get through a sentence. Returning from London after Christmas, though, circumstances conspired to allow me to read not just a page but an entire book – [John Taylor Gatto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto)‘s [*Dumbing Us Down*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbing_Us_Down)

And quite a book it is. Gatto was named New York State Teacher of The Year in 1991 and chose to accept this honour with a speech that attacked the education system he worked for from all angles. In the speech – which forms one of the essay-chapters of the short book – he lists, in thundery rhetoric, the lessons he has really been teaching children. These start with ‘confusion’,

“Everything I teach is out of context. I teach the un-relating of everything. I teach dis-connections. I teach too much…”

and include ‘indifference’,

“I \[teach indifference\] by demanding that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor…But when the bell rings I insist they drop whatever it is we have been doing and proceed quickly to the next work station. They must turn on and off like a light switch.”

and intellectual dependency:

“Good students wait for a teacher to tell them what to do….Curiosity has no important place in my work, only conformity.”

Gatto is strongly convinced of the need for community – quite separate from the kind of faux communities or networks he feels most modern city dwellers belong to – and for children to grow up playing an active role in that community. As he points out, by sequestering both the old and young of our society and preventing them from being part of our day-to-day lives we are destroying the family unit upon which the community is founded and through which children learn, thereby ensuring they “cannot grow up fully human”. He also attacks television. Between school, homework and tv there is no time for children to spend time either with their families or with themselves, and that, he says, is what is causing all kind of childhood pathologies from lack of concentration to cruelty.

Although at times repetitive and extreme, as rhetoric tends to be, the points the former teacher makes are powerful and convincing. He doesn’t offer any detailed alternatives to mainstream compulsory schooling but suggests that private schools, homeschooling and other grassroots initiatives might provide an answer. The book’s blurb says he is or was working with an alternative school called the Albany Free School but I can’t see anything about that collaboration online and Gatto seems to have taken a back seat from public life since a stroke. *Dumbing Us Down* though is definitely worth a read and he has a couple of other books which would be worth investigating.
