Bhumi Puja

![IMG_5649.jpg](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/img_5649.jpg?w=656)Last weekend, we asked for Ganesh’s blessings on our newly acquired land with a bhumi puja ceremony (a kind of house warming party for land minus the champagne and cocktail sausages). In addition to our partners Bhagath and Saakshee – who live in Kuala Lumpa – visiting the place for the first time with their parents, we were also welcoming our cow.

Jaini and her calf Lola arrived about ten days ago and have already contributed milk, ghee (though unforunately not directly via the udder as my brother Tom was hoping) and urine for the puja – that was one of the items on the priest’s shopping list. Their main job will be to produce lots of dung so that we can make jivamrta and thus start on the Palekar method properly. We had thought we were getting a pure Malenad Gidda, the local desi cow which gives almost no milk but excellent dung and is incredibly hardy, but Bhagath’s father pointed out during the puja that Jaini has definitely got some hybrid blood in her. Another example of our poor Kannada communication skills leading to a mix up I guess but still we are thrilled to have a cow on board, and did an appropriate cow puja to mark her arrival.

A great end to a great year. Thanks to everyone who has made this possible: Mr Basavaraj, Bharath and the team on the land; Ashish who made the container site happen over several wet months; all our friends and visitors for the beautiful camping weekends; and all those who have inspired, advised and guided us as we blindly feel our way in this new venture.
