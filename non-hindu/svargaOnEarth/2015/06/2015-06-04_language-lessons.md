Language Lessons

Our Kannada has improved immensely – admittedly from a fairly basic level – since we started going to Sakleshpur every weekend. Some people speak a bit of English, or a bit of Hindi, but most of the time it’s Kannada and we have had no choice but to rapidly progress in comprehension and expression.

A conversation last weekend with Mr Basavaraj, a Kannada writer who has spent decades managing coffee estates and has graciously agreed to help us manage ours in his twilight years, made me realise I need to brush up on my vocabulary:

Me: ninne naanu ondu hasu nodide. (Yesterday I saw a cow.)

Mr Basavaraj: howda? (Really?)

Me: howdu. doddu hasu. tumba doddu. (Yes. A big cow. A very big cow.)

Mr Basavaraj: yelli ittu? (Where was it?)

Me: alli. tents pakka dalli. (Right there. Next to the tents.)

Mr Basavaraj: howdu. (Oh really.)

Me: nanna bhaya ittu. (I was scared.)

Mr Basavaraj: howda? yenu breed ittu? (Really? Which breed was it?)

Me: breed? hasu ittu….oh no, hasu illa havu. havu havu ittu. (Breed?
It was a cow….oh no, not a cow a snake. It was a snake, a snake.)

Given that we camp on an open meadow which is a grazing ground for many local cows, Mr Basavaraj’s polite patience with this mad English woman is indeed to be admired.

And yes, this was the first snake we have seen here (funnily enough the third I saw in a week; the first two were in Koramangala – perhaps that’s an omen of some kind), but most probably a rat snake. Generally the smaller the snake the more dangerous it is. Somehow I feel much less terrified of snakes than I used to; leeches seem to have displaced them in the hierarchy of phobias.
