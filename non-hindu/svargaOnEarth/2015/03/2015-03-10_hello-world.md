The Story So Far

A quick summary of all that has happened before this blog started:

After several days of scouting for neglected coffee plantations (the fully functioning ones being out of our budget – 12 to 20 lakhs an acre) in Sakleshpur, we zeroed in on a 12 acre stretch of land in Donigal, at the mouth of Shiradi Ghat road. With a river running right through, the railway bordering it on one side, and coffee-covered hills all around it ticks all the boxes for romance. And with the highway just 1.5 km away (but thankfully 1.5km of dirt track – private coffee estate roads – so no traffic) and Sakleshpur town only 6.5km distance, the location is perfect given that we are not intending to move here full time yet and can get here from Bangalore in three to four hours.

One major issue is that the owner had already agreed to lease eight acres of the land to commercial ginger growers. When we first saw the land, about five acres had been cleared and the lovely jungle trees still stood. Every time we came back, the JCBs and Hitachi bulldozers had cleared more of the bush and the workers were cutting down trees and burning the stumps, lending a wasteland look to the place. After endless discussions with various experts and friends, and a meeting with the ginger growers, they are going to go ahead with the planting as it is now too late for them to find and clear another stretch of land, but we are doing so with slightly heavy hearts as they will be using fertilisers and possibly also pesticides. On the up-side they will also plant coffee for us – and we can choose which type of coffee we give them to plant – and within a year they will harvest the ginger crop and move out. We can then start work on our plans, and reverse any damage to the soil that may have happened.
