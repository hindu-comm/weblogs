Sakleshpura Snow

Well not actual snow – how I miss that – but the delicate, pure white shock of flowers on the dark green coffee bushes do look rather like those dollops of snow, and equally short-lived, that Christmas card illustrators liberally sprinkle upon their Christmas tree branches.

The blossoming coffee smells rather like jasmine, and not at all like coffee, and the scent is all pervasive. There is a new film, *Coffee Bloom*, set in Coorg where love bursts into flower along with the coffee. Here’s the [Hindu article](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/love-in-coorg/article6964248.ece) on it. It is easy to see how this time of year, with the flowers, the aroma and the violent but quick thunderstorms (we had half an inch of rain in about half an hour on Saturday night, all credit to Quechua for keeping us completely dry), can capture your imagination.
