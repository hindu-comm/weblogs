The Legal Aspect

Buying agricultural land, at least in Karnataka, requires what is called agricultural khata – a document that shows that you or someone in your family owns land. You also need to show that you don’t earn more than two lakhs a year from non-agricultural sources. Land which is classified as plantation though has no such restrictions and is thus much easier to buy and develop. Sakleshpur, Coorg, Ooty, Chikmagalur and other hill stations have lots of plantation land (whether or not it is actually currently being used for plantation crops is not important; it just has to be classified as such in the documentation) but prices are rising fast as resorts and home stays spring up, and city buyers like us come in.

Vinod, an extremely helpful farming enthusiast with plenty of experience, gave us this list of documents that you must ensure you are given before you even consider buying a piece of land:

1\. Mother deed/ancestral deed/parent deed

2\. Latest tax paid receipt

3\. Encumbrance certificate (you need to get the 30 year one, not 13 year)

4\. Patta/kissa book

5\. Family tree (if the owner is Muslim or belongs to an SSC then purchasing his land could be extremely problematic as other family members may have a claim to it)

6\. Mutation extract

7\. No tenancy certificate. In our case the land is being leased to the ginger growers so obviously we don’t have this document; our lawyer says that the no tenancy certificate is more important for agricultural land and the owner has also said that he will stand guarantor that the ginger growers will vacate at the end of the contract. Ideally though you would not want anyone leasing the land because tenants have more right than owners in the eyes of the law, especially when the tenants rely on the earnings from the land to sustain themselves whereas the owners have cushy city jobs.

8\. Survey sketch

9\. No due certificate from the bank

10\. RTC extract

11\. Land holding certificate

12\. Sale deed

Land is split up into different units based on survey number. If a piece of land that was within one survey number is sold partially or sold to different parties, then that survey number is split, for example what was survey number 72 now becomes survey number 72/1 and 72/2. As part of the sale process, you need to get a fresh survey done to ensure that the land that is being shown to you on the map and at the site match, and that the acreage is accurate. Often neighbours may have encroached as well, so you need to know the boundaries and then enforce them with a fence of some sort. The surveyors that came to do our survey did a wonderful job of marrying traditional practices to modern technology: they used a 33 yard chain with pegs to measure the boundaries of the site but also had a GPS, and they are currently finalising the survey back in the office using Google maps.
