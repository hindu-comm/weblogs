The First Night

So far, we have tended to stay in the extremely friendly and cheap but not exactly clean and certainly not scenic Hotel Ashrita every time we have come to Sakleshpur for the various meetings, negotiations, inspections, surveys and so on that are an integral part of land purchase in India. This weekend we kitted ourselves out with tents, sleeping bags and a foldable bucket and spent our first night on the land.

The two man pop up tent (so effective at popping up that when it flew off the roofrack on the national highway it landed in the middle of the road and popped up ready for its next inhabitant) did just what it said on the packet, but the family tent which takes about two minutes to put up on the YouTube video had three adults plus one toddler struggling for the best part of an hour. Tent pegs and freshly ploughed crumbly earth are not a happy combination – even after Gautam tried using the Pajero Sport to pack the soil – and we had to use clods of earth and stones, and the odd tree branch, to get the tent upright and steady. After rushing off for a long meeting with the owner, and then a trip into Sakleshpur for lunch and to find out about a soil test, we returned at the end of a rain shower – this is apparently the blooming rain, light rain around the coffee blooming season – to find wet tents as we’d somehow managed to leave the doors open… Lesson learnt.

We had a beautiful night though watching the almost full moon rise above the trees, eating peanuts and mini-samosas (didn’t attempt to cook on our maiden camping trip). No wild animals encountered thankfully – although one of the workers told us the next day that elephants had been sighted at that spot two months ago – and only the trains and a typically Bangalorean thunderstorm (all thunder and lightning, followed by pitter-patter rain) to disturb our sleep. What a feeling it was to wake up next to a burbling river to the sound of peacocks, and to know that we are sleeping on land which we will soon – if all goes well – be sowing.

For newbie campers like us, here’s a list of essentials which occurred to us *after* we got there:

– fire starter (we brought a litre of petrol – not very eco – but never got the fire started because the kindling was damp; also planning to dig a fire pit next time)

– trowl or spade for digging a trench round your tent so the water can run off if it rains

– loo tent, necessary if you have more than about five people (you can buy these or you could just construct a shelter with stakes and coconut leaves; for both you need to then dig a pit and keep a bucket full of sand/earth next to it for people to pour in)

– shower tent (not essential but nice to have) which could again be a makeshift coconcut leaf job with just a bucket and a cup, or if you wanted warm water you can get these solar showers that heat up in the sun

– a bucket and cup for washing hands

– some kind of seating arrangement: mats, stones, logs, camping stools

– rubbish bin

– large water container with a tap so you’re not using endless plastic bottles

– torches and solar lamps

– hammer or stone for the tent pegs

And that’s not including cooking equipment…
