Natural Farming: CG Harshavardhan

A year or so ago, I went to an all girls book club. I mentioned that I was hoping to get into terrace gardening whereupon a friend of a friend lent me a copy of her book [*The One Straw Revolution* by Masanobu Fukuoka](http://www.onestrawrevolution.net/One_Straw_Revolution/One-Straw_Revolution.html). It’s not about terrace gardening at all but is the farming equivalent perhaps of *Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, with a similar cult status. Read it, it is quite sublime.

Natural farming is premised on the observation that plants and trees grow incredibly well in the forest with absolutely no intervention. They are not subject to disease and produce fruit in abundance. On the other hand, modern farming methods require increasing amounts of intervention – ie: hard, expensive labour – and pricey chemicals, and yields keep falling as the soil deterioriates which necessitates more intervention and more chemicals. So how can we break this vicious cycle? How can we replicate the natural process of the forest on our farms?

That is a question that has been addressed in India by [Subhash Palekar](http://palekarzerobudgetspiritualfarming.org/) in Maharashtra. Adapting Fukuoka’s model to the Indian eco-system he came up with his trademark ‘Zero Budget Spiritual Farming’. I haven’t yet read his books – next on my reading list – but almost everyone we have spoken to about natural farming in India follows his methods.

This Sunday, we were treated to a crash course on the theory behind natural farming when we were taken by a friend to CG Harshavardhan’s farm, Nandana Vana, near Chennarayapatna. Harsha was in IT in Bangalore but about seven years ago, after living in the city all his life, he decided he wanted to farm. He attended a workshop by Palekar and has never looked back. He is clearly passionate about natural farming and wholeheartedly believes in it.

Harsha explained the difference between organic farming – which uses regular farming methods minus the chemicals – and natural farming, which lets nature do the work. I am now wondering whether the organic rice, daal, jaggery and so on that we religiously buy is really as good as we thought – better I suppose than the chemical-rich alternative in the shops but still not really helping create a sustainable, natural, biodiversity-friendly agricultural system.

Harsha then went into precise detail – which I won’t reproduce here for fear of getting it slightly wrong, but which he said can be found in Palekar’s books – about how natural farming works. The key are the microbes which contain or prepare the nutrients the plants need. It is these microbes that we need to reintroduce to our farms in order to replicate nature’s work, and to do away with the need for fertilisers. And, as ever in India, it all comes down to the cow. There are 300 crore microbes in 1g of cow dung. But not just any type of cow – you need the breed local to that area. Hybrid cows from the West are not designed for India’s climate so keep getting ill. They are thus injected with lots of antibiotics and those antibiotics kill many of the microbes. (Another proof of the ill effects of antibiotics, but more about that another time.) So it is local cows you need, and preferably ones which graze freely. These breeds won’t give you much milk but they will give you plenty of microbes – in fact the less milk the better the microbe content.

Many farmers use cow dung as manure, and while it is a good source of manure, Palekar’s method goes much beyond this. His innovation was to come up with a formula to make those 300 crore microbes multiply over and over again using fermentation. This formula is jivamrtam:

In a 200 litre container of water, mix:

– 10kg cow dung

– 5-10 litres cow urine

– 1-2kg dicottylidon flour (eg: horse gram, cow pea – in Karnataka they tend to use horse gram, hurali, because it’s easily available and cheap)

– 1 kg black jaggery (not the white jaggery for which lots of chemicals are used)

– a handful of the local soil

Stir this clockwise thrice a day for two days. Then spray or splash upon one acre of land. Start off doing this perhaps four times a month and as the land becomes more fertile you can reduce to thrice and then twice a month.

That is one half of the natural farming method. The other, even more important, is mulching. In the forest, dead leaves and organic matter fall and accumulate on the forest floor, creating a thick, rich layer of humus. This is what we need to imitate on our farms because it is in this damp, cool, dark environment that microbes flourish. There are other ways to mulch – soil mulching for instance, and even using a plastic sheet (not at all recommended although apparently what is taught in agricultural colleges) – but this forest system of straw mulching is the most effective. Ideally you need a nine inch thick layer on the soil but this takes a very long time to achieve. Harsha recommends bringing in mulching material (you’re unlikely to have enough from your farm initially), whether it’s palm leaves, hay, dead leaves or whatever, and laying it on the soil. You must though ensure that you use a mixture of [monocotyledon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocotyledon) and [dicotyledon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicotyledon) mulch. You can also live mulch in which for instance you grow cow pea and other similar crops under your coconut and areca nut trees.

Another thing Harsha emphasised is the need to pack a variety of plants and trees, and as many as possible, into a small space. The aim is to mimic the five-tier system in the forest:

– big trees

– small trees

– bushes

– pulses, legumes, grains

– grasses, dead leaves

Thus here on Nandana Vana, where originally solitary coconut trees stood, you now have coconut, areca nut, gliricidia, banana, coffee and various creepers. He could also plant ginger, turmeric and even vegetables (so perhaps no need to have a separate vegetable garden as I had initially planned). And his farm is lush, so dense that you feel more like you are in Malnad than the plains.

He also showed us trenches that he has put in between saplings to ensure the roots are aerated and to collect rain water. These trenches must lie against the slope so as to retain water.

One issue Harsha found when he started out was that the jivamrtam production was too much work, and with erratic labour it just wasn’t happening. He now has an automated system, as below, connected to a regular water sprinkler system spread out throughout the farm which requires just one man to operate.

[![IMG_7199](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_7199.jpg?w=300&h=300)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_7199.jpg)

The proof is in the pudding, as they say. Harsha’s main crop is coconut,which he sells as copra after drying it for a year. His trees yield between 160-190 kg of copra per 1000 nuts, as compared to neighbouring farms which yield about 120-150kg. This of course is after several years of experimentation and lessons learnt the hard way. So it takes time, but once the soil is replenished the yields do rise. Input costs too, beyond the initial investment in cows and an automated jivamrtam production and distribution system, are very low: Harsha never uses a tractor and obviously no chemicals are required; he has four cows which provide him with all of his cow dung and urine. Here, at least, natural farming makes complete financial as well as ecological sense.
