Dharmalingam and Non-Chemical Farming

[![IMG_3075](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_3075.jpg?w=656&h=875)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_3075.jpg)

This Saturday as we were trying to track down some of the ‘model farmers’ given in [Subhash Palekar’s book](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2015/03/12/natural-farming-harshavardhan/), who have had good success with his natural farming methods and thus have become his ambassadors, we almost by chance came across a rather visionary man called Dharmalingam in a hamlet near Alur, on the way to Sakaleshpura.

Dharmalingam has about 10 acres of coffee, both Arabica and Robusta, in this fertile but very flat area full of maize fields. He started out with regular, chemical farming but then switched to Palekar’s methods within a couple of years. The process of preparing jivamrtam, though, he says was difficult especially given the labour issues, and he also found it wasn’t sufficient for his farm. After further experimentation with other non-chemical methods, such as composting, he settled on a very simple technique: using cow’s urine and dung, mixed with water to make slurry, directly on the plantation. The urine and dung go through a biodigester first to produce cooking gas for their house, and are then piped to the farm.

His plantation is wonderfully dense and rich, with many different trees and creepers among the coffee – including the all-important gliricidia that Palekar recommends. We drank fresh tender coconut water from one of the many coconut trees, sampled the ‘mixed spice leaf’ tree and some mango ginger and caught glimpses of branches laden with all manner of fruits amongst the thick foliage. He has a thick layer of houmous, created after fifteen years of continuous non-chemical farming methods, and huge boundary trees – including teak – to act as a windbreak on either side of the plantation. All quite different from the standard monocrop coffee estate of Sakaleshpura, endless rows of coffee with silver oak or occasionally areca nut for shade, and often no undergrowth at all because they put down some toxic weedkiller.

**Selling Organic As Well As Producing Organic**

Dharmalingam is the first farmer we have met in the area who uses exclusively natural methods – others do sometimes use jivamrtam and the such but alongside fertilisers and sprays – and is completely committed to this type of farming despite the fact that he himself says that it has been a lot of hard work, and his yields are not high. He sells his coffee on the local market, where there is no recognition for organic or non-chemical produce, so his lower yields aren’t made up for by a higher buying price. His running costs year-on-year decrease because his herd of cows – from which all he gets all he needs for his coffee – naturally grows bigger and there is no other outlay save for the small cost of maintaining them (they are all desi cows so no problems with disease), but that is offset to some extent by the big initial investment. The bio-digester system is quite pricey, and a fair amount goes in piping, pumps, spraying and so on to set up. He is unlikely to have the comfortable cushion of cash that those of us sitting in the city and dreaming of natural farming do, so what motivates such a person to reject the easy option of chemical farming and the guaranteed returns? Perhaps he is thinking of the long term fertility of the soil and his son’s future farming prospects. Or perhaps it is reverence for the earth, bhumi. At any rate, I hope that more channels are created to enable such farmers to sell their high quality, organic produce at the higher rate it should fetch. That might help others around him follow the trail he has blazed.

**Modifying Our Approach?**

For now, though, we are still planning to stick to the Palekar method, mainly because we would need a lot more cows than planned in order to follow Dharmalingam’s system. He has about 30 cows – including some beautiful Gir from Gujarat, the purest and oldest desi cow breed apparently – and advises that each cow have about an acre of grazing pasture. We plan to start with two or three Malenad Giddas, the local variety. Even if we had the resources to buy more initially, where would we graze them all? Grazing rights in Indian villages can be, from what I have read, a source of contention so I think we’d want to stick to our own land rather than venture into government grazing land, at least initially. After reading a friend of a [friend’s misadventure buying a coffee estate in Chikkamagalur](http://www.oursatori.blogspot.in/) and eventually being hounded out by two locals, we want to tread carefully.

**Palekar Model Test Site**

Mr Basavaraj is currently planting the one and a half acres that are relatively barren at the moment with coffee, and I have persuaded him also to plant gliricidia, banana and a few coconut and areca nut trees as per Palekar’s diagram – although he remains unconvinced about the latter two. Once the major planting is done, I will figure out what ‘pigeon pea’ etc are in Kannada and try to plant this and the other recommended intercrops around each coffee plant – these provide the right shade and nutrients and keep off the harmful insects, bacteria and fungus. And I will also try to dig the trenches for proper draining and aeration and start mulching in the right way and with the right material. This 1.5 acres will be my test site. We can start the jivamrtam only after we get a cow shed and then our cows, hopefully next year, so for now Mr Basavaraj and I have agreed that he will only use cow-dung and neem cake and earthworms – no chemicals at all (although he does want to spray copper sulphate and lime in October so I need to find an alternative if we’re not happy with that). I just hope that the delay in jivamrtam production doesn’t affect the experimental site too much, especially as I can imagine it will take us quite some time even after we get the cows to figure out how to make it and distribute it to the crops.

Mr Basavaraj has 43 years of experience of producing excellent coffee. All I have done is read a few books. Still, he is receptive to these ideas – and I plan to get him the Kannada version of Palekar’s books – and I am ready to compromise on certain ideals in deference to his greater practical knowledge so hopefully we will make a good partnership yet.

A friend recommended we watch ‘[One Man One Cow One World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201582/)‘ recently. We haven’t yet but I understand it’s all about biodynamics which I’m guessing is not far off from Dharmalingam’s methods. More on this soon.
