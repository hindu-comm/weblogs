Yurting

[![yurt in sun](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/yurt-in-sun.jpg?w=656)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/yurt-in-sun.jpg)After spending two nights in a beautifully decorated, candlelit yurt in deepest darkest Wales, courtesy of Christa Kaula who runs [Cwm MynysYurt Holidays](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/917558), we are complete yurt converts.

There is a very special energy when sleeping and living in a yurt, perhaps from the wooden struts leading up and into a sort of window to heaven in the transparent or open cupola, and perhaps too from being in a perfectly round room. This was what sold us on the yurt.

It has practical advantages though too. The standard 18 feet yurt is plenty big enough for a family to sleep, eat and live. Ours had a double bed, sofa, small dining table, wood-burning stove and some simple shelves and low tables, and we still had room to lay out our yoga mat beneath the cupola. And yet it is small and cosy enough to ensure you are together as a family, rather than living in your separate rooms, leading your separate lives (ok perhaps more appropriate with toddlers than teenagers). We love the fact that you can build a yurt yourself, and that most of them can be assembled and dismantled fairly easily, making them very portable.

Gautam has already sketched our expandable satellite yurt house with adjoining compost loo and wood-fired bathroom, plus outside decking for a sitting room,

and we are thinking about how to adapt them for the warm, wet climate of Sakaleshpura. In the equally wet but cold Wales, the wood-burning stove kept us incredibly cosy but in India the biggest problem would of course be heat. We would probably need to have many more windows, with just mesh and a pull-down plastic cover in heavy rain. We’d put mesh around the bottom of the yurt too – well sealed to prevent snakes and other creepy crawlies getting in – and have a cupola which would be open except in rain to get a good ventilation system going from bottom to top. And perhaps we’d need to look into a waterproof material which is more breathable than the normal canvas. We could have smaller yurts for guests which could be moved around easily and even taken down for the monsoon months if not used.

It doesn’t look like anyone is making yurts in India so far – surely a trick is being missed there? – so we are thinking of building a prototype ourselves and taking it on from there. Any yurt enthusiasts that would like to lend a hand, or offer some advice, are most welcome.
