The Leech Test

[![IMG_8420](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_8420.jpg?w=656&h=492)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_8420.jpg)

After our [leech encounter](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/leeches/ "Leeches"), I devised a leech test:

a\) find the lowest, most shady part of a plantation, preferably thickly covered in dead leaves and near a river

b\) brace yourself

c\) walk in (the first time I did this I was, rather bravely, wearing shorts and chappals; now I wear trousers, trekking shoes and leech socks)

d\) kick around in the undergrowth a bit, walk around, stand still for a few seconds in several places

e\) walk out onto clear ground and inspect your ankles, legs, shoes and socks

We found leeches – well one to be precise (as in the photo above) – down by the river in Donigal, right where we had been camping most of March and early April. The thought of suddenly discovering your campsite, and quite possibly your tent too, infested with leeches is quite horrifying, although Gautam tells me I am overreacting and should return to the urban jungle. At any rate, Donigal is still relatively leech-free, compared to Heggadde and Kadumane.

What we realise, and this is probably self-evident, is that the more rainfall a place gets, the more leeches. Rainfall itself is a controversial statistic. Brokers and landowners will always under-quote the amount of rain a place gets because Sakleshpur is one of those areas that gets far too much of the stuff. Around Kadumane tea estate they get 300 inches of rain a year. Heggadde gets around 180 inches (we were assured 120 inches maximum) and Donigal 140-150 inches. Sullaki, where we have found a very promising gentle valley property, gets only 80-100 inches. Is that enough, Gautam wondered as we were driving back to Bangalore. We want to really feel like we are in Malenad (‘the land of rain’), and we love the drama of the ghat thunderstorm. So we checked how much rainfall Bangalore – which is never dry long and has a wealth of greenery – gets in a year. Just under 40 inches. And London, where it never stops raining? About 32-33 inches a year. So Satekal’s 80 inches may seem niggardley in Sakleshpur terms but to us it will be a wealth of precipitation.

And in fact as it turns out, 80-100 inches is about the optimum rainfall for this type of land. You can’t really grow coffee or indeed much at all – save for tea presumably – with 300 inches of rain a year. Whereas in Sullaki you can grow all kinds of crops and fruit trees, even mango, which is rarely found in this area because it’s too wet. Gautam, who has always wanted a mango orchard, was recently inspired by an article on a farmer near Mangalore who has managed to grow about 400 varieties of fruits from around the world. And we would love to make marmalade, which is still hard to find in India.
