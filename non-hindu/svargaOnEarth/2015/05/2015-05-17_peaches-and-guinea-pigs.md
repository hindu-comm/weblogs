Peaches and Guinea Pigs

Where do you find fresh rosemary, thyme and sage in Bangalore? How about butternut squash, celery and asparagus? And peaches, mulberries and gooseberries (not the ubiquitous ‘Indian gooseberry’, amla, but the real, English deal)?

Navzer and Shahnaz Kothawala’s forest home is not strictly speaking in Bangalore, but at 40 km distance it is but a peach stone’s throw from the city. And here indeed grow all manner of herbs, vegetables and fruits, from the humble cucumber to the exotic kale.

The Kothawalas’ vegetable garden and orchard includes many species which are not only *not* native to India, but which normally thrive in, for instance, the cool, dampness of England. Yet with only the tender care of Shahnaz Aunty, who rears each little seedling in empty dahi pots on her kitchen windsill, and the oversight of Navzer Uncle, who creates a pest-repellent with the urine of the cows the couple keep and wards off marauding elephants by planting milk bush, this hot, normally very dry landscape has become home to a cornucopia of edible flora from around the world.

The Kothawalas’ purchased their six acres of land about ten years ago from Navadarshanam Trust, a cooperative with spiritual leanings that also practices natural farming. We were fortunate enough to meet them a few months ago on a visit to Navadarshanam, and this weekend took them up on their kind invitation to come and stay.

In line with the Navadarshanam philosophy, the couple are aiming at a completely self-sufficient lifestyle – and this at an age when most are settling down to comfy sofas and remote controls. They use solar power for light, and for hot and running water in the house. Gobar gas from their cows provides for all their cooking needs. For their plants and trees they have a huge tank to collect rainwater and a pipe and drip irrigation system which lets gravity do all the work. And their food requirements are largely taken care of by their livestock – cows for milk, ghee and curd, ducks and geese for eggs – and their plants and trees. Aunty has even started growing black eyed peas (lobia) in her vegetable garden.

It is they admit a tough life, especially with the aches and pains – and falls – that age brings, but seeing them here in the beautiful simplicity of their house, surrounded by lush greenery in this arid land, and attended on by an Irish Setter, three stray puppies, a handful of cats, their ducks, geese and cows, a rapidly multiplying litter of guinea pigs and the odd frog, it is difficult to imagine them anywhere else.
