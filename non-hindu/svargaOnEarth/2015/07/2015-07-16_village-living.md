Village Living

One of the things we love about camping in Sakleshpur is that it enables us to pare back life to the absolute minimum. Our first camping trip was so minimalistic that we had no food (bar some peanuts and khakra) and got very little sleep. It was a beautiful night and one we will always remember but we decided then that food and sleep were both important – this side of absolute minimum – and upgraded our camping experience accordingly. We now have our basics sorted, from air mattresses to solar lanterns to collapsible water containers, and camping is comfortable as well as magical.

This weekend was a step up as it were, in that we stayed at the village house that our friend Ashish has rented, situated right at the entrance to our farm. Here as well as four walls and a roof over our heads – and ones which you don’t have to put up and take down – we also enjoyed the luxury of a loo, a shower and a kitchen. The house is connected to mains electricity (which in rural India means intermittent, low-voltage power supply), has plenty of water but none of it running and is built in the local style – Mangalore-tiled roof and red oxide floors. Mahesh, the owner, is renting a place in Sakleshpur town because his children now go to school there but he comes here every day to work on his five acres of coffee which surround the house.

This is the first time I have properly lived – we have stayed in even simpler village settings before, especially in the mountains, but always as someone’s guest – in a village house and it opened my eyes in many ways. It took us an hour and a half on the first morning just to heat up water so we could bathe, and another hour or so for me to attempt to cook some breakfast. The kitchen has no provision for water at all. All water-based activities, including washing vegetables, rinsing knives and sticky hands, and washing the dishes happens elsewhere. The kitchen is soley for cooking – there is a wood-fired stove which, once you get a good fire going, is fairly effective.

I couldn’t figure out the normal way of washing dishes – no soap or scrubber (and certainly no fairy liquid and hot running water) in sight. I vaguely remembered that you could use ash but in the end we went into town and bought the ubiquitous vim bar and green scrubbing pad, and, crouched at the edge of a concrete platform outside with a bucket of water, I managed. I’m sure there must be a better arrangement though because this way you soon have a muddy, dirty area near the house. No sinks here of course.

Sinks are in fact one of those modern inventions we find indispensable but without which much of the world functions perfectly fine. Besides the waterless kitchen, there is no sink in the bathroom of a normal village house either. Instead you have several buckets for storing water, and a small cup for pouring. (I am not yet sure whether etiquette dictates that you brush your teeth and spit into the bathroom drain or somewhere outside – we played safe and spat on the grass a little away from the house.) What Ashish’s new house does have though is a very effective water heating system. Behind the bathroom is a small stove where you burn wood. You fill the stone tank inside the bathroom and within an hour or so you have hot water, and hot water which remains warm for a good 24 hours.

The backyard has a large sloping stone for washing clothes. As my attempts to hand-wash large items of clothing – Gautam’s jeans for instance – have never been very successful, and as we are usually only in Sakleshpur for two or three days at a time, I decided to bundle our very muddy clothes into a bag and take them back to the joy of our fully automatic washing machine in Bangalore. Given the mud and rain here in the monsoon, clothes washing is something we need to find a solution to. Solar powered washing machine…?

The entrance to the loo, as is often the case, is from outside the house. This is I imagine to do with ideas of cleanliness and pollution. Traditional Indian thinking goes that you should keep the loo away from the house, and certainly distant from the bathroom – which is for cleaning. In reality when you have a water-based loo (not flush here of course but the regular Indian style) you tend to build it adjacent to the bathroom to make plumbing easier. Adjacent, but not inside the bathroom; the bathroom in this set up remains soley a room for bathing. I’m guessing that by having the access to the loo outside the house, and as far away from the bathroom door as is possible for two adjacent rooms, you sort of maintain those cleanliness norms in spirit if not in practice. (By the by, the way the developed world lives, with several bathrooms per house most of which have a bath/shower plus loo, often a hair’s breadth apart, must seem bizarre and rather unclean to those used to the village system.)

As well as vastly increasing my respect for the Indian housewife, three days of village living has helped firm up our ideas of what we want and need from our container-living home which will ultimately be a sort of permanent campsite, where we pitch our tents and/or sleep in the containers, but with everything else outside. One thing I have decided is definitely part of my bare minimum is the sink – so we are going to have one for washing hands, and one for washing dishes (because in India you don’t wash hands and dishes in the same place, again a very sound principle) – with drainage leading off into the jungle at the back.
