In The Box

Converting shipping containers into living spaces is super trendy at themoment. And not surprisingly. After all it’s green, because you’re recycling the container. It’s very practical, because the containers are incredibly strong, water-, rust-, fire-, animal- and human-proof. And it is much cheaper and quicker to modify a container than start from scratch with regular construction methods. But what really gets people excited is seeing photos like this:

Because yes container homes can also look fabulous – with enough creativity, and money. The fact that most of the container home groupies though end up with rather more prosaic structures doesn’t seem to put people off.

So anyway we decided to jump on the bandwagon and get ourselves a container or two for storage and shelter for the next few wet months in Sakleshpur. We found two containers for sale in Mysore of all places. Umesh, who is setting up a pet resort on the outskirts of the city, had bought them a couple of years ago but then changed his plans. Luckily for us, it turns out Umesh is something of an expert on containers and the source of much sound advice. We planned to have them delivered to Sakleshpur and set up on a clearing we had made before the rains arrived. Once the monsoon started, we would then have a place to store all of our camping and estate gear, and a basic shelter for day or night when it was really wet. Perfect.

The containers in a field near Mysore

Inevitably it wasn’t quite so simple. We weren’t able to transport the containers until mid-June. They did thankfully make it to the edge of the estate but could get no further on the new dirt – now deep mud – road that we had cleared a couple of weeks before. So there they sit, waiting for the rain to end. We need to organise a truck plus a crane to move them to the clearing which is right at the other end of the estate, and for that we need the land to dry out and harden up. Right now, you sink into mud even while walking so you can imagine how a crane lifting a 2.5 tonne metal box would fare. The dirt road is also criss-crossed by fallen trees which need to be cleared, but until the heavy rain and high winds stop it’s too dangerous to send people in to do that.

In the meantime, we thought we’d at least make the platforms ready for them to sit on. Our initial plan was to have one raised up by about 10 feet, a terrace balcony on the lower one which would lead into the upper one, a cow shed underneath and so on.

Gautam’s sketch

The patient Mr Rajnikanth, a civil engineer in Sakleshpur, worked out a way of doing this with concrete pillars or steel girders, but with the rain and looking at our budget we decided to go for a much simpler option. So now the plan is to dig shallow pits, fill them with jelly stones (a type of gravel) and then place three wooden beams for each container to sit on. This seems the easiest and cheapest although at the moment even the tractor bringing the jelly stones can’t get through because of the mud.

So while we wait, here are our basic plans for the containers. We have got lots of inspiration and useful advice from [http://www.containerhouse.wordpress.com](http://www.containerhouse.wordpress.com); I even bought the eBook. The sketch ups have been done by our friend Mateen who is helping us out with this project.

The first container is for storage, and we might also put a bike or two in it. The second we plan to work on a bit – put in a window or two, a sunroof to keep it cool (we have placed them in the shade of a tree but still it’s going to get hot) and a mesh door. We hope to put solar panels and water tanks on top of the storage one, and also create some kind of a rain/sun shelter for the space between the two where we can cook.

The kitchen will be an open-air one, a kind of souped up clay stove – no mess, very sociable and we love the taste of wood-cooked food. For a shower, we’ll have a simple stone slab with bamboo walls off the back of one of the containers, with a bucket and mug and the water running off via a channel to the jungle behind the container.

The loo has taken a bit of thought and lots of research. We wanted an eco-friendly loo which needed minimal water and minimal or no maintenance, by us or a service company. A compost loo was the obvious fit and we chose to go for the one that can compost the waste material on site, so no need for us to ever transport waste. We found an Indian-style system designed and promoted by [Biome Solutions](http://www.biome-solutions.com/), an eco-architect in Bangalore, which we could easily implement. This system separates dry and wet waste, and accommodates the Indian need for washing. There are two chambers for the dry waste. Once one is full, that part of the loo is closed for about 10 months to allow the waste to compost while the other side is used. The compost can be used on the estate. Urine is collected and used as a fertiliser. So no ‘waste’ at all in fact, just useful bio-products. We bought the plastic moulds for the two sides of the loo from the friendly Mr Nathan at [Fibro](https://plus.google.com/108436340074980965528/about?gl=in&hl=en) in Rajajinagar for the princely sum of Rs 1200 each. We’ll have to build a concrete base in which the chambers sit but can then have a bamboo upper section – walls and door – so costs should remain low. And thankfully there is a Unicef-sponsored 160-plus page [handbook](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~chariarv/EcologicalSanitationHandbook.pdf) on this type of loo, including specs and building plans, so we can just follow that.

The sketchup drawing of the loo

Sounds brilliant doesn’t it? Gautam though is not so thrilled. He thinks it’s too much to expect people to re-learn how to use a loo and I have to admit it might be a bit of a challenge. I mean, what do we do when we have friends coming to stay – do we send them this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV-1To9DkJQ) first and ask them to practise their aim?

There are also electric composting loos which are much simpler to use, but they cost about \$2,000 and I’m guessing they’re not available in Bangalore. So for now we’ll see how we get on with this system and anyway anyone who can’t handle this has a whole 16 acres at their disposal – although now that the leeches have started they may be wary of squatting in the jungle…
