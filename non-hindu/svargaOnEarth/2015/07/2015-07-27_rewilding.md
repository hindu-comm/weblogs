Rewilding

In our quest to learn about and pursue the natural life, we keep coming across all kinds of adjectives we would never have used in relation to living. Some, such as ‘primal’, need no explanation. Others, such as ‘happy crunchy’, took a bit of imagination and googling. The latest is ‘feral’.

This is one of the terms [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/) uses in a series of extremely interesting, albeit at times quite far out, articles and podcasts on what he calls ‘rewilding’. His idea is that we need to return to the animal in us to recapture what it is to be human. I think we are in some ways over-civilised, dangerously out of touch with ourselves and our environment because of the artificial, progressive world we have built and inhabit. However, civilisation has had and continues to have many many advantages and is indeed surely one of the things that makes us human, as opposed to animal. In fact, Vedanta tells us that to be born human is a great blessing. It is only in this manushya-janma (human birth) that we are able to better our credit history in the bank of punya and papa (not translating as not fully translatable – look them up) and thus move towards moksha or liberation. So feral seems to me several steps too far, particularly when it manifests in the belief – which Daniel espouses – that killing animals for food, for instance, is something we do naturally (although I do agree that if you are going to eat meat you should be fully aware of what you are doing, and the best way to do that is to be involved in the killing process yourself).

Having said that, his [Rewild Yourself Magazine](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-magazine/) is full of really thought-provoking stuff on all the biggies – birth, death, sex, drugs – and also things you might not have thought of in this connection, such as exercise and movement (check out [MovNat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGF-ErsJiI) – we are already wondering if we can start workshops on this on our land). So for instance he talks about how we have been cut off from the realities of birth and death by rarely or never witnessing them except in the anodyne, controlled environment of hospital (at least in Western, urban existence), and the impact that can have on us sub-consciously – our fear of both, our inability to process grief and so on. He also interviews some very qualified, dare I say mainstream, specialists on all kinds of things and some of the resulting podcastsreally open you up to new perspectives and ways of thinking.
