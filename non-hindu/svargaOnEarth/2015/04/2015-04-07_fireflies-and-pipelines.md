Fireflies and Pipelines

“If you want to buy land in India you should be wary of two things.” said Gautam’s uncle, Sri [KN Rao](http://www.journalofastrology.com/page.php?page=knrao), when we told him of our plans. “Litigation, and government projects.” Wise words. We have indeed run into big problems because of the latter.

Donigal, where the estate is located, is it turns out very strategically located not just for Bangalore weekenders like us but also for various government projects. We had heard that the government might be doubling the railway track that borders part of our land, but that was a fairly distant prospect until we read an article about it in the papers. And then we read about the highway – at present a couple of kilometres from the estate and thankfully out of earshot – which is due to be widened all the way to Mangalore. Ok so perhaps a bit of disturbance when and if they go ahead with the projects, but it would also make it more accessible for us and friends visiting us so we could live with that as a trade off.

And then out of the blue came a pipeline. A huge pipeline, 75 metres wide with a service road and possibly high tension wires, to bring water from the ghats (where in places there is 300 inches of rain a year) to the thirsty, dusty parts of Karnataka. This project, the Yettinahole pipeline, as of now is scheduled to run right through the middle of the 10-12 acres we had planned to buy. A survey is on to ascertain the exact route of the pipe and only after that will we sit down with the current owner and decide what is left to sell and whether he still wants to sell and we still want to buy.

To cheer us out of the gloom this news had spread, we had a magical evening camping near the river with lighting provided by a host of fireflies and the all-but-full moon. Gautam and a friend, Vanni, came on two of the bikes – our first ride to the land, we were big riders before Utpalaksh was born – and had fun crossing the river. Surprisingly neither of the Enfields – a bike which is known for its tendency to break down – had any problems during the ride both on road and off road. It was rather the almost brand new Pajero Sport which somehow slashed the sidewall of a tyre just as we were leaving, necessitating a very hot and sweaty tyre change and making us very glad we had invested in an offroad exhaust jack just a week or so before.

We rounded off the trip with a visit to Radhika and her daughter Tavishi – who is eight days younger than Utpalaksh – at the stunning Kadumane tea estate, all 7,000 acres of it. Both Utpalaksh and Tavishi are already seasoned Bullet riders (with their respective fathers) and when we put the two of them on a bike together they were raring to go.

The survey is due by 10th April. More news thereafter.
