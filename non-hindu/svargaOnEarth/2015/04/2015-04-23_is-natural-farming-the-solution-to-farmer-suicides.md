Is Natural Farming The Solution to Farmer Suicides?

[Yesterday a farmer committed suicide at a public rally of the AAP in Delhi.](http://http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/horror-of-farm-suicide-visits-delhi/article7131796.ece)
The politicians are all busy blaming each other, but could it be that instead of farmer-friendly policies, debt relief or doing away with the land-acquisition bill the solution lies in natural farming? This is what Subhash Palekar proposes. He says that the way in which modern agriculture functions, where farmers buy special high-yielding seeds rather than the local, cheap variety, then need to purchase expensive chemicals and fertilisers to produce that high yield rather than letting nature do the work, is bankrupting farmers and at the same time eroding the land they farm. And it becomes a vicious circle. The more they use the chemicals and fertilisers, the more they deplete the soil of its nutrients and so they need to buy even more chemicals and fertilisers to make up for this lack to get the same yield. His method, Zero Budget Spiritual Farming, requires no investment save local seeds and local cows, and enriches the soil year on year.

Itâ€™s an attractive proposition, and one which the Modi government might do well to investigate fully. If it works, of course. And does it work? It certainly has in many cases. And we are looking forward to puttinghis methods into practice. Once we see the results for ourselves we should be able to answer that question.
