Leeches

Last night I dreamt of leeches.

We havemetthe Western Ghat leech before on one or two occasions, and parted fairly amicably. So when we ask brokers if there are leeches – – jigane in Kannada, a word we learnt early on in our land hunt – in a particular area in the rains, and they say yes, as they inevitably do, we usually remain fairly sanguine about it.

Not any more.

We discovered a really stunning abandoned coffee estate near Heggadde, further down Shiradi Ghat and very close to the picturesque river that leads down the valley to the bottom of the hills. Here you really feel like you are in the Western Ghats proper, with steep sweeping curves, huge trees overhanging the road and frequent cloud bursts. This is it, we thought, on Saturday afternoon as we hurriedly walked through part of the estate before the rain started, and then drove back through the ferocious downpour. Sunday morning we were back there early to take it all in and confirm our choice. A neighbour did warn us that elephants pass through – but we thought that might change once we cultivate it and are living there – and that yes there are leeches in the wet season. It wasn’t until we were heading back to the car after a 20 minute walk through the relatively penetrable part of the estate that we decided to check for leeches. (You don’t feel a thing with these leeches, neither when they’re climbing up you, attaching themselves, feeding or falling off – they fall off of their own accord once they’ve had their fill – so you can only detect them by seeing them on you.) Almost ten between us on our ankles, rather a lot but still manageable; Gautam (chief leech plucker-off as I am a bit squeamish) dealt with those fairly swiftly.
It was later on when I felt something clammy on my inner thigh, and then noticed a patch of blood forming elsewhere on my trousers, that we realised the full extent of the leech offensive: four high on the thighs and one on the chest. Uppu, thankfully, who’d been in the Ergobaby on my back, was unscathed. And this was after a short walk in trekking shoes and long trousers during which we had kept our eyes open for them on the ground – and spotted only one the entire time, they really do appear out of nowhere – and had consciously kept moving in low-lying areas so they wouldn’t have a chance to latch on.

Harmless yes, beneficial maybe (leech therapy and all that, but what a bloody mess thanks to the anti-coagulant they release. And you also have to guard against infection, both from the open wounds they create and from itching the bites as they begin to heal. We also took no care in plucking them off. Apparently you should do it in such a way that they release their grip on you so that no part of them gets stuck to the wound; we also read (later) that you should never try to get rid of them mid-suck with salt etc because that can cause them to vomit up the blood they’ve drunk thus causing an infection. Nice. Let’s hope our frantic plucking off of the by-now engorged creatures won’t lead to any complications. (And no we didn’t have the presence of mind to take photos of the blood sucking as we hurriedly disrobed in the middle of a village road but here is one I found online.)

Our main worry too is children. Adults can take precautions – leech socks are next on our online shopping list – but how do children play in such an area? The locals obviously manage. Indeed they all walk around the estates in dhotis and skirts, and most often with only chappals or bare feet, and somehow manage to avoid being bitten perhaps by applying tabacco or salt on their legs, or some other means we haven’t yet discovered. Do they stop their children going into the forest or even plantation land (coffee estates have many less leeches because of the chemicals they use and because the leaf litter is normally cleared), or playing in rivers and lakes, during this season?

We are concerned too that the way we intend to grow coffee using natural farming, in which there are no chemicals and mulching (lots of dead organic matter, like leaf litter) is a very critical part, would mean that even after we ‘cultivate’ the land there would be leeches aplenty. Indeed, we are trying to re-create the forest in natural farming so we can’t expect the forest’s natural inhabitants not to live there. I remember Harsha, whose natural farm near Chennarayapatna we visited, saying that his workers have to wear gumboots whenever they go into the plantation because of the snakes. There is no cleared land in natural farming, it is all covered in mulch as in the forest and thus very wildlife-friendly.

So where does this leave us? Well for one if we want to be in the Western Ghats – which we do because we love the landscape so much – we will have to find some way of co-existing with such creatures. We understand now why all the houses are built at a promontory and surrounded by a large cleared dirt area. The latter may not look so pretty but at least it keeps the leeches and snakes at a safe distance most of the time. And second we would probably be better off finding a place which is either at a height or has a high point where we could set up our living area (small cottage, godown for the workers etc), so that leeches are minimised. So long as there is enough sunlight and the land is high enough, it dries out after the rainy season and becomes leech free. Anywhere that has leeches in the summer is automatically crossed off our list; imagine what it would be like in the rains.

Sometimes I do think fondly of the benign landscape of England. No leeches, no Naxalites, no king cobras or crates, no elephants even. Proper grass which doesn’t need watering, conkers, abundant greenery in the summer, blackberries, the excitement of snow. A different world indeed.

And now, given that we are well into the pre-monsoon showers, for those leech socks.
