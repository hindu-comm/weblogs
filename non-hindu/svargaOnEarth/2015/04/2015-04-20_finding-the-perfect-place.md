Finding The Perfect Place

The survey to determine exactly where the Yettinahole pipeline will go was meant to be completed on 10th April. It is now 19th April and with no survey in sight, and various other rumours doing the rounds, we have started to look at other sites.

So here’s our wishlist for theperfect piece of land:

Having attached river (as the brokers say) – a small stream would do, but something like this would be the works

[![IMG_20150418_171828](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_20150418_171828.jpg?w=656&h=492)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/img_20150418_171828.jpg)

Hilly – less practical but so much more beautiful

High – preferably above 900 metres, so as to be as cool as or cooler than Bangalore

Lush – for which about 60 inches of rain a year is minimum; one place we saw had an average of 300 a year…

Free from (an excess of) elephants and leeches – the occasional elephant is manageable, and leeches are a reality in most places in the monsoon, but too much of either makes things difficult

No Naxalites – some parts of the hills around Sakleshpur are known to harbour Naxalites, particularly around Bisle Ghat road so we’ve been told

Jungle or neglected coffee – a fully functioning coffee plantation would be way beyond our budget so we are looking only at places that have the crucial plantation classification but are either partially or entirely overgrown

Clear papers – ideally single owner and CRC certificate; at any rate enough to get the go ahead from our lawyer

No more than 15-20km beyond Sakleshpur, or before Sakleshpur

Not on Hanbal road – Hanbal has become home to all of Sakleshpur’s mushrooming resorts and homestays so dreams of wilderness peace are likely to be short-lived; it is also a potholed ribbon of a road which can add up to an hour and a half onto your journey from Bangalore

We’d be incredibly lucky to find a place with all of this – and some are incompatible (for instance it’s hard to find a really hilly place which is not on Hanbal road and yet high; the hills really start on Shiradi Ghat road which descends from about 900m to sea level) – but we can but try.
