Organic: Good or Bad?

I’ve almost finished Palekar’s *The Philosophy of Spiritual Farming, Part 1*. Particularly interesting is his condemnation of organic farming. Organic farming, he says, is even worse than chemical farming partly because it purports to be natural and eco-friendly while in truth being far from it, and partly because it promotes organic fertilisers and pesticides which are even pricier, thus further straining farmers’ financial resources. He is particularly scathing about vermicomposting, which apparently uses imported worms which are not really earth worms and which completely fail to do the beneficial tasks that the humble earth worm does, while degrading the soil in other ways. And he also condemns the agnihotra practice of burning certain cow products – primarily milk and ghee which as he points out could instead be consumed by the many undernourished rural dwellers in India; natural farming by contrast only uses those cow products that aren’t consumable by humans – along with dead leaves to effect changes in the atmosphere.

It reminds me of a conversation I had with [Gaia’s Cup](http://www.gaias-cup.org/), a brand of ‘wildlife-friendly’coffee.
Their coffee isn’t classified as organic, they said, because they are more focused on protecting the natural ecosystem in which the coffee was grown – eg: having enough shade trees, and having a mix of plants and trees – rather than on using only organicfertilisers and pesticides.
They showed me pictures of coffee plantations where endless coffee bushes stretched for miles with no tree in sight – sun coffee. Organic yes, but kind of missing the point. So has organic now become a dirty word?

Well not in the city at least. In fact one thing we have noticed in the last year or so, since we first became aware that there was such a thing as natural farming, is thatthe buzz words ‘natural farming’, ‘Fukuoka/The One Straw Revolution’, ‘permaculture’ and ‘Subash Palekar/Zero Budget Spiritual Farming’ are almost unknownamong urbanites. We have been surprised to find small-scale landowners around Sakleshpur and Subrahmanya aware of and practising the methods Palekar has devised – jivamrta and mulching. Natural farmers indeed though they may not know or use the English phrase. Perhaps though this is due to Palekar’s methods being in some way accepted by the government of Karnataka. Zero Budget Spiritual Farming may not yet be taught in agricultural colleges, but there is clearly an active grass-roots movement propagating it through workshops and word of mouth. In Bangalore, though, save for the urban farming enthusiasts, few are aware that this type of farming exists. Instead alternative farming means organic, and organic products and restaurants are all the rage.
