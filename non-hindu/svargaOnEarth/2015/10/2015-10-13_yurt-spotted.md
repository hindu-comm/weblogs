Yurt Spotted

Far away from their natural habitat, the Mongolian Steppes, we spotted a brace of yurts this weekendhigh in the Chikmagalur hills.

These are perhaps the only yurts in South India, lovingly and painstakingly built by [Yash and Salisha Chandra](http://oursatori.blogspot.in/) a couple of years ago. Mr Modegowda, who lives there currently and manages the property, kindly showed us around as we dodged the incredibly tiny leeches that are everywhere on this hillside. What a spot and how beautiful the yurts look, inside and out, projecting out into the coffee plantation on stilts.

Further confirmation, not that we needed it, that yurts are what we want to live in in Sakaleshpura. We are though wondering how to build them to be more lightweight and airy for the heat and humidity.
