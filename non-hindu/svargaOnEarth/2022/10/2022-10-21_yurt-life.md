If only it was always summer…

The stars are normally still out when I take a shower in the mornings.It’s cold in the open air, but the camping shower is burning hot and steam rises up into the night sky through a semi-circle of tree tops just visible in the dawn lightening.I dash back into the yurt and get changed in front of the flickering orange flames of the wood burning stove kindled into life a few minutes earlier, the very sight of the fire banishing the morning chill.By 6:30, as I finish my simple yoga sequence by the light of the diya, the owl sounds its final call before making way for the morning chorus.With the yurt now warming nicely, it’s time for the boys to roll out of bed and get ready for the day.

But yurt living isn’t always so idyllic (and if rising before the lark to light the fire isn’t your idea of idyllic, skip straight to the bills section below).As with any such sustainable, off-grid structure, climate and weather have a huge impact on day-to-day life.You feel much more alive like this, the outdoors no longer driven out of doors, your experience of the real world no longer mediated by glass and walls and insulation.It can take some adapting to though.

We built our structures over the winter, beautiful but cold

**Weather**

The British are known to be obsessed with the weather on this meteorogically mercurial island.Most people have at least two weather apps that they check daily if not hourly, and small talk here is dominated by comments about how cold/hot/mild/wet/dry/grey it is/has been/will be.(This in spite of the fact that surveys show Britons spend 90% of their time indoors, insulated, literally and metaphorically, from all that the weatherman can hurl at them.)So while we don’t have the extreme weather situations of say Toronto or Delhi, we have to be prepared for all four seasons all of the time.

Rain, the bane of English life, has been conspicuous by its absence over the last few months.In wet winters (or wet summers), yurt dwellers can have problems with damp and mould, but our wood burner is so effective at heating up and drying out this space, and our yurt so well made, that I think we could survive any number of rainy days.And we love listening to the rain on the yurt’s skin.Even the briefest, lightest shower announces its presence loud and clear, just like when you’re camping.Except that thankfully we are not in a polyester tent so don’t wake up with everything damp after even the hottest summer’s night.Nor does the pitter patter herald a day of huddling in the tent extension waiting for a let up in the rain to cook on the camping stove, while everything becomes gradually more muddy, sodden and wet-dog-smelling.Bitter experience with monsoon rain in Sakleshpur taught us the value of having your bathroom, loo and kitchen not only under cover but also accessible without having to don wellies.Here the decking that connects the structures keeps the mud safely at bay.In fact in many ways rain at this time of year is welcome, because rain means cloud cover, and cloud cover means the temperature will most probably stay above 10 degrees, so no need to burn the fire at night or glove-up to enter the kitchen in the morning.

Our issue this summer was sunshine. This summer had some of the hottest days on record, and, with the yurt in full sunlight from early dawn to late dusk, it got hot, very hot. So hot that some evenings we couldn’t go inside until after 7pm.Just a few weeks later, in September, we had, very unusually, two ground frosts.By keeping the wood burner going most of the night, wearing woollen jumpers and skiing socks in bed, and blocking out draughts, we can regulate the temperature inside the yurt reasonably easily – although next year we promise to buy ourselves a yurt ‘carpet’ to keep out the cold that creeps in between the gaps in the decking-board floor – but the rest of our set up outside the yurt becomes mercilessly cold.The large shed which serves as kitchen was beautifully cool in the summer but on clear cold autumn mornings I cook in gloves and a winter coat, and the boys try to warm their hands on the gas flames (I wish we had explored the possibility of fitting an old fashioned wood-fired range which gives you hob, oven, hot water and a warm kitchen).

It’s also increasingly dark.As the sun rises a little later, sets a little earlier and moves a little further south each day, we are falling into almost perpetual shade so that even when the sun is out and warm our kitchen remains cold, gloomy and damp as there’s no source of heat.Good for food preservation, milk and cheese no longer needs to be refrigerated; not so good for long hours cooking and washing up.I’ve taken to doing all the food prep for the next day’s meals the afternoon before because it’s so chilly and dark in the morning, temperamental solar lights notwithstanding, that neither eyes nor fingers work properly.I’ve also taken chapati, dosa, cheela, chutney and all those other delicious but time-consuming Indian foods off the menu.It’s daal-chaval, porridge and if you’re lucky upma.

We are now in October and night-time temperatures vary wildly.It can be a chilly 2 or 3 degrees one night, and a sultry 14 the next.By November the proper frosts will start.That doesn’t just mean proper cold, it also affects other things.Certain types of cooking gas for instance don’t work in sub-zero temperatures.For us the main issue is that our water supply – currently a long hose from an outdoor tap, although we are kind of set up for rainwater harvesting – would freeze.There are easy fixes for this, and ways to insulate and possibly even heat the kitchen, but our yurt is going to be packed up for the winter as we head to India.For all that I love yurt life, and even if we had designed it to be liveable year-round, the darkest depths of English winter would probably have to be endured rather than enjoyed.

Apart from the weather, the two other biggest changes from conventional living are probably space constraints and the lack of mod-cons.

**Space**

When you build any living structure yourself, you tend to build small. Creating a home is incredibly hard work, and every extra square foot is worth its weight in blood, sweat and tears, not to mention hard-earned cash.We didn’t build here from scratch in the same way that we did in India.The yurt was made by a friend, [Emily Gainsford](https://milliesyurts.com), who lives in nearby Bridport and has been perfecting yurts suitable for this climate over many years.Gautam apprenticed with her,steam-bending roof struts made from locally sourced ash and cutting out sections of felt for the carefully tailored cover.Our yurt is 18ft in diameter, roughly the same size as our earthbag house in Sakleshpur.Our kitchen is a pre-fabricated shed, of the type sold cheap all over the country, which we put up ourselves over several days.The only from-scratch structure is the compost loo: a simple timber frame on stilts covered in cladding.Simple, but unfortunately not idiot proof – and we have already had to ask a friendly builder to help us sort out some big mistakes we made when building (think roof that leaks and uprights that aren’t straight).As we’re on the side of a hill, we created a level decking platform for the yurt and shed to sit on, for which again we gratefully received some professional help, doing the easy jobs like insulating the yurt floor and covering the structure in decking boards ourselves.

Putting up the yurt

The living space is thus fairly compact, and, while we do have storage elsewhere, we manage to fit pretty much whatever we need in the yurt.We could create a lot more space if we had roll up mattresses that were laid out only at night, or that became a sofa in the day, but for now this arrangement works.The boys and I each have four Ikea cube boxes in a storage unit for all our clothes (Gautam, who has never been a minimalist and has a lot of clothes, keeps his excess in another shed…).Summer living can be light in the UK, winter is much more heavy duty and we are definitely finding it more difficult to fit in all of the winterwear, extra blankets, duvets and hot water bottles, as well as space to dry towels, wet boots etc.A porch at the entrance to the yurt for exactly this purpose is something we talked about but never did.We have a trunk for all our books and magazines, most of which are from the library or borrowed so not permanent.And the boys have one tuck box each.In the house with its plethora of bedrooms they had their own room, not for sleeping, just for their stuff.As a result their stuff expanded exponentially. When I did a big clear out to move to the yurt, they didn’t even notice what had gone.They can now have as much stuff as they can fit into their tuck box.If they can’t fit something new in, they need to get rid of something old.It works beautifully, most of the time, and I no longer have to nag them daily about tidying up their room.

Building the loo, decking platform and kitchen shed

The convention in the West for each child to have their own bedroom, and for houses to have a separate living area, dining area and kitchen, seems bizarre when you are used to the much more multi-purpose living and multi-person sleeping arrangements in India.As well as necessitating a lot of unnecessary space which must then be heated and maintained, it leads to an accumulation of equally unnecessary stuff.One-room living doesn’t work for all families, but it’s much more convenient to have everything and everyone in one place and it keeps us all very close.

**Mod-Cons**

Having lived for several years completely off grid in Sakleshpur, we know pretty much what we can and can’t survive with here in terms of mod-cons and have created our eco-system accordingly.The main additions are a hoover, and a washing machine/tumble dryer.Laundry in this country was a serious affair in the pre washing machine era.Women (or servants) had a dedicated wash house and a dedicated wash day on which vast vats of water were boiled and clothes scrubbed, put through the mangle and dried. And clothes – and their inhabitants – were certainly not washed every day.There are some hard core off-gridders in the UK who do wash by hand, and many more who just don’t wash their clothes, but all those I know who don’t have a washing machine use a laundrette instead. In India by contrast most of the country gets by quite easily without, hand washing the family’s simple, light-weight clothes daily and sun drying them within a few hours.

Our gas-run camping shower is again an essential luxury. We are neither hardy enough to bathe in cold water throughout the year, nor English enough to settle for one bath a week.

[![](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/img-1353-1.jpg?w=768)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/img-1353-1.jpg)

[![](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/img-8986-1.jpg?w=1024)](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2022/10/img-8986-1.jpg)

Bath time

We are also fortunate to have family (living in modern, conventional homes) close by.The boys visit Granny and Grandpa to have a proper baths, and uncle Tommy to watch the Arsenal games.

I love stripping our lives of unnecessary conveniences.Instead of taking running hot water as a given, we revel in the luxury of it.Heat must be generated rather than just switched on, so it’s never taken for granted.

But even if many people would neither be willing to make the compromises required to ditch their brick and mortar house for this kind of a home, nor be able to see the many advantages to this life, they might be swayed by the cold, hard facts of bills.

**Bills, bills, bills**

Rising energy costs have been headlining for the last couple of months and have contributed to the big mess that is or rather was Liz Truss’ blink-and-you-miss it prime ministership.Truss’ first move upon election was to halt a planned 80% rise in electricity and gas bills, bringing massive relief to households but burdening the government with huge debt and contributing to the pound tumbling.At the same time, the government flip flopped on whether to roll out a public information campaign on reducing energy usage on the basis that people might become too scared to switch the heating on.So instead of getting households to use less electricity, gas and oil, the government is subsidising their continued usage. But not for long as this week’s new Chancellor has now reduced the energy cap guarantee from two years to six months, throwing households and news commentators once again into a blind panic.I watch Uppu come home from his heated classroom and heated school bus in shirtsleeves and hope that our unconventional life will help him grasp the reality of the resources each of us consumes in a way that the standard syllabus lessons on climate change almost certainly never will.In reality, he’ll probably become an oil magnate…

Bills are still going to rise this winter, just not by as much, and by the spring they will be up to the £4,000 p/a mark.Many of those who go off grid or embrace van life do so to avoid both council tax and these bills, which were hefty even before energy prices started to skyrocket earlier this year.The cost of living has become so high in the UK that those wishing to pursue alternative careers and lifestyles find it almost impossible to do so while living in a conventional house.Hence the popularity of tiny homes, often mounted on a trailer so technically mobile which helps them evade planning laws; house boats; all manner of bus/van/lorry conversions; cabins in the woods; and shepherds huts and yurts (although increasingly both now more popular with glampers than hard-core off gridders).

In a cold climate like this, heating is the biggest energy sink.And the bigger your structure the more it costs to heat it.The yurt, by virtue of being a small, round space, is extremely efficient to heat.The wood burning stove very quickly brings the temperature up as high as you want, and can be set to burn low for many hours without feeding.Add into the equation the fact that all of the wood we are burning comes from offcuts left over from construction, plus old bits of sheds that we found in the garden, and you have a formula for guilt-free heating.No tussle between eco-conscience and shivering children when deciding whether to switch on the oil-fed radiators in the house.No dreading the testing of the oil tank to see when we will have to order the lorry to come and fill it with hundreds of pounds worth of heating oil.We can crank up the heat to Indian temperatures, strip off to t shirts and open the window.What decadence…

Certainly it would be possible to live in the yurt with very little outlay for utilities.To give you some idea:

- Heating: with a big of leg work it would be easy to heat the yurt
  throughout the year on offcuts, scraps, logs from trees and branches
  that need to be felled and so on, ie: for free.By comparison heating
  the house takes about 2,500 – 3,000 litres of oil a year, at current
  prices around £2,500 – £3,000. - Hot water: it was so hot this summer we mainly had cold showers, but
  we have an instant gas-powered camping shower for when we do want hot
  showers.In three months we still haven’t emptied one £50 cylinder. - Cooking: even with an old inefficient camping stove and sky-high gas
  prices we have used only about £60 worth of cooking gas over three
  months.We are now cooking the big daily pot of sambar/daal on top of
  the woodburning stove. - Electricity: We use solar lights (although they are fairly unreliable
  and often very dim) so the only electricity in the yurt and kitchen is
  an extension cable we use to charge our phones and to hoover once in a
  while. We also have access to a washing machine and tumble dryer which
  we use perhaps twice or thrice a week, plus a fridge (for dairy, but
  not required now that it’s cold).By comparison, the bill for the
  house is now about £170 a month. - Water: we have one tap, in the kitchen shed, which is run off a garden
  hose, and the same hose also supplies the camping gas shower; both
  could easily be run off our rainwater barrels if we installed a 12
  volt pump.We then have two large 180 litre drums for cold showers
  and for hand washing and teeth brushing.These can be filled by the
  hose or by rain.We probably fill these on average once a fortnight
  so that’s 260 litres.No one has a long leisurely shower because it’s
  outdoors and power shower it ain’t. The boys sometimes have a bath by
  filling a gardening trug with hot water.So if we get our rainwater
  system sorted, with filtration for drinking water, and if England
  reverts to its customary all-year-round rain, we could easily use
  rainwater alone.
- Waste: Our compost loo – built as a tree-bog – need never be emptied
  and works brilliantly except when the roof leaks… And drain water from
  the sink and shower is diverted off to trenches and hedges.So
  there’s no need for any sewerage or septic tank.The house water
  bill, which includes mains sewerage charges, comes to about £90 a
  month. - Internet: we can’t get wifi here so we use our mobiles and a basic
  plan of £8 a month has been all we need.The house wifi costs about
  £40 a month.

There are some definite advantages of the back-to-basics lifestyle in a temperate rather than tropical region, not least of which is that you can go to the loo in the middle of the night without having to switch the light on and check for snakes.Instead of worrying about predatory animals though, off-gridders here have nightmares about neighbours grassing them up to the council.But it is the climate that makes life hard.I have a friend who lives with her family on a boat in Portland Harbour.They never intended to spend the colder months in this country, but work and money constraints mean that this is the second winter they’ll be anchored in harbour with no source of heat (log burners on a boat are too risky), no insulation and an awful lot of damp thanks to the wooden sides of the boat sitting in the cold British sea.It’ll be worth it for the times they can spend travelling around the world later, but for now it’s very challenging. Over the winter, many van dwellers look for house sitting jobs or stay with relatives for the coldest, wettest months.A friend who has just moved into a converted bus with her husband and three children and is already finding the howling coastal wind and mud surrounds a problem.The only yurt-dwelling family we know has spent five years living all year round in theirs, and I think the wood burner is probably the key to survival in the depths of winter, but with strip washes in front of the fire and a gauntlet of mud to be crossed every time you need the loo it’s still tough.

So I can’t say I’m sad that we will be heading east come November, especially as we are welcoming a third baby into our family come the new year.I would love to birth in our yurt, just not in January…

I hope to soon post a video of the yurt and possibly some more photos if I can persuade Gautam to take them. Watch this space.
