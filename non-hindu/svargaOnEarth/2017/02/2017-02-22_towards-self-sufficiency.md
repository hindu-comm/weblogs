Towards Self Sufficiency

How nice it would be to be reliant only upon the village where you live, or even better your own land. How nice, I have often thought in the last couple of years,and left it at that.

Things have unexpectedly changed recently. Gautam, who normally loads up the car each Friday with the necessities from Bangalore (both bits and bobs from home that we need as well as luxuries such as Yakult and makhana), is travelling a lot at the moment and won’t be able to come to the farm for almost the whole of March. And I have had it with trips into Sakleshpur; I managed to reverse into an Ertiga after a chokingly dusty and exhausting few hours in the jeep on market day last week. In a neat reversal it is now shopping that has become a difficult and arduous task; whereas plucking vegetables from our garden or making dish scrubbers out of dry coconut tops couldn’t be easier. And for the first time in 14 years Gautam gave me a haircut this weekend, much better than going to the hairdresser especially as there’s no mirror to fuel your vanity/anxiety.

I haven’t yet renounced money though. A quick review reveals that we are still very much dependent on the local and global economy:

**Food and Drink**

I have been ordering organic fruit and veg, as well as staples such as millet rice, from our local organic store in Bangalore and getting Gautam to bring it out here but this seems increasingly ludicrous. Yes it is nice to know that the food you’re eating is chemical-free but right now local is more important than organic. I’d rather source rice from the paddy farmers all around us, and do vegetable swaps with our neighbours. We do eat a lot of fruit and for that I am almost totally reliant on fruit vendors in Sakleshpur, and the generosity of the houses we visit, but hopefully that will change once our many fruit saplings start to come on tap. Ultimately our diet would I hope be shaped by what we can grow and what is available locally. Although that would mean giving up dark chocolate…

We use 20 litre Bisleri cans for drinking water after many attempts to filter the muddy kere water. A well of some kind is high on our to-do list and hopefully then we would be able to ditch the cans.

We cook either with wood that is collected from dead trees on our land, or with the plentiful sun, although of course the stoves for both themselves were purchased. We do also still buy natural firelighters (wax coated wood shavings) at great cost from Amazon.co.uk and my family bring them out when they come. This is patently ridiculous but after seeing how people use diesel to start fires here we were pretty desperate. I’m thinking of trying to make wax-soaked coconut fibre firelighters or something similar. We’ve tried dried orange peels but they aren’t good at starting a fire.

**Cleaning**

In Bangalore, we were buying – and often spending a fortune on – things like toothpowder, organic soaps, shampoos and conditioners, and virgin cold-pressed oils as moisturisers. And similarly biodegradable floor wash, loo cleaner and dishwash powder. Fortunately I recently started making most of these products at home and, with the help of our neighbour’s electricity-powered blender (the bicycle blender isn’t quite up to these tasks), I reckon I can manage to keep that going here. Most of the ingredients I need are locally available (shikakai, reeta, coffee) or in plentiful supply on the farm (orange peel, ash). I haven’t yet found a good solution for floor and loo washing though, so suggestions welcome. Baking soda is available but only in tiny plastic packets which generate so much waste. Vinegar is also a bit of a speciality item. Traditionally people had cow dung floors (which we have in the kitchen and elsewhere) so there was no washing required. I’m also not sure how to make our regular liquid soap – normally I liquify organic biodegradable soaps. I have been told though that the old-style local soap is made of peanut flour and soapnut and available for Rs 10 a bar so that sounds promising. And maybe I can also use that for washing clothes. I am now on my second-to-last bar of the organic clothes washing soap from Bangalore which is at least semi effective in getting the dirt out. And speaking of washing clothes…

**Clothes**

Last year one of the two things I really missed out here was the washing machine. I’m proud to say that I no longer send dirty clothes back to Bangalore, and have been managing to wash (if not actually get clean) everything here. Indeed we now have a new washing stone and I have even attempted sheet washing. I wouldn’t say I’ve mastered the art, but I’m getting better and Uppu is throwing himself into it. Two tips for would-be washing machine renouncers living outdoor lives with small children and dogs: get rid of all your light-coloured clothes and linen (ours have become dog towels), and encourage everyone to wear the least amount of clothing possible – I aim for just one pair of shorts for Uppu (who really needs chuddies/pants?) with an optional t shirt. I think with envy of those hunter gatherers in their loincloths.

We have just three to four sets of clothes each here although I do keep some better clothes for times when we have to look vaguely presentable. If we were living like this long term, we’d need to re-stock our wardrobes or get busy with a needle and thread which I do eventually hope to do.

**Medical**

I’ve written earlier about trying to become self-sufficient as far as health is concerned. We have planted a medicinal herb garden, and we use aloe vera, turmeric and honey a lot. We also have a basic first aid kit and some homeopathic and ayurvedic medicines. Most of the time this is all we need but twice last year Gautam was really ill and we had no option but to go back to Bangalore. The cavalier doctors in Sakleshpur were even worse than the ones in the city, and the home remedies weren’t effective enough.

We have no idea what to do when a dog is injured or sick, and recently Jaini, our cow, died because of a gastric ulcer despite all the medicine we gave her. So yes this is still a massive dependency.

**Entertainment**

Uppu has a beautifully painted small trunk, a Christmas present from his Chinnamma, in which he stores all of his books, colouring pencils and puzzles. This forms about 10% of his total paraphernalia – the rest of which is sitting in Banglore. He has his cycles and there are swings in the round house, but no toys here at all. When his friends come they all dig out seashells from the sand piles or create Ganapati puja shrines with rocks and dirt and flowers.

I do love to read here on quiet evenings when Uppu is asleep, and crave good novels. I also use my Kindle quite a bit, after loading onto it things like solar cooking manuals. We also all enjoy music, and most often it’s the recorded type, although we’ve been lucky to have had some wonderful musicians also.

**Housing**

Our initial accommodation – tents – seemed ecologically sound and did us very well for a year. Once they started to break though we realised the limitations of using materials that neither we nor anyone local could repair. Indeed our most beloved tent was brought out here from England and when that tore last year we were faced with the astronomical cost of getting the relevant spare part or just retiring it. The shipping containers, where we and visitors currently stay, are not exactly local either (although we bought them from Mysore) but at least don’t need repairing. Our mud buildings on the other hand are wonderful: about 90% of the materials and labour we use are sourced from within a 10km radius; maintenance will be limited to the odd earthen plaster and whitewash; and we haven’t even needed any specialists except for a welder and mason who both live very close – no architect, project manager, contractor, plumber, electrician…

**Tools and Materials**

We depend heavily on the Sakleshpur hardware stores for all of our tools (although here you buy only the metal bit, and then create a handle from a piece of wood), cement, lime, steel, Mangalore tiles, hosepipes, mesh, red oxide paint, nails and so on. That I don’t see changing, although with mud building the need for materials is dramatically reduced. I am also now trying to ensure we don’t buy any plastic where steel or aluminium is an option – buckets, plates, cups. Plastic just breaks and then has to be thrown away. A good example recently was an expensive manual juicer (an American brand but sold in India) which broke and had to be chucked. Gautam then bought another one, which was imported from the US, which broke on the second use. Anyone know of a metal juicer?

**Waste**

Being self-sufficient isn’t just about what we consume, it’s also about the waste we produce. I am of waste-not-want-not stock and I love the fact that food here is either eaten by us, visitors, dogs, buffaloes, ants or put int the compost pit. Our composting loos produce no waste except for sanitary waste – and for that too we are trying to gently persuade guests to use things like cloth nappies and menstrual cups. There is though a fair amount of plastic packaging, especially when people bring lots of snacks and ready-to-eat food, which again we try to discourage. And there is also construction and farm waste, old gunny sacks, bits of metal, plastic sapling covers and so on. Much of what I would have considered waste in Bangalore is reused here partly because it’s so difficult to buy things and partly because there is no dustbin pickup. I found out the other day that waste disposal in both Sullakki and Sakleshpur involves a large trench, and that the one in Sakleshpur is right on the bank of the Hemavati. At least in Bangalore there is some sort of recycling although of course much just goes into landfills; we will continue to take as much as we can back to the city. And thanks to our many fires (cooking, hot water, camp) we are able to burn paper, cardboard, areca nut plates and other such things which we would have otherwise had to put in the dustbin.

**Communication and Information**

There is no wifi here. My BSNL phone gets a fairly weak signal, just enough to allow me to send and receive Whatsapp messages. And that is it. No email, no browsing, no YouTube, no ‘Oh I need a compass, I’ll just download an app on my phone.’ To get internet access, I travel about 10km into the centre of Sakleshpur and then either find a table in an idli hotel or, more often, balance my laptop on the bonnet of the jeep in the blazing sun, hotspot it from my phone, and try to send emails that I’ve already drafted or copy and paste important messages that have come in so I can read them properly later. It’s not easy and it’s not fun and thus I only do what I absolutely have to do, with the small added indulgence of these blog posts because I enjoy writing them.

That means that instead of emailing or messaging someone, I now just call them – much nicer and quicker, although the mobile signal here is often so bad that conversations are difficult. Instead of buying unusual things (eg: flexible hosepipe) online, I try to get them in Sakleshpur or find a local equivalent. Instead of exchanging endless messages with homeschooling groups and other parents trying to arrange playdates, and then travelling hours through the Bangalore traffic, we just walk up to the village in the evening and Uppu plays with his friends while I relax. Instead of googling ‘home remedies for insect bites on child’, I show them to others and seek their advice. Instead of looking up how to build earthbag arches on YouTube, I read and re-read the relevant chapter in the one book I happen to have on the subject, think it through, discuss with others here and then give it my best shot. My problem-solving ability has slowly begun to grow after almost withering away due to disuse. I am often forced to think about how to do something, then proceed by trial and error, rather than just relying on someone else’s guidance.

Yes much of what we have done here could not have happened without the internet. I would never have heard of earthbag building. Gautam would never have been able to source such good solar lights locally. And this blog, and all the wonderful people and projects it has connected us with, would not exist. The internet is an amazing resource but I for one had become too reliant on it and it feels good to be more independent.
