It’s That Time Again

The dry season is upon us and summer is round the corner. We no longer shiver ourselves to sleep in our metal box and the cold crystal clear sunrises have been replaced with muggier mists and the return of ibbani, the ear-pleasing Kannada word for dew.

And despite deciding we would not build anything. at. all. until at least the end of 2017, once again we find ourselves irresistibly drawn to roll up our trousers and start stomping mud. (For photos and posts from last year’s projects click [here](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2016/05/05/earthbagging-in-photos/)and [here](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2016/03/28/project-earthbag/))

We have toyed with the idea of building ourselves a mane or home of some kind for a while. Others might even advise starting with the house before wading into outbuildings and communal spaces. Somehow it never seemed important and anyway we weren’t sure what we wanted to do or where. Now though the time has come to at least create a one-room cottage where we can have a bit more of a permanent set up, and we have just a few months before the monsoon so no time to lose. For the adventurous and experienced mud builders among you, we hope to experiment with glass-bottle-filled arches, built-in cob furniture, frescoes and possibly even a reciprocal roof this time.

We will thus be earthbagging most probably through February, March and April. Uppu and I will be here almost all of that time and would welcome friends, visitors, volunteers and anyone who is interested and would like to participate in some way or another. We now have two elephant-proof guest rooms as well as our state of the art Western-style compost loo, three dogs, two swings and a kitchen fully equipped with all (off-grid) mod-cons.

Hope to see many of you soon, and please call or message me on my mobile – don’t send emails/FB messages etc as internet access is still extremely limited, thankfully.
