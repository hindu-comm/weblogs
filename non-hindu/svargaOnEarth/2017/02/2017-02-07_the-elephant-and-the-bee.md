The Elephant and The Bee

![img-20170206-wa0003](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/img-20170206-wa0003.jpg?w=656)

Last weekend we found ourselves admiring elegant Siddi homes deep in the deciduous forests of central Karnataka. It was vaguely surreal to see members of this African-origin tribe living in typical Western-Ghat fashion and speaking Kannada with a distinct lilt.

We were there at the kind invitation of the [Wildlife Research Conservation Society](http://wrcsindia.org/) which has been working on improving human-elephant relations. This area, around the town of Yellapur, falls in an elephant migratory corridor. For four to five months of the year crops here at at high risk of damage by these travelling elephants. We met one farmer whose entire crop of paddy last season was destroyed by them. As many of these families live on encroached forest land they are not entitled to any compensation from the government. Not surprisingly, anti-elephant sentiment was running fairly high.

The WRCS’s program officer here, Ravi, has changed all this. In the last year he has persuaded farmers to adopt two simple measures: a fence made of bee hives, and a simple home-made trip wire. The trip wire acts as an early warning system but the siren is very rarely activated; once the elephants become aware of the bee hives they never even get as far as the trip wire. The farmer who lost his crop last season has had no elephant encroachment at all this time round.

It was the natural log bee hive fence that drew us here. I first heard of this concept from a friend who is into natural beekeeping in England. The promise of both elephant-free land plus a supply of wild honey was exciting but we didn’t get very far with the idea in Sakleshpur: bees are kept in boxes, we were told, and no they won’t keep elephants away. So I was much encouraged when I heard about the project in Yellapur which had taken inspiration from Lucy King’s successful [‘Elephants and Bees’ project](http://elephantsandbees.com/) in Kenya.

The concept is simple: hang home-made log bee hives at 10-15 metre intervals along your perimeter. Attract wild bees to inhabit them (in fact you can fill alternate ones only so that every second hive is a dummy) by smearing bees wax and cinnammon on the inside of the log. Provide some food to encourage the bees to stay there during the monsoon, when a lack of flowers generally drives them to seek pollen elsewhere. Check on them once in a while and harvest honey when ready, and that’s it. No cleaning or other maintenance. No expensive equipment. And best of all no elephants. And because the hives simply deter the elephants, unlike electric fences and firecrackers which irritate and anger them, human-elephant conflict is also reduced. Chattisgarh, which sees an elephant-related casualty every day, recently sent a team down to learn the technique. And any expense incurred on building the bee hive fence is quickly recouped in the honey and wax harvested, about 4 litres and 1 kg respectively per hive each year.

I hope to start experimenting with our first hive over the next few days and will report back here. In the meantime, if anyone is facing elephant issues and would like to learn more I can put you in touch with the WRCS team.
