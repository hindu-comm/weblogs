Brot

![DSC_0089](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/dsc_0089.jpg?w=656)Germans love their bread and within 24 hours of welcoming our first Workaway volunteers – Fabrice and Misha, two Germans travelling from Madurai to Delhi in an auto – we were treated to a German campfire classic, stockbrot or stick bread. Make regular bread dough (flour, yeast, water and salt), let it rise for an hour, then make thin snakes and wrap them round a bark-stripped stick. Hold the stick over the fire and soon you have the most delicious fresh bread spirals.

So when I mentioned my idea of building a wood-fired bread and pizza oven, both Fabrice and Misha jumped at the prospect. With the help of *Build Your Own Earth Oven*, the cob oven bible according to online reviews and which Misha read at least five times cover to cover, the two attacked the project with a zeal for perfection and precision that I cannot but characterise as German.

What promised to be a weekend job ended up taking almost two weeks, and the pair’s day of departure – to resume their auto tour of India – was daily postponed. The result though was certainly worth it. A cob oven more carefully executed I cannot imagine.

What follows is a brief description of the process, along with some photographs that Fabrice, a professional videographer (lucky that), took. \[connectivity even worse than usual after I smashed my phone and then lost the sim so photo diary will have to follow later, especially as the photos are heavy heavy heavy\] I would though highly recommend buying the book, not only for the invaluable detail it provides but also because it includes a chapter on how to make sourdough. I’ve also tried to give a rough idea of the cost and time involved. We had almost all material readily available so spent a grand total of about Rs 750 on the entire thing. Obviously though if you don’t have sand, earthbags, clay, empty beer bottles and so on sitting around, it will cost a bit more.

**1. The Platform**

they used two courses of gravel earthbags followed by two courses of mud earthbags directly on the ground (no foundation) to raise the oven to a good working height. small bits of barbed wire were laid in between each course.

cost – we re-used some old earthbags that we had packed and not used

time – one day’s work

**2. Insulating Layer**

as they were using earthbags which are plastic and thus flammable they built a 9 inch fireproof layer consisting of a perimeter of reinforced adobe blocks filled with tamped mud

cost – they used blocks we were making for another building so no actual cost

time – ideally build the block perimeter (2 hours) then let it dry until the next morning; then fill with mud (2 hours)

**3. Oven Sub-Floor with glass bottle insulation and dense mud layer**

they did this by building a ring of two courses of regular red bricks (total about 8 1/2 inches high) with a cement mortar

then they packed empty glass bottles in a clay-wood shavings mix (the book says to use building mud but they found that too crumbly so used pure clay, harvested from our kere) of 5 inches height. best to soak the clay in water the day before to make it easier to form the clay-cream.

then they filled the remaining 3 odd inches with the mud-sand mix which forms the inner layer of the oven (1:2 mud to sand ratio). best to soak the mud in water two days in advance. once all lumps have dissolved, drain off the excess water and then mix with sand a day before using. cover with a tarp to retain moisture. mix should be reasonably stiff.

cost – bricks – Rs 200; wood shavings – Rs 20 for a gunny sack of it; sand was left over from another construction project

time – 2 hours to build the brick ring, then a day to dry

4-6 hours to create the bottle and clay-wood shaving layer, then the rest of the day to dry

2 hours to fill in the mud-sand 3 inch layer, no need to let it dry before moving onto the next step

**4. Lay Hearth Floor**

we bought machine-made bricks with flat surfaces and edges to ensure the grid of bricks fit together perfectly and the oven floor is smooth so grit and ash doesn’t catch. planning and fitting them together (with no mortar) required a lot of patience and precision.

cost – 17 machine-made bricks at Rs 10 per brick

time – 3-4 hours

**5. Arch Entrance**

they created an arch to make the entrance stronger, and more attractive. first they got a form made at the local carpenter, then planned the placement of bricks with a test on the ground. then they built it on the hearth floor using pebbles in between each brick and a mud-sand mortar (1:3 mud to sand ratio).

cost – 10 machine-made bricks at Rs 10 per brick, arch form labour and materials Rs 200

time – full day including trip to carpenter and planning

**6. Sand Dome**

they created a dome on the hearth floor with moist sand, and covered it with damp newspaper

cost – sand we already had, as above

time – 2 hours and then you need to move straight onto the mud-sand layer before the sand and newspaper dry out

**7. First Layer: Dense Oven Mud**

using the same mix as earlier for the oven floor, they carefully built up rows of mud-sand balls and merged them to cover the dome. this took an incredibly long time.

cost – only the sand as above

time – about a day and a half, then let dry for at least a day

**8. Second Layer – Insulation**

using the same mix as earlier for the oven floor, they built a 4-5 inch thick layer on top of the mud-sand layer

cost – three huge gunny sacks of wood shavings costing Rs 60 in total

time – most of a day

**9. Remove The Arch Form and Sand**

time – 20 minutes

**10. Cover with a Fine Finish Plaster**

we plan to plaster in a week or so when the insulating layer has dried out completely; in the meantime we are already using the oven

It took a couple of firings to get the oven decently hot (the wet mud and clay need to dry out), but on the third firing Fabrice and Misha produced two perfectly baked loaves and banana bread. Still working on the perfect pizza though…

We were also lucky enough to host two other volunteers, Soren and Susana, around the same time. They helped us out in many ways, including painting our guest rooms, and were a great couple to have around. I am totally sold on the volunteer concept. It gives us a ready-made community with a real mix of people, and makes the running of this place much more practical. We also now have an awesome kere swing…
