Wild: Part One

Read is not the right verb for [Jay Griffiths’ *Wild: An Elemental Journey*](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/54050/wild/). Her words are like the wind, at times howling madly, blasting all in its path, crude and violent; at times soft and sonorous and seductive. *Wild* is a song disguised as a book, a gloriously mad song that demands to be sounded. No one could better celebrate wildness, the glorious birthright forsaken by almost all, and shake us out of the grey shadow lives we live.

Suffering from depression, Jay grabs at a lifeline offered her in the form of an invitation to join an expedition to the Amazon. There, she drinks a lot of ayahuasca (one night she becomes a jaguar’s apprentice, terrifying readers in the Bodleian and RadCam, bastions of the dry bookish knowledge of her past), well known for its ability to heal depression, and immerses herself in the fecundity of the jungle.

The wild landscapes and peoples she explores here in the jungle, and thereafter in ice, sea, desert and mountain have all been desecrated by the white man. And with them have died the knowledge they possessed, a knowledge far greater than anything that has been replaced it, as well ultimately as that most essential of blessings, to be at one with the world in which we live. Missionaries, explorers, empire builders, logging and mining companies have seen these resplendent wildernesses, habitats complete with their ancient inhabitants, as wastelands hateful, evil even, which must be tamed and exploited. And in the process they have indeed successfully turned these living landscapes into wasteland, tilled or pastured to sterility, dug and cut and polluted to barren-ness, and denuded of the people who loved and nurtured it.

These indigenous people have in turn become some of the saddest, most desperate communities on earth. Jay talks of younger generation Inuits who are no longer able to even walk out of their settlements because they have grown up without the requisite knowledge of this challenging landscape (thanks, of course, to the schooling so generously thrust upon them by good Christian folk). If you don’t know which ice is strong enough to hold your weight, or when an ice plate might break off and be blown out to sea, to venture out is death. Unable to access the wilderness that would once have salved heated minds, particularly those of adolescents, people succumb to mental wilderness. Here, among the modern’s worlds gifts of booze, glue-sniffing, ice-cream and tv, dwells insanity. And ultimately suicide.

To Jay, the destruction of land and people is largely the responsibility of Christians and men, and, mostly, Christian men. She despises the explorers who strove to penetrate and conquer virgin land, gloating over their triumphs like rapists over their victims. The white man wanted to measure, to organise and to control these wild lands. In Jay’s charged language, such seemingly benign things as watches and maps are revealed as grotesque tools of subjugation. (Have we ever stopped to think why Greenwich is the centre of the time world, such that even overweening America is reduced to GMT-5?) And naturally such civilised men tamed the savages of these lands with their best yokes: schools, God, and eventually that most civilising of influences, consumerism.

“Around the world…I’ve seen missionaries at work, busy converting people not so much to Christianity as to a specifically middle-class capitalism, taming the spirited *modus vivendi* of wild places into a tepid, orderly, punctual, fenced suburbia, every woman a housewife, every man a nine-to-five employee, every child a clean white blouse off to school to learn how to be a good Euro-American consumer.”

The losers ultimately are not just the Australian aboriginals and the Native Americans, but every single one of us leading this deadening modern life.

“We are wild but tamed by television, controlled by Captain Clock, hemmed in by routine and obedience to petty convention. The more suffocatingly enclosed we are, the louder our wild genes scream in misery, aggression, anger and despair. In wildness is our self-willed, self-governing freedom, and such wild freedom blossoms within us, bubbles over with an anarchic ivresse of feeling. And we glint when the wild light shines.”

What have we lost?



And are we still so blind as to not see it?
