Jungle Farm Seeks Like-Minded Souls

We have spent two years assembling an infrastructure of sorts: three shipping container rooms, two compost loos, two bathrooms, two earthbag houses (one for us to live and the other for everyone to hang out) and one outdoor off-grid kitchen, complete with wood-fired bread and pizza oven. It’s pretty much all anyone could ever want, although we do still have a few projects on the anvil, including that essential jungle gym.

Even more important though now is some inhabitants, preferably of the human (and/or canine) variety. Yes we want people, lots of them. And to that end we cordially invite you to visit, stay, co-habit, find your calling, realise your life potential or just enjoy maadi.

This might interest you if you are (tick all that apply):

– toying with the idea of life beyond the city

– braving (or thinking about braving) the great unknown that is not-sending-your-children-to-school

– an eco-entrepreneur

– bored to tears with Bangalore’s traffic

– a drummer with no place to practice

– into barefoot running

– spiritually and/or yogically inclined

– a labrador

– in need of a cabbage-patch to tend

– re-wilding

– having a mid-life crisis

– other, please state \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
