Wild: Part Three

Returning to the wild has always been only one half of the picture. We have long since recognised that we, and our children, need nature in its fullest sense, nature complete with the people who have always been a part of it.

Both Gautam and I are no longer living in the well-defined communities we grew up in, and in which our parents still live. Uppu is growing up with no easily definable community at all, no easily definable nationality, culture or religion even to tie him down. In the city, it is fairly easy to create a circle of like-minded friends and for some that becomes a strong community. Out in the sticks though it is difficult. We will never belong in the tightly-knit village fabric of Sullakki. We can make friends and live alongside our neighbours, as indeed we do, but we will always be totally different in a society where everyone else is almost identical in the way they dress, eat, make a living, pass the time, worship, marry and bring up their children.

We could encourage others more similar to us in background and outlook to come and live with us, or nearby. Quite apart from the impact this might have on the village or area (and we have of course already changed things, for good or for bad, in Sullakki by choosing to buy land and live here), it is not at all easy to create such a community. Our families are not likely to come and live here. And many-a-times the friends who buy land communally and live together fall out, badly. We are too used to our nuclear existence, to our sovereignty over our houses and our lives. In our modern insistence on independence and ownership we have perhaps lost the knack of living with other humans in a tribe.

Thus perhaps the best option is to instead create a transient tribe. A tribe of visitors, long and short term, who bring companionship, if not community. Travellers who stop with us for a time on their journey, literal or metaphoric.

And that brings me back, yet again (the quote below was too compelling but this really is the last post, promise), to *Wild*. For most of human existence, we have been nomadic. We have roamed as a community the land upon which we lived. But with the settled existence that agriculture and animal husbandry brought, nomads become an aberration, and a threat. And ever since, organised society has been trying to stamp nomadism out, to force these vagrants and vagabonds to stop moving and conform. They have, says Jay, largely succeeded and yet, while nomads are all but extinct, our wanderlust remains:

“*Walk*. The drum begins. Follow it. Follow the drums of thunder. Follow the sun. Follow the stars at night as they lean their long slant down the far side of the sky. Follow the lightning and the open road. Follow your compulsion. Follow your calling. Follow anything except orders and habit…

For the settled, in their suburbs, steeped in that stagnant and tepid sink, time is sluggish with routine: a bleary sunrise and a blearier sunset. There, the past is framed in a fixed photographic grin, and the future is tamed with a pension plan. Nothing in nature is suburban…Nothing compares to the grotesque infantilism of the suburbs, sucking the dummy of the supermarket and every week squirting out the waste into giant plastic nappies, the bulging trash bags by the closed gate. In the suburbs, the alertness of all wild creatures is degraded into neurotic curtain-twitching. The curiosity of all animals degenerated into bingeing on Sky News. Queasily obedient, here life is just a dull lull, tethered to a bungalow, an index-linked nap between two sleeps.”

The conundrum though for those of us who choose to follow the drum is that if we do so, we do so alone. To put down roots in the modern context, especially for those who were born without them, is to settle and become a part of a community, a community which is nowadays by its very nature stationary. To roam is to forfeit that community and court loneliness.
