Ode to An Indian SUV

This may not seem like the obvious place to extol the virtues of an SUV, but I cannot resist placing on record the wonders of Gautam’s large diesel-powered truck.

The capacious Mitsubishi Pajero Sport has so far brought here, in vague chronological order,

– a medley of tents, camping furniture, food, gas stoves and chulas

– a cane chair-table-sofa set

– an ancient table which survived the journey only to have its legs knocked off as Gautam reversed into the kitchen roof

– jerry cans and drums of water for us and all our guests to wash, cook and drink – daily, for several months

– the kitchen sink, literally, plus almost all of our kitchen paraphernalia

– four heavy mattresses and two trunkfuls of bedsheets and blankets

– all kinds of saplings, creepers, medicinal herbs and flowering plants from all over the place

– several large, and two enormous, steel and wooden trunks

– adults and children’s bicycles by the dozen, back and forth

– a bootful of granite slabs from a friend’s kitchen refurbishing

– five heavy wooden doors (excluding the two which were lost somewhere on the highway)

– several hundred bricks

– the remnants of our flat in Bangalore, which is now empty save for clothes, pots and pans

– busloads of adults, children and dogs, as well as, several times, a crow and a turtle

and much of it in heavy rain on a mud track so slippery and treacherous that no other vehicle, save the jeep, ever attempts it.

I doubt if any other Pajero owner in Bangalore has got quite the same amount of use out of their car as we have, especially as most are terrified at the thought of a mud splash on their chrome wheels. Certainly the Mitsubishi service guys are routinely amazed at the scars the car bears, before getting down to work on the rear-view camera which was smashed by a tree stump or the front bumper which was busted by a sideways skid onto a gate-post.

Still, scratched, dented, smelling of either wet dog or segane and littered with peanut shells, banana skins, hay, broken tiles and muddy clothes, it lumbers loyally on, doing freight journey after journey, waiting perhaps for the moment when we pack our bags for a continental road trip with roof-top tent and boot-loaded kitchen.
