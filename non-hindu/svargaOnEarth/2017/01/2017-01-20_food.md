Food

The relationship between food and health has engrossed (harassed, obsessed) me for at least a year. I have looked at it from the perspective of what humans historically ate, of the impact of genetics, of the role location plays. I have listened to the views of conscious hunters as well as those of fruitarians. I have tried, and mainly failed, to find some universally accepted and applicable ideas, standards and rules. And I have naturally got entangled in the endless -ism debates.

We live in a city mired in its own waste in the middle of a rapidly industrialising tropical country. Disease is rife. The medical industry is a racket. Doctors massively over-prescribe medicines, especially antibiotics, and are very often unprofessional, contradictory and/or just plain wrong. Hospitals focus mainly on how to squeeze the last rupee out of you. And alternative medicine is unregulated and very hit and miss. We try to avoid having to go to any kind of medical professional except in the case of physical injury, which means we need to not get ill. And the factors affecting health that we can most easily control are diet and lifestyle; sadly we can change neither our genes nor the traffic.

In search of the holy grail of optimal diet and health, we have tried all kinds of things, from juicing to fermenting to fasting. There have been (unintentional, just that no one wanted any) dairy-free months. Gautam and I have even managed to do a week without salt. I avoided cooked food altogether for a couple of months. Some things seemed to work and some didn’t. And I am slowly coming to the conclusion that the ultimate solution doesn’t exist. Kombucha, wheatgrass, bone-broth – such things are feted as the dietary answer to humanity’s woes. They’re not. They are great for certain people at certain times. But the bete-noires of the health industry – milk, wheat, fat – can also be invaluable for certain people at certain times. Things I took as a given – processed food is bad; don’t drink milk with fruit – no longer seem so clear cut, especially once you take into account things like the role of the mind. Going vegan, raw or fruit-only might be the best thing that ever happened to a yoga teacher hoping to take his practice to the next level, but could prove disastrous for his infant nephew. I believe now that there is no ideal diet, no good and bad foods, no hard and fast rules about what to eat when and how.

Instead I’d like to borrow an idea I heard on a [podcast](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/movement-ecology-katy-bowman-121) between two thinkers I really like, Daniel Vitalis and Katy Bowman: being connected to your food. For me, this means three things: being as involved as possible in the sourcing and preparation of your food; being able to listen to what your body is telling you; and eating mindfully.

**Sourcing and Preparing Food**

Many of us buy all of our food in a shop. Cooking often involves emptying a packet of ready-shelled peas (either by a factory or by your maid depending on where you live) into some boiling water, or microwaving a ready-made meal (again either courtesy of M&S or your domestic help). This lack of involvement in what we eat has several repercussions:

The first is that we have very little knowledge or appreciation of what goes into producing what we consume. We are outraged at the price of tomatoes but if you’ve ever tried to grow them you’ll know they are worth their weight in gold. Our children know more clothing brands than they do vegetables and have very little conception of how their hamburger is related to Peppa Pig, or even the real pig they see in a field. And we are liberal to the extent of being wasteful with things that until recently were a hard-earned luxury: butter, salt, nuts, meat.

The second is that we eat too much. The money we earn in the city is more than enough to cover our weekly groceries so we can afford to buy and eat more than we need. We have cars and home delivery so we needn’t physically carry home the food we consume (or very often waste), so another potential limitation on quantity is lifted. And we have a plethora of ways to store food so that we only need to do the supermarket shop once a week rather than having to venture out into the wild for every meal.

This leads us to the third repercussion, the outsourcing of movement, as Katy Bowman puts it. We no longer have to hunt, forage or farm our food; nor do we have to hand-pound the pepper, manually grind the dosa batter or knead the bread. Someone else or something else does all of the hard work for us; and it’s worth remembering how many resources go into making and running the machines used, from the blender in our kitchen to the industrial bread oven, as well of course as all of the, mainly non-renewable, fuel required to heat or cool our food. How many people go out, find a dead tree, chop it up and light a fire to make their morning brew? Instead, we go to the gym to get the exercise we would have got if we’d been sourcing and preparing our food ourselves.

Being connected to your food naturally helps us (re-)connect with our bodies thus leading neatly into the second idea:

**Listening to Your Body**

This sounds easy. When you’re full, stop eating. When you crave something, recognise it as a signal that your body needs it and eat it. But most of us eat with our minds not our bodies. We have long ago decided that we don’t like onion and that cashews taste best when roasted with salt, that breakfast must consist of fruit and that semi-skimmed milk is better for us, that lunch is at 1pm and that without three square meals a day we will surely shrivel up and die. We have created a set of guidelines and rules which have so successfully smothered our body’s intuitive sense of what it needs that we can no longer hear it at all. The exception is young children, who haven’t yet taken on all of the emotional, intellectual and cultural baggage that surrounds food, nor had their tastes warped by artificial flavours and too much salt and sugar, nor been influenced by ads for Kinder Eggs. That is why, I suspect, children eat only peanuts and ghee one day, nothing the next and then a ton of fruit the day after – if their parents allow them that is. We should learn from them, not they from us.

We also need to learn to read the signals our mind and body gives us in response to a particular food, the reactions whether positive or negative we experience immediately after eating, once the meal has been digested and cumulatively over weeks and months of eating a particular way. It is often only by changing our diet that we are able to really notice these reactions and can then start to adjust what, when and how we eat to feel and be well. And this is a constant process, because we and our environments keep changing. So rather than automatically eating cereal for breakfast, salad for lunch and meat and two veg for supper, just because we always have and others around us do, we need to re-assess continuously. We need too keep checking in with ourselves – am I feeling energetic, vital at the moment? how are my teeth, skin and hair (the first indicators of health or sickness in the body)? how often am I getting ill? – and then work out what changes need to be made. This goes not only for food of course but also movement and other lifestyle things such sleep. Exercise regimes, alarms, set working hours – all such things inhibit our ability to listen to our bodies just as much as a strict diet does. Note that if you take \[insert preferred word: mainstream, chemical, allopathic, proper\] medicine, which is designed to stop the symptoms or signs your body is sending you, regularly then I’m guessing it becomes much more difficult to read your body.

**Mindful Eating**

This is something I have learnt from [Dr Achyuthan Eshwar](http://naturopathyoga.org/), a naturopath in Bangalore who has hugely influenced our thinking on food and health over the last year. How many of us really taste what we eat? Often, we have a preconceived notion of how our food will taste, and we relish our mind’s picture rather than the food itself. If you can learn to eat slowly and mindfully, chewing each mouthful many times and preferably with your eyes closed (obviously not something to practice at the next dinner party you go to; thankfully in India people traditionally don’t talk when eating) to allow you full concentration on the taste, texture, smell and sound of what you are eating, and also to experience your body’s reaction to the food, not only will you genuinely enjoy each meal but you will also never overeat or eat something which disagrees with you.

There is also the related idea that the frame of mind with which you eat something is more important than what you eat. Forcing yourself to gulp down an almost undrinkable green smoothie from a smart juice bar probably does you less good mentally and physically than savouring every mouthful of your mother’s deep-fried Diwali special. To really nourish both body and spirit our food should be prepared with love and good intentions and eaten with gratitude, full awareness and joy.

I have dreams of reaching the stage of complete self sufficiency with food: consuming only what we, as a family unit, either grow or forage ourselves, preferably with fuel we have sourced. Right now that consists mainly of green leafy vegetables, and a solar oven we bought on Amazon, so quite a way to go.

Listening to the body and eating mindfully are at first glance much more doable but in my experience they are actually much more difficult, requiring a re-wiring of the brain. I haven’t felt like milk even once in the last year, but if my body craved it would I listen, would I be tuned in enough to hear? And how in the rush of both life and our own minds can we really focus on every single morsel of food we taste, chew, swallow and digest, and continually monitor our body’s overall state of health? It needs to become intuitive, as presumably it always was for our ancestors. Forget the meat vs.green leaves, paleo-chimp-hunter-gatherer debates; it is not what they ate but the state of mind with which they ate and indeed lived that we need to discover and emulate.

———————————–

For what it’s worth this is my current position on the vegetarian/vegan debate: It seems to me that as a species we were originally not vegetarian but probably didn’t eat much animal protein as foraging – which includes bugs and grubs too (I picture our ancestors’ reaction to finding a maggot-riddled apple: yum, added bonus!) – was an easier and more dependable way of obtaining food than hunting, and there was presumably no animal husbandry until the time of agriculture. Abstaining from certain foods, such as meat, has in many cultures been practised for spiritual reasons, as has the related practice of fasting or reducing your food intake in some way. I think both practices can also help hugely in fighting illness and for cleansing and healing, at the physical, psychological and spiritual level. So Homo sapiens is probably a predominantly-vegetarian omnivore, who has at times found abstinence from things like meat to be of great benefit. What is for sure though is that our planet was not designed to support such a quantity of humans eating such a quantity of meat. Either we are going to have to collectively reduce the amount of animal products we consume or ourselves reduce in numbers.

And no I haven’t touched at all here on the ethical angle of meat and animal-product consumption. I think that is an entirely personal choice, and if it over-rides the health angle, as it does for many people including me right now, then fine. Vegetarian, vegan, paleo etc etc evangelising is no different from the religious type and I apologise to all who have in the past been the target of my missionary zeal in this area.
