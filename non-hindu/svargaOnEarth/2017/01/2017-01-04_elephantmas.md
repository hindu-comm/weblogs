Elephantmas

![elmers-christmas](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/elmers-christmas.jpg?w=656)

This beloved Elmer book, one of the handful of festive children’s books we brought with us to Sakleshpur for our first Christmas at the farm, turned out to be rather appropriate. Within 24 hours of arriving, we had reports of elephants (disappointingly regular grey coloured ones) across the paddy at Kudrangi Devasthana. The following week we were startled one morning to hear the sound of large branches being broken off; an elephant was munching on some jungle foliage just a few hundred metres behind our newly constructed earthbag loo. He, or she, was very close to the track that leads into our camp area, the same track that I had walked the previous evening in the dark with Uppu and our three dogs. We climbed up to the top of the container but still couldn’t see anything. \[I subsequently wrote an excited message to several people: ‘Elephant behind the Western loo. Can hear but not see.’ A few hours later a worried text arrived from my father, ‘What’s all this about a blind elephant?’\] That night – alone as Gautam was in Bangalore – was the first time I have felt a little bit scared.

When the ‘ane bandide’ call comes, we are now in the habit of going elephant hunting early the next morning. Armed with Gautam’s iphone, we track the elephants by their enormous footprints in the paddy, their dung and any damaged crop or trees, as well as the varying reports of paddy workers, cowherds and incoherent grandmothers sitting in the early morning sun in their courtyards and try to work out where they are now, how many there are, where they came from and where they went.

It is all exciting stuff, but also dangerous. The only time I ever see people here worried is when there are elephants. Snakes, even cobras, occasion not so much as a raised eyebrow. Chance upon an elephant at night, when they travel, and you stand a high risk of being trampled. An eleven year old boy was killed in just such an incident recently near the Hemavati river, about five kms away. People round here are also not used to elephants. Before the first sighting in April this year they had never been this side. In these last two weeks that we were on the farm, they must have come at least four times, and each time further and further into (for them) unchartered territory, paddy and coffee that people swore would never see elephants and now bear only too much witness to their presence. Apparently, the cutting of the jungle and electric fencing of coffee estates on the Magge side, which is where these elephants come from, has deprived them of food and shelter and driven them over here.

All this has made us take a bit of a raincheck not just on night-time ambles back from the village but also on camping in the meadow. The most important thing is to have lights, or fire, on all night to show that people are living there. Elephants don’t attack but they might just stumble into your camp if it’s not well lit. So Gautam now spends a good half an hour each night carefully placing our solar lights in a circle around our living area, and tents are planted firmly within that circle. We are also planning to convert our storage container into another bedroom for people to sleep in if there are elephants around. Metal just feels safer than canvas, however many lights you have.

I’m planning to talk to some friends who work with elephants to understand how we can live alongside them. One idea someone gave us was to encourage wild bee nests in old trees as that works as a deterrent in Africa. A friend though who has tried this south of Bangalore says that she hasn’t had much success, but that may also be because the neighbours use firecrackers to scare elephants away, leading them to stampede in fright willy nilly. Bees are not much of a deterrent in the face of explosives. Gautam wants to get some heavy duty solar floodlights up. We did build an elephant trench in April, but experienced Keralites laughed when we told them it was a massive 4ft by 6ft. They said they had built one 20ft deep and it still doesn’t stop them.
