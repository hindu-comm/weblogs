Reclamation

Six weeks is all it took. Six weeks of almost no humans or dogs; of no cars, tractors or bikes; of no imposition of steel, brick, cement or even earthbag; of no tilling or planting or weeding. With nothing to curtail, curb or control nature’s fecundity, and enough rain to last most countries a lifetime, she has joyfully spread herself everywhere:

the jungle has grown tall and thick all around, reducing the footprint of our scraggle of structures and returning large areas to their former impenetrable state

the banana saplings and several other precious plants have been all but munched to death by errant cattle

the vegetable garden is now only such in name

our proud Mangalore-tiled roofs and water-proof container bedrooms have sprung leaks left, right and centre

rust has claimed metal; moss and fungus the rest

there are mushrooms and green shoots growing out of the walls and floors

the store room has become a mouse birthing centre, with cosy nests made out of one of our last remaining tents

the clothes that were carefully wrapped in plastic and put into storage for the monsoon are so mouldy I have had to send them all back to be blitzed by Surf in the washing machine

and Uppu has been kept suitably entertained by a string of visitors: birds nesting in various roof eaves; slugs on our plates; a large (pregnant?) frog living in the bathroom; monkeys raiding the kitchen at night; a lost water buffalo charging around the containers; a hare bolting right past our bedroom door, hotly pursued by the dogs; and ants, the tiny black biting ones, all over our bed

Last and best of all, a solitary elephant wandered right past the banana saplings and our new house two nights ago as we slept, leaving a deep footprint in a loose bit of soil in the meadow. As we seek to reclaim, bit by bit, our hard-won space, and to rid our bedroom at least of flora, fauna and the elements, part of me (the part that isn’t trying to sleep in a wet bed) can’t help smiling. Such efforts barely merit nature’s attention; ant and elephant, mould and rust stop for no man. The riotous party will continue, pushed slightly to the periphery perhaps but just as wild as ever. After all, who are we to stop it?

As we were just about to leave for Sakleshpur and to publish this blog post, this dancing abundance of life was brought into sharp relief by the unceremonious suddenness of death. Our five-month-old puppy, Zeeni, fell out of the jeep and hit her head so badly on the metal bumper that she died almost instantly. Death is always and everywhere but still when it strikes so close it hurts.
