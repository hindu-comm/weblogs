Earthbagging on Ecologise.in

The kind people at Ecologise.in have published a detailed how-to series of posts I wrote on earthbagging.

Here they are:

[Part One](http://www.ecologise.in/2017/05/06/earthbag-diaries-1/)

[Part Two](http://www.ecologise.in/2017/05/14/earthbag-diaries-2/)

[Part Three](http://www.ecologise.in/2017/05/22/earthbag-diaries-3/)

[Part Four](http://www.ecologise.in/2017/05/30/earthbag-diaries-4/)

It was an Ecologise workshop we went to in Sirsi about 18 months ago that made unschooling and moving out of the city suddenly achievable, immediate realities for us rather than pie in the sky fantasies for the retired and/or super rich. Many of this varied group of people who are united in their desire to lighten their footprint in the world have since become good friends and mentors. There is [another workshop coming up in Dharwad this month](http://www.ecologise.in/event/ecologise-camp-5/). I would highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking about moving out of the city, unschooling or just leading a lower-impact life.

And the website, which is as interesting and thought-provoking as the man who runs it, Sajai, is well worth a visit in the meantime.
