Summer of Conviviality

Today is the last day of May. We should still have two weeks to go until the monsoon, but it has been raining heavily on and off for a month and the heat has long since gone. The kere has become more invigorating than refreshing, and we no longer linger.

And what a summer it was. When we drove to the farm in the middle of January, I thought Uppu and I might stay for a week or two before heading back to the city. It has now been more than four months and we’ve been back to Bangalore only once, for a rather dazed five days. In the meantime we have built (well almost, as ever it’s taking longer than expected) ourselves somewhere to live, using earthbags and mud blocks, and lived life the way it was designed to be lived: outside, purposeful, surrounded by people and animals and, consequently, happy.

\*\*There are many many more photos but as ever I’m not able to upload them. Gautam’s Facebook page has most of them.\*\*

Thank you to all those who came to stay. We have had about 100 friends, friends of friends, friends of Uppu’s, volunteers, relatives and dogs staying since January. Together we have cooked and eaten and fed (animals and children), walked and talked, swum and swung and sung, watered, planted, cleaned, painted, constructed, assembled, brainstormed, argued, celebrated, and played and played and played. It has been crazy, in a good way, and we have learnt a lot from all of you. Now with the schools reopening here and most foreigners avoiding India like the plague because of the monsoon, the flood of visitors has slowed to a trickle.

Life for us will also change gears. With the hectic construction pretty much behind us, we can settle down to our first proper monsoon here, a time of hibernation in many ways, like the English winter. I’m imaginging plenty of reading, learning how to make sourdough, baking in the cob oven (great way to warm up), exploratory walks, marmalading, muddy puddle splashing, trying to coax some vegetables out of a waterlogged garden, setting up bee hives etc. And hopefully the odd visitor to share some kashayam with as the rain pours down.

For those who are trying to get in touch with us, I have kind of abandoned Facebook and I’m now no longer on Whatsapp after losing my sim card. I do check my email (veansell@hotmail.com) but sometimes not for a couple of weeks, so the best thing is to call or message on 997230 5440. Or get in touch with Gautam who is still connected during the week at least.
