Agriculture

What does the word agriculture conjure up for you? We grew up with happy scenes of sun-ripened cornfields, bright red tractors, contented cows and sheep (little did they or we know where they were headed) and jolly farmers.

For back-to-the-landers and others searching for a way out of civic dystopia, farming is often the answer; as it is, or at least was, to us too. Buy some land, grow some crops, raise some livestock, perhaps sell some of the surplus and thus make a living. This is not agriculture though, people will be quick to tell you, but permaculture. There are no pesticides, no fertilisers, minimal or no machines. It is a way of cultivating the land in a sustainable way, not farming but natural farming.

Is that though an oxymoron? Can there be such a thing as natural farming? Fukuoka perhaps came the closest to it when he suggested we look to the way things grow in the forest and mimic that – ie: we as humans should do nothing and instead let nature do the work.

Lierre Keith, in a recent podcast with my pin-up Daniel Vitalis, states a strong case for agriculture being the most pernicious thing man has ever done. By converting habitats that hosted and fed millions of form of life into plots designed to produce only food and only for humans, we have seriously messed up the world we live in. Indeed she says that farming produced the same amount of carbon up until 1800 as fossil fuels have in the subsequent two centuries. And I’m guessing that most of that pre-1800 farming was similar to the sustainable, natural farming that we are now trying to return to. Sure it is a massive improvement on today’s large-scale, machine-driven agriculture but perhaps not truly sustainable or natural – to us a species, or to the planet as a whole.

The pattern as Lierre sees it goes something like this: A clan starts to try to cultivate the land around them to provide more food security. The newly cultivated earth, still rich, produces a great food surplus which leads to a boom in the population. Such surplus also necessitates storage, and once stored the food needs to be guarded. At the same time, the booming population requires more and more food, which the land the clan currently controls can’t now produce. Thus is born a military, to guard the clan’s own food supplies and also to try to get food from other clans. As the land further depletes, the clan needs must increase its area of control to get more food, or suffer starvation. Enter armies, wars and slaves.

Farming is incredibly hard work, compared to a little light grub-gathering and berry-foraging. That is why humans started to breed draught animals, before the switch to fossil-fuel driven mechanisation. And that is where serfdom comes in. Before industrialisation, you needed several people to cultivate an acre of land. Serfs and slaves provided the obvious solution. When we run out of fossil fuels we will either have to switch back to human-powered farming (and the guys at the top are unlikely to be rolling up their sleeves) or abandon it altogether. Alternative sources of fuel would never be able to run the agro-economy.

So if we were forced, or chose, to abandon farming, how would we feed ourselves? By hunting and gathering, as our ancestors did, say Lierre, Daniel and other rewilders. Of course, seven billion people cannot hunt and gather enough to survive, because this planet was never designed to support so many humans. What Lierre does not really address is the interim solution. How do we feed our enormous population without cultivating land? And if the human race could only return to hunting and gathering when a fraction of its current size, how do we decrease our numbers?
