Wildlife

An elephant discovers our mud pond

Snakes in the house: two harmless but huge rat snakes and the beautiful semi-venomous vine snake. Elephants all over our land: in the coffee plantation, behind the cottage, behind the round house and in the kere. (The lone male who we spotted having a drink and a splash there one afternoon evidently told his mates because that night there was a pool party. We found the life ring ripped off its rope and bobbing in the water, skid marks down the banks, fence posts knocked over and our pump hut pulled apart.)

Scary? In some ways, yes. The word ‘snake’ almost always elicits moderate to severe anxiety in visitors, but when we mention the possibility of elephants people are excited: “Really? Can we go see them?” The local inhabitants by contrast think nothing of snakes, most of which around here are not poisonous, but become very agitated when elephants are reported to be close.

Both reactions are justified. I am sure that there is an innate human fear of snakes. (I would have liked to see whether Theos, who is too small to be conditioned to fear them, is naturally scared or not. But of course when we do have a situation with a snake he is normally being held safely in the arms of an adult who definitely is scared, and thus feeds on that fear. He hasn’t ever faced a snake one-on-one; wild as we like to think ourselves we’re not quite ready for that.) And certainly a bite from a poisonous snake is not a joke. Elephants meanwhile have already killed several people in the area – they are amazingly difficult to spot in the jungle and deaths normally occur when people surprise them – and caused untold damage to crops and property. The forest department sends a band of officers every time they enter an inhabited area to patrol and monitor the elephants’ movements for days. So it’s all pretty serious stuff.

our forest officer friends helping us keep an elephant at bay

For me, it is the encounters with snakes that cause sleepless nights, even when I know they are harmless. Seeing elephants so close at hand has only filled me with awe and respect. They are so clearly gentle creatures, going about their own business and trying to avoid humans wherever possible.

Unfortunately though that isn’t possible. Elephants have become a problem here because we humans keep on multiplying and expanding our domain. As land owners convert more and more jungle land into coffee plantations and pump rivers dry to irrigate their off-season crops, elephants have less area to roam and less means of sustaining themselves. Everyone wants to keep these huge animals off their land, away from themselves and their valuable rice, coffee, fruit trees, water pumps, buildings and vehicles so they do all they can to drive them away when they approach. The current favoured method is firing shots in the air and setting off firecrackers. Some have also erected electric fences. All of these measures irritate and agitate the elephants, and succeed in detering only for a very limited time. We have dabbled in alternative methods of elephant control, including bee-hive fences and chilli smoke, but haven’t got anywhere so far and my guess is that the elephants would soon wise up to these too. Nobody at least in our area seems to be looking at the bigger picture: How can we create corridors where elephants can safely move from one jungle area to another without damaging property and/or encountering humans? How can we compensate them for their shrinking wilderness? How do we halt or at least slow down cultivation and construction and protect the jungle?

After much discussion on how to keep snakes out of the bedrooms and elephants out of our land, and numerous attempts to beat back the jungle and seal all the holes, Bharath and I are agreed on one thing. No matter what you do if they want to get in they will find a way. “Bar beka, barutte.” So perhaps the best approach is to come to terms with the fact that these visitations can and will occur and instead to focus on being vigilant at all times. Humans have survived being in close contact with such wild animals not by shutting them out but by being alert and skilled at tracking, avoiding and managing encounters with them. The trouble is that now we have lost those abilities and thus rely much more heavily on structures and contraptions than our own wits. And as we become more successful in our man-made environments at keeping nature out we become even less able to handle wildlife and even more scared.

We also have to accept that an accident could happen. However many precautions we take we cannot eliminate that possibility. Modern society, with its risk-minimising paraphernalia – insurance, liability, health and safety regulations – doesn’t like the unpredictable and the dangerous. But life, real life outside a concrete box, can never be risk-free.
