Saudhe

Over the last three or four months we have learnt what it means to find, collect, cut and stack a year’s worth of firewood. Never again will I look at a pile of logs with complacence.

We combed almost every inch of our land hunting for fallen trees and smaller logs and twigs, with the more adventurous among us climbing dead trees and lopping off branches. We spent hours piling sticks up and packing them into both the jeep and Gautam’s capacious and much abused Pajero to bring them back to camp.

The great jumble of wood next to the woodshed grew and grew until we all felt there would be enough to last us a decade rather than just a year. Still we searched and collected, loaded and unloaded, only stopping when we had picked up almost every fallen stick of wood on our land.

When we were done with collecting, we started cutting. After several days of breaking up the smaller stuff with hands and feet, we realised that our mountain was fast becoming a molehill. Once our higgledy piggledy heap of sticks, branches, logs and trunks was reduced to a neat stack, it shrank considerably. Undaunted, we moved onto hacking the bigger bits with the machete or our lethally sharp two man saw.

While four of us broke, hacked and sawed for a week, Bharath re-did the woodshed, which is a simple affair of sturdy tree-trunk pillars and a tarpaulin roof. Our first attempts at stacking did not impress Bharath, “Sari illa”. And he was right, as always. The stacks started to wobble and topple. And so we had to re-do it, several times, until we were able to produce works of wood art like this:

Now at last everything from the tree trunks to the splinters are neatly and logically arranged and well protected from the rain. I cannot help but gaze lovingly at the woodshed and every stick of firewood burnt brings immense satisfaction.

Firewood has been a feature of our lives here right from the start, with almost all of our cooking and water-heating done on fires. In previous years though we have always left it up to Bharath to organise men and machinery to do the job for us; they would normally cut suitable branches from trees, use a chainsaw for the biggies and then split everything with an axe. It was all sourced from our land so we have always been self sufficient in terms of fuel but we had almost no involvement in the process. This year thanks to Avin and Jeune being here, and a continuous stream of volunteers, I felt brave enough to take it on, in spite or perhaps in part because of of Bharath’s ‘nimage agilla’. As we are also now increasingly using the much more efficient and much less smoky rocket stove to cook, it was important to get enough of the smaller and medium sized sticks; the big fat ones don’t fit.

Doing the firewood ourselves has led us to parts of our land that we haven’t visited for years, if ever, in the process discovering all kinds of interesting plants, animals and other oddities. We have learnt how to cut with khatti and saw (though not the axe – we could have split the bigger logs but kind of ran out of energy….); how to stack firewood; how to organise the piles. The wood collected just from our few acres is incredibly heterogeneous, and there is definitely a firewood hierarchy. Some are easy to break and burn in a flash but disintegrate fast. Some are ramrod straight; others are crooked, twisted or forked and need a lot of work to make them stove-ready. Some trees give wood which is light but very hard and burns for a long time. Some have such beautiful patterns you feel they shouldn’t be burnt at all.

There are many disadvantages of using fire to cook, from the trivial irritation of everything getting black with soot to the serious health hazards of smoke particularly in a small and badly ventilated kitchen. In India, and particularly in rural India, switching from firewood to gas is progress, and I can understand that.

We almost always have some kind of a camping gas arrangement here, strictly for emergencies such as tea required immediately. I hope though that we retain our wood fires. For me, it’s not the eco brownie points, the independence it gives us from the system or the enhanced flavour it lends to all the food we cook. Many off-gridders use biogas from cow manure or humanure, which offers green credentials, self sufficiency and convenience that more than makes up for that lost wood-fire taste. A fireless kitchen, however gleaming white and wonderfully easy, feels cold. There is a certain primaeval connection humans have with fire. And it feels good to be extending this connection: living on and caring for the land which grows the trees, collecting and burning the branches they have jettisoned, and making use of the ash and charcoal that the fire produces.
