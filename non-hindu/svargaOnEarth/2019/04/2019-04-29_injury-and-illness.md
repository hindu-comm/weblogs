Injury and Illness

Battle scarred from an early age

Injury is an everyday event here. We get scratched, grazed, bruised and cut as we move about. We hurt ourselves with the machete or axe. We burn our feet when hot coals fall from the stove and our hands when applying lime plaster. We swim daily in a pond whose murky depths make it perilous for the many non-swimmers who visit. We are bitten by ticks and ants, stung by bees and wasps, and at risk of serious injury and death by scorpion, snake and elephant.

For the hunter-gatherer, even a minor injury could prove fatal. The tiniest foot wound if infected could make it impossible to keep pace with your group as it wandered in search of food and water, leaving you alone without sustenance and vulnerable to predators and the elements. A major accident – falling from a tree in pursuit of honey, or being attacked by a big cat – would only mean a more certain, quicker death.

When humans started to live in fixed settlements and farm, injury became less life threatening, in that you could recuperate at home while others brought you food (if your family set up had the manpower to manage without you for that time). Still, a broken bone could be the end of you.

In today’s world, modern medicine does a pretty good job of fixing injuries. Doctors and hospitals are at their best when lancing an abscess, healing a third degree burn or stitching up a head wound. Modern urban life too is fairly conducive to recovery. If you think it’s tough managing in an apartment and/or office with a broken leg, try doing it without crutches, running water or food delivery apps.

The flip side to all this \[there had to be a flip side, didn’t there?\] is that illness is much less prevalent when you lead a physical, outdoor life in the middle of nowhere. In *Sapiens*, Harari asserts that infectious diseases, the great scourge of the agricultural and industrial eras, started to hound humans when we began to domesticate animals and live cheek-by-jowl with our chickens and cows as well as each other. Certainly history has plenty of examples of the decimation by disease that can occur when members of a ‘civilised’ society make contact with previously isolated forager peoples; witness Tasmania. The life expectancy of your average hunter gatherer was so short because of the great physical risks facing them not because of fevers and plagues; they were in much better health than their farmer and office-goer descendants.

A similar picture emerges with lifestyle diseases. Indigenous peoples whose traditional way of life is disturbed or destroyed by modern society, and ‘progress’, become easy prey to things like obesity, diabetes and addition. And if modern medicine has not been successful in eradicating and treating infectious diseases – think of the common cold and the ever controversial vaccine programmes – it has certainly failed to control and solve lifestyle diseases. Sewing up the stomach of an obese man or administering morphine to wean an addict off heroin are not exactly solutions.

Here at the Wildside there are many less bugs doing the rounds because we are in contact with far fewer humans (although we are now taking our life in our hands with the acquisition of four chickens and a duck called Cluck). Our lifestyle to a large extent precludes lifestyle diseases. And the combination of day-long movement, abundant fresh air and sunshine, good appetites and good food, and dusk-to-dawn sleep keep our immune systems strong. In some respects then we have then traded illness for injury. While we can never be complacent about the very real risk to life and limb from say a krait bite, we count ourselves lucky to be hale and hearty.
