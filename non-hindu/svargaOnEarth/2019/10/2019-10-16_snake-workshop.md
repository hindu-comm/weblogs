Snake Workshop

We have just got back from a two-day workshop on snakes and snake rescue with two of India’s big-name snake men, Snake Shyam and Gowri Shankar. A good mix of theory, practicals (such as watching, from all of two feet away, the pros release and recapture a cobra) and the excitement of speeding around town for live rescues, the workshop was run by an extremely professional team from the Agumbe-based [Kalinga Centre for Rainforest Ecology.](http://kalingacre.com/)  
I learnt a great deal and thought I’d note down the most pertinent stuff here. The more we all know about snakes, the better we can co-exist safely with them.

Behaviour

I had never appreciated just how crucial it might be to know when a particular snake breeds or how it moves. Understanding the what, when, how and why of snakes could massively reduce the chances of a bad snake encounter.

Being cold blooded, snakes have to keep seeking places with an optimum temperature (18 to 21 centigrade) and humidity. To do this they alternate between staying put in their burrows and coming out to bask in the sun. That means that in the summer here they might come out early morning and evening but in the winter, when temperatures drop to 5 centigrade sometimes, more like midday. It also means that they will seek warmer places (a nice cosy woodpile for instance) when it gets chilly, and cooler places (like a shady, cemented verandah) when it gets too hot.

Snakes rely on solar energy to help them metabolise their food. So in the rains here, when the sun might not come out for weeks, they don’t eat much which means they don’t hunt much which means there’s not much reason to emerge from their burrows save for a bit of rain-bathing.  
By contrast, the summer is breeding season (except for pit vipers, which breed in the rains). This is the time we might see males fighting, or couples mating. And certainly April and May are snake-heavy here.

Snakes move in one of four ways (see my beautifully illustrated explanation below).

If you see one moving in open ground, or if you see a track, you can narrow down the possibilities by first identifying which type of movement it was.

I have always imagined the snakes we see here coming into our little patch and then moving on. Somehow in my mind they were itinerant. Not so. They have a small territory of maybe 500 square metres. That has several implications: The first is that that cobra we saw yesterday wasn’t just passing through; it lives here. This is its home as much as ours. It will have seen us many many times, and done all it can to ensure that we don’t see it. The second is that relocating a rescued snake far away from where it was found (ie: more than a km or so) can lead to a vulnerable, defensive reptile in a new, unknown area. It also means that the dynamics of the original place change. Now there is no dominant male cobra around, so a new one might appear on the scene. And he doesn’t know the place or you. Better the snake you know…

And finally, snakes recognise only mate, prey or predator. We humans are none of these so they are not quite sure what to do with us. They don’t really want to waste venom on something that they can’t eat and isn’t planning to eat them. So most of the time they scoot when they see humans. If they feel threatened, often they give us warnings, like the hiss of the cobra or Russell’s viper or the growl of a rat snake.

Identification  
We have spent many many hours poring over our various snake books trying to identify the flash of snake we just saw. Was it a viper, or a harmless keelback? A worm snake or a baby krait?

Out of the 300-odd snakes in India about 30-40 are venomous (this excludes the ‘semi-venomous’ category in most books; apparently this nomenclature is being phased out as it’s unhelpful, either the snake is venomous to humans or it’s not). Out of these, we can discount the large amount of venomous sea snakes as they have little human contact and almost never bite. Similarly snakes like the coral snake are venomous but unlikely to bite and have tiny fangs. This leaves us with a few reasonably well known ones like the pit vipers and king cobra, plus the big four.  
The big four account for almost all snakebite deaths in India. They are:

Cobra, the gentleman of the group, slow to anger and not always sure of aim  
Krait, the silent night-time killer  
Russell’s Viper, the muscled-up bad boy with a fiery temper who never misses  
Saw-Scaled Viper, the tiny but deadly side-winder

Prevention

First of all, what doesn’t prevent snakes? No plant or herb or spice will keep snakes away. Snake trenches don’t work. The smell of dogs may make only a negligible difference. Cooking fires and smoke also don’t keep snakes from entering your home if there is a nice tasty mouse on offer.

The most critical thing is not to offer free board and lodging to snakes. Keep your living area free of rodents, and as far as possible of frogs and toads. And ensure you haven’t accidentally created any nice warm or cool hiding places for a snake to shelter in.

Second, be aware and alert at all times. Don’t stick your hand in a pile of leaves without first prodding it with a stick. Don’t put on your boots before shaking them out. And so on. We all know it but need to make sure we actually do it, and teach others especially children.

Snake Rescue

If a snake does end up in your house or living area, who you goin’ to call? Snake catchers! Well, yes in fact. Gowri and team emphasised again and again that only really experienced people should attempt a snake rescue. So I’m not even going to describe what to do here. Call the experts in. If you’re in a rural area where there are no snake catchers you can call, and you’re not trained to rescue snakes yourself, it’s very difficult. Don’t atempt a rescue. Try to encourage the snake to peacefully leave your home.

Snake Bite

If someone does get bitten by a snake, what should you do? Do NOT: apply a tourniquet, cut near the bite, suck the wound, or give the victim any alcohol, food or even water.

Instead get them to a hospital asap; do not waste a second. There the doctor will use observation and an envenomation test (clotting and bleeding times) to see if there is venom in their system. If they conclude there is they will then administer a test dose of anti-venom, and only after the patient has shown to have tolerated the anti-venom will they start a course of it. Anti-venom is serious stuff and can kill. It is sensible to store 5-10 vials if you know the nearby medical establishments may not stock it, but never ever try to administer it. Leave that to the doctor.

Even in the case of a bite from a non-venomous snake, it’s probably best to go to hospital to get a tetanus jab if nothing else. And as most of the time the victim won’t know which snake it was, go to hospital anyway to be on the safe side. Don’t waste time trying to kill or photograph the snake; even if you do ascertain it was a saw-scaled viper you still don’t know whether it was a dry or wet bite. So get to a good doctor and let them worry about the rest.

Strategy for The Wildside

Based on all this and our experience so far, here is our snake-safe strategy for The Wildside:

1\. No shrubs, bushes or creepers within 10-15ft of any of our structures. We recently uprooted and moved all of our beautiful and flourishing creepers from the pillars and walls of the bedrooms and kitchen after spotting three snakes use them as ladders.  
2. All paths and areas where people move about are strimmed very low or dug so as to minimise the risk of someone stepping on a snake. Snakes also dislike having to cross these open, exposed spaces.  
3. Absolutely everything possible is kept in metal trunks to ensure there is nowhere for mice to nest in and nothing for them to feed on. The mice here love chewing tents, plastic boxes, shoes, pills, clothes, mattresses… So it’s not just about keeping food locked away.  
4. Both Gautam and I are completely neurotic about keeping the whole place tidy. We do regular clean outs of all common areas, especially our storage rooms. All construction material (old bricks, tiles etc) is kept in one open space and far away from any building. And the children have to clear away their rainwater harvester/Lego buildings/mud creations/homemade arrows by the end of the day, or risk the clean-up demon throwing it all away.  
5. Everyone who visits is encouraged to take due precaution, including using a torch and wearing shoes at night; to be alert at all times; and to supervise any children who aren’t old enough or wise enough to be taught due caution.  
6. We plan to keep vials of the powdered anti venom (which doesn’t need to be refrigerated) on site and would always take them with us to the hospital if someone was bitten.  
7. We already know Sakleshpur government hospital can’t handle snake bites so we would go straight to Hassan. We hope to locate a good doctor there who would follow the observation, envenomation test, trial dose of anti-venom, start of anti-venom course protocol. We know at least two incidents where doctors wanted to administer anti-venom without doing the necessary tests, and have heard several horror stories where a victim of a non-venomous snake bite died from the anti-venom.  
8. As we don’t have the luxury of being able to call in a rescuer, for now this is our rescue strategy: if we see a snake in our living area but not inside, we would encourage it to return to the jungle. If it was in a closed space like a bedroom we would open the main door and try to get it to exit. In either case we would be very careful to ensure we keep an eye on the snake until it departs and keep all adults and children safely out of the way.
