Vaccinations

After getting on for two years of research, discussion and debate on the big vaccination issue, I feel I have finally found an excellent, balanced resource to enable us to make informed decisions. Dr Richard Halvorsen’s book, [*Vaccines: Making the Right Choice for Your Child*](https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-lenovo&sxsrf=ACYBGNQwQ09XSrmpLAjiyBWYjZ1ELUMY9g:1571221548235&q=Vaccines:+Making+the+Right+Choice+for+Your+Child&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOOQUeLVT9c3NEyJt0jOM0syMhIrykzOSCxKUchIzCnLLypOzVNIys_PjpItS0xOzsxLLVZIKVIIgqrxgKk5xcgDMsYoKTctObvICMo1jK80NywvtzjFiGoJXHVBilmRGYybkW6SU1BlYfiLUQzDfLAbGlgYF7EahEHdYaXgm5idmZeuUJKRCnRQekaJgnNGfmZyqkJafpFCZH5pEZCfmZMCAPTIlDHjAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_uPuxyKDlAhVQfSsKHcseB3EQs9oBKAIwBHoECA4QCw&biw=480&bih=678), is written from his perspective as a practising GP in the UK. Having vaccinated his own and many other children he began to have doubts when he started a research project into the MMR vaccine. Here he presents a potted history of each disease and its vaccine in the UK and offers sensible advice on which jabs make sense for which children.

For specific information on each vaccine, read the book.

What follows are musings on more general issues.

The vaccine that doctors and the government assures us is totally safe today is tomorrow withdrawn because it’s not at all safe. Mercury in vaccines was completely safe, until it wasn’t, and then mercury-free vaccines were introduced. It’s also rather worrying that the oral polio vaccine and the whole-cell whooping cough vaccines that are currently being used in India have been replaced in the UK, after many years of use, because of serious safety concerns.

The introduction of a vaccine often creates a new, unforseen problem, quite apart from any safety concerns. For instance the measles vaccine has pushed up the age people acquire the disease from childhood, when it is almost always harmless, to teenage- and adult-hood, when it causes more and serious complications.

In the developed world, many of the vaccinatable diseases kill only a very few, often already vulnerable children. Yet to prevent these deaths governments encourage, or force, millions of children to be vaccinated at huge financial cost and at an incalculable cost to health – even if we ignore the very few that react badly to a jab and end up disabled or dead, it’s common to have fever, pain, swelling and quite possibly long-term effects we aren’t aware of yet. Is this logical? In the UK for instance, 100,000 children have to be vaccinated with the Meningitis B jab in order to prevent one death from the disease.

If governments and international bodies such as the WHO want to really reduce childhood deaths in the developing world, they would be better off focusing on clean water and good nutrition rather than risky vaccination drives. That wouldn’t be so popular though with the pharmaceutical industry’s fastest growing sector, vaccinations.

The best advice Halvorsen gives is to ask these three questions before deciding whether to vaccinate or not:

1\. Is the disease common and is it serious?  
The risk of contracting Hepatitis B for instance in the UK is extremely low unless you have unprotected sex or share needles. So why are babies, even those born to mothers who don’t have Hep B, vaccinated at birth?

Mumps and Rubella are – or rather were – very common childhood diseases but also very mild. The only real danger is if you are a teenage boy (in the case of mumps) or a teenage girl (in the case of rubella). So screen these two higher risk groups and vaccinate if they don’t have the relevant antibodies. Don’t vaccinate everyone, as currently happens with the MMR.

2\. Is the vaccine effective? Often a vaccine is launched with great fanfare – one shot will protect your child for life. Efficacy figures then start to fall as reality hits and soon a booster shot is introduced, and then another. Lifelong immunity, where applicable, seems to be guaranteed only by catching the wild versions of the diseases.

3\. Is the vaccine safe? The first big vaccine scare in the UK was the 1970s whooping cough vaccine drive which was linked to brain damage. It is scary to read that the testing for MMR involved actively following up trial children for only six weeks. Or to find out that vaccines are not subject to the stringent safety checks other new medicines undergo.

Brave are the naysayers when it comes to vaccines. Debate on the subject is vigorously discouraged. Parents who question vaccination policy, hesitate to vaccinate or seek alternatives have been likened to drunk drivers and accused of having blood on their hands – and not by internet weirdos but by the Glasgow Health Board and the [British Health Minister](https://www.google.com/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2019/05/04/anti-vaxxers-blood-hands-says-health-minister-9411348/amp/). Outside the UK, those that don’t vaccinate are liable to have child support withdrawn and school admission refused; in Pakistan parents have even been arrested. Doctors and other experts who don’t tow the official pro-vaccine line also pay a hefty price. So it is with some trepidation that I press the ‘publish’ button for this post.
