Happy Birthday to Our Fruit Forest

![](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/img_20191010_134510.jpg?w=656)

Our fruit forest turned one today. Many of the fragile saplings we planted last September are now thick-trunked trees with branches that reach well above our heads. We did lose another ten or so of the weakest plants over the monsoon but most have flourished, and how.  
The trees themselves don’t seem bothered by their shrinking leg (and arm) room, but it is certainly getting harder and harder for us to access the most dense spots. On the other hand, the burgeoning canopy means that there are many less weeds on the forest floor, so we don’t really need to go in there, save for the odd measuring and to harvest fruit – guavas and mulberries at the moment.  
It looks like our next challenge is going to be protecting the fruit from our animal friends. Rabbits or perhaps peacocks are already nibbling on the guavas. Cows and buffalo if they strayed into our land would have a feast. Our biggest concern though are the elephants who are almost always present in this part of Sakleshpura – one tusker lured by the smell of ripe mango could all too easily accidentally flatten the whole fruit forest.
