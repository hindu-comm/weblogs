Perma Time

I remember the first time I heard the P word, from a friend whose cousin had quit normal English life for some kind of commune in southern Europe’s warmer climes. Yurts also came into it if I remember correctly. At any rate that was an eye opener for us. Previous to that we had talked vaguely about organic farming. Permaculture is much more holistic, a whole way of living in relationship with your land, and much more zeitgeisty. It is also vast and, for newbies like us at least, completely overwhelming.

Most people approach it via a permaculture design course, but that requires a minimum two week commitment sans enfants – 2030 maybe. Bill Mollison’s cornerstone text, *The Permaculture Manual*, consists of hundreds and hundreds of information- and idea-rich pages, and is mainly aimed at those in temperate climates. Want to watch the [free video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYZ41SOIK0&t=1s) instead? There are 40 episodes of an hour or two each.

So, while aspiring to the holy permaculture grail for many years, we have done very little about it. My bedside table is already piled high with tomes on earthbag building, ayurvedic herbs, Indian trees and rocket stoves. And we rarely find time hanging heavy in daylight hours. We are fortunate in that many of those who visit the Wildside have a permaculture design course or two under their belt and have been able to dispense sound advice on rainwater harvesting, soil building,energy management, and of course the two biggies swales and mulching. While we were able to form some kind of idea about what to do in theory, it still seemed too huge a task to start. Maybe next week, or next year.

One such visitor, Moshik, a volunteer who came for a week and stayed for a month, proved to be the turning point. Well versed in permaculture lore and keen to try out his theoretical knowledge in practice, he kick started our journey into Bill Mollison territory with a papaya and banana circle, and soon we were marking out swales with a home-made A-frame, obsessing about nitrogen-fixing trees and of course mulching mulching mulching.

The papaya and banana circles are large mulch pits fed by grey water and planted around with papaya, banana, sweet potato and other tubers, lemon grass, pineapple, ginger and turmeric.

We have now built three and hope that they will soon provide us with plenty of fruit, unlike the hundreds of other banana and papaya plants that have either died or stopped growing. If they work we may try to extend them into a large vegetable garden as shown in this diagram:

The soil-building is rather more complex. I had never appreciated the fact that tropical soils are in fact much more fragile and potentially poor than in temperate climates such as England. As Moshik put it the nutrition in the tropics is all tied up in the fauna and flora. Strip the land of the jungle that shades and noursishes it and the soil deteriorates very fast. If the large-scale agriculture of Europe and North America has degraded the soil there, it is catastrophic when practiced here.

Much of our land is exposed scrubby grassland. The soil is poor: acidic, prone to erosion (as seen by plant roots spreading laterally instead of down) and with very little water retention capacity. That is why the fruit trees we planted here have not done well. In fact what we should have done is first build swales to prevent water run off and erosion, and then plant fast growing nitrogen-fixing trees whose roots would hold the soil and also enrich it. High maintenance plants like these hybrid fruit trees should have come right at the end. Ah well. \`

So that’s what the plan is now. We have started with a few swales on two slopes that are particularly degraded and are planting as many gliricidia and haluvannu cuttings as we can along paths and boundaries.

Towards the end of the rains we want to plant some other flowering nitrogen fixers like Gulmohar and various Cassia varieties. And we have worked on getting wagon-loads of mulch – elephant-trampled banana and fishtail palm trees, rich decomposed leaf litter from the jungle, gliricidia and silver oak cuttings – for liberal application to the swales, all of our existing trees and any areas that need covering. This probably amounts to about 5% of the mulch we need, but it’s a start.

It’s taken us four years and many mistakes to get to the point where we are actually rehabilitating our land. A hydrogeologist who came had told us that if we greenify this area enough an underground spring will come back up somewhere between the house and the kere. That would really be the icing on the cake.
