Fruit Forest Update

As promised, an update on [the fruit forest we planted in September](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2018/10/16/a-fruit-forest/):

…and now

Even Bharath has been impressed with the rate at which most of the trees have prospered. The mangoes have shot up and put out beautiful red leaves. The guavas are fruiting already. The jasmine bushes are constantly in bloom. One pipal tree is over 10ft tall. And many others such as the Chaste Tree (Vitex negundo, Lakki in Kannada), Siris (Albizia lebbek) and Neem (which doesn’t normally grow well in this region) look like they’re on steroids.

Laggards include lemon and pomegranate, which are growing but only just. Some such as the agaru, the tree which gives us the agar in agarbatti, and nutmeg seem to be withering away to nothing. And certainly some trees have died.

The soil doesn’t exactly look rich. It is still the light, sandy soil it was earlier, prone to cracking and hardening. I haven’t seen any earthworms or any other sign of optimal soil health. Thanks to the several tons of biomass though it seems to be nutritious and soft enough for the trees to flourish. The rear sweep of the forest area is proof of this. On the fated night of the JCB that corner didn’t get dug or mixed properly and is therefore too compacted and poor in nutrients. All the trees here are still small and thin, and this is where almost all of the deaths have occurred.

![Some saplings have died](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_20190531_161447.jpg?w=324&resize=324%2C243&h=243#038;h=243 "IMG_20190531_161447")

Some saplings have died

Maintenance over the last eight months has been minimal. We have watered daily, except when it has rained. We have added fresh straw as mulch to the forest floor whenever it has started to look a bit thin, about every two or three months. We have applied jivamrta monthly. We have replaced stakes that have broken or become too small. And once a month or so I weed the whole thing. Our other 200 odd saplings, which are spread over several acres, have been a handful these past few months. We all had mutilated arms and legs from hacking down the jungle trying to find many of them. And we have done regular mass watering and mulching drives with our ever-changing gang of volunteers. The fruit forest, by contrast, is a one-man job and blissfully easy.

I have tried to track the growth of about 20 different trees. Some have remained almost the same height and some have shrunk – either because my measuring method is not foolproof, or because a taller branch has broken off, or both. We have also tried to keep tabs on trees that have died. I reckon between 5 and 15 saplings have died so far, which is exactly the 2-5% Afforrest say to expect. I’m not sure which species; it’s fairly difficult to identify a tree once dead and I haven’t been monitoring them closely enough to know.

The full Excel file with all the data in can be accessed [here](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tree-growth-and-mortality.xls "tree growth and mortality").

Some friends who visited pointed out that the thorny trees we have planted, including Ber and Bael, are going to make it all rather impenetrable. This is a good point and one we haven’t really dealt with yet. We could trim them but Afforrest’s instructions ask us not to do any trimming. I am also a bit worried about the Pipal and Banyan trees. I did specifically ask whether it would be a good idea to plant them and was assured all would be well but given how big the Banyan in particular grows – much bigger than the 1000 sq ft area which encompasses the entire fruit forest – I do wonder in hindsight whether we would have done better to omit them.

My biggest concern now though is the monsoon. Will these saplings be able to handle three or four months of incessant Western Ghat rains? We have added an extra layer of banana leaf mulch to minimise erosion and made a coconut-leaf barrier around the edges to stop too much surface water getting in or out. We have also dug swales uphill of the fruit forest (which is on a slope) so it doesn’t have to bear the full brunt of the monsoon rivers that appear within minutes of heavy rain, and to rehabilitate this area which was chewed up by the JCB and has become hard as cement. Stay tuned for the next episode post September…
