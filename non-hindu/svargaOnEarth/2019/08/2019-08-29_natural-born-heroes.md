Natural Born Heroes

An assorted bunch of oddballs, among them classicists, archaeologists and raconteurs, somehow wind up leading the Resistance in Nazi-occupied Crete, facing death by bullet, exposure and exhaustion almost every day in the island’s unforgiving mountains. Somehow they not only survive but thrive, and manage a heist worthy of Prometheus: brazenly snatching one of the two German generals and spiriting him across and off the island with several thousand of Hitler’s finest men in hot pursuit.

How on earth, is the question that [*Born to Run*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen) author Christopher McDougall takes as his premise for his second book, *[Natural Born Heroes.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/207378/natural-born-heroes-by-christopher-mcdougall/9780307742223/&ved=2ahUKEwiJv7us7qfkAhVKuY8KHb9bAN0QFjAOegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw0jejV-WVAoZhKIo_i6Tv7m)*

McDougall looks at the history of Crete, ancient and modern, to first understand how the islanders theBorn to Runmselves can pull off seemingly impossible feats of endurance with no provisions and hostile forces all around. The ‘Cretan bounce’ – the ability of even grey haired shepherds to caper up and down the mountains like their goats for hours and days in end – leads him to experts in America studying fascia profunda and “elastic-recoil energy”. Then there is Pankration, an ancient street fighting technique linked to Theseus’ defeat of the Minotaur and still alive and kicking in these lawless hills. The Cretan diet, high on superfood foraged weeds and low on carbs, takes us to the science of marathon nutrition and the busting of the great hydration and carb-loading myths. Finally, McDougall looks at what it means to be a hero, and how that fed into the ideas of two Frenchmen who have brought about a revolution, albeit a very niche one, in movement and exercise.

In tracing a line between each of these dots, McDougall finds himself running the streets of London at night, playing catch with boulders in Brazil, forgoing all starch and sugar for a fortnight and re-tracing an escape route across Crete’s highest mountain as impossible to tread as it is to find.

There is a damning synopsis on the modern gym as a business success but fitness failure: the unhappy combination of pumping poster boy Arnie, anabolic steroids and weight lifting machines has meant we all now equate bulging biceps with strength and health. And for anyone who is interested in ancestral or primal movement, there are tantalising potted histories of Parkour and MovNat. The theory that feats of superhuman endurance from Pheidippides – who is reported to have run ten consecutive marathons in three days to deliver an urgent message – onwards have utilised the body’s ability to burn its own fat as fuel makes sense but leaves me wanting more details, as does the stuff on fascia.

It may not all fit in quite as neatly as hoped with the ripping yarn about the insane and often bungling abduction of the German general by Paddy Leigh Fermor and gang but both the ideas and the story are so good it doesn’t really matter. As *Born to Run* made many of us shed our trainers and secretly wonder whether we could ever see the Tarahumara in action, so *Natural Born Heroes* makes you want to learn how to move like these mountain sheep-rustlers, if not in the magical land of Crete then at least in your local Parkour class.
