A New Name

This time two years ago I brought Uppu here for a short stay only for Gautam and I to realise as the weeks and months passed that this was in fact now home. This time one year ago Theos was born in a beautiful water birth in Goa and the three of us moved back here a few weeks later, with Gautam continuing to commute on the weekends.

So it seems appropriate that we are now marking another beginning, that of The Wildside. We had never named the piece of jungle land upon which we live. We weren’t quite sure what it was or what we wanted it to become. The ideas of wilderness and wildness, of escaping the nets of comfort and convenience that civilisation has spread have all become increasingly central to our lives here. And the discovery of the term ‘wildschooling’ captured our imaginations immediately; how better to describe what the children do here. So, with a nod, albeit in a very different context, to Lou Reed, The Wildside it is.

In one of Uppu’s books there is a tiger who, railing against having to wear clothes, walk upright and talk politely in the city, throws it all off and escapes to the jungle only to find he misses his friends too much. Like him we found it’s hard to live alone, even in paradise. We have a rich and wonderfully eclectic stream of short term residents here – friends, family, homeschooling families and volunteers – but no one else who calls this home. That has now changed with the arrival of another family of four.

Jeune and Avin, and their five year old twins Elena and Ethan, quit Bangalore to move here in late November. Avin is a technical whiz cum master chef who has already fixed the solar lights, set up a stereo and blender and brought home our first farm animals, a pair of ‘broiler chickens’ who are discovering for the first time movement, sunlight and freedom. Jeune is one of those super women who can smile through squabbling children, thieving dogs, unexpected visitors and still produce the perfect chocolate cake on a campfire. They are true believers in self-suffiency, making and doing almost everything themselves, from moving house to brewing wine to sewing the children’s clothes.

The twins have settled in fast and we now have three Mowglis (plus one in training) running wild. To those who ask, as so many do, “but what do you do all day with the children”, the answer is we don’t. They do. There are no typical days so let me describe a few highlights from yesterday instead:

all three carted half filled buckets back and forth to help out for the much-anticipated bimonthly watering of the saplings

Ellie started collecting Lantenna flowers to make chutney, and was soon joined by the boys who made chat masala

one of the volunteers who was looking up a bird he had spotted helped satisfy the children’s curiosity by showing them the various birds he had identified so far

a family friend much loved by the children came to say good-bye which caused excitement and then sadness

Ethan made freshly burnt papad at lunch while Ellie looked after Theos as he ate; Uppu was being given an outdoor body scrub and oiling

they decided to rename themselves ‘Susu’, ‘Upside Down’ and ‘Princess Beauty’ respectively

Uppu and Ellie had a fight about a stick which Uppu then hid so she couldn’t find it

all three accompanied Jeune and I into the vegetable garden where they got very grumpy with us for not paying them enough attention, ate some ripe tomatoes, counted the ridge gourds, discovered a baby watermelon and danced along the pipes that demarcate our beds

they then came with us for a brainstorming session on what to do with the cottage, made a tunnel through the bookshelves which they then chased each other through screaming so loudly that we abandoned our discussion

Uppu tried to cut off a piece of old plastic pipe with a blade which led to experiments on wood with a saw and soon they were all sitting in the campfire ash making a refrigerator-oven out of a huge log

It feels good to be sharing this space with others and living as members of a community, with all the sharing, support, compromise, fun and challenges that entails. With a name and people The Wildside seems complete.
