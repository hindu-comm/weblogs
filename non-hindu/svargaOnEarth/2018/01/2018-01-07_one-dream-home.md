One Dream Home

Home ownership is the defining aspiration of urban middle class India. Billboards as big as buildings shout to you from every major road of every major Indian city. For the entry level buyer there are basic flats in sky-high towers, quite possibly on a flood plain in the middle of nowhere but almost always with amenities – a club house and pool at least. Those with the budget can opt for a villa in a mock Venice, complete with faux waterways, or a classy loft apartment in a ‘city’ (a complex of houses, shops, hospitals, schools and entertainment establishments, all nicely gated to keep out the riff raff) that mimics New York.

We too bought into the dream. Twice. We currently rent out our nicely appointed flat in a leafy neighbourhood of Bangalore, where we spent a happy two years before Gautam’s job necessitated a move. Neither of the two flats we have owned, though, nor any of the many places I have called home – from the leaking Bombay attic constantly filled with artists, musicians, smoke and rats that Gautam and I once lived in to the comfortable farmhouse with sloping green lawn, pool and tennis court that I grew up in in Dorset – are a patch on our new house.

As readers of this blog will know, we started building our round earthbag house in February of this year. We finished the bulk of it by July and have been fixing problems – leaking roof, collapsing plaster,

that kind of thing – and fine tuning since then. In the city, you normally choose between a 1BHK, 2BHK or 3BHK, ie: a one, two or three bedroom-hall-kitchen. Ours is a 1B, no hall, no kitchen. We do though have a large wraparound veranda which provides the perfect indoor-outdoor space night and day.

This glorified earthbag hut is all I could have ever wished for and more. The high, spreading roof keeps it naturally cool even in the heat of the day, so no need for a fan. Strategically placed glass tiles in the roof mean we only ever use the (solar) lights at night. It is small enough for me to keep reasonably clean and tidy without help from either human or machine – a first for us. And there is a wonderful simplicity to living in just one room. Storage, by way of trunks, is limited thus naturally curtailing the amount of clutter. We have a few sets of farm clothes and one or two of town/festival clothes; one bamboo rack is more than sufficient for all. I now no longer collect books as I used to – our Bangalore flat has five huge bookshelves stuffed full of them – and instead we have a book exchange system. Anyone who comes can take one of the books we have already read and leave one of their own in its place. Serendipity is a welcome by-product of this system; I end up reading all kinds of novels and non-fiction I would never have come across on my own. Furniture consists mainly of our old Bangalore bed, beanbags, hanging things and one proper table and chair set donated by my parents.

One of the reasons we decided to build ourselves a house rather than continue to live in our shipping container room was because I wanted an indoor and less public bathroom arrangement. Braving mud, cold or over-enthusiastic dogs in the middle of the night was fine for short periods, but how I appreciate being able to pad to the loo barefoot and take a shower in a bathroom free of muddy footprints. Our Indian compost loo and simple bathroom are built out of mud bricks that we manufactured here.

We also now enjoy the luxury of running water – think a tap to fill buckets rather than power showers – as well as a solar water heater in anticipation of lots of baby-related laundry, and are much enjoying the added ease both bring.

Living in the round is also, as many told us it would be, aesthetically and quite possibly spiritually uplifting. Our two window arches provide us with such daily delight as to more than worth every moment of brain-numbing calculation and sweat-dripping exertion they occasioned.

We are thrilled to have discovered the joys of painting with tinted whitewash (if anyone wants more details on this let me know). And when at night or in the early morning we look up from our bed at the light filtering through the circle of glass tiles in the roof, it is, as Gautam says, rather like being in a space ship.

Cliched though it may be, there is an immense satisfaction in living in a house that you conceived, designed and built yourself. Well, perhaps not *built* ourselves but certainly helped our incredibly strong, skilled and hard-working team of local workmen build. It would be a tribute indeed if any of them ever decided to ditch the brick-and-cement construction that is now universal here for a mud structure, but, despite their admiring the house when they came to see the finished product and commenting on how cool it was inside, none has yet expressed an interest to try out these techniques. We live in hope.

Perhaps this really is the key to happy home ownership: to build or help build the house you live in with your own two hands. This is of course how humans have created their shelters for millions of years; specialised, professional house building is relatively recent and even today limited to the select few. Sadly though I can’t see the great Indian middle class, not to mention the property developers and their marketing cronies, getting into this anytime soon.
