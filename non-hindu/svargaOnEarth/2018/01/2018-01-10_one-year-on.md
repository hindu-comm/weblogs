One Year On

It has been almost a year since we started living on our patch of wilderness.

A year in which we built ourselves a [mud house in the round](https://svargaonearth.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/one-dream-home/) and fell wholly in love with it, watching the moon through the glass tiles in the roof and relishing our one-room existence.

A year in which, after heart-breaking attempts to adopt, we were all of a sudden presented with a DIY job, a pregnancy moulded by our natural way of living, necessarily and happily far removed from doctors, scans and Google and thus guided instead by intuition and introspection as well as the support of some wonderfully wise women.

And a year which has quite probably been the best of our respective lives for me and for Uppu.

In our pared-down existence, in our days filled with the simple necessities and pleasures of life, in the beauty and peace that surrounds us, in the company of the people and animals we live alongside, I have found the contentment and well being that I have long sought.

And Uppu? Every day shows me anew just how much he is thriving here in body, mind and soul. Could any young child fail to flourish in such an environment?

The only shadow is Gautam’s absence during the week, sometimes longer, and the strain of having to live apart. He is though finally pursuing a long-held dream of creating his own brand after escaping his corporate cage. So now we just have to wait for him to make his millions and retire.

We are lucky to have found a wonderful midwife in Goa with whom we plan to have a homebirth in a small village near Anjuna. We have just arrived here and will return first to Bangalore in mid February, and thereafter to Sakleshpur, perhaps in March.

A very happy new year to all of our sahacharins (co-journeyers), and we hope to see you at the farm at some point in 2018. And to celebrate the high speed wifi here in Goa, here are lots and lots of photos…
