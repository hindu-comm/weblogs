Plogging Party

We will be hosting Sullakki’s first ever plogging party from 28th – 30th September, courtesy of outdoor-enthusiasts [CampMonk](https://campmonk.com/) and India’s plogging poster boy Jacob Cherian.

For those who haven’t yet plogged, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging) is the Wikipedia lowdown.

All are welcome – [here](https://www.facebook.com/504200022/posts/10160716156675023/)‘s the Facebook event page.
