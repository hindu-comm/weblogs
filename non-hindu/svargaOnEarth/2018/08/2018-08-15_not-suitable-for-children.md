Not Suitable for Children

I was looking up an interesting farmstay recently â€“ mud buildings, organic farm, freshwater pool, that kind of thing â€“ and happened upon a Trip Advisor review of the place. Herewith complete and unabridged:

*Well lemme be straight.* *we visited the place this weekend with family and friends. we booked 2 cottages and honestly we all were hugely disappointed at the end*

*1) To start with we reached the place and were greeted with 5 big DOGS.. now i agree that the dogs* *were friendly but at the first instances the kids get really psyched when they see them and also not everyone enjoy company of pets*

*2) the cottages were fine but the flush was not working in one of them, there were no additional blankets* *and again to top it up the dogs were with us when we wanted to CHILL outside*

*3) Food was average and nothing great. For veg people there are hardly any options as they server* *only organic stuff which is home grown. Now for people like us are ok with limited option BUT WHAT I CANT TOLERATE IS DOGS COMING AND SITTING NEXT TO US WHILE WE ARE HAVING FOOD.. as the kids were still afraid and we have to mange the kids rather than the* *owners taking care of the dogs ðŸ™‚*

*4) Cottage has insects and mosquitoes which dont add anything great to the room or ambiance. Also* *once it turns dark there are no white lights in rooms and becomes really boring in evening*

*5) The snooker table was not in any great condition neither was the pool, full of insects and flies.* *We cant really take a dip in there*

*6) Lastly the price which I have to pay for this facility â€“ 8,350/- for a couple of one night.. I* *guess that way toooooo much for the service which I got*

*Wont recommend to anyone with KIDS or if you are planning to go for a luxury time.. you might be highly disappointed*

Now you know why we would never set up a homestay on our farmâ€¦

The sad truth is that many children in Bangalore do struggle outside the city. Often they have never experienced the great outdoors except through the medium of a screen. Wilderness and wildlife are at best irritating and tedious, at worst terrifying.

Nature may be the aspiration du jour for Bangaloreâ€™s home-owners and holiday-makers â€“ as all those ads attest â€“ but the reality the glossy photos represent is way more than most can hack.
