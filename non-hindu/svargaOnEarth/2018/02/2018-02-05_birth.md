Birth

![waterbirth photo](https://svargaonearth.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/waterbirth-photo.jpg?w=656)

I almost didn’t have the guts to publish this image. How many of us have actually seen birth photos? We tend to be too squeamish and embarrassed about this most elemental fact of human existence.

Just before the sky began to lighten on Friday 26th January, we birthed our second son, Theos Omakshara.

There is so much I want to say about an event that chokes me with emotion every time I think about it, but it is so hard to say it. Let me at least try.

Our quest for a midwife and a homebirth led us, after many twists and turns, to Goa late in our pregnancy. Our first child, Uppu, was born in a hospital, one of the fancy exclusive birthing hospitals that are springing up all over India, complete with luxury suites, baby shops and newborn photographers. We were lucky enough to find an obtstrician who believes in and supports natural birth and, after going to great lengths to ensure we would be allowed to birth with minimal intervention, we had the birth we wanted, at least on paper. Uppu was born vaginally with no drugs and no intervention. He took to the breast quickly and fairly easily and bar painkillers and antibiotics for me, neither of us had any kind of issue.

We had won for ourselves the natural ante-natal experience we had fought so hard for (Why should anyone have to fight – flooding the body with muscle-tensing, -clenching adrenaline rather than the oxytocin that birth thrives on – for what is in the truest sense of the term a birthright?), but we were left feeling somehow lacking. The hospital experience had turned me into an invalid from the moment I arrived, already in active labour, and was put into a wheelchair. I never quite shook that feeling off, so that it took me many weeks to return to health and normalcy. And somewhere among the bright lights; the succession of unknown, unnamed nurses and duty doctors checking dilation and foetal heartbeart; the sterile surroundings of our well equipped room; the aggressive ‘Push, push, push’ and having to swim to the surface of consciousness to refuse an episiotomy; the measuring and injecting of our newborn laid down in a plastic tray like a medical specimen – somewhere among all of this the euphoria of birth was limited to the moment of Uppu’s emergence. Hospitals and obstetricians have saved the lives of many an endangered mother and baby. In such situations they are invaluable. In healthy, normal pregnancies which should and would lead into healthy normal births were circumstances conducive, though, hospitals tend to do much more harm than good.

This time around, we were desperate to avoid the mainstream medicalised model. I even considered an unassisted birth, given how difficult it is to find a midwife in India (in Sakleshpur there are no longer even any traditional midwives), but neither of us felt very comfortable with that idea. Fate – via an old friend of Gautam’s – led us to [Corinna Stalhofen](https://www.facebook.com/Midwife-in-Goa-138028633402634/), a German midwife who has delivered many many babies including his friend’s over several decades in India, and to north Goa where she lives, home to many an old haunt from our broke Bombay days.

Birthing away from home though has its challenges. I was fortunate enough to have my brother and his wife sign up to be with Uppu and me for the first three weeks (free holiday in Goa…) and my parents for the second half. My biggest fear was that Gautam, who couldn’t come and base himself here, wouldn’t make it for the birth; his presence was for me an absolute necessity. In the event Theo proved himself to be a master of timing: the entire extended family had jut arrived or not yet left, and Gautam, who was in Goa but being urged to get back to the office and who had until that morning been incapacitated by an injury, was present and able.

And thus it was that in the secure calm of our temporary home in Goa, Theo made his way from the warm watery womb into the warm waters of the birthing pool before gentle hands lifted him up – for his first contact with air, his first sensation of gravity, his first experience of touch, and his first face to face meeting with his waiting family. His passage to the outside world was fast and intense, accompanied by the medicine music we have grown to love over this pregnancy, and the chanting of Om. Uppu, asleep and oblivious to the night’s proceedings, awoke of his own accord a few minutes before Theo was birthed, quietly took in the scene from the bedroom door and then came and knelt at the side of the pool to await the baby’s arrival. With the intuition of small children, he knew that there was nothing to be scared of, despite the obvious extreme physical and emotional sensations his mother was experiencing.

As a family, we shared this magical experience with only one person, Corinna. She was with us throughout, quietly offering guidance where needed and readying the room for birth. She never intruded into the private realm of consciousness that Gautam and I were creating, preferring observation to examination. Her presence allowed us to focus inwards, trusting in her expertise and experience to bring us through.

Not that it was all sacred and mystical. There were glitches. A dodgy geyser had the rest of the family in the other flat up most of the night sending buckets and pans of hot water down as Corinna tried to get the pool on temperature in time for my rapidly progressing labour. There was even some light-hearted banter and attempts to moo like a cow. And there were times when I broke down and times when I gave up. Birthing a baby is the most overwhelming physical experience I have ever known. It is inescapably raw and primal; civilisation cannot touch it (perhaps that is why the Victorians first started to drug it into oblivion). And it can be tough.

The first week has brought tears, tedium and tiredness alongside the ecstasy, as first weeks do. We are all transitioning – from the known security and comfort of life inside to the big bad world outside, from full to empty womb, from only child to brother – and transitions are by nature challenging. This time though it just feels like normal life. We eat lunch in the same spot where Theo was born. There are no visits to the paediatrician or obstetrician, only Corinna popping in to chat about how things are going. Birth has happened. We are four rather than three. And now replete with beautiful memories of Theo’s arrival, life carries us forward to experience the joys and sorrows that have been vouchsafed us with this newly emerged soul. Never have I been so full of gratitude.
