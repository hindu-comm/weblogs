[Katherine Brodsky](http://katherinebrodsky.com/) is today a freelance writer who in the early 2000’s was the founder and editor-in-chief of an online culture magazine that was registering 600,000 pageviews a month while herself still an undergrad. In this episode of the *Unsupervised Learning* podcast, Razib explores a life lived online, from the dot-com bubble to the social media era. Brodsky, whose [Substack](https://randomminds.substack.com/) is [Random Minds](https://randomminds.substack.com/), is an observer of culture from a peripatetic vantage point, a Canadian working in the American film industry, the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants watching her parents’ homeland ravaged by war, and a public relations professional who moonlights as a commentator and photographer.

Though an early adopter of internet technology who became a “content creator” before that was even the phrase, Brodsky over the last few years has been hitting the shoals of social media culture as her classical free speech-oriented liberalism and journalistic devotion to a bare modicum of objectivity run up against the realities of 2020’s “moral clarity” where strident viewpoints are prized. Razib and Brodsky agree that [Nicholas Carr](https://twitter.com/roughtype)’s 2010 book *[The Shallows](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003RCWPJW/geneexpressio-20)* already has the character of a Cassandra-like prophecy, as the internet has become a tool not for mental liberation but for enslavement to impulse and the mob. Brodsky outlines her polestar when observing and commenting on the culture, which emphasizes a level of detachment or sympathy for the “other” that is sorely lacking in much of mainstream 2020’s discourse.
