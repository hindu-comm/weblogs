What does it mean to be Eurocentric? What does it mean to be a white supremacist? What does the term ”the West” mean, and how is it different from simply the geographical designation Europe? On this episode of the *Unsupervised Learning* podcast, Razib discusses the cultural and [genetic](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13673) origins of Europeans, how they have been viewed over the last few thousand years and how they have viewed themselves. Starting around 3000 BC, when the first [Yamnaya](https://razib.substack.com/p/entering-steppelandia-pop-77-billion) [men](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe) were [expanding](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-10-going-nomad) out of the [Pontic steppe](https://razib.substack.com/p/dark-horse-out-of-the-steppe) and [assimilating](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11a-a-nowhere-mans-world) the [Neolithic](https://razib.substack.com/p/ararats-long-shadow-asia-minors-major) [Globular Amphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_Amphora_culture) culture of eastern Poland, and going down to the 20th century when the nations of the world were cleaved between those aligned with the Soviet Union versus those aligned with the USA, Razib addresses when conceptions of European, Western and white self-identity could have emerged, and indeed did emerge. Were the Classical Greeks white supremacists? Did the Spaniards impose European hegemony on the New World? And when did the West outpace the rest?
