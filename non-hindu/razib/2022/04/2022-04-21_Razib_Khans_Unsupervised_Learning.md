[Rand Simberg](https://twitter.com/simberg_space?lang=en) is the author of 2014's [Safe Is Not An Option: Overcoming The Futile Obsession With Getting Everyone Back Alive That Is Killing Our Expansion Into Space](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00L3PI102/geneexpressio-20), and a [space business consultant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rand-simberg-566a693/), as well as a longtime [blogger](http://www.transterrestrial.com/) and commentator. Today, on *Unsupervised Learning* Razib talks with Simberg about SpaceX’s ambitiously named vessel, [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship), and what it means for the space business. In the process, Simberg outlines just how much of a lead SpaceX has over its competitors, and how it has transformed the game over the last decade, lapping the private-sector competition and putting pressure on national space programs.

Razib asks Simberg about the long-term prospects for manned spaceflight, and what’s stopping us from reaching Mars and beyond. Simberg revisits some of the ideas that he presented almost a decade ago in [Safe Is Not An Option](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00L3PI102/geneexpressio-20), and argues that many of the hurdles are cultural and regulatory, not technological.
