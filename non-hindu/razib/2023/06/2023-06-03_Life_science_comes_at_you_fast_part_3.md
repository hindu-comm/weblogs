***Note:** This is the third post in a series. Here is [the first post](https://razib.substack.com/p/life-science-comes-at-you-fast-part?utm_source=url) and the [second](https://razib.substack.com/p/life-science-comes-at-you-fast-part-048?utm_source=url)*.

The above plots are of two men who are roughly half European and half East Eurasian (the one on the right precisely so) in ancestry. The individual on the right has a white mother and a Chinese Singaporean father, while the individual on the left descends from a mixed population in Guatemala (to be precise, he is 52% white, 47% indigenous and 1% Sub-Saharan African). Obviously, the East-Eurasian ancestry of the right individual is East Asian Han Chinese, while the East-Eurasian ancestry of the left individual is mostly indigenous American, in his case, Maya. But there are other clear differences between the two individuals beyond their overall ancestral origins. The segments themselves may add up to roughly the same proportions, but their patterns are so different because of the very different histories that these two people embody.

The individual on the right is a first-generation Eurasian, a “filial 1” or F1. The individual on the left is what in the Latin America of his birth is called a *mestizo*, for his mixed-race background (the term is from Latin *mixticius*, or “mixed”). The two men’s genomes differ so much despite both being mixed race and in nearly identical proportions, because the timing of their two admixtures is very different. For the F1 individual, no generations of recombination to break apart the long uninterrupted segments of exclusively European and Asian ancestry have yet intervened. In contrast, the Guatemalan individual’s finely minced segments of ancestry are the product of generation after generation of intermarriage between people all of mixed heritage, so that the segments inherited from his European and indigenous ancestors are now thoroughly shuffled along the same chromosomes.

[Recombination’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination) power to reshuffle ancestral contributions is also evident when we look at someone who has one F1 parent and one parent who matches either of the other grandparents’ races, what my plant-breeding colleagues would call a back-cross. The below chromosome composition is someone whose mother is a first-generation Eurasian (her mother Japanese, her father European American), and whose own father is also European American.
