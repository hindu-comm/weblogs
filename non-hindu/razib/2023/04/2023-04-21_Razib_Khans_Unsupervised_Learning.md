On this episode of the Unsupervised Learning podcast, Razib talks to [Peter Nimitz](https://nemets.substack.com/), the author behind the [Nemets Substack](https://nemets.substack.com/), which explores topics as diverse as the [2014 Donbass War](https://nemets.substack.com/p/memoirs-of-the-first-donbass-war) and the likelihood of [Eurasian migration into Chad](https://nemets.substack.com/p/the-sons-of-chad) thousands of years ago. Razib and Nimitz walk through his recent post, the [Seven Ages of Western Eurasia: A brief outline of the 11,700 years from the Anatolian Farmers to the Present](https://nemets.substack.com/p/seven-ages-of-western-eurasia). In the piece, he explores the changes that Europe and West Asia have undergone since the end of the last Ice Age, including the rise and fall of pre-literate civilizations before written history, and the recurrent social and economic collapses from which humans have had to rebuild.

Razib and Nimitz have similar interests, but where Razib focuses more on genetic relationships, Nimitz tends to dive deep into archaeology, supplementing his understanding of the migration of peoples with paleogenetics. They also discuss the proto-civilizations of the Ice Age, including nascent farming communities that might date to over 20,000 years ago. The conversation repeatedly circles back to the theme that paleogenetics has had a transformative effect on interpreting archaeological sites and our understanding of the migrations of past peoples.
