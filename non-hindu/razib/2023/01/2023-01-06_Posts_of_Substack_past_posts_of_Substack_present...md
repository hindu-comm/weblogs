The children are nestled all snug in their beds, which leaves me a moment to reflect. Below, I’ve thrown together some short-themed lists of past, present (or at least 2022) and projected future content, plus a handful of my usual unsolicited book recommendations. Maybe some of my readers whose Christmases include the gift of more time to read and reflect will find a podcast or worthy read they missed or be inspired to pick an old book back up. Merry Christmas, everyone!

### **Posts of Substack Past**

My old friend [John Hawks](https://johnhawks.net/weblog/the-top-10-discoveries-about-ancient-people-from-dna-in-2022/), this coming week’s podcast guest, says multiple people have asked him why he “has never been on Razib’s podcast.” [But he has](https://razib.substack.com/p/john-hawks-a-life-in-paleoanthropology#details)! I just had about 1/6th of the readership I have now when he first came on in early 2021. Here are five more sleeper podcasts only my earliest subscribers may have found.
