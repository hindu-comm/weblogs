On this episode of *Unsupervised Learning*, Razib talks to Bryan Caplan about Caplan’s new book, *[Don't Be a Feminist: Essays on Genuine Justice](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BD3C8KJM/geneexpressio-20)*. Despite what the narrow purview the title might suggest, *[Don't Be a Feminist](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BD3C8KJM/geneexpressio-20)* is a wide-ranging book that contains essays on IQ, immigration and identity politics, among other things (in addition, yes, to women’s rights). Caplan is the editor and chief writer for [Bet On It](http://betonit.substack.com/), the blog hosted by the [Salem Center for Policy](https://salemcenter.org/) at the University of Texas, and a professor of economics at George Mason. His previous books were *[The Myth of the Rational Voter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007AIXLDI/geneexpressio-20)*, [](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004OA64Q6/geneexpressio-20)*[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004OA64Q6/geneexpressio-20)*, *[The Case Against Education](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07T3QRNLC/geneexpressio-20)*, *[Open Borders](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07YRKYKZ3/geneexpressio-20)*, *[Labor Econ Versus the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09QF44HHG/geneexpressio-20)*, and *[How Evil Are Politicians?](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B09YPNFGHC/geneexpressio-20)*

Razib and Caplan also discuss his colleague Garrett Jones’ new book *[The Culture Transplant: How Migrants Make the Economies They Move To a Lot Like the Ones They Left](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BCKYZ1VY/geneexpressio-20)*, the case for open borders, the cultural tenor of academia and its future prospects
