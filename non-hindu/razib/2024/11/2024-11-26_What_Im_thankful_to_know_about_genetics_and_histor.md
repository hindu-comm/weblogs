Over the summer of 1998, I read the unabridged version of [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07DMWH73Z/geneexpressio-20) by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza. It is an incredible book. A life-changing book. But there is so much we know now that we couldn’t know then, and a lot to learn from the great researchers active since Cavalli-Sforza wrote his *magnum opus*. I’d like to stop to reflect briefly today and run through an overview of just some of the knowledge that has accrued in little more than two decades of discoveries.

**The two great transformations since then have been:**

1.  Genomics (whole genomes and computing power to analyze the data)

2.  Ancient DNA (filling in the human past with data rather than
    inference)

Below is a list of things we’ve learned (not exhaustive)…

- The major human population clusters across the world are relatively
  recent products of massive mixings between very different populations.
  How recent? Mostly over the last 4,000 to 10,000 years. In 4,000 BC
  there was no one with the genetic profile of modern Northern or
  Southern Europeans and no one with the genetic profile of modern South
  Asians. The genetic profile of West Asians and East Asians did not
  exist. The islands of Japan were inhabited by relatives of the Ainu.
  Much of Africa was occupied by hunter-gatherers that resembled the San
  Bushmen. This all outlined in David Reich’s
  [book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20):

  ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaf5f7f0-5d34-40bf-96fe-e51b599c6acc_300x453.jpeg)

- Modern human populations likely look very different from people who
  lived during the Ice Age, or even during the Neolithic. Europeans, for
  example, seem to have been under continuous selection for lighter
  skin, hair, and eyes, for the last 5,000 years. Ice Age Europeans were
  very genetically different, and much darker-skinned than modern
  Europeans (though quite possibly blue-eyed!). Many farming populations
  have lost the robustness that characterized their ancestors. Selection
  favored those with fragile bones!

- The [“Ice Age European”](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17993)
  was actually a set of very distinct populations. Some of these groups
  cluster tightly with archaeological constructs, such as “Magdalenian,”
  while other constructs, such as “Gravettian” seem very diverse and
  heterogeneous. Archaeology has a lot of insight, but genetics is
  helping fill in many details.

- The [Bell Beaker](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25738%5C)
  people of Bronze Age Western Europe seems to have originated in
  Southwest Europe but spread to Central Europe among people who were
  genetically and culturally very different. It is this second group of
  people who brought the culture to Ireland and Great Britain. This
  illustrates the sometimes surprising connections (or lack thereof)
  between genetics and culture.

- Caste and jati are [genetically real
  constructs](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/eaat7487.full_.pdf)
  and date to more than 1,000 years ago. Genetically, a Tamil Brahmin is
  more like a Brahmin from North India than they are their neighbors in
  Tamil Nadu.

- The arrival of German barbarians into the post-Roman Empire was due to
  a real migration of [a distinct
  people](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/02/21/the-folk-migration-during-the-age-of-migrations/),
  not simply an *ad hoc* culture. [Peter
  Heather](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0035KD36U/geneexpressio-20)
  was right!

- The Paleo-Siberian ancestors of Native Americans
  [separated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/science/native-americans-genetics-siberia.html)
  from the ancestors of modern Siberians more than 15,000 years ago.
  Clovis First is definitely wrong.

- Modern indigenous Australians [descend from the first
  settlers](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18299) who arrived
  ~50,000 years ago. They have not been subject to as much population
  turnover as people in Eurasia, the New World, or Africa.

- There was a [massive migration out of the Eurasian
  steppe](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) 4,000 to 5,000
  years ago. There was also migration back into the Eurasian steppe from
  Eastern Europe at the tail end of this period.

- The Huns [were genetically
  distinct](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/03/barbarian-huns-dna-germany-migration-antiquity-skull/)
  from local Europeans. They were probably East Asian in origin.

- The [arrival of
  farming](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/22/eaaz5344) in
  Europe was mostly through the migration of people from the Near East,
  who slowly and fitfully mixed with local hunter-gatherers.

- Some [groups in the
  Amazon](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dna-search-first-americans-links-amazon-indigenous-australians-180955976/)
  seem to have a distant connection with people in Southeast Asia,
  something not seen in any other New World populations.

- Overall, the [mass
  migration](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/11/07/genetic-history-rome/)
  of the Roman period didn’t have a long-term impact on Western Europe
  because of low fertility in cities, where the migrants were
  concentrated.

- Uralic people, such as the Finns, seem to exist due to a [migration
  out of the
  east](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1522-1).

- The population bottleneck that impacted all non-Africans 50 to 100
  thousand years ago did not impact ancient Africans (though there was a
  gentler bottleneck before 100 thousand years ago). Modern Africans
  descend from many local populations, along with some groups who
  migrated back from Eurasia. Hunter-gatherers, such as the Mbuti Pygmy
  and San Bushmen, have more of the “deep” diverged ancestry, while the
  farmer and pastoral groups have more “mixed” recently differentiated
  ancestry related to Eurasians.

- Speaking of San Bushmen, they seem to be subject to the [smallest
  bottleneck](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6692) effect of all
  modern human populations.

There’s a lot more we’ll learn. The next decade will be interesting. But it’s been a privilege to be an eye-witness to so much science that has answered so many open questions to various degrees of certainty.
