### **~~24-hour sale~~ AND IT’S OVER**

I discount annual subscriptions to this newsletter exactly twice a year. Once is Cyber Monday. And the other is today. Starting now, for the next 24 hours, **annual subscriptions are slashed for the next 24 hours**. Starting at **[\$50/year,](https://www.razibkhan.com/e5f508d2) that price will rise by \$1 an hour**, so there’s no time like the present. Happy 2024!

### **If you only read one \_ this year**

The temptation to excessive ambition can be nearly unavoidable as a fresh year dawns. And yet on the other hand, Laozi’s shopworn truth remains that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This time last year I shared a more ambitious [roadmap](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/your-brain-on-books-themed-readings) to a year of great reading (at a clip of 20 pages per day, you’d finish some 7300 pages for the year for a cool dozen or more great books. I still stand by those book lists if you’re feeling maximalist about your 2024 reading, or are simply the picture of self-disciplined daily consistency). If instead, you’re in the mood to start with small wins and just make sure you’ve ingested one good chunk of content at a time, you could do worse than to choose a favorite from any of the following lists. And if you like new recs regularly, my Time Well Spent feature includes themed reading lists and drops monthly (first 2024 edition tomorrow).

Here’s wishing you an edifying, profitable, healthy and peaceful 2024. If your 2024 should get crazy, and you find yourself looking back a year from now having only read one book, one in-depth Substack post, one new Substack author or one scientific paper, I promise you could do worse than the options below.

### **Five worthy books**

1.  [Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23
    Chapters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004JNNTT8/geneexpressio-20).
    Geneticists like [Joe
    Pickrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-pickrell-1b21923b/)
    have credited this book with drawing them into the field. [Matt
    Ridley’s](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/matt-ridley-evolutionist-thatcherite#details)
    book, written in the late 1990s, is still mostly relevant and
    remains eminently readable.

2.  [From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western
    Cultural
    Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060175869/geneexpressio-20).
    [Jacques
    Barzun](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/arts/jacques-barzun-historian-and-scholar-dies-at-104.html)
    finished this book when he was 92. His *magnum opus*, it delivers
    his “cold take” on Western civilization and its cultural progress.
    The author was one of the few intellectuals alive into the 21st
    century who remembered first-hand the cultural vibrance of 1920’s
    America.

3.  [The Fall of Rome: And the End of
    Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07ST77SSN/geneexpressio-20).
    Bryan Ward-Perkins is an archaeologist who presents a materialist
    case for the fall of Roman civilization. In this way, it is a
    revision of the revisionism that “Rome never fell, it just evolved.”
    A concise and readable book, it is long on data and short on
    polemical argumentation.

4.  [Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in
    America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KAH5LMK/geneexpressio-20).
    This book is the template for many later works, attempting to
    understand the deep history of American cultural variation. I
    consider it an essential corrective for the excessive racialization
    of American identity in this century.

5.  [In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of
    Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195178033/geneexpressio-20).
    This is an important work for naturally irreligious people because
    Scott Atran outlines the cognitive reasons that religion is so
    plausible to so many people, and the evolutionary reason we have
    religious intuitions.

### **Five worthy posts**

1.  [Eternal as the Nile - Three millennia of Egyptian genetic
    continuity](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/eternal-as-the-nile). The
    interest in the history and culture of Egypt goes back to the
    Greeks, 2,500 years ago. In fact, the time between the earliest
    Pharaohs and Plato is nearly as great as between Plato and
    ourselves.

2.  [Casting out the wolf in our
    midst](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/the-wolf-at-historys-door). The
    power of young men in groups, and the havoc they wrought on the
    ancient world.

3.  [You can’t take it with you: straight talk about epigenetics and
    intergenerational
    trauma](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/you-cant-take-it-with-you-straight).
    If you have ever wondered about the grand claims regarding
    epigenetics, I wrote this piece for you.

4.  [Current status: it’s
    complicated](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/current-status-its-complicated).
    The state of our understanding of human evolutionary genetics
    in 2023. The more we know, the more tangled it gets.

5.  [Facing Facts, even fraught ones: the quest for proto-Indo-Europeans
    in
    2023](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/facing-facts-even-fraught-ones-the).
    Where we are regarding Indo-Europeans in 2023. We’ve come a long
    way, though some details remain to be nailed down.

### **Five worthy friends**

1.  [Nemets](https://nemets.substack.com/). Touching on many of the same
    topics as *Unsupervised Learning*, albeit perhaps with a bit more
    archaeology, to me [Pete Nimitz’s](https://twitter.com/Peter_Nimitz)
    Substack is one more readers should know about.

2.  [The Intrinsic
    Perspective](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/). Erik Hoel is
    a neuroscientist. He is also one of the most charitable, thoughtful
    and interesting writers on this platform. More people should read
    him.

3.  [Aporia](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/). This Substack highlights
    many writers, particularly [Bo
    Winegard](https://twitter.com/EPoe187?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
    and [Noah
    Carl](https://twitter.com/NoahCarl90?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor),
    two canceled academics. [Aporia](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/)
    touches third rails like race and IQ, and it’s a place I always
    finding myself wanting to leave a comment taking issue with this or
    that provocative assertion. In other words, it’s literally provoking
    discussion (the
    [podcast](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/s/isf-podcast), often
    hosted by [Diana Fleischmann](https://www.dianafleischman.com/), is
    also great).

4.  [The Palladium Letter](https://letter.palladiummag.com/). One of my
    favorite magazines now has a newsletter. Also, going forward, the
    *Unsupervised Learning* podcast’s favorite guest [Samo
    Burja](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/samo-burja-again-finding-lost-civilizations),
    is editing the magazine.

5.  [Public](https://public.substack.com/). I respect [Mike
    Shellenburger](https://twitter.com/shellenberger), [Alex
    Gutentag](https://twitter.com/galexybrane), [Leighton
    Woodhouse](https://twitter.com/lwoodhouse) and [Zaid
    Jilani](https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani)’s efforts to still do
    straight-ahead news. [Leighton](https://twitter.com/lwoodhouse) and
    [Zaid](https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani) are also friends.

### **Five worthy papers**

1.  [The inheritance of social status: England, 1600 to
    2022](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300926120). This is a
    good summation of Greg Clark’s recent work if you don’t have time
    for books.

2.  [The Formation of Human Populations in South and Central
    Asia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/). All my
    Indian readers need to have read this 2019 paper.

3.  [Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for
    present-day Europeans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25230663/).
    Classic 2014 publication establishes a lot of the foundations for
    how we understand the ethnogenesis of Europe on a genetic level
    today.

4.  [Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a 1.1-million-person
    GWAS of educational
    attainment](https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/20191632/SuppNote.pdf).
    There has been a lot of work since 2018 in this area, but this
    seminal paper is still worth a read if you haven’t checked it out
    yet.

5.  [Ancient Admixture in Human
    History](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/192/3/1065/5935193).
    This is more of a methods paper, but if you want to understand the
    new techniques unleashed by the combination of ancient DNA and the
    genomic revolution, this is where you start.
