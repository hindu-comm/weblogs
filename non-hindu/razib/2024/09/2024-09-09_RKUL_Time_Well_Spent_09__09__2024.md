It’s the election season in America. Which drives heavy traffic to short time horizon horse-race sites like the [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net/). But to understand 2024, I think you get as much or more juice out of studying previous elections, as well as America’s cultural and demographic history more broadly. Appalachia’s Scots-Irish regions sharply changed their voting patterns synchronously between 2000 and 2016, but do you know why? There’s the indispensable 1991 [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEKM9C/geneexpressio-20) for that. Why are American libertarians more likely to throw in their lot with the Republican than the Democratic party? For that, you can read [Radicals for Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586485725/geneexpressio-20).

Sara Diamond and Paul Gottfried are both thinkers focused on the rise of post-war conservatism. But in Diamond’s [Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898628644/geneexpressio-20) and Gottfried’s [The Conservative Movement](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805797246/geneexpressio-20) I find a distinctive outsider perspective, from Diamond as a left-wing sociologist, and Gottfried as a right-wing political theorist who rejected neoconservatism. [Roads to Dominion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898628644/geneexpressio-20) is by a more ideological outsider, focusing on how different streams of conservative and reactionary thought converged over the decades into the mature form ascendent by the 1990’s, when Democratic President Bill Clinton declared that the “era of big government is over.” Gottfried’s intellectual pedigree has a dual aspect, from an aspiring insider to an expelled outsider; a pall of ressentiment is detectable in [The Conservative Movement](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805797246/geneexpressio-20), as Gottfried’s distaste for the *arriviste* neoconservatives is palpable. Covering roughly the same periods and same factions, Diamond traces the rise of a triumphal movement, while Gottfried details factional turnovers and transformations.

In 1994, a year before [Roads to Dominion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898628644/geneexpressio-20) and two years after [The Conservative Movement](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805797246/geneexpressio-20)’s second edition, David Frum came out with [Dead Right](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465098258/geneexpressio-20). The book is notable because it called out the hubris and failures of the conservative movement at their peak, in 1994, when Republicans finally took control of the House of Representatives and forced Democrat Bill Clinton to both rule and run for re-election as a center-right candidate. Frum’s basic thesis was that ‌Reaganite politics were more rhetoric than reality. When it comes to foreign policy, with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, movement conservatism achieved a total victory. But in both the economic and social sphere, attempts to roll back the size of government and reverse cultural radicalism failed. Though the government grew more slowly under conservative rule, Frum pointed out that it still grew. Finally, he was also prescient enough to predict that a nationalism conservatism would likely become more powerful in the coming decades.

If [Dead Right](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465098258/geneexpressio-20) was an analytic exercise in prediction that hit its target, John Judis and Ruy Teixeira’s thesis in 2002’s [The Emerging Democratic Majority](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743226917/geneexpressio-20) saw swift vindication in the 2008 and 2012 Democratic victories and refutation in the left’s defeat of 2016. The core argument of [The Emerging Democratic Majority](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743226917/geneexpressio-20) was that structural demographic factors would lend the Democrats a natural advantage over the Republicans, because the former were the “coalition of the ascendant.” That last phrase became popular during the first Barack Obama term, and his 2008 and 2012 victories seemed to confirm Judis and Teixeira’s thesis. But Donald Trump’s 2016 win broke the model, and it is no longer clear that demographics are necessarily on the Democrats’ side. Teixeira, of the Substack [The Liberal Patriot](https://www.liberalpatriot.com/s/the-liberal-patriot-with-ruy-teixeira/archive?sort=new), has argued that a major issue has been a Democratic shift to cultural liberalism that has alienated the core working class support once assumed to be a floor or baseline for any future coalition.

Brink Lindsey’s [The Age of Abundance: How Prosperity Transformed America's Politics and Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QUCO0I/geneexpressio-20) takes us back to the second half of the 20th century, and shows how the era’s economic and cultural dynamism drove political changes on both Left and Right. As a libertarian, Lindsey stands at some remove from partisan factions, and [The Age of Abundance](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QUCO0I/geneexpressio-20) is refreshingly free of cheerleading for either the 1960’s liberal cultural revolution or the right-wing reaction that followed. Rather, the thesis seems to be that in an age when provision of basic human necessities is a given, the political rise and hegemony of post-materialist ideologies was inevitable. The “culture war” politics and polarization we take for granted today really found their incipient form in the 1960’s, as class-based coalitions retained less and less salience in a world of overwhelming prosperity. In some ways, 2024’s politics is the culmination of this trend, as Democrats assimilate more and more well-educated and affluent Republicans and Republicans rebrand themselves as a coalition championing a working-class constituency, previously a Democratic strength.

Finally, Colin Woodard’s [American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0052RDIZA/geneexpressio-20), places modern politics in its historical and geographical context. If political parties are coalitions of constituencies, then constituencies emerge out of local and regional identities and histories. Early 21st-century America is still the land of [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEKM9C/geneexpressio-20), but immigration and the rise of mass pop culture mean that the categories have proliferated from the original four. The results of any election will always reflect dynamics specific to some of Woodard’s given “nations.” For example, in 2020 “El Norte,” the Mexican-American-dominated counties on the US’s southern border, began to shift from a reliably Democrat blue territory to a more purple zone. The continued shift of college-educated suburban Southern whites toward Democrats counterbalanced this. There may not be an overall flip in any given year, but subtle underlying shifts within given factions determine the outcome of elections within an America now politically split down the middle, with little prospects for landslides.

[Ancient East Eurasians and their genetic legacy](https://medium.com/@jacobharr96/ancient-east-eurasians-and-their-genetic-legacy-6b215038fba3). This massive review in *Medium* is worth reading in full, even if some of it is abstruse. The author has an excellent command of the scientific literature, and though translating it to prose that is broadly legible is difficult, the essay richly rewards multiple re-readings.

[Advocates hope Harris will boost momentum on reparations to Black Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/03/kamala-harris-reparations/). This Washington Post story is like a throwback to 2020, and underscores how far some institutions like the media and academia are now out of step with social, cultural and political realities. Racially targeted reparations are extremely unpopular outside of the black community, and Kamala Harris knows most voters are not black. The title is an attempt at wish-fulfillment and illustrates that parts of the media still aspire to drive the news rather than report it.

[Waymo’s new robotaxi will feature fewer sensors to help lower costs](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223655/waymos-new-robotaxi-will-feature-fewer-sensors-to-help-lower-costs). Just when Uber is finally turning a profit, a transformation might be right around the corner for the entire sector of urban transportation, as robot-taxis undercut human drivers. Waymo might be Google [X’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Development) first success, but if it is, it will be a massive one (and out-competing Uber [may not even be](https://singularityhub.com/2024/09/05/waymo-robotaxis-are-giving-100000-rides-a-week-itll-soon-be-more/) its primary goal).

[A Drunken Evening, a Rented Yacht: The Real Story of the Nord Stream Pipeline Sabotage](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/nord-stream-pipeline-explosion-real-story-da24839c?mod=hp_lead_pos7). A few conspirators changed the whole course of geopolitics over the last few years.

[AI Is Coming for India’s Famous Tech Hub](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-is-coming-for-indias-famous-tech-hub-97261085?mod=hp_featst_pos4). AI seems to prove most competitive with low-end service sectors in India and the Philippines.

[The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Rednecks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahq6MF349Fw). No, AI can’t make movies, but it can easily create trailers. I for one would absolutely watch a redneck-reinterpretation of *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

[Reconstructing contact and a potential interbreeding geographical zone between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-70206-y) and [The Persian plateau served as hub for Homo sapiens after the main out of Africa dispersal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46161-7). These two papers posit that Iran was a major secondary modern human *ur-heimat* or “hub.” Not only is the human-Neanderthal admixture likely to have occurred in the central Zagros, but several later expansions to western, northern, eastern and southern Eurasia might originate from this region.

[Number of ancestors and length of identity-by-descent tracks over time](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.28.610091v1?rss=1) and [The ancestry of a genome or The amazing ubiquity of exponential distributions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.30.610585v1?rss=1). These two preprints explore the theoretical and empirical distributions associated with the genealogies and genomes of individuals as you go back in time. Parameters like population history and mating patterns affect these distributions (here is a *Slate* piece I wrote more than a decade ago that scratches the surface, [Which Grandparent Are You Most Related to?](https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/analyze-your-childs-dna-which-grandparents-are-most-genetically-related.html)).

[Genetic associations between non-cognitive skills and academic achievement over development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01967-9?code=3c86a4f0-55c9-48a8-9182-a6e4c60aef6a&error=cookies_not_supported). Heritable elements of your psychology beyond IQ, like self-control, matter more and more to academic performance as you age. Not surprising.

[Archaic introgression and the distribution of shared variation under stabilizing selection](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.20.608876v1?rss=1). Different human populations (Neanderthal vs. modern) have quantitative traits with different optima (e.g., different median heights or muscle mass). When admixture occurs across a large enough genetic distance, the variants associated with these traits in one population are selected against in the other population. This means when Neanderthals and modern humans mixed, the same regions of the genome in both populations, controlling the same traits, were subject to purifying selection that purged genetic variants from the other population. This is one of the ways that modern non-African humans ended up only \~2% Neanderthal even though the original admixture was higher.

There’s still no free lunch, free subscribers; my most in-depth pieces for this Substack remain beyond the paywall. Last month there were three.

First, the second of my pieces on South Asian immigration to the US, [Everywhere you want to be: Indian immigrants in America (part 2 of 2)](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/everywhere-you-want-to-be-indian-1a7):

Next, for a bit of a change-up, [Got milk? Get
-13910\*T](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/got-milk-get-13910t):

> As for lactase persistence’s brief, bizarre co-option by white
> nationalists, any European milk chuggers who like to imagine milk’s
> supposed preference for their race will need to explain why in an
> American context it only looks kindly upon 80% of white Americans,
> loves African Americans next best (about 35% of African Americans
> would be expected to be lactase persistent based on genetic
> admixture), favors a subset of Indian immigrants from the northwest
> corner of the subcontinent at probably even higher rates than white
> Americans, and has absolutely no love for any East Asians, most South
> Asians or any Native Americans. Oh, but prefers some select Arab
> populations and pastoralists from the Horn of Africa at possibly the
> highest rates of all. If lactose tolerance is a referendum on racial
> superiority, someone should let the Masai know they are the natural
> masters of our species. If true, the American far right’s championing
> of milk was a bizarre dalliance. But its improbability doesn’t hold a
> candle to the true patchwork story of how selection pressures on our
> species have been decisively changing our biology to best adapt to the
> specific opportunities our environment offers. And that, like most
> genetic storylines, has unfolded completely without regard for petty
> human hangups about race or anything else.

Then back to a specific national genetic narrative, [Korean identity: a story of genetic continuity 1,400 years in the making](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/korean-identity-a-story-of-genetic):

> The demographic patterns inferred from genetics allow us to finally
> begin to establish a broader meta-narrative that encompasses northern
> Northeast Asia, with Korea in the center. The early history of Korea
> and Manchuria more than 2,000 years ago is known from the annals of
> the Chinese, which record Gojoseon and Jin in the north and south of
> the peninsula, along with other barbarians like the Xianbei, Wuhuan
> and the Buyeo and Yemaek. The ethnographic atlas is spotty and we are
> feeling our way through the retreating darkness, but the arrival of
> genetically Korean-like people to Japan in the first few centuries AD
> confirms the existence of a reservoir of Japonic-speakers in the
> southern Korean state of Jin. Centuries later, these Japonic Koreans
> evolved into the Kaya confederacy. Kaya’s fall to Silla ultimately
> spelled the cultural death knell of the Korea of many peoples. In its
> place arose an enduring Korea of Koreans.
