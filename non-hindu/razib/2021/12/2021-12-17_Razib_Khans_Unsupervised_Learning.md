This week on *Unsupervised Learning* Razib catches up with [Leighton Woodhouse](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/), a documentarian and journalist (with a [Substack](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/)!), to discuss the rise of political polarization and the disintegration of traditional parties and coalitions on both the left and the right. Leighton, whose activism began in 1999 at the [WTO protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests) in Seattle, reflects on the [financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), [geopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) and [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) shocks of the last twenty years, how they’ve transformed the [movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialists_of_America#:~:text=The%20DSA%20is%20the%20largest%20socialist%20organization%20in%20the%20United%20States.&text=Though%20not%20a%20political%20party,House%20of%20Representatives%20as%20Democrats.) he came up in, and the new elitist vs. populist dichotomy he sees developing around him.

Originally a labor organizer and Marxist, he argues that the decline in rigorous debate in favor of moralistic platitudes and ideological conformity is both a symptom and cause of America’s current listless cultural malaise. As someone with an [academic](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-program-sociology) background, Leighton also bemoans universities now sacrificing difficult intellectual discourse on the altar of easy performativity.
