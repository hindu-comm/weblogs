[Richard Hanania](https://richardhanania.substack.com/) is the president
of the [Center for the Study of Partisanship and
Ideology](https://cspicenter.org/) (CSPI). He also runs a
[Substack](https://richardhanania.substack.com/) and a
[podcast](https://audioboom.com/channels/5041684) that are
“must-read/listen.” Richard is perceived as something of a contrarian,
so I wanted to ask him about Israel and its role in American politics
because he has opinions on that topic somewhat outside of the
mainstream.

But since I scheduled this podcast he’s “blown up” due to a piece he
wrote, [Woke Institutions is Just Civil Rights
Law](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/woke-institutions-is-just-civil-rights).
Eliciting responses from the Right and Left, this is the sort of work
that has made Richard’s name. He goes where angels fear to tread. His
profile has certainly gotten higher since I got to know him several
years ago. He was recently on the [Tucker Carlson
show](https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1405701785109491715).

On this podcast we talk about:

-   The incessant attention given over to the Israel-Palestine conflict
    in the USA

-   His thesis that in relation to “wokeness” culture is downstream of
    politics

-   The inevitability of Chinese dominance in the 21st century

-   The mass hysteria in reaction COVID-19

-   What it’s like running a “Think Tank”
