In 1030 AD, the Muslim ethnographer [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni) completed *Indica*, the first work of anthropology about the Indian subcontinent by an outsider. Commenting on the social structure of South Asia, he wrote:

*The Hindus call their castes varna, i.e., colors, and from a genealogical point of view they call them jataka, i.e. births. These castes are from the very beginning only four.*

> *I. The highest caste are the Brahmana...* >
> *II. The next caste are the Kshatriya...Their degree is not much below that of the Brahmana.* >
> *III. After them follow the Vaisya, who were created from the thigh of the Brahman.* >
> *IV. The Sudra, who was created from his \[Brahma\] feet…*

Clearly, already 1,000 years ago outsiders could readily discern the broad lineaments of Indian social structure. But even al-Biruni had much earlier predecessors. In 300 BC, Greek historian [Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes) was an ambassador at the court of Chandragupta Maurya, the ruler of most of India. He too contributed a work entitled *Indica*, and observed that there were seven hereditary and endogamous occupational groups in India, with the most esteemed being the “philosophers.”
