Today on this bonus episode of *Unsupervised Learning* I’m excited to talk to [Patrick Wyman](https://twitter.com/Patrick_Wyman) about his new book, [The Verge: Reformation, Renaissance, and Forty Years that Shook the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08P1MF813/geneexpressio-20).

Full disclosure, I enjoyed [The Verge](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08P1MF813/geneexpressio-20), and a review will be posted from me on [National Review Online](https://www.nationalreview.com/author/razib-khan/) within the next week.

Wyman is the host of [Tides of History](https://www.stitcher.com/show/tides-of-history), a podcast about history and assorted topics which I recommend to everyone (I’ve been a [guest](https://www.stitcher.com/show/tides-of-history/episode/genetics-and-the-transformation-of-prehistory-interview-with-spencer-wells-and-razib-khan-68520164)). If you’ve listened to him speak at length, you won’t be very surprised by the topics and style of writing in [The Verge](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08P1MF813/geneexpressio-20). The narrative does a great job balancing the academic with the engaging.

After reading his book I was curious to ask Wyman about how he wove social and economic history into a persona-driven narrative. We talk at length about the particular details of the significance of the 40-year-period he covers, and whether Martin Luther was a necessary man (as opposed to just being sufficient).

Patrick and I also tackle meta-historical questions such as the importance of “great men” versus forces-of-history, and whether the Protestant Reformation was inevitable due to technological changes. It’s a wide-ranging conversation, so if you are interested in the nitty-gritty of historical processes I think you’ll enjoy it.
