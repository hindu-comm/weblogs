In 1990 a tiny tribe of Native Americans submitted a few blood samples to Arizona State University, ostensibly to look for novel DNA markers which might help them understand why their people were being ravaged by Type-2 diabetes. No-one at the time knew it, but this was one of the opening shots of a decade long conflict between many of the world’s remaining indigenous people, and a small group of scientists who were keen to advance our knowledge of human population genetics, and help sequence the first complete human genome.

Outside of academia there was also a rush to begin patenting and commercialising the new opportunities that biotechnology offered. Private laboratories, pharmaceutical industries and health companies moved into this new wild west, and began mining the frontier’s edge for all it was worth. This is the story of some of that history, culminating in one of the most extraordinary national events - the moment when Iceland essentially sold off its genome, and the incredible fruit that gamble bore.

**Indigenous Blood and Academic Treasure**

The quest to crack the human genome began in 1990, involving 20 different research institutions and companies, mostly based in the USA. One of the initial questions faced by the scientists was, “whose genome are we going to sequence?”. The majority of the DNA used for the Human Genome Project actually came from a still-unknown donor in Buffalo, New York. But the issue of natural human diversity was already in the air, and in 1991 a Stanford population geneticist called Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza began a second project, entitled - the Human Genome Diversity Project - which was an independent attempt to collect genetic information and cell lines from the widest possible range of human groups:

> To investigate the variation occurring in the human genome by studying
> samples collected from populations that are representative of all the
> world's peoples
>
> -1994 HUGO (International Human Genome Organization) Summary Document

The project was explicitly grounded in anti-racism and attempted to create an ethical model to sweep up and capture all the other genetic work being done with indigenous people around the world, to be the standard of best practice and a transparent organisation for human good.

> Human history and the human present is full of racism, xenophobia,
> hypernationalism, and other tragedies stemming from beliefs about
> human populations. In the past, some of those tragedies have been

> grounds. It is unlikely to end it. But it can defeat efforts by

>
> -The Alghero Report & Model Ethical Protocol (HGDP)

Almost immediately the project was attacked by the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI) - a group which was to have great influence and success organising against GM and nanotechnologies. They published a fairly [comprehensive rebuttal](https://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/publication/pdf_file/raficom31patents.pdf) of the Human Genome Diversity Project, breaking down their critiques into problems of ownership, compensation, intellectual property, racism and future threats to the different groups. The Project had indeed selected over 700 different ethnic and tribal peoples to be sampled, and for each group there would be around 50 samples - made up of a cheek swab, hair cuttings and a blood vial. White blood cells would be stored indefinitely.

Despite this, the project did go ahead and was moderately successful. Over 50 groups were sampled, and nearly 150 publications have made use of the data in one form or another. A similar private venture was begun in 2005, the Genographic Project, which was a joint enterprise between IBM and National Geographic. With the advances in DNA sequencing rapidly picking up pace, they seemed to be more successful, and over 1 million people participated as donors around the world.

Both the HGDP and the Genographic Project faced opposition. The latter was criticised by the Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism, who - amongst other things - were concerned that scientists wanted to discredit or undermine indigenous traditional origin stories by proving their ancestors had arrived from somewhere else. They issued a [collective statement](http://www.ipcb.org/issues/human_genetics/htmls/unpf5_collstate.html) rejecting the Genographic Project and recommended that no indigenous group cooperate with the researchers.

This was easier said than done. Although many groups did indeed reject the offer of money for blood samples, some did not, and they often had good reasons. One such group were the Uros people of Peru. This tiny tribe live on floating reed islands on Lake Titicaca, and consider themselves to be the oldest people in the Andes region. Their history with their neighbours was not a happy one, having been invaded and displaced by both the Inca and Aymara. Up until recently their marginalisation made them almost indistinguishable from poor Aymaras, and they took to harvesting reeds on the edge of the lake, building islands to keep themselves safe.

In 2008 they were given the opportunity to test their claim that they were an ancient people when representatives of the Genographic Project offered to sample their DNA:

> During this meeting, the geneticists had excellent news for the Uros:
> their research revealed that the Uros conserved a significant
> differentiated genetic component in their DNA, which was probably
> derived from the ancient Urus. The Uros participating in the meeting

> genomic age (2013) Michael Kent

The power of genetics was on full display, as anthropologists and politicians scrambled to recognise the Uros as a distinct ethnic group with a legitimate claim to their lands. Interestingly their lands turned out to be the lake, of which the Uros managed to secure 40% to themselves, angering other groups who foddered their cattle on the same reed beds.

The Uros were not the only example of indigenous people using the Genographic Project to their own advantage. The north American Melungeons and Seaconke Wampanoag, the Amerindian Charrua, Krenak and Pataxó and groups from both India and South Africa looking for lines of Jewish descent all wanted validation of their identity through the medium of DNA.

**Lies and schizophrenia**

Even whilst the representatives of the Human Genome Project were workshopping their ethical codes, a controversy was brewing in Arizona that would have huge implications down the line. The Grand Canyon Havasupai Indians had been talked into donating blood to a geneticist called Dr Teri Markow by an anthropologist, since they were all coming down with diabetes at an alarming rate. What happened next is so murky and complicated it will never be solved, but we can piece together a few things:

-   Dr Markow received a nearly $100,000 grant from the NIMH (National
    Institutes of Mental Health) and the NARSAD (National Alliance for
    the Research of Schizophrenia and Depression - now called the Brain
    and Behavior Research Foundation) to conduct genetic analysis into
    the dopamine receptor gene.

-   Markow and colleagues presented the Havasupai with a vague medical
    consent form, much of which was difficult to translate accurately

-   The blood samples were analysed for generic HLA immunity gene
    frequencies, [and a paper published in
    1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1682387/pdf/ajhg00055-0155.pdf)

-   No publications or research data about the Havasupai and
    schizophrenia or depression were ever published.

This is confusing stuff. As far as the Havasupai were concerned they had donated blood for research into diabetes, but Dr Markow had received a grant for work on mental health disorders, *which she did not tell the Havasupai*. But she also never used the blood for any mental health research.

In 2003, Carletta Tilousi, a Havasupai tribal member, was invited by an anthropologist to a doctoral student presentation at Arizona State University. As she listened to the young man excitedly discussing DNA microsatellites and populations genetics she raised her hand - “how did you get permission to use Havasupai DNA for your research?”
