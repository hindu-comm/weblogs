Tasmania belongs to that class of locations which sit at the ‘end of the known world’. Along with the Chatham Islands and Tierra del Fuego, it was a last stop for the ever expanding waves of humans before Antarctica. The island separated from the main body of Australia somewhere between 12-8,000 BC, as global sea levels rose in response to the end of the Pleistocene. Aboriginal Tasmanians (*Palawa*) had been living on the island since perhaps 40,000 BC - although the exact dates for Australian settlements as a whole are murky. A land bridge between Australia and Tasmania was slowly engulfed by the seas, prompting cosmological tales of a Great Flood, like many peoples around the world.

As the sea cut the island off from the mainland, the Tasmanians began to move away culturally from the rest of Aboriginal Australia. The extent of these differences was so dramatic that early explorers and later researchers puzzled over whether the Tasmanians represented a branch of the Aboriginal family, or whether they came from elsewhere. They were shorter and had ‘wooly’ or curly hair, in contrast to the straighter hair on the mainland. They also lacked a large number of technologies that their Aboriginal cousins possessed, including:

-   Dingoes

-   Boomerangs

-   Ground or hafted stone tools

-   Spearthrowers / atlatls

-   Bone tools such as needles or awls

Aboriginal Australians in general lacked pottery, the use of bows-and-arrows (with limited exceptions), metal tools and sails, so removing even more from this limited tool kit left the Tasmanians quite destitute in terms of technological capacities. Without hafted tools carpentry becomes very difficult, and without needles it is much harder to make clothing. Tasmanian canoes and vessels seemed to be robust enough to visit nearby islands, but could not possibly have ventured out into open waters.

Beyond the tools and materials themselves, there appears to be three ‘forgetting’ events which have become linked to the supposed decline of Tasmanian culture in general. These are - the loss of making and using bone tools, the abrupt cessation of eating scaled fish and the loss of the ability to make fire. Together these have entered the general academic and wider cultural memory as a kind of warning, that isolated societies could regress so far that they might even forget how to make fire - the ultimate symbol of human mastery over nature.

We will explore each of these in turn.

**The end of using bone tools**

The archaeological puzzle of Tasmania really began as a discontinuity between the anthropological record and the physical objects being dug out of the ground. At a number of shell midden sites, where shellfish, bones and other detritus accumulated over millennia, a clear sequence of events was noted time and again:

> Within the lower units there were numerous bone tools, consisting of
> sharp points and spatulae made from wallaby fibulae, which may have
> been used as awls and reamers, possibly for skin cloaks (60). These
> tools became less numerous as time went on and were absent during the
> last 3.5 kyr. Ethnographically, there is no record of Tasmanians using
> bone tools, and although they used unsewn skins of wallabies over

Other sites recorded the same phenomena, at Sister’s Creek, Little Swanport, Hunter Island and Louisa Bay to name but a few.

> (2016) Allen et al.

For our timeline then, it seems clear that the earliest Tasmanians used bone tools such as projectiles and awls for making clothes from their earliest days. This technology abruptly disappears around 1,500 BC.

**The end of eating scaled fish**

As above, the archaeological exploration of shell middens and other coastal cave sites revealed a sequence of events which changed dramatically around 3,500 years ago.

>
> -Jones, 1995, as above

Both shellfish and seals continued to be consumed, as well as ‘muttonbirds’ or petrel seabirds, which would have provided a rich source of dietary fats.

**The end of making fire**

This astonishing claim, that Tasmanians had to go to their neighbours if their fire ever died out because they could not make one by themselves, must count as one of anthropology’s most persistent myths. The claim originally surfaced after the disease and violence which accompanied European settlement had reduced Tasmanian numbers to a fraction of their original size. Post 1830’s descriptions of Tasmanian customs, languages and lifeways includes the occasional reference to their inability to make fire. This claim was resurfaced by the archaeologist Rhys Jones in the 1970’s, who outlined the theory of cultural degeneration and maladaption, following earlier ideas about the Tasmanians representing an essentially static, Palaeolithic form of life.

Some quotes include:

> James Backhouse, following his journey to Tasmania from 1832 to 1838,
> wrote that the Aborigines 'had no artificial method of obtaining fire'
>
> Thomas Dove, after talking to Aborigines at the Flinders Island
> settlement, concluded in 1842 that “their memory supplies them with no
> instances of a period in which they were obliged to draw on their
> inventive powers for the means of resuscitating an element so
> essential to their health and comfort as flame”
>
> James Calder (quoted by Roth) claimed in 1874 that the Aborigines of
> Tasmania 'were ignorant of any method of procuring fire'
>
> In his 1878 edition of Researches into the History of Mankind, Tylor
> reported that Joseph Milligan, who compiled a significant vocabulary
> of Tasmanian Aboriginal words in 1859, thought, in Tylor's words, 'the
> Tasmanians never produced fire by artificial means at all'
>
> -The polemics of making fire in Tasmania: the historical evidence
> revisited (2008) Rebe Taylor

**Making sense of the claims**

Starting with the easiest - the claim that Tasmanians could not make fire simply has no basis in fact. Not only are there multiple descriptions of the various ways in which they did, but we even have some of their original artefacts.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

One wonderful source of information is the archive of the amateur scientist Ernest Westlake, an Englishman who travelled to Tasmania and produced huge volumes of notes and papers about the people who lived there and their culture. ([You can find out more about his archive here](https://www.mup.com.au/blog/the-ernest-westlake-archive)) He recorded nearly 100 conversations with different Tasmanians in his papers, and 27 of them include detailed descriptions of their firemaking techniques. These include percussive methods, fire-sticks, drills, boards and all the nuances of which plants and woods to use and when.

However - the recurring insistence on this idea of a loss of fire making skills is shouldered by the ubiquitous references to Tasmanians carrying bundles of fire sticks with them, and relighting fires using sticks from other camp sites. There are several points to be made here. Firstly, Tasmania is a damp environment, full of cold rainforest, regular rainfalls and coastal winds - hardly ideal for fire lighting. Seasonal fire making may have been the norm, rather than ad hoc, given the weather conditions. Secondly, the art and practice of fire lighting has rarely been utilitarian. Prometheus is not the only deity who stole fire, and control over who can make fire and when can be a matter of great secrecy. Paradoxically the use of fire to burn the rainforest, to provide more ideal hunting and living territories, seems to have been perfected around the time (2000-1500 BC) that bone tools and fish disappear in the record.

Jones’ argument has become infamous within Australian archaeology for its blunt characterisation of Tasmanian culture as undergoing a tragic spiraling decline into oblivion. For Jones, the absence of other more advanced toolkits such as hafted and ground tools already marked out the Tasmanians as a people who were ‘stuck’ in a rut. The decision to reject fishing and bone tool manufacturing was, in his schema, a path to destruction.

However, despite the simple toolkit, and perhaps even an ability to make fire during the wet season, it is possible to interpret the Tasmanian situation as stable, rather than declining. The taming of the rainforest may have made it possible for them to begin exploring the islands around Tasmania. All evidence for occupation on Hunter and Maatsuyker Islands seems to have occurred *after* the loss of bone tools and fish, and there are suggestions that the Tasmanian canoe was a relatively recent invention, propelled by increasing access to good shorelines.

Archaeologist Harry Allen critiqued Jones as early as 1979, pointing out that the move from protein-rich scaled fish to fat-rich seals and seabirds made good economic sense. In a similar vein researcher Ron Vanderwal argued that bone tools were primarily used for making clothing, and that moving from fur clothes to layers of grease and ochre applied to the skin was simply more efficient. It could be that all these new adaptations were bound together - access to the sea meant more emphasis on fat and fatty animals which in turn prompted an economic reorganisation away from fishing to sealing and seabird harvesting. This is speculative of course, but it is worth exploring the hypothesis that these ‘losses’ in technology were no necessarily maladaptive. Many other hypotheses have also been put forward, including a mass poisoning event from some kind of toxic bloom prompting a new food taboo, but we lack more focused archaeology from the present to confirm or deny any of these.

**Conclusions**

It would take a much longer set of articles to do justice to the full archaeology and anthropology of Tasmania, including the languages and different waves of arrivals. However, in addressing the narrow claims of technological losses I think we can make the following conclusions:

-   The Tasmanians never lost the ability to make fire, but they may
    have struggled to make it all year round

-   Their toolkit was extremely limited in comparison to Australian and
    global hunter-gatherer technological repertoires.

-   Somewhere around 3,500 years ago there was a switch from fishing and
    making bone tools to a different economic mode.

-   One can read the archaeology of Tasmania as a story of cultural
    decline, but other alternatives are available.

Tasmanians do occupy a unique and rather tragic place in archaeological history. Most early theorists wanted to read into them a just-so story of Darwinian evolution and a warning story of cultural decline. We should be fair and balanced here - they were an extremely isolated population with a very limited set of technologies, but they were not as limited as some have made them out to be.
