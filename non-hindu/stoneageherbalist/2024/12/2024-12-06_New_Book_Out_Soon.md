My first book, *Berserkers, Cannibals & Shamans: Essays in Dissident Anthropology*, came out over a year ago now - a self-published collection of writings about the weird and wonderful worlds of anthropology and archaeology, where academics fear to tread. I didn’t expect it to sell so well, or to be sent reviews and pictures of it on university library shelves, or accompanying people on holiday. Typically university researchers can expect to see maybe [300 copies of their books sold](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/sep/04/academics-are-being-hoodwinked-into-writing-books-nobody-can-buy), and even then mostly to their own students. By contrast I’ve sold many times that, without any marketing department or publishing team. Not to exaggerate my own importance here, but no-one other than me can promote my own successes. I think it speaks to the exhaustion of the mainstream scholarly world when an anonymous oddity with just a twitter account and a blog can outsell the average researcher. Something has gone wrong.

But we are where we are, and today I’m delighted to announce that my next essay collection will be available on Amazon shortly. The book will have all my best articles from the last year, including paywalled pieces and some new material. Hopefully it will make an intriguing present for another oddity in your life.

I’ll promote the book when it is released, watch this space!
