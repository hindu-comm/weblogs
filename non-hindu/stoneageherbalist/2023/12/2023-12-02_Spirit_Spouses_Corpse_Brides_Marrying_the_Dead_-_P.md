------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marrying the dead, whether by legal fiction or physically exhuming a corpse to stand at a ceremony, is just one half of the spirit spouse phenomenon. We now turn to the more ephemeral and unsettling realities, where people engage in relationships and sexual activity with a *spirit*, or a ghost, or a demon. For European readers familiar with elements of late medieval or early modern Christianity, there are parallels here with the *incubi* and *succubi*. Similar creatures or malevolent beings are staples of folklore all over the world, generally manifesting as a shapeshifter or violent and ugly spirit who sexually assaults and rapes both men and women: the *tikoloshe* of Zimbabwe; the Swahilian *Popobawa*; the Chilean *Trauco* and so on. For this article we’ll explore a few lesser known examples where such relationships are consensual, to some degree, rather than involving a named being. We start with the Yoruban spirit husbands, then look at Afro-Brazilian demon spouses, and end with Siberian shamanic beliefs in spirit spouses.

**Yoruban Spirit-Husbands**

*“During sleep the spirit seems to desert the body, and as in dreams we visit other localities and even other worlds, living as it were, a separate and different life, the two phenomena are not unnaturally regarded as complements of one another…”*

This quote from Sir John Lubbock, the esteemed archaeologist and anthropologist, helps explain the basic dualism found among almost all peoples - that there is a world of the living and awake, and another, which connects to the dead and the invisible. What Lubbock does not explain though, is how someone could engage in romance and even sexual activity with a spouse *who was never alive to begin with.* This is the position some women in Nigeria find themselves in, being married to a living, breathing husband during the day, and then having a separate marriage to a spirit spouse while asleep.

The Yoruba of West Africa are one the largest ethnic groups on the continent. Their home, Yorubaland, stretches across Togo, Benin and Nigeria. The Yoruba, like many of their neighbours, possess a complex animistic and polytheistic religion, one which shares features with the Vodun (Voodoo) tradition. Their belief in the Orisha deity pantheon, the ability for spirits to enter the world through childbirth and the importance of the ancestors has had a profound effect on global religion - in particular through the syncretism of Yoruba cosmology in the Americas leading to the development of Umbanda, Santería, Candomblé and many other belief systems. The permeability of the spirit world for the Yoruba often leads to all kinds of trouble - many spirits, demons and mischievous entities can enter the life of a person, such as an *abiku* child, who wishes to constantly be reborn and so dies during infancy as a human baby, only to reincarnate again and again, bringing misery to the mother.

Alongside these spirits is the universal phenomenon of witchcraft, typically performed by females amongst the Yoruba, sometimes translated as *aje*. Nocturnal attacks by witches can result in a form of dream-time warfare known as *ogun-oru*, where an individual might be tormented in the early hours of the morning by magical forces.

An interesting combination of both these aspects of Yoruba culture is the phenomenon of the ‘spirit husband’ or occasionally ‘marine husband’ (*oko orun*). This arises from the belief that a man and woman can be married in the spirit world, and that sometimes a man will allow the woman to enter the physical world. He will continue to visit her, to have sex with her, even to impregnate her. But he might also torment her, become jealous of her earthly husband or make her barren.

The advantages of this system for some women are obvious - being happily married to a good spirit husband might prevent her from being married off to someone she doesn’t like, or she can enjoy a personal and private satisfaction that others can’t interfere with. However, many women do not want the attention of these husbands, and go to great lengths to be rid of them. A quick internet search reveals hundreds of Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn and other social media pages offering relief from the *oko orun.* Worse still are the potential physical side effects of spirit spousal conflict, which can turn into an exhausting protracted form of nocturnal combat:

Despite Christian and Islamic inroads into Yoruban culture, belief in spirit husbands continues, and both preacher and imam struggle to cast out these devils and djinns from their faithful. Nigeria might be a relatively prosperous and modern country by African standards, but the spirit world still breaks through and torments its denizens, by both night and day.
