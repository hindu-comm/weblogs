At the time I wasn’t aware of the tumult in the culture and the technology scene that that had caused. Video games were just fun, not the *it* thing I suppose. Perhaps as an analogy it would be like getting online in the early 2000s, after the dot-com crash of 2000. The internet by then was a normal part of everyday life, but the excitement and cultural omnipresence abated.

In that context the original NES took center stage rather slowly and organically in the mid-1980s, eventually triggering the competition between Sega, TurboGrafx, Nintendo, and later Sony. I got off that particular train when I was about seventeen, seeing the amount of time that the hobby swallowed. But I couldn’t help but be amused by this article in *The New York Times*, [Nintendo’s New Console May Feed Your Nostalgia, if You Can Get One](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/business/nintendos-new-console-may-feed-your-nostalgia-if-you-can-get-one.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below):

> “He’s 40 years old and grew up with a Nintendo,” Ms. Bradbury said. > “It’s a nostalgia thing.”
