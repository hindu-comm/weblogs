It was getting sort of cluttered. Also, the new theme should look better on mobile.

Not sure how long Twitter will be around, but as long as it’s around, make sure to [follow me](https://twitter.com/razibkhan).

I’m personally opposed to a term like “atheist Muslim,” because a Muslim by definition to me is not atheist. But the author, [Ali Rizvi](https://twitter.com/aliamjadrizvi), is an interesting fellow.

Going to try and get to [Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005HFI0X2/geneexpressio-20) before Christmas. Don’t know if I’ll get to it, but it’s been on my “to-read” list for a while.

Has anyone ever thought that the novel [Musashi](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CD428BU/geneexpressio-20) was somewhat reminiscent of Cúchulainn? No idea why I think this, but it’s always been on my mind…

I think someone keeps asking about South Asian genetic signatures in Southeast Asia, and I keep forgetting to respond to them. I think there was old (say Iron Age) gene flow from South Asia to various parts of Southeast Asia (basically the cores of Hindu-Buddhist archaic semi-historical polities such as Angkor era Cambodia), and, also more recent gene flow due to colonialism era migration mediated by Europeans. Also, I suspect there was more gene flow from early Holocene Southeast Asia into South Asia than we currently comprehend.

Why? Probably because universal liberal democracy seems less assured as the final stationary state of society in all places now than it did then. It’s an interesting book in part because it attacks the global cultural element with which it is probably easiest to identify me with.
