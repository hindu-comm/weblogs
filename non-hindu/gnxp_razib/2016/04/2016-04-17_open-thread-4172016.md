But it is not this day. And yet it shall come to pass that I’ll make room for finishing [The Shape of Ancient Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20). Say what you will about e-books, but that you can have someone’s magnum opus for \$20 is a good thing.

My daughter improvised a song about me. It begins: “I’m a brown guy.” But there is a line where she says “I work a lot.” Obviously having issues with work-life balance. People always say that at the end of their life they wish they had spent more time with their loved ones.

[Estimating Basal Eurasian](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2016/04/estimating-basal-eurasian-ancestry.html). Remember, some of the devisors of “Basal Eurasian” admit it may just be a useful construct….

A lot of people are talking about [The Green Room](http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/review-the-green-room-is-less-than-its-parts.html). I grew up in Oregon. And not Portland (rather, the eastern parts). I know that the Pacific Northwest makes for a good setting for these sorts of films because of the gloomy ambience and the real presence of white nationalists, but really their presence is all but invisible. Don’t get the wrong impression from these sorts of films.

Here is an intro video from the company I’m working for:

Still trying to get used to humidity again. There’s a reason people live in California. [In Cramped and Costly Bay Area, Cries to Build, Baby, Build](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html?_r=0).

The owner says that the high tech features won’t eliminate labor, but it’s pretty clear that this is where it’s going (and not a moment too soon in light of minimum wage hikes!).

I’m excited to be going to the [Evolution Meeting](http://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2016---austin-texas.html) in June in Austin. Should be a change-up from ASHG.

[The Aerogram](https://twitter.com/theaerogram/status/721828143728836608) uses an illustration which depicts a woman in a niqab, presumably as a Muslim. I’ve noticed this pattern on other progressive websites. This strikes me as really strange because even many practicing and believing Muslims of a non-liberal religious persuasion (e.g., my parents) find the niqab to be extreme and somewhat disturbing. The difference from the hijab is simple: not being able to see someone’s face in a public situation is alarming, especially when they can see you. All part of the weirdness of the tight embrace between Islam and political liberalism/progressivism in the West. Sometimes my (liberal) friends are curious why I’m conservative. One answer is that I can’t align with people who align with people who would look the other way while [I was killed](http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-another-bangaldeshi-blogger-hacked-to-death-for-posting-against-radical-islamists-2199188). It’s pretty simple. I’d rather be \#problematic than dead.

Kind of confusing going between Mac and Ubuntu at home, but perhaps I will finally get an [iPhone](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00VHSXBUA/geneexpressio-20) instead of the next [Edge](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CJU9BBM/geneexpressio-20).
