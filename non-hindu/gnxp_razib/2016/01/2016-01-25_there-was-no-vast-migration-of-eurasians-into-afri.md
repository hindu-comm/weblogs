There was no vast migration of Eurasians into Africa

Last fall while at ASHG this paper came out, [Ancient Ethiopian genome reveals extensive Eurasian admixture throughout the African continent](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/10/07/science.aad2879):

> Characterizing genetic diversity in Africa is a crucial step for most > analyses reconstructing the evolutionary history of anatomically > modern humans. However, historic migrations from Eurasia into Africa > have affected many contemporary populations, confounding inferences. > Here, we present a 12.5x coverage ancient genome of an Ethiopian male > (‘Mota’) who lived approximately 4,500 years ago. We use this genome > to demonstrate that the Eurasian backflow into Africa came from a > population closely related to Early Neolithic farmers, who had > colonized Europe 4,000 years earlier. **The extent of this backflow > was much greater than previously reported**, reaching all the way to > Central, West and Southern Africa, affecting even populations such as > Yoruba and Mbuti, previously thought to be relatively unadmixed, who > harbor 6-7% Eurasian ancestry.

Turns out that there was a bioinformatics error which negates the magnitude of these results. [Erratum to Gallego Llorente et al. 2015](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26978112/Erratum%20with%20figures.pdf):

First, **scientists are humans and mistakes happen.** So respect that the authors owned up to it. On the other hand, **the conclusion never smelled right to many people.** I was confused by it. I asked Iosif Lazaridis at ASHG. He was confused by it. I asked Pontus Skoglund. He was confused by it.

Unfortunately the result from the bioinformatics error was emphasized on the abstract, and in the press. In [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/science/scientists-sequence-first-ancient-human-genome-from-africa.html):

> **“The most astonishing thing is there’s quite a lot of backflow in > all modern African populations,”** Dr. Pinhasi said. He and his > colleagues estimate that 7 percent of the genomes of the Yoruba people > of Nigeria are of Eurasian origin.

A rule of thumb in science is when you get a shocking and astonishing result, **check to make sure you didn’t make some error along the sequence of analysis.** That clearly did not happen here. The blame has to be distributed. Authors work with mentors and collaborators, and peer reviewers check to make sure things make sense. **The idea of massive admixture across the whole of Africa *just did not make sense*.**

If something like this happened to me I’d probably literally throw up. This is horrible. But then again, this paper made it into *Science*, and *Nature* wrote articles like this: [First ancient African genome reveals vast Eurasian migration](http://www.nature.com/news/first-ancient-african-genome-reveals-vast-eurasian-migration-1.18531). The error has to be corrected.
