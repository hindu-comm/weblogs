I’m skeptical “indigenous Arabs” are basal Eurasians

[Indigenous Arabs are descendants of the earliest split from ancient Eurasian populations](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/01/11/gr.191478.115.abstract):

This is a good paper. They’ve taken a stab at it, and are very circumspect. But in the end they state that “these two conclusions therefore point to the Bedouins being direct descendants of the earliest split after the out-of-Africa migration events that established a basal Eurasian population.”

To catch everyone up, [Lazaridis et al.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/04/05/001552) suggested based on results from ancient DNA that many West Eurasian populations have an ancestry which derives from a lineage basal to all other non-Africans unmixed with this population. That means that the genetic distance of this group to Pleistocene European hunter-gatherers and Pleistocene Australians is the same, while the genetic distance between these two groups is smaller than between them and this population. Therefore they are termed “basal Eurasians,” or bEu.

But it is also important to note that they are a construct. The ancient DNA has not found any unmixed basal Eurasians. This is in contrast to other groups which are used as donor populations: European hunter-gatherers and Siberian hunter-gatherers. About \~50% or so of the ancestry of the Anatolian farmers who were the precursor of the first agriculturalists in Europe derive from bEu ancestry, with the balance consisting of a heritage similar to to European hunter-gatherers. The hunter-gatherers recently discovered in the Caucasus also have this bEu ancestry. Ergo, **almost all West Eurasian and South Asian populations have bEu ancestry.**

In the paper above, which is open access, the authors found a group of Qatari Bedouin, who seem to have low admixture from Africans or other Middle Eastern groups. Though some preliminary analysis was done with SNP-chips, they went whole genome for most of the work (allowing them to look for rare variants, etc.). **I would have been convinced to a great extent if they put a TreeMix graph out which showed that their indigenous Arab population was a good donor to ancient Anatolians along with European hunter-gatherers.** But I did not see that. Or they could have done an F4 ratio test showing that the Bedouin were more basal Eurasian than any other modern population. I did not see that.

I did see an F4 ratio test for Neanderthal admixture. I am not confident that their assertions hold. Take a look at the pattern of Neanderthal admixture in the supplements; it’s all over the place. It isn’t in line with the broad patterns found in the latest work out of David Reich’s lab.

There are also some assumptions within the paper which I think are untenable. They seem to be positing a continuity of these Qatari Bedouin within the Arabian peninsula for tens of thousands of years. The divergence of the bEu population, putatively ancestral to these Bedouin, occurred from other non-Africans even before the settlement of Australia, over 50,000 years ago! I don’t think it is likely that the Bedouin were resident in or around the Arabian peninsula for that long.

Finally, there’s some reference to effective population sizes vs. X and autosome. This isn’t a major part of the paper, but I would be skeptical of these sorts of claims. There is a lot of work in this area, and it turns out everything is way more clouded than you might think on first blush.

Overall, **good paper.** But there’s still a mystery here. The only solution is clearly more ancient DNA from this region.
