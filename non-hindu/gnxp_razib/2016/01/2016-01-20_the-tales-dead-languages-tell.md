The tales dead languages tell

> Ancient population expansions and dispersals often leave enduring > signatures in the cultural traditions of their descendants, as well as > in their genes and languages. The international folktale record has > long been regarded as a rich context in which to explore these > legacies. To date, investigations in this area have been complicated > by a lack of historical data and the impact of more recent waves of > diffusion. In this study, we introduce new methods for tackling these > problems by applying comparative phylogenetic methods and autologistic > modelling to analyse the relationships between folktales, population > histories and geographical distances in Indo-European-speaking > societies. We find strong correlations between the distributions of a > number of folktales and phylogenetic, but not spatial, associations > among populations that are consistent with vertical processes of > cultural inheritance. Moreover, we show that these oral traditions > probably originated long before the emergence of the literary record, > **and find evidence that one tale (‘The Smith and the Devil’) can be > traced back to the Bronze Age.** On a broader level, the kinds of > stories told in ancestral societies can provide important insights > into their culture, furnishing new perspectives on linguistic, genetic > and archaeological reconstructions of human prehistory.
