Details on the back of the envelope

![panam-09-back](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/panam-09-back-300x172.jpg?resize=300%2C172)![panam-09-back](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/panam-09-back-300x172.jpg?resize=300%2C172)Years ago when I was noticing specific population genomic estimates I asked a friend about the confidence intervals, and how much to trust the values therein. One thing he mentioned offhand is that linkage disequilibrium based estimates of time since admixture often seem to give a relatively low figure in terms of generations. When it comes to non-human organisms in the field one doesn’t know always the demographic history, but with humans we have better records, and I too have noticed that the dates seem extremely skewed toward the recent. Part of this is accounted for by the dodge that these estimates are often sensitive only to the last pulse of admixture. But even then….

A new preprint discusses in detail why this occurs, [The Effects of Migration and Assortative Mating on Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/31/056168):

The intuition isn’t that difficult. Assortative mating in this case often means that within population there are going to be correlations of segments of genomic ancestry which are the patterns you are tracking to infer backward the initial admixture. The dynamic of the mating, random or not, is going to effect the shape of decay over time. If you see more dense local ancestry tracts in individuals because of positive assortative mating, you may confuse it in your model for very recent admixture.

This sort of thing crops up in all sorts of models. Assortative mating within a population may lead to higher heritable transmission of a trait across generations than you might expected. Many of the model based clustering algorithms which generate the bar plots now ubiquitous in admixture analyses assume Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in one’s populations.
