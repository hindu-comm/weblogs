Rage against the machines

A lot of the argument seems straight out of the kind of things I’ve heard from friends involved in [CrossFit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit). Much of the piece disparages machines:

> By contrast, traditional gym movements are geared to the lowest > cognitive denominator: bicep curls, crunches, reading Us Weekly while > plying the elliptical. Weight machines, by design, entirely remove > skill from the equation: They are intended to offer the untaught user > a way to lift.

I think machines are fine for some people. I have a friend who likes to work out on machines in a solitary fashion, and that’s what’s sustainable for him. It’s definitely better than nothing. For me, the transition to body weight exercises has been transformative in terms of maintaining a basal level of fitness. I work a lot so getting to the gym is not something I’ve found time for in a while, but I regularly do [pull ups](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002Y2SUU4/geneexpressio-20) before work and when I come home. In fact I have my [pull up stand](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002Y2SUU4/geneexpressio-20) right next to my front door so that I see it every day.

In the 1980s, as noted in the piece, there was a focused on extreme size, as you might find among body builders, especially in action films. Today the focus is on a [lean look](http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/building-a-bigger-action-hero-20140418).

In past decades there wasn’t as much focus on fitness in American culture. I think part of this probably had to do with the fact that so many people worked on the farm. They engaged in physical labor as a matter of course. And there are cross-cultural differences as well. Traditionally the civilian Chinese elite class avoided strenuous exercise. In contrast, the militarized ruling classes of Greek and Rome idealized a more rugged physique.

And of course the United States has a schizophrenic attitude on this issue. There is a whole cult of fitness, where few manage to hit their targets, but most aspire to. And then there is also a movement toward “body acceptance,” which is basically a backlash.
