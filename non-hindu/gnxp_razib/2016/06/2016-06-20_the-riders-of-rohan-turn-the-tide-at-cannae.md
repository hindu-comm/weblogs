The Riders of Rohan turn the tide at Cannae

[![18925629.\_UY200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/18925629._UY200_.jpg?resize=130%2C200)![18925629.\_UY200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/18925629._UY200_.jpg?resize=130%2C200)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0304352845/geneexpressio-20?_encoding=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20)The show runners of [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007BVMVDU/geneexpressio-20) (the HBO television which will actually complete its run under its original creators) admitted that they patterned part of the battle in yesterday’s episode on the [Battle of Cannae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae). This was obvious to me, as I was actually thinking that the Boltons were exhibiting something similar to the Carthaginian [double envelopment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer_movement). Pretty cool synthesis of a callback to [The Two Towers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0039TAHMA/geneexpressio-20?_encoding=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20), as well as integrating real history.\*

If you want to read a great description of Cannae, I’d recommend Adrian Goldsworthy’s [The Punic Wars](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0304352845/geneexpressio-20?_encoding=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20).

\* Somewhat anachronistically, as the phalanx formation was used by the Romans, and perhaps not the Carthaginians.
