There are probably no cognitive benefits to bilingualism

About one week ago I wrote about [bilingual education](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/bilingual-education-is-operationally-bad-for-the-children/), and I admitted my mild skepticism about the research about the benefits of bilingualism. A friend emailed me and wondered why I was only “mildly skeptical.” Partly I didn’t want the comments to get sidetracked, but recently friends on Facebook have started to get exercised that [Ron Unz](http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article66525082.html) is running for the Senate, and how bad he is for not giving the children the opportunity to be bilingual. And of course all the research that confirms how great bilingualism is referenced.

So here’s an article from last month that my friend sent me. I’ll quote the appropriate section, you’ve seen this movie before, [The Bitter Fight Over the Benefits of Bilingualism: For decades, some psychologists have claimed that bilinguals have better mental control. Their work is now being called into question](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/):

The proponents of bilingualism as a cognitive benefit have reacted angrily. Read the whole thing. But it’s probably not a real strong effect if there is any at all. Just another battle in the replication wars….
