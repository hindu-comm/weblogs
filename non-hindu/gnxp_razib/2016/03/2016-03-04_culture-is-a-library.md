Culture is a library

Obviously software engineering on big projects continues apace. But for many quick & dirty tasks instead of laboriously (or frankly, not so laboriously) assembling together a script often a precise query into [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) suffices. It reminds me of the universe of David Brin’s [Uplift saga](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036S49KU/geneexpressio-20).

In that universe there is a [Galactic Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_Universe#Technology), which basically allows sentient species to not need to reinvent the wheel. Humans are unique because of their need to *understand* the technology that they use. At the time I found the premise interesting…but after reading Joe Henrich’s [The Secret Of Our Success](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WY4OXAS/geneexpressio-20), I have come to think that the galactic civilization which Brin depicts is simply an extrapolation of our own technological world. Much of our life is a magic “turn-key” black-box. It is probably self-evident that average humans don’t know how computers or even automobiles work. **But Henrich points out that even customs such as manner in which indigenous American peoples detoxify [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava#Food_use_processing_and_toxicity) is “encapsulated” from conscious understanding.** The “galactic library” is just a metaphor for the crutch that is social cognition.

Cultural [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)#An_information_hiding_mechanism) is not a bug, it’s a feature….
