[![k9871](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/k9871-197x300.gif?resize=197%2C300)![k9871](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/k9871-197x300.gif?resize=197%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691155313/geneexpressio-20)I haven’t talked about [Warriors of the Cloisters: The Central Asian Origins of Science in the Medieval World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691155313/geneexpressio-20) much since I read it, and haven’t had time to blog it. I don’t really accept the thesis in the subtitle, but it’s a really good work which illustrates the importance of what some would term “cultural appropriation.” The [“recursive argument method”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1lnr0j/this_book_is_about_the_medieval_scientific_method/) seems common sense today, in that it is distilled through the blood of scientific discourse, but it does in hindsight seem like a very important invention. Anyway, I would recommend the book.

I’ve been doing work with a firm [Embark](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP58389) recently. Two of the co-founders are [giving talks](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP58389) at *South by Southwest* on Tuesday morning (also, I guess this is my ‘disclosure’ of interests, which is feasible now that it’s coming out of ‘stealth mode’).

Mike Lynch has a piece in *Genetics*, [Mutation and Human Exceptionalism: Our Future Genetic Load](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/3/869). Haven’t had time to read it. Though since he is the guy behind “mutational meltdown” presumably he’s given the topic some thought.

Graham Coop has a note up on bioRxiv, [Does linked selection explain the narrow range of genetic diversity across species?](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/07/042598). To a great extent it is a rejoinder to [Natural Selection Constrains Neutral Diversity across A Wide Range of Species](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002112). Worth reading both. I suspect that the answers will be resolved in the next 5-10 years. Coop makes a persuasive case that selection is not the primary constraint though.

[SJWs Will Elect Trump](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/social-justice-warriors-will-elect-trump/). It strikes me that Donald Trump is facing major structural headwinds in the general election. But aggressive behavior at his rallies to shut them down are going to *help* him because the majority of people in this country (including me) don’t have much sympathy for the antics of campus activists and Left radicals.

[How Saudi Arabia Turned Its Greatest Weapon on Itself](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/opinion/sunday/how-saudi-arabia-turned-its-greatest-weapon-on-itself.html?smid=tw-share). I’m old enough to remember the tail end of the OPEC years of oil and glitter. We’re in a very different age.

[To Maintain Supply of Sex Slaves, ISIS Pushes Birth Control](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/world/middleeast/to-maintain-supply-of-sex-slaves-isis-pushes-birth-control.html). Remember, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” There some kinks along the way….

[In South Sudan, City of Hope Is Now City of Fear](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/world/africa/south-sudan-civil-war.html). I remember some friends on Facebook being very happy about South Sudan’s independence. Yes, the South Sudanese should have gained their independence, rather than remaining shackled to Sudan. But it seemed pollyannish to assume that this was not a nation that would have a long and rocky road ahead.

[No remorse from administrators in Duke lacrosse rape hoax](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-remorse-from-administrators-in-duke-lacrosse-rape-hoax/article/2585599). Remorse would imply university administrators have emotions. I haven’t seen evidence of this personally.

[Turning Anthropology from Science into Political Activism](http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=3330). Why do we fund anthropology departments at public universities again? (“we” as in all of us outside of the Left, from liberals all the way to the Right)

[Genomics of Rapid Incipient Speciation in Sympatric Threespine Stickleback](http://www.pubchase.com/article/genomics-of-rapid-incipient-speciation-in-sympatri-by-marques-da-lucek-k-e-plos-genetics-26925837).

[San Jose Is The Most Forgettable Major American City](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/san-jose-is-the-most-forgettable-major-american-city/). It’s one big suburb.

[Samsung Galaxy S7 Review: Head of the Smartphone Class](http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s7-review-head-of-the-smartphone-class-1457445927).
