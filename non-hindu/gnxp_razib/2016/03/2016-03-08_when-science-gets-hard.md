When science gets hard

You may know that there is a reproducibility crisis in psychology. Or is there? [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/psychology-crisis-whether-crisis/) and [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html) both have pieces up reviewing the current debates on whether there is, or isn’t, a crisis. Perhaps the media is biased, but the behavior and explanations who assert there **isn’t a crisis** seems informative to me. From the *Wired* piece:

> Emotions are running high. Two groups of very smart people are looking > at the exact same data and coming to wildly different conclusions. Science hates that. This is how beleaguered Gilbert feels: **When I asked if he thought his defensiveness might have colored his interpretation of this data, he hung up on me**.

And now, from *Slate*:

> In his lab, Baumeister told me, the letter e task would have been > handled differently. First, he’d train his subjects to pick out all > the words containing e, until that became an ingrained habit. Only then would he add the second rule, about ignoring words with e’s and nearby vowels. That version of the task requires much more self-control, he says. >
> Second, he’d have his subjects do the task with pen and paper, instead of on a computer. It might take more self-control, he suggested, to withhold a gross movement of the arm than to stifle a tap of the finger on a keyboard. >
> If the replication showed us anything, Baumeister says, it’s that the > field has gotten hung up on computer-based investigations. “In the > olden days there was a craft to running an experiment. You worked with > people, and got them into the right psychological state and then > measured the consequences. There’s a wish now to have everything be automated so it can be done quickly and easily online.” These days, he continues, there’s less and less actual behavior in the science of behavior. “It’s just sitting at a computer and doing readings.”

Of course even those who accept and promote a replication crisis **often feel their own unreplicated work is an exception to the rule.** Basically what this is telling us is that psychologists are subject to the sorts of cognitive biases they themselves study. Some researchers though seem to be facing the problems head-on, [Reckoning with the past](http://michaelinzlicht.com/getting-better/2016/2/29/reckoning-with-the-past):

Or do we use those bias tests Joe Hilgard is so sick and tired of to point us in the right direction? What should I stop teaching to my undergraduates? I don’t have answers to any of these questions. >

What is not helping is the lack of acknowledgement about the severity of our problems. What is not helping is a reluctance to dig into our past and ask what needs revisiting.

From what I have hear psychological experiments are relatively cheap. Replication is feasible, even if it’s not glamorous. In contrast in biomedicine replication is more expensive. There might therefore be bigger problems lurking out there….
