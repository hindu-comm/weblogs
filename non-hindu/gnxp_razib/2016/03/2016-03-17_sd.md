Celts from the Atlantic

> But over the last decade, a growing number of scholars have argued > that the first Celtic languages were spoken not by the Celts in the middle of Europe but by ancient people on Europe’s westernmost extremities, possibly in Portugal, Spain, Ireland or the other locales on the western edges of the British Isles. >
> Koch, the linguist at the University of Wales, for example, proposed in 2008 that “Celtic” languages were not imports to the region but instead were developed somewhere in the British Isles or the Iberian Peninsula — and then spread eastward into continental Europe. >
> … >
> Moreover, in recent years, some archaeologists have proposed that the > traditional story of the Celts’ invasion was, in a sense, exactly wrong — the culture was not imported but exported — originating on the western edge of Europe much earlier than previously thought and spreading into the continent. >
> In a 2001 book, Cunliffe, the Oxford scholar, argued on the basis of > archaeological evidence that the flow of Celtic culture was opposite > that of the traditional view — it flowed from the western edge of > Europe, what he calls “the Atlantic zone” — into the rest of the continent. In many places of the Atlantic zone, he notes, people were buried in passages aligned with the solstices, a sign that they shared a unified belief system. >
> “From about 5,000 B.C. onwards, complicated ideas of status, art, cosmology were being disseminated along the Atlantic seaways,” Cunliffe said, and that culture then spread eastward.

The paper they’re alluding to is [Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/368.abstract).
