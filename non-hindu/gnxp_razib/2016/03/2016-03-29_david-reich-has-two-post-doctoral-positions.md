David Reich has Two Post-doctoral positions

It has recently come to my attention that [David Reich](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/Reich_Lab/Jobs.html) has two post-doctoral positions open which might interest readers of this weblog. Since I really enjoy writing about the research that his lab produces it is in my interest that he find the right people to work on the projects that he has. **If you are one of those rare people in the world who has a background in history *and* statistical population genetics or data science this might be for you!** Here are the [listings](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/Reich_Lab/Jobs.html), ignore the deadline date as they have been extended:

> **1) Post-doctoral fellow: Ancient DNA** >
> Our ancient DNAlaboratory has pioneered large-scale studies of human > population history with large numbers of samplessimultaneously and we are looking for a highly motivated post-doctoral researcher with appropriate experienceand interests to work on analysis of these data. >
> The successful candidate will have previous experience in a world class ancient DNA laboratory, as well asanalytical and computer skills that allow exploration of large and complex genetic data sets. >
> Description of additional projects in our lab, as well as papers we have recently published, is provided[here](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reichlab/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html "http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reichlab/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html"). >
> The position will be supervised by Dr. David Reich. >
> Please write to reich at genetics \[dot\] med \[dot\] harvard \[dot\] edu by March 1, 2016 if you are interested. >
> **2) Post-doctoral fellow: Learning about history using genetic data** >
> We are searching for a highly motivated post-doctoral researcher to join our group. >
> The successful candidate will have exceedingly strong statistical / > mathematical / computational skills, andan interest in history. While > a background in population genetics, bioinformatics or experimental > biology isadvantageous, it is not necessary. Our lab has the resources to not only analyze large public data sets, butalso has access to some of the world’s best new genetic data, whether generated by collaborators or in ourown laboratory. Possible projects are: >
> • Studying human history using data from present-day populations >
> • Studying human history using ancient DNA >
> • Studying the process of speciation and the mechanisms of natural selection and mutation using genetic data >
> Description of projects in our lab, as well as papers we have recently published, is provided[here](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reichlab/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html "http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reichlab/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html"). >
> The position will be jointly supervised by Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson, and will involve work atboth Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. >
> Please write toreich at genetics \[dot\] med \[dot\] harvard \[dot\] eduby March 1, 2016 if you are interested. >
