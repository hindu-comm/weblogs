What little we know about megafauna

[![Elephasantiquus](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Elephasantiquus.jpg?resize=600%2C449)![Elephasantiquus](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Elephasantiquus.jpg?resize=600%2C449)](http://www.nature.com/news/elephant-history-rewritten-by-ancient-genomes-1.20622)

Ewen Callaway reports from a conference in England, [Elephant history rewritten by ancient genomes](http://www.nature.com/news/elephant-history-rewritten-by-ancient-genomes-1.20622):

> Modern elephants are classified into three species: the Asian elephant > (Elephas maximus) and two African elephants — the forest-dwellers (Loxodonta cyclotis) and those that live in the savannah (Loxodonta africana). The division of the African elephants, originally considered a single species, was confirmed only in 2010. >
> Scientists had assumed from fossil evidence that an ancient predecessor called the straight-tusked elephant (Paleoloxodon antiquus), which lived in European forests until around 100,000 years ago, was a close relative of Asian elephants. >
> In fact, this ancient species is most closely related to African > forest elephants, a genetic analysis now reveals. Even more > surprising, living forest elephants in the Congo Basin are closer kin > to the extinct species than they are to today’s African savannah-dwellers. And, together with newly announced genomes from ancient mammoths, the analysis also reveals that many different elephant and mammoth species interbred in the past. >
> …  
> Palkopoulou and her colleagues also revealed the genomes of other > animals, including four woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and, for the first time, the whole-genome sequences of a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) from North America and two North American mastodons (Mammut americanum). >
> The researchers found evidence that many of the different elephant and > mammoth species had interbred. Straight-tusked elephants mated with > both Asian elephants and woolly mammoths. And African savannah and > forest elephants, who are known to interbreed today — hybrids of the > two species live in some parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere — also seem to have interbred in the distant past. Palkopoulou hopes to work out when these interbreeding episodes happened.

15x coverage. This is awesome. And incredible.
