What’s going on?

The comments below make me unsure about the influence of the Frankfurt School on modern socio-political movements, but the ideal of a utopian end state for society which enshrine a vision of the good definitely seems to be one of the things that moderns have lost. Rather, a lot of identity politics talk seems to be about positional games and status competition. The perpetual revolution.

At the suggestion of a reader I purchased [Explaining Postmodernism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00480P9H2/geneexpressio-20). The [Kindle version](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00480P9H2/geneexpressio-20) is \$4.99.

There was an ancient DNA convention in England. It turns out that the original Polynesians may not have had much Melanesian ancestry, implying multiple migrations into Far Oceania.
