The Neandertal-modern cultural synthesis

[![220px-Pointes_de_chatelperron](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/220px-Pointes_de_chatelperron.jpg?resize=220%2C190)![220px-Pointes_de_chatelperron](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/220px-Pointes_de_chatelperron.jpg?resize=220%2C190)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2telperronian)A new paper in *PNAS*, [Palaeoproteomic evidence identifies archaic hominins associated with the Châtelperronian at the Grotte du Renne](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/13/1605834113.abstract), weighs in the question of whether the [Châtelperronian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2telperronian) culture were Neandertals, with an answer in the affirmative in this case:

The details about stratigraphy are beyond me. But the protein and mtDNA evidence is pretty conclusive in my opinion that there are Neandertal individuals in this assemblage. Therefore, assuming their stratigraphy is correct, what you see in the Châtelperronian may be a cultural influence upon Neandertals by anatomically modern humans who were pushing into Europe at this time.

In [The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465002218/geneexpressio-20) [Greg Cochran](https://westhunt.wordpress.com/) hypothesized that Châtelperronian culture may have been a vector for Neandertal genes coming into modern human populations. And now we know that this isn’t always [one directional](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/neandertal-toe-contains-human-dna). That is, just as modern humans absorbed genes from “archaic” populations, so archaic groups absorbed ancestry from modern populations (or at least humans closer to the main stem of modern humanity).

But one dynamic we need to remember about these tribes is that they also had a lot of European ancestry, in part because of the rapidly unbalanced population sizes. **It seems entirely likely, as some have posited, that the last “Neandertal” populations were also substantially admixed.** Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that they would also tend to exhibit cultural features more commonly found among modern humans.

My prediction is that when whole genomes of Châtelperronian Neandertals are available it is highly likely that they often show evidence of modern human ancestry.

**Note:** Diamond’s [The Third Chimpanzee](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060845503/geneexpressio-20) is in my opinion a very underrated work. It is a bit dated today, but I still think it is quite worth reading.
