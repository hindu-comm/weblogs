Endings & new beginnings

[![Screenshot 2016-11-27 20.15.36](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-27-20.15.36.png?resize=100%2C96)![Screenshot 2016-11-27 20.15.36](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-27-20.15.36.png?resize=100%2C96)](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/)It’s been exactly three years since I moved on from *Discover*. Change is timeless. So I thought it would be a good time to announce the move to another project today.

**Until further notice this is my last post as a blogger at*Unz Review*.** Just aswhen I left *Discover*, this shouldn’t impact regular readers very much in terms of substance and content. As always you can follow me through my RSS feed, <http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed>, Twitter,[http://twitter.com/razibkhan](https://twitter.com/razibkhan), and of course, my website,[http://www.razib.com](http://www.razib.com/)(I’m surprised how many people bookmark that website, as I got some emails when I changed the formatting).

If you are old school and just want to bookmark and check the site to see when it goes live, this will work:

If you have a blog, please update your link to:[http://www.gnxp.com/WordPress](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/). It will help me with getting some [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)(I’m also going to point the front page of <http://gnxp.com> to the new site).

There will be some changes and flux. I’m starting “my own thing” over at [N of Everyone](http://nofe.me/), where I’m working with some friends to develop a new way of disseminating science to the masses. That is, I’m not just going to be a blogger, but am taking an active role in running the shop. A few of the big ideas motivating this move can be found in the piece I coauthored with David Mittleman from a few years back, [Dragging scientific publishing into the 21st century](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0556-2). Soexpect the newest iteration of[Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/)to be somewhat more experimental in terms of playing around with feature set and evolving more over time.

Also, honestly I’m not sure that Twitter will be around in its currentform in another five years, so the [Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/)at[N of Everyone](http://nofe.me/)is going to be my attempt to create an independent platform so that I can communicate to who I want to communicate without relying on intermediaries…indefinitely (as long as I’m interesting in doing this, my professional path is definitely going to remain in science so I can express my opinions honestly without having to toe party lines).

**Addendum:** I’ll be moderating comments here for a bit as long as stray threads continue as long as Ron lets me continue with my permissions, but eventually I’ll stop checking.
