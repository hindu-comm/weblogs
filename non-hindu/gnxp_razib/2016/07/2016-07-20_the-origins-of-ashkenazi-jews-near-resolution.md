[The Time and Place of European Admixture in the Ashkenazi Jewish History](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/10/063099?rss=1%2522):

I think this preprint is coming close to the answer. Why does a small ethno-religious minority in Europe matter? Well, that’s a matter of historical contingency.

In any case, there were some good papers on Ashkenazi Jewish genetics which came out in the spring of 2010. They really moved the ball forward from the uniparental work. But they suffered from two major problems. First, **the putative “parent” populations of Ashkenazi Jews are not that genetically distinct**. Second, the hypothesized parental populations were often implausible; e.g., Northern Europeans and modern Levantines.

The likely parental populations of Ashkenazi Jews are Roman period peoples of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly the swath of territory from Alexandria up to Anatolia, and, the peoples of the western Mediterranean. That is, Levantines and Iberians & Italians. These two groups are distinct, but they’re not **that** distinct.

Additionally, the more and more we learn about the Middle East, the more likely it seems that Muslim populations, who are often modeled as a parental group, are highly cosmopolitan compared to ancient groups. Recall that Neolithic farmers from the Levant resemble Sardinians more than they do locals, because of later migration from further east in Eurasia, as well as later African gene flow. Using imperfect reference populations will probably skew the results appropriately.

The major change in the past few years is the usage of more genetic information than common genotypes. This paper for example looks at haplotype information. Sequences of variants across the genome. This preserves more recent genetic variation. In other cases you can look at whole genome sequences, and focus on low frequency variants which are extremely informative of recent population differentiation.

Ultimately the only reason I’d suggest that this paper is lacking is the imperfection of Middle Eastern source populations. That’s probably increasing the European and decreasing the Middle Eastern fraction somewhat on the margins. The contemporary populations of the Near East have changed a fair amount over the past 2,000 years, though there is still some continuity.
