Yellowbird hot sauce should engage in some truth in advertising

[![Yellowbird-Hot-Sauce-98-Oz-Combo-Pack-0-0](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Yellowbird-Hot-Sauce-98-Oz-Combo-Pack-0-0.jpg?resize=499%2C500)![Yellowbird-Hot-Sauce-98-Oz-Combo-Pack-0-0](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Yellowbird-Hot-Sauce-98-Oz-Combo-Pack-0-0.jpg?resize=499%2C500)](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00TBFMXGE?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20)  
[Yellowbird](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00TBFMXGE?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) is a pretty good hot sauce. As you can see it gives you quantity, and the quality is decent. But there’s a major problem with the serrano and habanero brands.

According to the [scoville scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#Peppers) the habanero is about 10 times spicier than the serrano. That sounds about right to me. So if you buy a habanero sauce, it should be around 10 times spicier, right? Well, not exactly since a sauce has other ingredients. **But, it should be considerably spicier, at least.**

That’s not what I perceive in the [Yellowbird](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00TBFMXGE?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) brand. **The serrano sauce is nearly as spicy as the habanero line.** What’s going on? If you look at the ingredients serrano is listed first for its sauce, but habanero is not first. Carrot is first. A lot of hot sauces use carrot puree in their sauces, but I find that a lot of “habanero” sauces overwhelm you with carrot flavor so that you can say you bought a habanero sauce, without tasting much habanero.

I suspect that that [Yellowbird](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00TBFMXGE?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) adds a lot more serrano to that lien than they add habanero to that sauce. So the label is *officially* accurate, but when you buy the two sauces they are not that different in spice levels, because the concentration of capsaicin is actually pretty close.

Overall I would say that the [habanero sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00TBFMXGE?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) isn’t worth it. The [Yellowbird serrano](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Man-Genetic-Odyssey/dp/B00X8PAPL8?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) though is a good sauce. Because there’s **a lot** of pepper there is a fresh green flavor to it, and it’s not so sweet as some hot sauces. Like most good hot sauces there’s an astringency, but it doesn’t overpower.
