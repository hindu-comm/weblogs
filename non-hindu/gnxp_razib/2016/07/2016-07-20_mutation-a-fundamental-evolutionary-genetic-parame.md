Mutation, a fundamental evolutionary genetic parameter

[The mutation rate in human evolution and demographic inference](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/29/061226.abstract):

> The germline mutation rate has long been a major source of uncertainty > in human evolutionary and demographic analyses based on genetic data, > but estimates have improved substantially in recent years. I discuss > our current knowledge of the mutation rate in humans and the > underlying biological factors affecting it, which include generation > time, parental age and other developmental and reproductive > timescales. There is good evidence for a slowdown in mean mutation > rate during great ape evolution, but not for a more recent change > within the timescale of human genetic diversity. Hence, pending evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to use a present-day rate of approximately 0.5 x 10−9 bp−1 yr−1 in all human or hominin demographic analyses.

Even since this review came out there has been new work. Fast changing.
