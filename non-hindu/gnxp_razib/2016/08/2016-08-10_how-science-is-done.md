How science is done

A follow up on the [Ancient Archaic Admixture Into the Andamanese](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/ancient-archaic-admixture-into-the-andamanese/) story, [No evidence for unknown archaic ancestry in South Asia](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/08/068155):

> Genomic studies have documented a contribution of archaic Neanderthals > and Denisovans to non-Africans. Recently, Mondal et al. 2016 (Nature > Genetics, doi:10.1038/ng.3621) published a major dataset–the largest > whole genome sequencing study of diverse South Asians to > date–including 60 mainland groups and 10 indigenous Andamanese. They > reported analyses claiming that nearly all South Asians harbor > ancestry from an unknown archaic human population that is neither > Neanderthal nor Denisovan. However, the statistics cited in support of > this conclusion do not replicate in other data sets, and in fact > contradict the conclusion.

Last I heard they hadn’t released the bam files. Mistakes are made, that’s how science is done, and other people help in the process of correction. **But, it is starting to get worrisome to me to see papers with bioinformatic errors being published in high impact journals.**
