Sanjeev is a polymath with varied interests, some of which intersect with my own.

I don’t think we look that much alike!

[The top start-up mecca in America is far from Silicon Valley](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/11/austin-is-top-place-for-startups-in-america-not-silicon-valley.html). It’s cheap to live here, and fun for young brogrammers. Also, not too long a flight from elsewhere.

Bought [Python Essential Reference](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672329786/geneexpressio-20).

[Hubby and Lewontin on Protein Variation in Natural Populations: When Molecular Genetics Came to the Rescue of Population Genetics](http://www.genetics.org/content/203/4/1497?rss=1).

[Sausage Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage_Party) is a surprising mix of high and lowbrow.
