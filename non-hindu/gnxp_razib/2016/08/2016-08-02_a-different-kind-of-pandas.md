A different kind of pandas

[![pydata_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pydata_cover-228x300.jpg?resize=228%2C300)![pydata_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pydata_cover-228x300.jpg?resize=228%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Roads-Gene-Land-Collected/dp/B009NLMB8Q?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20)For the past few days I’ve been using the [Python data analysis library](http://pandas.pydata.org/), or “pandas.” Most of the time I work with [Perl](https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Roads-Gene-Land-Collected/dp/B007S291SA?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20), [R](https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Roads-Gene-Land-Collected/dp/B00683GXUO?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20), and [shell scripting](https://www.amazon.com/Narrow-Roads-Gene-Land-Collected/dp/B0043GXMPW?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20). But the Perl/R combination has gotten to be pretty unwieldy recently, and some of my coworkers swear by pandas. So in the interest of firm cohesion I converted to their sect. Honestly it wasn’t hard, as I’ve always enjoyed *reading* Python code, though I haven’t written much before.

If Python aficionados have other recommendations, I am open to them.

If I need do to text processing fast & in a pinch, I can still see falling back on Perl. And R is still a great environment to work in, I won’t be uninstalling RStudio anytime soon.
