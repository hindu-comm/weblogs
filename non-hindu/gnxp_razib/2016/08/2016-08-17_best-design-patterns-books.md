Best Design Patterns Books

[![51szD9HC9pL.\_SX258_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/51szD9HC9pL._SX258_BO1204203200_-238x300.jpg?resize=238%2C300)![51szD9HC9pL.\_SX258_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/51szD9HC9pL._SX258_BO1204203200_-238x300.jpg?resize=238%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEIBB8/geneexpressio-20)Obviously I’m doing more development right now than I would have expected. But in the long term I want to move beyond hacking to survive for the present, and write some code that’s sustainable. So I think I want to read a design patterns book. The last one I read was 15 years ago and I don’t really have much retention of it. I’m particularly interested in stuff geared toward Python (the language I’m starting to get comfortable in right now).

Readers with recommendations are invited to weigh in. I know I have a fair number of software engineers in the readership, so I’m asking for your thoughts and suggestions. Perhaps [the classic](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEIBB8/geneexpressio-20) from the GoF is still the way to go? Remember, I’m not a software engineering who works on scientific data, I’m a scientists who sometimes needs to do a little engineering and data analysis.

**Note:** Sean, if you take this as an opportunity to leave a long-winded comment about sexual selection and blond women, again, I’m going to have to finally ban you!
