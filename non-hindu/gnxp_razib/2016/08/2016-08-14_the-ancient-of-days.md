The ancient of days

[![85251766_fea18b6004](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/85251766_fea18b6004.jpg?resize=300%2C213)![85251766_fea18b6004](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/85251766_fea18b6004.jpg?resize=300%2C213)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_shark)Probably the most incredible science story of the week, [Eye lens radiocarbon reveals centuries of longevity in the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6300/702):

> The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), an iconic species of > the Arctic Seas, grows slowly and reaches \>500 centimeters (cm) in > total length, suggesting a life span well beyond those of other > vertebrates. Radiocarbon dating of eye lens nuclei from 28 female > Greenland sharks (81 to 502 cm in total length) revealed a life span > of at least 272 years. Only the smallest sharks (220 cm or less) > showed signs of the radiocarbon bomb pulse, a time marker of the early > 1960s. The age ranges of prebomb sharks (reported as midpoint and > extent of the 95.4% probability range) revealed the age at sexual > maturity to be at least 156 ± 22 years, and the largest animal (502 cm) to be 392 ± 120 years old. Our results show that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate known, and they raise concerns about species conservation.

Elisabeth Pennisi has a nice write-up, [Greenland shark may live 400 years, smashing longevity record](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/greenland-shark-may-live-400-years-smashing-longevity-record):

> …Using this technique, the researchers concluded that two of their sharks—both less than 2.2 meters long—were born after the 1960s. One other small shark was born right around 1963. >
> The team used these well-dated sharks as starting points for a growth > curve that could estimate the ages of the other sharks based on their > sizes. To do this, they started with the fact that newborn Greenland > sharks are 42 centimeters long. They also relied on a technique > researchers have long used to calculate the ages of sediments—say in > an archaeological dig—based on both their radiocarbon dates and how > far below the surface they happen to be. In this case, researchers > correlated radiocarbon dates with shark length to calculate the age of > their sharks. The oldest was 392 plus or minus 120 years, they report > today in Science. That makes Greenland sharks the longest lived > vertebrates on record by a huge margin; the next oldest is the bowhead whale, at 211 years old. And given the size of most pregnant females—close to 4 meters—they are at least 150 years old before they have young, the group estimates.
