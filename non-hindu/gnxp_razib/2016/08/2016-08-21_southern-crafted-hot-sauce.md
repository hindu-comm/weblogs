Southern Crafted Hot Sauce

[![20160821_152743 (1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160821_152743-1.jpg?resize=300%2C701)![20160821_152743 (1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160821_152743-1.jpg?resize=300%2C701)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160821_152743-1.jpg)I got this hot sauce at Whole Foods. The *original* Whole Foods.

What a disappointment. Salty. Without much other flavor besides the spice. It was like a watery spin on Louisiana hot sauce. I couldn’t taste the “aromatic spices” and “fresh herbs.” And don’t tell me it is because it’s too spicy, I didn’t find it too spicy. I did find it very salty though.
