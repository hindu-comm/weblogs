Genetic structure matters

[![killerenhancedcolourscheme](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/killerenhancedcolourscheme-300x298.jpg?resize=300%2C298)![killerenhancedcolourscheme](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/killerenhancedcolourscheme-300x298.jpg?resize=300%2C298)](https://paintmychromosomes.blogspot.com/2016/08/paper-writing-in-age-of-preprints-and.html)Recently Daniel Falush’s group came out with a preprint, [A tutorial on how (not) to over-interpret STRUCTURE/ADMIXTURE bar plots](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/28/066431). If you read the science posts on this weblog (basically, if you read this weblog), and you haven’t read it, **read it now.**

At his weblog, [Paint My Chromosomes](https://paintmychromosomes.blogspot.com/2016/08/paper-writing-in-age-of-preprints-and.html), Falush has talked about both the production of the preprint (I had a minor stimulatory role), and the attempt to get it published somewhere. This reaction is strange to me:

Of course I’m biased. But this strikes me as crazy. The third most cited paper in the history of the journal *Genetics*, is Jonathan Pritchard’s [Inference of Population Structure Using Multilocus Genotype Data](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/945). Take a [look at the list](http://www.genetics.org/articles/most-cited), and note the papers that it is more cited than (e.g., a Sewall Wright paper from 1931, and Tajima’s 1989 paper!).

To be sure, **the number of times that a paper is cited is not a good measure of how often it is read and understood.** And that’s kind of the point of Falush’s preprint, to actually give some guidance to people who use model based clustering in a turnkey fashion without any deep comprehension of its limitations and biases. The nuts & bolts of the inferences of population structure may be specialized, but analysis of structure is a routine part of many different types of papers, in particular in medical genetics where variants may have different effects in different genetic backgrounds.
