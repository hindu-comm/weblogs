Population genetics in the post-molecular age

From the abstract:

> We describe the astonishing changes and progress that have occurred in > the field of population genetics over the past 50 years, slightly > longer than the time since the first Population Genetics Group (PGG) > meeting in January 1968. We review the major questions and > controversies that have preoccupied population geneticists during this > time (and were often hotly debated at PGG meetings). We show how > theoretical and empirical work has combined to generate a highly > productive interaction involving successive developments in the > ability to characterise variability at the molecular level, to apply > mathematical models to the interpretation of the data and to use the > results to answer biologically important questions, even in nonmodel > organisms. We also describe the changes from a field that was largely > dominated by UK and North American biologists to a much more > international one (with the PGG meetings having made important > contributions to the increased number of population geneticists in > several European countries). Although we concentrate on the earlier history of the field, because developments in recent years are more familiar to most contemporary researchers, we end with a brief outline of topics in which new understanding is still actively developing.

Charlesworth & Charlesworth are giants in the field, and theyâ€™ve a lot of changes over the past few decades. If you are inclined toward a deeper exploration of population genetics with an evolutionary focus, then [Elements of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/Separate-Creation-Biological-Origins-Orientation/dp/0981519423?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=geneexpressio-20) is the book for you.
