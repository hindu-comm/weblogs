A Portrait of the Blogger as a Young Man

![artist](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/artist.jpg?resize=300%2C547)![artist](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/artist.jpg?resize=300%2C547)At the moment I am taking a break between non-internet related professional obligations. No real time to write something interesting, though I now plan to write a post with the tentative title of “the pagan *kafir* origins of Islam.” This, inspired by my quick reading of [Warriors of the Cloisters: The Central Asian Origins of Science in the Medieval World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691155313/geneexpressio-20). I figured I should read this book before getting to [The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20). All part of my attempt to practice what I preach in obtaining a wide portfolio of quasi-competencies.

I have probably posted the picture to the left before. I don’t know. I was four years old in it. I’ve been revisiting old pictures of myself as my own children have been maturing. I can see my daughter particular right now when I look at these images. It’s all rather strange.

(for those of you curious as to my severe mien, it’s a cultural norm not to smile too much in pictures in Bangladesh, at least during that period)
