Google searches for the secret sauce of asabiyyah

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below):

> **As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two > behaviors that all the good teams generally shared.** First, **on the > good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion**, a > phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution > of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during > each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from > assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, > everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got > a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one > person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective > intelligence declined.’’ >
> Second, **the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — > a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt > based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal > cues.** One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show > someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what > the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the > Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in > Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in > the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or > left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below > average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward > their colleagues.

Google also found that **shared norms matter, but the details of the norms vary a great deal across high performing teams.** Combine this with a modicum of a relatively flat egalitarian structure and enough social feedback mechanisms for the team to operative like an organism, and you have a “hive mind.” Of course, teams at a firm like Google are already selected for much more intelligent than average individuals, so there might be reasons why these factors loom so large, as the sum-of-the-parts are roughly equivalent across the company.
