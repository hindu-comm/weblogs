Silicon Valley has an Asian-people problem

![Twitter workforce breakdown](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/twitterethnicitychart.jpg?resize=625%2C308)

[![diversity_brief_fig2](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/diversity_brief_fig2.jpg?resize=201%2C444)![diversity_brief_fig2](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/diversity_brief_fig2.jpg?resize=201%2C444)](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/report/2012/07/12/11938/the-state-of-diversity-in-todays-workforce/)The above statistics on the labor force at Twitter compared to the overall labor force **indicate that non-Hispanic whites are underrepresented in tech firms in Silicon Valley.** This is true [overall in prominent tech firms](http://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/). 51% of Facebook’s employees are non-Hispanic whites.

So how to make sense of these sorts of articles: [ Twitter’s White-People Problem](http://www.thenation.com/article/twitters-white-people-problem/)? And what about passages such as this which seem to totally defy statistical/demographic reality:

>  But while Twitter the platform is bustling with all types of racial > diversity, Twitter the company is alarmingly white. >
> Twitter isn’t alone. **Most of the biggest tech companies in Silicon > Valley are overwhelmingly white** and male. While blacks and Latinos > comprise 28 percent of the US workforce, they make up just 6 percent > of Twitter’s total US workforce and six percent of Facebook employees.

Of course this is just a lie. Very few people would say a workforce that is 50 to 60 percent white, true of both Google and Microsoft, is “overwhelmingly white.” In fact, it’s less non-Hispanic white than the US labor force as a whole. I’ve linked to statistics in this very piece. They take about 10 seconds of browsing search queries to understand this.

But you don’t need to know statistics. Eat at a Google cafeteria. Or walk around the streets of Cupertino. **There is no way that one can characterize Silicon Valley as overwhelmingly white with a straight face.** Silicon Valley is quite diverse. The diversity just happens to represent the half of the human race with origins in the swath of territory between India and then east and north up to Korea.

The diversity problem isn’t about lack of diversity. It is about the right kind of diversity for a particular socio-political narrative. That’s fine, but I really wish there wasn’t this tendency to lie about the major obstacle here: people of Asian origin are 5% of the American work force, but north of 30% in much of the Valley. If you want more underrepresented minorities hiring fewer of these people would certainly help. In particular the inflow of numerous international talent coming from India and China could be staunched by changes to immigration law.

But these are international companies. Though they genuflect to diversity in the American sense (blacks and Latinos), ultimately they’ll engage in nominal symbolic tokenism while they continue on with business, with an increasingly ethnically Asian workforce and and increasingly Asian economic focus. Meanwhile, the press will continue to present a false caricature of a white workforce because that’s a lot more of a palatable bogeyman than Asian Americans and international tech migrants, and the liberal reading public seems to prefer the false narrative to engaging with reality.

**Addendum:** The first article was in *The Nation*. Take a look at their [masthead](http://www.thenation.com/masthead/). Most of the names I recognize are mighty, perhaps even alarmingly, white….
