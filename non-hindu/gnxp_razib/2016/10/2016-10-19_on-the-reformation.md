On the Reformation

[![MacCulloch_Reformation_sm](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MacCulloch_Reformation_sm-195x300.jpg?resize=195%2C300)![MacCulloch_Reformation_sm](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MacCulloch_Reformation_sm-195x300.jpg?resize=195%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AWGIRPW/geneexpressio-20)Since we’re on the topic of religion, I thought I would make a book recommendation. If there is one book I would read on the Reformation if there was one book, it is Diarmaid MacCulloch’s [The Reformation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AWGIRPW/geneexpressio-20). I read this magisterial work in 2004 over a week and it has stuck with me in a way no other work on this topic before or since, has (similarly, if you are going to read one book on Byzantine history, it would be [A History of the Byzantine State and Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804726302/geneexpressio-20)).

MacCulloch’s [history of Christianity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0030CVQ5I/geneexpressio-20) was relatively disappointing (thin gruel, stretching out a deep topic too far in a survey). But I see he’s come out with a new book on an old topic, [All Things Made New: The Reformation and Its Legacy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01J86B2NA/geneexpressio-20). I just got a copy and it seems interesting. More thematic than narrative in comparison to the earlier survey.
