Eczema as an outcome of an ancient sweep

Though luckily I’ve never had an issue with acne, most people who know me personally are aware that I suffered from extreme eczema as a child. Most of the major issues occurred when I was under five years of age, and in my first few years, so I have only minimal first hand recollection. The problem runs in my family, though I was the most extreme sufferer. Eczema also [correlates](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518213939.htm) with asthma, something I also suffer from.

Naturally I was curious about this new paper in *Genome Biology*, [Atopic Dermatitis Susceptibility Variants In Filaggrin *Hitchhike* Hornerin Selective Sweep](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/26/gbe.evw242):

This shows the importance of whole genomes, as the earlier result correlation variation to climate seems to be due to ascertainment bias in terms of SNP discovery. Additionally, it’s intriguing that the haplotype which eczema-like diseases are associated with is very ancient. It’s found in Africans, and ancient genomes. So it’s been segregating in human populations for a while. That indicates some sort of balancing selection going on, so that it’s never purified.

What they found is that in Chinese samples there has been a recent positive sweep. I don’t really buy their conclusion that the haplotype wasn’t found in European hunter-gatherers, they don’t have a large enough sample. But it does seem to be a case where there is balancing selection maintaining standing genetic variation, which purified may be selected for or purified in some populations.

This may be a more common dynamic than we might realize. Many complex diseases may exhibit risk profiles due to being dragged up in frequency because of associations with a nearby region, or, a genetic-correlation where the positive benefit is greater than the negative.
