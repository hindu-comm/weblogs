Not as well paced as his previous [After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires, 1400-2000](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596916028/geneexpressio-20), but pretty good nonetheless.

Politics exhausts me. This is an exhausting time for me mentally as I’m overwhelmed by the din of political chatter and fixation. I’m very excited for November 8th to come and go.

There’s lots of stuff in science I want to write about, but the combination of lack of time, and politics saturation all over the place, has been demotivating me. So as the month proceeds I’ll probably get my energy back.
