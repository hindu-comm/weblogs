More than can be imagined in your models

These maritime peoples seem to have emerged from the islands of Taiwan, and pushed forward south, west, and east, so that their expansion pushed to East Africa, and the fringes of South America. There now also some [circumstantial](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)01274-3?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982214012743%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) [evidence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214012202) that Polynesian contact with the Americas predates the Columbian Exchange. Looking at the map above in hindsight it seems natural to imagine such contacts.

Though **where** the Austronesians went is incredible, their origins are somewhat more opaque, but rather tantalizing. That is because their original expansion was likely just before the horizon of history. In [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/geneexpressio-20) Jared Diamond alluded to the [“express train” vs. “slow boat”](https://www.ganino.com/games/Science/science%20magazine%202001-2002/root/data/Science%202001-2002/pdf/2001_v291_n5509/p5509_1735.pdf) models of the expansion. Basically, whether the Lapita peoples rapidly pushed out from Taiwan, or whether there was a long period of coexistence with Melanesians in Near Oceania. Over the past few years genetics seems to have supported the “slow boat” model.

Here is a paper from 2012, [Population Genetic Structure and Origins of Native Hawaiians in the Multiethnic Cohort Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047881):

We set K = 2 and estimated in 40 100% Native > Hawaiians an average of 32% and 68% of their genomes to be derived > from Melanesian and Asian origins, respectively (Figure 4). **This notable proportion of Melanesian admixture (32%) among Native Hawaiians, substantially greater than zero, lends support of the “Slow Boat” model of ancestral origins.**

This is not an isolated study. Y chromosomes indicate substantial Melanesian admixture, while the mtDNA does not. One inference then was a “slow boat” model predicated on matrifocality. That is, expanding Polynesian groups were centered around matrilineal lineages, and absorbed Melanesian men into their communities. The above research was from a Hawaiian data set, but the results are consistent across Polynesia in relation the proportion of Melanesian ancestry.

Case closed? No so fast! **Ancient DNA has now been brought to the question, and fundamentally changed our perceptions.** [Genomic insights into the peopling of the Southwest Pacific](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19844.html):

These results strong indicate that the original Lapita migration **did not** mix with Melanesians. And, the ancient samples share common ancestry with modern Polynesians, so that their heritage persists down to the present. Looking at the distribution of Melanesian ancestry they concluded this admixture occurred on the order of \~1,500 years before the present (their intervals were wide, but the ancient samples serve as a boundary). Additionally, in line with the Y and mtDNA the X chromosome indicated more of the ancient ancestry than the autosome. The authors conclude that “it is also possible that some of these patterns reflect a scenario in which the later movement of Papuan ancestry into Remote Oceania was largely mediated by males  
who then mixed with resident females.”

The take home message than is that **we need to be more modest with our models.** Without ancient DNA it seems likely that we would not have stumbled onto this result; the ancestry deconvolution methods which date admixture have wide confidence intervals when you go back far in time.
