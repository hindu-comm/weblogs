California Olive Ranch, the real deal

[![California Olive Oil](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cor_sample_bottle.jpg?resize=176%2C388)![California Olive Oil](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cor_sample_bottle.jpg?resize=176%2C388)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0099Q87JM/geneexpressio-20)About a month ago I was listening to the host of [America’s Test Kitchen](http://www.americastestkitchen.com/), [Christopher Kimball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Kimball), talk about olive oil on the radio. I’m aware that **most of the “extra virgin olive oil” we buy in this country is basically fradulent.** A [study](http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/research/files/report041211finalreduced.pdf) came out of UC Davis on this several years ago, but it’s long been an open secret. It doesn’t really matter much if you use olive oil to cook, as a lot of the flavor disappears in that process anyhow. Rather, it matters if you use olive oil as dressing on salads and such. I do. Still, as I have a rather unrefined palette I’ve usually plunked down for the biggest container I could find. Yes, even [Bertolli](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WHPNI0/geneexpressio-20). But Kimball was asked by the host about his preferred brand, and he offered [California Olive Ranch](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0099Q87JM/geneexpressio-20), which also came out high on the UC Davis study, though to be fair the firm apparently had a hand in the funding. This extra virgin olive oil is often described as having a strong aromatic taste, almost pungent. I don’t mind strong tastes, so I ordered some on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0099Q87JM/geneexpressio-20).

Probably because my taste sensitivity has been modulated by my high consumption of spices I felt that that the tangy aspect some mention was rather subtle. The oil is very “clean,” and leaves less of a cloying taste in my mouth than what I’m used to. Though I’m conscious of the fact that this might be a subjective perception of the fact that I know that someone with refined tastes prefers this olive oil, I’ve decided to make the switch and made a large order. I’d be curious what olive oil readers prefer.
