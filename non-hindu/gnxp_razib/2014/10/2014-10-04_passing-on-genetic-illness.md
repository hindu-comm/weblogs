Passing on genetic illness

I appreciate that the author disavowed the clichés whereby parents of children with disabilities or illness reflect upon what a learning experience it was or is. But with [preimplantation genetic diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis) The author could indeed have predicted the outcome today, as opposed to 15 years ago. What would her choice be now? I suspect she would choose to implant only those zygotes which lack the mutation (it seems that it is an autosomal dominant). These are discussions we as a society need to have, and my hope is that the two sides avoid clichés and don’t attempt to shout the other side down. I doubt we’ll be doing much PGD for blue eyes or height, but lots of these sorts of congenital illnesses which are due to major deleterious mutations are going to disappear. Switching to normative mode, **and the world will be a better place with less suffering**
