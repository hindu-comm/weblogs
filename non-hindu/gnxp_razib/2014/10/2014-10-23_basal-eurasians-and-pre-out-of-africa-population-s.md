Basal Eurasians and pre-Out of Africa population structure

I don’t have time to comment in depth on the new [Siberian genome paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7523/full/nature13810.html). But I would like to mention that the text and the supplements both mention that **this individual lacks the “Basal Eurasian” component which seems ubiquitous in modern West Eurasians, and was likely brought by Middle Eastern farmers.** The Siberian genome seems to solidify the intuition that the non-Basal Eurasian Out of Africa populations diversified on the order of 50-60 thousand years ago. But another issue that comes to mind is that it looks like the Khosean of southern Africa might have diverged from other human groups \~200 thousand years ago. When considering the “mysterious” Basal Eurasians perhaps we should consider the possibility of a lot of population structure among anatomically modern humans within Africa. The ancestors of modern Eurasians may have been one of many African lineages, perhaps resident in a “Green Sahara” environment.
