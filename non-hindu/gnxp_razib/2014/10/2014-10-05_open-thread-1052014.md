[![9781408836200](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9781408836200-194x300.jpg?resize=194%2C300)![9781408836200](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9781408836200-194x300.jpg?resize=194%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20)In an earlier post I mentioned that I was excited to get [Xunzi: The Complete Text](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M//geneexpressio-20). But I won’t be reading it for a while, as right now I am in the midst of [Armand Leroi’s](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/10-questions-for-armand-m-leroi.php) [The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20). As might be predicted from [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031100/geneexpressio-20/), it’s beautifully written. Armand really has a way with prose, and he picks very engaging subject matters. As a biologist it’s no surprise that I’m a partisan of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) when it comes to the ancients, so the topic is certainly congenial. In any case, I already recommend [The Lagoon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20) to any readers who have some time and energy to put into a book. It’ll be worth it at the end, and the writing is such that you’ll enjoy the endeavor.

Second, I want to make a few notes about comments. As most of you know I moderate comments. Many of you I know, and pre-approve, and many of you I do not. Just a few common sense pointers

1\) Comments that begin with a gratuitous insult at me will probably not be published and you’ll be banned.

2\) Comments which attempt to lecture me on something I already know about will probably not be published. I’ve been blogging for 12 years now and have written a lot of things about a lot of topics. Just because I don’t address something you think you know about in a specific post doesn’t mean I haven’t addressed it in the past. People on the internet think they are very bright, I get that, but you have to prove it here.

3\) I’m good at recognizing elliptical comments which are trying to slip in something in a roundabout way. Just be direct, I don’t smile upon that sort of bashfulness.
