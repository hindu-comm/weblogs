You have the right to your genomic data (legally)

[Regulatory changes raise troubling questions for genomic testing](http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/gim2014127a.html):

> By 6 October 2014, many laboratories in the United States must begin > honoring new individual data access rights created by recent changes > to federal privacy and laboratory regulations. These access rights are > more expansive than has been widely understood and pose complex > challenges for genomic testing laboratories. This article analyzes > regulatory texts and guidances to explore which laboratories are > affected.

Well, I don’t know. Is it a “defect”? Might be pretty convenient.
