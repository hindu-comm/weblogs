ISIS’ willing executioners

On my Twitter some people seem awfully impressed by Ben, while others (including me) think that it’s a pretty good illustration of the shallowness of contemporary Left liberalism when it comes to religion. One response is that “you can’t generalize about 1.5 billion people.” No, I don’t mean Catholics, I mean Muslims. When it comes to Christianity, or white males, Left liberals seem comfortable generalizing about a pattern of patriarchy or oppression, no matter that some white Christian males were at the forefront of movements such as abolitionism. Words like “problematic” or “complex” and “nuanced” don’t come up whenpeople begin to hold forthupon the“white male Christian patriarchy.” It’s a vast monolith. Imagine if someone stated there was a problem with child sex abuse in the Catholic Church, and the response was that “you can’t generalize, most Catholic priests are not child abusers!” True. But enough are that it’s a problem. Affleck’s immediate response is that Maher and [![0226056767](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/0226056767.gif?resize=150%2C216)![0226056767](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/0226056767.gif?resize=150%2C216)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226056775/geneexpressio-20)Harris’ assertions were “Gross and Racist.” This emotive explosion is really at the heart of it, criticism of Islam triggered a disgust and aversion response, not a rational reaction. Not that we should expect Ben Affleck to engage in deep analysis, just as Maher and Harris are not deep thinkers on religion either. One strange thing I note about Ben Affleck’s angry reaction is that he challenged Maher and Harris on their lack of deep scholarly credentials in Islam. Now, if a Muslim had demanded this it would kind of make sense, but I don’t understand why a secular liberal would talk as if only the*ulema* could speak authoritatively about Islam. This is somewhat similar to the Yale Humanist association [objecting](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/09/16/an-open-letter-to-the-yale-muslims-and-humanists-who-opposed-ayaan-hirsi-alis-speech/) to Ayaan Hirsi Ali speaking about Islam, and demanding that someone with academic credentials be invited as well. Shall we impose the same criterion when it comes to Christianity? Only pastors and priests need apply?

First, this idea that there is a “moderate Islam” and a “fundamentalist Islam” is only useful to some extent. A genuinely textured argument needs to introduce more multitudes, from the philosphically esoteric Ismaili sect, which in its most numerous Nizari form tends toward what one might call a liberal form of modern Islam, to various traditionalist Sunnis who reject the Salafi/Deobani views but still express very conservative perspectives. The assassin of [Salman Tarseer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmaan_Taseer)was from the Barelvi[![download (1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/download-12-199x300.jpg?resize=199%2C300)![download (1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/download-12-199x300.jpg?resize=199%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674058194/geneexpressio-20) movement, which is the “moderate” traditionalist alternative to the various Salafi and Deobandi “conservative” currents which have been roiling Pakistan over the past few generations. I put the quotes because the Salafi and Deobandi movements are reformist, and to a great extent the products of the past few hundred years and strongly shaped by a modernist viewpoint, even if their*modus operandi*strikes us as reactionary. The fact is that traditional Islam has accepted as a majority consensus that apostasy from Islam should result in the death penalty. But there was also a lot of latitude in this area, and in pre-modern times political entities were not totalitarian. These sorts of edicts may not have been enforced much at all (analogy, Theodosius’ banning of public paganism in the late 4th century probably was not enforced across much of the Empire, though it did allow for interventions in some cases, such as the destruction of the [Serapeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapeum#Destruction_of_the_Alexandrian_Serapeum)). Additionally, the reality is that for particular classes and individuals there was a wide tolerancetoward free thought. The great physicianal-Razi clearly would be considered a [free thinker](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/09/16/an-open-letter-to-the-yale-muslims-and-humanists-who-opposed-ayaan-hirsi-alis-speech/), while the poet [al-Ma’arri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%CA%BFarri) was a caustic atheist (no surprise that ISIS beheaded one of his statues).

The modern age is arguably one of more conformity due to the ease of communication & travel, and the homogenizing power of the force of the state and mass media. In any case,*Wonkblog*assertions:

What they are doing when putting Islam front and center is pandering to public sentiment, which is becoming more and more conservative over the generations. And things don’t get more difficult whenbarbarism reflects the will of the people. When the people are tyrannical their will is irrelevant. That’s presumably why you have the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/). It is not surprising that the [Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Declaration_on_Human_Rights_in_Islam#Religious_features)endorsed by the Organization of the Islamic Conference did not vouchsafe that one could change religions. Second, **numbers are of the essence.** Western Muslims are important to Western people, because they live among us, but they are numerically trivial. *Wonkblog* provides the fraction of selected Muslim nations (or Muslims in selected nations) where proportions agree that apostates from Islam should be executed (which is truly the historical traditionalist view, even if there are details of implementation which make it difficult, and there are some dissenting views which are becoming louder). *Pew* also helpfully provides the number of Muslims in each nation estimated for 2010.

Much of the balance in terms of population is going to be in Africa and other Middle Eastern nations (e.g., Iran) and India. I don’t know how things will shake out, though Nigerian Muslims arenot particularly liberal, and I am curious if Indian Muslims would be any more liberal than Bangladeshi Muslims. In any case, we are faced with a glass half empty and half full situation. The majority of Muslims certainly do reject the death penalty for apostates today. But the minority who accept it as normative represent hundreds of millions of individuals. I tend to see the half empty aspect because I really don’t care what peaceful Muslims who focus on their mystical inner life do. They’re free to practice their superstition in the privacy of their homes, or in public spaces which they own, it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. The problem is that the **hundreds of millions who have what I might say are “problematic” viewpoints, if I was a pretentious liberal who enjoyed equivocating, would quite likely break my leg.** This is not an academic concern, I agree with Shadi Hamid that [democracy and liberalism](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/opinion/more-democratic-less-liberal.html) have not made their peace in much of the Arab world. To some extent the masses will always be suspicious of liberalism, because they are a dull and uncreative sort. The American populace supports banning flag burning, and often curtailment of various kinds of speech. Elites, whether on the Left or Right step in to block these sentiments through the courts. Elites in Muslim nations need to grow some balls in this area, though the pattern of assassination of those who speak against the barbarians in their midst from Tunisia to Pakistan illustrates how deadly serious these issues are.

Finally, [U.N. Report Details ISIS Abuse of Women and Children](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/world/middleeast/un-report-isis-abuse-women-children.html?_r=0):

> According to witnesses cited in the report, Islamic State fighters > dumped more than 60 Turkmen and Yazidi children in an orphanage in > Mosul after they had witnessed the killing of their parents by the > fighters. “It appears some of the older children may have been > physically and sexually assaulted,” the report notes. “Later, **ISIL > fighters returned to the orphanage and made the children pose with > ISIL flags so they could take photos of them.**”

In a barbaric pre-modern age the children would have been killed. So perhaps ISIS is not quite as 7th century as they like to proclaim. But the intersection of modernity, taking the photos, and barbarity on display here is reminiscent of Rwanda more than anything else. But this is more worrisome to me:

> The report said the Yazidi girl who was abducted by Islamic State > fighters when they attacked her village on Aug. 3 was raped several > times by different men before she was sold in a market. >
> “Women and girls are brought with price tags for the buyers to choose > and negotiate the sale,” the report said. **“The buyers were said to > be mostly youth from the local communities.** Apparently ISIL was > ‘selling’ these Yazidi women to the youth as a means of inducing them > to join their ranks.”

The barbaric behavior meted out to Shia and non-Muslims is generally not something they have to worry about themselves, and some have even collaborated for material gains. Though there are impositions on their personal freedom, from the perspective of a Sunni Arab the erstwhile Maliki regime and that of Assad’s may not have been better bets. **But no one forces you go to a slave market and buy slaves.** Civilization seems to rest lightly upon the shoulders of some. **That is gross.** You may not want to generalize about the religion of 1.5 billion, but if I was a Christian or Yezidi in the Fertile Crescent and I saw Sunni Arabs I know what I would do. Run. Don’t ask if they are moderate or fundamentalist. Just run.

**Addendum:** It is here that my friend [Omar Ali](https://twitter.com/omarali50) may ask if I am perhaps giving succor to the average Fox-News-watching imbecile. In other words, being frank and honest about the warts and all ofinternational Islam might cause problems for Western Muslims. I don’t have suggestions for my Middle Eastern friends, but for South Asians there’s an easy recourse: bow down before the idols of yourancestors. Arabs, Turks, and Persians think you’re black Hindus anyway, so why not go whole-hog? (so to speak) You’re just replacing a thousand little idols for one black stone you otherwise worship. A simple name change will suffice. Of course the idiots will think you’re Muslim anyway, but eat a ham sandwich and prove them wrong.
