Open Thread, 4/7/2014

Obviously been busy. Still comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan), but hard to free up time to write something substantive here. But this too shall pass. It always has.

I should mention I am almost done with [A Concise History of Russia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006WNSKCO/geneexpressio-20). Nothing revolutionary, but worthwhile as a refresher.
