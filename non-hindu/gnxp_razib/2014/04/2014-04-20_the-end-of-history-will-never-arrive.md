The End of History Will Never Arrive

The above clip of Neil DeGrasse Tyson has been lighting up my social feeds. It’s made [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com). Tyson ends by stating that **“Before we start talking about genetic differences \[between race and gender\], you gotta come up with a system where there is equal opportunity, then we can have that conversation.”** The major question that immediately comes to mind with these sorts of assertions, which are quite ubiquitous, is **how one determines the extent of equal opportunity if one does not have a model for the outcomes of equal opportunity.** The reality is that those making such claims have a model of the outcomes, unstated because it is shared by so many. Proportionate representation, because they assume that in fact that there are no innate dispositional differences\* between groups. The Left liberal version of *Homo economicus*.Once this model is in place then lack of proportionate representation can be taken as *ipso facto*evidence of lack of equal opportunity.\*\* With this model in hand innate dispositional differences would give the same outcomes, but could be taken as evidence of lack of equal opportunity. So ultimately the “lack of interest” in these issues dovetails nicely with [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability). If it turned out there were differences between the groups that the [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) would start to get messier.\*\*\*

Since the clips such as above are shared by like minded individuals naturally there’s no strong critique. Rather, the assertions are “devastating”to the opposing view, which are almost entirely absent among like-minded individuals. Larry Summers may be a moderately liberal Democrat, but his airing of possible differences between males and females in the early aughts is now grounds for reading him out of polite company from what I can tell. A few years ago I had dinner with [Chris Mooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mooney_(journalist)) about his contention that overall there is a [greater skepticism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003P9XDWK/geneexpressio-20) of science among Republicans/Right than Democrats/Left. I can accede to this point as being possible. It seems unlikely skepticism of science or religion or any other cultural trait would be equally distributed across the ideological spectrum, and in our day and age in the United States natural scientists tend to align with the political Left, and the political Right has a generalized distrust for intellectuals. But I pointed out to Chris that on the modern cultural Left acknowledgement of sex differences seems to still be in bad odor. But a moderate amount of [sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) seems to be evident in the natural history of our own species, so it isn’t unreasonable to posit *some* differences. But many now consider it an implausible prior. Chris was skeptical, as he contended that this battle had ended long ago, and a hardcore “blank slate” position has lost. I wish it were so. I had the experience of having an exchange with a prominent science writer with a background in science who would not concede that men, on average, have stronger upper bodies than women. When push comes to shove I doubt that this person would stand by such skepticism, but it illustrates how deep the reflex is if even basic size and strength differences are now subject to interrogation.

The normative roots of skepticism in this domain become clear when one focuses on the one area where Left and Right invert when it comes to the biological basis of human behavior: homosexuality. As a moderately heritable complex trait it seems entirely likely there is a biological basis for homosexuality, at least in part. **But the case has not been clinched by a “gay gene,” nor is the trait one which develops in a genetically deterministic fashion like the generation of five fingers on one’s hand.**For reasons common to many complex traits it seems unlikely that there will ever be found a singular “gay gene,” and evidence from fields such as psychology and neurobiology do not offer silver bullet models for how homosexuality comes about, because its expression has environmental correlates (for example, same-sex intercourse is practiced in a facultative manner in prison in the Arab world, without being homosexual orientation, so some nuance in terminology is necessary). But the cultural Left, and now the majority of young Americans, can grasp that a complex behavioral trait does not necessarily lend itself to explanatory models as simple as Newtonian physics. The threshold of skepticism of “innate differences” seems to curiously be lower in this case for the Left, and tuned up higher on the social Right.

[Motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning) is powerful. This will not be answered by one blog post, or a decades’ worth of research. Because complex traits have genetic architectures which are not easily reducible [to a few genes of large effect](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2014/02/06/genetics.113.159152.abstract), “final answers” may be a while in coming (if ever). **But the truth is what it is**. Even if people in the United States “lack interest” in particular subjects, that is unlikely to stop other nations, whose economies and scientific institutions are still developing, from exploring avenues of research neglected by Americans. Obviously there are no perfectly objective humans, but one convenient fact about ideological bias is that different groups have different blind spots. The future will likely be one of scientific cooperation as a side effect of competition.

Finally, it is always useful for me to outline some of my thoughts by referring to a piece by one of the greatest population geneticists of the 20th century, [James F. Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Crow). He writes in [Unequal by nature:  
a geneticist’s perspective on human differences](http://www.amacad.org/publications/winter2002/crow.pdf):

The basic model is exceedingly simple. Representation of the tails of a distribution can be much more skewed than small differences in mean values might imply. Let’s give a concrete illustration. Imagine a population at the mean of the height for American males. 70 inches or 5’10). Assuming a standard deviation of 2 inches and a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) 1 out of 770 males will be 76 inches or above (6’4 or greater).\*\*\*\* Now imagine a population where the average height for males is 71 inches. Obviously most of the distribution will overlap. But now 1 out of 161 males is 76 inches or above. For the two populations the overwhelming number of individuals are going to occupy the vast middle ground about the mean. **But for particular professions great height might be indispensable, in which case the two populations may have greatly different representations in such fields**.

I’m thinking in the above case American basketball. But it is key to remember that basketball requires more than great height. It requires grace and strength as well. In some domains, such as professional sports and the highest echelons of the academy, it seems likely that individuals will exhibit a combination of exceptional traits, not just one, in which case the above argument is further amplified.

None of this is difficult to understand, even if you reject any empirical basis in specific cases. But 10 years of discussing this topic has informed me that this is irrelevant, when people are highly motivated they will refuse to engage in what Ernst Mayr terms [“population thinking”](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/species.html). Rather, they will insist on referring to typologies, rather than distributions, even if one asserts that one is discussing distributions. For one, this is comfortable as a mode of analysis for humans. Categories are clear and distinct. Second, it makes for much easier refutation of plainly incorrect categorical assertions. But despite futility some things must be said now and again.

**Addendum:** There are some asking how one can disentangle environmental and genetic effects. That is a large part of what fields like behavior genetics, and now much of social science, attempt to do. But that being said I have outlined a very simple [design enabled by modern genomics](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-edges-of-the-genotype-phenotype-map/), leveraging the imperfect correlation between genomic ancestry and physical appearance.

\* These need not be heritable or genetic. So I’m being vague with the terminology.

\*\* A second implicit assumption is a normative understanding of how humans flourish and the set of choices which they should make to self-actualize.

\*\*\* It isn’t logically impossible to contend that there are differences between populations/sexes which make proportional representation unlikely, and, that there are social impediments which might amplify or dampen skewed representation in particular fields. The former cases seem self-evident, but what would I put in the latter categories? Clearly throughout the 20th century the representation of Jews, and later Asians in the United States, in areas of higher education have been dampened by quota systems. Similarly, segregation in sports resulted in an over-representation of non-Hispanic whites in many fields in the United States. Once equality of opportunity was allowed (or in cases where it has been) one saw not a decrease, but increase, is representation in the elite levels away from population wide proportions.

\*\*\*\* In reality many quantitative traits exhibit “fat tails,” so there are more individuals at the extremes than one might expect. But that doesn’t alter the qualitative effect.
