Lee Berger, paleoanthropology’s Robespierre

[![330px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/330px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis.jpg?resize=330%2C421)![330px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/330px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis.jpg?resize=330%2C421)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/330px-Homo_sapiens_neanderthalensis.jpg)Sometimes context is important when processing new information. Something huge is afoot in paleoanthropology, traditionally the study of ancient humanity predicated on analyzing morphological remains. Fossils. Though a fascinating discipline, unfortunately there’s always been an issue of supply and demand. There isn’t much supply of fossils, and there’s a lot of demand to analyze them. This means that monopoly power comes into play, as who has the fossils matters a great deal, not necessarily who has the great ideas. Some researchers have been known to sit on remains for *decades*. Access to particular field sites is also a precious commodity, and doled out to favorites and allies. Contrast this with the situation in modern genomics, as the swell of data is overwhelming the ability of researchers to analyze it (at least analyze it well!). Of course all of science is a human endeavor, and as such is subject to the whims of political and personal machination. But when the potential fame and glory is enormous, but resources few and far between, as is the case in paleoanthropology, the behind the scenes trench warfare can become quite brutal.

This is why what [Lee Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Berger) is doing is such a big deal. Last fall he quickly assembled a team funded by*National Geographic* to retrieve samples from an exceedingly rich site he happened to stumble upon. Dubbed the [Rising Star Expedition](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/) the dig yielded \~1,200 remains, many of very high quality. Let that sink in. In a field where a few partial remains can reshape our whole understanding of the past, **Berger is sitting on a sample size of over 1,000, many of quite high quality**. But he’s not hoarding his find. Rather, he’s aiming to change the terms of how the game is played, and inviting researchers from all over the world to join him in a workshop to collaboratively analyze the results. Here’s the details of what’s going down from [National Geographic](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/17/call-for-scientists-to-join-rising-star-workshop-2014/):

So far it looks as if the information coming out is focusing on the raw numbers of fossils. This alone going to revolutionize the field. Berger is already an eminent paleoanthropologist, but by this act he has induced a professional inflection point. Things will never be the same. **But it is also the case that the scientific yield is going to change the way in which we view the origin and evolution of hominins.** I guarantee that. Some of the facts to come are going to blow your mind (and no, I don’t have an inspirational video to go along with that assertion).
