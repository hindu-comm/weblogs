European hunter-gatherers, blue eyes and dark skin?

[Derived immune and ancestral pigmentation alleles in a 7,000-year-old Mesolithic European](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12960.html):

Moreover, we provide evidence that a significant number of derived, putatively adaptive variants associated with pathogen resistance in modern Europeans were already present in this hunter-gatherer.

The headlines about this individual having dark skin are well founded, like the [Luxembourg](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/phenotypic-whiteness-as-an-outcome-of-neolithic-admixture/) hunter-gatherer the sample has ancestral “non-European” copies of most of the major loci which are known to have large effect sizes (*SLC24A5*, which is now fixed in Europeans, *SLC45A2*, which is present at frequencies north of 80% in most of Europe, and *KITLG*, a lower frequency variant known to have a major impact on skin and hair). Additionally, this individual is related to the Ma’lta individual, just like the Swedish hunter-gatherers, but unlike the Luxembourg male (which did predate the Spanish samples by 1,000 years). Lots of functional stuff is in this paper too. Seems like immune adaptations aren’t just a function of agriculture.

One thing I want to note is that I’m not sure how much of the shift toward Finns of the Swedish and Spanish hunter-gatherers is due to Paleolithic European ancestry, vs. admixture with “eastern” elements. Since the Finns seem to have more recent East Asian ancestry excess paleo-Siberian in the Mesolithic samples may shift them in the same direction. The eastward since of the La Brana individuals is really obvious in the world wide PCA, they are farther toward East Asians than any other modern Europeans.
