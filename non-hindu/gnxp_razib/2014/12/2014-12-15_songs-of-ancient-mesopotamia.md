Songs of Ancient Mesopotamia

I guess this is taking “world music” to the next level, going back to the ancient Mesopotamians. The artist is [Stef Conner](http://www.stefconner.com/), and you can read about how this reconstruction was done over at [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/what-did-ancient-mesopotamian-hits-sound-something-291543), where there is a Soundcloud preview of her full album, *The Flood*. I’d actually purchase it if I could find a full digital copy, but I don’t see any out there right now (the article says it will be on iTunes next month). You can buy a [physical copy](http://www.stefconner.com/) at her website, but the last time I purchased a C.D. was probably in the early 2000s, so that’s not happening. Anyway, do listen the [preview](https://soundcloud.com/stefconner/the-flood-preview) on Soundcloud. The drinking song above is probably not representative.
