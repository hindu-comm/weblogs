Though there is a focus on the *social* aspect, this is really a book on evolutionary modeling more generally. And, it’s less daunting than many other works that I’ve run into. The authors also make a nice case for why analytical modeling is still important in an age of simulations.

Been very busy with stuff, trying to get as much work done as possible before Christmas. You know how it is.
