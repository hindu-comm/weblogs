Cultural evolution exists

[![9780226520438](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/9780226520438-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)![9780226520438](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/9780226520438-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226520447/geneexpressio-20)A very fertile area of evolutionary science is the understanding and modeling of human culture. But it’s hard, which is why my aspiration is to be an evolutionary geneticist in a more classical sense. Not only is it hard, but people don’t appreciate it, **because they think they understand “culture.”** Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson’s [The Origin and Evolution of Cultures](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019518145X/geneexpressio-20) is an excellent introduction (with [Not by Genes Alone](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0037Z7LCU/geneexpressio-20) for a more popular audience), but Alex Mesoudi’s [Cultural Evolution: How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226520447/geneexpressio-20) is a more recent survey which I think is very worthwhile. [![0226712842](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/0226712842.gif?resize=150%2C225)![0226712842](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/0226712842.gif?resize=150%2C225)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0037Z7LCU/geneexpressio-20)Complementary to the modelers, who draw from classical genetic frameworks (going back to [Cultural Transmission and Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691082839/geneexpressio-20) by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman), are the cognitive anthropologists, represented by Dan Sperber and his colleagues ([Explaining Culture: A Naturalistic Approach](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//0631200452/geneexpressio-20)). Another way to look at this is that it is **cultural anthropology without the Post-Modern Voodoo.** In other words, it strives for disciplinary relevance through a fidelity to reality, rather than political and social impact.

This is all to highly recommend you read an excellent post on cultural evolution, [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](http://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/). I don’t link to blogs much because it is usually more useful to read the paper, or the book, but in this case I think the writer really reduced the essentials of the field down to a manageable extent. Hopefully it will encourage readers to pursue their own avenues of inquiry.
