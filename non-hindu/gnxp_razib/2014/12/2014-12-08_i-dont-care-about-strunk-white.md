I don’t care about Strunk & White

[![sense_of_style_book_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sense_of_style_book_cover.jpg?resize=150%2C225)![sense_of_style_book_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sense_of_style_book_cover.jpg?resize=150%2C225)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIYG74/geneexpressio-20)Making my way through Steve Pinker’s [The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670025852/geneexpressio-20), one thing I really appreciate is his lucid deconstruction and refutation of the tyranny of [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0205632645/geneexpressio-20), also known as [“Strunk & White”](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0205632645/geneexpressio-20). It’s not that I haven’t run into this line of thinking before from [linguists](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1485). But it’s interesting to note that Pinker points out that **Strunk & White violate the very maxims they promote in a sentence asserting the importance of particular grammatical constructions** (e.g., using passive voice to exhort active voice). From what I can gather part of the issue is that the authors themselves were not linguistic scholars, so lacked the expertise to pass judgments on issues which they were only vaguely aware of. Nevertheless, they’ve attained a certain oracular status among many Americans. I know this because over the years of my blogging many readers have exhorted me to read Strunk & White to remedy my deficiencies as a prose stylist. At some point in the mid-2000s I tried, but found it all rather tedious. This makes sense, as I always detested the grammar section of English class. My teachers were sometimes perplexed, because I obviously read and wrote with a high aptitude.

  
Here’s a recent comment that I trashed:

The comment is a little on the patronizing side, but it’s pretty typical. Perhaps \~10 years ago I’d have taken this sort of advice in stride, but at this point [I think I’m doing OK](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/opinion/our-cats-ourselves.html). These comments are invariably from anonymous people leaving remarks on the internet.
