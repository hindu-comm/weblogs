Population genomics’ end

Nice review, [Advances and limits of using population genetics to understand local adaptation](https://peerj.com/preprints/488v1.pdf). In particular the focus here is on the insights one can derive from new genomic methods (e.g., think of [SFS](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23770700) analysis). But they on a cautious, perhaps even down, note:

> Many of the important questions in local adaptation being pursued with > population genetics approaches begin – rather than end – with > identifying loci responsible for variation. It is therefore important > to realize that a full accounting of local adaptation at the molecular > level goes beyond having high-quality data to analyze and statistical > methods to identify causative genes. The crux of the challenge is that > most ecologically important traits responsible for local adaptation > are quantitative, **and identifying all of the genes responsible for > variation in quantitative traits is likely not possible.** Even the > cumulative explanatory power of individual loci identified in human genotype–phenotype association studies, which often involve tens of thousands of individuals, is generally only a small percentage of the phenotypic variation….

But I want to note that they cite a paper from [2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22243964), and the work in capturing the fraction of phenotypic variation from genomic variation for height has [gotten much better since then](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n11/abs/ng.3097.html). So perhaps in that way that is a reason for optimism. Though, as they note, humans are a best case scenario since the sample sizes are enormous. Just a nice reminder of the limitations of the ‘post-genomic’ era.
