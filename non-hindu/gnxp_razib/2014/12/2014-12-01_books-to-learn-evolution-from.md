Books to learn evolution from (?)

[![41f91FCrhhL](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/41f91FCrhhL-186x300.jpg?resize=186%2C300)![41f91FCrhhL](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/41f91FCrhhL-186x300.jpg?resize=186%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002JF1N0A/geneexpressio-20)Very often I get a question of the form “what book should I read to understand evolution?” This is a somewhat awkward issue for me. Unlike with population genetics the only textbook I’ve read to understanding evolution is Doug Futuyma’s originally titled [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605351156/geneexpressio-20). Of course [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002JF1N0A/geneexpressio-20) is an easy suggestion. But beyond that I’m not quite sure. I know some people think that Stephen Jay Gould’s [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006135/geneexpressio-20) is an important work, but I’m of the camp that it is really just a somewhat prolix reduction of only Gould’s very idiosyncraticthoughts. A major problem with this whole question is that “evolution” encompasses many distinct fields, from natural history all the way to population genetics (the old Neo-Darwinian Synthesis has been modified and appended by new fields such as evolutionary ecology). I know my way around pop gen, but really am at a loss (unfortunately) as to the scientific literature in natural history and macroevolutionary processes.[![download](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/download-191x300.jpg?resize=191%2C300)![download](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/download-191x300.jpg?resize=191%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20) Though I do think Mark Ridley’s reader, [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199267944/geneexpressio-20), is quite good (I don’t know about the textbook of the same name by Ridley because I haven’t read it). Ernst Mayr’s [What Evolution Is](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465044263/geneexpressio-20)ismore like a very soft primer for those with weak science backgrounds, rather than a nuts & bolts treatment. Richard Dawkins’ [scientific works](https://www.amazon.com/Richard-Dawkins/e/B000AQ3RBI/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1417410937&sr=1-1) have the same problem as Gould’s, they give a very personal perspective of evolutionary theory (though I like them quite a bit more because Dawkins is less an outlier than Gould was).

Reader comments/suggestions welcome here. For *genetics* though I can make an informed comment. If you want keep it manageable, then it’s [John Maynard Smith’s](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20) dense but compact textbook. If you are ambitious, [Charlesworth & Charlesworth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20). Also, I know it’s a bit “old” now, but Joe Felsenstein’s [Inferring Phylogenies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878931775/geneexpressio-20) is great (this another case where the author has his own particular perspective, but he’s a very eminent scientist respected by all, so that’s OK).
