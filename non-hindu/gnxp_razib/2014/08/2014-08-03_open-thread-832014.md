Open Thread, 8/3/2014

Posting will be light in August. I probably won’t get to [Nick Bostrom’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom) [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00LOOCGB2/geneexpressio-20), but I wish I could. I often don’t agree with people who take transhumanism and its assorted topics seriously, but generally I find engaging them extremely though provoking. Usually people use “thought provoking” as a throwaway line, but I mean it literally.
