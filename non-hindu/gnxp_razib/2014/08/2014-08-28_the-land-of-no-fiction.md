The land of no fiction

[![the-clan-of-the-cave-bear](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-clan-of-the-cave-bear-180x300.jpg?resize=180%2C300)![the-clan-of-the-cave-bear](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-clan-of-the-cave-bear-180x300.jpg?resize=180%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00466HQ2Y/geneexpressio-20)On Facebook [Nathan Pearson](https://twitter.com/GenomeNathan) challenged me to name 10 books that have stuck with me. Many of you have probably been tagged on this challenge. For what it’s worth, here’s the list:

[Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)\* (Hartl & Clark)  
[From Dawn to Decadence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060928832/geneexpressio-20)\* (Jacques Barzun)  
[The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958332/geneexpressio-20)\* (Steven Pinker)  
[History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20)\* (L. L. Cavalli-Sforza)  
[Prelude to Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20)\* (Isaac Asimov)  
[In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20) (Scott Atran)  
[The First Man in Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KFDKSKO/geneexpressio-20) (Colleen McCullough)  
[Genome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AXXUA7C/geneexpressio-20) (Matt Ridley)  
[The Rise of Western Christendom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631221387/geneexpressio-20) (Peter Brown)  
[The Bible with Sources Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006073065X/geneexpressio-20) (Richard Elliott Friedman)

The challenge stipulated that you not think too long, and I came up with the list in less than two minutes. But the first five, which I’ve placed asterisks next to, came to mind within 10 seconds. **I’m rather sure that these fivewould be on any list of 10 books of note from my own perspective**. [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20)and [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)probably explain to some extent why I’m where I am professionally.[From Dawn to Decadence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060928832/geneexpressio-20)is a testament to the continuity of the life of mind of a sort which I aspire to attain (though I doubt I will). Steven Pinker’s [The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958332/geneexpressio-20)opened up for me a window to a world where disciplinary boundaries are violated for both fun and profit.The lastfive took me longer because there are [many books](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18982209-razib-khan) which have stuck with me with at the next tier of salience. These might change from instance to instance, though the set isn’t that large.

[![Prelude_to_Foundation_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Prelude_to_Foundation_cover-198x300.jpg?resize=198%2C300)![Prelude_to_Foundation_cover](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Prelude_to_Foundation_cover-198x300.jpg?resize=198%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20)Which brings me to [Prelude to Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20). Why is it in the top five? It’s not even the best of the [Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(novel)) novels (I would probably go with [Foundation and Empire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FC1PWK/geneexpressio-20) for that). As Nathan pointed out **my list leaned toward non-fiction.** [Prelude to Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20) is on this list **because it is the first *fiction* book I proactively selected at the library at the age of 13.** The main reason I picked it is because I’d read some of the author’s non-fiction works for children when I was younger, and was curious that he’d written science fiction (only later did I find out that he was originally known as a science fiction author). But I have to be specific here. After responding to Nathan I realized that I’d read two works of fiction before [Prelude to Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20), [Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004PYDBKI/geneexpressio-20), when I was 12, and [Clan of the Cave Bear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00466HQ2Y/geneexpressio-20), when I was 9. My reading [Clan of the Cave Bear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00466HQ2Y/geneexpressio-20) was something of a mistake. I was sleeping over at a friend’s house, and he had a copy of the book, which I mistook for a work of paleontology. I began reading it sometime around 9-10 PM, and kept going until the sun came up, when Iwas done. [Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004PYDBKI/geneexpressio-20) I read over an extremely boring Christmas vacation where my parents visited old friends for a week, and I forgot to bring any books and had to find something to read in the house we were staying at.

This is autobiographical trivia, but I thought I’d submit it into the record because as you can tell by the precision of my recollections **I had very little interest in fiction when I was younger.** To some extent this remains true, when I have little marginal time I continue to read non-fiction and basically cut out fiction totally. From interacting with people as I grew older I began to realize this was a little strange. I wonder how many other children are the same as me? I’m also curious how my children will turn out.

**Addendum**: To be clear, I was a huge reader of non-fiction from about the age of 7 onward.
