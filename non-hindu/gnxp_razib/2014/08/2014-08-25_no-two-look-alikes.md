No two look-alikes

*The New York Times* summarizes some new research in behavior and personality, [Holding a Mirror to Their Natures: Looking at Twin Personality Through Look-alikes](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/science/looking-at-twin-personality-through-look-alikes.html):

> As she expected, the unrelated look-alikes showed little similarity in > either personality or self-esteem. By contrast, twins — especially identical twins — score similarly on both scales, suggesting that the likeness is largely because of genetics. Her results were published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. >
> For a second study, she teamed with a skeptic, Ulrich Ettinger, a psychologist at the University of Bonn in Germany who had heard about the look-alike project during a postdoctorate at the University of Montreal. >
> “I thought that if two people looked alike, they would have similar personality traits because people would treat them the same,” he said. “For example, I thought men who looked alike and were tall and handsome would probably be extroverts.” >
> Their analysis was consistent with the findings of Dr. Segal’s first study: Personality traits do not appear to be influenced by the way people are treated because of appearance. Moreover, they found, there appears to be no special bond between look-alikes.

Graham, and Ulrich Ettinger. “Unrelated look-alikes: Replicated study of personality similarity and qualitative findings on social relatedness.” Personality and Individual Differences 55.2 (2013): 169-174.](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/twins-300x213.png?resize=300%2C213)

The original study, [Unrelated look-alikes: Replicated study of personality similarity and qualitative findings on social relatedness](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913001062), is quite modest in scope. You can see the sample sizes are not large in the table to the left. With that said, **I think this is adding to a growing body of resultsthat validate the soundness of the original work on twins in behavior genetics.** For many reasons this research program has come under sharp critiques over the past 50 years, but it seems to me that the big picture findings[![NoTwoAlike](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NoTwoAlike.jpg?resize=164%2C240)![NoTwoAlike](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NoTwoAlike.jpg?resize=164%2C240)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393329712//geneexpressio-20) ofmodest heritabilities for mostbehavioral phenotypes is holding up. For a complementary tack I suggest [Whole genome approaches to quantitative genetics](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10709-008-9301-7#page-1), which uses different methods to explore some of the same class of  
traits. Relying on the body of twin research alone as a foundation might be a shaky basis for conjecture, but now this area is going multi-disciplinary,  
allowing for a stool with multiple legs. Of course all it is doing is confirming **modest** heritabilities forbehavioral phenotypes. But one needs to remember that alot of the environmental component is not amenable to control, whether by parents or society (i.e., it is “non-shared environment”).

God does play dice.
