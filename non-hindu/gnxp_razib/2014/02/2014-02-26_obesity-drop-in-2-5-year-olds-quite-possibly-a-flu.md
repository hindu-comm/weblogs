Obesity drop in 2-5 year olds quite possibly a fluke

Yesterday I tweeted out [Obesity Rate for Young Children Plummets 43% in a
Decade](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/health/obesity-rate-for-young-children-plummets-43-in-a-decade.html). This is a big deal, and many people retweeted it. Here’s the summary in *The New York Times*:

> But the figures on Tuesday showed a sharp fall in obesity rates among > all 2- to 5-year-olds, offering the first clear evidence that > America’s youngest children have turned a corner in the obesity > epidemic. About 8 percent of 2- to 5-year-olds were obese in 2012, > down from 14 percent in 2004.

They helpfully link to the [paper](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1832542) in *The Journal of the American Medical Association*, [Prevalence of Childhood and Adult Obesity in the United States, 2011-2012](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1832542). **And actually, if you read the paper the authors themselves seem very unsure about the robustness of this specific result.** I quote from the paper:

The p-value here is 0.03 for the difference in question. That passes the conventional threshold of significance (0.05), but it is close enough to the border that I’m quite suspicious. Here is the full conclusion of the paper:

> Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence > in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence > remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.

Granted, these may turn out to be real true results. And the age class that showed a decline in obesity is definitely one we should focus on. But public health is a serious matter, and therefore we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves.

One hypothesis that presents itself in regards to this paper is that a reviewer asked explicitly about the [multiple comparisons problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem). The authors acknowledged the problem, without actually checking to see if the results hold after a correction, and then the editor let the paper through. Of course this is just a model. I haven’t tested it, so can’t even offer up a p-value, even if I was a [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference).
