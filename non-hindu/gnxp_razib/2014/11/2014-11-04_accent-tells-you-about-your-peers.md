Accent tells you about your peers

[![tnapb4](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tnapb4.jpg?resize=165%2C250)![tnapb4](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tnapb4.jpg?resize=165%2C250)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20)Judith Rich Harris’ [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20) is one of those books which I’ve been leaning on for over a decade, it’s so rich in novel and “counter-intuitive” facts which nevertheless just “make sense” in terms of *how the world is* as opposed to *how we’re taught the world should be*. The most important finding isn’t really about the importance of heritable variation in human behavior, though that’s not trivial, **it’s that “shared \[family\] environment” matters so much less than you’d think.** Quite a large fraction of the variation in outcomes is “non-shared environment,” which basically means we just don’t know, and so we can’t really control. In [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20) it is posited that a large fraction of “non-shared environment” are peer group effects. One of the facts which the author uses to support this model is that **the vast majority of people pick up their accents in their native language from their peers, not their parents.** The telling is exception are children who are diagnosed as autistic. But I don’t know this literature in psychology well and so I’ve been repeating this fact for years without knowing the primary source. Now I think I’ve found it, [Do children with autism acquire the phonology of their peers? An examination of group identification through the window of bilingualism](http://fla.sagepub.com/content/14/42-43/241.short):

The sample size was less than 100, and I’m very curious if this research has been followed up (using Google Scholar I didn’t stumble on anything very clear, but again, I’m not familiar with this discipline). My point in focusing on accent in the [previous post](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/no-longer-my-america/) is *how we speak* is often a social cue, rather than about language acquisition as such. Speaking of which, though it is common sense it is important to reiterate that [children are basically savants](http://nautil.us/blog/we-all-used-to-be-geniuses) when it comes to learning languages. Multi-lingualism is common in many parts of the developing world, and presumably it may have been in a more ethnically fragmented ancient world too. It’s a core human competency, not a signal of cognitive exceptionality.
