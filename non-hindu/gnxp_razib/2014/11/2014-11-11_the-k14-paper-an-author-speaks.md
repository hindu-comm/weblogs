The K14 paper, an author speaks

In the [post below](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/a-man-30000-years-before-his-time/#comment-769455) Martin Sikora, an author on the K14 ancient DNA paper, has responded. The whole thing is worth reading:

Some of the reactions to our paper have caught me a little by surprise, but in retrospect it probably reflects the complexity of the story, which is something I also struggled with (and still am!). >

In your post you also seem to imply > that, i.e we don’t “*acknowledge the possibility that K14 did not > leave modern descendants, and was part of an early population which > did not end up flourishing*”. I actually agree with the early > population part, and we also acknowledge that in our suggested model > in Figure 2, which does not have a K14-related population directly > contributing to modern Europeans. What one can say with reasonable > certainty though is that K14 does share substantial amount of ancestry > with Mesolithic Hunter-gatherers (and therefore modern Europeans by > extension), but at the same time appears less close to East Asians > than all Western Eurasians, so things are complex.

K14 is after all \~36,000 years closer to the East Asia / West > Eurasia split, so it lacks a substantial amount of drift on the > European branch.

The same is obviously true for the “Middle East” component, but it still implies that K14 somehow relates ancestrally to those populations whereas all other HGs including MA1 do not. >

Personally I would expect ancient samples from the Caucasus or Central Asia to yet again spring some surprises. The cool thing is that we’ll probably know soon, since many groups are adding more and more samples to the picture. >
> Anyways, I just wanted to share my thoughts, hope this clears up things a bit. >
> Btw regrading your subsequent ANE post, I can confirm that those are the Kalash. Interesting also that the correspondingly the Kalash ADMIXTURE component shows up in MA1, but is almost absent in K14 (see our Figure S20). >
