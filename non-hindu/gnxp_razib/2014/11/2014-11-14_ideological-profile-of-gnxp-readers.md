Ideological profile of GNXP readers

Below I’ve take the survey results and plotted the scatter of results along two dimensions, and smoothed them out. No surprises, readers are about equally divided between libertarians, liberals, and conservatives, with a bias of numbers in that order. There are very few “populists,” understood to be people with Left economic views and Right social views. The good majority of readers are anti-interventionist, but there’s a small minority that is internationalist. There are very few “liberal internationalist” types among my readers. Rather, the tendency for this to correlate with economic, and to a lesser extent social, conservatism suggests these are probably non-libertarian conservatives in the readership.

**Note:** The charts’ titles have “conservatism” and “interventionism” in them because higher values on the x or y axis indicates higher values in this direction.
