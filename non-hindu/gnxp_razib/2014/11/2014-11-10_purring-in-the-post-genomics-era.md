Purring in the post-genomic era

[![birman](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/birman.png?resize=300%2C264)![birman](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/birman.png?resize=300%2C264)](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/05/1410083111.abstract)I am an author on this paper, [Comparative analysis of the domestic cat genome reveals genetic signatures underlying feline biology and domestication](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/05/1410083111.abstract):

> We present highlights of the first complete domestic cat reference > genome, to our knowledge. We provide evolutionary assessments of the > feline protein-coding genome, population genetic discoveries > surrounding domestication, and a resource of domestic cat genetic > variants. These analyses span broadly, from carnivore adaptations for > hunting behavior to comparative odorant and chemical detection > abilities between cats and dogs. We describe how segregating genetic > variation in pigmentation phenotypes has reached fixation within a > single breed, and also highlight the genomic differences between > domestic cats and wildcats. Specifically, the signatures of selection > in the domestic cat genome are linked to genes associated with gene knockout models affecting memory, fear-conditioning behavior, and stimulus-reward learning, and potentially point to the processes by which cats became domesticated.

Iâ€™ll have more to say, but here is a write up in [Science](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/11/genes-turned-wildcats-kitty-cats). Super happy be part of the team that got this published, especially Mike Montague, who did the heavy lifting.
