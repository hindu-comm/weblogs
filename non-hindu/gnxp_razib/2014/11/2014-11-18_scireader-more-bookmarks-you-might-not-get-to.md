SciReader, more bookmarks you might not get to….

[![scireader](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scireader-300x73.png?resize=300%2C73)![scireader](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scireader-300x73.png?resize=300%2C73)](http://www.scireader.org/)The [Pritchard Lab](http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/home.html) at Stanford is beta testing a new tool to help you sort through the tsunami of publications coming at you, [SciReader](http://scireader.org/). Registration is easy enough, and I just imported my library from [PubChase](http://www.pubchase.com/), which does something very similar. Right now the recommendations from [SciReader](http://scireader.org/) aren’t really relevant, despite the fact that I’ve put in topics, authors, and a rather large PubChase library. So I assume it’s waiting me to “like” more papers. Fair enough. (or there might be a latency in relation to how soon the engine responds)

[![pub](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pub.png?resize=180%2C48)![pub](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pub.png?resize=180%2C48)](http://www.pubchase.com/)But one thing that has come to mind is what I use these tools for. If you look at who I [follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/following) it generally does not go above 300 (I prune inactive/dormant accounts as I add people), and the list is heavily skewed toward those with a disciplinary focus similar to mine (evolutionary genomics, broadly). I’ve noticed that **PubChase is usually a day to a week behind Twitter in pointing me to papers of specific interest to me.**\* So why are these tools even useful? First, it’s a good way to have a personal library that one can use for references. But second, it also points me to papers which are of interest, but somewhat just outside of my core domain of focus. Basically they make sure I don’t get too snug on my optimum adaptive peak, and ignore goings on outside the ghetto.

**Update:** Jonathan Pritchard leaves a comment, which I think is very clarifying as to why a prominent research lab is developing a tool which seems more up the alley of the private sector:

\* Google Scholar now as a recommendation service, and though it’s less frequent in telling me to notice a new paper, they tend to be *very* laser targeted.
