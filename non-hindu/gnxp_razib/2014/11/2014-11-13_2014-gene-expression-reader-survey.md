2014 Gene Expression reader survey

![IMG_20141111_213014407](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_20141111_213014407-e1415867713356.jpg?resize=200%2C268)![IMG_20141111_213014407](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_20141111_213014407-e1415867713356.jpg?resize=200%2C268)Over the years I’ve realizedthat since I regularly verbally bludgeon readers people think I’m a severe and overly serious person. Apparently the headshotwhich I have on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan) also seems a bit dickish (it was taken in Florence in 2010). To compensate for that I had a friend take this picture of me recently. I’m smiling. So I’m capable of that.

Second, it’s been a while since I posted a reader survey. I’ve been doing them every few years since 2005. I expect that since I moved to *Unz Review* there has been some change in the readership, but I also have the same people who have been following me across platforms (speaking of this issue, just [subscribe to my total content feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed)).

Here is this the link for this year’s survey, <http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1890211/Gene-Reader-Survey>. There are 33 questions. Many of them pretty quick (e.g., age, sex, number of children). I’ll be posting an update, and the raw data (csv format) later.

Finally, [old reader survey posts](http://www.unz.com/?s=+&searchsubmit=Search&title=%22Reader+survey%22&authors=razib-khan&ptype=gnxp&commentsearch=exclude).

**Update:** Nearly 300 responses in. Past experience tells me that the numbers won’t go much more than 500, and that will take a long time. I’ve put the results so far in [csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhwa5stugkd3s5p/genesurvey.csv?dl=0) and [excel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iedzq0ujc4jo672/genesurvey.xls?dl=0) format. I’ll keep the file name the same as I generate updated reports. No big surprises so far, as the respondents pretty much fit the profile of earlier results. Only major surprises to me are the high support levels for maintaining blue collar wages through government intervention, and, the overwhelming acceptance (\~75%) of anthropogenic climate change given the somewhat libertarian bias of the readers.
