[![9780191574061_p0_v2_s260x420](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9780191574061_p0_v2_s260x420-102x150.jpg?resize=102%2C150)![9780191574061_p0_v2_s260x420](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9780191574061_p0_v2_s260x420-102x150.jpg?resize=102%2C150)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SEHIG2/geneexpressio-20)I’ve updated the raw data ([csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhwa5stugkd3s5p/genesurvey.csv?dl=0), [Excel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iedzq0ujc4jo672/genesurvey.xls?dl=0)) for the survey, which has nearly 340 respondents now. You can see the [results so far here](https://app.surveygizmo.com/reportsview/?key=322299-3781210-239332d002265efbda0457ccb672c5ca&print=true). Interestingly, 75 percent of readers claim to have read [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192860925/geneexpressio-20), vs. 65 percent who’ve read [The Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451529065/geneexpressio-20). More have read [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) than [Molecular Biology of the Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C1826MY/geneexpressio-20) or [Molecular Biology of the Cell](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0089NVFRM/geneexpressio-20). Not surprising. What is surprising is the reader who claims to have read me for 20 years! I assume that this individual means 2 years. Most of the results align with what has always been the case since the beginning of the blog. Mostly male. Mostly atheist. Mostly white. Politically diverse. Socioeconomically skewed toward the higher income and more well-educated (\~15% of readers*do not*have a university degree).
