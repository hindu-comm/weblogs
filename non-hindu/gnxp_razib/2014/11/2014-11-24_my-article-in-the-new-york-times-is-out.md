My article in The New York Times is out

It’s about domestication, with a focus on the results from the recent [PNAS paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/05/1410083111.abstract). [Our Cats, Ourselves](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/opinion/our-cats-ourselves.html?):

> It’s commonplace to call our cats “pets.” But anyone sharing a cat’s household can tell you that, much as we might like to choose when they eat in the morning, or when they come inside for the night, cats are only partly domesticated. >
> The likely ancestors of the domestic dog date from more than 30,000 > years ago. But domestic cats’ forebears join us in the skeletal record only about 9,500 years ago. This difference fits our intuition about their comparative degrees of domestication: Dogs want to be “man’s best friend”; cats, not so much.
