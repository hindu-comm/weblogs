Different ways to color a cat

Early last year an ancient genomics paper came out with the title [Derived immune and ancestral pigmentation alleles in a 7,000-year-old Mesolithic European](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v507/n7491/full/nature12960.html). The point here is that light pigmentation associated alleles common in Europeans seem to be relatively new derived mutations from the ancestral state, associated with Africans. An Ewen Callaway [write up](http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-european-genomes-reveal-jumbled-ancestry-1.14456) highlighted the fact that one of the inferences made from these genomes is that these hunter-gatherers had light eyes (blue) and dark(er) skin. At the time I pointed out to Callaway on Twitter that we need to be careful here, as ancient Europeans may have had different variants, and these traits are not monogenic but exhibit dependencies on multiple loci. In light of my [post below](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/prehistoric-europeans-did-not-look-like-ayla/) [Graham Coop](https://twitter.com/Graham_Coop/status/531851695362293760) suggested a similar issue, that there could have been convergence. In other words, just because modern Europeans have particular derived alleles which confer a particular trait, it does not entail that ancient peoples who lived in Europe had to have the same alleles to confer the same phenotype. [Alicia Martin](https://twitter.com/genetisaur/status/531860949972430849) observed that OCA2 is a locus where fast evolution occurred in both East Asians and West Eurasians (especially Europeans), but at different SNPs. In other words, the same gene is modified, but the mutational event is distinct.

Pigmentation in humans seems to be a trait we have a pretty good grasp of. Because most of the genetic variation between populations seems to be localized at relatively large effect loci GWAS has been good at picking up the signals. Tests of selection which look at haplotype structure also detect these loci because many of them seem to have swept up in frequency relatively recently. This is consonant with what ancient DNA is telling us, as a substantial proportion of modern European ancestry does derive from peoples who have been resident at high latitudes for tens of thousands of years, but new variants, possibly from the [Middle East or elsewhere](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24048645), have increased in frequency within this admixed populations (in [South Asia the same pattern is evident](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003912), as the Ancestral North Indians likely introduced West Eurasian variants into the hybrid daughter populations).

But let’s think through some of the implications of the alternative scenarios. One model is implicitly the dominant one, that the modern skin lightening alleles which are derived in contemporary populations are due to new pressures for de-pigmentation. Though some de-pigmentation likely occurred early on, perhaps even in [Neandertals](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1453.abstract), the full suite is recent. Another model is that there were other variants segregating in the older populations, and that new populations brought new variants which swept to fixation. My question is simple: **if the indigenous populations of Europe were already relatively light skinned whey did the new alleles rise in frequency so rapidly**?

Let’s unpack what I’m getting at. *OCA2* and *SLC24A5* are two loci implicated in de-pigmentation in Europeans. The regions around the selective events are highly homogenized so that there’s a long haplotype around them. This means that the causal variant was targeted by such strong selection that the flanking regions of the genome were swept upward in frequency faster than recombination could break apart the association.*SLC24A5*in particular seems to have been under very strong selection, to the point where almost all variation has been purged from European populations at this locus. In India*SLC24A5* [is also at a higher frequency](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/slc24a5-has-probably-been-under-selection-in-india/) than might be predicted by simple contribution of ANI ancestry. The issue that I’m getting at, assuming that modern continental populations such as Europeans are admixed, is **why these skin lightening alleles swept to frequency so rapidly and in the case of *SLC24A5* nearly to fixation**. It’s framed by the analysis presented by this paper, [Parallel Adaptation: One or Many Waves of Advance of an Advantageous Allele?](http://www.genetics.org/content/186/2/647.abstract):

Basically, if the ancient North Eurasian populations had lighter skin due to their own alleles, **why are the new light skin alleles sweeping up in frequency so strongly after admixture?** (for Europeans, I’m thinking *SLC45A2* and *SLC24A5* in particular). Perhaps the selective sweeps were not driven by light skin at all? Or, perhaps the ancient North Eurasians didn’t have their own variants.

**Addendum:** The 2007 Neandertal red hair [paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1453.abstract) offers up a possible solution toward phenotype reconstruction: test the ancient genetic variants in cell lines to check for expression.
