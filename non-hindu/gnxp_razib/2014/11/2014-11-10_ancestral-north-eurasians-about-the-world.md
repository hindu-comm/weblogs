Ancestral North Eurasians about the world

![**Citation**: Seguin-Orlando, Andaine, et al. “Genomic structure in Europeans dating back at least 36,200 years.” Science (2014): aaa0114.](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/maltadrift1.jpg?resize=600%2C263)

The above is a plot of shared drift (ergo, history) between Mal’ta, the 24,000 year old Siberian boy, and various world populations. As per [Lazaridis et al.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/12/23/001552) you see a north to south gradient in Europe. As per [Raghavan et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24256729) you see the evidence of a lot of contribution to Native American ancestry. The rest of the world tells an interesting story. Recall that the highest fraction of **Ancestral North Eurasia** (ANE) outside of the New World is among the peoples of the North Caucasus. Their shared drift statistic is depressed in comparison to Europeans because of their high fraction of **Basal Eurasians** (BEu). What I want you to focus on **is a secondary mode of shared drift in northwest South Asia**. The reddish tinged circle are the Kalash I am rather sure from what I have heard/seen. The **Ancestral North Indian** (ANI) ancestors of South Asians seem to resemble the people of the South Caucasus (Georgians/Armenians) from what I have read/seen (I’ve run a few f-stats and D-stats myself). If this means that have a fair share of BEu then their yellowish shading might be misleading in terms of their total ANE ancestry.

Just something to think about.

**Addendum:** Everything I’ve seen suggests that there were two movements into South Asia from the north/west. The Brahui/Baloch are very distinctive in comparison to the Kalash/Pathan/Burusho. This might be a function of continuous gene flow from distinct regions to the west as well, especially in the case of the Brahui/Baloch, who have had associations as far afield as Oman due to their geographic proximity.
