It’s a rich & important paper, but I disagree with some of the stronger interpretations that Eske Willerslev has been putting out there in the media. More to come on that. Also, I’ve been thinking a lot about Toby Wilkinson’s [The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004FGMZAI/geneexpressio-20). It really made me a much stronger believer in the importance of [institutional economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_economics). I also got a copy of Frank McGlynn’s [Marcus Aurelius: A Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0044BD5Y4/geneexpressio-20). It’s got mixed reviews, but it seems strange that there are so few biographies of Aurelius’ life. It could simply be a function of the fact that [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MBGBQVI/geneexpressio-20) serve as a window into his mind for moderns without comparison in relation to other Emperors of Rome. But it seems that it is important to understand the context of the world of the later Antonines, since arguably marks the end of the Classical Era and the first slouch toward Late Antiquity, like it or not.
