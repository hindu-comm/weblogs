Against contingency (in yeast traits)

*Quanta Magazine* has a piece up audaciously titled [Evolution’s Random Paths Lead to One Place](http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20140911-evolutions-random-paths-all-lead-to-the-same-place/). It’s basically a review of the research published in the paper [Global epistasis makes adaptation predictable despite sequence-level stochasticity](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2014/01/13/001784.DC1/001784-1.pdf). There’s a lot packed into the title. Here’s the important bit from *Quanta*:

There’s been a vogue of late for attacking the utility of mouse genetics for medical research. Perhaps studying flies, yeast, and bacteria to understand evolution is also misguided? Interesting research in any case.
