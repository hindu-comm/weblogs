Polygyny – maybe it’s agriculture

[Alexander Kim](http://sarkoboros.com/2014/09/25/lippold-et-al-2014-sex-biased-demography-across-human-history/) has already [responded in depth](http://sarkoboros.com/2014/09/25/lippold-et-al-2014-sex-biased-demography-across-human-history/) to a new paper in *Investigative Genetics*, [Human paternal and maternal demographic histories: insights from high-resolution Y chromosome and mtDNA sequences](http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/5/1/13):

Comparing male and female demographic histories can be a mug’s game. But if one is appropriately cautious some insight can be gained, and in this paper the authors are appropriately cautious. It isn’t surprising that female effective population sizes are somewhat larger over the long term and across deep history than male ones for our lineage. **We’re a mildly sexually dimorphic species, suggestive of possible mild polygyny at best, on average.** In other words, males compete, but not *that* much. Far more interesting to me is what Alexander Kim keys in on:

> Among the most interesting inferences is Holocene crash in male Ne, with no clear reflection on the mitochondrial side of things, everywhere but Oceania and America — most dramatically in the Middle East/North Africa:

![Not from the Pleistocene](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/U47P5029T2D524770F24DT201211091518531-150x75.jpg?resize=150%2C75)

As a speculative matter this might reflect the **rise of “super-male” lineages that arose with agriculture and mass society.** In other words, extreme levels of polygyny are a novel cultural evolution, which could only emerge with the level of stratification and power accumulation in patrilineages enabled by agricultural, or agro-pastoral, societies. Hyper-polgyny might also be correlated with the extreme mate guarding and sexual jealousy which is the norm among many Eurasian societies. The implication here is that many of the “regressive” social practices we associate with “traditional” Eurasian societies are simply cultural retrofits to adapt to new social circumstances enabled by mass society. Liberal individualism as an ethos may not be a novel innovation, as much as the emergence of long submerged instincts which evolved when collective institutions and interests were far weaker as forces in our day to day decision making.
