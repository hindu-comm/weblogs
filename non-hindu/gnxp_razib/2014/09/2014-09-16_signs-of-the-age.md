Signs of the age

![**Credit:** Razib Khan, taken at the Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10620006_10152375507852984_4995098444419765789_o.jpg?resize=640%2C1257)

I took the above photo at the Met in New York. What did you think when you saw the image initially? You can [read about the detailed meaning of the statue](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/94.9.2), but the short explanation is that it’s a Native American girl who stumbles upon a cross. Before 2010 the pose wouldn’t trigger any strong connotations associated with popular culture, but today it does.
