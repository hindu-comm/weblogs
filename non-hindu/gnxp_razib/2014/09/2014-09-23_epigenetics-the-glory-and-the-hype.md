Epigenetics, the glory and the hype

Epigenetics is real. But it doesn’t change everything. That needs to be said, because people seem to get the impression that everything is changed. In *Trends in Genetics*, [Serving Epigenetics Before Its Time](http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/pdf/S0168-9525(14)00119-X.pdf):

> Society prizes the rapid translation of basic biological science into > ways to prevent human illness. However, the premature rush to take > murine epigenetic findings in these directions makes impossible > demands on prospective parents and triggers serious social and ethical > questions. >
> … >
> In their efforts to anticipate the eventual human applications of > emerging areas of science, scholars of the ethical, legal, and social > implications of genetics and genomics sometimes become too speculative > to engage the immediate concerns of active scientists and > policymakers. However, although evidence-based applications of human > epigenetics may emerge in the future, premature epigenetic risk > messaging is already here and its content and impact must be > understood. The messages in circulation raise ethical and social > concerns regardless of whether human epigenetic studies eventually > confirm the murine results. Because the prospect for any successful > human translation of epigenetic research depends as much on the > management of these issues as on further human studies, they deserve > close attention by all involved in their design, dissemination, and > public consumption.
