A glass half full, half empty

A case in point, [Woman of 24 found to have no cerebellum in her brain](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329861.900-woman-of-24-found-to-have-no-cerebellum-in-her-brain.html#.VBKs1_ldV8E):

> … woman has reached the age of 24 without anyone realising she was missing a large part of her brain. **The case highlights just how adaptable the organ is.** >
> The discovery was made when the woman was admitted to the Chinese PLA > General Hospital of Jinan Military Area Command in Shandong Province > complaining of dizziness and nausea. **She told doctors she’d had problems walking steadily for most of her life, and her mother reported that she hadn’t walked until she was 7 and that her speech only became intelligible at the age of 6.**

Yes, a case of the adaptability of the brain. But she still has problems walking steadily, and that’s not a trivial matter for an “upright ape.” The structures of our brains are not coincidence, which can be discarded without consequence.
