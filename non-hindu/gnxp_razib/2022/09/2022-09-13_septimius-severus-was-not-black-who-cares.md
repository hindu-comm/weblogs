Septimius Severus was not black, who cares?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/septsev.jpg?resize=453%2C293&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/septsev.jpg?resize=453%2C293&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/septsev.jpg?ssl=1)  
Septimius Severus is important because he brought the Roman Empire back from the chaos ushered in by the assassination of Commodus. He was born in 145 AD and so grew into adulthood during the later Antonine period. He remembered the tail end of the time of peace and prosperity that characterized the reigns of the rulers up until Marcus Aurelius, who had to deal with German invasions and plague.

Though Severus and his heirs did not usher in the despotic “Dominate” phase of the Roman Empire, I think it is correct that his military regime ended some of the illusions of the late Principate. During Severus’ reign, the rubber-stamp role of the Senate faded more as he nakedly asserted that his will and word were the law.

But Severus is important for another reason. He was the first “African” Emperor. More precisely, he was born in the Libyan city of Leptis Magna, near modern Tripoli. His father was of Punic background, as Leptis Magna was once a Phoenician colony. His mother was of colonial Italian stock.

In the current era, he has become newly relevant. [Challenging the whiteness of classics – remembering the Black Romans](https://theconversation.com/challenging-the-whiteness-of-classics-remembering-the-black-romans-175180):

This gap, I suggest, derives from a systematic erasure of Black Romans from Roman history.

We have a fair amount of [ancient DNA from Rome](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/11/07/genetic-history-rome/). Combined with analysis of **ancestry tracts in modern populations** it is pretty clear that **most** of the Sub-Saharan African ancestry, that is, black ancestry, on the southern shores of the Mediterranean date to the **Islamic period** or later. Not imperial Rome.

This plot below shows consistent but usually low levels of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in southern shore Mediterranean populations today:

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pgen.1002397.g001.jpg?resize=640%2C341&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pgen.1002397.g001.jpg?resize=640%2C341&ssl=1)](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002397)  
From the paper that that plot comes from, “We estimate that a migration of western African origin into Morocco began about 40 generations ago (approximately 1,200 ya); a migration of individuals with Nilotic ancestry into Egypt occurred about 25 generations ago (approximately 750 ya).” They look at ancestry segment lengths and fit it to a model of decay over time due to recombination. It’s not rocket science.

**The upshot is that only a very small minority of the population of the Roman Empire were of black African appearance.** Though as noted by the scholar above, these people were salient and notable and crop up in the literature as objects of curiosity. Septimius Severus may have had dark skin, but that does not mean he was of black African background or identity (I have dark skin, and people routinely accuse me of being a white-adjacent Asian, so it’s not like they can’t reason when given proper incentives).

I do believe it was likely Septimius Severus was culturally Punic but of mixed heritage, as colonial settlements often exhibited a level of intermarriage with the local populations (I suspect his “Italian” mother also had indigenous ancestry due to the generations elapsed). In the case of Leptis Magna, that would be the indigenous Berber Libyans. We know what these people looked like from the Greeks and the Egyptians. Below is some reconstructed wall art:

![*Four Libyan kings on the left*](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/800px-Libyans.jpg?resize=600%2C248&ssl=1)

I would caution against taking the skin colors too literally, but the Egyptians describe and depict the Libyans as light-skinned like their West Asian neighbors, while the Nubians are shown to be darker in complexion. The Nubians are Sub-Saharan African, or black, while the Libyans are not.

What’s the point of this? Most of you know this? Well, a Ph.D. geneticist who isn’t even particularly woke pointed me to the article about Septimius Severus being black as if it wasn’t a farce. The lie has become true, even if you laugh it off.

What’s going on? Since 2020 and the “racial reckoning” white scholars have been engaging in political activism. The classicist above understands the “need” for racial representation, so is making the best case in a lawyerly manner.

Though the Greco-Romans didn’t have our racial classifications and understandings, they were not ignorant and even distinguished between the physical appearance of North and South Indians, correctly observing that South Indians resemble “Aethiopians” in color but differ in having straighter hair. The ancients were also aware that Mediterranean people differed in complexion, with Egyptians being darker in complexion than Thracians, and individuals had color terms in their names such as*Albinus*and*Niger.*

The Roman-era Egyptian [portraits](https://www.google.com/search?q=ancient+egyptian+portrait+roman&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiGscyz1ZP6AhWxd98KHcPSCa4Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=ancient+egyptian+portrait+roman&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgAQ6BggAEB4QBToGCAAQHhAIOgQIABAYOgQIABAeUJUDWMcHYIkJaABwAHgAgAGTAYgB7wOSAQM2LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=PXYhY8aeG7Hv_QbDpafwCg&bih=849&biw=1745) probably correctly depict the range in complexion in northern Africa, from relatively fair to medium-brown, with most people being brunette white or light brown. Without a deeper investigation, it is reasonable that Septimius Severus had darker skin than the average Italian, but it is also reasonable that his subjects did not perceive him to be black, or more accurately for the time “Ethiopian.” Instead, he was a provincial from Libya. Part of the problem with classicists trying to concoct a black identity and appearance for Septimius of Severus, Augustine of Hippo and Terence is that they are engaging in what is now fashionably called “erasure.” The history, achievements, and identity of the Afro-Asiatic people of North Africa, from the Maghreb to Egypt, are co-opted to make the case for black representation in antiquity because during this period the Sahara was far less penetrable than it became under Islamic states deploying camel caravans. It is one thing when Afrocentrist ideologues engage in this, but when intellectuals and scholars do so, it is very alarming.

The job of scholars in the modern West is, to tell the truth and represent facts as they are. They may miss the mark often, but they should aim as best as they can. The problem with classicists over the last few years is they temporize, equivocate, and intentionally mislead their audiences when they very well know that the North African people that suggest “may have been black” were likely no more black than the typical West Asian. This is not to say they were “white” (though many people from the MENA do identify as such today and did in the past), but scholars should have the courage to admit that the past was not black and white, and it does not always easily fit in our narratives, whether we are 19th-century Victorian white supremacists or 21st-century anti-racists.

I write this in 2022 with the clear understanding that the lie will likely become the truth. But some of you will remember the truth, and the more I write and talk about this, the more the truth shall not die. The will come when the darkness will end, and we or our descendants should be prepared to remember the world as it was rather than only have the understanding of priests who preach how it should have been.
