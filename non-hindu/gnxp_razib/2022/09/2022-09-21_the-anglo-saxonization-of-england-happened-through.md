The Anglo-Saxonization of England happened through a mass migration

[The Anglo-Saxon migration and the formation of the early English gene pool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2):

> The history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by > multiple periods of major cultural change, including the influential > transformation after the end of Roman rule, which precipitated shifts > in language, settlement patterns and material culture…The extent to > which migration from continental Europe mediated these transitions is > a matter of long-standing debate…Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA > from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans—including 278 individuals > from England—alongside archaeological data, to infer contemporary > population dynamics. We identify a substantial increase of continental > northern European ancestry in early medieval England, which is closely > related to the early medieval and present-day inhabitants of Germany > and Denmark, implying large-scale substantial migration across the > North Sea into Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the > individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to 76% of > their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone, albeit with > substantial regional variation and heterogeneity within sites. We show > that women with immigrant ancestry were more often furnished with > grave goods than women with local ancestry, whereas men with weapons > were as likely not to be of immigrant ancestry. A comparison with > present-day Britain indicates that subsequent demographic events > reduced the fraction of continental northern European ancestry while introducing further ancestry components into the English gene pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most closely related to that seen in Iron Age France

1\) More migration than earlier papers. Looks like increasing ancient DNA coverage helped  
2) 75% Y chromosomal turnover in eastern England  
3) A third component, detected in the PoBI paper, is confirmed, and seems related to continuous later gene flow from northern France. This is ubiquitous across England, and I do wonder now what the Norman Conquest and the unification of large regions of northern France with England did in the early medieval period
