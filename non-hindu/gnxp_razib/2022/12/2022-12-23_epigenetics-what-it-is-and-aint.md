Epigenetics, what it is, and ain’t

In case you didn’t see, I have a post on [epigenetics up](https://razib.substack.com/p/you-cant-take-it-with-you-straight), [You can’t take it with you: straight talk about epigenetics and intergenerational trauma](https://razib.substack.com/p/you-cant-take-it-with-you-straight), which will probably be my last word on this. But coincidentally, this preprint came out, [Lack of evidence supporting transgenerational effects of non-transmitted paternal alleles on the murine transcriptome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521797v1?rss=1):

> Transgenerational genetic effects are defined as the effects of > untransmitted parental alleles on the phenotype of their offspring. > Well-known transgenerational genetic effects, in humans and other > mammals, are the effects of a parental genotype on the nurturing > ability of the parents, coined “genetic nurture”. However, there exist > examples of transgenerational genetic effects in model organisms that > are independent of nurturing effects and support the epigenetic > transmission of a memory of the parental genotype possibly mediated by > small RNA species. To test whether such transgenerational epigenetic > effects might exist in mammals, we generated 833 isogenic C57BL/6J > (B6) mice that differed only by the presence in the genome of their > sire of one copy of four A/J chromosomes (MMU 15, 17, 19 or X). We > measured 25 anatomical traits and performed RNA-Seq on five distinct > tissues (heart, liver, pituitary, whole embryo, and placenta). There > was no evidence of a significant effect from untransmitted A/J sire > chromosome alleles, whether on anatomical traits or gene expression > level. We observed an effect on Mid1 expression levels in multiple > tissues, but this was shown to be due to a de novo mutation that occurred in one of the sire lines. We conclude that transgenerational epigenetic memory of non-transmitted paternal alleles – if it exists – is uncommon in mice and likely other mammals.

I didn’t want to get into a mud-slinging contest, but a lot of people in epigenetics are pretty skeptical of a lot of the work that’s published that shows inter-generational transmission of any sort in animals.
