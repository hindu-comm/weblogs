The Hui Muslims, two pulses of “western” ancestry 1,000 and 500 years ago, mostly male mediated

There are 20 million Hui people in China. These are traditionally Chinese-speaking Muslims. Though they are found in every region of China (and in the Chinese Diaspora), they are concentrated in the northwest, in Gansu and Ningxia in particular. Their origins have always been curious. They speak the local Chinese dialect, and look mostly Chinese, but they are traditional Muslims. Are they purely the descendants of local converts? The Hui do not believe so, and some of them physically do look more West Eurasian.

Thanks to genetics we know the answer, [Genetic Origins and Sex-Biased Admixture of the Huis](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/9/3804/6281079):

This pattern was consistent across different regions in Ningxia (fig. 3C). These results indicated that the admixture of NXH was sex biased to the combination of Eastern females and Western males.

The 39% western Y chromosomes is key. This is probably a floor for the fraction of originally Muslim lineages. The Hui likely had Iranian and Turkic precursors, and the latter would have had eastern Y chromosomes. But the point is that cultural continuity was maintained in paternal lineage systems, and over the generations intermarriage with local Han women resulted in 90% of the genome being replaced over time.

This is a common pattern in large parts of the world. Paternal cultural transmission is a thing.
