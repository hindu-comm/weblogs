Is ancient DNA a biased view?

Over at my Substack [Iberia: Ancient Europe’s Edge of the Earth (part 1) – Unpacking prehistoric Spanish and Portuguese genetics](https://razib.substack.com/p/iberia-ancient-europes-edge-of-the?s=w) elicited a comment from [Walter Bodmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bodmer) questioning the representative of ancient burials (i.e., were they just elites?).

My response:

– I bet forager societies were in HWE. That is, there’s no major stratification due to class since class differences are minimal/attenuated.

– A single genome has been pretty predictive of future and past diversity for a given population (e.g., WHG).

– There are populations, like India’s, that are highly stratified by class for many centuries (thousands of years?). But this is the exception, not the rule.
