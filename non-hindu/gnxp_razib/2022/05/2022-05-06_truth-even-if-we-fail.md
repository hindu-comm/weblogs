Truth, even if we fail

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/A1wunR129hL.jpeg?resize=200%2C302&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/A1wunR129hL.jpeg?resize=200%2C302&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)There is an internet/social media controversy about the new book, [The Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20). The book itself is fine. I have a copy though I haven’t read it. It’s basically a revision of the idea of the Dark Ages.

The content of the book isn’t what I’m going to post about. Rather, there’s a social media controversy that I want to make a quick comment on as it relates to “academic culture” in the US. If you want details, Jesse Singal is going to do a [podcast](https://www.blockedandreported.org/about) on the topic, and you can check out the hashtag [\#brightAgesSoWhite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BrightAgesSoWhite?src=hashtag_click) to get a sense.

Here’s the summary.

1.  [The Bright
    Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)
    gets assigned to be reviewed by a white woke academic (WWA) to a
    woman of color woke academic (WoCWA). 2.  The review is really really negative. If you look for it online, you
    can make your own judgment, but I think it is very unfair to the
    authors. Basically, WoCWA was out to engage in a “hit.” 3.  There is a dispute between the WWA and WoCWA about edits and the
    former basically rejects the review. The latter is very angry. 4.  Next, accusations of racism etc. fly, and initially the WWA engages
    in what are now called “white woman tears” in social justice
    parlance. WWA was being attacked pretty harshly online, so her
    response was surely sincere, but her attackers responded that her
    recourse to tears hurt people who were marginalized (nonwhites). The
    issue here is who/whom. WWA deploying tears against a
    nonmarginalized person (white male) would have been a winning move. 5.  Part of the issue goes to connections between WWA and the authors of
    [The Bright
    Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)
    (they are friendly), as well as between a positive reviewer and the
    authors. Accusations of nepotism and racism fly. 6.  Eventually, WWA apologizes. She gets attacked for apologizing not
    vociferously enough, or fast enough. She deactivates her Twitter
    account. 7.  Other people start to get attacked. People who defended WWA
    position, or pushed back on WoCWA. The authors of[The Bright
    Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)
    get attacked as well as privileged white men. Screenshots are made
    of people who “liked” tweets that WWA or others made defending
    themselves for later reference to assemble a dossier of “very bad
    people”. 8.  The authors of[The Bright
    Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)
    are very woke. In fact, I’m 99% sure David Perry, one of the
    coauthors, has joined in on one of the periodic online
    academic-twitter pile-ons on me at some point. The other author
    doesn’t believe in cancel culture, and is a very smug woke white
    man.

There are many more details, but that’s the main sketch. The whole incident was brought to my attention by a friend in academia who was at one point criticized as a possible white supremacist (or sympathetic) by WWA for a minor intellectual disagreement (he’s a white male). The point is that WWA and the coauthors of [The Bright Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20) are very excited and happy to deploy identitarian arguments against people they disagree with, so it’s hard to feel very sad about what’s happening to them now. They are being consumed by the Sandworms that they normally ride.

If you look through [\#brightAgesSoWhite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BrightAgesSoWhite?src=hashtag_click) you see many people acting horribly and being bullies. **If you know some history you know that this isn’t surprising, and these people think they are being righteous**. The targets of the bullying themselves actually are self-righteous bullies from what I can tell, so lots of bad apples here.

Academics in most disciplines are incestuous and engage in a lot of back-scratching. Academia is an archipelago of “communities” with various social norms, and despite all the talk about “equity and inclusion” the dominant players are still upper-middle-class white people who often have a family connection to the institution (academics are more likely to spawn other academics than almost any other field). Weirdly (or not), many white academics I’m privately friendly with have told me of instances of casual anti-Asian prejudice and racism from “woke” white people, assuming that my friend (nonwoke) would agree.

The loudest promoters of DEI in performance are probably white academics from these connected backgrounds who live in white college towns and are totally personally unacquainted with “diversity” and “inclusion.” Look at the racial breakdown of the Census Tract that WWA lives in, for example. That doesn’t look like America. Some of the angriest attacks on me on Twitter get triggered when I point out this hypocrisy since there’s an “honor among thieves” code where people don’t point these things out too much lest comfy sinecures get disturbed.

What to think about the controversy and[The Bright Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091WLWB4X//geneexpressio-20)? I am old-fashioned. What is true? What is right? What is illuminating our understanding of the past in all its complexity? **The identity and feelings of academics are secondary because humans are secondary to the knowledge they engage with and produce**. We will always miss the mark, and we will always be hypocrites, and never really live up to the standards that the quest for truth demands of us, but we should keep trying.

But this quest is no longer in the sights of many academics online. Rather, they are focused on feelings, identity and politics. When you make academia more about social justice than the truth, this is what you get. I am pessimistic about American academia being able to reverse gears on this, because when a young nonwhite woman sees a white woman advancing in her career by savaging a white male academic on identitarian grounds, why shouldn’t the nonwhite woman do unto the white woman what she’d have done unto her? The shared ethos for truth is gone, and all is now power. It’s sad.

I myself have defended people who are white males who were attacked unfairly, who later on denounced me because it was the expedient thing to do. People are weak individually, so I am not surprised. But in the aggregate, there’s a rot in the institution. Do these people know it? I don’t really know. I think most are not that self-aware.

**Addendum:** some of my “best” informants are white people who are not American or are from working to lower class backgrounds. They often see the hypocrisies because they are outside of the charmed pedigree networks of the genuinely privileged white people despite their race. The paradox of academia is that it mouths egalitarianism, but practices a hierarchical system with a prestige caste system of institutions and pedigreed-networks.
