Nick Patterson responds to Feldman and Riskin’s NYRB piece

[Nick Patterson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-OVm5iMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) has [responded](https://npatterson.substack.com/api/v1/file/5cfd3be0-80bd-4cff-a1a4-ce840e53a6a1.pdf) on his [Substack](https://npatterson.substack.com/p/a-very-bad-review?s=r) to the *NYRB* piece [Why Biology is not Destiny](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/04/21/why-biology-is-not-destiny-genetic-lottery-kathryn-harden/), which itself is an attack on [Kathryn Paige Harden’s](https://twitter.com/kph3k?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) book [The Genetic Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M//geneexpressio-20). Patterson does not say anything you can’t find in Stuart Ritchie’s [defense](https://stuartritchie.substack.com/p/scientific-nihilism?s=r), but he is at this stage in his career a very eminent scholar operating from a perch in one of the world’s most [prominent](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/) population genetics laboratories. So him speaking publically is worthwhile in my opinion, since a lot of this is going to shake out in credential thumping and status signaling ([Marcus Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Feldman) in particular is a massive deal in population genetics so it needs to be responded to those in senior positions)…
