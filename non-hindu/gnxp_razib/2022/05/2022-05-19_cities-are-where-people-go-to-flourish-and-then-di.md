Cities are where people go to flourish, and then die

[Stable population structure in Europe since the Iron Age, despite high mobility](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.15.491973v1?rss=1):

This is the most important: ‘According to a longstanding historical hypothesis, the **Urban Graveyard Effect**, the influx of migrants in city-centers disproportionately contributed to death rate over birth rate; a process which would contribute to observing individuals as “transient” migrants…’

To me, it confirms that the urban demographics of the ancient world were always transient because of low total fertility.
