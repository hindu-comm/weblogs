The two Pleistocene people of Europe

[Dual ancestries and ecologies of the Late Glacial Palaeolithic in Britain](http://Dual%20ancestries%20and%20ecologies%20of%20the%20Late%20Glacial%20Palaeolithic%20in%20Britain):

> Genetic investigations of Upper Palaeolithic Europe have revealed a > complex and transformative history of human population movements and > ancestries, with evidence of several instances of genetic change > across the European continent in the period following the Last Glacial > Maximum (LGM). Concurrent with these genetic shifts, the post-LGM > period is characterized by a series of significant climatic changes, > population expansions and cultural diversification. Britain lies at > the extreme northwest corner of post-LGM expansion and its earliest > Late Glacial human occupation remains unclear. Here we present genetic > data from Palaeolithic human individuals in the United Kingdom and the > oldest human DNA thus far obtained from Britain or Ireland. We > determine that a Late Upper Palaeolithic individual from Gough’s Cave > probably traced all its ancestry to Magdalenian-associated individuals > closely related to those from sites such as El Mirón Cave, Spain, and > Troisième Caverne in Goyet, Belgium. However, an individual from > Kendrick’s Cave shows no evidence of having ancestry related to the > Gough’s Cave individual. Instead, the Kendrick’s Cave individual > traces its ancestry to groups who expanded across Europe during the > Late Glacial and are represented at sites such as Villabruna, Italy. > Furthermore, the individuals differ not only in their genetic ancestry > profiles but also in their mortuary practices and their diets and > ecologies, as evidenced through stable isotope analyses. This finding mirrors patterns of dual genetic ancestry and admixture previously detected in Iberia but may suggest a more drastic genetic turnover in northwestern Europe than in the southwest.

Cool paper that shows that the British can still get some things done. Basically, they found that genetically and culturally there were really two different populations in late Pleistocene Europe, and that the earlier post-Magdelenaian populations left some impact on the mostly Villabruna-descended populations like Cheddar Man.
