Wolf paleogenomics

[Grey wolf genomic history reveals a dual ancestry of dogs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04824-9):

> The grey wolf (Canis lupus) was the first species to give rise to a > domestic population, and they remained widespread throughout the last > Ice Age when many other large mammal species went extinct. Little is > known, however, about the history and possible extinction of past wolf > populations or when and where the wolf progenitors of the present-day > dog lineage (Canis familiaris) lived1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we analysed > 72 ancient wolf genomes spanning the last 100,000 years from Europe, > Siberia and North America. We found that wolf populations were highly > connected throughout the Late Pleistocene, with levels of > differentiation an order of magnitude lower than they are today. This > population connectivity allowed us to detect natural selection across > the time series, including rapid fixation of mutations in the gene > IFT88 40,000â€“30,000 years ago. We show that dogs are overall more > closely related to ancient wolves from eastern Eurasia than to those > from western Eurasia, suggesting a domestication process in the east. > However, we also found that dogs in the Near East and Africa derive up > to half of their ancestry from a distinct population related to modern > southwest Eurasian wolves, reflecting either an independent > domestication process or admixture from local wolves. None of the > analysed ancient wolf genomes is a direct match for either of these > dog ancestries, meaning that the exact progenitor populations remain > to be located.

Dog stuff makes the headlines, but I think the wolf stuff is the most interesting in this paper.
