The last glacial maximum bottlenecks and human phylogeny

I’ve mentioned [The genomic origins of the world’s first farmers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742200455X) a few times. It’s an intense model-based paper that revises some expectations and models of the origins of diverse human groups on the cusp of the Holocene:

A few things to note about this paper. First, no mention of Basal Eurasians. This research group doesn’t believe they’re necessary. As you may know, Basal Eurasians were hypothesized because Mesolithic Europeans seem genetically closer to eastern non-Africans than to incoming Early European Farmers (EEF) from Anatolia. One model that can explain this is that there was a population somewhere in N. Africa and W. Asia that split off first from other non-Africans, perhaps more than 60,000 years ago and that eventually merged back with West Eurasians at some point. Lazaridis et al. also believe this might explain why some W. Asia groups have less Neanderthal ancestry; the Basal Eurasians did not admix with them.

The problem, so far, is that nearly a decade after they were hypothesized we haven’t found a mostly Basal Eurasian sample. And, Basal ancestry is found in West Eurasia pretty early. Perhaps they’ll always remain a statistical construct?

Why doesn’t everyone think Basal Eurasians are necessary? If you read the above paper, **the key issue is the distortionary impact that bottlenecks can have on the inferred branch lengths of a given phylogeny.** They argue that a **very strong bottleneck** during the LGM 20,000 years ago inflated the divergence of European foragers from other populations and that subsequently, the populations bounced back very well so that their census sizes were likely large. And, they also argue that some of the distinctiveness of EEF from Anatolia is a function of their own bottleneck far more recently, around the beginning of the Holocene. Combined with these bottlenecks there are also various migrations between the branches in the typology, branches differentially impacted by these bottlenecks.

I don’t know how this aligns with earlier models, but I think it’s a serious contender. The key question I wonder is how this fits in with earlier ancient DNA and archaeology.
