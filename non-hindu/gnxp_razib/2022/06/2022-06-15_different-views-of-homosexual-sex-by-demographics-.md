Different views of homosexual sex by demographics (Democrats)

Ethan Strauss has a post up, [On Forcing Enemies to Fake Their Beliefs – Why does the sports media want Tampa Bay Rays players to pretend they’re supportive of Pride?](https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/on-forcing-enemies-to-fake-their?s=r), where he comments on the fact that the push in corporate sports to be socially progressive is being driven by college-educated white staff, and probably in contradiction to the personal views of most players. Strauss is a former sports reporter, and he knows these sorts of guys personally, so he’s almost certainly correct.

Impressionistically it does seem that young white liberals sometimes forget that not everyone is at the same point on social issues.

To test that out, I decided to look at the HOMOSEX variable for 2018-2022. Do people think homosexual sex is wrong? And if so, who?

First, let’s look at white non-Hispanics.

Though conservative whites are split, liberal whites are almost totally in agreement that homosexual sex is not wrong at all (the residual are generally very old if you use the COHORT variable).

How bout black Americans? The same size is smaller, so I decided to just look at ideology.

Self-described liberal blacks are only somewhat more liberal on homosexual sex than non-Hispanic white conservatives.

Let’s compare black Democrats to white Democrats.

Black Democrats basically have the same views as conservative non-Hispanic whites. The contrast with college-educated white Democrats is pretty striking.
