The persistence of Neolithic Y chromosomes at Orkeny

[Ancient DNA at the edge of the world: Continental immigration and the persistence of Neolithic male lineages in Bronze Age Orkney](https://www.pnas.org/content/119/8/e2108001119):

This process of preferential assimilation seems likely to have continued for many generations, given the extent of replacement of the remainder of the Orcadian Neolithic genome. >

Basically, a Y chromosomal lineage assimilated from Iberian hunter-gatherers, and assimilated into Neolithic farmers, seems to have spread over the British Isles and persisted in a part of Orkney as the dominant paternal line for 1,000 years after it was overwhelmed elsewhere.
