Happy DNA Day (and whole genome sequencing yourself)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/logo-blueontransparent1.jpeg?resize=640%2C334&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/logo-blueontransparent1.jpeg?resize=640%2C334&ssl=1)](https://nebula.org/whole-genome-sequencing-dna-test/)

Today is “DNA Day,” I checked [Nebula Genomics](https://nebula.org/whole-genome-sequencing-dna-test/) website to see if there was a deal. So I got the 30x whole genome sequencing for \$199+\$24.99/month subscription. The deal is you have to get the subscription, but you can cancel at any time. What I plan to do is just download my data when the results come back and the subscription starts ticking, and cancel after that. The other options are more expensive. But, they won’t let you add more than 1 item unless you get the most expensive upfront deal, so what I did was just started separate carts and sent the order to separate email addresses.

And yes, I have my own DNA sequenced. This is for friends and family.

If you want to download my whole genome sequence, from raw reads to bam files to vcf’s, go [here](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2021/10/26/razib-khan-30x-whole-genome-sequence-data/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=razib-khan-30x-whole-genome-sequence-data).

**Update:** It was pointed out to me that quarterly would charge \$75 as it will be \$25 per month quarterly (3 months).
