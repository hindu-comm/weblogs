Avars were Rourans

[genomes reveal origin and rapid trans-Eurasian migration of 7th century Avar elites](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00267-7):

No big surprises, but I think it is important to note that it looks like the East Eurasian Avar elites brought a lot of Iranian-steppe people as cadet elites. So a lot of the elite non-East Eurasian ancestry turns out to be non-European, and more Central Eurasian (probably Alanic and the like).
