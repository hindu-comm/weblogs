I’ve been on the record of being skeptical of a lot of content being generated on YouTube, but I think the author [Dan Davis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVwT8zcS5Z_rYXnpomlbfg) does a really great job. The topics overlap with a lot of my interests. For example, he has videos on the [Corded Ware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecmeQT7R7rk), the [Sintashta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNdLXKtWg3A), and the [koryos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbIwi1HxmpE). Since he relies on a lot of the primary scholarship I do I can evaluate his representation and it’s all true, and all accurate. Of course, it’s video, **so I recommend you read the primary sources at some point**. But Davis’ 15-30 minute videos are a reasonable length and relatively well-produced, so an excellent introduction.

Davis is the author of two novels about the early Indo-Europeans, [Godborn](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08BJD2CGQ/geneexpressio-20) and [Thunderer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08XGWW971/geneexpressio-20). You can also get the prequel novel free on his [website](https://dandavisauthor.com/).
