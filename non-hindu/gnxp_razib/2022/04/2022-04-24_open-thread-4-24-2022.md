It’s mostly science, and not too much about von Neumann’s personal life, though there is some that is there. The only negative I’d give is that because von Neumann died early the author includes some discussion about people who extended and furthered von Neumann’s legacy near the end of the book.

[Survival of Late Pleistocene Hunter-Gatherer Ancestry in the Iberian Peninsula](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219301459). Southern Spain was a refuge for Neanderthals, and it looks like it was for Magdelanian people as well.

[Patterns of genetic differentiation and the footprints of historical migrations in the Iberian Peninsula](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08272-w). I forgot that most of Spain’s genetic variation was west-east instead of north-south. Pretty strange.

[Do members of Homo floresiensis still inhabit the Indonesian island where their fossils helped identify a new human species fewer than 20 years ago?](https://www.the-scientist.com/magazine-issue/opinion-another-species-of-hominin-may-still-be-alive-69869?fbclid=IwAR0ouBWTUSZdVPkDokJG-gWn_vPu6uoNrDXCgTd48F3rvzgzq6j1v0oO6Xc) This piece in *The Scientist* is triggering a massive media frenzy, but as the British would say, it’s “rubbish.” Basically an anthropology chooses to put weight on eyewitness accounts of local people. It’s really hard to hide medium-sized mammals, especially on an island like Flores. I doubt they’re still around.

[Euro Vision (part 1)](https://razib.substack.com/p/euro-vision-part-1?s=w). Second part out very soon.
