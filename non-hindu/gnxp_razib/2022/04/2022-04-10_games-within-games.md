Games within games

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theessentialtalmud.jpeg?resize=197%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theessentialtalmud.jpeg?resize=197%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ADO767S/geneexpressio-20)Many years ago I read [Adin Steinsaltz’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Steinsaltz) [The Essential Talmud](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ADO767S/geneexpressio-20). Steinsaltz was a Charedi (Chasidic more specifically) rabbi who spoke about the text and work from the perspective of an insider. One of the major insights I recalled is that to obtain esteem, eminence and status, rabbinical scholars would engage in deep exegesis of Jewish law, and work to extend the purview of *Halakah*. Steinsaltz was very precise that the process always involved extension, not retraction. The law grew more ornate and restrictive over time, explaining why there is a [pre-modern basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_vegetarianism#In_pre-modern_times) for the recent vogue for [veganism among very pious Jews](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/there-is-no-kosher-meat-the-israelis-full-of-zeal-for-going-vegan), as a plant-based diet is by definition*kosher*. Some observant Jews are skeptical that any contemporary form of animal slaughter can adhere to the letter of God’s law.

From the perspective of a devout Jew, as Steinsaltz was, there is nothing more important than the law handed down from God. He was quite dismissive of secular philosophical inquiry, reiterating that the most learned rabbis imbibed such wisdom only so long as it furthered their understanding of scripture and the commentaries of their predecessors. The quest for learning undertaken by religious scholars was the most important task in the whole world for Steinsaltz, with everyone else taking on a supportive role in supporting the scholars. The production of a more unwieldy *Halakah*was the price one paid for getting closer to the intent behind God’s law.

But from the outside one can observe other dynamics. Arguably Jewish law was essential for maintaining the cohesion of the Jewish people for thousands of years. With the exception of schismatics, after the rise of Christianity Jews all across the world were united by their adherence to the written and oral Torah, and the rules and regulations of *Halakah*kept them distinct from their gentile neighbors, more, or less. In this way, religious commentary served a functional role on the scale of the community. But competition between scholars occurred in the context of a zero-sum game. There could only be one most eminent rabbi in a city. Over time individual rabbis produced more and more ornate interpretations of the law that rendered Rabbinical Judaism somewhat an odd fit in early modern Europe. There was no way that a pious Jew could integrate into the social and professional world of the gentile, so there emerged Reform Judaism (which did involve retraction of Jewish law from the lives of Jews).

The moral of this lesson is that a functional characteristic that has a group-level utility, furthering cohesion and forwarding some collective aim, can produce perverse incentives when individuals compete among each other to be the more clever and devout of all and then impose their new norms on the whole population.

I did read [The Essential Talmud](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ADO767S/geneexpressio-20). But my point isn’t about Orthodox Jews, it’s about American academics. As the high priests of the hall monitor caste like to opine, “this too is problematic.”
