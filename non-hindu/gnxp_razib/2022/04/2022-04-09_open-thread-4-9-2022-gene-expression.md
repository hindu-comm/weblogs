Open Thread – 4/9/2022 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/81GkCg0vrwS.jpeg?resize=186%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/81GkCg0vrwS.jpeg?resize=186%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B098TYZN67/geneexpressio-20)I’ve been reading [The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B098TYZN67/geneexpressio-20) before I go to sleep. Not sure I would recommend this, as the author, Ananyo Bhattacharya, does get a bit into the mathematical questions von Neumann explored in his early life. But overall, very readable, and so far von Neumann is sketched out as a very human individual (he was mediocre at chess, for example).

I talked about immigration (US) and migration with regards to Ukraine in particular with [Alex Nowrasteh](https://razib.substack.com/p/alex-nowrasteh-the-last-migration?s=w). It was a good conversation, in part because we are friendly with each other off the interwebs. I plan on posting a discussion with someone less amenable to “open borders” in the near future (stay tuned!).

The von Neumann book has made me push [A Dominant Character: How J. B. S. Haldane Transformed Genetics, Became a Communist, and Risked His Neck for Science: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of J. B. S. Haldane](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07ZTS751R/geneexpressio-20) up my stack. Despite Haldane’s political radicalism, I do want to note that on the science he was very much aligned with the conservative, R. A. Fisher.
