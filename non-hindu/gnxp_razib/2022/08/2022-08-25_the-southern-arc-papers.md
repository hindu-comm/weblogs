The southern arc papers

Since [David](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/) has not posted, here they are…

[The genetic history of the Southern Arc: A bridge between West Asia and Europe](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4247):

> By sequencing 727 ancient individuals from the Southern Arc (Anatolia > and its neighbors in Southeastern Europe and West Asia) over 10,000 > years, we contextualize its Chalcolithic period and Bronze Age (about > 5000 to 1000 BCE), when extensive gene flow entangled it with the > Eurasian steppe. Two streams of migration transmitted Caucasus and > Anatolian/Levantine ancestry northward, and the Yamnaya pastoralists, > formed on the steppe, then spread southward into the Balkans and > across the Caucasus into Armenia, where they left numerous patrilineal > descendants. Anatolia was transformed by intra–West Asian gene flow, > with negligible impact of the later Yamnaya migrations. This contrasts > with all other regions where Indo-European languages were spoken, suggesting that the homeland of the Indo-Anatolian language family was in West Asia, with only secondary dispersals of non-Anatolian Indo-Europeans from the steppe.

[A genetic probe into the ancient and medieval history of Southern Europe and West Asia](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq0755):

> Literary and archaeological sources have preserved a rich history of > Southern Europe and West Asia since the Bronze Age that can be > complemented by genetics. Mycenaean period elites in Greece did not > differ from the general population and included both people with some > steppe ancestry and others, like the Griffin Warrior, without it. > Similarly, people in the central area of the Urartian Kingdom around > Lake Van lacked the steppe ancestry characteristic of the kingdom’s > northern provinces. Anatolia exhibited extraordinary continuity down > to the Roman and Byzantine periods, with its people serving as the demographic core of much of the Roman Empire, including the city of Rome itself. During medieval times, migrations associated with Slavic and Turkic speakers profoundly affected the region.

And, [Ancient DNA from Mesopotamia suggests distinct Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic migrations into Anatolia](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq0762):

> We present the first ancient DNA data from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic > of Mesopotamia (Southeastern Turkey and Northern Iraq), Cyprus, and > the Northwestern Zagros, along with the first data from Neolithic > Armenia. We show that these and neighboring populations were formed > through admixture of pre-Neolithic sources related to Anatolian, > Caucasus, and Levantine hunter-gatherers, forming a Neolithic > continuum of ancestry mirroring the geography of West Asia. By > analyzing Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic populations of Anatolia, > we show that the former were derived from admixture between > Mesopotamian-related and local Epipaleolithic-related sources, but the latter experienced additional Levantine-related gene flow, thus documenting at least two pulses of migration from the Fertile Crescent heartland to the early farmers of Anatolia.

I haven’t read the supplements, so no major comment from me, except for one: **the Greece-focused paper confirms using phenotypic prediction that West Eurasians have been getting lighter-complected since the late Neolithic/Bronze Age**. I have no idea why, but some Nazis are offended by this reality and cherry-pick data, but trust me, I open up all the supplements to look at the HIRIS-plex predictions.
