The replacement of the Neandersovan Y and mtDNA?

Harvard Magazine has a nice piece up on [David Reich’s biography and research](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/07/feature-ancient-dna). The section where Reich addresses the strange issues regarding Neanderthals jumped out at me, as I’ve had the same confused thoughts:

As the data accumulate, and the > tools become more sophisticated and powerful, he has begun revisiting > some of his own prior interpretations of human prehistory, and coming > to terms with what he describes as “weird signals in the current > data.” Mitochondrial DNA shows that modern humans and Neanderthals are > much more closely related to each other in the maternal line than > either is to Denisovans.

The model that I’ve had a role in building is teetering. I find that exciting, as well as destabilizing. And I’d like to be part of trying to figure out the truth.”

Neanderthals clearly have a bit of “modern” human-like DNA from paleo-Africans. On the order of a few percent. But strangely, their Y and mtDNA seem to fit into a lade with modern humans, as opposed to the Neanderthal’s Denisovan cousins. This isn’t impossible; over time rare lineages will replace common ones. But what’s the chance that **both** Y and mtDNA from humans would replace that of Neanderthals? (probability of fixation of a new mutation is 1 over the number of gene copies)
