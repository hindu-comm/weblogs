Only the inner party

True, there were Northerners like Martin van Buren who became President, but they headed a Southern-dominated coalition. By the 1850s this alignment was not stable because the North was developing industrially and outpacing the population of the South. Nevertheless, it took some time for a realignment to occur, where the Mid-Atlantic regions of the North began to vote with Greater New England as a unit, and so would serve as the basis for Republican domination for decades until FDR broke the old parties.

The 1856 election shows the last time that the old alliance won out, as you can see that the Republican candidate had very little support outside of Greater New England. The combination of the moral fervor of the anti-slavery movement, which eventually won over the whole North, and the unreasonable expectations of the numerically inferior South, eventually brought the rest of the North to the Republican party.

Today I feel I see a bit of the reverse. [The Liberal Patriot](https://theliberalpatriot.substack.com/p/working-class-and-hispanic-voters) has a post up, [Working Class and Hispanic Voters Are Losing Interest in the Party of Abortion, Gun Control and the January 6th Hearings](https://theliberalpatriot.substack.com/p/working-class-and-hispanic-voters), that shows the Democrat party catering more and more to the interests of college-educated whites, their intelligentsia. One of the arguments you saw around 2010 is that the McGovern coalition of liberal whites and minorities was now actually feasible. But this presupposed that minorities continued to vote Democrat at the same rates as before. The reality is that minorities without college educations are drifting away from the Democratic party.

What’s left then? The Democrats know what it’s like to run a huge and fractious coalition. With fewer and fewer moderates the party will finally have moral clarity. But victory? That I doubt.
