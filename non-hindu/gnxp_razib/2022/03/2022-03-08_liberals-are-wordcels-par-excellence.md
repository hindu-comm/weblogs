Liberals are wordcels par excellence

Matt Yglesias asks why [more selective colleges are more left-wing](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1500894883137130504?s=20&t=EwCaHmCizmVc9piX38Kk3A). There are several reasons, but I think one of them is that liberals just tend to have somewhat higher verbal, and that really matters at the “tails” of the distribution.

Below is some data from the GSS. I limited the sample to non-Hispanic whites (which means it’s from the year 2000 and later), and stratified by low, average and high vocab score (0-5,6-8 and 9-10), and crossed that with political ideology. Then, I also broke it down by those with noncollege education, those with bachelor’s degrees and those with graduate degrees. There’s just a bigger pool of very verbally strong liberals (or, being verbally strong makes you liberal, I don’t know).
