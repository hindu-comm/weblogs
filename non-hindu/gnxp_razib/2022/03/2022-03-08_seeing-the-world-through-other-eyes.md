Seeing the world through other eyes

As most of you know [I am the child of Bangladeshi immigrants to the US](https://razib.substack.com/p/get-lucky?s=w). I don’t make much of my “identity” because it rests lightly on me, and is not a major concern. I’ve been to Bangladesh twice in the last 40 years. My views on ascriptive identity are old-fashioned, you should listen to me because I am a human, not because of my sex, gender, class, race or religion. My experience and background are not trivial, but neither are they the most important thing.

But sometimes they do matter. Recently I saw this Tweet:

This person lives in Washington D.C. and refers to herself as “Tree-hugging, granola-crunching, whale-saving, ACLU card-carrying, liberal Democrat; world traveler; tennis fanatic; animal lover; political junkie and activist.”

I think it is understandable that Lithuania is angry considering its geopolitical circumstances. The cancelation of the shipment seems petty, but it’s obviously within their rights, and for historical reasons, Lithuanians are extremely passionate about the current conflict in Ukraine and look very negatively upon Russia.

But what about Bangladesh? Here I can actually offer some personal perspective, because my parents grew up in Bangladesh (East Pakistan), and much of my family lives in Bangladesh. **On the whole, feelings toward Russia are warm, if somewhat distant and abstract**. On a geopolitical level, Russia has been a “friend” to both India and Bangladesh for decades. This is not just a theory at the scale of the nation-state, there were personal connections, as Indians and Bangladeshis traveled to the Soviet Union to study, and the USSR sent advisors to the subcontinent. On the merits Indians and Bangladeshis may not be comfortable with the Russian invasion, but should they turn their back so quickly on a relationship that goes back decades? Will Western countries embrace India and Bangladesh with open arms to reward them for their actions?

For Bangladesh, there is a more concrete historical reason for Russophilia: t**he Soviet Union was in the end on the side of India and the soon-to-be Bangladesh during the 1971 conflict with Pakistan**. Because the US was a staunch ally of Pakistan, the official government’s position was to ignore evidence of [massive human rights atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Blood#The_Blood_telegram) being reported by their own diplomats. The Bengali civilian death toll is usually given to be in the range of \~100,000 to 2 million. The latter figure actually comes from Pravda, and I think there is reason to be skeptical that 1 out of 33 Bengalis in East Pakistan were killed. But the \~100,000 figure is possibly too low. In any case, it wouldn’t be a trivial death toll even if it was around 100,000, and the need for widespread abortion clinics after the war attests to [mass rapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bangladesh_Liberation_War#Aftermath) (the rape had a eugenic intent, a Pakistani general asserted that they would “change the race of this bastard nation”).

The Nixon administration even took some threatening moves with naval power once India intervened and was clearly going to defeat Pakistan, aided by the Bengali nationalist left-wing militias. The Soviet Union mobilized its own naval power to check the US. People of my parent’s generation remember these events with some clarity (my mother was shot by Pakistani soldiers).

In 1972 Bangladesh was founded as the “People’s Republic of Bangladesh.” The name should make it clear that Bangladesh’s origin was as a secular socialist left-nationalist nation-state. Over the decades many things have changed, in particular, the rise of a more Islamic self-conception and the shift away from socialism to export-oriented capitalism. But the founding myth of a socialist nationalist struggle remains, and people of my parents’ generation remain strongly influenced by 1970’s Third World socialism.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a disaster for geopolitical stability, and now the world economy. It’s been a disaster for Ukraine, and Russia is not really benefiting so much in material terms. I am personally terrified of the increased risks of nuclear war. All that being said, are the Russians intent on a war of total subjugation laced with genocide? My own understanding is that they thought Ukrainian nationalism was a paper tiger and that the corrupt government would fall and they would take over quickly. The Ukraine invasion is far more important than the genocide in Bangladesh in the early 1970’s (that targeted Hindus and intellectuals) because the fate of the world hangs in the balance, even if the probabilities are low. But to be candid on the grand scale of humanitarian disasters I doubt the civilian death count will reach anything like what happened in Bangladesh. Would Bangladeshis really want to sacrifice the old friendship for abstractions about the international order? Or a humanitarian crisis of far lesser magnitude than what they themselves went through two generations ago?

In the years after 9/11 the US went through foreign policy disasters because it refused the understand the world that it tried to change. There are other histories and other viewpoints out there. You may not agree with them, but they are there nevertheless.
