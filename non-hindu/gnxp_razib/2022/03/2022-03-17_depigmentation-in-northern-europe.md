Depigmentation in Northern Europe

If you read this blog closely over the years you will know that Iâ€™ve noticed that the ancient DNA has yielded the general result that Bronze Age Europeans were somewhat darker in complexion than their modern descendants. This is without mass overall population genetic change in many areas. This is not always statistically significant, but you can tell a likelihood before something hits p = 0.05.

The ancient DNA temporal transects are pretty good for Britain. The best in Europe. And the above preprint seems to present a strong result of depigmentation over the last 4,500 years in Britain using powerful new methods drawing on ancient DNA sources. I strongly suspect this generalizes to much of Northern Europe.
