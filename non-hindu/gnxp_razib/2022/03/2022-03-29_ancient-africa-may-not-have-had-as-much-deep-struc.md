Ancient Africa may not have had as much deep structure as we think

[A weakly structured stem for human origins in Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.485528v1):

Privately some people have been grumbling about models of deep structure between very differentiated populations for a while. They claim this is just a bias in the model specifications because it’s so easy to think of gene flow happening in periodic pulse admixtures. But the reality is that Africa doesn’t seem to have had the same barriers as across Eurasia or between Eurasia and Africa, so how are these deep lineages persisting?

The preprint here shows that the data can fit a different model, one that they find more biologically and paleoanthropologically more reasonable. The discussion has an “out of Africa with total replacement” flavor, but here it is *within* Africa:

> Multiple studies have shown a correspondence between phenotypic > differentiation, usually assessed with measurements of the cranium, > and genetic differentiation among human populations and between humans > and Neanderthals 36,37,38 (see also Section 5.3). This correspondence > allows predictions of our model to be related to the fossil record. > The fossil record of Africa is sparse during the time period of the > stems, but of the available fossils, some are very similar in > morphology to contemporary humans (e.g., from Omo Kibish, Ethiopia > 39,40), others are similar in some morphological features but not > others (e.g., from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco 1,41), and others are very > different in morphology (e.g., from Dinaledi, South Africa 42,43). If, > as our model predicts, the genetic differences between the stems were > comparable to those among contemporary human populations, the most > morphologically divergent fossils are unlikely to represent branches > that contributed appreciably to contemporary human ancestries.

This result would recenter Omo Kibish from what I can tell.
