Is Sichuan cuisine the best there ever was?

![This is what I ate on Tuesday night](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8174_10153349228637984_4401582017240353204_n.jpg?resize=640%2C360)

I am of the generation of people who purchase experiences, rather than things. OK, well, at least my bias is toward experiences, rather than things. For several years now I have had an obsession with [Sichuan cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine). I was introduced to one particular restaurant in a major American city by a Chinese (Fujian-born and bred) coworker, and now every time I am in that particular city on business I make a sojourn to that restaurant. In my fever dreams I fantasize about synthesizing Sichuan and Korean, two of my favorites.

My question: **is East Asian cuisine, and in particular Chinese, simply *better* in some Platonic sense?** If so, what are you favorite restaurants? If not, what are your favorite restaurants?

I’m trying a new Sichuan place tomorrow which has great Yelp reviews. Hope I’m not disappointed….
