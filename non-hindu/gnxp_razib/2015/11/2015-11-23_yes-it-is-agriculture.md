Yes, it is agriculture

[![000e553e_medium](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/000e553e_medium.jpeg?resize=137%2C206)![000e553e_medium](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/000e553e_medium.jpeg?resize=137%2C206)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008P1J9US/geneexpressio-20)In 2007 a friend told me of an encounter at a seminar where [L. L. Cavalli-Sforza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza) seem to offer agriculture almost reflexively as a solution to the conundrum of signals of positive selection in the genome of humans. Basically, all paths led to agriculture. I have to say that nearly ten years later Cavalli-Sforza’s deep intuition on these issues seems to be vindicated. Agriculture was an enormously big deal.

Carl Zimmer in *The New York Times* has a write up of [Matheison et al.](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature16152.epdf?referrer_access_token=zrPtTOD9zHsEFJlzUxrRxNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MnVrBcbOUxeDwMEyOFwmvxdndV3GwJP6NXwe5AOu3Qv-EhGjiAgbO3cLP83TL3qdCVAjkTSyg0eanGeSl1hYOrlnJyHJLjd9UMC1jB44cg7BixtfPK3QkvGmkxl6AydlAj_PHHIJyQq0Bb9kiPWX9nWVYJIBAVlf4IZnlf2G90TT9IMb7do8r5LbX5okSn2Jha2tY9p6xxNOhXu5Hy5HZz02oKsbVGpkMYo8iz76gj5JGKV6nGMzuPeZrOC4WtfbwulG83uJGdFZsP6kZ_6Ofa9GddzRCF-ytfyFWERKpdS7iP2fnAL9g0uNc7n4pBEcrcJnRk_mZ9KmsjVB9d6zn2gMKzR7oOGET00JaueuHl2A%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.nytimes.com) (it’s in *Nature*), [Agriculture Linked to DNA Changes in Ancient Europe](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/science/agriculture-linked-to-dna-changes-in-ancient-europe.html). There aren’t a whole lot of surprises, as the [pre-print](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/10/016477) has been around for a year or so. But, having the work written up in a newspaper allows researchers to engage in some extemporaneous speculation. Ergo, you have:

> Why? Scientists have long thought that light skin helped capture more vitamin D in sunlight at high latitudes. But early hunter-gatherers managed well with dark skin. Dr. Reich suggests that they got enough vitamin D in the meat they caught. >
> He hypothesizes that it was the shift to agriculture, which reduced the intake of vitamin D, that may have triggered a change in skin color.

This was to some extent Cavalli-Sforza’s idea, and [I’ve proposed it as well](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Razib_Khan/publication/43246829_Diet_disease_and_pigment_variation_in_humans/links/0c96052cd2b6e4762a000000.pdf). Then there is the model of [sexual selection](http://www.unz.com/pfrost/the-puzzle-of-european-hair-eye-and-skin-color-2/). These theories aren’t always exclusive, and pigmentation may have multi-causal underpinnings. It is very interesting that the best methods and ancient DNA seem to be suggesting lots of very recent change and likely adaptation. **But ultimately, we still have no clear idea.**
