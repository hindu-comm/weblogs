Rapture for the discerning non-model biologist

Very excited that a pre-print I’ve seen come into focus over the past year by my labmate Omar is finally out, [RAD Capture (Rapture): Flexible and efficient sequence-based genotyping](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/11/028837):

Genomic complexity > reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction > enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per > unit cost.

The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and medical science.

This is very much about the methods, but there’s some interesting fish-genomics results, too. More of that in the next year or so. We can’t all be human or model-organism biologists, so this is excellent for those working in ecological, conservation, and more broadly non-model contexts. For a lot of this work, and population-genomic research as well, you don’t need medical-grade 30✕ whole genome coverage. That being said, this being a pre-print which is going to be revised and submitted, I’d suggest that Omar remove the stuff about medical utility. That’s a domain where they’ll kill them with coverage and the best technology, not the most cost-effective one.
