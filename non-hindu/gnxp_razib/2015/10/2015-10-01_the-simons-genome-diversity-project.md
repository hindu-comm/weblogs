The Simons Genome Diversity Project

Over at [Eurogenes](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-1000-genomes-paper-global-reference.html) there was a casual mention of the [Simons Genome Diversity Project](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/). This is kind of a big deal, because as the map above shows you **this project has really good population coverage**. Additionally, the quality of the genomes are very good. The vast majority are in the 30× to 50× range, with all over 20× ([coverage](https://www.broadinstitute.org/crd/wiki/index.php/Read_coverage#Read_coverage_of_a_genome) basically gives you a sense of how many times a particular position is likely to have been sampled by sequence reads, ergo, how accurate your call for a polymoprhism is and such).

The tranche of papers for this project doesn’t seem to have started coming out yet, and the researchers have asked people to not report genome-wide results if they get permission to download it. It’s a total of 10 **terabytes** of data. Below is a table of the populations with counts. Remember that with high coverage whole genomes even one individual can give you lots of inferences (e.g., [PSMC](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7357/full/nature10231.html)).
