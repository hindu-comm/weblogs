So you want to be a population geneticist/genomicist?

[![hartle](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hartle.jpg?resize=260%2C334)![hartle](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hartle.jpg?resize=260%2C334)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)A friend of mine is beginning grad school and has settled upon a lab. The core research within the laboratory is population genomics, and they now need to get up to speed in the area. Taking a class is certainly the start. You can read [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) to keep up on the literature, which is a necessity if you are doing genomics work, as texts get out of date quickly. Additionally, [Graham Coop](http://gcbias.org/population-genetics-notes/), [Joe Felsenstein](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/pgbook/pgbook.html) and [Kent Holsinger](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecturenotes/notes.html) have excellent online notes. The upside to this is that they are free. The downside is sometimes you are away from a computer screen. Often a soft intro recommended by many is John Gillespie’s [Population Genetics: A Concise Guide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801880092/geneexpressio-20), which nicely has a [Kindle edition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004M1905O/geneexpressio-20). But if you are going to do graduate level work, I think it is best to just go whole hog. The Gillespie book is appropriate for a quick course or for the undergraduate level, but you really need something as a reference at some point. And for that nothing beats Daniel Hartl and Andrew Clark’s [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20). There are other texts out there in this area. For example, I have Philip Hedrick’s [Genetics of Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0763757373/geneexpressio-20), and Alan Templeton’s [Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409510/geneexpressio-20). For various reasons I would still pick Hartl & Clark if I had to pick.

It’s an excellent complement to [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) because it starts with pop gen foundations. Derek Roff’s [Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041212971X/geneexpressio-20) and Michael Lynch and Bruce Walsh’s [Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934812/geneexpressio-20) are probably too specialized for the beginner, and frankly even many steeped in the field haven’t read those books.

[![slatkinnielsen](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/slatkinnielsen-227x300.jpg?resize=227%2C300)![slatkinnielsen](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/slatkinnielsen-227x300.jpg?resize=227%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605351539/geneexpressio-20)There are plenty of other books out there which might suffice in some fashion. In my previous post I mentioned [Elements of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20). The old John Maynard Smith classic [Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20) is also excellent. But if you are working in genomics and want a book less focused on classical methods and geared toward contemporary best practices, then Rasmus Nielsen and Monty Slatkin’s [An Introduction to Population Genetics: Theory and Applications](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1605351539/geneexpressio-20) is pretty good. It’s a short book, and because it’s in its first edition there are many errors in it. From what I recall it was developed out of notes from a course taught at Berkeley, and it outlines the sort of methods you see in the papers which being published today, utilizing coalescent theory and site frequency spectra. It might be a reasonable quickstart, though I’m not sure it is developed well enough to be a reference (for what it’s worth, I have a copy of it too, and it is being used in graduate level courses here at UC Davis).
