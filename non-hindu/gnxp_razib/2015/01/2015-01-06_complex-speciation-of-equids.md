Complex speciation of equids

![Jónsson, Hákon, et al. “Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111.52 (2014): 18655-18660.](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/equid1.jpeg?resize=600%2C504)

Last week I [expressed my qualms about allopatric speciation the biological species concept](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/between-the-tree-ring/). I didn’t quite say it that way, but that’s really what I was getting at. When talking about the phylogenetic relationship of *populations* the level of species is just another systematic layer. Arguably its the only one that’s “natural” or “fundamental.” And that is because of the role of the biological species concept. Basically, that refers to the fact that two species are labeled as such when they can’t exchange genes through hybridization. As I have noted before **this is very much an *instrumental* standard, and *not* an iron law.** For whatever reason the new vogue among paleoanthropologists seems to be to label Neandertals a separate species (e.g., *H. neanderthalensis*). That doesn’t bother me, but, please do remember that there’s now a rather overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence that \~2% of the ancestry of most modern humans, *H. sapiens*, derives from this population. Because of the deficiency of Neandertal ancestry in the X chromosome, a common indicator of hybrid breakdown, we can infer that the \~500,000 year old separation between the African root stock of *sapiens* and *neanderthalensis*, was not without consequences. The biological species concept is useful, but not as an iron law. Rather, it is a reference point at one end of the distribution of the viscosity of gene flow between two populations.

And this is one area where whole genome sequences seem to be resulting in changes in perceptions. A paper in PNAS emphasizes this for equids, primarily donkeys and zebras, [Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453089).

There’s a lot in this paper which I will elide. For example, like most large species during the Pleistocene it seems that we need to start rethinking the importance of meta-population dynamics. But interestingly the evidence of gene flow across lineages reinforces the result that **chromosome number differences are no barrier to hybridization.** This should be obvious in some ways with equids, Przewalski’s horse has a different number than the domestic horse! I wouldn’t be surprised if this pattern of gene flow, especially near the root of the emergence of a lineage which we define as a “species”, is not uncommon with mobile genuses which span the world island.

And going back to hominins and hominoids, the title is a reference to a 2006 paper, [Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7097/full/nature04789.html). The argument in that paper was that there was evidence of hybridization events after the initial divergence. This is highly disputed, and I haven’t followed the literature closely. **But after all that we’ve found out about hybridization between distant lineages within *Homo* since 2006 should we surprised that this would occur within Africa in the incipient *Pan* and *Homo* lineages?**

Last month *Aeon Magazine* asked: [Genes that leap from one species to another are more common than we thought. Does this shake up the tree of life?](http://aeon.co/magazine/science/how-horizontal-gene-transfer-changes-evolutionary-theory/) Perhaps. But it shouldn’t. The universe is far more wondrous than can be imagined in our small philosophy.
