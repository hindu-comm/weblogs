Among the Rationalists

![Michael Vassar](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Michael_Vassar-84x150.jpg?resize=84%2C150)

*Harpers* has an interesting article up, *Come With Us If You Want To Live: Among the apocalyptic libertarians of Silicon Valley*. Here’s an [ungated version](https://pdf.yt/d/-jQQX6XY9dU0LN4G). There’s a lot of space given over to the musings of my long-time friend [Michael Vassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vassar). I have to admit that the writer does impart effectively the Michael’s general affect. To me this quote from Michael is very important:

> “The current ecosystem is so totally fucked up,” Vassar said. “But if > you have conversations here”—he gestured at the hotel—“**people change > their mind** and learn and update and change their behaviors in > response to the things they say and learn. That never happens anywhere > else.”

This is true. Not as true as you would hope, but it happens. The fact that you could change someone’s mind in one single conversation is the reason I spent a fair amount of time with the “Less Wrong community” between 2008 and 2011, and still consider many of them friends and acquaintances (I’ve drifted a bit since starting grad school in 2011, but I keep in touch and see them whenever I’m in SF or NYC).

In the article above I know basically all of the non-famous people listed on some level personally. A lot of the description is a little gratuitous, but I have to concede that the author accurately conveyed the aesthetic. Though the stuff about apocalyptic *libertarianism* is way overdone. For most of the time I’ve known Michael his politics have been that of a moderate Democrat, though he’s open to heterodoxy, and sounded like a post-political elitist who had soured on possibility of genuine capitalism the last time I talked to him at length (in September of 2014). Eliezer does call himself a small-l-libertarian, but he isn’t very political, and he was a supporter of Barack Obama from what I recall. Among the run-of-the-mill people who associate with LW and MIRI the dominant ethos is nerd, not libertarian. Here’s the [2013 LW survey results for politics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jj0/2013_survey_results/):

> **POLITICAL:**  
> Communist: 11, .7%  
> Conservative: 64, 3.9%  
> Liberal: 580, 35.5%  
> Libertarian: 437, 26.7%  
> Socialist: 502, 30.7%  
> Did not answer: 42, 2.6% >
> **COMPLEX POLITICAL WITH WRITE-IN:**  
> Anarchist: 52, 3.2%  
> Conservative: 16, 1.0%  
> Futarchist: 42, 2.6%  
> Left-libertarian: 142, 8.7%  
> Liberal: 5  
> Moderate: 53, 3.2%  
> Pragmatist: 110, 6.7%  
> Progressive: 206, 12.6%  
> Reactionary: 40, 2.4%  
> Social democrat: 154, 9.5%  
> Socialist: 135, 8.2%  
> Did not answer: 26.2%

I suspect the libertarianism aspect had more to do with the role of Peter Thiel\* in the community, and, the fact that this piece was being published in *Harper’s*, where the idea of apocalyptic *libertarians* would be an easy pitch. One can find the same apocalyptic aspect to many environmentalist movements, but I doubt they’d be as interesting to *Harper’s* readers since they’d be sympathetic to that sort of apocalyptic pessimism.

\* In relation to Thiel’s politics, I should add that many LW/Singulatarian people I’ve talked to are in total denial about his viewpoints when they deviate from their own. Some progressives who admire him refuse to believe that he’s a conservative-libertarian. Others are totally confused as to his avowal that he is some sort of Christian.
