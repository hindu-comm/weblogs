The search for Indo-Europeans in comment sections

[![horsewheellanguage](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/horsewheellanguage-197x300.gif?resize=197%2C300)![horsewheellanguage](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/horsewheellanguage-197x300.gif?resize=197%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20)David Reich and Nick Patterson come down in favor of the steppe as the *ur-heimat* of the Indo-Europeans, at least those who migrated into Europe, in a recent [abstract](http://www.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/?id=1696):

> We generated genome-wide data from 65 Europeans who lived between > 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target > set of about 390,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms.

This is broadly the same data which Iosif Lazaridis presented at ASHG 2014. So this itself is not new. But what I would like to draw your attention to are two posts over at [Eurogenes](http://eurogenes.blogspot.com.au/), [Ancient DNA points to the Eurasian steppe as a proximate source for Indo-European migrations into Europe](http://eurogenes.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/ancient-dna-points-to-eurasian-steppe.html), and [Yamnaya genomes are a 50/50 mix of eastern Euro foragers and something else ANE-rich](http://eurogenes.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/yamnaya-genomes-are-5050-mix-of-eastern.html). Nick Patterson actually weighed in over in the comment thread for the first post. A [comment](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2015/01/yamnaya-genomes-are-5050-mix-of-eastern.html?showComment=1422047051822#c8017804418203059413) in the second post was especially amusing:

> Over 400 comments on an abstract? You may need to start a forum when the actual paper is released, David.

[![insearchof](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/insearchof-210x300.jpg?resize=210%2C300)![insearchof](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/insearchof-210x300.jpg?resize=210%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0500276161/geneexpressio-20)Yes, there were over 400 comments on the first post. It shows you how passionate people get about this issue. Some of the associations within this field are of a racialist nature. [The Journal of Indo-European Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Indo-European_Studies) was founded by [Roger Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Pearson_(anthropologist)), though today it is edited by the respectable [J. P. Mallory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Mallory). This is not to say that all of those enthusiastic about this topic are quite so “out there,” but it’s quite emotional.

Until the paper itself comes out I suggest readers bone up on the archaeology, because there’s a wealth of that out there already. From what I recall the Samara samples were form David Anthony, and his [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20) is basically required reading in my opinion if you are interested in this issue. Also, Mallory’s older [In Search of Indo-Europeans](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0500276161/geneexpressio-20) is probably worth reading as well. We live in interesting times indeed!
