Increased de novo mutations for older fathers

![**Citation:** Whole-genome sequencing of quartet families with autism spectrum disorder](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/patage.jpg?resize=600%2C298)

The above is from the supplements of [Whole-genome sequencing of quartet families with autism spectrum disorder](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.3792.html). You can read about the research in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/27/health/autism-diagnosis-in-siblings-serves-as-poor-indicator-of-risk.html). I just wanted to highlight the above scatterplot, especially panel A, in the interests of pro-natalist alarmism about older fathers.
