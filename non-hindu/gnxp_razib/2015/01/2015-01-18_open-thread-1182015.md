I read his [How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0029F1C1U/geneexpressio-20) years ago, so no surprises. He’s a military historian, so battles, down to the alignment of maniples and details of logistics, operate in the foreground. Not normally my cup of tea, but a nice change up from the focus on social history which seems to be more common today in these sorts of treatments. I also have some [Anthony Evrett](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=anthony%20everett&sprefix=anthony+ev%2Cdigital-text%2C241) biographies on deck, but I think I’ll probably hit Ian Morris’ [War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00FOB3IU4/geneexpressio-20) first. It’s the sort of “big history” which is a better complement to the sort of narrative history that Goldsworthy seems adept at writing.

One thing about [The Fall of Carthage](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GU3ASJ4/geneexpressio-20) (and to some extent the author’s works more generally) that I like is that it dispels some of the preconceptions we have about pre-modern hand to hand conflict. In particular, a lot of our mental image is what Goldsworthy would term “cinematic.” The reality is that a lot of the pitched battles were very tentative, and full action probably occurred for less than 15 minutes, even if extended hostilities could go on for as long as hours.

**Update:** I don’t link to other blogs much, partly because I don’t have much time to read them with my other obligations, but [Pseudoerasmus](http://pseudoerasmus.com/) runs a shop with very high intellectual quality. Recommended. In a similar vein, [Scholars Gate](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/).
