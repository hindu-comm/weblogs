None of us are Caesar’s wife

Yesterday I tweeted out an [article](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/), [Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/). The title, and frankly, the story is a bit slanted. I wasn’t totally comfortable about the piece…**but I really hate the soft drink industry.** So much of our obesity problem would go away if people stopped drinking the stuff. The funding does not **necessarily** entail a particular conclusion. Rather, conclusions can lead to funding. But, we’ve all seen the research which suggests that pharmaceutical companies do trials which have suspiciously high success rates. And scientists are human beings,and it seems that even unconsciously biases can slip in. We need to balance the tensions and not get carried away by an extreme perspective about the nature of human motivations. Scholars are no saints.

**But the ultimate focus should be on the science.** That’s really what’s at the heart of the matter. My friend [Kevin Klatt](https://nutrevolve.blogspot.com/2015/08/funding-tale-of-defamation.html), who studies nutrition at Cornell, outlines his own concerns at length about *The New York Times* piece, [Funding: Tales of Defamation](https://nutrevolve.blogspot.com/2015/08/funding-tale-of-defamation.html):

What’s a scientist to do? This is a fallen world, and we are of it. Obviously there are cases where the conflict of interest is extreme. But often funding from private sources is what researchers have to do to keep their work afloat. If money was what scientists were after…they would actually go work for their funders.

Second, I want to point you to what’s going on with [Kevin Folta](https://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-radical-activist-attack-of-teacher.html). He’s a passionate researcher at University of Florida who works on GMOs. You know where this is going. [The Radical Activist Attack on a Teacher](https://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-radical-activist-attack-of-teacher.html):

Kevin’s been put on blast by activists. It’s Mon\$santo all the time. He’ll persevere, because he didn’t do anything wrong and untoward. But now those who are not heavily engaged on the topic are going to have to discern whether Monstanto is poisoning our crops and buying our scientists.

I guess it shows that sometimes the substance of science matters less than style. No one really knows anything about nutrition. I exaggerate for effect, but you know of what I speak. In contrast, we know a fair amount about GMO. But in both cases there are passionate public debates, and egos being bruised and reputations shredded.

I’m glad I’m not very controversial!
