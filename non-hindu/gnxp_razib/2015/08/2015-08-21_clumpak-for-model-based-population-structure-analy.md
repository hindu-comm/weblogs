CLUMPAK, for model-based population structure analysis

This isn’t probably aimed at most readers, but I think it’s important to pass the word around, so, [Clumpak: a program for identifying clustering modes and packaging population structure inferences across K](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12387/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=). An [ungated version](http://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/papers/Kopelman_et_al-2015-Molecular_Ecology_Resources.pdf). From the abstract:

> The identification of the genetic structure of populations from > multilocus genotype data has become a central component of modern > population-genetic data analysis. Application of model-based > clustering programs often entails a number of steps, in which the user > considers different modelling assumptions, compares results across > different predetermined values of the number of assumed clusters (a > parameter typically denoted*K*), examines multiple independent runs > for each fixed value of*K*, and distinguishes among runs belonging to > substantially distinct clustering solutions. Here, we > presentclumpak(Cluster Markov Packager Across*K*), a method that > automates the postprocessing of results of model-based population > structure analyses. For analysing multiple independent runs at a > single*K*value,clumpakidentifies sets of highly similar runs, > separating distinct groups of runs that represent distinct modes in > the space of possible solutions. This procedure, which generates a > consensus solution for each distinct mode, is performed by the use of > a Markov clustering algorithm that relies on a similarity matrix > between replicate runs, as computed by the softwareclumpp. > Next,clumpakidentifies an optimal alignment of inferred clusters > across different values of*K*, extending a similar approach > implemented for a fixed*K*inclumppand simplifying the comparison > of clustering results across > different*K*values.clumpakincorporates additional features, such > as implementations of methods for choosing*K*and comparing solutions > obtained by different programs, models, or data subsets.clumpak, > available at[http://clumpak.tau.ac.il](http://clumpak.tau.ac.il/ "Link to external resource: http://clumpak.tau.ac.il"), simplifies the use of model-based analyses of population structure in population genetics and molecular ecology.

The website deploys the package as a [web based application](http://clumpak.tau.ac.il./index.html) (kind of like Structure-harvester). I don’t do GUIs, but I thought I would mention it (the package is downloadable). I’ve shied away from posting admixture barplots not because I think they lack utility. **Rather, over the years readers have had a hard time understanding their limitations, and tend to reify a little too much for my taste.**
