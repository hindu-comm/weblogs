One interesting aspect about Japanese history during the [Tokugawa period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period) is that though the nation was relatively isolated from European influences, there was much more interaction with Korea and China.

My wife sent me this link, [A Four-Year Old Reviews the French Laundry](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/5607-a-four-year-old-reviews-the-french-laundry). Impressed that she actually tried most of the items.
