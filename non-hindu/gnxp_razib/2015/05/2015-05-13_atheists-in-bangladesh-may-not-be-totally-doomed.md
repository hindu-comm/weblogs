Atheists in Bangladesh may not be totally doomed

By now you are aware that another blogger who happened to be an atheist [was killed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/12/bangladeshi-secular-blogger-ananta-bijoy-das-hacked-to-death-in-third-fatal-attack-this-year/). The modus operandi is pretty familiar. It looks like there are now “hits” going up against these individuals as a way for Islamic radicals to target an easy to scapegoat minority in Bangladesh. Atheists are now caught in a crossfire between religious nationalists and secularists, a divide which goes back to the Pakistan days. How vulnerable are the atheists? Well:

> “The culture of impunity that has spread over the last few years > clearly has very damning results,” Arifur Rahman told IHEU after Washiqur Rahman was killed. “… The word ‘Nastik’ (atheist) has been vilified in Bangladesh (and the rest of the Muslim world); they are seen as sub-human, it is OK to kill them.”

All cultures are not the same. In most of the Islamic world sufferance would be enough for many minorities. While craven Leftists wring their hands over insults to Islamic minorities in their midst, Islamic civilization is wrecking havoc upon the liberties of millions. That being said, there is a continuum. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, and Azerbaijan are not interchangeable. There are some analogies being made to Pakistan right now (like being analogized to Mississippi in the United States this is never good). That’s apposite at this particular moment because [45 Ismaili Muslims have been gunned down](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32717321) in Karachi. It strikes me that Pakistani sectarianism is now proceeding down a [Bonhoefferian Niemöllerian gangplank](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/first-they-came-for-the-communists-but-i-was-not/1500680.html), first dehumanizing non-Muslims, and then progressively narrowing the set acceptable. The nation is on the way to being a literal circular firing squad.

Bangladesh is a different case. I won’t rehash it. I will point out though that when I posted about my own identity, as an [atheist of Bangladeshi origin](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/i-am-a-bangladeshi-atheist/), that when put that on[reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/31lytz/i_am_a_bangladeshi_atheist/) the response by one individual was “Who cares”? Obviously there are many things in Bangladesh that warrant attention, but, targeted killing of a reviled minority is apparently not worth notice by some. Fair enough, I suppose.

But I’m not here to emote and reflect. Rather, **what does the data say?** The World Values Survey has data from Bangaldesh for 1999 to 2004. One of the questions asks: **Politicians who don’t believe in God unfit for public office.** It seems a rough gauge for attitudes toward atheists. The results are below.

![Atheist_htm_4ce6039](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Atheist_htm_4ce6039.png?resize=640%2C904)![Atheist_htm_4ce6039](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Atheist_htm_4ce6039.png?resize=640%2C904)

**As you can see Bangladesh is roughly in the middle of the list.** Observe the contrast with Pakistan. Hostility toward atheism is the majority position in all likelihood, but protests of people in the face of Islamist terror, as well as the persistence of atheists in Bangladeshi culture, indicates that there is a sufficient groundswell of liberal religious civil society that there’s a shot. In contrast in Pakistan you have a society which is now at total conformity when it comes to toleration for free thought.
