[Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu) is a pretty big deal, and I’ve long been intrigued by him as an individual after reading about him and his contemporaries in the novel [Taiko](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AJN4W16/geneexpressio-20). Also, Japan seems a good way to investigate the possibilities of how one becomes modern without being fully Western.

Stanford is hosting [BAPG XII](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T23W5iBJ5vNUhQJtU4ppKGSCG9Y8ITv_HD9kg4lxa9A/edit#gid=1) in two weeks. Unless something intervenes I’ll be attending as usual. I also assume that the excessive population genomics tweeting will lose me some followers, as is the norm.

Had a good chat with [Iain Mathieson](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=uiLwrZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) today, as I swung through Berkeley (had Peking duck for lunch and Texas barbecue for dinner!). It’s a good time to be alive and be interested in human evolutionary genomics.

Lots of comments below on my post on [Asian Americans and university admissions](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/asian-americans-lack-good-character/). I don’t really have a strong opinion as to how admissions should be handled. As usual my sentiment is to make a plea for honesty and candor. But I’m probably being naive and hopeless about it all.

**Update:** I’m in the third & fourth segments.
