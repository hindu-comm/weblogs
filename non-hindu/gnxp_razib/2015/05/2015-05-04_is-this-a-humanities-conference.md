Is this a humanities conference?

*The New York Times* has a painful write-up of what a humanities conference is like, [The Conference Manifesto](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/the-conference-manifesto). My question is pretty straightforward: **is this really representative?** E.g., reading line-by-line from papers? Readers with experience as asked to weight in.
