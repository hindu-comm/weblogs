Asian Americans lack “good character”

*The Wall Street Journal* is reporting on a suit brought by Asian American organizations, [Harvard Accused of Bias Against Asian-Americans](http://www.wsj.com/articles/asian-american-organizations-seek-federal-probe-of-harvard-admission-policies-1431719348):

> The complaint, filed by a coalition of 64 organizations, says the > university has set quotas to keep the numbers of Asian-American > students significantly lower than the quality of their applications > merits. It cites third-party academic research on the SAT exam showing > that Asian-Americans have to score on average about 140 points higher > than white students, 270 points higher than Hispanic students and 450 points higher than African-American students to equal their chances of gaining admission to Harvard. The exam is scored on a 2400-point scale.

Ron Unz, among others, [has written about this](http://www.unz.com/runz/asian-quotas-in-the-ivy-league-we-see-nothing/), before. So not a big surprise as to the underlying empirical trends. Liberal commentator and Harvard grad [Matt Yglesias has talked about the patterns for years](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/02/14/harvard_and_princeton_clearly_discriminate_against_asian_appliants_the_question_is_whether_it_s_illegal.html). It’s an open secret. The question is whether anyone cares, and whether the legal system will do anything about.

But let me note something, a lawyer defending Harvard notes:

> Robert Iuliano, Harvard’s general counsel, said the school’s > admissions policies are “fully compliant with the law.” The school says its admissions process takes into account a variety of factors besides academics, including applicants’ extracurricular activities and **leadership qualities.**

![This is what a leader looks like](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elon_Musk_-_The_Summit_2013-300x268.jpg?resize=300%2C268)

It strikes me as unlikely that Asian American applicants lack extracurricular activities. Though first generation immigrants may come from societies where academic achievement is the *summum bonum*, they know that in American admissions criteria that non-academic strengths matter. But, **you can’t manufacture leadership and charisma.** Harvard’s role is to educate and inculcate the leaders of the next generation of Americans. It is the training ground for our natural aristocracy. Can American society actually conceive of a situation where 40% of those leaders are Asian? I doubt it. Asian Americans are not seen as plausible leaders. Especially by the established oligarchs, who would prefer their own offspring to inherit the mantles of power. Asian males in particular exhibit a “penalty” in the [dating game](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-race-affects-whether-people-write-you-back/). White females perceive them to be sexually impotent (on average), and for better or worse the opinions of white females as to who is a plausible leader in our society is very telling. If American women won’t want have to have sex with them, then why would the broader society see them as creditable leaders?

This is related to something [Josh Harkinson](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/05/asians-tech-glass-ceiling-hidden-plain-sight-ascend-study) at *Mother Jones* pointed out recently: **Asians are far underrepresented in top management in relation to their representation among rank and file workers, especially in technical positions, in Silicon Valley.** This is well known. People make all sorts of excuses for this. For example, a large number of the Asians are immigrants to the children of immigrants, who may not have the “social capital” to be successful in management at an American firm.

For me, here’s the upshot: **we just need to be honest**. Perhaps the cultural skills and dispositions that Asian Americans bring to the labor force are naturally more amenable to technical positions and professions like medicine than they are to management. It may not be as much discrimination, even of the implicit sort, as opposed to the natural sorting of personality types. This is an option we may need to entertain, rather than assuming that it is all invidious discrimination. It does strike me as obvious that Harvard and other Ivy League schools are attempting to racially balance by putting their fingers on the admission knobs in just the perfect manner. Though I’m not particularly happy about this, being transparent and honest would at least allow us to address what’s going on, and wonder whether we should do something about it. The fact is that Asian Americans are doing relatively well, even if their proportion at Harvard is 20% instead of 40%. Do we as a society need to abolish all discrimination by any means necessary? I’d say no.
