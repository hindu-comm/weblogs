It’s about equal parts travelogue, ethnography, and historical speculation. Though not a scholarly work there’s a lot of peculiar and fascinating data. I’d recommend the book, and will probably have a longer review up at some point. [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2014/10/22/358055515/disappearing-religions-charted-in-heirs-to-forgotten-kingdoms) had an interview with the author a while back, in part because he has a chapter about the Yezidis, who were in the news at the time because of the attack of ISIS on Sinjar.

So I have determined that I’m going to go to [ASHG 2015](http://www.ashg.org/2015meeting/) and [PAG](http://www.intlpag.org/) as far as conferences go in the near future, though I’m a little confused why ASHG decided to pick Baltimore rather than D.C.. I assume there’ll be a Bay Area Population Genomics meeting before that of course.

It’s strange, but I’ve noticed something about Twitter for me. I’ve been on since April of 2009. I finally topped 6,000 followers. That’s fine, but it’s literally \~1,000 followers per year. Below you can see the Twitter analytics, which dates to August of 2012. It’s basically a linear progression, except for a kink here and there.

Also, I’ll be on the third episode of [Through the Wormhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Wormhole#Season_6_.282015.29). Premiers mid-May.
