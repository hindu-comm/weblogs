I’ve been reading [Inventing the Individual: The Origins of Western Liberalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674417534/geneexpressio-20), and it is a beautiful book, full of style and erudition, and paragraph after paragraph of mellifluous argumentation. It is far more gossamer than Victor Lieberman’s [Strange Parallels](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521530369/geneexpressio-20), which is weighted down by turgid prose. But where Lieberman’s narrative is dense in unique and distinctive data, Larry Siedentop’s [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674417534/geneexpressio-20) circles around the same big facts. Siedentop promotes a bold, if not original, thesis, **that the Hebrew-Hellenic synthesis which became Christianity was the seed for the invention of liberal individualism, which reigns ascendant today, at least in name if not reality.** Lieberman makes an observation about the parallel development of societies across Eurasia, even in its isolated and far-flung regions in the protected peninsulas and archipelagos of Southeast Asia, and gropes confusedly at overarching explanations. And yet it is the “ugly duckling” of [Strange Parallels](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521530369/geneexpressio-20) that is more satisfying than the crisp and elegant theses of [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674417534/geneexpressio-20). The latter is a joy to read, but if you know a fair amount of [![61LXo6U7a4L.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/61LXo6U7a4L._SY344_BO1204203200_1.jpg?resize=231%2C346)![61LXo6U7a4L.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/61LXo6U7a4L._SY344_BO1204203200_1.jpg?resize=231%2C346)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003AT11FG/geneexpressio-20)history, and cross-cultural history at that (I do), a lot of it comes off as hot air and naked assertion. It’s a great read, but will only persuade the persuaded, and unfortunately is a little thinner on “dense description” than I would have liked for a work which I knew I was going to look at skeptically (that is, even if you find a work uncongenial on the whole, there are often great gains to be made in extracting nuggets of information).

The ultimate problem that confronts me when entertaining the core contention of [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674417534/geneexpressio-20) is sentences such as the following on page 77: “But texts are facts. And the facts remain.” The question is whether they are non-trivial facts, and that is debatable. There is a school of thought that ideas are the drivers of history, and [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674417534/geneexpressio-20) takes that position as a premise. If one is wobbly on that premise, the force of the argument falls flat.

Second, do readers have any particular papers/books on domestication that they think are particularly good? My professional research focus is in this area and I need to do a thorough survey of the literature.

Third, I am not an “adaptationist” as [Larry Moran](http://sandwalk.blogspot.ca/2015/04/does-natural-selection-constrain.html) has asserted. I’m “dynamic agnostic,” and am wary of null hypotheses of what drives variation in organisms as a whole (i.e., I think neutrality may be more justified for some branches of the tree of life than others).

Fourth, I should mention again that if you are following an RSS feed for my content, <http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed> is preferred. The reason is that it bundles all my content, and I don’t like to cross-post notifications across blogs. E.g., if I write for *The Guardian* again or something it will show up in that feed, and I’m liable not to mention it on this blog (though it will show up in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/) since that pushes the above feed).
