Pretty busy with life right now. Cleaning up the house for Easter.

I have no idea what the motivations here were, though I suppose the authors were aiming at a non-academic audience.

Also, Derek Roff’s [Modeling Evolution: An Introduction to Numerical Methods](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199571147/geneexpressio-20) arrived in the mail. It is *not*a coffee table book.

**Update:** Public service announcement. If your name is not Ron Unz and you are telling me what I should and shouldn’t post about, you will probably be banned from commenting. I’ve pretty much ignored reader advice in this area for 15 years (here’s looking at you Ikram) and will continue to do so.
