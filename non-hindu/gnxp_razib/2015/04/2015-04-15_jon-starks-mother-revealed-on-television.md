Jon Stark’s mother revealed on television?

[![A-Game-of-Thrones-Bantam-Spectra](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Game-of-Thrones-Bantam-Spectra-185x300.jpg?resize=185%2C300)![A-Game-of-Thrones-Bantam-Spectra](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Game-of-Thrones-Bantam-Spectra-185x300.jpg?resize=185%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20)On January 23rd of 1999 I had just finished Paul Gottfried and Thomas Fleming’s [The Conservative Movement](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805797246/geneexpressio-20). My roommate was pretty high, as usual (it was a Saturday). A few weeks earlier I’d gotten a paperback of a fantasy novel, [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20). I read a few pages, and then went to sleep. The next morning, Sunday, I began to read more. **I did not finish until very late Sunday evening/Monday morning.** I happened to have had a midterm in a biochemistry course the next day. I did not do so well. In a month the first edition of the sequel, [Clash of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20), came out. Satisfaction! In the year 2000 the British edition of the third book, [A Storm of Swords](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FBFN1U/geneexpressio-20), was published a few months earlier than the American one. I special ordered it from England so I could read it ahead of time. After I read [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20) I emailed George R. R. Martin, and he actually responded, though it took about a year. He apologized for being responsible for mydifficult midterm. He also confirmed that Bernard Cornwell’s [Warlord Chronciles](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006WOVK52/geneexpressio-20) were similar in feel, if not directly influential, to his series.

Like many I was patient, though frustrated, by the delays after [A Storm of Swords](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FBFN1U/geneexpressio-20). Like many readers I also believe that [A Dance with Dragons](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553582011/geneexpressio-20) and [A Feast for Crows](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FCKGPC/geneexpressio-20) were somewhat inferior to his first three books. But I understand that the “middle books” of such an expansive series are often the least interesting. Bridges between the past and future. I am patient. When I first encountered Martin’s series I was a callow youth. I am now a father. Much has changed.

But now I read this post at *FiveThirtyEight*, [We’re Going To Learn How The ‘Game Of Thrones’ Books End On HBO](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/were-going-to-learn-how-the-game-of-thrones-books-end-on-hbo/). I haven’t much paid attention to the show because I do not watch television, and film or television of science fiction and fantasy are usually inferior and compromised products. **But the math is compelling.** I had assumed that [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20) would conclude in the early 2020s. But if the television show has nearly caught up with the books, and is already through 4 years of its run, it seems implausible that it won’t race ahead. I’m at a loss for what I can even say to this. **Is our patience and forbearance for naught?** Apparently.

I agree with the suggestion o some: the HBO series and the books should explicitly “[fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29).”
