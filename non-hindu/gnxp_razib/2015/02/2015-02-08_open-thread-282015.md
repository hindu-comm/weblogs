At 780 pages this is a substantial work, and from what I can tell it’s an academically oriented text (not one of those Kindle “books” which are cut & paste jobs out of Wikipedia). Yet strangely the [hardcover edition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581152035/geneexpressio-20) is much more expensive, at \$39.99. That’s a huge discount. Additionally, the “digital list price” is \$33.99. Is this incredible deal random? Or does Amazon know that I’m likely to buy this book at this price point? The only non-introductory population genetics text that I know of on Kindle is [Matthew Hamilton’s](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005TI32EY/geneexpressio-20), and it’s Kindle price is \$58.99, pretty steep. I generally avoid buying books which might have figures and mathematical symbols in electronic format, because they don’t always render well on a Kindle, but if the Hamilton book was cheap enough I’d go for it (I don’t have a physical copy because I’ve got all the other major population genetics textbooks already).

Also, my friend [Ryan Baldini](https://sites.google.com/site/ryanbaldini/) just put up a paper on bioRxiv that some readers might find of interest, [Harsh environments and “fast” human life histories: What does the theory say?](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/04/014647). I’ll have more comment when I’ve thoroughly read the paper.
