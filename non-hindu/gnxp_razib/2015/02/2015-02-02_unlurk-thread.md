Unlurk thread

It’s been a while since I did one of these. Sometimes people want have a thread to say a few things about themselves, as that way they can know who else they’re talking to and with. You can use a pseudo, but please don’t use “anon” or “anonymous”, since it is hard to tell people apart.
