My Goodreads, categorized

[![51FjqA33BiL.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/51FjqA33BiL._SY344_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)![51FjqA33BiL.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/51FjqA33BiL._SY344_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg?resize=200%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AXXUA7C/geneexpressio-20)A few people have mentioned that my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18982209-razib-khan) has been helpful to them. I used to find Amazon’s recommendations very useful, but lately that’s been less so, perhaps because the low hanging fruit has been picked. So manual/human curation has been more important for me of late. As an example, I really like checking out [Thomas Mailund’s profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26515583-thomas-mailund). Anyway, because of the feedback I went back last night and roughly categorized all my books. So instead of having to sift through a bunch of mediocre fantasy or science fiction, if you want to see a bunch of books on genetics that I remember reading, now just [look in that shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18982209-razib-khan?shelf=genetics).

Finally, I wanted to mention a book I hadn’t talked about much that I saw on my profile, that’s Matt Ridley’s [Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AXXUA7C/geneexpressio-20). The book is 15 years old, and so probably dated. I’m actually curious to go back and re-read it now. But it was arguably one of the major reasons I’m here now, as someone who is professionally a genome-nut. Of Ridley’s book I think it’s probably the most readable.
