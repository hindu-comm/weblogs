Eat more spice to battle weight gain?

[![1326-2T](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1326-2T-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300)![1326-2T](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1326-2T-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DG56P/geneexpressio-20)I really like spicy food. *A lot*. Though I appreciate a good habanero or ghost pepper, sometimes fresh peppers do not keep well. So I’m a bit of a connoisseur ofhot sauces. Recently I ordered two bottles of [Da Bomb, Ground Zero](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DG56P/geneexpressio-20). At \~250,000 S[coville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) units it’s spicy enough to satisfy me, but unlike the [Final Answer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BIXK7K/geneexpressio-20) it doesn’t seem positively dangerous (when I put the [Final Answer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001BIXK7K/geneexpressio-20) on a burger, I ate with gloves on). I recommend readers who trust me in this area to check this hot sauce out, it’s a really good value for the price, and though it isn’t as flavorful as milder concoctions it doesn’t taste nearly as chemical as some of the *Dave’s Insanity* line.

Because of the high amount of spice that I consume I’m always looking out for the scientific implications of the consumption. On the whole it seems like it’s a wash in terms of the results, so I focus on the hedonic utility. But [Nautilus Magazine](http://tss.nautil.us/4573) has a infographic up, [The New Superfood? Spice](http://tss.nautil.us/4573). The whole idea of a “superfood” is pretty fallacious in my opinion, but it points me to the research in question, a presentation today at the [Biophysical Society](http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=7414018f-3f3d-4983-9074-59d905670698&cKey=260298d9-0e86-472c-b48e-2bd7968621ca&mKey=50056dd1-4b44-4f4a-b685-b88d00f3529b) meeting:

I’m not much intostudies on mice, but those who know this area can tell me whether this is legit or not. As someone who is focused on burning the fat I’m quite happy that my consumption habits might be helping me stave off corpulence.
