Even though this is a sharply delimited list, beyond the top two I think there is going to be debate. As for those, I think Charles Darwin and R. A. Fisher take those stops. Darwin for developing a theory of evolution that was more than purely descriptive in its power (pre-Darwinian theories were not powerful theoretical frameworks, even if they intuited the likelihood of various evolutionary processes). Fisher, for fusing Mendelian genetics with evolutionary biology, and also for being [seminal in the creation of population genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684644/geneexpressio-20), which is arguably the most elementary system by which one can explore evolutionary processes. But below these top two I think one can go many disparate directions.

For example, [Alfred Russell Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace) was there with Darwin as a proponent of natural selection as a mechanism for Darwinian evolution. In fact he was arguably a more staunch [pan-selectionist than Darwin himself](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571223923/geneexpressio-20). Then you have the two other dominant figures in early population genetics, [Sewall Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright) and [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane). The debates between [Wright and Fisher](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/27757435?sid=21105869794873&uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4) were influential within evolutionary genetics for decades.

D. Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Hamilton) and [John Maynard Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Smith) loom very large. As in the comparison between Fisher and Haldane, I think there is a difficulty in that both Hamilton and Maynard Smith were very influential and brilliant thinkers, so choosing one seems to unintentionally diminish the other. **But for me W. D. Hamilton probably does rank as third on the list, behind Fisher and Darwin.** And many do [argue that he is their heir](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13752-014-0170-2#page-1) (in his biography [Hamilton does admit his huge debt to Fisher](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716745305/geneexpressio-20), though later on in life he also states that he began to view Sewall Wright more favorably). Contemporary with Hamilton and Maynard Smith was [George Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Williams), who made some important conceptual breakthroughs in the 1960s which paralleled Hamilton’s formal endeavors.

Because of the important of population genetics in modern evolutionary biology, I think I’m inclined argue that Wright and Haldane should be in the top five. That leaves only one slot, and I’d give that as I note above to Hamilton, another theorist. This is obviously a biased and subjective list. Others may differ, and I invite you to offer your own ideas.

On another note, despite my moderation policy the comments are beginning to become more frequent here. **If you want a response to a comment place it on an “open thread” if it is off topic.** I try and respond to queries, but I can’t keep track of it all quite a bit of the time.
