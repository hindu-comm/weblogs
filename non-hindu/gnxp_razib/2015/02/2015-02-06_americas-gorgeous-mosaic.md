America’s “gorgeous mosaic”

From the [comments](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/unlurk-thread/#comment-866506):

> I would be interested in more of your thoughts on western popular culture. Thanks for keeping up with this blog, I have learned a lot! For now, I quietly wait for a post that I can add insight to

Having lived basically my entire adult life in overwhelmingly coastal liberal US cities I’m not personally very familiar with “Red America” (though long-time readers will be aware that my adolescence was spent in the inter-Montane West, in a town not too different from what you might see in [Napoleon Dynamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Dynamite)). So I’ve become fascinated recently about what one can learn by watching [“bro-country”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro-country) videos. Compare for example the video above of [Florida Georgia Line’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Georgia_Line) *Cruise* remixed from the origin with the rapper Nelly, to the original below:

The music of the United States naturally maps onto to subcultural divisions, and seems to me to be a great way to explore the diversity. Though I’m not sure how “cross-over” productions like the above with Nelly turn out, often the values and ethos are dissonant.

If you are new to this area, this critique of “bro-country” hits many of the tropes of the genre:
