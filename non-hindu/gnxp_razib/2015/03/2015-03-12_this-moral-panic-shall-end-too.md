This moral panic shall end too

[![tnapb4](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tnapb4.jpg?resize=165%2C250)![tnapb4](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tnapb4.jpg?resize=165%2C250)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20)From *Tablet*, [Letting Go of Our Kids Isn’t a Form of Neglect](http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/189253/letting-go-of-our-kids):

> …Kidnapping by strangers is wildly uncommon; in New York State, for > instance, the Division of Criminal Justice Services announced that **20,309 children were reported missing statewide in 2011; exactly one of those children was confirmed abducted by a stranger.** Most—94 percent—were runaways, most of them teenagers.

The article is in response to the state of Maryland’s horrified response in relation to the existence of a [family which practices “free range” parenting.](http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/02/cps-decision-in-maryland-parents-case-th) Free range being what used to be called normal parenting as far back as the 1980s. Looking at the statistics above this is a clear case of [moral panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic). It will abate. Too many cultural forces, from overtaxed working mothers to libertarians and Christian parents’ rights sorts, object to the dominant ethos. But, I suspect that technology, the ubiquity of phones with GPS and tracking technology, will play a role in the changing of the *Zeitgeist*.
