I, Razib Khan

[![better](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/better-122x150.jpg?resize=122%2C150)![better](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/better-122x150.jpg?resize=122%2C150)](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/better.jpg)Due to the late unpleasantness certain images of me are floating around the web. To the left is a photo that people can use if they so choose in the future. Just click the link and a much bigger file will pop up. I am not anticipating that this will be needed, but you never know.

**P.S.** Example, [Ebony](http://www.ebony.com/black-listed/news-views/razib-khan-let-go-by-new-york-times-981) didnâ€™t ask for permission to use this photo, which is my own (can be found at a lab website).
