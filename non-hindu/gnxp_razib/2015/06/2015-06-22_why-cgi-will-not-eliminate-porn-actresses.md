Why CGI will not eliminate porn actresses

[![4146cuHZENL.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4146cuHZENL._SY344_BO1204203200_-202x300.jpg?resize=202%2C300)![4146cuHZENL.\_SY344_BO1,204,203,200\_](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4146cuHZENL._SY344_BO1204203200_-202x300.jpg?resize=202%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393340007/geneexpressio-20)Strange as it may be to say this, but the film [San Andreas](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00YGO1FQE/geneexpressio-20) made me reflect on the nature of particular service sector professions, and their future, recently. It was typical for its genre. Very little plot or characterization (less than a week out I’m still vague on these aspects), and a lot of [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery). A lot.[Dwayne Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson) plays the father of [Alexandra Daddario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Daddario), with [Carla Gugino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Gugino) plausibly cast as the mother. In fact, Daddario resembles Gugino enough that you might wonder about the possibility of [genomic imprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting). **But the real star was the CGI**.

[![Alexandra_Daddario_April_2015](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Alexandra_Daddario_April_2015-107x150.jpg?resize=107%2C150)![Alexandra_Daddario_April_2015](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Alexandra_Daddario_April_2015-107x150.jpg?resize=107%2C150)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Daddario#/media/File:Alexandra_Daddario_April_2015.jpg)And the effects overwhelmed the acting so much that it madewonder again when actors will become totally dispensable. The “comic book movie” genre is already known for being driven more by special effects and the [characters](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-3-different-actors-have-to-play-the-Hulk) than the actors who play them (with the notable exception of Robert Downey Jr.). Which brings me toporn. Recently a controversial documentary came out, [Hot Girls Wanted](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/13/hot-girls-wanted-is-pornsploitation.html), about a group of young women living a house and trying to break into the industry (the controversy is not the porn, but rather how the women and the industry were depicted). One event in the film is that[one of the actresses quits because of family pressure](http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/04/hot-girls-wanted). It has to be admitted thatIn relation to porn **many men are quite happy for it to be around, but would be aghast if any women in their personal social network participated in the industry**. So perhaps**CGI the answer to this tension?** Once you have CGI good enough to simulate real actors, it would be pretty easy to apply to pornography. And porn has some major [downsides](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hiv-scare-in-porn-industry-after-2-actors-test-positive/) which would be obviated by CGI “performers.”

But it wouldn’t be so easy, and that is because demand for flesh & blood performers will always be there.In [How Pleasure Works](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393340007/geneexpressio-20) Paul Bloom teases out the implications ofthe latest cognitive psychology in this domain, making extensive recourse to concepts such as “[aliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alief_(mental_state)).” The easiest way for me to illustrate what an alief is is to give an example. Imagine that you see someone use the raw ingredients of fudge brownies to construct the simulacrumof feces. You know for a fact that the*faux*-feces are not feces, and in fact are delicious fudge brownies…which happen to look like feces. Your beliefs about this are informed by copious facts at hand. But many individuals would nevertheless exhibit difficulty and aversion in consuming these*faux*-feces. Deep in your bones are concepts and ideas about entities which inform how you react to them. In simple “objective” hedonic units of sensory *qualia* a \$200 dollar wine may not be superior to a \$10 wine, but the knowledge that the \$200 wine is expensive, rare, and from France (as opposed to California or Australia for the \$10 wine), **can actually impact how you experience the taste**.

And this fact about human nature is probably why we pay so much for “artisanal.” Artisanal isn’t necessarily better in a reductionist sense that Jeremy Bentham would recognize. But people appreciate the products better because of their history of production, and who made them. **In short, a service isn’t just about*what*, it’s about*who.*****Which brings me back to porn. At some point in the very near future software will get good enough to mass produce pornography where the performers are virtual. Likely these performers will be produced “on the fly” by consumer preferences (e.g., there almost certainly is someone out there who prefers blonde Asian females with small breasts and large buttocks). In terms of raw dimensions, and flawlessness of skin, they will blow real actresses out of the water. But one of the appeals of “amateur porn” for many consumers is*who* the performers are. That means there will be a demand for “real” porn by “real” women. **Artisanally produced porn**, not the faceless (in a metaphorical sense) output from a well tuned algorithm. Of course the CGI can simulate the more rough and natural “artisinal” look, so there will be authenticating agencies or firms so that consumers know that these girls are actually “real amateurs.”

This line of argument could apply to many service sector activities. In the near to medium term future it seems plausible that the bottom 90% of the population will be employed in occupations which serve the demand of the top 10% for “authentic” human servility and handcrafts.
