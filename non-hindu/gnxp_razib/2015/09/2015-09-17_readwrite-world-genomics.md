Read/write world genomics?

I have a post up at the new GSA blog, [Read/write access to your genomes? Using the past to jump to the future](http://genestogenomes.org/readwrite-access-to-your-genomes-using-the-past-to-jump-to-the-future/). One thing I would say: **I didn’t get into human germline modification because I don’t think it’s going to be a major issue in the near term.** And, I think it’s more of a bioethical aspect of the technology of genetic engineering than a scientific one. I’m pretty sure we’ll have the technology, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. Also, special thanks to Yaniv Erhlic for writing [A vision for ubiquitous sequencing](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/22/019018). It really has gotten me thinking….
