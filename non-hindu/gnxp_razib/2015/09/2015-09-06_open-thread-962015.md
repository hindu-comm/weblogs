So I bought it. [Alexander to Actium](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00UJ7RAY8/geneexpressio-20) is pretty far back in my history, so it seems appropriate to “catch-up” on the genesis of the Hellenistic era. But right now I’m back to [A New History of Western Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ARGXJM8/geneexpressio-20), which has been slow going…. I think part of the issue here is that it is always a slog to work your way through ideas which I feel are not relevant in any direct fashion today, but are of interest as intellectual history and backdrop. And I haven’t even gotten to [The Shape of Ancient Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20) and [Warriors of the Cloisters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0091XC09G/geneexpressio-20).

This pre-print, [Analyses of Eurasian wild and domestic pig genomes reveals long-term gene-flow during domestication](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/10/31/010959), has now been published. It’s pretty interesting, as it suggests the complexity of animal domestication. Contrast this with how clear the process is in [plants](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2015/05/04/genetics.115.175752).

In other news, check out the [demographics of those admitted to Harvard](http://features.thecrimson.com/2015/freshman-survey/) this year.
