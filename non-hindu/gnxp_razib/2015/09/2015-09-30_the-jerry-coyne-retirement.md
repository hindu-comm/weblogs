The Jerry Coyne retirement

[![speciation](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speciation.png?resize=234%2C284)![speciation](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speciation.png?resize=234%2C284)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878930892/geneexpressio-20)[Jerry Coyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Coyne), an eminent [evolutionary geneticist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iME3jMYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and all around [public intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Coyne#Atheism), is retiring, and has [posted a bittersweet *and* hopeful farewell letter](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/09/30/i-retire-today) to his conventional scientific career. For the general public Coyne is probably more famous as a New Atheist, though Coyne is actually a vocal atheist of long standing. His most recent book was on that topic, *Faith Versus Fact: Why Science and Religion Are Incompatible*. I’m an atheist, but on the balance I demur form many of his positions in regards to religion and science. More precisely, I am quite willing to defend atheism and dismiss religion, but on philosophical or meta-scientific grounds, not scientific grounds as such.

When it comes to science on the whole I tend to agree with Coyne more often than not. In particular, his attitude toward the dynamics driving evolutionary process. In regards to the science, this section jumped out at me:

> What I’m proudest of, I suppose, is the book I wrote with my > ex-student Allen Orr, > [Speciation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878930892/geneexpressio-20), > published in 2004. It took each of us six years to write, was widely > acclaimed and, more important, was influential. I still see that book as my true legacy, for it not only summed up where the field had gone, but also highlighted its important but unsolved questions, serving as a guide for future research.

As readers know I read [Speciation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878930892/geneexpressio-20) in 2005, and it has really influenced my perspective on the broader topic. It’s an ambitious book even if the focus is on the process of speciation, rather like [Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IVHCTOY/geneexpressio-20) in spirit, though far more economical in terms of prose and clearer in execution. I don’t know if [Speciation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00IVHCTOY/geneexpressio-20) is out of date or not, as I don’t study speciation, but I’d recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how an evolutionary geneticist might view the process and concept.
