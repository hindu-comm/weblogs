Update 2

From time to time I look through my old posts to see if any of them are still worth reading.

I gave a guide to the earliest ones [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002125.html) and an update in October 2004 [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002815.html).

I think the following posts since October may still be of interest:

[Dawkins on Kin Selection](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002882.html) summarises and comments on Richard Dawkins’s often-cited but seldom-read paper ‘12 misunderstandings of kin selection’.

Continuing the theme of kin selection, [It’s a Ring Thing](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003268.html) explores how to measure coefficients of relationship in cases where the parties are related and/or inbred, using Wagner’s Siegfried and Brünnhilde as an illustration.

[Limits to Hamilton’s Rule](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003410.html) warns that W. D. Hamilton’s theory of inclusive fitness is seldom useful unless the organisms concerned are very closely related.

[The X Chromosome Waltz](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003004.html) explores exactly what is meant by saying that an X chromosome spends twice as long in female bodies as in male ones. (A note in that post proved that the limit of the sum 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 + 4/16 + 5/32.…. is 2. It was pointed out in comments that there is a simpler proof using elementary calculus.) A related post, [X Chromosome Evolution](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003212.html), analyses the evolution of genes on an X chromosome which increase fitness when they occur in one sex while reducing fitness in the other, which has been suggested as a possible cause of homosexuality.

A cluster of posts earlier this year examined Frank Salter’s theory of ethnic genetic interests. [Interracial marriage: Salter’s Fallacy](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003447.html) identified what in my view is a fallacious argument Salter uses against interracial marriage. [Ethnic Genetic Interests](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003501.html) is a more general criticism of Salter’s theories. I emphasise that Salter himself does not put his theories forward as a scientific explanation of behaviour, but as a political proposal for how people should behave if they wish to recognise their ’ethnic genetic interests’. I do not see any reason why they should. A further post, [Ethnic Genetic Interests: Part 2](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003504.html), contains some more technical criticisms.

As I have often been sceptical about group selection, I felt honour-bound to describe an apparently neglected paper I had found, which sets out a model in which group selection can work, though in a fairly narrow range of circumstances. I did this in a post [Group Selection can work…just](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003540.html).

[British or English?](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003560.html) discusses the rather confusing issues of national identity and nomenclature within the British Isles. I subsequently ([here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003573.html)) corrected the statement that ‘about half of the population of Wales speak Welsh‘, as it was pointed out in comments that this was too high.

More recently there is a cluster of posts on various aspects of ethnic groups in Britain: [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/0035657.html) on crime; [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003749.html), [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003772.html) and [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003790.html) on education; and [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003835.html) on inter-ethnic marriage. Not much theory, but plenty of facts and figures, for those who like that kind of thing.
