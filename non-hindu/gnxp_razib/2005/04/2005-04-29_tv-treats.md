TV treats

For UK readers, Channel 4 TV has a few programmes of interest in the coming week:

Monday 9.00 p.m.: Riddle of the Human Hobbits: an Equinox special.

Monday 11.05 p.m.: Dr Tatiana’s Sex Guide To All Creation (part 1)

Tuesday 11.10 p.m.: Dr Tatiana’s Sex Guide To All Creation (part 2)

Wednesday 11.05 p.m.: Dr Tatiana’s Sex Guide To All Creation (part 3)

The Dr Tatiana programmes are presented by Dr Tatiana herself, aka Dr Olivia Judson. Among other treats, she is seen crawling around a forest in California looking for banana slugs which keep their penises behind their ears. (Do slugs actually have ears??)

Oh, and for Wagnerians, BBC2 next Saturday (May 7) has Acts 2 and 3 of Die Walküre, provided Bryn Terfel hasn’t lost his voice again.

Added

Of course, I can’t vouch that the programmes will be any good. The Evening Standard preview gives the Dr Tatiana series 4 stars out of 5, but today’s Times describes it as ‘totally unwatchable’. The one certainty is that Olivia Judson wears a white mini-skirt.
