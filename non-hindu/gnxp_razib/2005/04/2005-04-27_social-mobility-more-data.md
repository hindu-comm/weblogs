Social Mobility: more data

I found another source of international comparisons of social mobility [here](https://www.tcf.org/Publications/EconomicsInequality/ragrichrc.pdf). I wouldn’t pay much attention to the analysis, which is superficial, but the data are relevant.

Discussion on my earlier post reminded me of Paul Fussell’s amusing book [Class: Style and Status in the USA](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671792253/ref=ase_geneexpressio-20/102-3972032-6983341?v=glance&s=books) (1983). Fussell divides the American population into nine classes:

Top out-of-sight  
Upper  
Upper middle

Middle  
High proletarian  
Mid-proletarian  
Low proletarian

Destitute  
Bottom out-of-sight

The top and bottom classes are ‘out of sight’ for different reasons: the top because they want to keep away from envious prying eyes, and the bottom because they are mainly in institutions.
