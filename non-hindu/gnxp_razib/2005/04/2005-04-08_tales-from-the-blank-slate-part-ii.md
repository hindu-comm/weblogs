Tales from the blank slate – Part II

Striking another body blow against Discrimination, the Swedish government has now decided to [ban all gender-based differential pricing](http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,628331,00.html). Women will have to pay full price for a number of services, such as Taxi rides, and will no longer be let into nightclubs at earlier ages than males.

Males will on the other hand no longer be able to enjoy cut-rate haircuts. Take that patriarchy!

This bold initiative comes shortly after the latest government equality push, aimed at making it harder for women to stay at home with their children. (Essentially, unless you split parental leave 50-50, you will be punished financially)

TangoMan Adds: Let’s not overlook the [recent turn of events](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/05/norway.women.reut/) in Norway where the government will dissolve a company that doesn’t have women comprising 40% of its Board of Directors.
