The Comparative Advantage of the US

In the comments section to Arcane’s post on [Humans, Neanderthals, and Free Trade](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003861.html) there is a debate focused on comparative advantage and free trade. I thought it would be helpful to inject some actual data into the mix so I pulled up this 15% finished post (basically just working data) that I just lost interest in finishing (I’ve got a lot of these types of posts cluttering up my computer) and thought I’d offer it here, with a “No-Satisfaction Guarantee” sticker slapped on it. Here’s some raw data on US trade practices with no conclusions attached. Make of the data what you will.

Enjoy or ignore.

US Comparative Advantages

[Here](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2002pr/Final_Revisions_2002/exh14tl.pdf) is the “EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF GOODS BY PRINCIPAL SITC COMMODITY GROUPINGS – 2002 DATA”

In 2002, the US exported \$682 Billion in products and \$292 Billion in services. In the same year it imported \$1,165 Billion in products and \$227 Billion in services. [Source.](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2002pr/Final_Revisions_2002/exh1.pdf)

Breaking down the EXPORT in services we find that Travel accounted for \$66.5 Billion, Passenger Fares for \$17 Billion, Other Transportation for \$29.2 Billion, Royalties & License Fees for \$44.1 Billion, Other Private Services for \$122.6 Billion, Transfer Under US Military Sales Contracts for \$11.9 Billion, and US GOv’t Misc. Services for \$0.8 Billion. [Source.](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2002pr/Final_Revisions_2002/exh2.pdf)

Breaking down the IMPORT in services we find that Travel accounted for \$58 Billion, Passenger Fares for \$20 Billion, Other Transportation for \$38.5 Billion, Royalties & License Fees for \$19.3 Billion, Other Private Services for \$69.4 Billion, Direct Defense Expenditures for \$19.2 Billion, and US GOv’t Misc. Services for \$2.9 Billion. [Source.](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2002pr/Final_Revisions_2002/exh3.pdf)

Our \$65 Billion trade surplus in services is accounted for by two categories: license fees and other private services.
