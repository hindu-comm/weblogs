Surprising results from the new Pew poll‚Ä¶

Here are some of the more surprising of the results from the latest Pew Research Center poll, ‚Äú[Beyond Red vs. Blue](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=242).‚Äù

First of all, lets start off with the categories that the poll divided people into. You can find more info about each of these categories by [following this link](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=949).

Here are the results of whom each group is most likely to vote for:

‚Ä¶ and the centrists generally lean toward the GOP side of the isle:

Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, time to get to the good stuff.

First, in direct contradiction to polls released last year, the report states that‚Ä¶

Enterprisers \[Bush‚Äôs strongest supporters\] follow news about government and politics more closely than any other group, and exhibit the most knowledge about world affairs. The Fox News Channel is their primary source of news (46% cite it as a main source)‚Ä¶

Most Americans support tort reform:

Most Americans have no problems with trade:

‚Ä¶ but they do have a problem with outsourcing:

A slight majority of Americans have no problems with guest workers, with the most opposition on the Democratic side of the isle:

The majority of Americans, and Republicans, support universal health insurance in some form:

The vast majority of Americans think that displaying the Ten Commandments on government buildings is ‚Äúproper‚Äù:

![commandments.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/commandments.jpg?resize=322%2C315)![commandments.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/commandments.jpg?resize=322%2C315)

Bush‚Äôs strongest supporters, the Enterprisers, are the least likely of Republicans to attend Bible study or prayer meetings:

The vast majority of Americans think that preemptive military action can be justified:

Americans as a whole are generally tolerant of Christian conservatives and Muslims. Interestingly enough, Liberals have a much, much, much stronger opinion of Muslims than they do of Christian conservatives:

Finally, and perhaps most disturbing of all, the vast majority of Americans support teaching creationism alongside evolution in schools:

So, this is very interesting and surprising data. I strongly recommend that everyone should read the report or look at [the stances of the voting blocks on the various issues](http://typology.people-press.org/data/index.php?GroupID=3). There‚Äôs a lot more interesting stuff in the report than just the stuff I posted here, although it was weak on many areas, such as on issues concerning immigration. I also highly recommend looking at the [principle findings](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=943).

Also, take their [typology test](http://typology.people-press.org/typology/) and see where you stand‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm an [Enterpriser](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=949#enterprisers), in case anyone cares. üôÇ
