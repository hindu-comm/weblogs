Chess of a different kind

[On Boards Without Boys, Girls Reassert Their Power](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/national/16chess.html?hp=&pagewanted=all), a heart-warming tale of female chessies which simultaneously disapproves of stereotypes and plays them up for dramatic effect. Now, the gist of the story seems to be that a certain group (girls) should be encouraged to keep at it in chess, and that this competition-of-their-own is a project aimed toward that goal.

But, looking at a [list of winners from last year](http://www.kasparovchessfoundation.org/Press_Releases/05_19_04.html), and I wonder if perhaps there shouldn’t be outreach toward more gentile non-Slavs if decent proportionality is so important.
