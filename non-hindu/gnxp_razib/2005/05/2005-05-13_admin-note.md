Admin note

To GNXP account holders, please do not post anything until further notice. The webhost changed some settings and I need to re-edit some custom-coded config files, otherwise, the rebuilds throw up an error page.

Updated: OK, I fixed the problem. FYI my webhost has increased security, but in the process constrained some of my work-arounds. But, if you have a problem (particulary a 500-level type error), feel free to email me.
