$5000 Genome Sequencing

Randall Parker has an interesting [post](http://www.futurepundit.com/) on “\$5000 DNA Sequencing By 2007”.

The Haplotype Map shows SNP’s shared by many people. Whole genome sequencing will show SNP’s that are unique to individuals. The entire human population could be viewed as an experiment to understand how genes influence outcome in different environments. Gene function is often tested by inducing mutations in yeast or fruit flies and then observing the affect. Naturally occurring mutations would allow the same discovery process using the human populace.
