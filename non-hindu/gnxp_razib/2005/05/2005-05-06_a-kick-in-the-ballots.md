A Kick In The Ballots

I can’t resist repeating the headline from this morning’s Sun!

Tony B. Liar has been re-elected, but with a sharply reduced majority. With most results now announced, the Labour majority in Parliament has been cut from around 180 to only about 60 – and many of the Labour MPs hate Tony even more than the Opposition.

Both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have gained seats. The result is better for the Conservatives than the polls had predicted.

In a revolt against political correctness, a Labour candidate selected from a women-only shortlist in a Welsh constituency has been defeated by a popular local Labour man standing as an Independent. The national Labour Party machine thought their majority in the constituency was so large that they could impose an unwanted female candidate on the local party and get away with it. Wrong!

The bad news is that Ghastly George Galloway, Saddam’s buddy, has been elected by a heavily-Muslim electorate in Bethnal Green, defeating Oona King, the Black-Jewish former Labour MP.
