More selection on mtDNA

[Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup K is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease in Italians](http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ejhg/journal/v13/n6/abs/5201425a.html):

It has been proposed that European mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups J and K, and their shared 10398G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ND3 gene, are protective from Parkinson’s disease (PD)…However, the frequency of haplogroup K was significantly lower in PD. Stratification by sex and age indicated that the difference in the distribution of haplogroup K was more prominent in \>50year old males. In spite of the common 10398G SNP, haplogroups J and K belong to widely diverging mitochondrial clades, a consideration that may explain the different results obtained for the two haplogroups in our cohorts. Our study suggests that haplogroup K might confer a lower risk for PD in Italians, corroborating the idea that the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway is involved in the susceptibility to idiopathic PD.

Of course Parkinson’s disease effects the old so selection pressure probably isn’t that great (though older family members can have fitness effects down the generations).
