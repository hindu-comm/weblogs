Logo

Will leave this new one up for about a day. Say yay or nay in the comments.

Update: If you think you have a cool logo design for gnxp’s header, email it to me at contactgnxp – at – gmail.com. Small images with transparent backgrounds preferred (so a GIF). Will take submissions for a few weeks.

Update II: Changed it back. Send me new logos if you want though. Might test them out.
