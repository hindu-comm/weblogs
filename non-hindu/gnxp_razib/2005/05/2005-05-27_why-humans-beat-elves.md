Why humans beat elves

In [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031100/qid%3D1117155911/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5Fb%5F2%5F1/102-3972032-6983341) Armand Leroi reviewed the [antagonistic pleiotropy](http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/evolution.html) theory of aging. Of course, anyone who reads fantasy books would understand this intuitively, no matter how primo Elf traits are (long life, superhuman vision or agility, magical powers, etc.) short-lived humans are always more numerous and dominant because of their fast reproductive cycles.
