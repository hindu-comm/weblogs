An evolutionary education

RMP over at [EvolGen](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/) is starting a series called [Detecting Natural Selection](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/11/detecting-natural-selection_20.html). I know a substantial subset of readers donâ€™t come out of a science background, so I think some might find it of interest. The [first entry is up](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/11/detecting-natural-selection-part-1.html), if anything is a surprise, read the whole thing (eventually).
