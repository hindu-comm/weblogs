Minor notes

For some time now I’ve been telling people that [John Hawks](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog/) is making other evobloggers look bad. Frankly, I am tempted to link to every other post over on his weblog. Well, I won’t be linking to his posts unless there is a non-trivial amount of commentary from this moment on, look to the right and you will notice that I am now displaying his [RSS feed](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog/index.rss) (Update: scripts are having issues, so I turned the feeds off for now).

On another matter, the [dynamic duo](http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/1478/) have another paper out, [Genetic diversity and genetic burden in humans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16246638&query_hl=1).

Additionally, I’m noticing an uptick in people [buying books](https://www.gnxp.com/#books), probably for the X-mas season. Remember that GNXP is an Amazon Associate, so if you go through our site to buy something we get a cut. Last X-mas someone bought a computer!

Finally, people often email me links to papers. I really appreciate that, but, if you wouldn’t mind, you might also “cc” your find into the [gnxp forum](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnxpforum/). I don’t have time to comment on or link to every submission, but a lot of the papers are interesting. You might find something else of interest in the forum in the process.
