Ancient and Recent Positive Selection Transformed Opioid cis-Regulation in Humans

[Ancient and Recent Positive Selection Transformed Opioid *cis*-Regulation in Humans](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030387#JOURNAL-PBIO-0030387-G001):

> â€¦In addition, the pattern of linked nucleotide and microsatellite > variation among and within modern human populations suggests that recent selection, subsequent to the fixation of the human-specific mutations and the peopling of the globe, has favored different prodynorphin cis-regulatory alleles in different parts of the world.

John Hawks has [detailed commentary](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/brain/pdyn_evolution_2005.html). Some info on [cis and trans regulation](http://cats.med.uvm.edu/cats_teachingmod/microbiology/courses/gene_regulation/euk_regulation/4.2.GRG.HUB.DNAELEM.HTML).
