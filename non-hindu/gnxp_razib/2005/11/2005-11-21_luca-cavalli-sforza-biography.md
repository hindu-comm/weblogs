Luca Cavalli-Sforza biography

I just found out recently that a biography of [Luca Cavalli-Sforza](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Luigi_Cavalli-Sforza/) was published this spring, [A Genetic and Cultural Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231133960/geneexpressio-20/). I’ll probably be reading it over the Thanksgiving weekend, but I thought I’d give people a heads up around here since I suspect I’m not the only fan. [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20/) is one of those seminal works which has really shaped the intellectual path I have taken. Over the years I have become progressively more skeptical about reading history from alleles frequencies, but Cavalli-Sforza’s work is an interdisciplinary inspiration to this day. If a readable genetic monograph is your cup of tea, I also recommend [Consanguinity, Inbreeding, and Genetic Drift in Italy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691089914/geneexpressio-20/). I picked it up a few years in Barnes & Noble in New York, and read most of it on the airplane. The frequency of aunt-nephew marriages in Sicily will make you wonder! Finally, [Genetics of Human Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20/) is back in print, though the text isn’t updated a lot of the population genetic models are becoming extremely relevant again to deal with the swarms of data that are the norm in the post-genomic era.
