Yahyaism spreading to National Review?

I was a bit taken aback by seeing [Yahayist](http://www.harunyahya.com/) Mustafa Akyol [published at National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/akyol200512010817.asp) Online. While NRO is frequently predictable and hackish, they are rarely outright nutty. Akyol even holds up [the infamous “Wedge Document”](http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html) as a great achievement of the Intelligent Design movement:

> That’s why something called the Wedge Document, although horrifying to > America’s secularist intelligentsia, offers a message of hope for > Muslims. The Wedge Document is a 1999 memorandum of the Discovery > Institute (DI), the Seattle-based think tank that acts as the main proponent of ID. In this document, the Institute explains that its long-term goal is “to defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural, and political legacies.”

Is this merely a case of throwing some red meat to the Evangelicals, lest they feel forgotten by the [metrocons](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire050803.asp) at NRO? If so, someone has decided that one batch of meat wasn’t enough. Today, National Review serves up [a real whooper](http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/bethell200512010829.asp) by one Tom Bethell. Here is a sample:

> We are expected to believe – and I do mean believe – that evolution > answers the important question: How did life, in all its abundance, > appear on Earth? By the slow, successive modification of pre-existing forms, Darwin said. Go back far enough, to one of those warm little ponds Darwinians assume must have existed, and we would find that life started of its own accord from nothing in particular.

This man has written a book – on science, no less. [No, really](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/089526031X/geneexpressio-20/).
