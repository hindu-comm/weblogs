Books for the New Year

What books are you going to be reading as 2006 unfolds? I suspect most of us are always behind and short of time, but I am curious as to what has caught the attention of GNXP readers. I’ll be working my way through Will Provine’s [The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684636/geneexpressio-20/), somewhat parochial of course, but that’s why I’m asking what you’ll be reading….
