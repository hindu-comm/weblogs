Fun with math

My math is a little rusty, but I wanted to offer a little statistical observation relating to ID and being dumb.

Let…  
ID = believe in ID  
dumb = are dumb

Prior for being dumb: talented tenth (or if you have a certain someone in mind, fill in your own prior)  
P(dumb) = 0.9  
P(\~dumb) = 0.1

Likelihood of believing in ID given you are dumb (or not dumb): I made these values up, but we could probably find survey data to refine those estimates. Try your own guess.  
P(ID\|dumb) = 0.8  
P(ID\|\~dumb) = 0.4

[Bayes rule](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayesrule.html)…  
P(dumb\|ID) = 0.947  
P(dumb\|\~ID) = 0.750 \[correction\]
