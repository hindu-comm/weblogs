Bigger is better

[Sandra Witelson](http://www.fhs.mcmaster.ca/psychiatryneuroscience/faculty/witelson/) (who examined [Albert Einstein’s brain](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-brainsex16jun16,0,5806592,full.story)), et al., have a [paper](http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/awh696v1) in Brain which reports on their study on intelligence and brain size in 100 postmortem brains. They conclude that bigger is indeed better; however, they found differences between men and women.

From [EurekaAlert](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-12/mu-bbs122205.php):

> In women, verbal intelligence was clearly correlated with brain size, accounting for 36 percent of the verbal IQ score. In men, this was true for right-handers only, indicating that brain asymmetry is a factor in men. >
> Spatial intelligence was also correlated with brain size in women, but > less strongly. In men, spatial ability was not related to overall brain size. These results suggest that women may use verbal strategies in spatial thinking, but that in men, verbal and spatial thinking are more distinct….

Furthermore, from the journal [abstract](http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/awh696v1):

> We report the results of such a study on 100 cases (58 women and 42 > men) having prospectively obtained Full Scale Wechsler Adult > Intelligence Scale scores. Ability correlated with cerebral volume, > but the relationship depended on the realm of intelligence studied, as > well as the sex and hemispheric functional lateralization of the > subject. General verbal ability was positively correlated with > cerebral volume and each hemisphere’s volume in women and in > right-handed men accounting for 36% of the variation in verbal > intelligence. There was no evidence of such a relationship in > non-right-handed men, indicating that at least for verbal > intelligence, functional asymmetry may be a relevant factor in > structure-function relationships in men, but not in women. In women, > general visuospatial ability was also positively correlated with > cerebral volume, but less strongly, accounting for 10% of the > variance. In men, there was a non-significant trend of a negative > correlation between visuospatial ability and cerebral volume, > suggesting that the neural substrate of visuospatial ability may > differ between the sexes. Analyses of additional research subjects > used as test cases provided support for our regression models. In men, > visuospatial ability and cerebral volume were strongly linked via the > factor of chronological age, suggesting that the well-documented > decline in visuospatial intelligence with age is related, at least in > right-handed men, to the decrease in cerebral volume with age. We > found that cerebral volume decreased only minimally with age in women. > This leaves unknown the neural substrate underlying the visuospatial > decline with age in women. **Body height was found to account for 1-4% of the variation in cerebral volume within each sex, leaving the basis of the well-documented sex difference in cerebral volume unaccounted for.**
