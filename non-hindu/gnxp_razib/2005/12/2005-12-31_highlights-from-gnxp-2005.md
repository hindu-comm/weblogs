Highlights from 'GNXP 2005'

Well, 2005 certainly proved to be a compelling year here at GNXP. From the Larry Summers “scandal” to Ashkenazi intelligence “overclocking” and on to Bruce Lahn’s research — the year was definitely not a dull one!

Below the fold are some highlights from ‘GNXP 2005’ — this collection is by no means comprehensive — and, no doubt, I’ve left out some really great posts. But, we were spoiled for choice this year and it was difficult to narrow this list down as much as I did. Enjoy! — and see you in 2006.
