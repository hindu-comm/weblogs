Coyne on ID

Jerry Coyne is a [very long piece](http://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20050822&s=coyne082205) in The New Republic on the “controversy” between Intelligent Design and evolutionary theory. Might be worth it to forward the link to someone who isn’t in the know. [Anthony Perez-Miller](http://www.andunie.net/mt-archives/000848.php) and [John Hawks](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/creation/kansas_minority_report_2005.html) also comment on this topic. [Carl Zimmer](http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/08/11/a_dog_and_the_mind_of_newton.php) sets the record straight about Darwin’s attitude (or lack of) toward religion.
