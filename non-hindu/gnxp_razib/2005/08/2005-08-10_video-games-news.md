Video Games News

Posting has been a bit slow lately, so here’s a bit of fluff news – [Grand Theft Auto’s Maker Patches Against Unsanctioned Sex.](http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=168600520) I love the next line in the article – the world’s “least-downloaded patch ever.” Yeah, I can’t imagine too many of the people who downloaded the mod to unleash the sex graphics in the game are too keen on removing the mod.

Also, this video promo [“Addiction”](http://media.pc.ign.com/media/620/620513/vids_1.html) for Civilization IV is hilarious as is the website it promotes at the end, [CivAnon.org](http://www.civanon.org/members.shtml)
