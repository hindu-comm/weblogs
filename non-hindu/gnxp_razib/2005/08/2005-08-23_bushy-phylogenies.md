Bushy phylogenies….

A [new report](https://msnbc.msn.com/id/9045004/) is coming out of Dmanisi, Georgia, about a 1.8 million “Homo erectus” skull. This is a site that has generated a lot of buzz in the past few years, mostly because it is evidence that pre-moderns ventured into northern Eurasia very soon after their emergence in Africa. Here is a map from [talk.origins](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html#timeline) which places it in perspective:

\~1.8 million years ago there were many Homo and homo-like species hanging around on the scene. Remember those popular T-shirts which showed a linear sequence of species? Well, I’m not saying that modern humans are hybridized from branches of the bush (see here though on what [might have happened](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003944.html)). John Hawks [scooped a press](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/lower/dmanisi/dmanisi_discovery_2005.html) a few weeks ago (and knows more about this topic, obviously).
