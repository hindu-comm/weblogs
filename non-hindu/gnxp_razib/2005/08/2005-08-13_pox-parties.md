Pox Parties

Upon hearing the glorious news that little Susie’s schoolmate is infected with pox some parents, taking their vaccine phobia a bit too far, hustle their kid out to the SUV and make a beeline to the pox-infected home so Susie can attend, and be infected at, a Pox Party.

The revival of this practice is gaining ground and proves the old adage that a little knowledge is dangerous. However, some parents are all [ga-ga](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/g/archive/2004/01/29/chxpox.DTL&type=printable) over this trend:

> When she was 7 years old, San Francisco resident Eos de Feminis > remembers, she attended an out-of-the-ordinary slumber party. “It was > unusual, because we lived across the street from them, so we normally > wouldn’t spend the night,” recalls de Feminis, 36. More notable was > the fact that at least one of the kids at the party had broken out > with itchy, red sores, and De Feminis was there to deliberately get > infected, too. . . >
> “My memories of being sick as a child are actually quite pleasant,” > Volpe recalls. “I got to sleep in my parent’s bed during the day and > eat special food and get my forehead stroked.” Not that the experience > will necessarily be so painless for her 3-year-old daughter, she > admits, acknowledging the discomfort and itchiness characteristic of > chicken pox, though she adds, “Personally, I would love a reason to > take a week off from work and stay home with my daughter.”

Here’s the [medical warning](http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/2004/09_23/what_tell_patients_17.html) against Pox Parties:

> The belief out there is to have a chicken pox party to get it over > with,” says Dr Grenier. But parents rarely realize that their kids can > get severe complications from the infection. The disease can also > reactivate later in life in the form of shingles. Dr Grenier suggests > you tell parents that chicken pox isn’t a mild disease. According to > her, in Canada there’s an average of 5.8 deaths due to chicken pox > every year. Chicken pox can cause serious inflammation that destroys > joints and even encephalitis. The vaccine doesn’t prevent all kids > from catching it â€” about 90% of individuals are protected. Those > that do contract it, however, suffer only minor symptoms. New research > also points to evidence that the vaccine is a cost effective step in > the right direction. A study published in the September issue of > Pediatrics showed that since the vaccine was introduced in the US in > 1995, the healthcare system has saved close to \$100 million US due to > fewer complications and hospitalizations.
