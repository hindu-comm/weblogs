Gene expression matters, part n….

[Variation in gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers](http://physiolgenomics.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/00080.2005v1):

> In the study described here, microarrays were employed to analyse gene > transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells prepared from > serial blood samples that had been obtained, at weekly intervals, from > apparently healthy human volunteers. Transcript levels for the > majority of genes examined were found to be remarkably consistent > within samples from a single donor. **Conversely, marked differences > were observed in samples obtained from different donors**. Genes that > exhibited differential expression dependent on sex, age, body mass > index and the presence of varying proportions of different leucocyte > subsets were identified. These results emphasise the important > contributions of genetic and environmental factors, as well as varying > representation of different cell types, in determining the overall > gene transcriptional profiles of human tissues….

[SNPs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=snp), [microsatellites](http://www.amonline.net.au/evolutionary_biology/tour/microsatellites.htm) and [epigenetics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/not-genes-and-not-environment.php), we truly are living in the biological age of [assume-the-cow-is-a-sphere](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=assume+the+cow+is+a+sphere&btnG=Google+Search)…but the sphere is puckering and evincing some more interesting morphological features of late. Here is the [press release](http://www.ifr.ac.uk/Media/NewsReleases/gene_expression.html) by the researchers who were involved in the study, while this [article](http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/news-ng.asp?n=61672-study-links-diet) emphasizes the ramifications as regards nutrition and individually tailored diets.
