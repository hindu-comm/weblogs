Cutting Edge of Education Research

We generally like to add original commentary to our posts but occasionally we run into posts on other blogs that sum up the sitution perfectly, so without furthr ado here is the [Instructivist’s](https://instructivist.blogspot.com/2005/08/ed-phd.html) take on what is needed to get a Ph.D in Education:

> Racial and Gender Identity Development in White Male  
> Multicultural Educators and Facilitators:  
> Toward Individual Processes of Self-development >

> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE >
> Background >
> I am a white male multicultural awareness facilitator. As such, I > facilitate activities and discussions focused on multicultural issues > and identifiers including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, > socioeconomic class, ability status, and religion. In these forums, I > request that individuals describe from their personal experience what > it means to be “female,” “Jewish,” “Latino,” or other identification > descriptors. It is through facilitating the exchange of these > experiences and perspectives and advocating for the introspective process of exploring them that I work to build an atmosphere conducive to introspection, self-development, and increased awareness of a discussion’s participants.

It seems that Gorski has taken this schtick and actually published some textbooks on Multicultural Education, [here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0073011436/qid=1124308611/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-0337987-6624700?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0810620057/qid=1124308611/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/104-0337987-6624700?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).

I weep silent tears for the state of our schools.
