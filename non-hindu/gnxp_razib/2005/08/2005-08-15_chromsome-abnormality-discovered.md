Chromsome abnormality discovered

A [report](http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/15/content_468976.htm) from China has recently confirmed a Chinese male has the world’s first reported chromosomal abnormality karyotype on the third and thirteenth chromosomes.

I wonder if the Chinese scientists searched high and low for the work of the Intelligent Designer for these types of occurances can’t occur through “evolution.” {end sarcasm}

> Experts say that the discovery of this new chromosomal abnormality > karyotype not only enriches the world’s chromosome data bank, but is > also **very helpful to the study of hereditary improvement of the > human race**, and useful in the clinical studies of genetics. >
> Yang’s wife was pregnant twice, but unfortunately twice suffered a > miscarriage within the first two months of pregnancy. >
> Medical tests showed that **Yang’s third and thirteenth chromosomes > are different from those of normal people.** >
> “The two chromosomes set off a balanced translocation, which means > that the two chromosomes became fractured, and they have changed to > become two totally new chromosomes after their natural > reconstruction,” said Du Wei, doctor from Changchun Maternity > Hospital’s Cytogenetics Lab. >
> Since there was no record on balanced translocation of human’s third > and thirteenth chromosomes at home or abroad, the hospital sent Yang’s > cell sample to the National Medical Genetics Key Laboratory for > verification. >
> Since the quantity of the chromosome has not changed, Yang is no > different in appearance, personality or intelligence from a normal > human. >
> However, the couple only have a one in eighteen chance of having a > healthy child through regular pregnancy, and the child in turn has a > one in eighteen chance of inheriting the chromosomal abnormality.
