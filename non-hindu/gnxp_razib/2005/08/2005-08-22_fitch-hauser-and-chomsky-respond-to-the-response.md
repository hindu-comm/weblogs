Fitch, Hauser and Chomsky respond to the response…..

I have posted [on the “languages wars”](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003654.html) before…so I thought that I’d point out that Noam Chomsky, Marc Hauser W. T. Fitch have [responded](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T24-4GX6J5H-1&_user=10&_handle=V-WA-A-W-ZV-MsSAYZW-UUW-U-AAWDAEYWAV-AAWVDDEUAV-WEVCBVWAW-ZV-U&_fmt=summary&_coverDate=08%2F19%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%234908%239999%23999999999%2399999%21&_cdi=4908&amp;amp;amp;amp;view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=0c44054d0800332d131b7b254b88ce4a) ([full text](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/%7Ewtsf/FitchHauserChomsky.doc)) to Steven Pinker and Ray Jackendoff’s [paper](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/papers/pinker_jackendoff.pdf) which was written in response to their [initial manifesto](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002181.html). Note that this is basically back-biting amongst the “innatist” camp as regards language. Though I think Pinker and Jackendoff have run ahead of the data as far as FOXP2 goes, I suspect their tack will be more fruitful. I am not necessarily one who believes that complex behaviors are necessarily straightforward adaptations or have strong fitness implications which can’t be warped or distorted by social considerations (even if a given religious practice is functionally deleterious, if it makes you an outcaste when you dissent from the practice then your fitness drops). But, I am highly skeptical that language is such a trait, I simply do not believe that [serendipity](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003292.html) is the source of our competence at speech (or recursive capacity).
