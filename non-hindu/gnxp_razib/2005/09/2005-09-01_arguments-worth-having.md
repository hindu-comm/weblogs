"Arguments worth having …"

From an [anti-ID editorial in The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html) comes a very good list of true controversies within evolution. I was a little shocked to see mention of the controversies relating to race.

> The “[Cambrian > Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion)“ >
> Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular animals > lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low until > about 530m years ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of > many diverse marine species, including the first appearance of > molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and vertebrates. “Sudden” here is > used in the geological sense; the “explosion” occurred over a period > of 10m to 30m years, which is, after all, comparable to the time taken > to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals. This rapid > diversification raises fascinating questions; explanations include the > evolution of organisms with hard parts (which aid fossilisation), the > evolutionary “discovery” of eyes, and the development of new genes > that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently. >
> The evolutionary basis of human behaviour >
> The field of evolutionary psychology (once called “sociobiology”) > maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour (especially > sexual behaviour), as well as differences between individuals and > between ethnic groups, have a genetic basis. These traits and > differences are said to have evolved in our ancestors via natural > selection. There is much controversy about these claims, largely > because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces that acted > on our ancestors, and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on > modern humans. >
> Sexual versus natural selection >
> Although evolutionists agree that adaptations invariably result from > natural selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate > plumage of male birds and size differences between the sexes in many > species, that are better explained by “sexual selection”: selection > based on members of one sex (usually females) preferring to mate with > members of the other sex that show certain desirable traits. > Evolutionists debate how many features of animals have resulted from > sexual as opposed to natural selection; some, like Darwin himself, > feel that many physical features differentiating human “races” > resulted from sexual selection. >
> The target of natural selection >
> Evolutionists agree that natural selection usually acts on genes in > organisms – individuals carrying genes that give them a reproductive > or survival advantage over others will leave more descendants, > gradually changing the genetic composition of a species. This is > called “individual selection”. But some evolutionists have proposed > that selection can act at higher levels as well: on populations (group > selection), or even on species themselves (species selection). The > relative importance of individual versus these higher order forms of > selection is a topic of lively debate. >
> Natural selection versus genetic drift >
> Natural selection is a process that leads to the replacement of one > gene by another in a predictable way. But there is also a “random” > evolutionary process called genetic drift, which is the genetic > equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic drift leads to unpredictable > changes in the frequencies of genes that don’t make much difference to > the adaptation of their carriers, and can cause evolution by changing > the genetic composition of populations. Many features of DNA are said > to have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary geneticists disagree > about the importance of selection versus drift in explaining features > of organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that genetic drift > can’t explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is adaptive.
