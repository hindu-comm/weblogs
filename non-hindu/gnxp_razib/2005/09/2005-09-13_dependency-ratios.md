Dependency Ratios

A year or two ago I posted a lot on population topics such as fertility, life expectancy, and dependency ratios. For those who are interested in these subjects, I have put an update on [**dependency ratios**](http://politics.gnxp.com/2005/09/dependency-ratios-dont-panic.html) on the [politics board](http://politics.gnxp.com/). Even if you don’t agree with what I say, I’ve given some useful statistical sources.
