Chimp vs. human genomes

[A genome-wide survey of structural variation between human and chimpanzee](http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/gr.4338005v1):

> Structural changes (deletions, insertions, and inversions) between > human and chimpanzee genomes have likely had a significant impact on > lineage-specific evolution because of their potential for dramatic and > irreversible mutationâ€¦The events are distributed throughout the genome > on all chromosomes but are highly correlated with sites of segmental > duplication in human and chimpanzee. These structural variants > encompass at least 24 Mb of DNA and overlap with \>245 genes. > Seventeen of these genes contain exons missing in the chimpanzee > genomic sequence and also show a significant reduction in gene > expression in chimpanzee. Compared with the pioneering work of Yunis, > Prakash, Dutrillaux, and Lejeune, this analysis expands the number of > potential rearrangements between chimpanzees and humans 50-fold. Furthermore, this work prioritizes regions for further finishing in the chimpanzee genome and provides a resource for interrogating functional differences between humans and chimpanzees.
