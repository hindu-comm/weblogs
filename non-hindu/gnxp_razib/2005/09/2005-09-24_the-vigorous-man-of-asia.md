The vigorous man of Asia

Sometimes **illustration is as important as argumentation**. [The East in the West](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25turkey.html?pagewanted=print) by Chris Caldwell is just that, illustrating the rough textures of the “Turkish question.” There is very little data in Caldwell’s piece that can be quantitized. Caldwell suggests that the religiosity of Turkish petite bourgeoise is akin to ardor of the American middle class rather than the staid post-Christianity of Europe…but he [doesn’t offer survey data](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002878.html) which points to the reality that 71% of Turks affirm “strong religiosity,” as opposed to 65% of Americans, and 57% of Italians, 38% of British, 34% of French and 26% of Swedes. The piece alludes to the reality that liberalization of culture is not a necessary implication of democratization, but it never states it in a succinct and point by point fashion. Worth a read, for a reminder rather than any new insights.
