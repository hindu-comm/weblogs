Cascade effect?

Just a small real-time reflection: Watching reactions to the Miers pick among the GOP base over at www.freerepublic.com, it strikes me as if it’s not going down too well.

Another small reflection: Is pissing off the base really the right move for Bush right now? (“Tipping point” is more than the title of a Gladwell book…)
