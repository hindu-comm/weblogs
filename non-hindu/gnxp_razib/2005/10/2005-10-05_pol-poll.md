Pol poll

Been awhile since I took a politics poll. I [took this](http://www.okcupid.com/politics), and it said that I’m: “Social Liberal (75% permissive)” and “Economic Conservative (66% permissive).” No big surprise.

**Update from scottm:** Here are my scores. I’m: “social liberal (63% permissive)” and “Economic Conservative (81% permissive)”. No big suprise here either.
