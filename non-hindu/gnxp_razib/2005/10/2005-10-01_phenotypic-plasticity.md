Phenotypic plasticity….

[Hsp90 Potentiates the Rapid Evolution of New Traits: Drug Resistance in Diverse Fungi:](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/309/5744/2185)

> Hsp90 is a [molecular > chaperone](http://www.faseb.org/opar/protfold/molechap.html) for many > signal transducers and may influence evolution by releasing previously > silent genetic variation in response to environmental change. In fungi > separated by \~800 million years of evolution, Hsp90 potentiated the > evolution of drug resistance in a different way, by enabling new > mutations to have immediate phenotypic consequences. Resistance was > abrogated by Hsp90 inhibitors and by febrile temperatures, suggesting > new therapeutic strategies and a clinical benefit of fever. During > selection in a human host, drug resistance that was initially Hsp90-dependent evolved toward independence. Thus, Hsp90 can act in diverse ways to couple environmental contingency to the emergence and fixation of new traits.
