Armand on Human Diversity

[Armand Leroi](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004008.html) has a nice fluffy piece, [On Human Diversity](http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/10/24/16/1), in The Scientist. Leroi is one to keep an eye on because he is in [John Brockman’s](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/brockman.html) [stable](http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1472567,00.html), and his creatures tend to become public intellectuals rather quickly. One thing though, why is a [developmental biologist](http://armandleroi.com/research/index.html) pushing this? Neil Risch should be stepping up! But I have a sneaking suspicion that the devo will always win over evo in a war of words since the devo people can trot out 10,000 definitions to describe the progression of a zebrafish eye while the evo people can only jot down some befuddling equations. Hat tip to [Jay](https://avoyagetoarcturus.blogspot.com/).

**Update:** Go read this [post](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/003065.html#003065) from [Future Pundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/), [Genetic Analysis Shows Signs Of Selective Pressure In Human Evolution](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/003065.html#003065). By the way, doesn’t the researcher [look like a baby](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct05/Bustamante.jpg)? Of course, Brad DeLong looks [like a baby too](http://delong.typepad.com/about.html).

Update II: Also, check out Derb’s piece in NR, [The Specter of Difference](http://www.olimu.com/Journalism/Texts/Commentary/SpecterOfDifference.htm).
