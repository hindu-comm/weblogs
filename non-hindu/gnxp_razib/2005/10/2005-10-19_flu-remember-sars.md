Flu – Remember SARS?

I wanted to post a rejoinder to the avian flu discussion below. My response is to point out that pandemic flu need not kill very many people to have an enormous impact on our lives.

A Canadian investment firm [issued a report on avian flu](http://www2.bmo.com/bmo/files/news%20release/4/1/Avian%20Flu.pdf) recently. They argue that the indirect (economic) effects of a pandemic will be devastating over and above any loss of life. Their strongest evidence comes from an analysis of the economic impact of SARS on affected countries. The world-wide death toll from SARS was small (\~775 people), but its impact on GDP growth was substantial.

> The Bank of Canada estimates that the most severe economic impact was > in the second quarter when GDP growth fell from 3% in Q1/03 to -1.2% > in Q2/03. Its estimate is that SARS cut second quarter GDP by 0.6 > percentage points (Chart 1). Moderate as this estimate sounds, the > effect in Toronto was significantly more dramatic, as Toronto > represents about 15-Â–20% of overall Canadian economic activity.

Fear of infection alone will be sufficient to cause economic stagnation, and this is something to be worried about.
