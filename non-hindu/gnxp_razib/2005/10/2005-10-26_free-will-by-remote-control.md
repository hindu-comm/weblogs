Free Will by Remote Control

Over on the Mises Economic Blog, Lucretius, a neurobiologist, has written a post rebutting the contention put forward by Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen in their paper [For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything](http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu/%7Ejdgreene/NewGreene-WebPage_files/GreeneCohenPhilTrans-04.pdf) that:

> New neuroscience will change the law, not by undermining its current > assumptions, but by transforming peopleâ€™s moral intuitions about > free will and responsibility. This change in moral outlook will result > not from the discovery of crucial new facts or clever new arguments, > but from a new appreciation of old arguments, bolstered by vivid new > illustrations provided by cognitive neuroscience. We foresee, and > recommend, a shift away from punishment aimed at retribution in favour > of a more progressive, consequentialist approach to the criminal law.

I’d encourage you to read the philosophical musings being entertained but also keep in mind the [news](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051026/ap_on_hi_te/remote_control_for_humans) breaking in Japan today in which Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. researchers demonstrated a rudimentary ability to control volunteer subjects via remote control:

> A special headset was placed on my cranium by my hosts during a recent > demonstration at an NTT research center.

The article goes onto speculate about the commercialization of this technology, for both civilian and military markets. What struck me about this report was how the remote control device was stimulating the senses and causing the brain to induce action, but instead of free will being the agent of initiation, it was an external electrical current acting on the nerves and initiating the cascade of processes that followed.
