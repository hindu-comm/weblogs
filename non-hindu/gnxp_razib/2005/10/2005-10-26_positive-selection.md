Positive Selection

Genes such as [G6PD](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000528.htm), [ASPM](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=aspm&btnG=Search+google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com), and hemochromatosis are known to be undergoing strong positive selection in humans. You see a high-frequency variant with next-to-no variety and lots of [linkage disequilibrium](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Linkage_disequilibrium.asp).

If you had to guess, what fraction of human genes would you expect to be currently experiencing such strong positive selection?
