Noise

[NOISE AND DELAYS EXPLAIN WHY SOME GENES OSCILLATE IN ACTIVITY  
](http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news_events/releases/release.sfe?id=481)  
â€œunscripted biochemical variations, or noise, combined with time delays in certain biochemical reactions may lead to oscillations in gene regulation that couldnâ€™t otherwise be predicted. Such noise is routinely described by cell biologists who record large phenotypic differences between supposedly identical cells in a single flask of growth medium.â€?  
â€¦  
â€œThe fine-grain fluctuations we see in the genetic regulation within single cells may lead to new insights about variability at the level of the whole organismâ€?

Noise is under appreciated. Some speculation on noiseâ€¦

Noise prevents sharp â€œedgeâ€? effects. Imagine a thermostat with no â€œnoiseâ€?. Too cold then turn on, too hot then turn off, the heater would be continually turning on and off. Slop in a steering wheel is another example. If the wheel is too responsive then the driver over corrects.

â€œNoiseâ€? in the genome: Mutations generate new gene alleles. If the new allele significantly improves fitness then it rapidly increases in frequency. If the new allele significantly decreases fitness, then it may disappear. But many mutations wonâ€™t have much of an effect either way. Such gene alleles act as genetic â€œnoiseâ€?. Such genetic noise produces statistical â€œoutliersâ€? that are extreme phenotypes. (E.g., very high IQ.)

Gene allele â€œoutliersâ€? provide feedback. If the environment changes so that the â€œoutlierâ€? significantly improves fitness then that gene allele frequency increases and the population rapidly adapts. Negative â€œoutliersâ€? would â€œpushâ€? the population away from the â€œbadâ€? allele. Thus noise makes the genome more robust and stable.

Molecular noise provides the random generator needed to for our bodyâ€™s immune system to build broad coverage against potential invaders and generate new antibodies to specific molecular targets against invaders that make it past the first immune barrier.

Noise can provide the â€œmutationsâ€? in a Darwinian mechanism such as might occur in thinking and skill learning. (Similar to â€œheatâ€? in simulated annealing.)

Noise keeps certain neuronal systems healthy. Too little noise can lead to heart attacks or seizures.

Update from Razib: Look in the gnxp files for “noise,” that is the PDF of the paper that the article is based on.
