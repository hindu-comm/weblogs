China In The News

Here are five links that I thought noteworthy today.

The first is news that Chinese researchers have [broken the SHA-1 hashing algorithm](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1_broken.html) which was developed by the National Security Agency and which allows crytographic security for such mundane things as internet commerce. Here is [background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) on SHA. Here is piece, from August, on the [significance](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000661.html) of SHA.

The [second development](http://news.ft.com/cms/s/b5f01a94-804f-11d9-bd50-00000e2511c8.html) is the CIA, in its annual assessment of worldwide threats, has dropped all mention of US-Chinese cooperation and has instead focused on China’s determined military and diplomatic efforts to counter what it sees as US efforts to contain or encircle China.

Third item of note regarding China has to do with its [statement](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-02/17/content_2588766.htm) on the Kyoto Accord going into effect and how the Chinese are urging the signatories to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible. Note that the Chinese are exempt from the treaty. A related [development](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-02/17/content_2589303.htm) is that parts of Northeast China are seeing their farm output increasing due to warming trends.

The fourth item of note is that of the warming of [bilateral relations](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-02/18/content_417242.htm) between China and India.

And the fifth item is that China has [overtaken](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/GB18Ad01.html) the US as the world’s leading consumer of resources.

It’s kind of a China news day, don’t you think?
