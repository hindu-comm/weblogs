Dammit, I want to know what makes Penguins gay!

In [comments](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/3588#201781), Rikurzhen pointed to an essay published in Science that detailed efforts to suppress science:

There is growing concern about the politicization and social control of science, constraining the conduct, funding, publication, and public use of scientific research. For example, human cloning and embryonic stem cell creation have been regulated or banned, activists have been lobbying Congress to remove funding from certain government-sponsored research, and science journal editors have been compelled to develop policies for publication of sensitive manuscripts.

Forbidden knowledge embodies the idea that there are things that we should not know. Knowledge may be forbidden because it can only be obtained through unacceptable means, such as human experiments conducted by the Nazis; knowledge may be considered too dangerous, as with weapons of mass destruction or research on sexual practices that undermine social norms; and knowledge may be prohibited by religious, moral, or secular authority, exemplified by human cloning.

We’ve all been witness to the Luddite Left’s efforts to suppress research on gender issues, and we’re already well aware of the career dangers involved in investigating issues related to race. I’m sure that science focused on sexual orientation is just as touchy, but perhaps things are going off the deep end when these luddite acitivists start protesting to keep [gay penguins gay](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,12225069-13762,00.html).

A PLAN by a German zoo to test the sexual appetites of a group of suspected homosexual penguins has sparked outrage among gay and lesbian groups, who fear zookeepers might force them to turn straight.”All sorts of gay and lesbian associations have been emailing and calling in to protest,” said a spokesman for the zoo in the north-western city of Bremerhaven.

He said the zoo had concluded the penguins might be gay after seeing male penguins trying to mate with other males and trying to hatch offspring out of stones.

German media reported that female Swedish penguins would be brought to the zoo to test the theory, but when word got out about the plan, the phones started ringing.

“Nobody here is trying to break-up same-sex pairs by force,” the zoo’s director Heike Kueck told public broadcaster NDR.

“We don’t know if the three male pairs are really gay or just got together because of a lack of females.”
