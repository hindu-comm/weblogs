Problems in Malmö

We seem to be on a Sweden kick of late, so let me continue the trend with a few more links of interest, these mainly dealing with immigration problems. Here is a clip from [Swedish TV](http://aeonflux.exctazy.org/brl/misc/welcome_to_sweden.mpg) about a Fox report about Malmö’s immigrant problem. Here is a lengthy article entitled [A Swedish Dilemma](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=5271&R=C42B38DD1). Here is an article that gives some [background](http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/ahrus.htm) on issues facing Denmark. Here is a lengthy article from Policy Review entitled [Denmark, the Euro, And Fear of the Foreign](http://www.policyreview.org/dec00/Bering.html) and last, but certainly not least, is the famous David Goodhart essay [Discomfort of Strangers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1154684,00.html) that challenged liberals to rethink their attitudes to diversity and the welfare state.
