Holidays for the rest of us…transnationalists

Some of those commenting on “Church & State in Togo” are speculating about possible religious syncretisms. In the spirit of [Chrismukkah](http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/story.cgi?show=112&story=5888&limit=all&sort=) or, if you prefer, [Chrismahanukwanzakah](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/000882.html), I offer the following:

Ramadan + Diwali = Ramawali

Hajj + Hanukkah = Hajjnukkah

Christmas + Nawruz = Feliz Navruz

Oh, and happy [Basant](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/international/asia/07lahore.html)!
