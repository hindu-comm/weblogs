Women in physics….

A semi-follow up of the [Larry Summers controversy](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003491.html), [Women in Physics Match Men in Success](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/22/science/22phys.html?). The article notes that:

The proportion of women earning bachelors and PhDs in physics has been increasing.  
Women who receive their bachelors have just as much success in getting into the PhD, and later academic, track, as men.  
There is considerable international variation in the frequency of women in physics.

First, please note, the relative competence of female physicists isn’t particularly surprising if generally objective standards of excellence are enforced irrespective of gender (give or take some discrimination as well as outreach). By analogy, if you set a high upper body strength threshold for qualification to become a firefighter, though few women might be able to measure up (and many men wouldn’t be able to either), those who did pass the requirements would not compare too badly against the majority of their male comrades (of course, it is likely that the males would skew toward the high end when compared to the women because of the nature of truncating two very different distributions).

I have pointed to the variability in frequency of [females in the mathematical sciences before](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003476.html) in cross country comparisons (see this [map](http://www.awis.org/resource/statistics/euromath.jpg) which relates to mathematics professors in Europe). Seeing as how there seems to be evidence that the modal frequency of females in the hard sciences seems to be in south-east & south-west Europe, with a relative dearth in north-central Europe and Scandinavia, I am not sure if a standard “sexism” model really works well. Additionally, if you follow the [this link](http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/science-society/pdf/she_figures_2003.pdf), you will note that in Europe there still remains a general trend where the male proportion is highest in mechanical engineering, and lowest in the humanities, transnationally. Even in Mongolia, where this is [currently a very strong female bias in education](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003545.html), males hold their own (only) in the hard sciences. To me, this suggests there are relatively static non-environmental factors, perhaps amplified by gene ([expression](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003595.html))-environment correlation, underneath the cross-cultural variation.

Finally, even if the majority of physics degree holders are female, that does not address Summers points about [variance](http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/normal_distribution.html) and allocation of time (preferences?). It is a complex topic, and an intersection of multiple factors and amplifying correlated tendnecies might mean that the top physicists remain male, even when there is relatively gender parity1….

1 – The article implicitly ignores Summers’ point about variability, assuming that parity of numbers might contradict a hypothesis of instrinsic difference.
