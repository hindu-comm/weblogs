The Science of Snowflakes

I know it sounds like something only a kid would be interested in, but Caltech has a website up that very seriously looks into the [Science of Snowflakes](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/primer/primer.htm). It goes fairly in depth about how they form and why they form such different forms. A fun site that allowed me to draw on my crystallograhy background.

P.S. Someone should have edited the page as this line comes up

Ice Ih is the normal form of ice; ice Ic is formed by depositing vapor at very low temperatures (below 140Â°K)

Anyone see the problem in that line?
