More on the landscape….

[PERSPECTIVE:**SIGN EPISTASIS** AND GENETIC CONSTRAINT ON EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES](http://evol.allenpress.com/evolonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0014-3820&volume=059&issue=06&page=1165):

So the deviation is flipping between positive and negative and deep fitness valleys separate peaks, impeding the exploration of the adaptive landscape. At least that’s how I read it….
