Engineer Atta

From [Perfect Soldiers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=geneexpressio-20&amp;creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0060584696/qid=1121318499/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books):

> \[page 15-16\]  
> …It’s hard to overemphasize the respect accorded to engineers in much > of the Middle East…Within the engineering department, the > highest-scoring students were assigned to the architecture program…for > the first time in his life, Amir \[Mohammed Atta\] did not excel. > Architecture, more than most creative disciplines, is a blend of the > utterly pragmatic-what type of glass do you specify to keep heat out > and let light in?-and the artistic-in what vocabulary should a house > speak? Amir shone at the analytical subjects…. >
> “He was a very clever person in mathematics, physical structures, less > good in design and the more artistic aspects…In the third year, when > we studied soils, street plans, and steel, something more concrete, he > excelled…you would recognize him more as an engineer than an > architect….  
> …  
> \[page 5\]  
> “The jihad for God’s cause is hard for the infidels, because our > religion has ordered us to cut their throats and that we kill their > heirs is a hard thing…God the merciful has created the hell for the > infidels as he created the paradise for the believers….  
> …  
> \[page 33\]  
> …He did what he was told and did it…with extraordinary > single-mindedness. Although already a trained architect and a > prospective city planner, Amir-in four years at the company-never once > offerred an opinion of the plans he was asked to illustrated. He was > assigned to make maps; he made maps.

I have spoken before of [norms of reaction](http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-N/norm_of_reaction.html), that is, the differential expression of phenotype given the same genotype in a variety of “environments.” More later….
