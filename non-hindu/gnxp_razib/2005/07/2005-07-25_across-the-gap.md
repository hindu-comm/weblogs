Across the gap

[RAPID EVOLUTIONARY ESCAPE BY LARGE POPULATIONS FROM LOCAL FITNESS PEAKS IS LIKELY IN NATURE](http://evol.allenpress.com/evolonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0014-3820&volume=059&issue=06&page=1175):

Frequent recombination may > disrupt high-fitness escape genotypes produced in populations larger > than *Ncrit* before they reach fixation, defining a third regime whose > rate again slows with increasing population size.

Thus, counterintuitively, mass selection alone offers a biologically realistic resolution to the problem of evolutionary escape from local fitness peaks in natural populations.

Please note I’m not making assertions about the ubiquity of these novel processes. I suspect they play a role in speciation, but I won’t wager any guesses beyond that.
