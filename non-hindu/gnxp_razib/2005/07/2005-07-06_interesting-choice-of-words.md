Interesting choice of words

[Deutschland’s Iron Lady – Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher?](http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/#ContinueArticle):

Voter schizophrenia is exacerbating tensions within the CDU, which is actually an alliance between the more free-market-oriented Christian Democrats, from which Merkel hails, and the more economically liberal Bavarian Christian Social Union.

Constrasting “free-market-oriented” and “economically liberal” makes some sense in the United States, but why use Americo-centric terms without explanation in European politics where “liberalism” tends to have free-market connotations? (see the [Free Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_%28Germany%29))
