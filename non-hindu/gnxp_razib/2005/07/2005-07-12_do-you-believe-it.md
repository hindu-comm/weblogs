Do you believe it?

That [additive genetic variance](http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-A/additive_genetic_variance.html)1 can **increase** after a founder event because various alleles can fix onto the genetic background and subtract epistatic effects which would normally cancel out? This is important since response to selection \~ additive genetic variance \* selection coefficient. Researcher dissents/critiques welcome.

**Update:** Consider epistatic effects which cancel out over the genetic background because the deviation is sometimes positive and negative (Fisher would be proud). A founder event could move some loci to fixation, which frees up some of the other loci2 to work their additive variational magic. A [rugged and fitness constrained](http://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/GA/Bitmaps/adaptive.landscape.gif) landscape is now transformed into a clean and conical [Fisherian geometry](http://www.revitcity.com/forum_files/Ruled%20Curtain%20Wall%20Cone.jpg). Do you think this sort of process is evolutionarily relevant?

1 – The variance crucial for microevolutionary process, as in the [breeder’s equation](http://www.biology.duke.edu/rausher/lec11.htm).

2 – Which were previously hooked into pairwise fitness deviating epistatic interactions.
