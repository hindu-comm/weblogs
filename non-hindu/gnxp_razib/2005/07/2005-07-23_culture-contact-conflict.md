Culture Contact/Conflict

Iâ€™ve just made [brief post](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rfmcdpei/825809.html) up on my blog regarding the rather virulent and violent strain of homophobia in the Muslim world, as a problem in itself and as a marker of deeper problems. Out of curiosity, how would GNXP readers go about trying to remedy these issues? What techniques of mimetic engineering would you apply?
