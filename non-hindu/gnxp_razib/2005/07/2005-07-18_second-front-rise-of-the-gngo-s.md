Second front: Rise of the GNGO:s

I have [previously covered](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004164.html) the main front in the struggle against freedom of speech in Europe – hate speech laws. Now it’s time to move on to another, more low-profile phenomenon: The Governmental Non-Governmental Organization, or GNGO for short.

The GNGO is a tax-payer-funded organization, set up by the government to promote a specific policy, or point of view.

Sweden has naturally been at the forefront of this effort to snuff out incorrect thinking. Using organizations such as “[Flicka](http://www.flicka.gov.se/)”, “[Centrum mot Rasism](http://www.centrummotrasism.nu/)”, and “[Forum Syd](http://www.forumsyd.se/)”, the government has been able to:

– [Criticize magazine publishers](http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/3344/a/41730) who publish incorrect, sexist material. (On huge subway billboards, no less…)

– Fight the [menace of racist ice cream](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003921.html).

– [Promote Global Jihad](http://www.mothugg.se/item/129), as well as a deeper understanding of (often misunderstood) North Korea and Cuba.

Now however, it appears that the GNGO:s [have hit a spot of trouble](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_10152057.asp). It has been revealed that the aforementioned “Centrum mot Rasism”:

– Has done preciously little, except for running up large hotel and restaurant bills.

– Has been taken over by representatives of the ruling Social Democrats and the Greens.

– …carried out the aforementioned attack on racist ice cream mostly as a ploy to cover up their own inaction.

Only time will tell if this will stem the tide of governmental non-governmental organizations attempting to snuff out incorrect thinking. I sort of doubt it.
