Mosques for brown women?

Just heard a report on the [BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/index.shtml) about a group of women who are getting together to start their own mosque in [Tamil Nadu](http://www.answers.com/tamil%20nadu) because of complaints of secondary status and exclusion from the mainstream mosques run by the local Muslim associations (exclusively male of course). Standard issue hostility and threats ensue. Hopefully this is the thin edge of a persistent wedge. I’m not a big fan of religion personally, but seeing as it seems plausible that the majority of the human race in the near future will bend their knee to some deity, I’d rather have such activities in a social context be decentralized among many players rather than under the thumbs of a few scary-dudes-with-beards. Signs of a feminist streak among Muslim women in China and India are a good.
