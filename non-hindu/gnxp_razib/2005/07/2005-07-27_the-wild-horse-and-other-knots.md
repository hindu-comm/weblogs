The wild "horse" and other knots

[Przewalski’s Horse](http://www.imh.org/imh/bw/prz.html):

> Some authorities believe the Przewalski is a direct ancestor of the > modern day domesticated horse. Others contend this is not possible as > the **Przewalski is a different species having sixty-six chromosomes > while the domestic horse carries sixty-four**. It is possible to cross > the Przewalski with the domestic horse, and the **resulting hybrid is > fertile**; however this offspring has sixty-five chromosomes. When crossed again to the domestic horse, the new generation returns to sixty-four chromosomes and little influence of the Przewalski horse is evident.

> The animal family tree may not be filled just with forks, but may also contain knots: hybrid species with two different ancestors rather than one, according to a team of Penn State researchers.

“Hybrid” speciation is pretty common in plants from what I know, but the issues surrounding animals are sketchier….
