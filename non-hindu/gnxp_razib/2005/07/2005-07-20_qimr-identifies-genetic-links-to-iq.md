QIMR Identifies Genetic Links to IQ

[QIMR Scientists Identify Genetic Links to Human Intelligence](http://www.qimr.edu.au/news/2005/genesforiq.html):

> The QIMR group, led by Professor Nick Martin, has identified specific > locations on Chromosomes 2 and 6 as being highly influential in > determining IQ. To do this, they applied multipoint linkage analysis to data from 634 sibling pairs (including non-identical twins) from Australia and the Netherlands who were genetically scanned for the study. >
> Although earlier twin studies had revealed the existence of genes that > dictated human intelligence, usual genetic association methods had not been effective in identifying them. Where association analysis may overlook closely spaced genes that act together to affect a trait, linkage analysis is more sensitive to such combined effects. >
> Traditional IQ tests are designed to assess abilities across different > areas – memory, vocabulary, semantics, symbolic reasoning – > collectively grouped into higher orders such as verbal and performance > intelligence. The region on Chromosome 2 shows significant links to > performance IQ, also overlapping a region associated with autism. The region on Chromosome 6 showed strong links with both full-scale and verbal IQ with a marginal overlap to an area implicated in reading disability and dyslexia. >
> During the study, where the non-identical twins and other sibling pairs had significant differences in IQ, they also had significant variation in these regions on Chromosomes 2 and 6.
