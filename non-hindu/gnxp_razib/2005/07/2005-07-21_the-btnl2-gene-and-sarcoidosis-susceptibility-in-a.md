The BTNL2 Gene and Sarcoidosis Susceptibility in African Americans and Whites

[Abstract](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v77n3/42221/brief/42221.abstract.html):

> …Although rs2076530 was not associated with sarcoidosis in either > African American sample, a three-locus haplotype that included > rs2076530 was associated with sarcoidosis across all three study > samples. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that BTNL2 > effects are **independent of human leukocyte antigen class II genes in whites but may *interact antagonistically* in African Americans**. Our results underscore the complexity of genetic risk for sarcoidosis emanating from the MHC region.
