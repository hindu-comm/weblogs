Ancient DNA….

Dienekes links to two recent papers, [one](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2005/07/25800-year-old-australoid-from.html) indicates that a pre-Mongoloid substrate existed in Thailand \~30,000 years B.P. through inspection of fossil morphology, while extracted mtDNA shows similarities to the non-Malay Semang peoples of the interior of Malaysia, [another article](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2005/07/10300-year-old-alaskan-had-mtdna.html) confirms the ancient status of many Native American lineages through comparison with a 10,300 sequence of mtDNA.
