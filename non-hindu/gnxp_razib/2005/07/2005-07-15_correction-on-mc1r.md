Correction on MC1R….

I misreported Heather Norton’s presentation in the [post below](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/model-rising.php). I emailed her a few questions, and she responded:

> Actually, my data do not show that Europeans and East Asians have > different MC1R alleles, but rather that they appear to be different > for two alleles in the genes TYR and MATP. I didn’t see strong > differences between Europeans and East Asians at the two MC1R SNPs > that I genotyped…you stated that I had presented them at a conference > in Europe.

She can’t answer my direct questions right now because there is a paper pending publication. Here is her abstract from the presentation:
