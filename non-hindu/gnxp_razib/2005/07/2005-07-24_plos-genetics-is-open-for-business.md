PLOS Genetics is open for business!

[PLOS Genetics](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=index-html&issn=1553-7404) is online today! The full [interview](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010014) with Neil Risch is up. Snip that might interest readers:

> Clinton, for example, when the first draft of the human genome > sequence came out, made a statement about how all people in the world, > in terms of their genetic makeup, are 99.9% the same. His intentâ€”to > reduce conflict among peoplesâ€”is noble. People on the left, > anthropologists and sociologists, do the same thing. They use the > 99.9% figure as an argument for social equality. But the truth is that people do differ by that remaining 0.1% and that people do cluster according to their ancestry. The problem is that others could use that information to create division.
