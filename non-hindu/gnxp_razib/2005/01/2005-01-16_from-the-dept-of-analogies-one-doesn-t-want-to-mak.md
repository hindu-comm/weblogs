From the Dept. of Analogies One Doesn't Want to Make

John at [Discriminations](http://www.discriminations.us/storage/003020.html) points me to this Newsweek quote:

Rolling back the legacy of apartheid—essentially an affirmative-action program for the white minority—was the African National Congress’s top priority when it took power in 1994. But now the ANC’s own affirmative-action campaign is under siege.

I’m not sure that they really want to equate Affirmative Action with Apartheid but who am I to say.
