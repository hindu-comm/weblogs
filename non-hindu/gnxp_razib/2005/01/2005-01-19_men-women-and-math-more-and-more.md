Men, women and math…more, and more….

[E-mail exchange with Steven Pinker](http://www.thecrimson.com/today/article505366.html%20) in The Harvard Crimson (via [Steve](http://www.isteve.com):

Look, the truth cannot be offensive. Perhaps the hypothesis is wrong, but how would we ever find out whether it is wrong if it is “offensive” even to consider it?

This [map](http://www.awis.org/resource/statistics/euromath.jpg) of tenured female mathematicians by country is interesting. Two things of note:  
1) A vey low frequency of women as mathematicians seems to characterize Protestant Northern Europe!  
2) Turkey has a greater proportion of female mathematicians than most of Europe!

A [graph](http://www.awis.org/resource/statistics/UK_2000.jpg) which shows the frequency of females in various scientific fields in the UK shows the same rank order of discipline as the US. This is important, I think the frequency might differ from country to country, but what would be very curious is if the rank order of disciplines differed (that is, a far higher frequency of females in engineering than biology). The proportion of females within a given field might be elastic given certain variables shifting, but, if there is an innate aptitude/preference difference, the underlaying bias toward or away from certain fields will remain.

Finally, this [large PDF](http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/science-society/pdf/she_figures_2003.pdf) is chock full of statistics broken down by European country. Haven’t examined it in detail, though many of the tables do show the same rank order, though there is a wide variation between countries.

TangoMan adds: Look to Jane Galt for about the most [rational post](http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005134.html) I’ve found on this issue, other than our own of course. From what I’ve seen of the Left’s discourse on this issue, I’m of the same mind as [Steve Sailer.](http://www.isteve.com/05JanB.htm#nancy.hopkins) I thought the issue of gender differences was more understood and accepted than this whole imbroglio has revealed and man, (oops, I must be a sexist, hang on – yeah, strike that last utterance of man) person, we’ve got our work cut out for us.

Lastly, let’s all give a salute to the woman who has made a caricature of herself as a scientist who either blacks out or throws up when presented with a hypothesis that she finds distasteful.

Here’s to you Dr. Nancy Hopkins – the laughing stock of academia.
