Reality TV + Genetics, Part Two

It seems some themes have quite a lengthy half-life. Once again I revisit the topic of bizarre reality television programming. You may recall last summer‚Äôs [post](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002471.html) about a live fertilization, so it shouldn‚Äôt come as a shock to you that German TV is planning to find [Germany‚Äôs Most Virile Man:](http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1248875.html)

A new reality TV show has been launched in Germany to find the man with the fastest sperm.

The sperm will be attracted to the finishing line by a chemical lure identical to that emitted by the female egg in the womb.

The aim is to find Germany‚Äôs most virile man in a new reality show being dubbed Sperm Race.

Twelve men, including two celebrities and a ‚Äòhealth freak‚Äô, will take part in the show set to be aired later this year.

The show will follow the contestants as they make donations at a sperm bank. The frozen sperm will then be transported to the studio in Cologne.

Borris Brandt, 43, head of production company Endemol in Germany, rejected protests that the show was unethical, saying no human eggs would be fertilised.

‚ÄúThe main prize in the competition is a Porsche, not a baby. It‚Äôs actually a very scientific programme and the topic of fertility is massive in Germany at the moment,‚Äù he said.

The sperm will be released into a test tube in which a chemical substance will draw the fluid towards it

The winner will be pronounced by a team of doctors including a gynaecologist, an andrologist and a urologist.

Brandt added: ‚ÄúThe programme isn‚Äôt immoral. We‚Äôre only testing, we‚Äôre not conceiving.‚Äù

Alas, they aren‚Äôt the fastest out of the gate, the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3614407.stm) beat them to it. Puns intended üôÇ
