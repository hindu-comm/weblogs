On a lighter note…

The Oscar nominations are just out. For a full list go [here](http://www.oscar.com/nominees/).

In the Best Actor category the nominations are Leo Di Caprio, Jamie Foxx, Johnny Depp (Neverland), Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby), and Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda).

In the Best Actress category the nominations are Hilary Swank, Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake), Annette Bening, Catalina Sandino Moreno, and Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine). I haven’t seen Catalina’s film, but of the other performances the winner should be Imelda Staunton, but I can’t quite see the Oscar going to a dowdy middle-aged abortionist.

For patriotic British readers wishing to maximise their ethnic non-genetic interests, the nominees to root for are Imelda Staunton, Kate Winslet, Clive Owen (nominated for best supporting actor in Closer), and Sophie Okonedo (nominated for best supporting actress in Hotel Rwanda). Disgracefully, but predictably, most of the initial British reports on the nominations haven’t noticed that she is British (she’s one of those Anglo-Bantu hybrids Frank Salter is so worried about).
