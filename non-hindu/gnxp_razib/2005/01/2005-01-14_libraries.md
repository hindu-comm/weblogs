Libraries

Some readers might guess that I’m a chronic user (abuser?) of the public library system (I also have a “community” account at the local college library, which I get by paying a yearly fee). With that admission I link to this [Defense of Public Libraries](https://cityofbrass.blogspot.com/2005/01/in-defense-of-public-libraries.html) by Aziz (in response to another blogger who suggests [closing down public libraries](http://www.redstate.org/story/2005/1/13/10287/0387) because of the profusion of stores like Barnes & Noble and Borders). The only points I would like to add:

1.  Interlibrary loan is a crucial resource for many (especially in
    small communities not served by the large chain stores in the first
    place). 2.  In the past few years it seems clear that a certain segment of the
    populace depends on public libraries for internet access.

Of course, many communities that have budget shortfalls will likely have to cut back on libraries, especially if essentials like education and public services are underfunded.
