Estrogen Level Rising at Gene Expression

Has anyone else noticed a change in the estrogen level here lately? I see a lot more XX types commenting and posting at gnxp. For example, long-time gnxper [Jacqueline](http://jacquelinepassey.blogs.com/) calls our attention to [this article](http://www.jsonline.com/alive/family/jun01/girls05060401.asp) on a possible correlation between iron deficiency and math skills in girls. razib provides the complete pdf [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/107/6/1381).Also, the whole ‚ÄúSummerian‚Äù issue seems to have drawn an influx of females, empirically supporting Summer‚Äôs position, in that they represent females in science and math, in approximately the predicted ratios. üôÇ

Addendum: Gnxp readers, please take the sex-and-MBTI survey in the extended entry‚Äì I need sample size! üôÇ

It would be nice if something as fixable as iron deficiency totally informed the differences between the sexes in math aptitude, but I doubt that is a viable hypothesis. There are gross morphological variations between male and female brains and hormonal differences as well. Would you help me test my hypothesis? I remember the last time razib polled readership gnxp was 92% XY. Please vote. üôÇ
