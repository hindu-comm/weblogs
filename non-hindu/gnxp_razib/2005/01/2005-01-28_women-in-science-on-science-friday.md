The guests are Nancy Hopkins (you know her), [Marianne Bronner-Fraser](http://biology.caltech.edu/Members/Bronner-Fraser) (biology, Caltech), [Meg Urry](http://pantheon.yale.edu/~cmu2/) (physics, Caltech) and [Nicole Weekes](http://bryson.pomona.edu/4d.acgi$ViewFacultyMember459) (psychology, Pomona).

Related: Over at his fMRI blog Aziz [comments](https://refscan.blogspot.com/2005/01/men-and-women-use-different-brain.html) on the [different uses of gray and white matter by men and women](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003482.html). [Meghan O’Rourke](http://www.slate.com/id/2112799/) in Slate slams Summers for his tactlessness. She makes a good point about the “blind audition” isssue, but tends to talk about average differences (even though she acknowledges that the tails are what matters) and uses value laden terms like superiority.
