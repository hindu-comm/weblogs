Consciousness After Descartes

My inital reaction to the virtual lesbian threeway depicted in the second edition of Masamune Shirow’s manga [Ghost in the Shell](https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1569710813/qid=1107040209/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_3_6/702-9765369-1316820), back when I [first read it](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rfmcdpei/592808.html) in January, was that it was just a throwaway scene aimed at a teenage male market. I’m not so sure now.

To be sure, the teenage-male demographic does play a major role. Consider the plausibility of a government that allows Motoko Kusanagi–an elite agent from a top-secret rapid response team–to prostitute herself in exchange for proscribed sensory technologies. The fact of her apparent heterosexuality isn’t such a major issue, considering the relative pliability of many people’s sexual orientations. The thing that redeemed this ménage à trois, even partially, was the reaction of an uninvolved fourth party to the affair. An onlooker, the male Bato, is sent to interrupt the virtual scenario, tapping into the mind-to-mind transmissions to and from Motoko, data streams which (of course) reflect the ways in which these three women feel and relate to their bodies. Bato finds himself sickened, since things aren’t supposed to feel that way, things feel wrong.

Descartes’ mind-body dualism–his [separation](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/Mind/Descartes.html) of mind from body–seems radically untenable, given what we know in the 21st century about the ways in which human consciousness is determined by human physicality. The writings of [Oliver Sacks](http://www.oliversacks.com/), to name a single author of many, go into enough detail to make the Cartesian ideal of a mind detached from material reality certainly inachievable. The final failure of this ideal, though, leaves wide open the question of just how portable human experiences actually are, and how much for human personality is determined by the specific form of one’s physical self.

I’ve often wondered what it would be like to invert my sexual orientation with some future medical treatment, to shift from 5.0-5.5 on the Kinsey scale to 0.5-1.0. Four necessary qualifiers: reality-based (not be a simple redefinition like that of [ex-gays](https://www.exgaywatch.com/)); safe; inexpensive; and, reversible. What is it like to feel heterosexual? I wonder. Not the least interesting possibility would be the question of how I’d relate to previous homosedxual encounters and relationships.

Three questions for further debate.

How much empathy can we actually feel for other people? I’m an individual from the species Homo sapiens sapiens, I’m male, I’m white, I wear glasses to compensate for my poor eyesight, I’m mainly homosexual in orientation, I’m left-handed. Without living within the skin of another person–and how to do this, barring truly stupendous leaps in multiple technological fields, I leave to the science-fiction writer–how can we understand what it feels like to be them? We can make estimates, yes, but only estimates.If we can inject an individual of the species Pan troglodytes troglodytes with the [SIV-cpz](http://www.projinf.org/whatsnew/wn-9903.html) virus in order to [gain insight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9989410&dopt=Abstract) into the origins and epidemiology of the HIV-1 virus, why not inject a mentally disabled individual of the species Homo sapiens sapiens with HIV-1 to study the progress of the disease? Yes, the latter would be a monstrous act: Lethal medical experimentation has been recognized as a crime against humanity since the Nuremberg Trials, and there is a clear responsibility. But why is it monstrous? In both cases, you’re dealing with individuals from tool-using, language-using species which manifest a certain degree of consciousness. Should physical forms determine so much about the treatment of conscious individuals?GURPS’ [Transhuman Space](http://www.sjgames.com/transhuman/) RPG setting is one of a variety of fictional future settings that describes the proliferation beyond the expected artificial intelligences, with animals [uplifted](http://www.davidbrin.com/upliftbooks.html) into sentience and human personalities copied over to computer storage. This diversity is all well and good for fiction, and perhaps it isn’t an impossible goal for a relatively distant future. How will we be able to relate to these new peers of ours, though, existing as they would in subjective states so different from those of human beings?
