DNA Damage and Aging

This may be of interest to the SENS/lifespan extension crowd.

While discussing aging with a colleague, she mentioned that the latest theory is that DNA damage is the proximal cause of aging, and that strategies to cure aging will be limited to future genetations by this fact.

I found a good review paper ([PDF reprint online](http://bioweb.usc.edu/courses/2004-fall/documents/bisc461-DNA&aging.pdf%20)) on the topic of dsDNA damage and aging. I find it fairly convincing. A quick summary:

1\. Hypothesis: oxidative damage to DNA causes aging  
2. All of the thus far identified premature aging syndromes in mammals involve mutations in nuclear proteins (e.g., lamin A in progeria)  
3. Nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks, but it frequently fails to restore the original DNA sequence  
4. Homologous recombination (HR) is the non-destructive alternative to NHEJ  
5. Gametes use HR over NHEJ (the germline is immortal); as do birds and bats compared to land mammals (with a corresponding greater lifespan)

The [SENS proposal for chromosomal DNA damage](http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/cancer.htm) only seems to address telomere shortening. Stem cell therapy is one possible work-around, but not for all tissues. I cannot imagine a good regenerative technology to address this factor in aging. Any suggestions?
