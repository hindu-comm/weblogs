Innate Primate Behaviors

See this news [report](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/03/050321083933.htm) on research into ‘hard-wired’ behavio(u)r patterns among primates, some of which go far back into evolutionary history.

The headline describes this as ‘surprising’, but it is only surprising if you start from the position of a ‘blank slate’ dogma.
