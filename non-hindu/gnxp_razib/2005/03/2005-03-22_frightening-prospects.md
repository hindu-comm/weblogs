Frightening Prospects

This sounds amazingly bad. [Algis Kuliukas](http://www.riverapes.com/) tells me that Elaine Morgan, leading spokesperson for the [horrid “Aquatic Ape Theory”](http://www.aquaticape.org/), has a [new book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0952562022/qid%3D1111556345/026-0415541-0096414) out that, in his words, “takes on the accepted wisdom which has lead to each and every aspect of neo-Darwinism being accepted without question in some circles. From E O Wilson’s ‘Sociobiology: The New Synthesis’ through to Hamilton’s Kin Selection and Triver’s Reciprocal Altruism and associated game theories, she turns them over and revisits our assumptions about them. From Dawkins’ meme to ‘The Natural History of Rape’ and from Evolutionary Psychology to ‘The Blank Slate’, Elaine reminds us of anomalies and problems and provides tough, hard-nosed reasons not to get too carried away with all the hype.”

Morgan vs. Trivers and Hamilton. Can you imagine a debate thats anymore intellectually lopsided?
