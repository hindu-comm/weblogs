The invisible Asian

[Little Advance Is Seen in Ivies’ Hiring of Minorities and Women](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/education/01college.html?ex=1110344400&en=003396a11f466369&ei=5070).

Here is the [full report](http://www.yaleunions.org/geso/reports/Ivy.pdf) (PDF) that the article above is based on.

The word “Asian” does not show up once in The New York Times article. It pops up 4 times in the report itself, 3 of them are embedded in charts and one of them is a footnote. There is no mention of Asian Americans in the text.

Doctoral Degree Program Enrollment, 2001IvyNationalBlack 3.7% 8.9%Hispanic 3.1% 5.3%Asian/Pacific Islander 7.1% 5.1%American Indian/Alaska Native 0.3% 0.6%International Scholars 34.7% 13.1%Women 46.0% 58.2%

60% of graduate students are women! If women have an aversion to pairing up with males with lower educational qualifications, it makes sense that female education correlates negatively with fertility….

Addendum: William asks about the number of women getting education doctorates. [The Digest of Education Statistics 2003](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d03/lt3.asp) is a good source for that sort of information. As a point of fact the slight majority of doctorates in 2003 were awarded to men, while of female doctorates 23% were in Education as opposed to 10% for males.
