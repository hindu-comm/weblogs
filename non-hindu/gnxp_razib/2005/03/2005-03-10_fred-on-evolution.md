Fred on Evolution

Every now and then someone capable of reasonable thought writes out [a long attack on evolution](http://www.fredoneverything.net/EvolutionMonster.shtml), and I feel like responding with a persuasive essay explaining why he is wrong. In fact, I have been known to do that in the past. But I don’t anymore because I have found that the only people whose opinions I am likely to change are the easily persuaded.

Nowadays I usually just point to the [Talk Origins Archive](http://www.talkorigins.org/). It gives intelligent people a chance to change their own opinion — and that is something that may be more likely than my changing it for them.
