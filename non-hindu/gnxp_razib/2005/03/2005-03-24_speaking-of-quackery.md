Speaking of quackery….

Over the past few days I have addressed the topic of intellectual due diligence twice, first, in a somewhat [esoteric evaluation](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003796.html) of the “situation” in cognitive science in relation to the public’s perception of paradigm acceptance within the field being at variance with the opinions of professionals, then, I moved to a more [concrete critique](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003813.html) of the abuses of facts in the service of ideology & values.

In both of these cases quibbling matters can be important indicator values of due diligence. That is, if someone uses Evolutionary Psychology as a catchall for biologistic thinking about human nature, then you need to take a step back and evaluate the knowledge base the other individual is working with. If someone makes basic errors of chronology on matters of history it is a strong clue that their knowledge base is fragmented, incoherent, and driven by their need for confirmation of their hypothesis and so warped by selection bias.

So, when someone conflates [abiogenesis](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/) and evolution, [you know they are an idiot](http://wizbangblog.com/archives/005452.php), so end the discussion. If you are inclined to expose yourself to such creatures of intellectual sloth, follow the trackbacks….
