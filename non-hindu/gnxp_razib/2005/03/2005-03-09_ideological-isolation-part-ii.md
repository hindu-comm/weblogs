Ideological Isolation, Part II

A year ago I wrote about how the books favored by the Left and the Right find little common ground in my post [Ideological Isolation,](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001813.html) which included a pretty nifty graphic, and now Kevin Drum [reports](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_03/005808.php) on a study, also with a nifty graphic, that looks at the linkage patterns of the blogosphere’s Left and Right political blogs and their respective choices for topics and focus on personalities.
