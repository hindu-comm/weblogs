Beware The Ides of March

What is it with leaders being attacked on March 15th? Today, in a surprise turn of events, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts & Sciences [passed](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=584270) a motion saying it lacked confidence in the performance of Dr. Summers. The motion was introduced by J. Lorand Matory, a professor of anthropology and African and African-American studies, (surprise surprise) and it was expected to be voted down but passed 218-185. This was the first such motion that has passed in Harvard’s 400 year history.

Hey, remember when this story first broke and we were surprised by the shitstorm that it caused because we thought people were already comfortable with gender differences. There’s no way racial differences are going to be an easier pill to swallow for these types of people. The little minds have drawn their long knives and that’s a very dangerous combination

UPDATE: [Luboš Motl](https://motls.blogspot.com/2005/03/sad-day-for-harvard.html) gives us an insider’s perspective. I particularly liked this point – “Mr. Latory, a voodoo expert and an apologist for the corrupt and brutal Nigerian dictator Ibrahim Babangida.” Hahaha.
