Organizing the Debate

There is a tremendous amount of impressive information in the Gene Expression archives. And because it’s only organized by date, it’s underutilized.

How to organize it?

The Gene Expression Textbook Project, maybe? Organize it around giving people an introduction into human biodiversity?

Maybe some sort of greatest hits list?

If we get serious about something like this, the best place on the net to look for guidance is [Talk Origins](http://www.talkorigins.org). Gene Expression is similar in that it partakes in a similar sort of debate, and could probably benefit from copying some parts of the Talk Origins organizational style.
