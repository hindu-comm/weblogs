"Divisive" Ethnic Species Names

Earlier this month, Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry altered the Latin names of three mammal species to expunge “divisive” reference to two of the country’s ethnic minorities — the Armenians and Kurds.

The Turkish red fox subspecies Vulpes vulpes kurdistanica will have its name cut down to just Vulpes vulpes, the deer Capreolus capreolus armenius will be Capreolus capreolus capreolus, and the sheep Ovis armeniana becomes Ovis orientalis anatolicus.

The Ministry’s statement alleges the names were handed out with “ill intent,” and although the official body of animal Linnean nomenclature, the [ICZN](http://www.iczn.org/), does not allow name changes for political reasons, spokespeople say this one might stick because the changes are “scientifically acceptable.”
