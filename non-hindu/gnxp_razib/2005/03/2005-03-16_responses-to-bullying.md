Responses to Bullying

Here are two contrasting approaches to the problems of schoolyard bullying. One [punishes](http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,12531079-1243,00.html) the victim and the other finds a unique way to get the message across to the bullies.

Principal Bruce Armstrong confirmed that the students had recorded the attack using a camera on a mobile phone. \[ . . . .\]

The school also suspended the Year 11 victim because he retaliated during the attack.

The victim said that after years of bullying he had decided enough was enough.

He alleged his attacker had seven years of kick-boxing training.

“He kicked me in the head, stomach, arms and legs. It went on for about 45 minutes,” the victim said.

The teenager said he had been unable to get up after the attack. His mother said his braces had been embedded in his cheek and he had suffered a black eye and cuts. \[ . . . . \]

She said it had been the second time her son had been seriously assaulted at or near the school.

Now for a breath of fresh air compared to the above idiocy of blaming the victim for defending himself against a kick-boxer take a look at this [approach](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/03/16/teacher-bully-050316.html), and you have to give the school officials credit for trying a new approach to modify the behavior of bullies. My impression is that they’ve concluded that bullies really don’t want to get in touch with their inner child, because the inner child of these child bullies is also a bully.

A teacher in a northern Manitoba town has sparked controversy by forcing students accused of bullying to wear hockey helmets bearing the slogans “loser” and “I’m stupid: I bully.”

The students, who didn’t deny they harassed another boy, were also subjected to jibes from other children during a role-playing exercise at Langruth Elementary School.

They were told to clean floors in the school in Langruth, located on the west side of Lake Manitoba. \[ . . . . . \]

“At least this teacher had the courage to say these other children shouldn’t be going home crying every day. These children, if they role-play, may learn what they’re doing to other children.”

Sutherland, who is a member of the parent advisory committee for the school, conceded that the discipline will probably make her son think twice about mocking other children in the future.

The school division said it supports the teacher’s approach to discipline, but it wouldn’t make any other comments on the case.
