The Heritability of Religiousness

Those Minnesota behavioral geneticists are at it again. Thomas Bouchard, Laura Koenig, Matt McGue and Robert Krueger have a new paper in The Journal of Personality about the heritability of religiousness that a lot of [people](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7147) have been [talking](http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000883.html) about.

Investigating the heritability of religiousness is nothing new, of course. A host of studies have found values ranging from zero in a sample of Australian men (Truett et al. 1992) to .54 in Americans (Bouchard et al. 2004) — the differences depending mostly on the age of the sample and the type of measure used for the phenotype. Its this first issue (changes with age) that Koenig et al. focused on.

They report:

When rating retrospectively, the MZ correlation for religiousness was .69, and the DZ correlation was .59. The difference between these correlations was not significant (Z=1.35, p\>.05). When rating current religiousness, however, the MZ and DZ correlations were .62 and .42, respectively, and were significantly different (Z=2.18, p[](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/3777?url=http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003777.html&thetime=%20031705&MT=true)
