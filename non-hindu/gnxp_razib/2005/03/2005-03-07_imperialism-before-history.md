Imperialism before history

About 6 months ago I refreshed my knowledge of pre-European antiquity by reading [History of the Ancient Near East](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631225528/geneexpressio-20/102-3972032-6983341?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=2025&link%5Fcode=xm2) by Marc Van De Mieroop . The most surprising aspect of this survey for me was the revelation of the expansion from Mesopotamia after 4000 BCE of a cultural complex (centered on cities) across much of the Levant and into southeast Anatolia, and, the subsequent collapse of these “colonies” in the 3rd millennium, to be replaced by indigenous high civilizations.1 Because this was a period when narrative historical records were scant we do not know the details of how and why Mesopotamians exported their culture to other urban centers in the Near East, and we also will likely never know how or why there was a distinct retrenchment after centuries of domination. With the rise of a West Eurasian information network Mesopotamian languages and motifs seem pervasive when the light of history allows some level of clarity in our perception of the past, but, the material culture never again would show such a clear stamp of Mesopotamian influence. So, with this knowledge, it is not [surprising](http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=12860) that the city-state of Mari in modern day eastern Syria might have been built by Mesopotamians to serve very specific ends, rather than being the end result of locally organic processes.

The more general and less antiquarian point is that though the ancients and moderns differ, we are united by a common nature, and common wants, impulses and cognitive tools. Without extensive written records we will never be able to put flesh upon the skeleton of the first Mesopotamian foray into cultural expansion, dare we say, imperialism? But, I suspect that we can infer that perhaps the flesh would not be different in character from what we have observed in a thousand other specific instances of human history. In the late 19th century Europeans scrambled to claim every piece of Africa, but two generations later they abandoned most of the continent within 15 years. Pulses of demographic and intellectual energy periodically seem to well up from favored locales, to wash over their neighbors, and eventually recede or sink into the substrate.2

My final point would be that in an peculiar twist a greater awareness of evolutionary psychology, and the permeation of disparate modern cultures with universal motifs, might remind many students of history that the same principles apply across time as well as space. Some of the sillier ideas about the peculiar nefariousness of Western culture and the Edenic nature of non-Western culture are easily rebutted when viewed in this intellectually synthetic light.3

1 – Such assertions are based on archeological conjecture, but nonetheless, the author seemed confident that material continuities and discontuities were rather obvious.

2 – Just as European colonial ventures changed the indigenous cultures which they dominated for generations irrevocably, so Mesopotamian culture served as a model which others retooled to their own preferences. No doubt very similar dynamics of elite emulation and demographic amalgamation played their roles….

3 – It would also help in dismissing unqualified assertions that love was “invented” by Provencal poets or that consiousness was attained first by classical Greeks.
