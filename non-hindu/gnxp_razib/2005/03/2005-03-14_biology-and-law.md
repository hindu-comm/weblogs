Biology and Law

[Understanding biological foundation of human behavior critical to improving laws](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases?id=18387)

“”The legal system tends to assume that either people are purely rational actors or that their brains are blank slates on which culture and only culture is written. The reality is much more complicated and can only be appreciated with a deeper understanding of behavioral biology,” said Vanderbilt law professor and biologist Owen Jones. He co-authored the article with Timothy Goldsmith, Yale professor emeritus of molecular, cellular and developmental biology.”  
…  
“The Columbia Law Review is one of the most prestigious scholarly journals in the legal academy. The fact that it has agreed to publish this article signals the growing legitimacy and influence of the field of law and behavioral biology,” Chris Guthrie, associate dean for academic affairs at Vanderbilt Law School, said. “We are fortunate to have the country’s leading law and behavioral biology scholar here at Vanderbilt.”
