Two Interesting Phenomena, No Data

Over at my blog, I’ve made two postings regarding interesting trends in the growth of religious minorities in two countries on the European Union’s doorstep. It seems certain that [Ukraine’s Muslims](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rfmcdpei/643982.html) are rapidly growing in number through migration; [Algerian Christians](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rfmcdpei/644810.html), while still rarer, may also be growing sharply in number, not through immigration but through conversions. Unfortunately, hard data on both situations is rare.

If anyone has any data on either situation, I’d be exceedingly grateful to see it, in the comments thread or via [private E-mail](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#02705d645d6f61666d6c636e66427b636a6d6d2c6163).
