Ancient health

It seems they found some [Shetland shit](http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/35408.html) from 3,000 years ago. The indicated diet seems to suggest no great want. Interestingly, in [Life in the Ancient Near East](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300076665/qid=1111110878/sr=1-5/ref=sr_1_5/102-3972032-6983341?v=glance&s=books) the author notes that ration records for “unfree labor” suggest a caloric intake of 3,000 per day, a healthy level. I doubt that ancient peoples had a caloric intake much below the modern mean (though they might have been shafted in the protein department if they were agriculturalists), rather, they were plagued by the variance from year to year, and in particular they were subject to periods of starvation that resulted in die offs. If the die offs are conceived of as repeated selection events, it should not surprise us when we see populations like the [Pima Indians](http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/pima/genetic/genetic.htm).
