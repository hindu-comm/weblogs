Snap

In [Individualism versus “sexual proprietariness”](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003687.html) Theresa linked to [this article](http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,344374,00.html) in Der Speigal which notes “that the percent of schoolgirls wearing headscarves in the Berlin district where Hatin was killed has gone from virtually none to about 40 percent in the past three years.” If you have read anything else about the changes in the European Muslim communities since 9/11 this should not be surprising, a new wave of “piety” signalled by “traditional” dress seems to be sweeping these enclaves as they close ranks against the perception (to some extent true) that the host societies reject them and will never accept them.

This sort of snap change in cultural norms and values within such a short period of time almost simultaneously throughout a community makes analogies to genetic or even linguistic change rather difficult when you attempt to construct plausible projections. Many models seem to posit a vertical chain of transmission (parent -\> child), but when it comes to horizontal modes (friend -\> friend) humans are as culturally promiscuous as bacteria are genetically. Those who project Muslim demographic domination of Europe within the generation and [those who rebutt it](http://www.livejournal.com/users/rfmcdpei/408410.html) are working with simplified models, but what else do they have to grasp on to? Culture defies predictive modelling as far as I can tell aside from the most trivial cases.

Consider the contrasting history of Christianity in South Korea and Japan. In 1600 \~10% of Japanese were Christians. Much of Kyushu had been Catholicized and Nagasaki was as Christian a city as 5th century Constantinople. But under Tokugawa Ieyasu Christianity was crushed to a pulp in Japan. When the nation opened itself to outsiders in the 19th century Westerners miraculously found isolated communities of “Secret Christians” who had persevered. But most of these believers had been transmuted by centuries of dissimulation, and often they turned away with a sense of alienation from the new churches founded by Westerners.1 Though some Japanese did convert to Christianity in the 19th century, by and large a second flowering of the faith did not occur. Christianity had influence far above its numbers, and there are suggestions that many female members of the imperial family converted, but in general Japan remained peculiarly a modernized and Westernized but non-Christian state. Today Japanese Christians are rather like mainline Protestants, and there are even Unitarians amongst them, you see little evidence of evangelical fervor common in other nations.

For instance, South Korea. Unlike Japan South Korea has not had a long history of Christianity, but today it is among the premier Christian nations in the world when measured in the number of missionaries in sends out. Despite the fact that only 1/4 of South Koreans are Christian! In 1945 the number was less than 5%, so the growth has been fantastic…but, according to The Korea Yearbook it seems that it levelled off in the 1990s (some estimates suggest that the rate of growth of Buddhism surpassed Christianity throughout much of the decade). Both the spectacular growth of Christianity and South Korea and the levelling off of the rate of growth in the 1990s were somewhat surprising.

The examples of South Korea and Japan both illustrate to us the reality that our understanding of human societies still remains in a pre-atomic age, they are basically magical blackboxes about which we concoct theoretically unscaffolded conjectures as we attempt to assemble alchemical formulae in reference to perceived patterns and trends, but high levels of prediction are viable only for events of the past, not for those of the future. What changed in the “Japanese soul” which made a once Christianity-receptive population rather apathetic and uninterested? Why is it that only \~1/4 of South Koreans seems to be hyperreceptive to Christianity?2

The only real lesson to be learned is greater caution. We have to utilize the few tools we have, and grandiloquent claims of insight must be tempered by the poor record of sociohistorical prognostication.

1 – One ethnography I read indicates that these remnant communities have by and large lost the battle for their continuity and many of the youth are melting into non-Christian Japanese society, which shares the same sacral motifs, though not the core belief structure.

2 – I suspect that it has to do with Christianity’s appeal to the “forward classes” of Korean society. If the modern negative correlation between high SES and birthrate holds for South Korea one might even suggest that the 25% value is metastable, as there is balance between vertical diminishment (Christians not reproducing themselves) and horizontal growth (the inflow of converts).
