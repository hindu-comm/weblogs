Euro-radical Islam

Swung by a book store where I saw a Foreign Affairs article titled [Europe’s Angry Muslims](http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050701faessay84409/robert-s-leiken/europe-s-angry-muslims.html). You can’t read it online, but that’s OK, the piece is mostly a hurried jumble of assertions. Instead, check out this report, [Bearers of Global Jihad? Immigration and National Security after 9/11](http://www.nixoncenter.org/publications/monographs/Leiken_Bearers_of_Global_Jihad.pdf), which is clearly the source of the article in Foreign Affairs. I haven’t read the whole \~150 pages, though I did jump down to the figures and data collection appendix. The point that I found unsurprising, though still concerning, is the prominence of Euro-Muslims in these jihadi movements (that is, second generation+). The unfortuante [santorum](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=santorum&f=1) of the Euro-Muslim cultural interface? Perhaps. So where’s the clean-up crew?
