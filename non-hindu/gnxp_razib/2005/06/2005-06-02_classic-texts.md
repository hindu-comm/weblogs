Classic Texts

In my post yesterday I mentioned J B S Haldane’s classic 1957 paper on The cost of natural selection.

I find that this is available as a free pdf download [here](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/). Several other classic texts are available from the same source.

As I mentioned in my post, Haldane’s conclusions have been much modified by later geneticists. It is generally agreed that natural selection can be faster than Haldane supposed, though different models produce very different results. I mention this now because I see from my Google search that Haldane’s paper is often cited by anti-evolutionists as showing that the evolution of man by natural selection is impossible.
