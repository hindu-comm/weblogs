Super-size this!

Here is the explanation of Judaism and Islam in the “devout Christian spends a month as a Muslim” episode of “30 Days”.Jews believe in the existence of one true God and are still waiting for his son, the Messiah, to save them.  
…  
\[Muslims\] base their religions on the writings of a later prophet, MuhammadLet’s start with the fact that this was a voiceover during an animated segment, in contradiction to the prohibition on figurative art that both Judaism and Islam share.

1\. Judaism does not identify the Messiah as “God’s son”.  
2. Referring to the Qur’an as the “writings” of Muhammad is technically incorrect because, according to Muslim tradition, Muhammad was illiterate, like most people of his time and setting. Moreover, the cartoon depicted him leafing through a book.
