F.D.A. Approves BiDil

The drug, which had no effect on a white control group, but reduced heart failure deaths by 43 percent for an African-American control group, [was approved by the F.D.A. as a drug for African-Americans yesterday](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/health/24drugs.html?). The New York Times reports that there was some controversy, but it appeared to be mostly between those who cared more about the lives and health of African-Americans and those who cared more about preserving [“the greater untruth”](https://print.google.com/print?id=n1HQk10xJxEC&pg=332&lpg=332&dq=guardians+of+a+greater+'untruth'&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26c2coff%3D1%26biw%3D779%26q%3Dbook%2Bnarrow%2Broads&sig=ojHoXO-FYBaG0nX6vvQRoOEK658) that genes don’t differ with ancestry:

“BiDil was endorsed last week by an F.D.A. advisory panel of outside experts. But controversy surrounded the discussions . . . critics said that endorsing a drug for one race gave official government imprimatur to the discredited notion of race as a biological category.

Several influential black political and scientific groups embraced BiDil, however, as a way to redress years of inequality in medical treatment and outcomes.”
