Brain size and intelligence

This has been around for a few months, but I didn’t catch it until now. [Big-brained people are smarter: A meta-analysis of the relationship between in vivo brain volume and intelligence](http://www.vcu.edu/uns/Releases/2005/june/McDaniel-Big%20Brain.pdf)

Abstract

The relationship between brain volume and intelligence has been a topic of a scientific debate since at least the 1830s. To address the debate, a meta-analysis of the relationship between in vivo brain volume and intelligence was conducted. Based on 37 samples across 1530 people, the population correlation was estimated at 0.33. The correlation is higher for females than males. It is also higher for adults than children. For all age and sex groups, it is clear that brain volume is positively correlated with intelligence.

The mean correlation for females appears to be .40. It’s .41 for female adults. The other numbers are .38 for male adults, .37 for female children and .22 for male children.
