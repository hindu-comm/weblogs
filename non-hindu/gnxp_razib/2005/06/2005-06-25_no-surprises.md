No surprises….

This [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/international/europe/26turkey.html) that offers that prostitution is legal in Turkey prompted me to survey the legal status of prostitution in nations which are members of the [Organization of Islamic Conference](http://www.oic-oci.org/english/main/member-States.htm). Well, Turkey is an exception, and since I used the [The World Sex Guide](http://www.worldsexguide.com/) (not work friendly!) there was little data on many countries without much sex tourism.
