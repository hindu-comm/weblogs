I am getting annoyed

Someone just forwarded me this email from Howard Metzenberg:

Razib:

You edited out the many of the comments in the Bad Science thread, including the one in which Henry says “for chris\_\_\_ Gregory, stop being so arrogant.”

It appears to me that you are not really playing the role of a neutral moderator of these forums.

Howard Metzenberg

Well Howard, the reason you can’t find that [comment](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/4078/#318063) in that thread isn’t because I deleted it, it is because it is in [another thread](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/4078/). Hey jack, for your information, I’m not even a moderator because I’m barely reading the threads in question. Now stop telling me how to run my blog.
