Stem cells in the Dar-al-Islam

Fascinating [article](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0622/p15s02-wogi.htm) in The Christian Science Monitor on the state of stem cell research in the Muslim world. This is the most surprising part for me:

Egypt will not be the first predominantly Muslim country to conduct stem-cell research. Iranian scientists developed human embryonic stem-cell lines in 2003 with the approval of Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme religious leader, says LeRoy Walters, a professor at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University in Washington.

Who’s the Great Satan doing the devil’s work now? Gives a whole new meaning to the Axis of Evil.
