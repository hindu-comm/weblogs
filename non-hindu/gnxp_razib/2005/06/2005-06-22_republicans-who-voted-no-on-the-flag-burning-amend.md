Republicans who voted "No" on the Flag Burning Amendment

Sometimes peculiar intersections can be interesting. Here are the American Conservative Union ratings of the 12 Republicans who voted against H J RES 10 (“Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing the Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States”):

|           |                |
|-----------|----------------|
| Name      | Lifetime score |
| Shadegg   | 98             |
| Flake     | 93             |
| Dreir     | 92             |
| Hoekstra  | 90             |
| Paul      | 83             |
| Petri     | 77             |
| Kolbe     | 74             |
| Ehlers    | 71             |
| Gilchrest | 64             |
| Shays     | 48             |
| Leach     | 43             |
| Schwarz   | \*             |

The only note I would make is that Ron Paul, TX, votes against basically everything (he’s an anti-federal paleolibertarian). For reference, Nancy Pelosi has a lifetime score of 3 and Tom Delay a 96.
