Please ignore mtDNA and Y chromosomal haplogroups

![Guess what, we’re related!**Credit:** [Wapondaponda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mitochondrial_eve_tree.gif)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/05/250px-Mitochondrial_eve_tree.gif?resize=250%2C207 "250px-Mitochondrial_eve_tree")

This is a public service announcement. If you are a user of direct-to-consumer personal genomics services, **please do not pay any attention to your mtDNA and Y chromosomal haplogroups.** Why? Because they hardly tell you anything about your individual ancestry. What do I mean by this? Your mtDNA comes down from your mother’s-mother’s-mother’s-mother… and similarly for your Y chromosomal lineage if you are a male. These few individuals are not any more likely to contribute to your ancestry than all those multitudes and multitudes who do not contribute to your mtDNA or Y lineages; also known as almost all your ancestors! What you should pay attention to are your autosomal results. Inferences made from most of your genome. These results may be more difficult to parse, but difficulty is no sin, and elegant ease is no virtue, in this case. That’s because you are interested in your ancestry, **not a convenient interpretable story**.

Of course I am *not* saying that mtDNA and Y chromosomal haplogroups are useless. They are useful for **population scale** phylogeography. But please don’t make inferences about yourself from one data point. At least in most cases.
