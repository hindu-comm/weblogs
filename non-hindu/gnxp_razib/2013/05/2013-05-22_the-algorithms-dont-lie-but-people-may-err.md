The algorithms don’t lie, but people may err

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the past year or so I’ve been getting queries about what I think about Eran Elhaik’s preprint on the genetic character of European Jews. I found some of the conclusions frankly a little weird, but I assumed that things would be cleaned up for publication. Well, it’s been out for a while now: [The Missing Link of Jewish European Ancestry: Contrasting the Rhineland and the Khazarian Hypotheses](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61.short). But some [reporting](https://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/176171/if-jews-are-a-race-which-one/) in *The Jewish Daily Forward* has brought the author and his detractors a bit into the spotlight. The reason is that as you can tell from the title of the author takes a position on the Khazarian origin model of Ashkenazi Jews (in favor). Here is a non-genetic take over at [GeoCurrents](http://geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/linguistic-geography/the-khazarian-hypothesis-and-the-nature-of-yiddish), the thrust of which I basically concur with.

In any case, many of the problems with the paper remain. Really it all begins and ends here:

> **Choice of Surrogate Populations** >
> As the ancient Judeans and Khazars have been vanquished and their > remains have yet to be sequenced, in accordance with previous studies > (Levy-Coffman 2005; Kopelman et al. 2009; Atzmon et al. 2010; Behar et > al. 2010), contemporary Middle Eastern and Caucasus populations were > used as surrogates. Palestinians were considered proto-Judeans because > they are assumed to share a similar linguistic, ethnic, and geographic > background with the Judeans and were shown to share common ancestry > with European Jews (Bonne´-Tamir and Adam 1992; Nebel et al. 2000; > Atzmon et al. 2010; Behar et al. 2010). Similarly, Caucasus Georgians and Armenians were considered proto-Khazars because they are believed to have emerged from the same genetic cohort as the Khazars (Polak 1951; Dvornik 1962; Brook 2006).

Elhaik’s methods and data sets are all legitimate. **But the outcome of this contest is already forgone by the nature of how he defined the rules of the game.** There are reasonable arguments for thinking that **modern Armenians may exhibit a closer genetic relationship to the Jews of Roman Antiquity, and perhaps even the Hebrews of the Persian years, than modern Palestinians.** The two primary ones being that modern Palestinians have African ancestry, and, post-Islamic Arabian ancestry. Neither of which seem trivial.

For more, this old post, [Ashkenazi Jews are probably not descended from the Khazars](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/ashkenazi-jews-are-probably-not-descended-from-the-khazars/#.UZ1IN0BDvZh), will do.
