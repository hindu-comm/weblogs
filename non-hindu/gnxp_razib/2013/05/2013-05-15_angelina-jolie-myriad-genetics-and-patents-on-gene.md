Angelina Jolie, Myriad Genetics, & patents on genes

Because of [Angelina Jolie’s](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html?hp&_r=1&) revelation, the [Myriad Genetics](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillypharma/Angelina-Jolie-breast-cancer-testing-Myriad-Genetics-and-the-Supreme-Court.html) case is in the news again. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, [look it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_Genetics#Legislation_and_Litigation). Because of the patent Myriad can charge thousands of dollars for a test which would otherwise be much cheaper (and putting it out of reach of many without health insurance). My question here is simple: **if you are a geneticist do you think Myriad’s position has any validity?** The reason I ask is that I know many geneticists, and I know many geneticists read me, and I follow many geneticists on Twitter, but I’ve never encountered one who would be willing to defend Myriad’s position as plausible and passing the smell test. If you are one of those geneticists please leave a comment, because I’m honestly curious.

I went to the talks about the Myriad case at ASHG, and I have to say it was all law, and no science. The science was confused and laughable. The panelists themselves rolled their eyes and expressed resignation as to the garbled ratiocinations of the judges who reviewed the case. There is a classic “two cultures” problem.
