Riddick-to-the-Riddick

My personal preference would have been that they somehow extend the plot line of [The Chronicles of Riddick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick). As [Brian Switek](http://brianswitek.com/) suggested this seems like [Pitch Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Black_(film)), but with much better special effects. Though how many they have left after this trailer, I donâ€™t know.
