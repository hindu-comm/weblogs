Finished J. P. Mallory’s [The Origins of the Irish](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BM9OD60/geneexpressio-20). Good book, but it was as illuminating as to the origins of the Irish as Danel Dennett’s [Consciousness Explained](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316180661/geneexpressio-20) was in explaining consciousness.
