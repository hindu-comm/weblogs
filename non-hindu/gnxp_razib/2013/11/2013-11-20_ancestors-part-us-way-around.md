Our ancestors are part us…or the other way around?

Keeping a close watch on media representations of the [new Nature paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/11/long-first-age-mankind/) on the ancient Siberian genome. Here’s *The New York Times*, [24,000-Year-Old Body Is Kin to Both Europeans and American Indians](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/science/two-surprises-in-dna-of-boy-found-buried-in-siberia.html?ref=science&_r=0&pagewanted=print). I don’t have a problem with the title, but the roll-out isn’t totally accurate in what it will connote to the audience in my opinion:

> he genome of a young boy buried at Mal’ta near Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia some 24,000 years ago has turned Tout to hold two surprises for anthropologists. >
> The first is that the boy’s DNA matches that of Western Europeans, > s**howing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed**. Though none of the Mal’ta boy’s skin or hair survive, his genes suggest he would have had brown hair, brown eyes and freckled skin. >
> The second surprise is that his DNA also matches a large proportion — > some 25 percent — of the DNA of living Native Americans. The first > people to arrive in the Americas have long been assumed to have descended from Siberian populations related to East Asians. **It now seems that they may be a mixture between the Western Europeans who had reached Siberia and an East Asian population**. >
> The Mal’ta boy was aged 3 to 4 and was buried under a stone slab > wearing an ivory diadem, a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. > Elsewhere at the same site some 30 **Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe**. The remains were excavated by Russian archaeologists over a 20-year period ending in 1958 and stored in museums in St. Petersburg.

The issue I have is that modern Europeans are a new population which emerged through admixture processes over the past \~10,000 years. And one of those populations which contributed to their ancestry are the descendants of the Siberian boy! Talking about “Western Europeans” \~20,000 years ago is geographic convenience. They wouldn’t be “Western Europeans” as we understand them genetically. Even if there wasn’t any recent admixture, \~1,000 generations of drift is not trivial. Though the archaeology may clarify, I also don’t think it is definite that the ancient Siberians were from Europe as we’d understand it. Perhaps they all come from a common Central Eurasian stock which diversified?

Not that I have a better solution for terminology.
