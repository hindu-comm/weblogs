The FDA and 23andMe

[![nap](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/nap.png?resize=200%2C54)![nap](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/nap.png?resize=200%2C54)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/11/nap.png)First, [download your 23andMe raw results *now*](https://www.23andme.com/you/download/) if you have them. If you don’t know what’s going on, the FDA has [finally started to move aggressively](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/25/23andme-fda-block/) against the firm. Unfortunately this is not surprising, as this was [foreshadowed years ago](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/did-the-fdas-jeffrey-shuren-mislead-a-congressional-hearing/). And, 23andMe has been moving aggressively to emphasize its medical, as opposed to genealogical, services over the past year. But this isn’t the story of one firm. This is the story of government response to very important structural shifts occurring in the medical delivery system of the United States. The government could potentially bankrupt 23andMe, but taking a step back that would still be like the RIAA managing to take down Napster. The information is *coming*, and if there’s one thing that can overpower state planning it is consumer demand. Unless the US government wants to ban their citizens from receiving their own genetic data they’re just putting off the inevitable outsourcing of various interpretation services. Engagement would probably be the better long term bet, but I don’t see that happening.
