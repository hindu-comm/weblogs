An introduction

For those readers who don’t know me, I’ve been around, as they say. My interests range from population genetics to the history of Near Eastern antiquity. As such you can expect about a 50/50 distribution of posts of science and non-science, though in this day and age the boundary between the two is not as clear and distinct as it used to be.
