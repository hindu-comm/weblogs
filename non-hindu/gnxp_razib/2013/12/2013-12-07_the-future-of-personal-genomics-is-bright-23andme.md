The future of personal genomics is bright. 23andMe….

[![23andMe](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/23andMe.png?resize=159%2C116)![23andMe](https://i0.wp.com/www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/23andMe.png?resize=159%2C116)](https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-only-notice/?redirect=gi9-DkE1u7LJ0uXS1ZiIeLk_8kSLBa-6tHF7lwgNMfM=)As most of you know [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-only-notice/?redirect=gi9-DkE1u7LJ0uXS1ZiIeLk_8kSLBa-6tHF7lwgNMfM=) is no longer providing health interpretation services, though they are still providing genealogy (and are unrolling a more advanced ancestry painting right now). You can still download raw data though, so you can find third party providers to calculate health risks. Unfortunately, as some have noted 23andMe actually did a rather good job outlining the probabilities. And, I think this answers the question about what 23andMe’s strategy was when it started courting FDA intervention about a year ago when it began to emphasize their health services (you probably encountered the marketing push somewhere). **There doesn’t seem to have been a master strategy with contingencies.** I obviously wish the company luck, and am hopeful it will make it through this rough patch, but they need to be on the ball from now on. For the customer base, I think it is fine to order their kits so you can get the raw data and genealogy services.
