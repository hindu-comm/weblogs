Open Thread, 9/22/2013

I found this [broadside against intellectual ignorance](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9vq3b17g) by Christoper Beckwith rather amazing and enjoyable. Long time readers will be aware that [I am a fan](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/whos-barbarian-now-empires-of-silk-road.php) of his *[Empires of the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20/)*. In any case, I have noticed that many of my friends and acquaintances use the term ‘ignorance’ to connote a set of views which they find ***normatively*** offensive. That is not my preferred usage of the term. Rather, I take it rather at its face value as denoting those who are lacking in the basic facts from which to even attempt audacious inference. The latter I appreciate. The former I detest.
