The allelomorphs of genetics

Google’s [Ngrams viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=population+genetics%2Cmolecular+genetics%2Cdevelopmental+genetics%2Cevolutionary+genetics%2Cgenomics&year_start=1930&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=4&share=) yields some interesting results when you query the mentions of various fields within genetics over the past century or so. Nothing too surprising, though I would have thought that molecular genetics would have surpassed population genetics even earlier than it did.

Note that the default settings go to 2000. But I was curious about genomics’ trajectory, and I pushed it to the max (2008). The qualitative result was not a surprise to me, but the magnitude did take me aback:
