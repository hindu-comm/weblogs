The end of Google Reader

If you read this weblog via its [RSS Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeneExpressionBlog) and Google Reader you are probably aware that you will have to stop doing this by July 1st. Here’s a [an article with links to replacements](http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/tech/web/google-reader-news). I will enter into the record that I now use [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/#latest) and I don’t miss Google Reader at all.

More from [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/24/there-is-no-google-reader-replacement-only-alternatives/).
