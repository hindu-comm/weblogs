Non-invasive first trimester testing for Down syndrome

![Fetus at \~12 weeks](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/06/Fetus_3_months-237x300.jpg?resize=237%2C300 "Fetus_3_months")

I am going to get back to the [eugenics debate](http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2013/05/the-new-eugenics-same-as-old-eugenics.html) at some point, but it is hard to motivate myself. This is due to a combination of complacency and sanguinity. Many of those who use eugenics as a “scare word” or are “very concerned about it” don’t really seem to get past generalities when it comes to the present situation (i.e., there is detailed exploration of past atrocities, and some exploration of rather unrealistic scenarios, such as occurred with the [“Chinese eugenic”](http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-project-probes-the-genetics-of-genius-1.12985) story, but little concrete engagement with realities such as the high abortion rates for positive tests for Down syndrome). In more crass and intellectually vapid discussions liberals and conservatives tend to use eugenics as a term of selectively useful instrumental rhetoric, a bludgeoning instrument only in the mindless screaming discourse.

Meanwhile, we have advances like the[whole genome sequencing of second trimester fetuses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674554). This is still basic science, but in genomics basic science is translated really fast to the consumer market. I’m \~90 percent sure my daughter will have a 10 x whole genome sequence by the end of 2014 (I might even get her parents in on the game for a trio).So, submitted for your interest are two papers on firsttrimester noninvasive screens for Down syndrome due to aneuploidies (and other syndromes). [Non-Invasive First Trimester Blood Test Reliably Detects Down’s Syndrome and Other Genetic Fetal Abnormalities](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130607085203.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29):

We did [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling). We’d rather not have to in the future. **The key is to move positive tests into the first trimester.** No matter the reality that most couples who receive a positive result in early second trimester choose to terminate, when it comes to killing a fetus every week counts. You can see what I mean when you look at how [abortions are performed as a function of fetal development](https://americanpregnancy.org/unplannedpregnancy/abortionprocedures.html). Not only that, if you read the source papers you see that the typical woman who receives these sorts of screens is 35-40 years of age, and in that case with the fertility clock ticking*every week* is of the essence.
