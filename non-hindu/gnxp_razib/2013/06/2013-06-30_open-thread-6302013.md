Open Thread, 6/30/2013

Independence Day is coming up. Very excited to celebrate with my daughter. She may be old enough not to be frightened by the noise. On the other hand I came to the conclusion a few years back that the world ***might*** not be a worse off place if the American colonies had remained colonies for a while longer (to be honest my thoughts were triggered over a decade ago when I watched [The Patriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Patriot_(2000_film)) and reflected on its misrepresentation of the British armed forces for dramatic effect).
