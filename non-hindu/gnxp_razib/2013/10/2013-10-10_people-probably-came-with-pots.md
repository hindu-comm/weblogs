People probably came with pots

No time to write about it now, but check [Science Magazine](www.sciencemag.org) this afternoon (in a few hours from this posting) for a major paper on ancient mtDNA, and the striking correlation between changes in lineage frequencies and cultures that they discovered. Turns out that when you peel back the palimpsest it is much more complicated and surprising than we’d have thought.[National Geographic](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/10/europes-early-settlers-uncovered/), which funded the project, already has a post out on it:

I hope this doesn’t lead to a new simplicity to replace the old one of no migration.
