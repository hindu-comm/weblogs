Pigmentation, phylogeny, history, and adaptation

![***SLC45A2* rs16891982 frequency**,Norton, Heather L., et al. “Genetic evidence for the convergent evolution of light skin in Europeans and East Asians.” Molecular biology and evolution 24.3 (2007): 710-722.](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/slc45a2.jpg?resize=500%2C243 "slc45a2")

![SLC24A5](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/slc24a5.jpg?resize=300%2C251 "slc24a5")

The above figure is from Norton et al.’s [Genetic Evidence for the Convergent Evolution of Light Skin in Europeans and East Asians](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/710.long). It shows that rs16891982 on the *SLC45A2* locus exhibits strong differentiation between Europe and the rest of the world. This is in contrast to*SLC24A5*, where the well known allele which differentiates Africans/East Asians from Europeans is found at very high frequencies across Western Eurasia (both my parents are homozygotes for the “European” variant; in factSLC24A5’s derived variant**is found at fractions on the order of \~50% in eastern and southern India). The ancestral allele on*SLC24A5*is very difficult to find in Europeans, it is so close to fixation for the derived variant. In contrast*SLC45A2*‘s minor allele is segregating at appreciable frequencies in places like southern Spain, and the derived allele is not fixed even in Northern Europe.

I won’t review the literature on the genomics and evolution of human pigmentation at this point. Rather, I’ll just note that it seems most of the inter-population variation is controlled by a handful of genes. It’s a polygenic trait, but just. Second, a fair amount of evidence has emerged that some of the lightening derived variants have increased in frequency only very recently (e.g., on the order of \~10,000 years). **Pigmentation is then a peculiar trait where the genetic underpinnings can give historical phylogenetic information because of the varied dates of differentiation and selective sweeps**.

Below I’ve collated results from several studies on frequencies of*SLC45A2*. I invite readers to persue them. I will say two things. First, the frequency of the “European” variant in \~140 northern Ethiopians is 0%. This is peculiar for a population which may be on the order of \~50% [West Eurasian](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/07/reconstructing-genetic-ripples-in-time-and-space/#.UgIBL5JwrSg). Second, the fraction of *SLC45A2*derived variant in South Asians coincidentally tracks the “NE Euro” percentage in [Zack Ajmal’s results](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/08/what-the-harappa-ancestry-project-has-resolved/).
