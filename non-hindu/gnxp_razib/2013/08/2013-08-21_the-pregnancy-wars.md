The pregnancy wars

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/parenting-q-a-expecting-better.jpg?resize=210%2C320 "parenting-q-a-expecting-better")![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/parenting-q-a-expecting-better.jpg?resize=210%2C320 "parenting-q-a-expecting-better")](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AEBEQUK/geneexpressio-20)I don’t currently have time to read [Emily Oster’s](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emily.oster/papers/index.html) [Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong and What YouReally Need to Know](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AEBEQUK/geneexpressio-20), but I am very excited that it came out. Having had a pregnant wife and becoming a parent has made it clear to me that **much of ‘conventional wisdom’ in regards to *both* parenting and pregnancy are socially enforced norms which have marginal empirical grounding** (this is clear when you look at the huge variation in cross-cultural expectations even in developing societies). So I’m glad that Oster is pushing this issue in a somewhat more rational and hard-headed fashion that has previously been the case (i.e., some of people who I think have good ideas about skepticism of the idea that *every* pregnancy is a medical emergency waiting to happen at any moment, also try to sell you on ‘alternative medicine’ more generally). It doesn’t help that she’s within the penumbra of University of Chicago’s [academic celebrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levitt).

But the reason I’m posting right now is that [the book’s Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AEBEQUK/geneexpressio-20) is a case in point in regards to the intersection between pregnancy and the culture wars. Of 50 reviews as of this writing 20 give it five stars, 2 give it two stars, and 28 give it 1 star!
