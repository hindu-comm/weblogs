Open Thread, 08/25/2013

Very excited that my daughter was thumbing through [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20) yesterday. Previous to this she took a fancy to Christian Meeirâ€™s [Caesar: A Biography](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046500895X/geneexpressio-20).
