The shell game of Berkeley's holistic admissions

The title refers to the basic thrust of a piece in *The New York Times*, [Confessions of an Application Reader](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/lifting-the-veil-on-the-holistic-process-at-the-university-of-california-berkeley.html?smid=fb-share&pagewanted=print). The piece ends with a paragraph like so:

> **Underrepresented minorities** still lag behind: about 92 percent of > whites and Asians at Berkeley graduate within six years, compared with > 81 percent of Hispanics and 71 percent of blacks. A study of the > University of California system shows that 17 percent of underrepresented minority students who express interest in the sciences graduate with a science degree within five years, compared with 31 percent of white students.

You may or may not agree with this particular type of admissions policy (I do not, because I do not care if minorities are underrepresented at universities if that underrepresentation is due to transparent academic deficiencies, which I believe to be the case). **Rather, I want to focus on the term ‘underrepresented minorities’ and ascertain how underrepresented minorities truly are at Berkeley.** That’s easy enough to do. About \~80% of UC Berkeley undergraduates are California residents. The [Census](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) allows us to query the racial makeup of a range of age brackets for various localities. What I did was look for the percentage of individuals between the ages of 15-19 in the 2010 Census for California, approximately the source population of students who are freshman in the 2012 class.

Here are the percentages in the 15-19 age category in 2010:

30% Non-Hispanic White  
6.5% Non-Hispanic Black  
11% Non-Hispanic Asian  
48% Hispanic

Comparing to UC Berkeley’s [student data](http://opa.berkeley.edu/statistics/enrollmentData.html) Non-Hispanic Whites are nearly perfectly represented (though they are underrepresented in freshman admits, making up for it in transfers). Hispanics are represented at 1/3 the proportion you’d expect, and Blacks at about 1/2. The unsurprising reality is **individuals Asian ethnicity are overrepresented.** The Berkeley website attempts to elide and obfuscate this obvious reality by disaggregating the Asian ethnicities. But it also allows one to compare to the Census data on these ethnicities.

|-------------|------------|-------------|-------|
|             | California | UC Berkeley | Ratio |
| Chinese     | 3.4        | 21.2        | 6.2   |
| Filipino    | 3.2        | 2.6         | 0.8   |
| Japanese    | 0.7        | 1.6         | 2.3   |
| Korean      | 1.2        | 5.4         | 4.5   |
| South Asian | 1.4        | 8.1         | 5.8   |
| Vietnamese  | 1.6        | 3.4         | 2.1   |



A few notes. I assumed that Indian American is a good proxy for South Asian (in California it almost certainly is, as 90% or more South Asians probably are Indian). Second, I’m comparing against the whole population. Unlike Hispanics Asians are not that young-skewed (their fertility is lower than Non-Hispanic Whites), but because they are an immigrant community they are not as old-skewed as Non-Hispanic Whites. A quick scan shows that there is variation among Asian groups.

Finally, I decided to revisit the ethnic proportions at the various [UC campuses](http://www.cpec.ca.gov/StudentData/StudentSnapshot.ASP?DataReport=UCEth). Taking all the undergraduates, and removing international students and those who refuse to provide racial information, here are the proportions on each campus:

|               |       |                 |              |          |        |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Institution   | Black | Native American | Asian/Pac Is | Filipino | Latino |
| Berkeley      | 4     | 1               | 42           | 4        | 14     |
| Davis         | 3     | 1               | 38           | 4        | 16     |
| Irvine        | 3     | 1               | 49           | 8        | 17     |
| Los Angeles   | 5     | 1               | 37           | 5        | 18     |
| Merced        | 8     | 1               | 26           | 7        | 37     |
| Riverside     | 8     | 0               | 36           | 6        | 32     |
| San Diego     | 2     | 1               | 50           | 5        | 15     |
| Santa Barbara | 4     | 1               | 17           | 3        | 24     |
| Santa Cruz    | 3     | 1               | 21           | 4        | 22     |



The main thing that surprised me is that while Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz have reputations as schools for White kids, they actually have many Latinos as well. Though I have no idea if these are ‘White Hispanics,’ especially children of [mixed-marriages](http://www.starpulse.com/Actresses/Kerns,_Joanna/) who are putting down their more advantageous identity despite being functionally Non-Hispanic White in social contexts.
