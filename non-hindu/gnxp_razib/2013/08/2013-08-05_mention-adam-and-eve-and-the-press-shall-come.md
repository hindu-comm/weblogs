Mention Adam and Eve, and the press shall come

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png?resize=245%2C116 "God2-Sistine_Chapel")![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png?resize=245%2C116 "God2-Sistine_Chapel")](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/08/God2-Sistine_Chapel.png)There were two papers in *Science* which came out on the Y chromosome, [Sequencing Y Chromosomes Resolves Discrepancy in Time to Common Ancestor of Males Versus Females](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6145/562.abstract) and [Low-Pass DNA Sequencing of 1200 Sardinians Reconstructs European Y-Chromosome Phylogeny](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6145/565.abstract). I can recommend what [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2013/08/new-papers-on-human-y-chromosome.html) had to say, and I wasn’t going to comment until I saw this egregious piece in *The New Scientist*: [Arabian flights: Early humans diverged in 150 years](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23988-arabian-flights-early-humans-diverged-in-150-years.html#.Uf9eAZJwrSg). Because of the title I did not initially think that this had anything to do with the Y chromosome, but it turns out that the piece uses the finding that three primary non-African haplogroups diverged in rapid succession from each other as the hook for the headline. In fact not only does the Y not offer definitive accounts of human history, it doesn’t even necessarily tell us about the history of men. It’s a marker, not a time machine. To repeat: **the history of a specific genetic locus *is not the history of a population*.** It has to be said.
