Visualizing genetic variation

Iâ€™ve been thinking about how best to visualize PCA/MDS type of results, which allow for the two dimensional representation of genetic variation. Below are a few of my efforts with a data set I have. You can see the individuals in gray, but also ellipses which cover \~95% of the distribution of a given population.

Please click the images for a larger version. They represent coordinate 1 on the y axis and 2 on the z axis derive from a multidimesional scaling representing identity by state across individuals.
