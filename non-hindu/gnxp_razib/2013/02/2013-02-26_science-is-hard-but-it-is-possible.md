Science is hard, but it is possible

Again, [Chagnon, Sahlins, and science](https://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2013/02/chagnon-sahlins-and-science.html):

If you have an > ideological axe to grind, either leave scholarship and go into > politics, or else find ways to achieve a level of scholarly > objectivity in your research and writing.

For various reasons cool detachment is harder in anthropology, nor should it always be employed. But the pretense and striving for detachment is an essential part of science (coupled with curiosity and passion about the subject of interest). A [counterpoint can be found](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/noble-savages-right-method-wrong-results-right-enemies/#comment-812364331) in the comments below:

I understand you don’t have > the time to do so, but if that’s the case why take the time to write about something in the lack of anything to base it on? What you describe as politics is a reflection of ethical concerns which are fundamental to anyone doing research on human subjects. >
> Anyone doing research on human subjects has an absolute ethical > obligation to avoid harming those subjects in the course of their > research. Anthropology is different in that we work with communities, > and not individuals – so our ethnical obligation is to the communities > we study. As I understand it, medical researchers are focused on > avoiding harm while gathering data from their research subjects, not > when they publish their findings. For anthropologists, we need to be > aware of what we publish as well. So, for example, if I’ve gathered information on people committing crimes, I can’t publish it – it doesn’t matter that I didn’t harm them while observing those crimes, exposing a group as involved in  
> criminal activities can bring negative consequences on them. >
> How and what we write about people can matter sometimes – although > most of the time it doesn’t, because most people are content to ignore > us. So, for example, descriptions of Arab culture in Patel’s The Arab > Mind were used to rationalize certain kinds of torture that the US > army and intelligence agencies practiced on Muslim detainees. Anthropological studies of indigenous groups in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were used by the US military and intelligence in pursuing their war against Vietnam. >

The idea > that scientists should just do empirical research on marginalized > communities and not worry about the political effects of that research > on those communities is not “apolitical”, it is elevating the interests of scientists as a group over the communities they study. Thats a political commitment which is antithetical to any human science. >

That said, the problem many anthropologists have against Chagnon’s work has to do with ethics and methodology. Dismissing them as mere politics ignores issues which are key concerns in any human science. >

My [response](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/noble-savages-right-method-wrong-results-right-enemies/#comment-812448440) was not particularly polite. I don’t feel I have to be polite to people who I feel misrepresent my views (in short, after accusing me of not knowing anthropology, they proceed to assume they know my own take on assorted subtle issues, likely by simply inserting their “naive positivist” straw-man). The major takeaway **that objectivity may be hard, and it may be impossible in the absolute sense, but it is something we should aim for.** Additionally, just because scientific study entails ethical choices, **it does not mean that *those who disagree with your ethical choices necessarily reject the idea that ethics should inform and shape science*.** Some anthropologists seem to find it impossible to comprehend that those who don’t agree with their particular vision and implementation of social justice don’t necessarily then support the proposition that the study of humans can be analogized to impersonal billiard balls. Scholars who study cultural diversity have no familiarity with sincere intellectual diversity of perspective. Perhaps more anthropologists should do research among natural scientists, and see the reality that somehow progress in understanding occurs despite human frailties of bias, self-interest, and lack of just desserts.
