Two words: Napoleon Chagnon

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/02/chag.jpg?resize=205%2C302 "chag")![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2013/02/chag.jpg?resize=205%2C302 "chag")](https://www.amazon.com/Noble-Savages-ebook/dp/B006VJN2FE/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)Just pre-ordered a [Kindle Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Noble-Savages-ebook/dp/B006VJN2FE/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1) of [Napoleon Chagnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Chagnon)‘s new book [Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes — the Yanomamo and the Anthropologists](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684855100/geneexpressio-20). I didn’t even know this was coming out next week, but *The New York Times Magazine* has a piece up, [The Indiana Jones of Anthropology](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/napoleon-chagnon-americas-most-controversial-anthropologist.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print), which chronicles the controversial the life & times of Chagnon. My [previous](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/jared-diamond-at-the-anthropologists/#.URuL8aUqaSp) [posts](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/against-the-cultural-anthropologists/#.URuL76UqaSp) about [cultural anthropology](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/02/understanding-culture/#.URuL6qUqaSo) were written with no knowledge about the impending publication of this article, or Napoleon Chagnon’s memoir. But the timing is fortuitous. One complaint by rightfully enraged cultural anthropologists (I didn’t deny that I was attacking their profession in the most extreme terms) is that I didn’t really offer an argument. As I said, the reason is that life is short and I’m not interested in convincing anyone.

But here’s a section of the article above which reflects just what I was alluding to:

> The A.A.A.’s El Dorado task force was the most ambitious investigation > to date but was undermined by a lack of due process. The group went so > far as to interview Yanomami in Venezuela but, according to Chagnon, > failed to give him an opportunity to respond to its verdicts. As > Gregor and Gross put it, what the inquiry most clearly demonstrated was not Chagnon’s guilt or innocence but rather **anthropology’s “culture of accusation,” a “tendency within the discipline to attack its own methods and practitioners.”** >
> At least one task-force member had doubts about the exercise. In April > 2002, shortly before the group released its report, Jane Hill, the > task force’s chairwoman and a former president of the A.A.A. wrote an > e-mail to a colleague in which she called **Tierney’s book “just a > piece of sleaze**, that’s all there is to it (some cosmetic language > will be used in the report, but we all agree on that).” Nevertheless, > she said, the A.A.A. had to act: anthropologists’ work with indigenous > groups in Latin America “was put seriously at risk by its accusations,” and “silence on the part of the A.A.A would have been interpreted as either assent or cowardice. **Whether we’re doing the right thing will have to be judged by posterity.”**

Again, this doesn’t prove anything. But it isn’t as if the perception that cultural anthropology tends to eat its own came out of a vacuum. Personally I find the behavior of Jane Hill even more disturbing. Is it truly the case that on occasion an innocent man must die so that we should respect the law?

Ultimately I have to admit that over the years I’ve been a lot less sure about the evolutionary framework that Napoleon Chagnon works within. Not because I reject evolutionary frameworks, but because the devil is in the details of the logic and data. Chagnon is right, evolution needs to be brought into the discussion. But if so, it has to be done subtly and with due respect for the complexity of the topic. Shouting “Nazi!” is only going to distract from the hard working of figuring the shape of reality.
