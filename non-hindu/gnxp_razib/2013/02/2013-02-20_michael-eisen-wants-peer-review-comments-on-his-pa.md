Michael Eisen wants peer review comments on his paper

This is great, [Please review our new paper: Sequencing mRNA from cryo-sliced Drosophila embryos to determine genome-wide spatial patterns of gene expression](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1304):

> It’s no secret to people who read this blog that I hate the way > scientific publishing works today. Most of my efforts in this domain > have focused on removing barriers to the access and reuse of published > papers. But there are other things that are broken with the way > scientists communicate with each other, and chief amongst them is > pre-publication peer review. I’ve written about this before, and won’t > rehash the arguments here, save to say that I think we should publish first, and then review. But one could argue that I haven’t really practiced what I preach, as all of my lab’s papers have gone through peer review before they were published. >
> No more. From now on we are going to post all of our papers online > when we feel they’re ready to share – before they go to a journal. > We’ll then solicit comments from our colleagues and use them to > improve the work prior to formal publication.[Physicists and > mathematicians have been doing this for decades](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/www.arxiv.org), as have an[increasing number of biologists](http://haldanessieve.org/). It’s time for this to become standard practice. >
> Some ground rules. I will not filter comments except to remove obvious > spam. You are welcome to post comments under your name or under a pseudonym – I will not reveal anyone’s identity – but I urge you to use your real name as I think we should have fully open peer review in science. >
> OK. Now for the paper, which is posted > on[arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4693)and can be linked to, cited there. We also have a copy[here](http://www.michaeleisen.org/docs/Combs_Slicing.pdf), in case you’re having trouble with figures on arXiv. >
