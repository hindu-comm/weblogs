The age of non-invasive pre-natal testing is here

Last summer [Neuroskeptic](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2012/07/coming-age-of-fetal-genomics.html) posted on [The Coming Age of Fetal Genomics](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2012/07/coming-age-of-fetal-genomics.html). It seems likely to me that this “age” won’t be ushered in with a bang, but we’ll be there before we know it. After all, **most people aren’t thinking about having children at any given moment, and don’t track biomedical advances in genetic disease screening until they’re crossing that bridge.** Over at [Xconomy](http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/02/20/natera-enters-four-way-competition-with-new-prenatal-genetic-test/) Luke Timmerman has a post up, [Natera Joins Quest in Four-Way Battle for Prenatal Genetic Tests](http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/02/20/natera-enters-four-way-competition-with-new-prenatal-genetic-test/). Here are some important details:

> …The company uses the same basic instrument to analyze DNA—Illumina’s > HiSeq—but it has been tailored differently to look for about **20,000 > different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mom’s blood > sample.** The workflow is pretty simple—a clinician takes a blood sample from the mom, it gets shipped to Natera’s centralized lab in San Carlos, CA, and results are sent back to the physician and patient in two weeks. >
> … >
> After meeting with executives from all four major players in the non-invasive prenatal genetic testing market, and many physicians at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine meeting, **JP Morgan analyst Tycho Peterson wrote that the market appears poised to take off.** >
> “In stark contrast to just a few years ago, NIPT \[non-invasive > prenatal genetic testing\] is now widely understood and used by the > maternal-fetal medicine community, which tends to be an early adopter > of new technology and often sees high-risk patients,” Peterson wrote > in a note to clients Feb. 18. Still, **he cautioned there are “widely divergent views” among physicians about the appropriate use of the technology**, particularly on whether it should be expanded beyond high-risk pregnancies and into more mainstream usage.

For readers of this weblog who are interested in this sort of thing I think the key to note is that **it doesn’t matter what your doctor’s views are, just find a doctor who will align themselves with your views.** You’re paying for it, and you are going to raise your children, not them.

And by the way, 20,000 SNPs is a decent amount to work with if you got the raw data. It would be good enough probably for inferring the identity-by-descent from various grandparents and such.
