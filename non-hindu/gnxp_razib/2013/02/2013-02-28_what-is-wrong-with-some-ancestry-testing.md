What is wrong with some ancestry testing

This is an example of the type of question I receive all the time:

Here is some [genetic analysis of Somalis from yours truly](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/06/a-genomic-sketch-of-the-horn-of-africa/). I don’t necessarily blame the public here, as the marketing of Y and mtDNA lineages has really gotten out of control recently. The problem is that the fine print that Y and mtDNA follow **only one** direct line of descent is usually there. But, it is accompanied by rich visual and narrative media that tells a story about that marker, and it is this that is salient for most. Not that the story being told is only a very small part of the overall epic cycle that is your genealogy.

(Also, in population genetics using the word [“Caucasian”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/stop-using-the-word-caucasian-to-mean-white/) is really confusing. [G2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_G-M201_(Y-DNA)) can often be thought of as a Caucasian haplogroup, but I don’t think that that’s what my correspondent meant)
