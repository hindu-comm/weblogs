Visualizing European genetic variation: looking at dimensions which aren't so boring

Yesterday I re-ran Plink with a narrower European-biased data set, and generated some MDS plots. I only had a few Asian and African populations, mostly so that I could replicate the standard dimensions 1 and 2, producing the classic “v-shape” which you’ve seen before. But what’s more interesting are lower coordinates. They may not capture as much of the variation in the distance matrix, but illustrate important dynamics. I haven’t used the directlabels package yet, so right now the labels are still imperfect. I’m giving black text as well as colored text. Also, here’s the original [data](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8Tdg8RZEWOOQjZXNXlqejg0VU0/edit?usp=sharing)(as in MDS results, not the raw data).
