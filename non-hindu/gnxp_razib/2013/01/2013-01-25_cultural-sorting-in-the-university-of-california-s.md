Cultural sorting in the University of California system

My question is simple: **why so few Asians at University of California Santa Barbara**? Freshman [admissions profiles](http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses/index.html) are easy enough to get for the UC system, while Ron Unz has put his [demographic data online](http://www.ronunz.org/university-racial-ethnic-enrollment-1980-2011/?School=university+of+california&Search=Search). For what it’s worth 27 and 9 percent of the children in the [California educational system](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/cb/cefstudentracecomp.asp) (primary and secondary) were non-Hispanic white and Asian in 2010-2011.

My impression is that Santa Barbara is relatively weak in the sciences in comparison to an equivalent school like Irvine. Note that at four of the UC’s non-Hispanic whites are *underrepresented*, using the source population profiles as the benchmark (and in fact, if I limited it to just 18 year olds, a cohort which probably has more than 27 percent non-Hispanic whites, then they may be underrepresented at a few other campuses).
