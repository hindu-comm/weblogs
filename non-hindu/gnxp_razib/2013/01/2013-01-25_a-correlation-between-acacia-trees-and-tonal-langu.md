A correlation between acacia trees and tonal languages?

At [A Replicated Typo](http://replicatedtypo.com/most-important-paper-on-cultural-evolution-that-includes-acacia-trees-published/5870.html), [Most important paper on cultural evolution that includes acacia trees published](http://replicatedtypo.com/most-important-paper-on-cultural-evolution-that-includes-acacia-trees-published/5870.html). The lessons here can be generalized obviously:

> Last month saw the publication of a paper by James and I (our first > paper!) on the so-called ‘nomothetic’ approach to links between > language structure and social structure. In it we review the recent > trend of using large-scale cross-cultural statistical analyses to find > links between cultural traits and social structures (e.g. Lupyan & > Dale, 2010). We show that statistical tests can be misleading because > of the nature of cultural systems. **We also argue that using > statistics alone does not provide strong explanatory power.** However, > they can be a valuable part of a pluralistic approach to problems – > especially generating hypotheses and as a catalyst for debate. Other > approaches can help support the suggestions made by nomothetic > studies, such as experiments and models.

The paper is open access, [Social Structure and Language Structure: the New Nomothetic Approach](http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/plc.2012.16.issue-2/v10057-012-0008-6/v10057-012-0008-6.xml?format=INT).
