Laura Hercher convinces me there is no non-self interested case for genetic paternalism

Over at [David Dobbs’](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/the-case-for-paternalism-in-genetic-testing/) weblog [Laura Hercher](https://twitter.com/laurahercher) has a [guest post](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/the-case-for-paternalism-in-genetic-testing/) up with the heading [The Case for Selective Paternalism in Genetic Testing](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/the-case-for-paternalism-in-genetic-testing/). Here are some relevant sections:

Actually, I don’t think that’s paternalism. Hercher’s whole post is bathed in a sentiment of protective paternalism, but there’s really little concrete response and rejection of the positions of those of us who lean toward greater information dissemination. In fact I’m even more convinced that genuine defenders of a paternalistic position are acting out of [arrogance and self-interest](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/10/doctors-are-apparently-gods-get-used-to-it/#.UPZL4FQR-So). Their arguments are qualitatively different from the ones that Hercher offers above.

Unlike many people I am willing to cop to the reality that most people are quite stupid and ignorant. In fact, I would class all of the human race aside from analytical engines like [Ed Witten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten) in this category. But on a finer scale 25% of American don’t read any books in a given year, and individuals with undergraduate degrees in genetics can be under the mistaken impression that ancestral information is encoded *only* in the Y and mtDNA, rather than the whole genome (true story!). But this widespread ignorance and stupidity is one reason that I favor open access to genetic information: many ‘gatekeepers’ are no more well informed. Additionally, in a world of probiotics and nutritional supplements holding genetic information back in the interests of the public’s health due to their credulity strikes me as like holding back the waters of a cracking dam with one’s fingers. Rather than censor or cordon the information off, better ways have to be developed to appropriately communicate the information to the public. Understanding is an important good, but more critically in the area of health people just need to make the choices most optimal for them.

The example of [Huntington’s disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington's_disease) is I think an important one, as it reiterates the importance of professionals who can facilitate the flow (or lack thereof if the possible patients so choose!) of information. As Americans we can buy and sell our own stocks, but often people rely on intermediaries and specialists. There’s no mandate, but it is often a mark of seriousness to consult experts. Granted, there will always be those who foolishly plunge headlong into adventures without any competence, but such as it always has been.

**Addendum:** I am actually more open to paternalism than you might think. **But paternalism has be expressed and implemented on a macrosocial level.** Until that happens I am curious why people would want to make exceptions for the ideal of self-actualizing individualism in the cases DNA is at issue.
