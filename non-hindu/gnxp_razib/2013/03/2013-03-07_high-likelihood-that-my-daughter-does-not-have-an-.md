High likelihood that my daughter does not have an autosomal dominant condition

After my [previous](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/03/your-health-is-your-health/) post my wife started doing research online. The autosomal dominant condition that I have is almost certainly localized to one particular chromosome (there is a large effect QTL there that is strongly associated with my condition). Additionally, **I inherit this condition from my mother.** My daughter has her whole pedigree genotyped, thanks to 23andMe. My wife went into the [Family Inheritance](https://www.23andme.com/you/inheritance/) feature, **and compared the identity by descent blocks shared between my mother and my daughter.** And, it turns out that on that chromosome the only segments inherited from me, her father, come from my father. Ergo, **she can not have inherited the autosomal dominant condition from my mother, since she did not inherit those alleles from her!**

We are very happy right now. This is one reason I don’t really [care about what the F.D.A. thinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-m2Cucdoo) about direct-to-consumer personal genomics. We’re talking about commodity technology. And no one is going to stand between you and your health, if you are motivated.

**Addendum:** With hindsight I could have figured this out myself a year ago. It just hadn’t crossed my mind.
