Never speak "ill" of Fisher!

A. Fisher. This was a moderately dangerous move on my part because many of Fisher‚Äôs views have been transmitted only through later researchers, who may have lacked a clear understanding of what Fisher himself was trying to say. Heap on top of that the reality that the debate between Fisher and Sewall Wright was often abstruse for the evolutionary biologists who nevertheless managed to take sides and transmit their understandings of the conflict, and it‚Äôs a recipe for misrepresentation. With that in mind let me enter into the record an email from a friend who has engaged in a deep reading of Fisher, and attempted to understand his reasoning (no, this is **not** [A. W. F. Edwards](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-awf-edwards.php)!):

> I‚Äôve complained about this kind of thing to you before, so I don‚Äôt suppose I‚Äôll make much headway now. But let me try again. üôÇ Allow me to quote Warren Ewens: >

Wright‚Äôs > view of evolution focused on subdivided subpopulations and an > ‚Äúadaptive topography‚Äù in which populations moved so as steadily to > increase mean fitness, except for rare occasions where random changes > in gene frequency lead to temporary decreases in mean fitness as the > population crosses a valley in the adaptive topography in moving from > one peak to another.

Fisher was strongly influenced in > his formulation by the argument that mating is not necessarily random, > that the average excess and the average effect are not necessarily > equal, that genotype frequencies are thus not necessarily in > Hardy-Weinberg proportions, and that the total change in W can be > negative. This was central to his viewpoint and the [Fundamental Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection) was an attempt to achieve a partial result in this generally complex picture.* >
> Two ironies arise from this.

Thus in his last > paper Wright (1988) says: ‚ÄúThe effects \[on gene frequencies in an > adaptive topography\] may be calculated using Fisher‚Äôs ‚ÄòFundamental Theorem of Natural Selection‚Äô.‚Äù It is clear that Fisher never got his interpretation of the theorem across to Wright, **or almost anyone else.**\[My emphasis -Razib\] >
> The second has been pointed out to me by Steven Frank (personal > communication). This is, in Frank‚Äôs words, that ‚ÄúWright, who was so > interested in gene interactions and inbreeding, insisted on a > formulation that cannot work when gene interactions are present, > whereas Fisher, who is usually regarded as a single-locus > panselectionist, insisted strongly on formulations that took account > of inbreeding and interactions‚Äù. This is a fascinating and ironical insight, since it demonstrates a real reversal of the generally perceived positions of Fisher and Wright, and of the generally perceived central features of their evolutionary theories.

I suppose the legend of Fisher‚Äôs views, in particular for many American biologists who have received a ‚ÄúWrightian‚Äù story, resembles our ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù Herbert Spencer‚Äôs views of [‚ÄúSocial Darwinism‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism#Social_Darwinists) (which owes more to [Richard Hofstadter‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hofstadter) treatment of the movement). The legend is strong enough that I keep forgetting the complexity of the truth. Not enough to make me a post-modernist, but a cautionary tale.
