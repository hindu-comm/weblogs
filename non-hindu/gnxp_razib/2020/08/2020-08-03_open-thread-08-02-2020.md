B. S. Haldane](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07ZTS751R/geneexpressio-20). I actually found out about this book via [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/books/review/a-dominant-character-haldane-samanth-subramanian.html), which reviewed this. Unless you have been sleeping under a rock, Haldane, along with R. A. Fisher and Sewall Wright, was instrumental in fusing population genetics with the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis in the English-speaking world. Fisher has a biography, [R.A. Fisher: The Life of a Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471093009/geneexpressio-20), as does Wright, [Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684733/geneexpressio-20).

The three differed in various ways. But I think it is clear that Haldane was the most “interesting” when it came to his personal and political life. Perhaps most interesting from the viewpoint of moderns is that Haldane and Fisher were scientific confederates, despite the two being cultural and political opposites. For much of his life, Haldane was a Marxist, while Fisher was a conservative.

It’s a good book. I think I’ll talk about the character of Luther at some point in a blog post. But I have also come to the conclusion **that I need to stop reading books about the Reformation.** I’ve been reading about this period since I was 20, and I think I have now reached a point where everything new is old, and unless I plan on becoming a scholar in this area (I don’t), I’m not going to be learning that pushes my insights on the margin.

Spencer covers a lot of the geology and biogeography, while I review again the new preprint on Denisovans, Hobbits, and the Luzon hominins. I encourage you guys to give this one a listen, as I’m quite proud of it. Spencer makes a prediction that will shock you! (well, perhaps not totally, but it’s worth a listen)

While you are at it, **please consider rating the podcast on Apple** (or Stitcher, I don’t know how it works on Spotify). We’ve kind of plateaued in the mid-2000s for a while. More listeners have been showing up since the [Tides of History](https://podcasts.apple.com/jm/podcast/genetics-transformation-prehistory-interview-spencer/id1257202425?i=1000470281698) guest spot, but I get the sense they’re casual listeners.
