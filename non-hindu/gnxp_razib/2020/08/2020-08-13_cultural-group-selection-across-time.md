Cultural group selection across time

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/culturalevolution.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/culturalevolution.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226520447/geneexpressio-20)Recently there was a discussion on Twitter in regards to group selection, and I made a few comments which I think should be familiar to readers of this weblog, but as I delete all my tweets I will repeat some of the things I said there here.

First, “group selection” brackets a lot of phenomena, but I’ll focus on inter-demic selection. This is basically a situation where you have two groups, and they are competing. Biologically the competition between groups is not sufficient. There needs to be heritable between-group variance, and, the selection on that variance. If you know some biology or evolution this is clear, but if you do not it may sound opaque. What I’m getting at here is that if two groups are genetically exactly the same, group selection by definition cannot happen, because there is no average difference between the groups genetically. In contrast, selection can still occur, because the two groups may still have a lot of heritable variation.

The problem with inter-demic selection is that in many biological circumstances, in particular with humans and other large organisms that migrate and move, is that between-group variance is often very low. Most of the time neighbors are not that genetically distinct. In population genetics, a stylized fact is that very little migration is needed to prevent genetic divergence between groups (1 migrant per generation).

So when biologists express skepticism of group selection, in humans or any organism that’s not highly partitioned, this is why. Readers of this weblog surely know that Fst in Central Germany during the Neolithic was \~0.10 between hunter-gatherers and farmers. This is about the Fst between modern Northern Europeans and Chinese. So a great opportunity for group selection, right? The problem is that 90% of the variance is still not partitioned between groups, so you need **very strong group-level selection** for this to make a difference.

There is just way more gene-flow as sharp distinctions collapsed during the Holocene. If biological group selection did occur in humans, it was much more likely during the Pleistocene, where marriage networks seemed more viscous.

But, and there is a but, **this does not mean that cultural group selection may not be ubiquitous during the Holocene.** The reason goes back to the variation: **cultures can vary mostly between groups, rather than within them.** That means group selection has a lot of “heritable variation” to work with in this case. For example, linguistic variation is mostly between groups, not within them. The rise of shibboleths and various markers can cause sharp differences quickly and they can be quite permanent in a life history scale (e.g., scarification).

Was cultural group selection stronger or weaker during the Pleistocene or Holocene? My intuition is that the more rapid pace of cultural evolution over time tracks stronger and intensifying inter-group competition. In other words, group selection increased, at least initially. Peter Turchin argues that warfare was most extreme during the Neolithic, not the period after or before. Perhaps this is when inter-group violence was most extreme?
