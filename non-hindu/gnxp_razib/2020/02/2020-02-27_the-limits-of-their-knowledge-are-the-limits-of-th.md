The limits of their knowledge are the limits of their world

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chungkuo.jpeg?resize=175%2C287&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chungkuo.jpeg?resize=175%2C287&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440207614/geneexpressio-20)Back in the 1990s I read David Wingrove’s [Chung Kuo](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440207614/geneexpressio-20) series of future history science fiction.\* Set in the year 2200, Wingrove depicts a world in which China is not only ascendant but in some ways the world ***is*** China.

For me, an implausible “twist” is that the political and cultural elite of this period falsified history. In this future history, the past 2,000 years has been erased from memory. China under the Han dynasty expanded westward under leaders such as [Ban Chao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Chao) and conquered the Roman Empire. Organized and institutional religion (Christianity and Buddhism), the rise of the West, and eventually the decline of China, never happened. Within the series itself, the rulers know the real history. Additionally, through a process of investigation and deeper analysis, bright individuals can also piece together the past. But the vast majority of humanity is totally unaware that only a few centuries ago the world was radically different.

I have come to understand that most people do not engage in active critical-rationalism. Rather, they look to authorities from whom they can receive enlightenment, or be initiated into esoteric truths. For them, history is not a set of facts and processes about the past, but a narrative and framework which is a handmaid to an ideological project.

The examples are legion. The American Founders were white supremacists. The American Founders were devout Christians. The American Founders were radical progressives. The truth of the matter of these claims is less important than the symbolic value of the idea of who the American Founders were. The truth is secondary to the utility of the message.

This has always been, and will always be. What I am less sure of is whether today people are more ignorant of the past, or, if more people feel confident in expressing opinions about the past despite little solid knowledge about the past. Either way, this is concerning, because the truth is a critical antidote to totalitarian temptations. A smugly ignorant populace is manipulable populace.

\* The original publisher gave up on the series after book seven, and Wingrove wrote a hasty and bizarre eight novel to complete the series. More recently has been rewriting the series to give in a more definitive conclusion.
