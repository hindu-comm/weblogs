Some people take my own recommendations to heart. I take Peter’s options to heart (Peter was the one who suggested [Strange Parallels](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZKNRFN/geneexpressio-20) to me).

[New Atheism: The Godlessness That Failed](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/30/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed/). I’ve talked to several people who were strident New Atheists \~2010 who are now disillusioned with the direction most “secular” people have taken in the USA. In fact, some admit to having more sympathy and fellow feeling for religious traditionalists, because they simply can’t keep track of the latest “woke” orthodoxy.

I haven’t said much about coronavirus because I don’t know much more than you. I think the risk is real, but probably not Black Death real. It seems pretty likely we’ll have serious economic adjustments to make. It seems pretty likely we’ll have a worldwide pandemic and serious loss of life. But probably not socially destabilizing in most cases. This is kind of on my mind because I noticed that people have started “prepping” through my Amazon affiliates. That’s how I know [“Whole Egg Product”](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0156QY4R2/geneexpressio-20) gives you 50,000 nonperishable calories for \$189.

This is the only explanation why someone purchased hundreds of dollars worth of [spam with bacon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005VH6GQO/geneexpressio-20) recently.

[Gotye’s *Somebody I Used to Know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgvwIQfNCPo) if it was a 1980s video. Pretty impressive. I thought perhaps they made an alternative video, but it’s actually a reworking of some random clips.

[Influence of Genetic Ancestry on Human Serum Proteome](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30016-1).

Spencer and I recorded an episode as guests on [Tides of History](https://wondery.com/shows/tides-of-history/). It should drop in April. In case you didn’t notice, we’re up to episode 8 on [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) for season three. We’ll be releasing one on the genetics of ancient Egypt at some point soon.

[Framing the Early Middle Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006SF3M5G/geneexpressio-20) is a very good book. A bit of a core dump and the author is going to fit everything into his materialist/Marxist framework, but that’s OK.

[‘It’s Pretty Brutal’: The Sandwich Generation Pays a Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/parenting/sandwich-generation-costs.html?algo=als1_desk_filter&fellback=false&imp_id=485198952&imp_id=806969987&action=click&module=editorsPicks&pgtype=Article&region=Footer). Recently I read something about people who choose not to have children. These were discussions with people who were happy. It was interesting that **all the people highlighted were in the age range of 45 to 55.** I’m sure there are plenty of 70 and 80 year-olds who are happy being childless, but many who are happily childfree at 50 probably have a different perspective at 75. Anyway, life is long.

[Escape from Wuhan](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/03/09/escape-from-wuhan/#slide-1).

A [conversation on YouTube with James F. Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN1xheqTwhk&feature=youtu.be).

[They Wanted Research Funding, So They Entered the Lottery](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/science/research-funding-lotteries.html?algo=identity&fellback=false&imp_id=263035964&imp_id=645967959&action=click&module=Science%20%20Technology&pgtype=Homepage).

[Why East Asians but not South Asians are underrepresented in leadership positions in the United States](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/14/1918896117). I think this is related: [SoftBank’s Rajeev Misra Used Campaign of Sabotage to Hobble Internal Rivals](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-rajeev-misra-used-campaign-of-sabotage-to-hobble-internal-rivals-11582743294?mod=hp_lead_pos5).
