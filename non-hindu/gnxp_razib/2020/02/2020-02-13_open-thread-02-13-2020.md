The late author, Alan Cameron, is highly erudite and has strong opinions. It reads somewhat like a lawyerly argument, and I doubt many are knowledgeable enough to evaluate it in full (I’m not), but it’s a fascinating anthropology of the changing nature of what religion was in the 4th-century. Read along with [The Final Pagan Generation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00Q6B7FXW/geneexpressio-20) and [Pagans: The End of Traditional Religion and the Rise of Christianity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00L7X6ZU8/geneexpressio-20).

Many years ago when [Edward Snowden released the NSA documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Release_of_NSA_documents) I recall listening to a journalist admit on a radio show that if some of the things reported in those documents were claimed without that evidence they would have just assumed they were a crazy conspiracy theorist. To me, that was a window into the reality that the people we trust and pay to sift through reality are often just rubber-stamping the pronouncements of power.

[Liberal Faculty Endorse Testing: A California task force shows that banning tests helps the privileged](https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-faculty-endorse-testing-11581466138). Read the [whole report](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf?mod=article_inline). Nothing too surprising. The “softer” metrics are, the easier they are for the privileged to game.

I have high uncertainty about the coronavirus.

He has a really sincere defense of Robert Jordan’s [Wheel of Time](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002U3CCYM/geneexpressio-20) series…which was strange to me, since I’d dismissed Jordan’s work as something that would appeal to 12-year-old boys (about when I started reading them). Curiously, I notice that the newest covers of Jordan’s work make it look less like a fantasy.
