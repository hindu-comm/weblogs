The years of the dragon

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/71GK5BW6JXL.gif?resize=183%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/71GK5BW6JXL.gif?resize=183%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073Q4328C//geneexpressio-20)Reading Noah Smith’s [Invincible empire?](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/invincible-empire) I thought back to David Wingrove’s future history where China reigns supreme, [Chung Kuo](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073Q4328C//geneexpressio-20). In the 1990’s it felt like this was very speculative science fiction. After all, **we all knew that China would become liberal democratic in a few decades.**

I guess the joke was on us. The [Chung Kuo](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073Q4328C//geneexpressio-20) series posits a technologically advanced, if stagnant, world dominated by a social system that recapitulates Neo-Confucianism. If not exactly a dystopia, reading it as an American in the 1990’s meant suspending disbelief. After all, **we knew the future would be American.**

In the 2000’s I was quite open to Gordon Chang’s thesis about the [collapse of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Chang#Collapse_of_China). I know many people back then who were very skeptical, reasonably so, about China’s economic growth statistics and the sustainability of its model. It was all fake. Unlike the West, which is based on objectivity and truth. Those who I am still in touch with who were skeptics are skeptics no more. You can fake a lot of statistics, but finished goods exported to the world or energy consumption are harder to fake.

That was our lodestar. In the 2020’s I think it will be all about the dragon. As Smith notes, China is already 40% of Asia’s GDP. It’s already huge, important, and its “gravitational pull” is hard to escape.

In private forums, I am on I sometimes ask: the dragon or our nihilist elites? I have no illusion about what China is. But I am also fearful of what our American intelligentsia is becoming. And I am not the only one. The 2016 great “Russia flip” shows ideological valences in relation to foreign actors can change fast.

This will be an interesting decade…

**Note:** If it is not obvious, I began 2020 as a reluctant “China dove.” I am not that anymore, but I am not sure what I am.
