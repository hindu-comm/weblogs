Have I mentioned my Substack?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/substack.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/substack.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)](https://razib.substack.com/)Thank you again to everyone who has [subscribed](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?) to my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/). This is a millionth (and final!) reminder to anyone who was planning to [subscribe](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?) to Substack that my 2020 rates are the lowest allowable on the platform and **will be adjusted upward in the new year.**

For anybody who took the healthy approach of being offline for the last couple of weeks, you might like something within among all this content for I cranked out for the [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/). Here are five free blog posts (available whether your subscription is paid or unpaid):

- [The age of genetic engineering
  begins](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-age-of-genetic-engineering-begins) - [The original Chinese
  man](https://razib.substack.com/p/3000-years-of-chinese-history) - [Applying IQ to IQ](https://razib.substack.com/p/applying-iq-to-iq) - [Your roots are
  showing](https://razib.substack.com/p/your-roots-are-showing) - [In God We Trusted](https://razib.substack.com/p/in-god-we-trusted)

I chose the topics, so of course, I enjoyed writing all of these. But I think [the one on the Zhou](https://razib.substack.com/p/3000-years-of-chinese-history) was the most satisfying for me. Not a surprise that it was the [IQ piece](https://razib.substack.com/p/applying-iq-to-iq) that seemed to speak to the most readers.

I pulled 6 favorite past podcasts from my archives too:

- Day 1: [Shadi
  Hamid](https://razib.substack.com/p/podcast-countdown-to-2021-day-1-shadi) - Day 2: [Vagheesh
  Narasimhan](https://razib.substack.com/p/podcast-countdown-to-2021-day-2-vagheesh) - Day 3: [Thomas Chatterton
  Williams](https://razib.substack.com/p/podcast-countdown-to-2021-day-3-thomas) - Day 4: [Alexander
  Ioannidis](https://razib.substack.com/p/podcast-countdown-to-2021-day-4-alexander) - Day 5: [Suhag
  Sukhla](https://razib.substack.com/p/podcast-countdown-to-2021-day-5-suhag) - Day 6: [Chris
  Stringer](https://razib.substack.com/p/revisiting-chris-stringer-the-state)

I’m working through a long list of favorite thinkers I already know and have enjoyed talking with in the past, and people who are on my radar to chase down for a first podcast, but if there’s anyone you think I’d be remiss not to try and connect with this year, **please leave a comment.**

![def no dino](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201231_120709.jpg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1)

I had a great Christmas, not least because my youngest became completely obsessed with dinosaurs overnight (thanks, [Schleich](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M3P8FK5/geneexpressio-20)!). Not going to lie, I was always a little disappointed his older siblings had no love for dinosaurs (one of his siblings had such disdain for all things biology, that for probably a solid year, he would dismiss any quadruped sighting, whether cow, sheep, horse, etc. with an unimpressed “DIE-SAUR”).

But the tail is wagging the dog since Christmas and half of sibling chatter is now debates of omnivore v. carnivore v. herbivore and discussions of the Jurassic and things like what syllable of diplodocus is emphasized. The caliber of illustrated books for kids now, refinements on old hypotheses, and depth of detail known today are leaving me with a lot of updates to perform on my mid-80’s body of dinosaur knowledge. So what should I read? Who should I know? Anyone it would be a shame not to seek out for the podcast?

It drops today. We discussed both [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0006531644/geneexpressio-20) and [The Lagoon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143127985/geneexpressio-20). Each well worth a read if you missed them. [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0006531644/geneexpressio-20) is a quick read; [The Lagoon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143127985/geneexpressio-20) is a bit encyclopedic (we discuss why it’s so long). Additionally, we revisited his op-ed on [race](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/opinion/a-family-tree-in-every-gene.html) from 2005, his argument in favor of ‘[neo-eugenics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17139290/)‘, recent work on [cultural evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0802-4?proof=t), and the impact of wokeness on the academy in Britain.

Newer readers may find my [interview with Armand](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/10-questions-for-armand-m-leroi.php) from the end of 2005 interesting.
