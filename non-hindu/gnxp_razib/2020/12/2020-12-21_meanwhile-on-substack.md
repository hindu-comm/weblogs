Think of it as a little thank you to everyone who was so quick to [subscribe](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe) when I launched, and a quick sampler of some of my core themes and obsessions for those still weighing whether to sign on for the [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) paid content stream (a combination of occasional deep dives in a written format + weekly (or more frequent) podcasts, as well as the gated comment community).

Whether I remember to cross-promote here on the blog or not, you’ll get automatically alerted to these occasional free releases if you’re on the free [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) list, so whether [paid](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe) or [free](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe), I hope you’ll take a second to get on my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) list today.

Day 1, I surveyed [the evolving landscape of biotech](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-age-of-genetic-engineering-begins):

> In the late 2000s Peter Thiel and Tyler Cowen made waves arguing that > technological progress had declined since the middle of the 20th > century. Having spent my adulthood in the period between 2000 and > 2020, I was quite open to the idea. I watched the Jetsons.**We don’t > live in the world of the Jetsons.**

> It’s a meme that China has “5,000 years of history.” This is false. > The first historically attested dynasty is the Shang, which emerged > approximately 3,600 years ago. And even the Shang are semi-historical, > insofar as many of the details of the Shang society and state are > known only superficially. The Shang are shadows to us, not flesh and > blood narratives.

And then I examine what history suggests might await us as we pitch out this long-used bulwark against entrenched elite hoarding of prestige opportunities:

> Homo sapiens are very smart. They are very smart because they have > large brains. This is not controversial. In relation to our body size, > humans have bulging craniums housing large brains. About 20% of our > caloric intake feeds our brain when we’re resting even though it’s > only 2% of our body weight. It’s a calorically expensive organ.

Day 4 and Day 5 remain.

And if you’re one of those still considering whether to sign up for the [paid](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe)[Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) or whether to give it as a [gift](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?&gift=true) this holiday season, now’s a good time to lock in the forum’s lowest allowed pricing. I’ll be adjusting it up after the new year.
