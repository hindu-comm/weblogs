Open Thread – 12/27/2020 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/notbornyesterday.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/notbornyesterday.jpeg?resize=180%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691178704/geneexpressio-20)I’ve kind of fallen down on the job regarding the book club. But, I will catch up with [Not Born Yesterday](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691178704/geneexpressio-20) and [Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307472213/geneexpressio-20). My goal is to catch-up this week after a few calls tomorrow.

It’s been a busy last quarter of 2020 for various reasons. I will offer a bit of a personal note and admit that this has been a very nice Christmas with the family. The kids are not yet at the age where they hate me. yet.

A lot of my spare energy has been going into [my Substack](https://razib.substack.com/). Since you read this weblog you know all about it and are probably sick of hearing about it, but just to reiterate, I imagine it is a synthesis of a blog, a podcast, and a newsletter. Last week I recorded podcasts with Armand Leroi and [Alina Chan](https://twitter.com/Ayjchan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). I’ll be posting Armand’s this week for subscribers, and then pushing in a few weeks to the [ungated website](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/).

In setting up the short conversation with Alina I feel like I’ve gotten a better sense of her. Perhaps she’s fooling me, but my initial impression that she’s sincere and earnest has been confirmed. I wish more young academics had her fire for truth above all else. There are more important things than truth, but if you are an academic in particular, why are you in the game if the truth isn’t number one?

[Chinese Demography: China is shrinking, and is about to shrink more](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/chinese-demography). These are structural forces we all know. I think they give the rest of the world an opportunity to constrain the dragon. The problem that I see is that the West seems to be engaging in some sort of cultural suicide, in particular the United States.

[Democrats see grim prospects in final election results despite Biden’s win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-election-democrats-losses/2020/12/20/b5b2cec4-3ff5-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html). The takeaway is what [Kevin Drum](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/) observed: **Democratic elites and base are very culturally liberal, and don’t want to concede an inch on cutting edge progressive values.** Non-college educated America barely knows what they’re talking about half the time. I think this is a bit like the Republican fixation on cutting taxes to increase revenue and the cult of the “job-creator.” People on the Right are pretty bullish on 2022 and 2024.

That being said, the Left controls all the major cultural institutions. What does it matter if you win elections if in 2024 every member of Congress is mandated to state their pronoun on the directory?

Going to have to look at this closely.

Last week I posted a long conversation with [Samon Burja](https://razib.substack.com/p/samo-burja-on-social-technology-china). I’ll ungate it soon. But I think you’ll enjoy it.

[How 2 Pro-Nazi Nobelists Attacked Einstein’s “Jewish Science”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/). Science must fall?
