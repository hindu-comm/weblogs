Open Thread – 12/13/2020

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unslearning.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unslearning.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)](https://razib.substack.com/p/david-shor-the-uncancellable)Sorry about the spare “open thread”, but busy. I should mention I have a gated version of my [David Shor interview](https://razib.substack.com/p/david-shor-the-uncancellable) up. Lots of talk about Miami and being Sephardic Jewish.

Also, the ungated [Unsupervised Learning](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) podcast site is up. I’ll do a delay before releasing it. Right now we’ve got Anders Bergstrom, Charles Murray, and Eric Cline. There are lots of more I prerecorded. As I have said before the goal with the new podcast is to have more ‘evergreen’ discussions, rather than what’s just “in the news.”

Obviously, thanks to all the paying [subscribers](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Frazib.substack.com%2Fp%2Fdavid-shor-the-uncancellable), but I also suggest you subscribe free because I’m going to use it as my newsletter in general. If you subscribed via Mailchimp you are already in the system, so don’t worry.

I’m a little worried about Substack as a platform because who knows in this day and age? But as long as Andrew Sullivan is there, I assume I’ll be OK. Also, [Colin Wright](https://colinwright.substack.com/) has started a Substack, [Noah Smith](https://noahpinion.substack.com/) has been cranking stuff out.
