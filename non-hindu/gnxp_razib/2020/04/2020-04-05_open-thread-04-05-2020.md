But you need to read and watch other things too. Staying with the “plague” theme, [Plagues and People](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385121229/geneexpressio-20) is probably the most important book in terms of influence on me.

– [The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OCXFWE/geneexpressio-20). In my “to read” pile.

– [The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008O8JWZY/geneexpressio-20). Again, in my “to read” pile.

[Latest on Sintashta-Petrovka chariots](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2020/04/latest-on-sintashta-petrovka-chariots.html). David at Eurogenes is going to keep “truckin'” as they say, even through COVID-19.

[SoftBank Won’t Buy \$3 Billion in WeWork Stock](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/business/economy/wework-softbank-stock.html?action=click&module=Latest&pgtype=Homepage). Remember when WeWork was important?

[‘We Are in a Cage:’ Spanish Town Lives Under a Lockdown Within a Lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/world/europe/coronavirus-igualada-spain-lockdown.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage). I think the USA needs targeted quarantine.

[Virus Soars Among Ultra-Orthodox Jews as Many Flout Israel’s Rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/middleeast/coronavirus-israel-cases-orthodox.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/framing_early_middle_ages.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/framing_early_middle_ages.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006SF3M5G/geneexpressio-20)Talking about “quarantine reading” I think Chris Wickham’s [Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean, 400-800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006SF3M5G/geneexpressio-20) shows how a complex and monetized civilization “unwinds” and regresses toward a simpler modality. I don’t see the “fall of Rome” as a good prediction for what’s going on with us, but it’s a cautionary tale because the Romans began to view themselves as an eternal civilization.

[How Coffee Became a Modern Necessity](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-coffee-became-a-modern-necessity-11585972861?mod=hp_lista_pos1). It’s probably not optimal, but mostly I drink coffee rather than water (this is a habit I developed when I lived in Davis, CA, because the water in Davis was so bad).

[The Probability of Fusions Joining Sex Chromosomes and Autosomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.010751v1).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/powerandplenty.jpg?resize=150%2C230&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/powerandplenty.jpg?resize=150%2C230&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003SNJEPS/geneexpressio-20)[Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003SNJEPS/geneexpressio-20). Economic history is always interesting. I got into the topic in the lead-up to the 2008 recession. Now that we might be facing a depression, I guess it’s time again.

[France’s Forever War in the Sahel](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/africa/france-sahel-west-africa-.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

[Sexually Antagonistic Selection on Genetic Variation is Rare in Humans](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.009670v1).
