The role of obesity in the COVID-19 crisis

There has been a fair amount of anecdotal and a bit of statistical evidence that obesity is somehow associated with individuals who have worse progression of COVID-19. The data out of China I saw wasn’t significant statistically speaking. The problem? **There didn’t seem to be enough obese people in their samples.** Then anecdotes and some data came out of Europe implicating obesity as a risk factor. And, doctors started reporting a disproportionate number of obese patients in the ICU.

Now we have really good evidence, [Factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 disease in New York City](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794v1):

> We conducted a **cross-sectional analysis of all patients with > laboratory-confirmed Covid-19** treated at a single academic health > system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with > follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary **outcomes were > hospitalization and critical illness** (intensive care, mechanical > ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable > logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and > maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key > splitters….Strongest hospitalization risks were age ≥75 years (OR > 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), > **BMI\>40** (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% > CI, 1.9-11.2)…In the decision tree for admission, the most important > features were age \>65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most > important was SpO2\<88, followed by procalcitonin \>0.5, troponin > \<0.1 (protective), age \>64 and CRP\>200. Conclusions: Age and > comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, > admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most > strongly associated with critical illness.

I’ve reformated table 3 of the regression below. It’s important to note here that the whole population is infected. The table is assessing the risk out of the infected sample that someone is going to go critical (which means a host of things, but entails hospitalization). Remember that a lot of the comorbidities associated with obesity are in the table. That means the risk of obesity is viewed as an independent variable. One can make some mechanistic arguments about the inflammatory effects of lipids, etc. That’s neither here nor there.

When assessing the risk of various nations is that 3% of Japanese are obese, while 40% of Americans are obese.
