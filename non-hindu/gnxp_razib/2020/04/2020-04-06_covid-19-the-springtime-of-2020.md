COVID-19, the springtime of 2020

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_19.jpg?resize=600%2C347&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_19.jpg?resize=600%2C347&ssl=1)](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/)

A lot of my Covid-19 commentary is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan), but since I delete my tweets every 2 weeks it’s ephemeral. So I’ll post about once a week about a “status update” of sorts of my perceptions, predictions, and general sense.

First, **I’m more optimistic than I was a few weeks ago.** The main reason is that most of the nation is shut down, and social distancing is happening, broadly, albeit to various degrees. My mid-February back-of-the-envelope estimate of \~500,000 excess deaths is unlikely. I think the range of 100,000 to 200,000, given by the American government, is reasonable. But I’m hoping we can do a little better than that. Let’s say \~85,000.

The reason I’ll go on the low side is that **I think there is still much to learn.** And, a lot of the unknowns are “positive” for us in the medium term. If regional heterogeneity persists, that means we can learn from the successes (e.g., test-and-trace as in South Korea). Perhaps there is a “miracle drug” in the offing. We don’t know. I think the “worst-case” scenario of untrammeled infection is pretty well understood, so I don’t actually see as many downside unknowns.

A lot of people are asking me about the [IHME](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/uw-model-shows-number-us-coronavirus-deaths-will-peak-mid-april/4OKNGGW3PNBGLMGC3RF6JWZ324/) model, and the fact that hospital bed shortfalls don’t seem to be as bad as the model predicted. **I think this isn’t an issue with the model, it’s an issue with how accurate people think models are going to be.** Model-building is important for fine-grained decision making but at the high level, the metrics are going to be more coarse. Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic is highly regional in the USA. A friend whose best friend is a medical resident at a New York City hospital confirms it is as bad as the media represents.

That being said, the western United States seems to be doing OK. The catastrophe in Washington state never really materialized. People are dying and have died, but the early actions of the government and populace of Washington seem to have forestalled a major outbreak. Similarly, the early actions of the Bay area leadership seem to have made a difference.

With that optimism put out there, **we need to note the difference between mortality and morbidity.** COVID-19 patients who have to go to the hospital use many resources and even mild cases have a longer course than the flu. More importantly, **like SARS it is likely that for the severe cases, who outnumber the deaths by several folds, there will be lifetime problems.**

Some parts of the USA will come out of lockdown on May 1st. Others will not. We will have a better sense of the variables that impact R and virulence as the summer progresses.

Speaking of variables, [Obesity and COVID-19 Severity in a Designated Hospital in Shenzhen, China](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556658):

> Of them, 53·1% were normal weight, 4·2% were underweight, 32·0% were > overweight, and 10·7% were obese. Patients with obesity, versus > without, were tended to have cough (P=0·03) and fever (P=0·06). After > adjusting for potential confounders, compared to normal weight, > overweight showed 86% higher, and obesity group showed 2·42-fold > higher odds of developing severe pneumonia. Despite a non-significant > sex interaction was found (P=0·09), the association appeared to be > more pronounced in men than in women. The odds ratios (95% confidence > intervals) for severe pneumonia in overweight and obesity was 1·96 > (0·78-4·98) and 5·70 (1·83-17·76) in men, and 1·51 (0·57-4·01) and > 0·71 (0·07-7·3) in women, respectively.

The average American adult has a BMI of \~26.5. We define “obese” as BMI \> 30.
