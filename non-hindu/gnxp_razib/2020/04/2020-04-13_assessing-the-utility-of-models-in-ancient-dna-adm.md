Assessing the utility of models in ancient DNA admixture analyses

[Assessing the Performance of qpAdm: A Statistical Tool for Studying Population Admixture](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.032664v1):

> qpAdm is a statistical tool for studying the ancestry of populations > with histories that involve admixture between two or more source > populations. Using qpAdm, it is possible to identify plausible models > of admixture that fit the population history of a group of interest > and to calculate the relative proportion of ancestry that can be > ascribed to each source population in the model. Although qpAdm is > widely used in studies of population history of human (and non-human) > groups, relatively little has been done to assess its performance. We > performed a simulation study to assess the behavior of qpAdm under > various scenarios in order to identify areas of potential weakness and > establish recommended best practices for use. We find that qpAdm is a > robust tool that yields accurate results in many cases, including when > data coverage is low, there are high rates of missing data or ancient > DNA damage, or when diploid calls cannot be made. **However, we > caution against co-analyzing ancient and present-day data, the > inclusion of an extremely large number of reference populations in a single model, and analyzing population histories involving extended periods of gene flow**. We provide a user guide suggesting best practices for the use of qpAdm.

The Reich lab provides its [software](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/software) and [data](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/datasets). It’s really not ***that*** hard to replicate and tweak some of the analyses they do in their papers (check the supplements for the detailed specifications of the parameters). I’ve done many times when I got curious about a detail they hadn’t explored.

The preprint above is a valuable addition to the intuitions one can develop through using the packages.
