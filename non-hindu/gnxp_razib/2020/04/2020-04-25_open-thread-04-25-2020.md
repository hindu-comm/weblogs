I remember back in 2010 I was posting *daily* roundups of links and what not. No time for that.

Finished [The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01ILZT6UU/geneexpressio-20). Recommended. One thing that most of you likely know is that the surveys which indicate low levels of religiosity in China are partly an artifact of translation. Chinese who have no affiliation to a confessional religion may still have supernatural beliefs.

Reading [Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074YK9NHS/geneexpressio-20).

This piece in *Wired* is getting some attention, [‘Expert Twitter’ Only Goes So Far. Bring Back Blogs](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-expert-twitter-only-goes-so-far-bring-back-blogs/). I’ve been trying to nudge people back to blogging for the last 5 years or so, to no avail. The “activation energy” for Twitter is lower, and the exposure and feedback is so immediate. How can you compete with that? My argument is blogs have the “long tail”…but the “long tail” is also very 2000s!

The reason is that it outlines with ***structured* text is so important for dialogue.** This is most evident in the form of a scientific paper, which has a precise structure that others adhere to, and engage with. Here is part of the summary:

> Warriors of the Cloisters tells how key cultural innovations from > Central Asia revolutionized medieval Europe and gave rise to the > culture of science in the West. Medieval scholars rarely performed > scientific experiments, but instead contested issues in natural > science, philosophy, and theology **using the recursive argument > method.** This highly distinctive and unusual method of disputation > was a core feature of medieval science, the predecessor of modern > science…

You can imagine the recursive argument method working in structured debate podcasts and YouTube live streams, but I think the latency and time for thought allowed for text makes it superior in that form in terms of depth. It’s almost impossible to pull off on Twitter.

[Zoom’s Biggest Rivals Are Coming for It](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/technology/zoom-rivals-virus-facebook-google.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage). Zoom might be like Netscape.

[The genetic variation of lactase persistence alleles in northeast Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.057356v1?rss=1). I will probably blog this shortly.

I hope this is wrong.

While Western academics were prattling on about post-colonialism, Africa was being recolonized by China through debt.

[Powered by Fear, Indians Embrace Coronavirus Lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html). Fear. Indians have firsthand recent experience with the literal plague. The best predictor of how societies have reacted to SARS-CoV-2 is whether they’ve been hit by infectious epidemics recently.

I think for the West the question is can we do it. We can. It’s do we have the will? Not sure.

[The rates of introgression and barriers to genetic exchange between hybridizing species: sex chromosomes vs. autosomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.038042v1).

I [interviewed the author](http://insitome.libsyn.com/genetics-genealogy-and-secrets-unknown) of [The Lost Family: How DNA Testing Is Upending Who We Are](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1419743007/geneexpressio-20) for the podcast. I “blurbed” the book, so I obviously liked it. It’s not a monograph, there’s a pretty compelling throughline of a familial narrative, but buttressed by a thorough exploration of a lot of scientific details.
