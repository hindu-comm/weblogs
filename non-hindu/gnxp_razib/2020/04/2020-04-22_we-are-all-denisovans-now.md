We are all Denisovans now!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whoweare.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20)Since 2010 the combination of improvements in genomic technology and ancient DNA have totally revolutionized our understanding of the human past through genetic techniques. In the 2000s there was a “live debate” about archaic introgression into modern human genomes, in large part because the techniques were not powerful enough to answer the questions that were being asked (nevertheless, many thought they really knew the answer already!).

With the sequencing of the Neanderthal in 2010 we saw that non-Africans seemed to carry more Neanderthal alleles than Africans, which was suggestive evidence of archaic admixture. Before the end of the year, the Denisovans were discovered, and it was clear that their impact was significant in the Papuans (and to some extent Oceanians generally). These discoveries were a shock already, but over the years more and more subtle discoveries have occurred. To some:

– Researchers believe that the Neanderthals have some ancestry from a basal modern population (a group that diverged a long time ago)

– It is clear that there is some Denisovan ancestry in East and South Asians, as well as in peoples of the New World. And, it seems quite clear that these admixtures were from different branches of the Denisovan group of humans

– It seems quite likely that Papuans may have multiple admixture events from Denisovan populations or from people related to the Denisovans

– There is lots of circumstantial evidence that Neanderthals and Denivosons may harbor ancestry from earlier human lineages that were present in Eurasia when their ancestors pushed out of Africa \~750,000 years ago

– Lots of evidence for deep ancestry admixture within Africa

– Basal Eurasians. What are they? We still don’t know!

Add to that list a new paper, [The nature of Neanderthal introgression revealed by 27,566 Icelandic genomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2225-9):

> …humans outside of Africa trace about 2% of their genomes to admixture > from Neanderthals, which occurred 50–60 thousand years ago1. Here we > examine the effect of this event using 14.4 million putative archaic > chromosome fragments that were detected in fully phased whole-genome > sequences from 27,566 Icelanders, corresponding to a range of > 56,388–112,709 unique archaic fragments that cover 38.0–48.2% of the > callable genome. On the basis of the similarity with known archaic > genomes, we assign 84.5% of fragments to an Altai or Vindija > Neanderthal origin and **3.3% to Denisovan origin**; 12.2% of > fragments are of unknown origin. We find that Icelanders have more Denisovan-like fragments than expected through incomplete lineage sorting. This is best explained by Denisovan gene flow, either into ancestors of the introgressing Neanderthals or directly into humans…

But if you have enough data you can find it.

They had to do simulations and run some HHMs to get here. I’m not sure I believe it. But I also think it’s plausible. The two models they present are:

– Denisovans mix into Neanderthals who mix into humans

– A Denisovan related population mixes into early non-African humans just before they mixed with Neanderthals

As time goes by I suspect we’ll find many small details of past interaction.
