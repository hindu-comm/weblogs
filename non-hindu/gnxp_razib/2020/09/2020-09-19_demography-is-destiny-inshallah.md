Demography is destiny, Inshallah

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/islamic_exceptionalism.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/islamic_exceptionalism.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250061016/geneexpressio-20)I just finished doing a quick edit of an interview by some of my fellow Brown Punditeers with some fellows at the [Middle East Forum](https://www.meforum.org/) (I posted for [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan), should be live on the [podcast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/) in a few days). Listening **I felt like I was being thrown back to 2005.** All the talk about Islamism, and radicalism, etc.

From an intellectual perspective, I’m still interested in these issues, but they are not as live and salient as they were a decade ago. In the 2000s we spent a lot of time trying to understand violent Islamic radicalism. A lot of analysis of ideology. Reading of history. Modeling of various social factors.

But at the end of the day, I wonder if it’s a basic structural-demographic dynamic. The fuel of political and religious radicalism are young men. Is there enough fuel today to make Islamic radicalism the problem it was even a decade ago? Will we see ISIS as the last hurrah, the sendoff of a late 20th-century social movement that ran out of recruits?
