Let’s read!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/benedictoption.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/benedictoption.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KUCY7XI/geneexpressio-20)Anyone who has read this weblog over the last few years has sensed my hopelessness and despair about the fallen world and in particular the American republic and Western civilization. I have told [Rod Dreher](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/) many times privately that we irreligious also need our “Benedict option” in a “darkening world.” But while the Roman Empire fell due to the exogenous shocks of barbarian invasions, as well as internal decay, I feel the exogenous shock of coronavirus just exposed our societal ills, and we’re committing suicide all by ourselves.

My wife is reading [The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07WX1DFZW/geneexpressio-20). When I first heard the author, Nicholas Carr, talk about his book in 2010 on a podcast I was walking up Cedar street in Berkeley. I remember this moment so well because I laughed loudly. I scoffed. I almost dropped my iPod shuffle. Those were the days.

Unfortunately, though Carr’s book is dated, and some of the research seems tenuous, I am beginning to accept more and more of his conclusions. A few years ago I expressed some alarm at the rise of YouTube commentators. They are fine as far as it goes, **but they are extremely popular and often informationally vapid.**

Today, we have TikTok, where some of my younger friends admit to me that they spend hours and hours watching sequences of videos such as [this](https://twitter.com/imadprint/status/1309541352045150210).

I’m almost done with [The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B3M3UMO/geneexpressio-20). The question then is, **what do I read next?** But then I thought, why just me? I haven’t done anything like a “book club” in many years. But why not? There isn’t a reason I have to march alone through the TikTok world.

So here’s the plan: **I will pick a book, and read one chapter a week, and write a blog post about it.** And those of you who also want to read the book can comment (if you have a blog or something you can post and I will link to that post; but who has blogs now?).

Here are some options, **and I’ll let readers in the comments help choose**:

I’m open to selections outside of this list…but I would prefer something on this list unless you have an awesome idea. These are books I already own and are in my “stack” of to-reads. Also, obviously remember that books written by academics are going to be much more dense than those written by journalists and commentators, which will be “quick reads.”
