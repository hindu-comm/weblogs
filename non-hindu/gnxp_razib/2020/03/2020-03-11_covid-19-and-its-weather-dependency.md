COVID-19 and its weather dependency

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-11-15.56.46.jpg?resize=600%2C373&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-11-15.56.46.jpg?resize=600%2C373&ssl=1)](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)  
We’ve been talking about Coronavirus in our house pretty constantly since early February. I’ve come out into the open and admitted my family is doing self-quarantine to reduce spread (we don’t think we’re sick, but we don’t want to spread it by getting sick). I haven’t been very hopeful in a month due to what I see as complacency. The median/modal case scenarios in my head have been getting worse and worse over the weeks.

**Over the last hour, I’ve changed and become a bit more hopeful because I’m optimistic that COVID-19 *does have a relationship to weather*. I’m not confidently optimistic, but there’s now a glimmer of hope.** The reason is due to this preprint, [Temperature and Latitude Analysis to Predict Potential Spread and Seasonality for COVID-19](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3550308).

So several things we had talked about in our family:

- First, why no massive outbreaks in Africa and Southeast Asia? These
  are areas with lots of Chinese from China. Singapore did a good job,
  but Indonesia, Cambodia, and Laos are not societies that are nearly as
  developed. Vietnam mobilized, but to be frank, I’m skeptical the
  Phillippines could if they wanted to. Africa has massive public health
  problems, and no capacity for the sort of totalitarian mobilization of
  China, with the exception of Rwanda and Eritrea. - Why the huge outbreaks in Iran, Italy, and now the Pacific Northwest? - Why no major outbreak in Russia?

An immediate explanation is **bad reporting.** But in all these cases? Also, hospital systems get overwhelmed. This seems like it would get out.

The major result from the paper is here:

> Further analysis using 2-meter (2m) temperatures from 2020 rather than > hPa temperatures yields similar results (Figure 2). In the months of > January 2020 in Wuhan and February 2020 in the other affected, **there > is a striking similarity in the measures of average temperature (5-11 > degrees C) and relative humidity (RH, 47-79%) (Table 1)**. In addition > to having similar average temperature, humidity, and latitude > profiles, these locations also exhibit a commonality in that the > timing of the outbreak coincides with a nadir in the yearly > temperature cycle, and thus with relatively stable temperatures over a > more than a one month period of time (Supplementary Figure 1). In > addition, none of the affected cities have minimum temperatures going > below 0 degree C (Supplementary Figure 1).

Here’s the figure:
