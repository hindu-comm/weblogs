The enormous demographic impact of the Indo-Europeans

Later, I learned and understood that language families can spread by diffusion and cultural assimilation. In [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07H38F3KM/geneexpressio-20) David Anthony outlines an elite emulation model of the Indo-Europeanization, whereby groups of warriors associated with the Kurgan cultures took over and reshaped a broad range of societies.

The samples Anthony provided were instrumental in recalibrating his own model. It turns out that steppe migrants were extremely genetically impactful. Rather than a small minority, many archaeological cultures seem to have been predominantly steppe in genetic origin (total number of ancestors). The best estimates seem to be that ancestry from the steppe is somewhat more than half the total in northern and eastern Europe, and somewhat less than half in southern and western Europe (i.e., northeast to southwest cline).

More recently, it also seems that a substantial, though a smaller, proportion of the ancestry in southern Asia also derives from the steppe peoples. Within India itself, the range seems to be from 25-30% among some groups, such as North Indian Brahmins and Jatts, to a more typical range between 5 and 15% (peasant castes in South India are closer to the former, peasant castes in the Gangetic plain are closer to the latter).

More concretely, I think that the vast majority of the increase occurred between 2500 BC (when expansions into Britain and Southern Europe seem to have occurred) and 1000 BC (when the core area of the Indian subcontinent was Aryanized).

\* I did stuff like weighted caste groups in Uttar Pradesh, looked at the populations of India states, added Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as assigning estimates to European countries. I did some back-of-the-envelope for North and South America (e.g., assume that 50% of the ancestry is Iberian, and assume that 25% of that 50% is steppe).
