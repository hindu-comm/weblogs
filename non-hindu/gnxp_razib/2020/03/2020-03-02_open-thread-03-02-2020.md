It’s shocking to me how many people seem unaware of the massive variation in risk of mortality based on age. There seems to be some heterogeneity when it comes to depleted shelves in grocery stores. For example, while people freaked out about local shortages at Costco and Trader Joes, we went to our local discount market where many Latinos shop, and it was like an ordinary day.

It seems like COVID-19 is exposing some serious “state capacity” problems. Is this the first indication that the water is finally receding and our society will be exposed?

This goes a little too far in my opinion, but still useful, [COVID-19 California Information and Recommendations — A letter to my friends](https://medium.com/@tubewolf/covid-19-california-information-and-recommendations-a-letter-to-my-friends-d75eee172b6c).

In [The Great Warming](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0047DVI5M/geneexpressio-20) Brian Fagan argued that complex agricultural societies were less “anti-fragile” than the hunter-gatherer societies which preceded them. They were less able to withstand exogenous shocks, and so you periodically saw social collapse.

[The Human Web: A Bird’s-Eye View of World History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393925684/geneexpressio-20) presents a counter-narrative: **as societies have become more complex, there has been more redundancy and regional collapses are less extreme and shorter.** Ray Huang observed the same in [China: A Macrohistory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00VV3GP36/geneexpressio-20). The interregnums between dynasties kept getting shorter and milder.

Are we more robust or are we more fragile? Why not both?

[Italy, Europe’s Coronavirus Lab](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/italy-europe-coronavirus-.html). “People have stopped shaking hands, let alone greeting each other with a kiss.” I think greetings of strangers involving physical contact are kind of gross.

She’s Losing the Black Vote.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-vote.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) “…she scored highest among the 2020 candidates on the Center for Urban and Racial Equity’s “Racial Justice Scorecard,”…and announced the support of a collection of activists and organizers called Black Womxn For in November.” I have a hard time not believing that reporters who are writing these pieces aren’t subtly trolling their readers. Elizabeth Warren’s team seems to have strong ideas about what nonwhite voters should be like, but they are less familiar with what they really are like. One thing to remember is that since the overwhelming majority of black voters are Democrats, black Democrats are much more ideologically diverse and know many more people of different ideologies than white Democrats.
