Living in a time of COVID-19

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid19.jpg?resize=600%2C324&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid19.jpg?resize=600%2C324&ssl=1)](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

We’ve come really far over the past month or so in relation to coronavirus. There are lots of resources online and people should be making recourse to them. [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) and [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) are great. If I were you, I would at least read the [Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). **But, please read everything with skepticism and a grain of salt.**

I’ve been “monitoring the situation” since January…with alarm beginning in the first week of February. My own family’s actions have moved from “social distancing” to isolation. Work-from-home, cancellation of playdates, and keeping children out of the schools. All of these actions exhibit guesswork and decision-making on incomplete information. In the WHO-China report, they note that “people interviewed by the Joint Mission Team could not recall episodes in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.” And yet children do seem to shed RNA after infection, and many experts do think [they can transmit](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-kids-what-role-transmission/).

Unless you’ve been sleeping under a rock, you’ve seen this [table](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/):

But strangely many older people I know did not know about the age profiles of the fatalities. Many people are promoting the idea that this is as risky as a bad flu season. This is wrong. The case fatality rate for [flu pandemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_disease_case_fatality_rates) seems to be in the \~0.1% range. The initial case fatality rates for coronavirus seems to be closer to 1%, though I assume that we can drive that down some. But, I have a hard time imagining that it will be as low as the flu. With its spread, with R0 going above 1, one can imagine a large proportion of the population being infected in the United States, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. And yet many people [are complacent](https://twitter.com/business/status/1237263172299558914), going on vacations and not altering their behavior in any manner.

After spending a fair amount of time reading papers and data I think there will be some patterns that will play out.

- Age is a huge factor. Therefore, societies which are very
  young-skewing will probably not see the chaos and suffering that
  societies with many older people (China and Italy) will experience. - There are mixed reports from the analysis of spread in regards to
  temperature and humidity. But I suspect that on the margin there will
  be some effect of warmer temperatures, though please remember that
  many of these pandemics with seasonal patterns come back in waves in
  subsequent years. - Men seem to be more susceptible than women, and most definitely to
  dying from the disease. One of the preprints I read shows that boys
  are more likely to be infected than girls. This rules out, to me,
  smoking as driving the sex difference. Please note that the ACE2 gene
  which is responsible for the receptor in which coronavirus targets is
  on the X chromosome. - I assume there is some difference between ethnic groups, and if there
  is some difference East Asians are possibly more vulnerable since it
  was selected in that population first. We won’t know for a long time
  yet, and Whatsapp chains arguing there is an “African gene” or “Indian
  gene” which is protective are clearly misguided (the one paper I saw
  which looked at allele frequency differences showed a fair amount of
  overlap between populations).

There are lots of people with lots of information. You make your own decisions. Until the government makes it for you. But, I have to say that one thing that is really disturbing is the message out of Fox News and its penumbra of pundits that people are trying to create a panic to destroy the economy and undermine the Donald Trump. I have been having discussions with Right-leaning people since January about the virus, **and most of us have been getting progressively more alarmed by the week**. It is true that some people see a political opportunity in the crisis, but this is not a manufactured pandemic, and it will have a massive impact on life and liberty in this country. The median age of the [Fox News viewer](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-old-is-the-average-fox-news-viewer-in-america.html/) is 65. Many of the people who are being told that this is just like a bad flu season are the highest risk of dying. I am pretty sure that people in my orbit will die unexpectedly within the next 3 months of coronavirus.

Michael Brendan Dougherty writes in National Review, [I Fear the Coronavirus](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/coronavirus-reasons-to-worry/). He says that people have told him “It’s just like the flu, but not as bad.” I hope that these people are correct, but I’m 99.9% they are wrong.

Meanwhile, certain groups of liberal intellectuals seem to periodically become more focused on [anti-Asian racism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/opinion/coronavirus-panic.html), or see the virus as an opportunity to [make fun of enemies](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1234548588732088321).

**My own take is that we’ll have time for culture wars after the suffering and deaths of the next few months.** Let’s pause on that for a moment.

Anyway, I’ll let readers leave their comments here.
