Coronavirus: the revenge of the old gods!

And not just me. Every day for the last week I see headlines which shout: “India the next hotspot!” In fact, Bloomberg put up a video interview, [Is India the Next Coronavirus Hotspot?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-03-24/is-india-the-next-coronavirus-hotspot-video), predicting 300 to 500 million infections, just before I wrote this post.

**But**, it hasn’t happened yet. Yet. I’m not holding my breath. But until India explodes, we can still make jokes about caste, untouchability, and social distancing.

I just got off a podcast with [Phillip “the Frog” Lemoine](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/covid-19-bending-the-curve-with-the-second-derivative), where we discussed our [coronablogging](https://necpluribusimpar.net/are-we-headed-toward-an-unprecedented-public-health-disaster/), and one thing we’re both struck by is the **heterogeneity** of the pandemic. The death rate is very high in Italy, rather low in Germany. And this difference persists. Spain is on an Italian trajectory, France is somewhat different. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore have contained the pandemic, all in somewhat different ways.

Coronavirus has been tardy to come to the tropics, and we’ve discussed why. Or possibilities for why.

But Phillip, and others, have marveled at the success of the Asian societies. Some peculiar internet Hindus claim that it illustrates the genius of the Sanatana Dharma. More generally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, and India, **are all are kingdoms of unreprentent heathenry**. They do not bow before the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. In contrast, Shia Iran was struck early, and the pandemic burns quite close to the seat of the Roman Catholic Church. **The kami take their revenge against those who have given themselves to the new gods.**

I jest. But I think differences will persist, and in a year we’ll know why. It looks now that New York City will be the “American Wuhan.” This is appropriate in light of the fact that New York City and Wuhan have the same population, and only New York City of the great American metropolises resembles those of the Old World in its density.

In two weeks China will [lift its lockdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/china-to-lift-lockdown-over-virus-epicenter-wuhan-on-april-8?sref=yK6wcRAT) on Wuhan. Today we are arguing about nationwide lockdown in the United States. But it seems eminently plausible that conditions for the coronavirus pandemic will be attenuated in some regions in comparison to New York City. Our problems could be more regional than we’d expect, and our solutions might have to be too.

Anyway, listen to my conversation with Phillip.
