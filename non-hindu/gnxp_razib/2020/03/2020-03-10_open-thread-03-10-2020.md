Lucius Cornelius Sulla was one of those dictators. If you haven’t, I recommend [Sulla: The Last Republican](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415336619/geneexpressio-20).

[Being Called a Cult Is One Thing, Being Blamed for an Epidemic Is Quite Another](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/coronavirus-south-korea-church.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage). 50% of people in South Korea are not religious (no religious affiliation).

[Top Saudi Royal Family Members Detained](https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-saudi-royal-family-members-detained-11583531033?mod=hp_lead_pos5). MBS is a high-roller, risking the wrath of his extended family.

[I Helped Fact-Check the 1619 Project. The Times Ignored Me.](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/06/1619-project-new-york-times-mistake-122248) If you read some American history this is patently obvious through any casual reading of the 1619 Project. It’s a piece of propaganda with factual themes.

[Neglected Quaternary legacy of biodiversity for the Mountains of Southwest China](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.969089v1). Important for paleoanthropology.

I blurbed Libby Copeland’s [The Lost Family: How DNA Testing Is Upending Who We Are](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07WVDFVJS/geneexpressio-20). It’s a good read, and I do recommend it sincerely if you are interested in this topic.

If You Value Academic Freedom, That Should Worry You](https://quillette.com/2020/03/06/ive-been-fired-if-you-value-academic-freedom-that-should-worry-you/). The headline reminds me of a Neoplatonic philosopher in 500 A.D. writing “I’ve been persecuted. If you value the old gods that should worry you.” “Academic freedom” is a 20th-century concept that persists as a shadow. It is basically a dead-letter. The intellectual project exists to serve power, so power one must become for it to serve you. You will never out-argue your jailer, they are always correct. Make them your prisoner, that is the only way to freedom and liberty.

I listen to Chapo. They’re funny, if a bit repetitive and unfair. The author of the piece, Nellie Bowles, is a scion of California’s landed aristocracy. **There is a class war going on.** Just know which side everyone is on…
