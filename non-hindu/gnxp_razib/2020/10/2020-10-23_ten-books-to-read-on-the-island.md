Ten books to read on the island

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/historyofchinesecivilization.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/historyofchinesecivilization.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521497817/geneexpressio-20)I mentioned offhand earlier today that Jacques Gernet’s [A History of Chinese Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521497817/geneexpressio-20) is one of the top ten books I’d read. I’ve read this book three or four times that I recall. It’s incredible, and I obviously I’ve only read it in translation.

But this prompted a question: **what are the other nine books?**

OK, so I’ve given it some thought. I’ll try and balance it out in a disciplinary sense, but I’ll list them now.

But second? Most of you will not be surprised that I would put [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) on the list. I still remember reading the third edition front to back the first time in 2004. Yes, I had some knowledge of population genetics before then, but only in fragments. This is the text that opened up a whole new world. Genomics has changed things since the last edition, but the basic principles are the same.

At around the same time that I was diving deeply into the Hartl & Clark book, I read Scott Atran’s [In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195178033/geneexpressio-20). The first time I tried to read this book, in 2003, I felt it was incredibly pretentious and dense. The second time, in 2004, I made my way through it, albeit slowly. It’s not an easy book to read because there are a lot of concepts the author throws at you.

On the whole, I think [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195178033/geneexpressio-20) is essential reading to understanding religion, but I’ve also moved a bit further than this, in large part because of the field of cultural evolution. But you need to get the cognitive foundations first, and this book does that.

He hadn’t gotten quite so famous, and this book is also close to his core area of research. But his fluid style clarity of exposition shines through. Though [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCTNIM/geneexpressio-20) is the Pinker book I’ve enjoyed the most, I believe it is more dated than [The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0049B1VOU/geneexpressio-20).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the_fall_of_rome.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the_fall_of_rome.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006OYD2K6/geneexpressio-20)Again, most readers will not be surprised that I’ll put Bryan Ward-Perkins’ [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006OYD2K6/geneexpressio-20) on this list. Ward-Perkins changed my view of Late Antiquity with his powerful materialist treatment. I’ve read this book three or four times. It’s a fast read.

What next? I want to say [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20), but I have to admit that I read that later than [The Blind Watchmaker](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B014LJE1HI/geneexpressio-20). Dawkins is criticized as derivative, but he is also an excellent expositor. His books are works of art in relation to scientific communication. They’re worth the time.

Though I was already an atheist when I read [The Blind Watchmaker](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B014LJE1HI/geneexpressio-20) in the early 1990s, I found the parts relating to religion far less interesting and persuasive than when he focused on science.

There’s a reason for that: **I almost never reread fiction.** Unlike many people, I didn’t have much interest in fiction as a child. I read prose translations of the Iliad and the Oddessy, as well as [Clan of the Cave Bear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001AWVRX6/geneexpressio-20). That’s about it before puberty. When I was 13 I noticed Isaac Asimov had some science fiction books. I picked up [Prelude to the Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003EY7JH6/geneexpressio-20), and the rest is history.

Of the various works of science fiction and fantasy I’ve read, if there is one I would select out of this ten, I would choose George R. R. Martin’s [A Storm of Swords](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FBFN1U/geneexpressio-20). This is book three, but it’s the best of the bunch. Marginally better than book two, [A Clash of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FC1HBY/geneexpressio-20), and definitely better than book one, [A Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QCS8TW/geneexpressio-20). Unfortunately, Martin’s books declined with book four and book five. I don’t have high hopes for the sixth book, assuming it ever comes out.

Is there anything I need to say here?

Well, what I will say is that this work was Barzun’s last great distillation of a lifetime of observation and scholarship. It’s an enjoyable “core dump,” and allows one to look into the workings of a brilliant mind. Despite its length, I felt it was a quick read. There isn’t great conceptual depth here, it’s the narrative density of information that drags you along.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/history_of_byzantine.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/history_of_byzantine.jpeg?resize=125%2C188&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M7SP1L7/geneexpressio-20)Coming down the wire, I’m going to have to put down [A History of Byzantine State and Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M7SP1L7/geneexpressio-20).

This is a massive book, and it is true to its title, interleaving military and diplomatic history with intellectual and social currents. Because Byzantium was placed between the West and the world of Islam, a book like this necessarily touches upon developments further west and east. It’s not simply singularly focused on Byzantium. Additionally, it’s time horizon is not narrow, but sweeps across various epochs, from the end of the Classical period, all the way to the conquest by the Turks.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/empiresofsilkroad.jpeg?resize=125%2C194&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/empiresofsilkroad.jpeg?resize=125%2C194&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20)The final entry is hard, but I’ll give it to [Empires of the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20). This is a strange book, but important one. The author shines a light on a different perspective, and ends the work with a peculiar rant against modernism. But imagine a world where the view of the nomad was privileged. That is what [Empires of the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20) does, giving you a “steppe-eye-view.”

I could list more. And probably five out of these ten would switch if I made a new list six months from now. But, I am pretty convinced [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) and [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006OYD2K6/geneexpressio-20) would be on any list. All are equal, but some are more equal…
