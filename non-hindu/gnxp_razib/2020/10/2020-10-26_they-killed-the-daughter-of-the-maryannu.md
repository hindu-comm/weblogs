[Human mobility at Tell Atchana (Alalakh) during the 2nd millennium BC: integration of isotopic and genomic evidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.351882v1):

> The Middle and Late Bronze Age Near East, a period roughly spanning > the second millennium BC (ca. 2000-1200 BC), is frequently referred to > as the first ‘international age’, characterized by intense and > far-reaching contacts between different entities from the eastern > Mediterranean to the Near East and beyond. In a large-scale tandem > study of stable isotopes and ancient DNA of individuals excavated at > Tell Atchana (Alalakh), situated in the northern Levant, we explore > the role of mobility at the capital of a regional kingdom. We > generated strontium isotope data for 53 individuals, oxygen isotope > data for 77 individuals, and added ancient DNA data from 9 new > individuals to a recently published dataset of 28 individuals. A > dataset like this, from a single site in the Near East, is thus far > unparalleled in terms of both its breadth and depth, providing the > opportunity to simultaneously obtain an in-depth view of individual > mobility and also broader demographic insights into the resident > population. The DNA data reveals a very homogeneous gene pool, with > only one outlier. This picture of an overwhelmingly local ancestry is > consistent with the evidence of local upbringing in most of the > individuals indicated by the isotopic data, where only five were found > to be ‘non-local’. High levels of contact, trade, and exchange of > ideas and goods in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, therefore, seem > not to have translated into high levels of individual mobility > detectable at Tell Atchana.

First, it confirms that **there was a massive pulse of Iranian/Caucasus ancestry into the western Fertile Crescent between 5000 and 2000 BC.** We don’t have any idea what was going on here, but my own suspicion is that the [Uruk period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk_period), 4000 to 3100 BC, has something to do with this genetic turnover and assimilation. We don’t know what happened during the Uruk period because there’s no real writing of narrative history (there is proto-cuneiform), but this is when city life really expanded in Mesopotamia. Additionally, there were replica copies of Mesopotamian style towns to the west, and even into Anatolia. The Uruk period was arguably the peak of Mesopotamian political power and influence before the rise of Assyria thousands of years later.

The end of the Uruk period was characterized by a massive collapse. Some archaeologists hypothesize that the catastrophe literature of the Sumerians may reflect memories of the end of the Uruk civilization. In some ways, the Akkadians and Sumerians may have lived in the shadows of their forebears.

The second issue is [“the lady in the well”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-ladyinthewell/lady-in-the-well-sheds-light-on-ancient-human-population-movements-idUSKBN2382R1). This is a woman who seems to have been pushed into a well and fallen to her death. She is the major genetic outlier from this site: “Individual ALA019 – the Well Lady – takes up an extreme outlier position in the PCA closest to sampled individuals from Bronze Age Iran/Turkmenistan/Uzbekistan/Afghanistan.”

Her positioning is unambiguous. Unless we’re missing something this woman is of “steppe” heritage. Probably Indo-Iranian. But, the best guess from the isotope work is that she was raised in the region. The data they have indicate she lived between 1550-1600 BC. She was almost certainly from an Indo-Iranian group that had settled in the region. In fact, she was almost certainly associated with the Indo-European element in Mitanni. But in this region of the world the Dasa in their walled cities overcame the free people and swallowed them up culturally and demographically.

The major lacunae in this paper, and all such papers, is Iraq. There is ancient DNA from Turkey, the Levant, but what about Iraq? I’m sure people are working on it, but this is a region that would give us a better sense of “donor” populations.
