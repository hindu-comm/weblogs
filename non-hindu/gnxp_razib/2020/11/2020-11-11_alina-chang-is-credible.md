Alina Chan is credible

> You’ve been tracking the pandemic deeply for quite some time. How plausible do you regard the theory from Alina Chan that COVID19 originated as a accidental/criminally incompetent lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

“Tracking the pandemic” is a big job, and really you can only focus on a small subset of what’s going on. In mid-November 2020 we know a lot, but there’s a lot we don’t know. **In fact, to be frank, we know a lot less than I would have thought in the spring of 2020**. I haven’t been focusing much personally on the various ideas related to the origin of the current coronavirus that’s responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. So I will pass on a few things:

– As early as late February a friend who has done work in evolutionary genetics and pathogens mentioned that both they and their mentor suspected the Chinese were covering something up, perhaps lab escape, on a Zoom call with a few others and myself. This person was told to not even bring up such views by others at the time.

– Another friend, whose own area of expertise is molecular genetics, arrived at the same conclusion independently (lab escape) and devoted some time in the late spring to the topic and queried me about my own opinions (unfortunately I had far less clear or informed views than they did, though I did tell them that others had come to the same conclusion).

– A contact of mine who is well-connected in D.C. political circles told me at about the same time that there was worry that the Chinese were covering things up, but that the PRC has a track record of “going after” people with credibility that came after them, so many people were wary of sticking their necks out (obviously no one cares about Alex Jones’ opinion, so he can say whatever he wants).

– Finally, I think I can say that there are many people who find Alina Chan’s critiques and concerns quite credible within science (e.g., people who have spoken positively about her courage and views privately to me who work in academia or industry). I am included in that number. This does not mean she is correct. But, **it does mean that the time has come to evaluate various possibilities in a calm and objective manner.** It looks plausible that we will have a vaccine in 2021, and COVID-19 will be in the rear-view mirror. We need to take stock and examine what happened in January once we have the spare bandwidth.

I am by no means a Sinophobe. On the contrary. But the behavior of the PRC as a whole needs to be examined with clarity, rather than hopefulness. China deserves accolades for its ability to contain and crush COVID-19, but that doesn’t mean that their record is unblemished. At a minimum, the PRC was using WHO as its mouthpiece in January. But, it is not out of the realm of possibility that elements within the PRC are engaging in disinformation to cover-up their own culpability.

**Note:** Here’s a Boston Magazine [profile](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2020/09/09/alina-chan-broad-institute-coronavirus/) of Chan and her ideas. If you don’t follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1326292153216229376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), I would suggest you do so.
