Up with Substack! Down with Substack!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/finalBlackWhite.jpg?resize=300%2C379&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/finalBlackWhite.jpg?resize=300%2C379&ssl=1)](https://razib.substack.com/)The [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) has been up for a week, and it’s been fun so far. Lots of people have ideas about what to do, and how to do, “paid newsletters.” I’ve gotten some feedback on Twitter and elsewhere. I may change it up, or not.

[Tanner Greer](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/11/why-i-am-bearish-on-substack.html) has a post up on his weblog, [Why I am Bearish on Substack](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/11/why-i-am-bearish-on-substack.html). He makes some good points. But to be frank, his weblog and [Kevin Drum](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/) are almost the only “bloggers” I read who aren’t on Substack. The old ecosystem is dead. But clearly, this can’t scale…I’m not going to pay \$200 a month for Substacks (well, perhaps…).

Suggestions and comments are welcome. Right now it’s a mix of free and paid stuff, and that’s my current plan.
