All narratives are wrong, some are just less wrong

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/insight.png?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/insight.png?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)](https://insitome.libsyn.com/)A few days ago Spencer and I recorded a “predictions for 2020s” episode for [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/), before we go back to “regularly scheduled programs.” One of the topics (of ten) we discussed is that the old “Out of Africa” model is going to be marginalized/complicated.

What did we mean by this? Some of the hints are already present in David Reich’s [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20). If you look at and analyze genome-wide data, especially ancient data, **there are just too many strange results to be accounted for by our current consensus understandings.** There are new things we’ll learn. And some of the old things will be wrong. We just don’t know what.

Perhaps ***too*** hard. Not only is there “archaic” admixture outside of Africa, but there is “deep structure” within Africa. At some point, there are too many epicycles, and there needs to be a major model revision.

Over ten years ago [Dienekes Pontikos](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2018/12/more-statistical-palaeoafricans.html) presented what I thought at the time was a “crazy” paradigm of back-to-Africa migration. Though I’m still not sure of that particular model, **I think there is a high likelihood of reciprocal gene-flow between Africa, and Eurasia, especially Western Eurasia, within the last few hundred thousand years.** The debates around Y haplogroup E, which is modal within Africa, but also present with deep lineages in Eurasia, shed light I think on some of the complexity.

Instead of a single “Out of Africa” movement 50-60,000 years ago, there seems to have been a sequence of events 50-100,000 years ago which resulted in the population genetic patterning that we see around us. Some of it is the classic wave expansion from a small founder group for non-Africans, but within Africa it seems there were also expansions and admixtures, albeit more complicated, continuous, and long-standing. Some of the deepest branches within African population history go back hundreds of thousands of years, but much of it dates to expansions with closer affinities to non-Africans 50-100,000 years ago.

Sometimes it can be exciting to say that the question is the answer….
