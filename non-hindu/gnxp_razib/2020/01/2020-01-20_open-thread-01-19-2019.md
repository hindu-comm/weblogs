One thing that I think seems obvious is that **all communities degrade and degenerate until only the assholes remain.** I saw this pattern in the early teens in “science writer” Twitter. I unfollowed a lot of those people in 2013-2014 because the constant drama was tiresome.

I was smug that “academic science” Twitter wasn’t like that. People were having discussions in good-faith.

It turns out that academics were no better, it’s just that writers had gotten on Twitter in full-force earlier. Just like ecosystem succession, the “climax” ecosystem is dominated by posturing smug assholes.

The problem for Twitter is that it’s democratic, open, and imposes a cap on complexity and nuance. At least with blogging, there was a niche for people who were earnest and wrote 1,000-word entries. Because of the format of Twitter, you couldn’t express a lot of complexity. You had to rely on good-faith engagement. If your interlocutor wanted to be an asshole, the medium really facilitates their behavior.

I think it’s turning them all into smug assholes. Recently I’ve started seeing pieces in some web publications which are prose forms of what I see on Twitter.

[Mohammed bin Zayed’s Dark Vision of the Middle East’s Future](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/magazine/united-arab-emirates-mohammed-bin-zayed.html). When Western journalists profile M.B.Z. they want to paint a dark picture. But does it come across that way to the fair-minded reader?

The ruling clique in Angola had a period where they were “Leftists,” or were aligned with the Soviet bloc. But if you read about the history of this faction, that was fake.

Lind is an unabashed Hamiltonian, and an admirer of Henry Clay’s “American system.” He is in some ways the inverse of Matt Stoller, though arguably both are to the Left of the Center (Stoller far more Left). Anand Giridharadas, in the review linked, is not a fan. Unlike both Stoller and Lind, Giridharadas says uninteresting and fashionable things. You will never see Giridharadas go off the script in a novel or unsurprising way. This is in contrast to both Stoller and Lind.

I bought the Lind book just now. Like I bought Stoller’s book. Mostly because these two individuals are at least sincere, as opposed to mouth-pieces for factions.

The one-child-policy was not good. On the other hand, look at the trajectory in other East Asian nations, and it’s pretty clear its impact was on the margin. China was *always* going to have this problem.

[Capitalism Draws Fire, Despite Strong Global Economy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/capitalism-draws-fire-despite-strong-global-economy-11579471201?mod=hp_lead_pos5). This piece in *WSJ* has an infographic: “Percentage of people surveyed who believe they and their families will be better off in 5 years – Global average in 2019: 47%.” This looks to be the average of nations, not weighted by population. India, China, Indonesia, and Brazil, are all optimistic nations, 70-80%. These four are over 40% of the world’s population!

But I never got into the whole series, so I kind of get why the Chinese are shrugging.

Some people are mad about my [posts on Tutsi genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/01/18/the-belgians-did-not-invent-the-hutu-and-tutsi-ethnic-groups-who-have-different-origins/). Do you know who is not mad? Tutsis reaching out to me, angry that the autocratic government of Rwanda is promoting lies. In any case, there are some academics who are uncomfortable about what I did. This reminds me of the fact that a friend who works in human rights in D.C. for a minority group told me of the various groups she engages with, academics are the most cautious and cowardly (she talks to journalists, think-tankers, lobbyists, etc.).

[What Americans Don’t Understand About China’s Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/opinion/sunday/china-economy-trade.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage). It’s not China’s rise, but our quiescence.
