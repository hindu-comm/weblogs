Ideas may matter in the aggregate, but not on the individual scale

One of the things it convinced me is that **aggregate espoused beliefs had a marginal consequence on the individual level.** There were several reasons for this. Some of the elements of “higher religion” which were asserted by some beliefs, e.g., the rejection of free will in Calvinism and Sunni Islam, seem to have not been internalized in their actions by believers themselves (even if espousing those beliefs). In other cases, such as the Trinity, most believers had a very tenuous grasp on the details of what that belief entailed (e.g., the term “essence” is no longer as resonant in the modern age, even among intellectuals).

I’m not entirely convinced by Rubin’s argument, but it’s a legitimate one.

More broadly, the field of “cultural evolution” has convinced me that norms, values, and practices, can bind groups together to produce cohesion, and result in inter-group differences in characteristics which redound to their success in competition.

Where does this leave me? In David Abulafia’s [The Great Sea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00551S1HI/geneexpressio-20) the author mentions Amalfi’s repeated alliances with Muslim polities and corsairs. Similarly, Hungarian Protestants marched with Turks, Lithuanian Tatars with Catholics, and the Hindu generals of Muslim Mughals ruled the subcontinent for their potentate. Practicality and reality make strange bedfellows. **But, on the whole, there are systematic trends and biases.** It seems possible that though ideology has a weak to nearly zero individual impact, there are subtle differences on the margins in the aggregate which compound to produce large differences on the macro scale.
