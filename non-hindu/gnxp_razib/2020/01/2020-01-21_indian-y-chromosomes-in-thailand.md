Indian Y chromosomes in Thailand

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DvaravatiMapThailand.jpg?resize=231%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DvaravatiMapThailand.jpg?resize=231%2C300&ssl=1)The region of modern Thailand has gone through a major cultural shift over the last 1,000 years. Today the zone of Austro-Asiatic speech in mainland Southeast Asia is fragmented. To the east, there are the Khmer people of Cambodia, as well as various “hill-tribes” in Thailand and Laos who also speak Austro-Asiatic dialects. To the west, there are the Mon people of Burma.

But around 1000 A.D. the whole zone from the India ocean out toward the Mekong was dominated by Austro-Asiatic peoples. Modern-day Thailand was dominated by the Dvaravati polity, of which little is known, but possible Mon associations are assumed.

I have posted several times about the reality that it seems the whole zone between Burma and Cambodia seems to be impacted by a non-trivial proportion of South Asian (Indian) ancestry. A new [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.21.913582v1) has a lot of Y chromosomes from various groups in Thailand. Below are frequencies I pulled out of two ethnic groups with large sample sizes (from table 3 in the supplements):

|                  |           |       |        |       |                 |
|------------------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|-----------------|
|                  | **R1a+R** | **L** | **J2** | **H** | **Sample Size** |
| **Mon**          | 15%       | 2%    | 5%     | 2%    | 105             |
| **Central Thai** | 13%       | 0%    | 3%     | 5%    | 129             |

These lineages are clearly more evidence of Indian males settling in this region.
