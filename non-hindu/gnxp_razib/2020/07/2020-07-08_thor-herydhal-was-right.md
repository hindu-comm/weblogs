Thor Herydhal was right!

So I’m not going to put a long post, just subscribe to [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) and listen to what the first author has to say.

The major finding using high density SNP chips and local ancestry deconvolution seems to be that a group of people from mainland South America, probably coastal Columbia, was admixed into the population of the Marquesas. It is from the Marquesas that this genetic ancestry propagated across the eastern fringe of Oceania, including Easter Island.

**Update:** The podcast has been pushed live. It should propagate in the next hour or so.
