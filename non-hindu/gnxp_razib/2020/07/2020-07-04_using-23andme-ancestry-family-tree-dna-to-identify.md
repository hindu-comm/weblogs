Using 23andMe/Ancestry/Family Tree DNA to identify risk allele for respiratory failure with COVID-19

Several people have asked about the risk haplotype in the post below. **If you have been genotyped on Ancestry, 23andMe, and Family Tree DNA** (unless you are on 23andMe after summer of 2017) there is one SNP in high LD with the causal variant you can look up. It’s rs10490770. The risk allele is C and non-risk allele T. **If you download the raw data from any of these services you can find rs10490770 with a search, and look for your genotype** (if by some chance it is a reverse strand, the risk allele may actually be G and the non-risk allele A).

What does risk vs. non-risk mean? You can read the original paper, [Genomewide Association Study of Severe Covid-19 with Respiratory Failure](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2020283). They say: “We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system…”

It looks like in their sample CT = 1.75 times greater chance of severe respiratory problems, and CC = 3 times greater chance. The frequency is \~10% or less in Western Europeans, so very few people are CC (\~1%). But in South Asians the risk allele is 30-40%, which means that 10-15% of people have the CC genotype!

Here are the results. Focus on rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 (the top one):
