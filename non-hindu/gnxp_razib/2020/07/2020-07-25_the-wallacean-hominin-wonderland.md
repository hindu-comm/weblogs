The Wallacean Hominin Wonderland

A new preprint, [Introgression, hominin dispersal and megafaunal survival in Late Pleistocene Island Southeast Asia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219048v1), attempts to synthesize paleontology, biogeography, and human evolutionary genomics. It’s a pretty impressive effort, and short and compact:

> The hominin fossil record of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) indicates > that at least two endemic super-archaic species, **Homo luzonensis and > H. floresiensis**, were present around the time anatomically modern > humans (AMH) arrived in the region \>50,000 years ago. Contemporary > human populations carry signals consistent with interbreeding events > with Denisovans in ISEA, a species that is thought to be more closely > related to AMH than the super-archaic endemic ISEA hominins. To query > this disparity between fossil and genetic evidence, we performed a > comprehensive search for super-archaic introgression in \>400 modern > human genomes. Our results corroborate widespread Denisovan ancestry > in ISEA populations but fail to detect any super-archaic admixture > signals. **By highlighting local megafaunal survival east of the > Wallace Line as a potential signature of deep, pre-H. sapiens hominin-faunal interaction**, we propose that this understudied region may hold the key to unlocking significant chapters in Denisovan prehistory.

By “deeply diverged” we’re talking well over one million years.*Homo*itself is only two million years ago. If they are deeply diverged there are ways to probe the genome for outlier segments of DNA which seem to have “come in” from outside lineages in relation to the main branch of ancestry. The more deeply diverged the ancestry, the easier it is to pick up the signal with even small amounts of admixture.

The authors could not find such ancestry in the various population across Southeast Asia and Australia, at least not to a greater extent than elsewhere. This implies that if *luzonensis* and *floresiensis* are deeply diverged they did not mix with anatomically modern humans. Or, the **other option is that *luzonensis* and *floresiensis* are themselves Denisovans**! In other words, *luzonensis* and *floresiensis* underwent strong adaptation to local conditions and changed so much that a standard morphological comparison will yield greater phylogenetic distance than what the whole genome might indicate. As we do not have ancient DNA from *luzonensis* and *floresiensis* this hypothesis cannot be tested.

I would like the biogeographic element of the preprint fleshed out more before publication, though perhaps my relative confusion here is due to the fact that the evolutionary genomics is quite familiar to me.

I will note that the authors cite super-archaic admixture into the Andamanese, but from what I can tell most researchers in the area are [skeptical](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929719304264) of that particular [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3621). Basically, **it looks like *direct* super-archaic admixture is unlikely**. That being said, there are more complex models of indirect admixture through Neanderthals and Denisovans, and “first wave” modern humans, which I find possible.
