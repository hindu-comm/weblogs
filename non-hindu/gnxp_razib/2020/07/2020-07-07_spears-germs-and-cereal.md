Spears, Germs, and Cereal

Interesting paper, [Climate shaped how Neolithic farmers and European hunter-gatherers interacted after a major slowdown from 6,100 BCE to 4,500 BCE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0897-7):

> The Neolithic transition in Europe was driven by the rapid dispersal > of Near Eastern farmers who, over a period of 3,500 years, brought > food production to the furthest corners of the continent. However, > this wave of expansion was far from homogeneous, and climatic factors > may have driven a marked slowdown observed at higher latitudes. Here, > we test this hypothesis by assembling a large database of > archaeological dates of first arrival of farming to quantify the > expansion dynamics. We identify four axes of expansion and observe a > slowdown along three axes when crossing the same climatic threshold. > This threshold reflects the quality of the growing season, suggesting > that Near Eastern crops might have struggled under more challenging > climatic conditions. This same threshold also predicts the mixing of > farmers and hunter-gatherers as estimated from ancient DNA, suggesting > that unreliable yields in these regions might have favoured the > contact between the two groups.

I predicted this (along with many others) pattern in the late 2000s. It was just not plausible that a ‘spherical cow’ diffusion process characterized the expansion of farming. There is real topography and climate to deal with.

Jared Diamond’s [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393317552/geneexpressio-20) comes in for a lot of criticism, but the insight of latitudinal migration being easier than longitudinal has been pretty spot-on. These authors find Neolithic expansion across the Mediterranean much faster and easier to model than that going north. Pretty clearly the Near Eastern farming cultural package was a poor fit to Northern Europe, and it took some adaptation for it to get good.

That being said, I think another aspect which is going to be impossible to model in a specific sense, is that there were political and social reasons for how and when these Neolithic lifestyles spread. To give a strange analogy, the massive internal war in the Arab Empire in the late 7th century gave Byzantium a major respite from external pressure and allowed it to recover. It’s totally plausible that chaos in a Neolithic tribal confederacy might give hunter-gatherer clans time to recover and retaliate.
