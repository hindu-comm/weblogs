Twitter and the rise and fall of information republics

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theshallows.png?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theshallows.png?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07WX1DFZW/geneexpressio-20)In the spring of 1995 I was logging into [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)), reading the CIA Area Handbook series archives, and using Usenet and Talk to communicate with people on the other side of the world. The period between 1995 and 2000 was a wide-open era when phrases like “information wants to be free” were asserted as mantras. Many of us believed on some level we were going to witness a flowering of a new “republic of letters” as the global mind emerged.

As someone involved in the blog-era of the 2000s, in particular the golden age between 2002 and 2006, some of that optimism persisted despite the .com crash. We are going to “fact-check” the press. The [“Army of Davids”](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003R4Z2KO/geneexpressio-20). It was a time and place when heterodoxy was tolerated, and “thinking out loud” was expected.

Sitting here in 2020 the vision was naive, wildly optimistic, and wrong-headed. In 2020 the massive information flows on the internet consist of:

– [porn](https://amgreatness.com/2019/12/15/a-science-based-case-for-ending-the-porn-epidemic/), to which people masturbate  
– social media, which facilitates gossip  
– streaming video, which replaces television  
– and e-commerce, which sends us packages of consumer goods

In the series which began with [Ender’s Game](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003G4W49C/geneexpressio-20) the child geniuses manipulate the world through their eloquence on Usenet. This was plausible in the 1990s, and even somewhat anachronistically in the world of blogs. Today Peter Wiggin would be a teenage porn addict with dark obsessions, and Valentine Wiggin would have an OnlyFans with a low price point (because she’s compassionate).

To use an ancient framing the internet is not an extension of our noblest intentions, but our basest urges. There is far too much Rousseau. Just do what comes naturally.

The intellectual efflorescences of the past, the Golden Age of Athens, the House of Wisdom, and the Aristotelian Renaissance, to name a few, were I believe matters of contingency and fashion. That is, particular social and cultural forces come together to generate surplus amenable to intellectual leisure, and society or the rulers provide intellectuals patronage. These older intellectual subcultures were frail, a thin skein atop the real work of these societies as one of primary production, their “protection” (the men with swords), as well as the priestly classes which regulated social affairs.

Europe’s economic explosion and technology such as the printing press allowed for the emergence of an intellectual culture without a premodern parallel after 1600. But I do not believe that this is just a matter of economics. Elite European society valued science as an avocation. The fusion of science and engineering eventually made it indispensable.

Supercharged it. But I do not believe that is the case. Christopher Beckwith’s [Warriors of the Cloisters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0091XC09G/geneexpressio-20) has convinced me that the particular structure of the written text can matter a great deal in forwarding arguments and understanding. Though YouTube videos can be informative and engaging, they are often unstructured and their information density is low. The same with podcasts.

Twitter is text. But it too lacks structure. Tweet-storms/threads are always inferior to writing in paragraphs.

The platform is invaluable as a means to obtain information. And I have had many interesting conversations on Twitter. But as someone with many followers, the replies can be overwhelming. Many are not smart, because most people are not smart. Additionally, over the last few years, it has become obvious that the low barrier to entry means that those who will have little to add nevertheless will add, and, massive positive feedback loops can be generated as information bubbles emerge. Over time Twitter has begun to feel much like social life in one’s early teens. Too early to imagine one’s career or be involved in a serious relationship, but a time when hormones are flowing and new enthusiasms are taking hold. The reign of the Mean Girls.

Where do we go from here? Though Twitter will persist in its niches (e.g., it’s great for delivering “breaking news”), many will slowly become passive consumers due to the toxicity of the typical conversationalist (additionally, there are pretty clearly governments who are purchasing troll armies in bulk to try and shape conversations).

Many of us are moving to private channels of various sorts. But this is not a full replacement for Twitter. The blog is fine, as far as it goes, but several years ago friends of mine convinced me to start a [newsletter](https://razib.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=68e76131336a8f29b88c5e5c9&id=4be5c128df). I have only used it for very rare announcements. In the next few weeks, **I will debut a paid newsletter service**. These are all the rage now, and I will try and combine more polished essays along with bloggy observations. My blogs will not go away, and I will continue to blog. This will be the place where my reviews of papers and such things will continue. But I am curious about the less cacophonous “captive audience” of a newsletter.

The ultimate goal is slowly pull myself out of the vast, thin, and toxic, soup of Twitter.
