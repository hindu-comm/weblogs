What gives? Something about community. That’s what the blogosphere as a whole has lost. When was the last post that I wrote in response to another blog? It’s been so long.

[One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593190211/geneexpressio-20) is not the normal type of book I read. Since the author is a journalist, not an academic, it’s punchy, to the point, and aggressive, in a way that a lot of the passive voice monographs I read are not. [One Billion Americans](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0593190211/geneexpressio-20) is at its best when it’s on its “keep American great” theme. Basically, a muscular argument for Left-liberal nationalism. When the author, a liberal, makes an argument aimed at other liberals where they may shy away at first blush from the thesis, he brings his “A-game.” It’s less persuasive to someone like me, on the Right, in many areas where I am skeptical. But in the end, I don’t think this is a book aimed at the center-Right, as opposed to the center-Left.

[Coronavirus Is Back With a Vengeance in Places Where It Had All but Vanished:  
Hong Kong, Japan and Australia are seeing new waves of infections after relaxing Covid-19 restrictions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-is-back-with-a-vengeance-in-places-where-it-had-all-but-vanished-11595842202). What else is there to say? It’s not an apocalypse. But neither is “back to normal.”

[Olivia de Havilland, Golden Age Star Who Challenged Hollywood’s Studio Powers, Has Died at 104](https://www.wsj.com/articles/olivia-de-havilland-old-hollywoods-combative-survivor-has-died-at-104-11595782155?mod=hp_lead_pos9). If you look at the list of “Golden Age” movie stars, it’s June Lockhart and Angela Lansbury. And neither of them has the same star power. An era is done and buried. Literally.

[These Monkeys Were Once Revered. Now They Are Taking Over](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/world/asia/thailand-monkeys.html). The weirdest part of the story seems to be that monkeys suffer from the same physical consequences as humans from eating junk food.

[Adaptive divergence of meiotic recombination rate in ecological speciation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219576v1?rss=1). Always fascinated by molecular genetic influences on macroscale phenomena.

[China Is Harvesting the DNA of Its People. Is This the Future of Policing?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/opinion/china-dna-police.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)

[Fine-scale genomic analyses of admixed individuals reveal unrecognized genetic ancestry components in Argentina](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233808). It’s been a bit since I looked into genetic ancestry in Latin America. One reason is that due to finances Latin American researchers often used AIMs. But now that they are moving to denser SNP-arrays it looks like they are revealing the fact that indigenous ancestry is pretty ubiquitous in Argentina, which views itself as a white settler nation.

[Evaluation of model fit of inferred admixture proportions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32323416/).

[The genetic architecture of the sexually selected sword ornament and its evolution in hybrid populations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.218164v1?rss=1).

[China Will Answer ‘Heavenly Question’: Can It Land on Mars?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/science/china-mars-mission.html) Some Chinese science concerns me. Some does not. This is in the latter camp.

[Planned Parenthood in N.Y. Disavows Margaret Sanger Over Eugenics](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/nyregion/planned-parenthood-margaret-sanger-eugenics.html).

[White men’s privilege in emerging economies isn’t measured. It should be](https://theconversation.com/white-mens-privilege-in-emerging-economies-isnt-measured-it-should-be-75557). “If you bring a Western guy … then they really feel important, so if I come in there I almost feel like a God.”

[Washington Post settles \$250M suit with Covington teen Nick Sandmann](https://nypost.com/2020/07/24/washington-post-settles-250m-suit-with-covington-teen-nick-sandmann/?__twitter_impression=true).

[Growing Up Indojin](https://www.thejuggernaut.com/growing-up-indojin?mc_cid=a557648de0&mc_eid=4ea78a02af). This is about Indians who grew up in Japan.

[Generalized Hidden Markov Models for Phylogenetic Comparative Datasets](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.209874v1?rss=1).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/universityweneed.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/universityweneed.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0742NGHS1/geneexpressio-20)So a quick comment: **academia, like the media is getting way more self-consciously “Left”.** This makes a lot of academics very happy, though less happy are the moderate liberals who in their bones wonder if this is not right. But, because of the intense “bubble-thought” many academics are not willing to entertain the reality that ideological polarization and “taking sides” by a mostly public-funded institution is not going to end well when 50% of the public is alienated. Additionally, academics want to have some influence, but being politically biased means that half the public is going to automatically ignore your advice. Why wouldn’t they? They feel you have total contempt for them, and that’s actually true.

The generation of graduate students and faculty who have come up in the “Great Awokening” after 2015 are much more radical and intolerant of Right Deviationism. But, they haven’t changed the structure of how they get funded, which still depends on the public purse. This is not sustainable.
