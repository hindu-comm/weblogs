Dingoes in Holocene Australia

It’s open access, [Genomic regions under selection in the feralization of the dingoes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14515-6#:~:text=Dingoes%20are%20wild%20canids%20living%20in%20Australia%2C%20originating%20from%20domestic%20dogs.&text=Our%20results%20indicate%20that%20the,adaptation%20to%20a%20wild%20environment.):

Our results indicate that the feralization of the dingo induced positive selection on genomic regions correlated to neurodevelopment, metabolism and reproduction, in adaptation to a wild environment.

The selection analysis is probably correct on some level, but I’m not sure this paper changes my priors much. The problem is **so much of the analysis is based on the sequences of *European* dogs as your reference population.** They allude to this issue in the paper. Also, research groups using ancient DNA are suggesting that the separation and domestication of dogs from the broader wolf lineage is more complex and episodic than we thought a decade ago. Basically, I assume that feralization is going on, but the details are to be worked out. We need to understand the context of Asian dogs better than we do now.

That being said, the 8,300 date is interesting. In the paper, they use both mtDNA and whole-genome sequences to come to this conclusion. One should be careful about taking genomic dating too literally, but this is 5,000 years earlier than the fossils we have in Australia. Nevertheless, the phylogeny is interesting, as the dingos are where you’d expect. They’re a clade with New Guinea singing dogs. And then it’s Indonesian dogs. And finally, it’s along with Southeast Asian dogs.

If the dingos came to Australia 8,000 years ago, then that’s well before agriculture. And, it is evidence of maritime connections between hunter-gatherer populations.

Or, the divergence could be evidence of “deep structure” within Southeast Asia. That is, these various lineages were separate and diversified before being dispered more recently.

In either case, these are important questions.
