A possible reason for inter-regional differences in COVID-19 prevalence?

There have been striking differences in COVID-19 severity/penetration by region. There are all sorts of reasons posited. This post from Derek Lowe at [In The Pipeline](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/15/new-data-on-t-cells-and-the-coronavirus), [New Data on T Cells and the Coronavirus](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/15/new-data-on-t-cells-and-the-coronavirus), suggests a possibility:

I’ll reiterate the point of that post here: antibody profiling (while very important) is not the whole story, and we need to know what we’re missing.

It seems that later we will find out that perhaps the Vietnamese benefited from some immunity conferred by a previous asymptomatic coronavirus outbreak? If you’ve been following [Spencer Wells](https://twitter.com/spwells) (more specifically, [here](https://twitter.com/spwells/status/1272255780377497602?s=20), [here](https://twitter.com/spwells/status/1269462131151302657?s=20), and [here](https://twitter.com/spwells/status/1269462131151302657?s=20) on the general hypotheses) on Twitter you know he’s been suggesting this for several months. The pattern seems to extend to neighboring nations too.
