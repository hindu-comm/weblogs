The plan write now is to review the book somewhere, and interview the author for *The Insight*. I may write something earlier about WEIRD though less specifically about the book.

I have set up an account on [Book Shop](https://bookshop.org/lists/razib-khan-s-must-read-history-book-list). Right now I put up a few history books. This is a better deal for me in regards to referrals than Amazon, though these are physical books only.

I haven’t been posting “Open Threads” as much because I’ve been busy. Sorry-not-sorry. Life happens. Though blogs are dead, my [Brown Pundits](https://www.brownpundits.com/) blog is pulling in more than 200+ comments for each open thread. I wonder if people are tired of “discussing” on Twitter.
