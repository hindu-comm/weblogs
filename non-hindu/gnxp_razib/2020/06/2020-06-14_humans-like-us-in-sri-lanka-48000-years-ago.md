Humans like us in Sri Lanka 48,000 years ago

[Bows and arrows and complex symbolic displays 48,000 years ago in the South Asian tropics](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaba3831):

As one of the oldest H. sapiens rainforest sites outside of Africa, this exceptional assemblage provides the first detailed insights into how our species met the extreme adaptive challenges that were encountered in Asia during global expansion.

The most interesting aspect of this is that it is pretty close (a few thousand years earlier) to the date for the [arrival of modern humans in Europe](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/05/12/the-great-explosion-across-the-world-island/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-great-explosion-across-the-world-island&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-great-explosion-across-the-world-island). The admixture with Neanderthals seems to be about 10,000 years earlier than this date, while that with Denisovans around this date. Something happened around 50,000 years ago, as a group of modern humans in and around the Near East seem to have radiated rapidly all across Eurasia, and later Oceania.

I assume that modern(ish) humans were present in Southeast Asia, but most of the ancestry dates to this period and pulse. A decade ago I might posit some incredible biological change, but cultural innovations in the Holocene triggered massive demographic shifts. There’s no reason the same couldn’t apply to the Pleistocene.
