Were ancestral human languages tonal?

But the 2000s turned into the 2010s, and I kind of lost interest. There was some really strange result though that ASPM and tonal languages had some association. But there are all sorts of weird correlations. Nevertheless, in 2012 [a study of Europeans](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034243) found those with a particular ASPM allele were better at recognizing particular tones.

Curiouser and Curioser. Now in *Science*, a new study of Cantonese speakers, [ASPM-lexical tone association in speakers of a tone language: Direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/22/eaba5090):

> How language has evolved into more than 7000 varieties today remains a > question that puzzles linguists, anthropologists, and evolutionary > scientists. The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution > postulates that genes and language features coevolve, such that a > population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular > linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language. > Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants > and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also > specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone. > However, there is currently no direct evidence for this association > and, therefore, the hypothesis. In an experimental study, we provide > evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over > 400 speakers of a tone language. In addition to providing the first > direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis, our results have > implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and > language disorders.

On the first reading of this paper I thought back to Terrence Deacon’s [The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005Q65DLY/geneexpressio-20). Deacon takes a different tack that Steven Pinker in [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061336467/geneexpressio-20), emphasizing that language emerges out of a gradual co-evolutionary dynamic, rather than being a distinct cognitive module that is “purpose-built” for the task. Deacon (and, to be fair Pinker and the Chomskyite tradition in general) emphasizes that the nature of linguistic phenomena is constrained and shaped by our neuro-cognitive architecture.

The authors seem to think their result has evolutionary implications:

> In conclusion, we found direct evidence of gene-tone association, > providing the critical direct evidence for the genetic-biasing > hypothesis of language evolution. We hypothesize that ASPM is > expressed in the pitch center of the auditory cortex (20), which > would, in turn, enhance the lexical tone perception of carriers of the > favored allele. Populations with a higher frequency of the favored > allele would be more likely to have lexical tone in their language.

Al well and good. But we need to take a step back, as I did after reading the paper. First, **the tone-enhancing T allele is the major allele in humans, and seems to be the ancestral one.** In fact, the T allele is at a much higher frequency in Africa than it does in East Asia. You can confirm this in the [1000 Genomes Browser](http://uswest.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;r=1:197101067-197102067;v=rs41310927;vdb=variation;vf=7035967#population_freq_EUR), but I also generated some frequencies from the HGDP:

Basically, the C allele is a West/South Eurasian allele. But, it’s also found at low frequencies within Africa. It could be that the C and T allele have been “balanced” in some way in human populations for al ong time. Who knows, perhaps the C allele is benefit, or hitchhiked with something else? It’s interesting that the Karitiana and Surui don’t even carry the C allele.

This is a functionally interesting gene, but I’m not sure what the SNP tells us about tonal vs. non-tonal in a deep way.
