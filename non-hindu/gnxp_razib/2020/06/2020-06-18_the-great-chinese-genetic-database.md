The great Chinese genetic database

[China Is Collecting DNA From Tens of Millions of Men and Boys, Using U.S. Equipment](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html):

> The police in China are collecting blood samples from men and boys > from across the country to build a genetic map of its roughly 700 > million males, giving the authorities a powerful new tool for their > emerging high-tech surveillance state. >
> They have swept across the country since late 2017 to collect enough > samples to build a vast DNA database, according to a new study > published on Wednesday by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a > research organization, based on documents also reviewed by The New > York Times. With this database, the authorities would be able to track > down a man’s male relatives using only that man’s blood, saliva or > other genetic material. >
> An American company, Thermo Fisher, is helping: The Massachusetts > company has sold testing kits to the Chinese police tailored to their > specifications. American lawmakers have criticized Thermo Fisher for > selling equipment to the Chinese authorities, but the company has > defended its business.

I don’t have much to say, though you should read the piece. This is a vision of a particular future. I am obviously concerned, but I think I have to frankly “grade on a curve” here. The Chinese state already has an incredible amount of power and control over its citizens. The genetic angle is much more of a movement on the margins than a qualitative change in anything. Genes are not magic, but phone tracking is.

As for the involvement of American companies, I don’t know what to say. Have you stopped buying Chinese products?
