Ambiguity in self-classification of ancestry and its problem with disease risk

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C7S753I/geneexpressio-20)[Genetic ancestry analysis on \>93,000 individuals undergoing expanded carrier screening reveals limitations of ethnicity-based medical guidelines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-0869-3):

It’s long been known that a certain percentage of people for various reasons give an ethnic background that doesn’t match their total genome. This is a problem because of the frequency of carriers varies by population. I first began to be curious about this issue 15 years ago. **Today there is no excuse in my opinion for not genotyping if you are a hospital.**

The wholesale costs of SNP-arrays are \$25, and there are pretty simple turn-key ancestry inference algorithms. This doesn’t need to be an issue. This is 2020.
