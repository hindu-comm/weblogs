Real New Atheism Has Never Been Tried

This is pretty interesting, though no longer shocking. It illustrates the reality that the future of religion is hard to predict. In 1994 Barry Kosmin in [One Nation Under God: Religion in Contemporary American Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004G8PG56//geneexpressio-20) reported findings from an early 1990s survey that the United States was a very religious nation amongst other developed nations, and that the 1960s decline in church attendance had trailed off. In fact, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the newsweeklies would publish credulous stories about the revival of American religion. Samuel P. Huntington’s last book, written in the early 2000s, [Who Are We?: The Challenges to America’s National Identity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684870541//geneexpressio-20), assumes the general findings of Kosmin’s earlier work, and extrapolates it forward, arguing that America’s foundational Protestant religion would remain a unifying force.

In the early 2000s, Kosmin’s group began seeing evidence of the second wave of secularization. The Robert D. Putnam book, [American Grace](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416566732//geneexpressio-20), written at the end of the 2000s, offers up a reason for this dynamic. In short, Putnam and his coauthor argue that the association of religion with conservative politics turned off many liberals from religion as an institution. Obviously this cannot be the total answer, as Republicans have also become more secular of late. But I think it gets to some of the issues that religion has as a “brand” in the United States. Religion is not about religion as such, but a whole lifestyle.

Pew’s data shows that the process continued after 2010. Whereas when I was a child \~10% or so of the American population had “No Religion,” today that figure is closer to \~25%. Pew reports that there are modest increases for the proportion in the 2010s.

What would the New Atheists from the period between 2005-2010 think about all this? Some of them are still around. Do they see a world lit by rationality? I don’t think the world is rational at all. **We’ve seen a collapse of Christianity, but not the rise of scientific materialism**.

The religious instincts are still there. By this, I mean basic religious instincts, not the details of religious phenomenon.

In the 1990s many of us thought that the internet would open up a whole new world of information, a world of enlightenment and communication. **You could talk to the whole world!**

Similarly, the New Atheists suggest that we just imagine there is no god, a world without Jesus. We are not in that world, but far closer than we might have expected in 2006.

I will finish with a comment from a reader:

This gets at something real. The 2020s will be “interesting.”
