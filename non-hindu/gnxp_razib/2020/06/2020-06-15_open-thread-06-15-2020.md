This book, by Joe Henrich, doesn’t come out until early September, but hopefully I can get Henrich on [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) to talk about it around the release date. Long-time readers know I’ve appreciated Henrich’s work. If you haven’t, I would highly recommend his earlier book, [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WY4OXAS/geneexpressio-20).

The core of the book is the argument in the paper [The Church, intensive kinship, and global psychological variation](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6466/eaau5141).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/secretofoursuccess.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/secretofoursuccess.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WY4OXAS/geneexpressio-20)Even ten years ago a book arguing that Western prosperity might be due to the cultural and historical peculiarities of the Western Christian Church would be a bit “edgy”, insofar as economic differences between the “West and the rest” were often chalked up in mainstream elite circles as due to exploitation. In 2020 a book like this seems really out of place, especially with the current mood and its attitudes toward institutions associated with the West.

[Stories and Data](https://www.city-journal.org/reflections-on-race-riots-and-police). [Coleman Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman_Hughes) is 24. He’s a really impressive thinker.

[The Ancient DNA Insights into Aboriginal Australian Mortuary Practices](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.145482v1) Y and mtDNA. Hopefully more of this.

[Ross Douthat: The Tom Cotton Op-Ed and the Cultural Revolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/nyt-tom-cotton-oped-liberalism.html). Some of my academic friends dismiss the changes happening within their institution. I happen to know for a fact that many people are engaging in preference falsification and terrified that they’ll be targeted or denounced. Perhaps these people are paranoid, and the reigning grandees of justice are in fact tolerant and big-hearted souls, but they’re real people.

[Statue of Leopold II, Belgian King Who Brutalized Congo, Is Removed in Antwerp](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/world/europe/king-leopold-statue-antwerp.html). If you read [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004KZOWEG/geneexpressio-20) you will get the sense that what he did in this time was horrifying to contemporaries.

[Seminal fluid protein divergence among populations exhibiting postmating prezygotic reproductive isolation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.08.140020v1).

[The production of within-family inequality: Insights and implications of integrating genetic data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.137778v1). The implication here seems to be that “within family environment” isn’t uniform. Parents invest more in children who need more resources?
