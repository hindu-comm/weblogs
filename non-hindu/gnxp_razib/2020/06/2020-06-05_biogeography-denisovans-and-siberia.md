Biogeography, Denisovans, and Siberia

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/densiberia.png?resize=640%2C478&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/densiberia.png?resize=640%2C478&ssl=1)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.131995v1)

A new ancient DNA preprint, this time using the sequence of a 34,000-year-old sample from Northeastern Mongolia. The preprint is [Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.131995v1):

> We present analyses of the genome of a \~34,000-year-old hominin skull > cap discovered in the Salkhit Valley in North East Mongolia. We show > that this individual was a female member of a modern human population > that, following the split between East and West Eurasians, experienced > substantial gene flow from West Eurasians. Both she and a > 40,000-year-old individual from Tianyuan outside Beijing carried > genomic segments of Denisovan ancestry. These segments derive from the > same Denisovan admixture event(s) that contributed to present-day > mainland Asians but are distinct from the Denisovan DNA segments in > present-day Papuans and Aboriginal Australians.

There are two major points in this preprint. First, as noted in the title, **this adds weight to the inference that there were multiple admixtures between “Denisovan” populations and the peoples of south and east Eurasia.** I put Denisovan in quotations because there is more and more evidence now that this was a diverse and variegated lineage of humans, not a simple classification such as Neanderthals, who often seem to have been closely related due to periodic population bottlenecks. This individual carries segments similar to the Altai Denisovan, and something different from the segments in the Papuans.

I think the second major aspect here is **east-west gene flow in Eurasia in a bidirectional sense**. It seems more and more likely that the “Ancient North Eurasians” (ANE) reflect two dynamics. First, the rapid expansion of an ancient West Eurasian branch of humans pushing up through the Near East and into Central Asia, and then Siberia, very early. Second, the assimilation and admixture with a minority element of incipient East Asian populations pushing up from the south. Though the trend was patchy and uneven, eventually the East Asian ancestral component kept increasing, until you have “Neo-Siberian” modern populations which are overwhelmingly East Asian.

Why the difference? As with Denisovans, I think the answer is a function of biogeography. Though West Eurasians had an easier “straight shot,” East Asians had a much larger reservoir population near at hand to the south over the late Pleistocene. Over time this resulted in a difference, whereby Siberian populations become more and more East Asians, with relatively little influx of West Eurasian genes until the Russian colonization.
