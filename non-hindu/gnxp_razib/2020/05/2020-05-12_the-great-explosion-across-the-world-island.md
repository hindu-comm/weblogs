The great explosion across the World Island

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005XMK898/geneexpressio-20)Last week I recorded an episode of [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) with Chris Stringer. The topic du jour mostly had to do with Denisovans…but now I wish I’d waited a week. There would have been more to talk about!

Two new papers have confirmed and solidified the **fact that modern humans expanded into Europe earlier than we had accepted.**

[A 14C chronology for the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition at Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1136-3), and [Initial Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2259-z). The authors dated a cave inhabited by individuals with modern human remains “to 45,820–43,650 cal BP (95.4% probability), probably beginning from 46,940 cal BP (95.4% probability).” And, they obtained mtDNA. The results established that these individuals were basal non-Africans of haplogroup M. Today there are very few West Eurasians, and almost no native Europeans, who carry haplogroup M, which is frequent in India and parts east. But this is not the first M found in Europe during the Pleistocene. The point though is that in concert with the results for Oase in Romania roughly contemporaneous (if perhaps somewhat later), they establish strongly that the **first modern humans in Europe did not leave descendants in the continent.**

This puts paid to the idea that the period of interaction between these two groups was short. The authors even suggest that Neanderthal archaeological cultures exhibit modern human influence.

On a broader scale, **these results bring balance and order back into the world**. One stylized fact that has long been fascinating is that Australia seems to have been occupied by modern humans 5-10,000 years earlier than Europe. A reasonable explanation for this fact is that Neanderthals occupied Europe. But humans, we now know, tend to engage, interact, and migrate. Though there are older dates, very high confidence results indicate that humans [reached Australia 49,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians#Migration_to_Australia). This site would be only 2,000 years later, and it seems plausible that this wasn’t the first.

The best genetic evidence now suggests that at minimum modern humans began to diversify 200,000 years ago in Africa, though it is more likely that some lineages branched out earlier. Among “non-Africans,” some groups may have separated earlier, the “Basal Eurasians” (they may have less Neanderthal than the other non-Africans). But the majority expanded explosively \~50,000 years ago. These are the ancestors of European Pleistocene and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, and Oceanians, East Asians, and other eastern peoples.

Mitochondrial DNA is copious, so easy to extract. But often after mtDNA comes autosomal DNA. So hoping, hoping…
