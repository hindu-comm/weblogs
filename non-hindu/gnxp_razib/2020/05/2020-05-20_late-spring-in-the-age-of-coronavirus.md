Late spring in the age of coronavirus

I haven’t posted on COVID-19 in a while. What’s there to say? The last month or so has been a great muddle. We soldier on, without purpose or direction. At least here in the United States of America. In regards to the pandemic, we’re in, all I can say is that I feel a sense of listless ennui. But perhaps I should say something, just for historical purposes of tracking where we’re at for this weblog?

On March 23th, T. A. Frank mentioned me in [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/why-some-early-maga-adopters-went-against-trumps-virus-doctrine) as being a COVID-hawk. You can search this weblog and note I was relatively sanguine at the end of January, but we began to stockpile in early February. By the middle of February, I was alarmed. On February [19th news broke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Iran#Early_cases_(19_February_%E2%80%93_23_February)) that Covid-19 was spreading Iran, and to be frank I flipped out.

Between February 20th and March 10th, there was a slow and gradual shift in thinking. But the real switch was flipped between March 10th and March 15th, as broad swaths of the culture moved into a high state of alarmism. It was curious seeing scientists who I followed who were fixated on Richard Dawkins in February joining the alarm about Covid-19. When they’d give a thought many (though not as many privately!) were reassuring.

They shouldn’t have been.

Some considerations and observations:

**The COVID-doves:** early in the pandemic there were critics who were accusing me of alarmism. This was March, so who knew? I asked for some numbers. One individual said that **at most** there would be 20,000 deaths. We are around 100,000 now. Over time the initial wave of skeptics faded away because the numbers were too high.

But, the second round of skeptics emerged. The interesting thing here though is that the second wave of skeptics was more focused on the opportunity costs of the lock-down. The key problem I have with this wave of COVID-doves is that I wish they would just admit that 250,000 miserable deaths may be the price we have to pay. Perhaps. We just need to put the numbers on the table and remember that the deaths seem quite unpleasant and protracted.

I am on friendly terms with many COVID-doves. I disagree with them, but I have friends and many who are liberals too, and I disagree with them. In fact, in an ideal world, I would be convinced by their arguments, and become a COVID-dove. I am not convinced by their arguments. Yet.

There is a broader class of COVID-skeptic which is, to be frank, unhinged, conspiratorial, and a promoter of misinformation. This is a serious problem.

**The** **COVID-hysterics**: another class of individuals are those who are hysterical about the impact of COVID. They want a two-year-long lockdown. They believe that the governor of Georgia has blood on his hands. They believe that COVID could kill anyone! Any skepticism or cost-vs.-benefit thinking is anathema to the COVID-hysteric.

The data is clear now that COVID-19 is particularly dangerous for older people. But the number of media profiles of young women who die of COVID-19 is quite high. There is, to my mind, a clear attempt by the media to make it seem like everyone is at risk. In fact, for people in their 20s and younger the seasonal flu seems to be more risk. The spate of stories about Kawasaki disease and children is, in my opinion, part of the issue. To convince COVID-skeptics those who wish people to take this pandemic seriously need to not exaggerate, or they’ll lose all credibility.

**The IFR**: I now believe that the infection fatality rate in the United States is around 0.75%. This is, as the above comment should make clear, not unconditional. For the young, it is quite low. For the aged, it is much higher. But when estimating how many Americans may die of COVID-19, this is the number that I think is reasonable. Perhaps higher. Perhaps lower. But this it the ballpark. If 50% of Americans become infected, that’s 1.2 million or so deaths. The IFR, like the R, is not a fixed parameter. Perhaps the virus will change. Perhaps our therapeutics will get better. But we go to war with the parameters we have, not the ones we want.

**The uncertainty:** There is still a great deal of uncertainty as we proceed forward. We know some things (e.g., no, children are not at high risk of death), but not enough. I have stopped paying attention to whether the weather impacts COVID-19. I think it does, but more in the range of 25-50% changes in the R, not an order of magnitude. There are lots of small things that are having impacts that we don’t know. And there are likely stochastic factors as well. We look through the mirror darkly.

Perhaps COVID-19 will fade away. Burn itself out. But that’s hope. A guess. We have no idea. We’re still not clear why the outbreak in New York City was so much worse on the West coast of the USA. Why Southeast Asia has been left relatively unscathed.

**The quarantine**: The major lacunae in the Western response has been quarantine-containment. The lockdown has, on the whole, not taken COVID-19 positive people, and put them in some sort of quarantine. It doesn’t look like it will happen.

That means COVID-19 is endemic. For now.

**Where are we?** It looks like as we move into fall the number of American deaths will be in the low 100,000s. This is a victory, after a fashion. My family is still self-quarantining. We have no date when we’re not going to keep doing this, at least for the foreseeable future. My children have grandparents that they want to see. What are we supposed to do? But the day will come when we go back out into the world…
