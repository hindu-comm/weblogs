Complex history of archaic ancestry

[On the Apportionment of Archaic Human Diversity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452563v1):

We find that archaic genome > coverage at the individual- and population-level present unique > patterns in modern human population: South Asians have an elevated > count of population-unique archaic SNPs, and Europeans and East Asians > have a higher degree of archaic SNP sharing, indicating that > population demography and archaic admixture events had distinct > effects in these populations. We confirm previous observations that > East Asians have more Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans at an > individual level, but surprisingly Europeans have more Neandertal > ancestry at a population level. In comparing these results to our simulated models, we conclude that these patterns likely reflect a complex series of interactions between modern humans and archaic populations.

The method is pretty neat. Read this closely. Here are some takeaways:

– European Neanderthal ancestry is lower than East Asian, but more diverse

– South Asians clearly have different Denisovan ancestry than East Asians

– Population structure matters…South Asian rare allele frequency is due to admixture between divergence groups

Basically, Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture is more complex than our simple stylized models.
