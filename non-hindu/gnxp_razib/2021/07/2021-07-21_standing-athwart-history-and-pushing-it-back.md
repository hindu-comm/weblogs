Standing athwart history and pushing it back

Recently [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/26/the-german-experiment-that-placed-foster-children-with-pedophiles) had a long feature on the German social experiment from the 1970’s to early 2000’s which placed homeless boys in foster care with pedophiles. The whole thing seems totally incomprehensible today. But, **I always explain to adults who don’t remember the sexual environment of the 1970’s that pedophilia was a much more open question on the radical fringes then than today.** I point out that Allen Ginsberg and Harry Hay were both [pro-NAMBLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association#Associated_individuals). Ginsberg is still a cultural figure, but Hay was a huge mover and shaker in the gay liberation movement of the 20th century. The basic radical theory is that children had sexual rights and feelings which were being repressed.

But this is an intellectual matter. What was happening “on the ground”? I decided to look back into the archives of *The New York Times*, and I stumbled upon the fact that in the late 1970’s **New Jersey had reduced the age of consent to 13, before moving it back to 16 in 1979.** The reasons for this are complicated and have to do with the implicit criminalization of sex between teens and Romeo and Juliet laws, but the way the legislation was written it seems it was legal for adults to have sex with 13-year-old teens in New Jersey for a time in the late 1970s.

Here is the article, [Age of Consent in Jersey Expected to Revert to 16](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/03/archives/age-of-consent-in-jersey-expected-to-revert-to-16-jersey-debating.html?searchResultPosition=1):

> Leaders of the New Jersey Assembly, responding to widespread fears > about a new criminal code that lowers the age of sexual consent to 13 years, said today they expected the Assembly to pass a stopgap measure tomorrow to restore 16 as the age of consent. The legislators hope to allay fears that the state is endorsing sexual activity by teen‐agers. >
> The reduced age of consent had been included in the criminal code, > which takes effect Sept. 1, at the urging of the **National > Organization for Women**. An official of the organization, Roberta Kaufman, said it had lobbied for making the age of consent 13 not to encourage sex among young teen‐agers, but to keep teen‐agers under 16 from becoming entangled in the law if they did engage in sex.

Reading the archives from that period a lot of things were on the table. Apparently, New Jersey was [looking to legalize](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/30/archives/new-jersey-opinion-trentons-policy-on-sexuality-is-laissezfaire.html?searchResultPosition=6) incest between adults over the age of 16 and necrophilia.

Perhaps the current radical cultural moment will pass too, and we’ll forget all about it?
