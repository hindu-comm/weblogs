Stem-human gene flow into Neanderthals

[The evolutionary history of human spindle genes includes back-and-forth gene flow with Neandertals](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.29.470407v1.full.pdf):

The standard model is that 500-750,000 years ago the ancestors of African (modern) stem humans and Neandersovans diverged, and that’s that before the recent admixture and assimilation. But it’s pretty clear there were contacts between stem lineage and Neandersovans before the recent expansion of the African lineage. Neanderthals acquired lots of neat genes from our lineage, and we probably acquired stuff from them too.

(note that I think there were old modern lineages that disappeared)
