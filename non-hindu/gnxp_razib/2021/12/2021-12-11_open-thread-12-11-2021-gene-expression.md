The author is really fixated on retroflex consonants, but she’s also aware of the latest archaeogenetic work. It’s a pretty academic work, and if you aren’t interested in questions like how Sanskrit evolved along with early Dravidian languages, it’s not for you, but I think Mohan’s book illustrates a possible future for synthetic interdisciplinary research. I’d like to see more of this.

[Defund the Police Meets the Crime Wave](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/p/defund-the-police-meets-the-crime). Crime is coming close to my friend’s Leighton Woodhouse’s life (he lives in Oakland). It looks like the Democrats really want the Republicans to win again on “tough on crime.” This shit is not sustainable.

There is now a TV series based on[*The Wheel of Time*](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002U3CCYM/geneexpressio-20). I haven’t read these books since I was a literal teenager, and I do not personally feel the source material is rich enough to really produce anything comparable to*Game of Thrones*. Obscure fact: this series is set in*our*far future, in a post-apocalyptic world.

[The Man in the Lineup – Alice Sebold’s best-selling account of her own rape was headed for the big screen. Then the film’s unlikely producer started asking questions](https://airmail.news/issues/2021-12-11/the-man-in-the-lineup?utm_medium=email&utm_source=blast&utm_campaign=standard-2021-12-10). The author of *The Lovely Bones* isn’t going to live this down.

We talked for nearly an hour and a half; there is a lot to talk about. Please rate the podcast on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/razib-khans-unsupervised-learning/id1542136715?ls=1) or [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/show/razib-khans-unsupervised-learning). One thing Charles mentioned to me privately is that it was fun to talk to me because I’d read his books and actually knew his writing. That struck me as funny, but it’s not like I’m Terry Gross, I don’t just talk to*anyone*. Usually, I am interested in talking to the person for a reason.
