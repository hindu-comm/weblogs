Ten Thousand Years of Patriarchy

Alice Evans has a long write-up of some of her ideas about the origins of patriarchy, [Ten Thousand Years of Patriarchy](https://www.draliceevans.com/post/ten-thousand-years-of-patriarchy-1):

> Patriarchy has persisted for at least ten millennia. > Cereal-cultivation, the plough and irrigation increased agricultural yields, enabling a taxable surplus, state-formation and social stratification across much of Eurasia. Land and herds were inherited by men, who maintained lineage purity by guarding women. >
> Eurasia then underwent an important divergence. South Asia and the > Middle East saw tightening endogamy (caste and cousin marriage), > alongside religious authoritarianism. The more visible the woman, the > greater the suspicion and moral ambiguity. By preventing rumour, men > preserved piety, honour, and inclusion within vital kinship networks. > East Asia remained exogamous, while Europe became increasingly > nuclear, democratic, and scientific. But as long as women laboured on family farms (lacking both economic independence and their own social organisations), this global variation in kinship, institutions and religion may not have made an enormous difference.

I was one of the people Alice corresponded with, so I knew the general outlines, but this is a massively interesting effort, and work in progress.
