Recommended.

I’ve been too busy to do an “Open Thread” and now that I do stuff similar for my Substack…well, you know the drill. That being said, [South & SC Asian neolithic ancestry in Steppe Eneolithic](https://a-genetics.blogspot.com/2021/11/steppe-eneolithic.html). The big issue here is the space of graphs is big. Is this the best option? Sarazm seems to post-date the emergence of the proto-Yamnaya genetic matrix as outlined by David Anthony in his interview with me.

Also, I’m going to block some people who seem to have started trolling if you don’t stop (you know who you are, you are not a regular).

Finally, anyone have suggestions for people I should have on the podcast? I have a lot recorded already…
