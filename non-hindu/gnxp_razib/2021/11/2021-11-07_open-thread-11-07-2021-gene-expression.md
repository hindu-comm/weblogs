Open Thread – 11/07/2021 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/americancatholicism.jpg?resize=188%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/americancatholicism.jpg?resize=188%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195168852//geneexpressio-20)In the mid-2000’s I read a bunch of books on the history of Catholicism in the US. One of the most memorable of those books was Jay P Dolan’s In Search of an [American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195168852//geneexpressio-20).

If you haven’t, please [write a positive review of the *Unsupervised Learning* podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/). The more positive reviews, the better it is for exposure, etc. etc.

Some links on the [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/p/rkul-a-little-light-reading-october) too. Also, a new paid piece, [Heritability of height: the long and the short of it](https://razib.substack.com/p/heritability-of-height-the-long-and). Using genetics to make historical and cultural inferences are popular, obviously, but the interplay between genetics and evolution are just as interesting to me. Obviously.

Most of the discussion focused on his book, [Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B088FQK2K2/geneexpressio-20). I’m generally pro-Musk, so I recommend the book. If you want a negative treatment, just read the rest of the media!

[Replace the Proposed New California Math Curriculum Framework – Open Letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, the State Board of Education, and the Instructional Quality Commission](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=13658). This is a “whitepill.” Lots of people I respect on this list, even people with a reputation as being very much on the Left.
