The genetics of Southeast Asia gets more complex…

[Ancient genomes from the last three millennia support multiple human dispersals into Wallacea](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.05.467435v1):

> Previous research indicates that the human genetic diversity found in > Wallacea – islands in present-day Eastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste > that were never part of the Sunda or Sahul continental shelves – has > been shaped by complex interactions between migrating Austronesian > farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherer communities. Here, we provide > new insights into this region’s demographic history based on > genome-wide data from 16 ancient individuals (2600-250 yrs BP) from > islands of the North Moluccas, Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara. While > the ancestry of individuals from the northern islands fit earlier > views of contact between groups related to the Austronesian expansion > and the first colonization of Sahul, the ancestry of individuals from > the southern islands revealed additional contributions from Mainland > Southeast Asia, which seems to predate the Austronesian admixture in > the region. Admixture time estimates for the oldest individuals of > Wallacea are closer to archaeological estimates for the Austronesian > arrival into the region than are admixture time estimates for > present-day groups. The decreasing trend in admixture times exhibited > by younger individuals supports a scenario of multiple or continuous > admixture involving Papuan- and Asian-related groups. Our results clarify previously debated times of admixture and suggest that the Neolithic dispersals into Island Southeast Asia are associated with the spread of multiple genetic ancestries.

This paper is hard to parse. But here are my takeaways

– the samples in this study do not seem particularly closely related to the [7,000 years old sample from Sulawesi](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03823-6)

– there was likely an earlier mainland migration into Wallacea of Austro-Asiatic speaking people

– gene flow seems to have been reoccurrent from the east, in western Melanesia, as well as from Austronesians to the northeast
