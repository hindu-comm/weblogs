Popularism is probably stillborn

[Democrats Thought They Bottomed Out in Rural, White America. It Wasn’t the Bottom](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/us/rural-vote-democrats-virginia.html):

> Republicans have never had a demographic stronghold as reliable as > Black voters have been for Democrats, a group that delivers as many as nine out of 10 votes for the party. But some Democratic leaders are now sounding the alarm: What if rural, white voters — of which there are many — start voting that reliably Republican? >

> “In rural America the bottom for the Democratic Party is zero,” said Ethan Winter, a senior analyst at the group Data for Progress, who studies voter behavior. “I am serious about this.” >

> Rural, white voters in the past in the North had historic ties to the labor movement and an affinity for the Democratic Party. Increasingly, Mr. Winter said, those voters are more akin culturally to their neighbors to the South than to their local cities and suburbs. >
> Tom Bonier, one of the Democratic Party’s leading experts on voter data and the chief executive of TargetSmart, agreed. “You look at places in the Deep South where the white, rural vote is approaching 90 percent Republican,” he said. “That’s absolutely the concern.”

I actually looked up the Presidential year results from the county I grew up in eastern Oregon, and it doesn’t seem that the Democrats have really eroded much. They still get about 25-30% of the vote every election, which was the case a generation ago. So that suggests that the Deep South model does not hold everywhere, though it may apply to the Border States.

It is pretty obvious from reading *The New York Times* piece that there is no way that the Democrats are in a position to address the cultural concerns of rural America. Twenty years ago the Democratic whip in the House was [David Bonior](https://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/102502/102502l.htm), who believed Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided. That sort of stance would be a non-starter for any Democrat except at the most local level now.

It seems likely that Democrats will be competitive at the national-Presidential level, but the way the Senate is apportioned and the ability to pack urban districts in a first-past-the-post system means they’ll have problems in the future winning Congress unless they reposition themselves culturally, which I’m bearish on.

In *Bloomberg* Matt Yglesias makes the case for a repositioning, [The nation and the Democratic Party need a moderate president with populist tendencies and no particular affinity with the cultural left](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-07/reviving-biden-in-2022-will-require-recapturing-biden-of-2020?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=view). But he himself notes that the Democratic Party’s staff is just very culturally Left, and just like Donald Trump couldn’t control his administration due to personnel issues, so Biden would have the same problem. Also, we have a historical precedent for repositioning, Bill Clinton’s triangulation after 1994. But do a thought experiment and imagine Biden even attempting to do some of the policies Clinton executed on, like [Welfare Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act#:~:text=The%20Personal%20Responsibility%20and%20Work,law%20by%20President%20Bill%20Clinton.&text=After%20the%20passage%20of%20the,receiving%20federal%20welfare%20dramatically%20declined.).

Despite what we thought back then, the 1990’s were a culturally less polarized time.

(the main upside from a Democratic perspective is that the Republicans have not shown much ability to govern and legislate after winning elections)
