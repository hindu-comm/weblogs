China, Dzungars, and Uyghurs

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unsup.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unsup.jpeg?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1)](https://razib.substack.com/p/made-in-china)Long-time readers of this blog know I’m quite interested in the history of Central Asia. This region of the world is “back in the news.” The Uyghurs of the Tarim basin are in the eye of the storm, with the Chinese government’s totalitarian apparatus zeroed in on them.

But is this so surprising? I would say no. The northern half of Xinjiang is “Dzungaria”, named after a collection of groups called “Dzungar Mongols.” But very few Mongols live in Dzungaria today. This is because 250 years ago they were ethnically cleansed by the Manchu Empire. The Qing dynasty.

History leaves us with few surprises, alas.

For more on this particular topic, I have a Substack essay (free), [Made in China: Does it matter who writes history if no one reads it?](https://razib.substack.com/p/made-in-china) Please feel free to read and share, and if you are a [subscriber](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe) your comments are welcome.
