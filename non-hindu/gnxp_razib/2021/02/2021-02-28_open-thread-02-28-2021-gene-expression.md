The narrative is hard for me to keep track of. I wish there was more cultural/social commentary to scaffold the battles and forced marches. Will post on chapter 9 soon.

[NASA’s Perseverance Rover Lands on Mars to Renew Search for Extinct Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/science/nasa-peseverance-mars-landing.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

[Beyond the !Kung: A grand research project created our origin myth that early human societies were all egalitarian, mobile and small-scale](https://aeon.co/essays/not-all-early-human-societies-were-small-scale-egalitarian-bands).

[Books on deck in 2021 – Six books in the queue](https://razib.substack.com/p/books-on-deck-in-2021). Substack piece from me (it’s free, like my China one).

[Dinosaurs Rediscovered: The Scientific Revolution in Paleontology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07MFRBNC8/geneexpressio-20). A lot has happened since the 1980’s, and my kids are obsessed so I need to learn more.

I’m RazibKhan on Clubhouse. Follow me when you get on. I have a members-only “Club” I’m inviting my followers to. I’m going to use it to have conversations and “rooms”. But I can only add members in batches of 10-50 right now, so going through it manually. If you follow me on Clubhouse and want to be a member, just leave a comment with your handle, and I’ll add you manually.

If you haven’t read [Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101873469/geneexpressio-20) you should. People keep asking if I know of any books that talk about the topics that they’re interested in relating to history and ancient DNA, and this is the book. Still.
