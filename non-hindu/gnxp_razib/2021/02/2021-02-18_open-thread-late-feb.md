Open Thread – Late Feb.

I was busy. Then we lost power for days. So no updates on this blog. But a lot has happened while I’ve been trying to keep warm. Discuss. I have papers to read from what I can tell.

Follow me @razibkhan on Clubhouse. I have internet and plan on doing my usual 7 PM PDT event, this time on the genetics of Europe (and going to push through on the [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) post on Italy now).
