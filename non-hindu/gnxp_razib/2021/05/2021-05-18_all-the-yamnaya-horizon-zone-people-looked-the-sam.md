All the Yamnaya horizon zone people looked the same

The above figure is from [The Beaker Phenomenon and the Genomic Transformation of Northwest Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973796/). At the time I noted it because the Bell Beaker people who arrived \~2500 BC seem to have been darker than modern Britons. In particular, you can see that their frequencies are much lower at the blue/brown eye locus (HERC2/OCA2), and*SLC45A2*, where Europeans are 90% derived today and non-Europeans far less (less than 50% in the Middle East). In modern European populations, the Sardinians have the lowest fraction of the derived *SLC45A2*SNP that I’ve seen, around 60%, with mainland Spaniards being at 80%, the rest of Southern Europe at 90%, and 95% in Northern Europe. The Bell Beakers look to be in the low 60% range.

These numbers came back to me when I was looking at some supplementary excel sheets from [Genetic ancestry changes in Stone to Bronze Age transition in the East European plain](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/4/eabd6535). Here are the figures at these two SNPs for the Fatyanovo Culture of European Russia \~2500 BC:

OCA2/HER2 – 50%  
SLC45A2 – 62%

For the [Sintashta culture](https://www.brownpundits.com/2019/09/12/the-sintashta-were-swarthy/) from Russia/Urals \~2000 BC:

OCA2/HER2 – 42%  
SLC45A2 – 92%

For comparison, modern Estonians are 92% and 99% at these markers for the derived variant.

This reiterates something I’ve noticed in the data, **Bronze Age Europeans were not as “fair” as modern Europeans**. This is pretty evident in Northern Europe in particular since these populations are so fair contemporaneously. And, Bell Beakers and Fantyanovo looked basically the same in terms of pigmentation despite between on opposite ends of the post/para-Corded Ware horizon. Curiously, the Sintashta, who descend in a straight line from Fatyanovo seems to exhibit some selection on SLC45A2 (the sample size is pretty large).
