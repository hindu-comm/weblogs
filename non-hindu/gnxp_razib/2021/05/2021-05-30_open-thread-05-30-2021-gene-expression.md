The above video is from Eurovision. A bunch of 20-something Italians doing rock music is pretty weird, since rock is dead for all practical purposes in the USA.

I’ve been setting up some Amazon book lists. So here is one for [population genetics](https://www.amazon.com/shop/RazibKhan?listId=1QO1CCPYLOC3C). I also set them up for [the steppe](https://www.amazon.com/shop/RazibKhan?listId=3VDPMRXXQTESX), [Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/shop/RazibKhan?listId=22SAUW9QI114G), and [the origins of Islam](https://www.amazon.com/shop/RazibKhan?listId=3JZICJHXJ2U0V). I’ll be adding more lists and fleshing them out.

Lots of content on my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/). I assume most readers of this weblog are on the e-list, but who knows? Perhaps of note, [two](https://razib.substack.com/p/outcast-as-i-wanna-be) [posts](https://razib.substack.com/p/outcast-as-i-wanna-be-5fd) on the Romani. Also check out my interview with [J. P. Mallory](https://razib.substack.com/p/james-p-mallory-finding-the-indo).

The [ungated podcast site](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) has more than two dozen podcasts now. If you haven’t posted a review on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/razib-khans-unsupervised-learning/id1542136715?ls=1) or [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/show/razib-khans-unsupervised-learning), please do so.

Matt Yglesias does a forensic analysis of what happened.

I’m reading [Peace, Poverty and Betrayal](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1787383857/geneexpressio-20) for a review at [UnHerd](https://unherd.com/author/razib-khan/).

[Recent Common Origin, Reduced Population Size, and Marked Admixture Have Shaped European Roma Genomes](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/11/3175/5863255).

I’ve been corresponding with a reader who is of English Romanichal background, and my supposition that they have less South Asian ancestry than Roma and Iberian Romani seems correct. Closer to 10-15% than 20-30%. A lot of the ancestry (from Ancestry/Family Tree DNA) is assigned as British, so that indicates the dilution may have happened in the United Kingdom.

O. Wilson’s [Social Conquest of the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0074V3712/geneexpressio-20) is now \$2.99 on Kindle (don’t know how long this will last).

[The “noble lie” on masks probably wasn’t a lie: Why Western public health went all-in on a campaign against masks](https://lessonsfromthecrisis.substack.com/p/the-noble-lie-on-masks-probably-wasnt?r=u0rd&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter). Basically, they didn’t know what they were talking about, but their authority is based on the premise that they do. Also, the evidence in **favor** of masks isn’t really that strong, just like it wasn’t strong against them. People have polarized this issue in a way that’s crazy.

[Please, Think Critically About College Admissions: you can’t help the disadvantaged by refusing to engage in critical thinking](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/please-think-critically-about-college). This is nothing new to readers of this weblog, but the wave of mainstream-media propaganda around this issue is reading going to go into overdrive soon, so it is best to have the literature familiar to you (also, read [A Year Without Miles](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/digest-5292021-a-year-without-miles)).
