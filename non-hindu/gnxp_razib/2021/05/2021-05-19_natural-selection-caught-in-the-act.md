Natural selection caught in the act

[Analysis of genomic DNA from medieval plague victims suggests long-term effect of Yersinia pestis on human immunity genes](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab147/6277411#.YKWOS_widHg.twitter):

This isn’t surprising. But now that old DNA studies are getting cheap and mass-produced, I think people will be looking at changes in allele frequencies in the last 2,000 years a lot. More sophisticated methods for detecting natural selection either conclude or imply that sweeps are happening now, but this sort of study will confirm it (there’s evidence of natural selection in American Indians for obvious and unfortunate reasons).
