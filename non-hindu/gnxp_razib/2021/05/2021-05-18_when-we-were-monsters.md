When we were monsters

[Unraveling ancestry, kinship, and violence in a Late Neolithic mass grave](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/22/10705):

> In 2011, archaeological excavations near the village of Koszyce in > southern Poland uncovered a ca. 5,000-y-old mass grave…associated with > the Globular Amphora culture and containing the remains of 15 men, > women, and children who had been killed, but carefully buried with rich grave goods…Closer study of the skeletons…revealed that the individuals had all **been killed by blows to the head**, possibly during a raid on their settlement. >
> … >
> Interestingly, the older males/fathers are mostly missing from the grave, suggesting that it might have been them who buried their kin… >
> … >
> Although it is impossible to identify the culprits of the massacre > that took place at Koszyce around 2880–2776 BCE, **it is interesting > to note that it occurred right around the time when the Corded Ware > complex started to spread rapidly across large parts of Central > Europe**, and it seems plausible that the group from Koszyce fell > victim to some violent intergroup conflict related to the territorial > expansion of Corded Ware groups or another competing group in the > area. If the general interaction between Globular Amphora people and > neighboring, steppe-related cultures (including early Corded Ware) was primarily hostile, **it would explain why Globular Amphora individuals carry no steppe ancestry and, in part, why Europe experienced such a dramatic reduction in Neolithic genomic ancestry at this time**

The killings were like executions since there is no resistance as suggested by cuts to the upper body (where people are resisting). Additionally, the one woman who is not part of the kin group was killed somewhat differently and more deliberately.

Whatever the real story, I want to note that when the Corded Ware arrived in Northern Europe they were often buried with mace pendants. What do you do with maces?

I’ve read [War Before Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195119126/geneexpressio-20). I am aware that the Neolithic groups were quite violent. I am aware that the violence continued after the Corded Ware. But, reading about the Corded Ware reminds me a lot about reading about the Mongols during the time of Genghis Khan. They were effective.
