Recommended. The book is really about the *Golden Horde*, not the whole Mongol world, but it has a pretty international scope. Probably gets a little too much in the weeds about Jochid family internal politics, but that’s my main complaint (going to have a review up in [UnHerd](http://unherd.com/) soon).

[Our Three-Body Problem: China, India and the Rest](https://razib.substack.com/p/our-three-body-problem). A free piece on my Substack. There’s only so much I can put into a piece that’s this “short.” A major problem is that a lot of people don’t know much about multiple society’s histories, so most of the responses that are critical haven’t been too impressive. Lots of people who say there are lots of “howlers” but don’t bother to say what. I assume these are stupid people, but I honestly have no idea since they won’t say what!

Also, another piece on my Substack, [The ultimate price of costless gestures: 2020’s 2,000+ excess black lives lost to murder](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-price-of-costless-gestures). I don’t think that we’re going back to the 1970’s, but the trendline does not make me happy either. I’ll be fine. Most people who read this will be fine. It’s the people who are the usual targets of violence and murder who won’t be fine. But no one cares.

I think followers of this blog will enjoy. In the next few weeks I’ll be talking to David Anthony ([The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20)) and [Kristian Kristiansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristian_Kristiansen_(archaeologist))[.](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20)

I’ll say it again, [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20) is an excellent book. Really ages well even 14 years on.

This looks really interesting.

[‘Every Time I’m Calling, Someone Has Died’: The Anguish of India’s Diaspora](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/world/europe/uk-india-diaspora-Covid.html?smid=tw-share). I’m being told there’s no problem in the slums. The reason is that the slums were hit on the “first wave.” Obviously a lot of people died in the slums but were never taken to the hospital. Now that it’s hitting the middle class, there’s a huge concern in the Diaspora.

[The Shape of Ancient Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007704Y80/geneexpressio-20) is \$1.99 again on Kindle. I have no idea what Amazon is doing, but it’s strange that periodically expensive academic books are put on sale on the Kindle. Always great to see, as academic books tend to be \$50-100.
