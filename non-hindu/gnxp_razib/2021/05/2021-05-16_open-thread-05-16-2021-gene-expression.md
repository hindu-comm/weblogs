I’m reviewing [Peace, Poverty and Betrayal: A New History of British India](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1787383857/geneexpressio-20) for [UnHerd](https://unherd.com/). Also, Marie Favereau, author of [The Horde: How the Mongols Changed the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08VF4PJ1M/geneexpressio-20), will be on my [Substack this week. A break from Indo-Europeans.](http://razib.substack.com/)

I periodically guest on [The Study of Antiquity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxRSpkGOH_09pxKvgD8S5jQ) YouTube channel. The episodes are not that long. YouTube channels are not my jam, but the view numbers are incredible, and it’s another way to get the “good news” out.

[Dissecting polygenic signals from genome-wide association studies on human behaviour](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01110-y.epdf?sharing_token=UnRtzvGgfjYCoXOH_NGkWdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PXU6qxgOUDngHJuH2BOINGQFwSop1ncVRSG2KMtYl49PJ8uBIfVnkjvc4upk2qUhAvdm_zy-RTEph0qHjua5pn_YRMBRFQrnCAQbikazwA2BprNIRHStSVPqkIESyI2PU%3D).

[Molecular evolution and the decline of purifying selection with age](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22981-9).

[Continuity of Pagan Religious Traditions in Tenth-Century Iraq](http://melammu-project.eu/pdf/hameen-anttila2002.pdf). So here’s what going on: some of the customs and rites of ancient Mesopotamian religion persisted down to the 900s A.D. The ethnographic reports of the Muslims who observed this indicate that the peasants were forgetting the purpose and intent of the rites, but it is rather clear that what they’re writing about consists of veneration of the Babylonian God Tammuz. Modern scholars have access to cuneiform and so understand the Babylonian religion well enough to validate the Muslim informants’ veracity.

[I’m Angry About Palestine. Should You Be?](https://wisdomofcrowds.live/im-angry-about-palestine-should-you-be/) I said this on Twitter: Shadi is a believer in traditional liberal norms of fair play and engagement. This buys him something: my attention.

**Update:** Since Clubhouse is opening to Android, I should put up a few notices. First, join my club, [Razib Khan’s Unsupervised Learning](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/RazibKhansUnsupervisedLearning). Second, follow me, @[razibkhan](https://joinclubhouse.com/@razibkhan). Finally, my “rooms” are usually on Friday evening (PDT). If you join the club you’ll see the event days ahead of time. I also do impromptu rooms now and then, and if you follow me or join my club you will see notifications when you are online.
