Open Thread – 06/26/2021 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/facingreality.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/facingreality.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08PL6C4RQ/geneexpressio-20)Is it my imagination, or is Charles Murray’s new book, [Facing Reality: Two Truths about Race in America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08PL6C4RQ/geneexpressio-20) getting more traction than his previous book? Probably due to the engagement with the “heterodox academy” types.

I wrote about the [crime spike](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-price-of-costless-gestures) for my Substack in late April, and a lot of people told me that I was pretty bold for having done so. Of course, by mid-May our propaganda media did a heel-turn and decided to start talking about the issue in unison. I can’t express how disgusted I am with American media in 2021. They’re no better than they were during the Iraq War II period. Just new masters.

Unless you’ve been asleep, you know there are new hominins discovered galore. I posted a long (free) [Substack on it and my perspective](https://razib.substack.com/p/here-be-humans). Please share and retweet, etc.

I’ve also been posting on Finnish genetics and culture recently. See [Go west, young Siberian](https://razib.substack.com/p/go-west-young-siberian), and [Weirdness as a national pastime](https://razib.substack.com/p/weirdness-as-a-national-pastime).

For almost 20 years I’ve been taking fire and absorbing hits because I’ll say what I think (to the point of being physically attacked at scientific conferences). A lot of you appreciate it. But in general, you’re cowards and keep your head down.

Sit down and wonder what you’ll tell your kids in the future about the courage you showed, and how you measured up to the values you claim to hold dear. And ask yourself if perhaps the collapse of the world you valued will have had something to do with your craven behavior. You know the answer. Don’t pretend you’re something you aren’t. My kids are starting to be old enough to know who I am. I’m not ashamed. Would you be? If not, perhaps you should be.

My friend [Patrick Wyman](https://patrickwyman.substack.com/) has a new book out, [The Verge: Reformation, Renaissance, and Forty Years that Shook the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08P1MF813/geneexpressio-20). I’ll be having him on my podcast too. Speaking of which, [please add some positive ratings](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/).

Speaking of Patrick, [David Anthony on his podcast](https://podcasts.podinstall.com/wondery-patrick-wyman-tides-history/202106240900-ancient-dna-indo-europeans-and-steppe-interview-professor-da.html). Don’t miss it.
