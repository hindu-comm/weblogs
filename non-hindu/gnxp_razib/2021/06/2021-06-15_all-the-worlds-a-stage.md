All the world’s a stage

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has posted a [reflection](https://www.chimamanda.com/) on her experience with ‘cancel culture’ and young people whom she helped who then turned on her immediately when the mob demanded it. This part is important:

> There are many social-media-savvy people who are choking on sanctimony > and lacking in compassion, who can fluidly pontificate on Twitter > about kindness but are unable to actually show kindness. People whose > social media lives are case studies in emotional aridity. People for > whom friendship, and its expectations of loyalty and compassion and > support, no longer matter. People who claim to love literature – the > messy stories of our humanity – but are also monomaniacally obsessed with whatever is the prevailing ideological orthodoxy. People who demand that you denounce your friends for flimsy reasons in order to remain a member of the chosen puritan class.

I refuse to turn on people and denounce them on demand from the mob. You all know what I’m talking about. Some of my friends have been called on to denounce me, and some have. They are weak. Most people are weak. This period is useful because it will help us separate the true friends from those whose friendship is conditional on the winds of favor.
