2021 Predictions

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1165.jpg?resize=195%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1165.jpg?resize=195%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00RKO6MS8/geneexpressio-20)I figure it can’t hurt to put down a list of predictions just so I can see how wrong I actually was later! So here goes…

– Final USA death toll will be 500,000 from COVID-19. This is close to my original private back-of-the-envelope calculations from February 2020 before I downward estimated because I really hoped the death toll was going to be lower and Americans would change their behavior enough to reduce the R0. I think January and February will be dark months in the US.

– The vaccine rollout in the US will improve and we’ll get back on the originally projected schedule. The initial rollout of vaccines is demonstrating that incentives matter. When money and prestige were put behind vaccine development, the scientific community exceeded all expectations in terms of timeline. A similar dynamic will apply to vaccination velocity. Current projections will be pessimistic, but at some point, shame and embarrassment will motivate the bureaucracies to move much faster.

– 2021 will be a weak year for ancient DNA papers. I hope I’m wrong, but I am hearing that the world-wide shutdown in travel has had some issues on the science pipeline.

– But there will be an uptick in “historical” DNA. That is DNA from historical, not prehistoric eras. Think Roman era or thereabouts.

– Though the Biden-era American elite will be uncomfortable with the trajectory, the decoupling between China and the USA will continue. The dream of globalization as a flat world is over. Topography returns.

– Speaking of China, no one will do much about the Uighurs, though after the coronavirus fades I bet some attention will turn back to that issue. There will be more write-ups in *The New York Times Magazine* and *The Atlantic*.

– Hong Kong is over. It is now Chinese. The rest of the world is going to avert its eyes.

– Political polarization in America will worsen in 2021. The Obama era will seem like an era of “Good Feelings.”

– Digital media will continue to consolidate as more small players fold or are swallowed up.

– Some papers on ancient DNA and Britain will come out. I say this because that’s what I’ve heard from people. High confidence.

– BREXIT reality will be boring. So many exceptions and so much earlier adjustment mean that it’s really more a symbolic thing at this point.

– President Trump will not be a major political force by the end of 2021, but Donald Trump Jr. will be a party kingmaker, and perhaps even signal that he’ll run in 2024.

– Many Mendelian diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis) will be successfully treated with CRISPR and other technologies such as stem cells.

– In 2021r the negative economic impact of having children miss much of 2020 schooling across the world will be discussed and measured/quantified extensively.

– USA will shut down TikTok and Zoom in 2021.

– Differences in short-term economic trajectory between regions and nations will be due straightforwardly to how quickly they can get their populations vaccinated.

– In Georgia’s split decision on the Senate races, Warnock will win and Ossoff will lose. 51 Republicans in the Senate.

– The crime increase in 2020 will be recognized to be due to de-policing, and 2021 will probably see no further increase in crime rates as the Democrats rediscover law & order.

– The Reich lab ancient Middle East paper will finally be published. Basal Eurasians will be identified more concretely (not as in a ‘pure’ individual, but better theoretical understanding of that stream).

– Conferences will be back by the second half of 2021. So I will go to ASHG 2021 in the flesh, and load up on genomics swag (again!).

– The “[Great Awokening](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020)” will not break, and the Biden administration will operationalize “Critical Race Theory” (personnel is policy).

– Modi and Erdogan will deal with massive economic issues but retain popularity (or power) due to their cultural alignment with the mood of their nations.

– Outside of the US, the pivot away from Pax Americana will be palpable as America licks its wounds while the dragon coils around small nation after small nation.

– DNA will prove European [descent from antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_from_antiquity#:~:text=In%20European%20genealogy%2C%20a%20descent,history%20and%20people%20living%20today.&text=Such%20claims%20were%20intended%20as,and%20nobility%20of%20his%20ancestry.).

**Note:** My [predictions for 2012](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2011/12/31/razib-khans-predictions-for-2012/). Quaint.
