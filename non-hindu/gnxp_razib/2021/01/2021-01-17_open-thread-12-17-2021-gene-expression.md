My podcast this week, [American Civil War? Richard Hanania thinks it unlikely](https://razib.substack.com/p/american-civil-war-richard-hanania). Normally for *Unsupervised Learning* I don’t record anything that’s time-sensitive, but obviously, this week required an exception. Also, we talk about the fact that Jon Ossoff follows Scott Alexander on Twitter.

[The World Needs a Real Investigation Into the Origins of Covid-19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-needs-a-real-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19-11610728316). Op-ed written By Alina Chan and Matt Ridley. Here’s my [post with Alina](https://razib.substack.com/p/alina-chan-on-sars-cov-2-and-lab) in case you didn’t see it.

Mike Eisen weighs in:

[Exploring the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2](https://virological.org/t/exploring-the-natural-origins-of-sars-cov-2/595).

[Biden Plans Fewer Rules, More Shots in New Vaccination Drive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/biden-plans-less-rules-more-shots-in-revised-vaccination-effort).

So my [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razib_Khan) page states that I’m “paleoconservative.” The citation goes to 2008, when my friend Reihan Salam termed me a “neo-paleoconservative.” 12.5 years is a long time, and I’m not sure I fit that bill. I’ve moved much further left on economics, and am no longer an immigration skeptic. But, I have become much more ‘socially conservative’ (3 kids will do that, sorry to be cliche).
