Open Thread – 01/03/2021 – Gene Expression

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/religionsuddendecline.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/religionsuddendecline.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08QJFWKD1/geneexpressio-20)A reader alerted me to Ronald F. Inglehart’s [Religion’s Sudden Decline: What’s Causing it, and What Comes Next?](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08QJFWKD1/geneexpressio-20) Inglehart has been involved in the World Values Survey for decades. This book was published in December 2020, and Inglehart notes that it was necessary because a massive wave of secularization has occurred since 2007.

I skimmed a few chapters, and the general thesis of this short work seems to be that the Nordic states are the model for secularization. As people become more economically secure and the welfare state takes the role of civil society, the need for the social functions of religion diminishes.

The main question in 2021 I have is if COVID-19 serves as a natural experiment that drives reaffiliation of people who lose faith in government.
