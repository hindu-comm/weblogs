It looks like the USA has gone through “wave 3”. **But one thing masked in the aggregate data is regional variation.** Whereas major hotspots like California peaked in January, the states in the Upper Midwest peaked around December 1st.

But since then the case-rates have faded, and these states no longer graced the headlines.
