Razib Khan 30x whole-genome sequence data

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/exploringpersonalgenomics.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/exploringpersonalgenomics.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00C7S753I/geneexpressio-20)About [four years ago](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/11/27/razib-khans-raw-genotype-data-on-23andme-family-tree-dna-geno-2-0-and-ancestry/) I posted my [genotype data](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/11/27/razib-khans-raw-genotype-data-on-23andme-family-tree-dna-geno-2-0-and-ancestry/) for anyone who wanted it. This included the raw export files from consumer genomics firms + my VCF file generated by Dante Labs.

Today I will make my **raw data all public** from Dante Labs. This means you can access

– raw reads  
– .bam file  
– .vcf files, as well as files with CNVs and SVs

This is all 30x coverage so be warned these aren’t the smallest files. Here is the [link to my data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zx7l90crbhzh4up/AABjetvJD1LI8nHpnY2EBAy9a?dl=0).

If you find something noteworthy, reach out to me! For those who want geographic provenance, seven of my eight great-grandparents were born in the Comilla region of modern Bangladesh. The eight was born in the Noakhali region, just to the south of Comilla.
