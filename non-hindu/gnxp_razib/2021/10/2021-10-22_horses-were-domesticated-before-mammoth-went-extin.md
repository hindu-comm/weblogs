Horses were domesticated before mammoth went extinct

> Domestication of horses fundamentally transformed long-range mobility > and warfare1. However, modern domesticated breeds do not descend from > the earliest domestic horse lineage associated with archaeological > evidence of bridling, milking and corralling at Botai, Central Asia > around 3500 BC3. Other longstanding candidate regions for horse > domestication, such as Iberia5 and Anatolia6, have also recently been > challenged. Thus, the genetic, geographic and temporal origins of > modern domestic horses have remained unknown. Here we pinpoint the > Western Eurasian steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don region, as > the homeland of modern domestic horses. Furthermore, we map the > population changes accompanying domestication from 273 ancient horse > genomes. This reveals that modern domestic horses ultimately replaced > almost all other local populations as they expanded rapidly across > Eurasia from about 2000 BC, synchronously with equestrian material > culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots. We find that > equestrianism involved strong selection for critical locomotor and > behavioural adaptations at the GSDMC and ZFPM1 genes. Our results > reject the commonly held association7 between horseback riding and the > massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around > 3000 BC8,9 driving the spread of Indo-European languages10. This > contrasts with the scenario in Asia where Indo-Iranian languages, > chariots and horses spread together, following the early second > millennium BC Sintashta culture.

I still think this is a plausible model:

– Horses were used opportunistically on the Eurasian steppe between 3500 BC and 2000 BC

– The horse was fully domesticated 2000 BC with the emergence of the light war-chariot

– The true power of the horse as a military instrument emerged after 1000 BC due to the emergence of mounted cavalry

I can be convinced that the horse wasn’t used opportunistically but it makes the militaristic expansion of Corded Ware so much more plausible to me. We’ll see what David Anthony comes up with in the near future, as he’s on the horse-beat too…
