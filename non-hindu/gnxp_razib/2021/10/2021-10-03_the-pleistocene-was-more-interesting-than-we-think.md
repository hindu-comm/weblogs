The Pleistocene was more interesting than we think

[Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene sites in the montane forests of New Guinea yield early record of cassowary hunting and egg harvesting](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2100117118):

> Eggshell is an understudied archaeological material with potential to > clarify past interactions between humans and birds. We apply an > analytical method to legacy collections of Late Pleistocene to > mid-Holocene cassowary eggshell and demonstrate that early foragers in > the montane rainforests of New Guinea preferentially collected eggs in > late stages of embryonic growth. This finding suggests that foragers > regulated the exploitation of cassowaries and may have hatched eggs to > rear chicks. The montane rainforests of New Guinea may thus present > the earliest known evidence of human management of avian breeding.
