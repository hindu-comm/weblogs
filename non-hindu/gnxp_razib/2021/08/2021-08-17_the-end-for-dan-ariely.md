The end for Dan Ariely

In the late 2000s Dan Ariely was huge. This was the era of the post-2008 financial crisis when heterodox and behavioral economics came into vogue. I really enjoyed reading [Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002C949KE/geneexpressio-20), and Ariely was all over the media for several years. Eventually, the behavioral economics (“nudge”) fad faded, and I didn’t hear much about Ariely.

Unfortunately, it turns out that he is at the center of possible [scientific fraud](http://datacolada.org/98). I stopped paying deep attention to a lot of the sexier behavioral economics because I thought the reproducibility crisis entailed more skepticism, but there might be other reasons.
