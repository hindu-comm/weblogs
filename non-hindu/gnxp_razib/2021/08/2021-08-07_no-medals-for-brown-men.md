> That would be India, fascinating in every regard while also baffling > regarding Olympics. It has the world’s silver medal population tally > (1.339 billion), its gold medal population of exuberance (581 million > people between ages 0 and 24) and chronic trouble getting medals (35 > in its Olympic history, or seven more than Michael Phelps).

> First, the India of yore never much linked sport and nationalism. “The > emphasis was not really on sporting excellence or sporting > nationalism, which happens in a country like China or in a way the > Soviet bloc,” he said (and could have included the United States as > well). He told of an old ethic: “‘The point is to play the sport. The > point is not winning.’” >
> Second, as far as a national project such as China’s Project 119, > well, “India never really had anything like that,” Sen said. >
> Third, the socioeconomic, the “poor health, infrastructure, > nutrition,” Sen said, which mean: “The participation is very low. A > very small amount of the population has the luxury of taking part in > sport.” He said, “There was also, among Indian elites, those who > certainly had access, you might add that is the sort of culture, > parents would emphasize more doing well in academics.” And for the > middle class: “If I want to survive, if you want to have a living, > don’t focus on sports. I think that was, for a long time, part of the > middle-class ethos.” >
> Fourth: “India did not have a sort of winning tradition in one > particular sport,” Sen said, referring to individual sports and > calling to mind the way Australia’s excellence in swimming helps > generate energy toward Australia’s excellence in general. >
> And fifth: “As incubators of sport, India did not have anything like > the university system in the United States.”

(Bangladesh is the most populous country never to medal)
