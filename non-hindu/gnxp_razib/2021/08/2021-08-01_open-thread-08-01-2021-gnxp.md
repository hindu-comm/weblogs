I quite like it. And that’s pretty clear in my review for *National Review*, [Europe on the Verge of a Revolutionary Breakthrough](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/book-review-the-verge-europe-on-the-verge-of-a-revolutionary-breakthrough/). I assume the main gripe someone might have is Patrick is too materialist. But if he covered all the bases the book would get out of control.

I talked to [Patrick for over an hour](https://razib.substack.com/p/patrick-wyman-luther-columbus-and) for my podcast.

I have a review in UnHerd, [Do genes determine intelligence? Both conservatives and liberals are ignoring the realities of biology](https://unherd.com/2021/07/do-genes-determine-intelligence/). I didn’t pick the title. My review is on K. Paige Harden’s book to come out in September, [The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20). On the whole, it’s a worthwhile effort. To be frank I had some pointed critiques that ended up on the cutting room floor (the initial draft was 4,500 words).

Finally, also have a review of Charles Murray’s book in [Quillette](https://quillette.com/2021/07/29/charles-murrays-facing-reality-a-review/). I ended up reviewing the book because *Quillette* had a hard time finding anyone who would be willing to review it.

[Are Syrian Jews Arabs?](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/history/articles/are-syrian-jews-arabs).

[The omnigenic model and polygenic prediction of complex traits](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(21)00271-8).

[Modelling the spatiotemporal spread of beneficial alleles using ancient genomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.21.453231v1.full).

I ask this now and then: can you please review positively my [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/)? (I notice someone negatively reviewed it because I “platformed” Charles Murray)

[The genetic origin of Daunians and the Pan-Mediterranean southern Italian Iron Age context](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.30.454498v1).
