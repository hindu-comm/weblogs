Was H. luzonensis Denisovan?

[Philippine Ayta possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00977-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982221009775%3Fshowall%3Dtrue):

> Multiple lines of evidence show that modern humans interbred with > archaic Denisovans. Here, we report an account of shared demographic > history between Australasians and Denisovans distinctively in Island > Southeast Asia. Our analyses are based on ∼2.3 million genotypes from > 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines, including 25 diverse > self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes > of Australopapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta > Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the > world—∼30%–40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans—consistent > with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. > Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that > there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines > prior to the arrival of modern humans and that these archaic groups > may have been genetically related. Altogether, our findings unveil a > complex intertwined history of modern and archaic humans in the > Asia-Pacific region, where distinct Islander Denisovan populations > differentially admixed with incoming Australasians across multiple > locations and at various points in time.
