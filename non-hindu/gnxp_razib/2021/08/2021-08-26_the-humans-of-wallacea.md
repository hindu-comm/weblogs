The humans of Wallacea

A new open-access paper, [Genome of a middle Holocene hunter-gatherer from Wallacea](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03823-6):

> Much remains unknown about the population history of early modern > humans in southeast Asia, where the archaeological record is sparse > and the tropical climate is inimical to the preservation of ancient > human DNA. So far, only two low-coverage pre-Neolithic human genomes > have been sequenced from this region. Both are from mainland > Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherer sites: Pha Faen in Laos, dated to 7939–7751 > calibrated years before present (yr cal BP; present taken as AD 1950), > and Gua Cha in Malaysia (4.4–4.2 kyr cal BP). Here we report, to our > knowledge, the first ancient human genome from Wallacea, the oceanic > island zone between the Sunda Shelf (comprising mainland southeast > Asia and the continental islands of western Indonesia) and Pleistocene > Sahul (Australia–New Guinea). We extracted DNA from the petrous bone > of a young female **hunter-gatherer buried 7.3–7.2 kyr cal BP at the > limestone cave of Leang Panninge in South Sulawesi**, Indonesia. > Genetic analyses show that this pre-Neolithic forager, who is > associated with the ‘Toalean’ technocomplex shares most genetic drift > and morphological similarities with present-day Papuan and Indigenous > Australian groups, yet represents a previously unknown divergent human > lineage that branched off around the time of the split between these > populations approximately 37,000 years ago. We also describe Denisovan > and deep Asian-related ancestries in the Leang Panninge genome, and > infer their large-scale displacement from the region today.

In particular, the East Asian-related ancestry seems to be basal or deeply diverged from the paleo-Southern East Asian ancestry. There’s a lot in the structure of ancient East Asian populations that I think we’re pretty unclear about, and need more DNA to really understand what’s going on.

But, I do want to mention that in about 24 hours I’ll be posting a discussion I had with Max Larena about the Denisovan admixture in the Phillippines on my [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/). It’ll be ungated in a [few weeks](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/).

Max, and this paper, convince me that Peter Bellwood’s simple model of the spread of farming into Southeast Asia \~4,000 years ago is probably wrong on some level. Too bad, it was a nice simple story. Basically, Northeast Asian populations may have had a presence further south far earlier, and they may have been hunter-gatherers initially.
