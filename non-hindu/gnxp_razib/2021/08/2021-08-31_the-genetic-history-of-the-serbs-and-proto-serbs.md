The genetic history of the Serbs (and proto-Serbs)

[Cosmopolitanism at the Roman Danubian Frontier, Slavic Migrations, and the Genomic Formation of Modern Balkan Peoples](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.458211v1):

> The Roman Empire expanded through the Mediterranean shores and brought > human mobility and cosmopolitanism across this inland sea to an > unprecedented scale. However, if this was also common at the Empire > frontiers remains undetermined. The Balkans and Danube River were of > strategic importance for the Romans acting as an East-West connection > and as a defense line against “barbarian” tribes. We generated > genome-wide data from 70 ancient individuals from present-day Serbia > dated to the first millennium CE; including Viminacium, capital of > Moesia Superior province. Our analyses reveal large scale-movements > from Anatolia during Imperial rule, similar to the pattern observed in > Rome, and cases of individual mobility from as far as East Africa. > Between ca 250-500 CE, we detect gene-flow from Central/Northern > Europe harboring admixtures of Iron Age steppe groups. Tenth-century CE individuals harbored North-Eastern European-related ancestry likely associated to Slavic-speakers, which contributed \>20% of the ancestry of today’s Balkan people.
