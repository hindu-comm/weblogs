The maternal grandmother effect and the rise of patriarchy

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mothersothers.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mothersothers.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0050DIX42/geneexpressio-20)Virpi Lummaa’s group has another paper, [Offspring fertility and grandchild survival enhanced by maternal grandmothers in a pre-industrial human society](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83353-3):

The basic finding is that in Finland **maternal grandmothers increase the fitness of their grandchildren.** This is a big finding in Lummaa’s work but in the discussion this paper notes in other cultures a paternal grandmother effect may be operative. So how general is this result? Do we believe in the maternal grandmother effect?

Also, despite the possibility of a maternal grandmother effect, **societies in the last 5,000 years seem to have shifted to strong patrilocality and patrilineality.** Is this a multi-level selection problem? Basically, inter-group competition between groups hash out so that patrilineality wins on that scale, but within the groups, maternal grandmothers are more important?
