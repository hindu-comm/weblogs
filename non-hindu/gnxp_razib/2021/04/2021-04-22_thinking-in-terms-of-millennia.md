Thinking in terms of millennia

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/panth.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/panth.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074448DHZ/geneexpressio-20)Reading [Pantheon: A New History of Roman Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074448DHZ/geneexpressio-20) has me thinking about the Pantheon. I visited Rome and stood outside (and inside) the Pantheon in 2010. I still remember the feeling of being in such an ancient and pristine building. Itâ€™s pretty awesome. That is, literally awe-inspiring.

How did this building persist? In 609 Emperor Phocas [donated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome#Medieval) it to the Roman Church, which transformed it into a church (it is still used for some religious purposes). This did not prevent total despoilation and parts of the Pantheon were removed or destroyed. But, on the whole co-option by Christianity, a persistent institution, allowed for this monument from deep antiquity to come down to the present in relatively intact form.

I think this gets at something deep in terms of how we can preserve artifacts and ideas long after we are gone.
