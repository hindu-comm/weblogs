Australasian ancestry in Pacific coast Americans?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austmap.jpg?resize=400%2C551&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/austmap.jpg?resize=400%2C551&ssl=1)](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2025739118)About five years ago researchers discovered that there was some affinity between people in the Amazon and populations in Australasia. This was very strange but robust. After that, an ancient sample from Brazil also showed this affinity.

[Now PNAS has a paper with a bigger data set that finds this ancestry more widely in South America:](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2025739118)

The intrapopulation variation makes me suspicious. If it has been tens of thousands of years I would have expected intra-population variation to disappear.

The statistic looks correct. But we still donâ€™t know what that means. The hypothesis presented about a coastal migration seems reasonable enough. But who knows?
