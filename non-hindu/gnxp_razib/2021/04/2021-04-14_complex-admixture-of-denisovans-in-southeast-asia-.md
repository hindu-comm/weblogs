Complex admixture of “Denisovans” in Southeast Asia and Sahul

A new paper, [Genomic insights into population history and biological adaptation in Oceania](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03236-5), is worth reading. Read it along with [Multiple migrations to the Philippines during the last 50,000 years](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/13/e2026132118) and [Multiple Deeply Divergent Denisovan Ancestries in Papuans](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30218-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302181%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

I’m going to sidestep the new inference that Austronesian expansion may predate the movement out of Taiwan. I’ll revisit. Rather, let’s reflect on the Denisovans. **There is strong evidence of more than one admixture from this lineage into modern humans.** And, multiple papers now support a model where various Southeast Asian groups have several different pulses. Finally, the “Denisovans” have really deep divergence. Way deeper than anything in modern humans. Some of them split right after the west-east Eurasian hominin split.

All this is curious in light of small hominins in the Philippines and Flores, as well as late ‘erectus.’ I think it is likely that some of the Denisovan lineages have ‘super-archaic’ admixture, while some of the gene flow is mediated by highly admixed moderns with high Denisovan load.
