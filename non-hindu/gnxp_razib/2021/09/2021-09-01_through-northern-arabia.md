Through northern Arabia

[Multiple hominin dispersals into Southwest Asia over the past 400,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03863-y):

> We have identified at least five pulses of human dispersal into > northern Arabia, each associated with a phase of decreased aridity. > The differences in material culture between these phases—with two phases of Acheulean technology and then three distinct forms of Middle Palaeolithic—suggests that diverse hominin populations, and probably even species, were expanding into the region at different times…

From the [supplements](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03863-y/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3863_MOESM1_ESM.pdf):

> Little is known of the Pleistocene fauna of southern and eastern > Arabia, but the repeatedly distinctive, localised, character of > material culture suggests that crossing the Red Sea at the Bab al > Mandeb was not a primarily dispersal route and that instead > populations filtered through northern Arabia. In northern Arabia the > growing fossil record suggests repeated connections to Africa across a > contiguous grassland zone through the southern Levant which formed > during repeated humid episodes (discussed in SI 10). To that we can > add significant aspects of material culture which we have reported in > this paper. The absence of Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages in northern > Arabia, and the southern Levant, suggests that the Late Acheulean in > this area relates more to Africa than to areas to the north. Likewise, > with the early Middle Palaeolithic at KAM-4 (Assemblage C of the > Northwest Lake) both technological features (such as the methods of > Levallois surface preparation, see SI 7) and quantitative characteristics in terms of PCA of Levallois flake shape situate the assemblage between the Levantine Early Middle Palaeolithic the early Middle Stone Age in East Africa (SI 9)… >
> …The possible MIS 3 presence of Neanderthals in Arabia may suggest > that they expanded further south than previously thought, and highlights that there is currently little clarity on where the main pulse of admixture between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals occurred, beyond probably Southwest Asia broadly. >
> As a closing note, we emphasise that as well as our results being > consistent with repeated pulses of hominin dispersal out of Africa > into Southwest Asia, the possibility of movement in the reverse direction should be kept in mind. Given factors such as current uncertainty on the background to the earliest known Homo sapiens in Africae, and discussions on the possible  
> involvement of a hominin closely related to Homo antecessor as an > ancestor of our species, currently only known from Eurasia, as a precursor to Homo sapiens, building reliable records for the later Quaternary in Southwest Asia is not only important for understanding ‘out of Africa’ dispersals, but also for ‘into Africa’ dispersals.
