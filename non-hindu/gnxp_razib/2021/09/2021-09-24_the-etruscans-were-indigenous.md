The Etruscans were indigenous

[The origin and legacy of the Etruscans through a 2000-year archeogenomic time transect](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7673):

The inference is basically what I concluded and stated this spring in my [piece on ancient Rome](https://razib.substack.com/p/they-came-they-saw-they-left-no-trace):

> By 1000 BC, on the eve of the Iron Age, a mixed ancestry derived from > both Anatolian farmers and Indo-Europeans from the steppe was present > all across continental Italy. Only on isolated islands such as > Sardinia was the situation different, where Anatolian farmer societies > continued unperturbed by Indo-European migrants, giving rise to the > Nuragic civilization, with its massive fortifications. All the length > of the Italian mainland, the ancestors of the Etruscans, Sabines, and > Romans shared roughly the same genetic heritage, despite their > ethno-linguistic differences.

The big novel find is that there is nontrivial Germanic ancestral shift after the fall of Rome. Some commenters have suggested this is actually just from rural Italians, who flooded back into the towns. This could probably be tested.
