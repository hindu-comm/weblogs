The echoes of greater Scythia

I’m reading [The Great Indo-European Horse Sacrifice: 4000 Years of Cosmological Continuity from Sintashta and the Steppe to Scandinavian Skeid](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1435564&dswid=9568), since we now know that modern [horses come from the Sintashta](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2021/09/16/the-heavenly-horses-of-the-sintashta/).

The Indo-European horse sacrifice is a pretty widespread thing. Please note the table above and its shared characteristics. Notice the references to the chariots. Chariots were clearly invented by the Sintashta. And, it seems the horses that could pull them were a special breed, the ancestors of modern domestic horses. **But putatively Indo-European people expanded in Europe long before the emergence of the Sintashta in 2200-2100 BC**. For example, the Bell Beakers show up in Ireland \~2500 BC. Steppe ancestry [shows up \~2300 BC in Greece](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127963/). Therefore, the spread of chariot-culture, and the modern horse lineages, post-date Europe’s original Indo-Europeanization.

I think this indicates that the influence of the Iranian Scythians was felt all over the Indo-European zone…
