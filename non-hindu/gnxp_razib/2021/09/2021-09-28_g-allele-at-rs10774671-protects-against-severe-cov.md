G allele at Rs10774671 protects against severe COVID-19

A new paper digs into OAS1, [A prenylated dsRNA sensor protects against severe COVID-19](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj3624#F2):

> Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but > the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often > unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication > of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the > antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated > gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that OAS1, through RNase L, > potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2. We show that a common splice-acceptor > SNP (Rs10774671) governs whether people express prenylated OAS1 > isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense specific regions of > SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, or only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that > does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, in hospitalized > patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection > from severe COVID-19, suggesting this antiviral defense is a major > component of a protective antiviral response.

You can find the [SNP in you 23andMe raw data](https://you.23andme.com/tools/data/?query=Rs10774671) (unless you are on the recent chip; I looked for a tag variant but found none). If I’m reading the paper correctly, having the AA genotype increases your risk of severe COVID-19 by an odds of 1.58, all things equal. Not crazy bad, but not great either. The haplotype that carries the G allele in non-Africans seems to come from Neanderthals. In Africa, the ancestral G is the majority, though a minority of individuals are A, and that was passed on to Eurasians.

Here is a plot for the 1000 Genomes populations.

**One thing I immediately noticed is that Peruvians have the highest frequency of the A allele in the dataset**. Peru has had the highest COVID-19 death rate in the world, and its frequency of A means that a great number of people will be AA (the frequency of A squared).

I looked in Anders Bergstrom’s HGDP whole-genome data and found an interesting pattern in the frequencies of the G alelle:

|                |          |           |        | |----------------|----------|-----------|--------| | **Population** | **Freq** | **Count** | **2N** | | Karitiana      | 0        | 0         | 22     | | Pima           | 0        | 0         | 26     | | Surui          | 0        | 0         | 16     | | Yakut          | 0        | 0         | 50     | | Maya           | 0.04762  | 2         | 42     | | Oroqen         | 0.1111   | 2         | 18     | | Tujia          | 0.1111   | 2         | 18     | | Peruvian       | 0.1118   | 19        | 170    | | She            | 0.15     | 3         | 20     | | Cambodian      | 0.1667   | 3         | 18     |

Three of the four populations with no copies of the protective G allele are indigenous to the Americas. The Maya, who are known to have European admixture, also have very low frequencies of the G allele. Now, it is true that East Asians also have low frequencies of the G allele (the Yakuts also lack it, so perhaps this was ancestral to Siberians?), but they may have other protective variants (or, suffered through an earlier coronavirus epidemic). I think OAS1 may turn out to be one of the loci that could be associated with a higher risk to severe COVD-19 in the New World.
