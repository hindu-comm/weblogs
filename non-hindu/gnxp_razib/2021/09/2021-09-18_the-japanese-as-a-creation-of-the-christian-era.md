The Japanese as a creation of the Christian Era

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/81RjHTthSGL.jpg?resize=300%2C468&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/81RjHTthSGL.jpg?resize=300%2C468&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005LPUEPK/geneexpressio-20)The traditional model, which I’ve alluded to before on this weblog before, is that Japan is a synthesis of Jomon and Yayoi, with the latter dominant, and bringing rice-agriculture to the islands. A new paper in *Science* indicates it *may* be more complicated than that.

These three ancestral components continue to characterize present-day populations, supporting a tripartite model of Japanese genomic origins.

The [Kofun period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun_period) begins around 300 AD. The implication here is that there was a mass migration from the Asian continent less than 2,000 years ago, likely from Korea. The first agriculturalists, the Yayoi, seem to be a mix of native Jomon and individuals with strong affinities to populations in Manchuria.

Here’s a stylized representation that captures the turnover:

The Jomon are interesting because these results indicate low effective population, and, deep connections with ANE (Ancient North Eurasians). They also seem a clade deep within Northeast Asians, dating to the Pleistocene.

In any case, the authors admit that their sampling of the Yayoi is weak, so there needs to be follow-up here. If it does turn out that the Japanese are mostly Kofun-period, then I think that recalibrates our sense of its history a great deal. The Japan of the 7th century which enters into history was a very young nation.
