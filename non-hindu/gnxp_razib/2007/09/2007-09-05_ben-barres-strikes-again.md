Ben Barres strikes again!

[Michael Bailey](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/08/bailey-article.php) has posted [a response to his critics](http://www.scientificblogging.com/jmichaelbailey/transsexual_smokescreen_ignoring_science_in_the_man_who_would_be_queen). The first comment is from Ben Barres, who readers may remember from the [women in science “controversy” of last year](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/open-letter-to-nature-rejoinder-to.php). The political game Barres is playing should be patently obvious– calling into radio shows to ask pointed, misleading (and well-“framed”) questions is a pretty classic polticial talk show/sports radio show tactic, and it’s utterly pathetic to see it in science. Slightly depressing, even. Based on these two examples, I’m going to extrapolate and say that if you’ve ever got Ben Barres on your side in an argument, you’ve seriously fucked up and need to re-think.
