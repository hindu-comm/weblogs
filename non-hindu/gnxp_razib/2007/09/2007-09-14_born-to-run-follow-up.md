Born to run (follow up)

About a week ago I posted on a [new paper](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng2122.html) about worldwide variation on a gene which results in differences in muscle fiber. The author left a comment, which I’ll reproduce below:

> We thought about selection for cold tolerance, but our latest data on > global distribution of the null allele don’t really fit with that. > Most likely it’s something to do with famine resistance, although > we’re not ruling out the idea that it’s selection for some sort of > muscle performance phenotype (it’s surprising how many muscle genes > are popping up in recent genome-wide scans for selection).  
> We haven’t got genotype distributions for the Kalenjin yet, but we > have a paper due out soon that shows a disappointingly low frequency > of the null allele in Kenyans in general, and no association with > athletic performance in that population. Looks like other genes (and > environmental factors) are responsible for the spectacular endurance > performance of East Africans.
