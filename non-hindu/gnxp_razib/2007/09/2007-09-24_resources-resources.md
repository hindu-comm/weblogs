Resources, resources

A comment below asked about a notation in a particular passage in a book I referenced. As it turns out [the book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231106890/geneexpressio-20) is fully searchable on Amazon. Myself, I do searches on [google books](https://books.google.com/), and if there isn’t a “view” of the book I’m looking for (or that page isn’t viewable), I will check for the book on Amazon. This covers a large proportion of the “fact checking” one might need to do. Also, [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is pretty well integrated with books, so you might just want to start out there. Here are [the libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Book_Search#Library_Participants) who have signed on to google books, so you can imagine that the coverage is pretty good.
