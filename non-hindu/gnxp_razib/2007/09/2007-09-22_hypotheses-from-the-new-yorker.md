Hypotheses from the New Yorker?

In the middle of an otherwise boring New Yorker article about where to buy coats for the coming winter, I came across this passage, describing the author’s (possibly tongue-in-cheek) search to understand why she seems to feel cold more acutely than other people:

> I called Dr. Andrej Romanovsky… to ask how the body detects cold. > According to Romanovsky, the going theory is that a newly discovered > receptor (TRPM8, if you were wondering \[I was!\]) reacts to low > temperatures. This same molecule also reacts to menthol, which > accounts for the compound’s cool feel on the skin. So why is it that > certain people whine more than others when the temperature drops? “I > don’t think anybody studies what you want them to study, ” Romanovsky > told me.

Not true, Dr. Romanovsky! Sometimes people study *exactly* what you want them to study. I googled my way to [this study](http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/8/e40), entitled “Genetic predictors for acute experimental cold and heat pain sensitivity in humans”:

> Background: The genetic contribution to pain sensitivity underlies a > complex composite of parallel pain pathways, multiple mechanisms, and > diverse inter-individual pain experiences and expectations. >
> Methods: Variations for genes encoding receptors related to cold and > heat sensation, such as transient receptor potential A subtype 1 > (TRPA1), M subtype 8 (TRPM8), V subtype 1 (TRPV1), {delta} opioid > receptor subtype 1 (OPRD1), catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), and > fatty acid amide hydrolyase (FAAH), were investigated in four major > ethnic populations. >

Ok, these associations are highly questionable (anyone want to fund a large genome-wide association study of cold tolerance to put the question to rest?), but still, there are scientists asking these sorts of questions.

I also checked out a couple of the genes in [Haplotter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/so-you-want-to-be-population-geneticist.php)— selection for cold tolerance was likely very strong as humans moved north out of Africa. There are some perplexing signals– TRPM8 shows some evidence for selection, but in the Yoruba (Nigeria: probably not exerting a selection pressure for increased cold tolerance). TRPV1 (a receptor involved in heat tolerance) shows a huge signal in the Yoruba as well; this makes more sense.

Nothing too exciting, I just was amused that my furious googling was inspired by an article about coats in the “style issue” of the New Yorker. And contrary to Dr. Romanovsky’s claim, understanding why people feel cold differently is very much an active area of research (and well within the reach of current technology).
