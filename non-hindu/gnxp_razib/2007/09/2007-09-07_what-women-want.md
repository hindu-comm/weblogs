What women want

Published today in PNAS is [a paper](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0705290104v1?etoc) by Peter Todd and colleagues on mate choice in humans. Of course, [everybody](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/09/boys_are_easy.php#commentsArea) [and](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/09/men_prefer_more_attractive_fac.php) [their](http://scienceblogs.com/interactions/2007/09/is_the_result_about_the_subjec.php) [mother](https://anteriorcommissure.blogspot.com/2007/09/men-like-good-looking-women-or-argument.html) [has](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2007/09/researchers_claim_men_like_hot.php) already commented on it, based on a press release, or a Fox News article, or something (science bloggers: disdainful of science press coverage in their own field, yet unthinkingly accepting of it in others?). It’s always interesting, though, when some paper of possibly general interest comes out, to compare the reactions of people familiar with the line of research with those not. In this case, compare the reactions of [Kate at The Anterior Commisure](https://anteriorcommissure.blogspot.com/2007/09/men-like-good-looking-women-or-argument.html) or [the Mungers at Cognitive Daily](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2007/09/men_prefer_more_attractive_fac.php), two blogs which touch on cognitive science and psychology, with the reactions of [Sheril at The Intersection](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/09/boys_are_easy.php) (a marine biologist) or [Rob Knop at Galactic Interactions](http://scienceblogs.com/interactions/2007/09/is_the_result_about_the_subjec.php) (a physicist). The former seem to recognize that they can’t say much without reading the study, and use it as a jumping-off point to talk about the psychology of attraction in general, while the latter seem to have no trouble immediately identifying a fatal flaw in the researchers’ assumptions. Hm. Something to think about (or don’t think about it. If any scientist were to publicly criticize my research methods based on a Fox News article, I’m going to go out on a limb and say I’d be pretty damn pissed).

Anyways, now that the study is out, it turns out everybody was focusing on an entirely peripheral point in the paper. Yes, women are more “choosy” than men, and yes, money and status matter to women, and yes, looks matter to men, but that’s not news. As Jason Malloy [points out](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/09/boys_are_easy.php#comment-558459), if that’s all this paper were to show, it wouldn’t be in PNAS. I’m going to quote him in full (unless he objects):

[Here is](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.essex.ac.uk%2Feconomics%2Fdiscussion-papers%2Fpapers-text%2Fdp620.pdf&ei=6YvgRomDDo-eiwG04ZiFBg&usg=AFQjCNECez-TdRv0jFU1G8F_lgDUb_hChA&sig2=CZJFexyGy0Zw0Ii7WNGM2g) a speed-dating study from last year (PDF): >

> “Women put greater weight on the intelligence \[As measured by SAT score\] and the race of partner, while men respond more to physical attractiveness.”

So this study isn’t breaking any new ground in that regard (which seems to be the one people have focused on). Rather, the part that seemed novel to me (though I think I may have heard of research like this before) was to ask people beforehand what they’re looking for in a partner, then compare that to their actual behavior. It’s actually kind of amusing:

> Table 3 depicts the correlations (separated by sex) between choice > scores and stated preferences. The correlations for women are > generally low for all domains except physical appearance and overall > preferences (i.e., “ideal mate value” compared with “selected mate > value”). Notably, men show a consistently negative relationship > between stated preferences and chosen attributes. These > counterintuitive correlations are significant for physical appearance > and healthiness and marginally significant for overall preferences. > Conversely, the results revealed a positive (although not significant) > correlation between men’s stated attractiveness preferences and the > mean observer-rated attractiveness of their chosen women. As a whole, these findings indicate that **there is a rather poor match between our sample’s verbally stated preferences for mate traits and the preferences they expressed through their actual mate choices**

That is, people essentially lie to themselves (or perhaps only to observers) about what they’re looking for in a partner. Some commenters have fixated on the role of culture in preferences as something not accounted for by this study, but the data seem to suggest that, while it’s not culturally acceptable to say that you’re judging someone by their looks, well, that’s what ends up happening anyways.

Note to commenters: please do not tell me how you met your wife/girlfriend and how your personal experience differs with the conclusions here, or about your successes/failures in online dating. I don’t care.
