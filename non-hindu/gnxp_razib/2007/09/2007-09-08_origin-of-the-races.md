Origin of the races

![raceimages.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/raceimages.jpg?resize=350%2C373)![raceimages.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/raceimages.jpg?resize=350%2C373)Over at [my other blog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/new-races-of-man.php) I have an [exposition](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/new-races-of-man.php) of a set of ideas which have crystallized in my mind in regards to the patterns of human physical variation that we see around us in the world today. A reconsideration of some concepts was triggered in large part by the material I covered in the post about South Asian skin color. Over the next few months I hope to flesh out a precise and clear verbal outline of what I believe to be the general trends in human evolution over the past 50,000 years. In terms of formal/mathematical representations I know of what I speak, but translating the ideas into pithy and compact analogies still escapes me. Usually thatâ€™s a good sign that I need to concentrate harder and obtain a deeper understanding of what the formalisms tell us about biological reality. Stay tuned.
