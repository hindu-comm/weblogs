Blog scholarship

Last year [Shelley Batts](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/) of [Retrospectacle](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/) was the [winner](http://www.collegescholarships.org/blog/2006/11/06/announcing-the-winner-of-the-5000-blogging-scholarship/) of a blog scholarship. This year they’ve increased the top award to \$10,000.
