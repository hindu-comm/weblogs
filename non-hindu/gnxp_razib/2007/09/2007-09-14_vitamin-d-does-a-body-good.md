Vitamin D does a body good

I’ve spoken about Vitamin D a fair amount on this blog before. Not only have I presented it as a major selective pressure for light skin in the northern latitudes **after** the switch to agricultural lifestyles (and the concomitant nutrient deprivations due to reliance on a predominantly starch diet), but I recently found that I myself suffered from a lack. Though I eat a salad most days, and try to eat meats and fish, the fact that I have dark skin and live at a relatively high latitude and in a region characterized by cloudy winters was a combination which naturally led to low levels of synthesis. I’m taking supplements now, and plan on taking them for a long time.  
After I found out about my own deficiency I looked up some side effects. You all know about [Rickets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickets), but it turned out there were a host of global low level ailments that might be correlated with a lack of this nutrient. Now more evidence, [Vitamin D Supplements Appear To Be Associated With Lower Risk Of Death](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070910162408.htm):

Of course, many of the diseases above hit late in life; evolutionarily they might not have been particularly salient (though I doubt that matters to do you if you are 65 and looking at a few extra healthy years). But I suspect that increased morbidity is simply the margin here, it probably has a non-trivial effect on basal physiological fitness.
