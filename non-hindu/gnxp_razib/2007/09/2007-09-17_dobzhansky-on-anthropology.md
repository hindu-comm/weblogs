Dobzhansky on anthropology

John Hawks has a [series of great quotes](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/culture/dobzhansky_1963_problem_human_evolution.html) from a 1963 article by [Dobzhansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky) on the interplay between genetic and cultural evolution. How about this:

> Being an anthropologist only by avocation, I may perhaps venture to > claim for anthropology more than most anthropologists dare claim for > themselves. The ultimate function of anthropology is no less than to > provide the knowledge requisite for the guidance of human evolution

Rather ambitious, no?
