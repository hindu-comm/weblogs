Bryan Caplan critiques Greg Clark

Bryan Caplan has [initiated a series of posts](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/09/malthus_on_stil.html) where he will critique some aspects of [Greg Clark’s](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/08/10-questions-for-greg-clark.php) book [A Farewell to Alms](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691121354/geneexpressio-20/). Caplan [starts](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/09/malthus_on_stil.html) by disputing Clark’s implication that the Four Horsemen can increase per capita income simply by reducing population. I would say he makes some good points, but he does leave an opening:

> …**A plague might do the trick** – it kills some outright, and weakens > the rest. In the long-run, the survivors will have a higher material > level of living. But this hardly makes the plague a “friend of > mankind.” All it means is that after mass death, the frail, disfigured > survivors will get to eat some extra calories beside the graves of > their families. With friends like this, mankind doesn’t need enemies.

The after effects of disease vary quite a bit from pathogen to pathogen and person to person. Additionally, to some extent plague might be a partly exogenous variable, on occasion cutting through populations like a scythe for a few short years and then abating mysteriously for decades. I think this is why the conditions after the Black Death are a good case study which probably leans toward Clark’s contention. 25% of Europe’s population disappeared, but the survivors were not 25% less healthy or productive. In any case, add [Econlog](http://econlog.econlib.org/) to your RSS to keep track of the debate.

Update: Arnold Kling [is feeling Clark](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/09/clark_malthus_a.html) more than Caplan.
