Michael Lynch on non-adaptive evolution

Michael Lynch in *Nature Reviews Genetics*, [The evolution of genetic networks by non-adaptive processes](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/abs/nrg2192.html;jsessionid=97AFA4359AA154139E0199AADEC6E595):

> Although numerous investigators assume that the global features of > genetic networks are moulded by natural selection, there has been no > formal demonstration of the adaptive origin of any genetic network. > This Analysis shows that many of the qualitative features of known > transcriptional networks can arise readily through the non-adaptive > processes of genetic drift, mutation and recombination, raising > questions about whether natural selection is necessary or even > sufficient for the origin of many aspects of gene-network topologies. The widespread reliance on computational procedures that are devoid of population-genetic details to generate hypotheses for the evolution of network configurations seems to be unjustified.

  
A richer exposition of the authorâ€™s ideas can be found in [The Origins of Genome Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934847/geneexpressio-20/). An early paper which shows the seeds of his thinking can be found over at *Genetics*, [Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/151/4/1531) , while [The origins of eukaryotic gene structure](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16280547&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum) is a more recent piece. Both are now open access. Lynch has strong opinions, for example, see this [volley](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/05/neutral-origins-of-complexity.php) launched against Sean Carroll (of evo-devo fame).
