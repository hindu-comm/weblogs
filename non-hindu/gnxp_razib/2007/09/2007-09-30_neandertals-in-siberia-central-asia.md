Neandertals in Siberia & Central Asia

I don’t know if we should believe [Svante Pääbo](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/wall_kim_2007_dna_contamination.html) anymore, but his lab has [some new findings re: Neandertal mtDNA](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature06193.html):

> Morphological traits typical of Neanderthals began to appear in > European hominids at least 400,000 years ago and about 150,000 years > ago in western Asia. After their initial appearance, such traits > increased in frequency and the extent to which they are expressed > until they disappeared shortly after 30,000 years ago. However, > because most fossil hominid remains are fragmentary, it can be > difficult or impossible to determine unambiguously whether a fossil is > of Neanderthal origin. This limits the ability to determine when and > where Neanderthals lived. To determine how far to the east > Neanderthals ranged, we determined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences > from hominid remains found in Uzbekistan and in the Altai region of > southern Siberia. Here we show that the DNA sequences from these > fossils fall within the European Neanderthal mtDNA variation. Thus, > the geographic range of Neanderthals is likely to have extended at > least 2,000 km further to the east than commonly assumed.
