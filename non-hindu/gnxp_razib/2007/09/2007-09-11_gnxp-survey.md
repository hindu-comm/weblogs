GNXP survey

**Note:** For those who need no explanation: [Survey here](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/), enter **55004** in *Take A Survey* box. [Current results here](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?SurveyID=55004).

Every now and then I do a “survey” on this website. Usually we get on the order of 300-500 responses. Generally we don’t learn anything new (i.e., a disproportionate number of the readers tend to be young atheist libertarian males). But I’ve decided to try out a new hosted survey which might give us some correlation structure across the responses. There are 9 questions, and they shouldn’t require much thought. Go [here](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/) and enter survey number **55004** in the *Take A Survey* box. The link should open in a new window/tab, so don’t worry about writing down the number, just look for the box at the right of the screen. You should be able to see the [responses up to the moment](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?SurveyID=55004), but I’ll post the data breakdown across each question next weekend (e.g., atheist conditional upon being a libertarian, etc.). Thanks ahead!
