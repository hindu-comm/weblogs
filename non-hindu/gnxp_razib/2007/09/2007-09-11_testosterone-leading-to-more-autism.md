Testosterone leading to more autism?

[Foetal testosterone linked to autistic traits](http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-3.html):

> This latest update on their progress, presented by Simon Baron-Cohen > and Bonnie Auyeung at the British Association’s Festival of Science in > York today, shows that the correlation between foetal hormone levels > and autistic-trait behaviour continues as the children grow up.  
> …Baby boys produce more testosterone in the womb, **which means they > can also expose a non-identical female twin to higher levels of the > hormone**. But other genetic and environmental factors are thought to > also play a role.

This is of course part of Simon Baron-Cohen’s research program on [empathizers and systemizers](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004009.html)….
