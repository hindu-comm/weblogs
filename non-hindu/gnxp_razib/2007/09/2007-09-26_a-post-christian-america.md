A post-Christian America?

Regular readers know that I often check in on the results from [The Barna Group](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=Home), an evangelical Christian polling outfit. On the one hand I think [The Barna Group](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=Home) tends to be a bit alarmist (they have a very narrow definition for a “Biblically based Christian,” e.g., Catholics don’t count), but on the other hand you can be sure that they aren’t going to be pushing atheist wishful thinking. So I was really interested when I saw that a new study had come out, [A New Generation Expresses its Skepticism and Frustration with Christianity](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=280). In short, the authors find that a growing number of young adults are unaffiliated with Christianity, and many are downright hostile toward the religion. The authors are at pains to point that this is not “just a phase,” a far smaller proportion of Baby Boomers at the same age were religiously skeptical.

  
This chart is particularly illustrative:

The authors of the study paint a picture of a polarized America: **while evangelical churches are marginalizing more liberal and moderate “mainline” Protestant denominations, a larger and larger proportion of the population rejects the central position of Christianity within American culture!** I believe this is simply a lagging indicator of the fact that [Western civilization is no longer fundamentally Christian](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/post-christian-but-not-secular-europe.php) in its self-identification as it has been since the 5th century (when the elite classical pagan tradition disappeared among the ruling class¹). That being said, [neither is it post-supernatural](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/post-christian-europe-part-ii.php), a hostility toward Christianity does not necessarily imply full-throated espousal of scientific materialism. What we have developing is a culture of spiritual pluralism and theological faction. So long as Christianity remains the most powerful organized religious force atheists and non-Christian theists must form an alliance for pragmatic reasons.  
In any case, for me the most interesting point was this:

> **Even among young Christians, many of the negative images generated > significant traction.** Half of young churchgoers said they perceive > Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical, and too political. > One-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality.  
> Interestingly, the study discovered a new image that has steadily > grown in prominence over the last decade. Today, the most common > perception is that present-day Christianity is “anti-homosexual.” > Overall, 91% of young non-Christians and 80% of young churchgoers say > this phrase describes Christianity.

One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians > was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a “bigger sin” > than anything else. **Moreover, they claim that the church has not > helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their > friendships with gays and lesbians.**

Christianity will change on this subject, just as it has (in the generality) changed on divorce, that seems clear. The key is to remain relevant without pandering; often easier said than done.  
1 – Paganism persisted among Neoplatonist intellectuals until the rise of Islam (and via the Sabeans of Haran down to the 10th century), so that is why I specified the *ruling* class. Additionally, I do understand some might object that great European states such as Lithuania remained pagan down to the 14th century. That is a fair point, but I hold that the “West” derives most anciently from the Greco-Roman tradition, non-classical accretions arrived in subsequent centuries.
