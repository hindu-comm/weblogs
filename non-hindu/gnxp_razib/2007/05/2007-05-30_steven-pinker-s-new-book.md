Steven Pinker's new book

Just noticed that Amazon is taking pre-orders for [The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063274/geneexpressio-20/), Steve Pinker’s latest. His [website](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/lectures/index.html) states that Pinker will start his book tour on the publication date listed on Amazon, a little over 3 months from now, so that seems sufficient confirmation. Here is Steven Pinker on [The Stuff of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063274/geneexpressio-20/) from his [10 Questions](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/10-questions-for-steven-pinker.php) last year:

> **(10) Most GNXP readers probably know you for [**The Blank > Slate**](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/geneexpressio-20) > and your work as a public intellectual. However, your next book > (entitled [*The Stuff of > Thought*](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063274/geneexpressio-20/)) > returns to the themes of language and cognitive science. Now, as you > may or may not know, GNXP readers are interested in genetics and evolution; politics, religion, and world affairs; and the past, present, and future of the human species. What can you tell us about your upcoming book that might whet the appetites of GNXP readers?** >
> The subtitle of the book is “Language as a Window Into Human Nature,” > and [*The Stuff of > Thought*](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670063274/geneexpressio-20/) > deals with many aspects of human cognitive and social evolution–how a > mind that evolved to think about rocks and plants and enemies can > invent physics and math and democracy; why people impose taboos on > topics like sex and excretion and the divine; why they threaten and > bribe and seduce in such byzantine ways. I also discuss many > real-world applications of semantics–words that have impeached one > president and that many feel should impeach another; language that > continues to embroil the Middle East; whether Democrats can win back the White House by winning the metaphor wars; whether language traps us in a self-referential circle (as the postmodernists believe) or offers us contact with truth and reality.
