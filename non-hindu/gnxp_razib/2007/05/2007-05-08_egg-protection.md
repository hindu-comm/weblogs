Egg protection

[Evidence of Amino Acid Diversity – Enhancing Selection within Humans and among Primates at the Candidate Sperm-Receptor Gene *PKDREJ*](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/518695&erFrom=-956007347522729436Guest):

To my understanding this sort of barrier between sperm & egg is a variant of [prezygotic isolation](http://www.dwm.ks.edu.tw/bio/activelearner/19/ch19c2.html), a gene flow barrier which crystallizes speciation. If I read their last sentence correctly it seems that the researchers are implying that polymorphism in regards to this character might be a source of reduced fertility between some individuals because of the gametic incompatibilities.

Note: Sperm related genes are always a good target of adaptive evolution because of their proximal relationship to fitness. For example, [Pervasive adaptive evolution in primate seminal proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16170411&amp;amp;amp;query_hl=6&itool=pubmed_docsum).
