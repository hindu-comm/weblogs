Pro forma hand wringing?

The New York Times has a piece which goes over the issue of [genetic testing and abortion](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/weekinreview/13harm.html). Most of the coverage is given over to people who support abortion rights but are not particularly happy about the consequences of the rhetoric of “choice.” I’m not old enough to remember, but does this airing of “concerns” remind anyone of some of the sounds made when “test tube” babies were a big social issue? I suspect that most “progressives” given space in this article would concede the importance of points the disability rights activist person makes. That being said, I also suspect that they won’t do anything about the inevitable shift toward consumer genetics and the selective abortions of fetuses with disabilities.
