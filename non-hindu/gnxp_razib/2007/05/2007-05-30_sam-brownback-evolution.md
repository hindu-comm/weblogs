Sam Brownback & evolution

Sam Brownback offers a [cryptic op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31brownback.html) in regards to his attitude toward evolution (he, one of the three Republican candidates for president who raised their hand when Chris Matthews asked if any of them do not believe in the theory of evolution). As they say, **read the whole thing, Brownback is *definitely* a politician**. He seems to have believed that Chris Matthews asked if any of the candidates rejected scientific materialism. Nary a word about common descent in the op-ed, the typical genuflections toward microevolution, and a peculiar objection to **both** “determinism” and “chance.”
