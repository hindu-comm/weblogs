Grandmother hypothesis article

Here’s [an article](http://www.inklingmagazine.com/articles/the-evoluion-of-grandmothering/) on [The Grandmother Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis). Personally, I didn’t take the idea seriously until a biological anthropologist told me that [menopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause) was a tightly integrated proactive cascade of biochemical changes which shuts down female procreative capacity. In contrast, human males exhibit declining fertility in a gradual fashion due to a generalized breakdown of bodily function. I am generally suspicious of some sort of adaptation when something so precise in our physiology seems on the surface to *reduce* fitness.  
**Update:** Here is [an article](http://www.anthro.utah.edu/faculty/PDFs/Papers/NBJ2002.pdf) from the originator of The Grandmother Hypothesis:

> This article assesses effects of the modern world on hunter-gatherer > adult mortality, with special reference to the Hadza. Evidence > suggests that such effects are not sufficient to deny the existence of > substantial life expectancy at the end of the childbearing career. > Data from contemporary hunter-gatherers(Ache, !Kung, Hadza) match > longevity extrapolated from regressions of lifespan on body and brain > weight. **Twenty or so vigorous years between the end of reproduction > and the onset of significant senescence does require an explanation.**

Note: I expect readers of this weblog to comprehend that small (e.g., less than 1%) selection coefficients over long periods of time are evolutionarily significant.
