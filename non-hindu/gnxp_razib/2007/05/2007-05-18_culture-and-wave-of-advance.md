Culture and wave of advance

[Cultural hitchhiking on the wave of advance of beneficial technologies](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0702469104v1?rss=1):

> …Decoupling of the advantageous trait from other “hitchhiking” traits > depends on its adoption by the preexisting population. Here, we adopt > a similar wave-of-advance model based on food production on a > heterogeneous landscape with multiple populations. Two key results > arise from geographic inhomogeneity: the “subsistence boundary,” land > so poor that the wave of advance is halted, and the temporary > “diffusion boundary” where the wave cannot move into poorer areas > until its gradient becomes sufficiently large. **At diffusion > boundaries, farming technology may pass to indigenous people already > in those poorer lands, allowing their population to grow and resist > encroachment by farmers. Ultimately, this adoption of technology leads to the halt in spread of the hitchhiking trait and establishment of a permanent “cultural boundary” between distinct cultures with equivalent technology.**

Application? Trace the spread of agriculture in Europe and [haplogroup J2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J2_%28Y-DNA%29), and map it onto “diffusion boundaries.”
