Herpes, it does a body good

Check [this paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7142/abs/nature05762.html), which shows a latent herpesvirus infection confers resistance to bacterial infections in a mouse model:

> **All humans become infected with multiple herpesviruses during > childhood. After clearance of acute infection, herpesviruses enter a > dormant state known as latency**. Latency persists for the life of the > host and is presumed to be parasitic, as it leaves the individual at > risk for subsequent viral reactivation and disease1. Here we show that > **herpesvirus latency also confers a surprising benefit to the host**. > Mice latently infected with either murine gammaherpesvirus 68 or > murine cytomegalovirus, which are genetically highly similar to the > human pathogens Epsteinâ€“Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus2, > respectively, are **resistant to infection with the bacterial > pathogens *Listeria monocytogenes* and *Yersinia pestis*** \[the > plague\]. Latency-induced protection is not antigen specific but > involves prolonged production of the antiviral cytokine > interferon-gamma and systemic activation of macrophages. Latency > thereby upregulates the basal activation state of innate immunity > against subsequent infections. We speculate that herpesvirus latency > may also sculpt the immune response to self and environmental antigens > through establishment of a polarized cytokine environment. Thus, > whereas the immune evasion capabilities and lifelong persistence of > herpesviruses are commonly viewed as solely pathogenic, our data > suggest that latency is a symbiotic relationship with immune benefits > for the host.
