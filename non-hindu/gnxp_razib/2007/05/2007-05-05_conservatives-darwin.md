Conservatives & Darwin

*The New York Times* has an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/us/politics/05darwin.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all) up about the recent AEI event (which you can watch online), [Darwinism and Conservatism: Friends or Foes?](http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1482/event_detail.asp). Let me reiterate what I’ve stated before, if you do a head count, “against Darwin or not?,” the 1/3 of Americans who would self-label as “conservative” would mostly be against (see [the opinions of white Evangelicals here](https://pewforum.org/surveys/origins/#3)). That being said, there does exist a “split” among **elite conservatives**. Humans have multiple affiliations and affinities, and Jonah Goldberg’s [embarrassment](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjRhODcyYzE2NGQyZTk1OGMzYTM4MzZkYmRlNTBiOTg=) is comprehensible via his identity as a member of the East Coast Pundit Class. If you weight sentiment about Creationism, assign it a positive or negative value, and sum across all self-identified conservatives, I suspect the value would be much closer to 0 then you would have expected because of the shallowness of negative sentiment and the intensity of feeling from the elites.\*

**Related:** *TNR* surveys [conservative movers and shakers](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w050704&s=adler070705).

\* And of course, no on really knows much about the process of evolution. It’s more a cultural marker.
