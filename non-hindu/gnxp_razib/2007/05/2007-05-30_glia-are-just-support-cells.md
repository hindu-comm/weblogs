Glia are just support cells

People who study glia are getting all excited about the ‘tripartite synapse’ where astrocytes that wrap around the synaptic cleft play an active role in controlling neurotransmission. Well TAKE THAT glia researchers!

I kid. I’m sure glia are more than support cells. They really are more active and reactive than people had given them credit for. Perhaps if they don’t directly affect fast neurotransmission they could modulate glutamate driven synaptic plasticity.
