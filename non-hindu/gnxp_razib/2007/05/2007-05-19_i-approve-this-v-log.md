I approve this v-log

Check out [Julian Sanchez’s v-log](http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2007/05/gop_debate_vlogging_take_2.php). I agree with the general thrust of his critique, but I’m also intrigued by the possibilities of turning v-logs into mini-*Daily Shows* as he does with the video splicing here (I assume he didn’t spend a lot of time on this). I don’t think it is really appropriate for science because it isn’t like scientists normally are talking about their work on TV all the time, but perhaps when it comes to something with stem cell policy and the occasional “panel discussions” you see it might be interesting and funny.
