> More than a century ago, some European Blackbirds gave up the > commuting life. The traditional routine was to nest in northern > forests but head for southern Europe or northern Africa at the first > sign of winter. Then some populations discovered that winter in the > city isn’t half-bad: The microclimate is warm with plenty of tasty > leftovers.
