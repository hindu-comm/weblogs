Coevolution of Male and Female Genital Morphology in Waterfowl

Here is something that caught my eye over at [PLoS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000418):

> Most birds have simple genitalia; males lack external genitalia and > females have simple vaginas. However, male waterfowl have a phallus > whose length (1.5-40 cm) and morphological elaborations vary among > species and are positively correlated with the frequency of forced > extra-pair copulations among waterfowl species. Here we report > morphological complexity in female genital morphology in waterfowl and > describe variation vaginal morphology that is unprecedented in birds. > This variation comprises two anatomical novelties: (i) dead end sacs, > and (ii) clockwise coils. These vaginal structures appear to function > to exclude the intromission of the counter-clockwise spiralling male > phallus without female cooperation. A phylogenetically controlled > comparative analysis of 16 waterfowl species shows that the degree of > vaginal elaboration is positively correlated with phallus length, > demonstrating that female morphological complexity has co-evolved with > male phallus length. Intersexual selection is most likely responsible > for the observed coevolution, although identifying the specific > mechanism is difficult. Our results suggest that females have evolved > a cryptic anatomical mechanism of choice in response to forced > extra-pair copulations.

This paper has some interesting figures.
