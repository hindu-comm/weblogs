Formalization & process

[Rich Lawler](http://www.propithecus-verreauxi.com/) has an insightful comment:

I think the key here is the reference to **evolutionary process**, dynamics which span time and space beyond intuitive conceptualization. Verbal “[lock & key](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Induced_fit_diagram.svg)” models are often sufficient to communicate the biophysical processes at work when an enzyme and substrate interact. A graphical illustration of a biophysical process is clear as the visual mapping is can be precise and accurate; the primary actors here are material. Not so for something as abstract as “fitness.” Verbal descriptions of moments about distributions of abstract concepts are not sufficiently precise to allow for fruitful theoretical inference beyond the most elementary level. Of course, a non-mathematical idea can, and usually does, serve as the seed for future growth of formal theory. But when the subject is by its nature complex formalism is often simplest route.
