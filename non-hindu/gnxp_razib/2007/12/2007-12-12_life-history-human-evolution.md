Life history & human evolution

Two articles in *PNAS* caught my attention, [Rapid dental development in a Middle Paleolithic Belgian Neanderthal](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0707051104v1?rss=1) & [Life history trade-offs explain the evolution of human pygmies](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0708024105v1). Here are the abstracts:

> Recent evidence for developmental differences between modern humans > and Neanderthals remains ambiguous. By measuring tooth formation in > the entire dentition of a juvenile Neanderthal from Scladina, Belgium, > we show that most teeth formed over a shorter time than in modern > humans and that dental initiation and eruption were relatively > advanced. By registering manifestations of stress across the > dentition, we are able to present a precise chronology of Neanderthal > dental development that differs from modern humans. At 8 years of age > at death, this juvenile displays a degree of development comparable > with modern human children who are several years older. We suggest > that age at death in juvenile Neanderthals should not be assessed by > comparison with modern human standards, particularly those derived > from populations of European origin. Moreover, evidence from the Scladina juvenile and other similarly aged hominins suggests that a prolonged childhood and slow life history are unique to *Homo sapiens*.

Human pygmies do not appear to have evolved through positive selection for small stature–this was a by-product of selection for early onset of reproduction.

I assume that the case for life history variation between Neandertals and modern humans is evidence for difference, but Pygmies *might* be different and they’re obviously the same species, right? Paleonthropology has a tendency to “bin” different hominids into isolated types and populations, that’s just what language does, but it seems like we might make some more concession to traits as a continuous variable and focus more on distributions across the genus and within species (or what we define as species).
