Obesity is heritable, not genetic

[Genome Wide Association (GWA) Study for Early Onset Extreme Obesity Supports the Role of Fat Mass and Obesity Associated Gene (FTO) Variants](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001361). Even if this is true, **these correlations between particular alleles and obesity hold for the modern German lifestyle.** I guarantee you that population level diversity in weight correcting for height was sharply attenuated when all Germans were basically farmers and laborers. It seems possible to me that in pre-modern times “obesity alleles” might have been selected for something different in an environment where gaining a lot of weight and becoming subject to higher risk of various chronic diseases was not a plausible outcome. With the change in environment the whole phenotypic landscape shifted as the environment in which the genes expressed was radically altered.  
**Note:** I’m skeptical that obesity alleles mark a much more efficient metabolism. After all, if *LCT* can nearly fix in northern Europe why not genes which allow you to more efficiently convert food into energy would not have been swept to fixation long ago? I suppose this could be balancing selection, but there’s only so much of that a genetic architecture can support.
