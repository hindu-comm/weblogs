Menopause in chimps? Or not?

I’ve blogged about [The Grandmother Hypothesis](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&domains=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp&q=grandmother&btnG=Search&sitesearch=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp). Roughly, the question is why do women go through a “change” which rapidly shifts them from being able to become pregnant, though at sharply reduced rates by the time that menopause occurs, to a state of infertility where they may survive for up to three decades? Some argue that this is a peculiar human adaptation and that our social structures, where grandmothers may gain more in investing in their grandchildren than continuing to produce offspring in terms of long term reproductive fitness, are the cause. In contrast to women for males the pattern is one of gradual and consistent decline as the reproductive system is affected by the global breakdown of function characteristic of senescence. Now some data from chimps, [Menopause in Chimps?](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/1213/2?rss=1):

> At about 35 years of age, fertility steeply decreases in women as > their “pool” of oocytes steadily shrinks. And at an average age of > 51–when women have only about 1000 eggs left–they stop ovulating and > enter menopause, typically living an additional 3 decades.

In other words, in chimpanzees there isn’t a strong asymmetry between the sexes in the trajectory of reproductive decline. The inference is that menopause is a derived character within our lineage since the separation of hominids from chimpanzees \~6 million years ago.
