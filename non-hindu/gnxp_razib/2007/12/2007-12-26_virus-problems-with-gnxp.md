Virus problems with gnxp?

Received this email:

I didn’t have the same problem. I’m in a hurry, but I assume this is a client side issue? There isn’t an SSL certificate for this website.

**Update:** See [this](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/3449575379500787555?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/virus-problems-with-gnxp.php&thetime=12/26/2007%2012:06:00%20PM#1995055).
