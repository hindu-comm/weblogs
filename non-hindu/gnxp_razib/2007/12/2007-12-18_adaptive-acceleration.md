Adaptive acceleration

The acceleration story has finally cooled down a bit judging by my google news feed. That being said, I suggest you check out the comments threads on p-ter’s [two](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/notes-on-evidence-for-acceleration.php) [posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/more-notes-on-acceleration.php), [here](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/raldanash/909120563432009531?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/12/notes-on-evidence-for-acceleration.php) &

[John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/) and some of the other authors of the paper have been participating in the back and forth. The [paper](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0707650104v1) is finally on *PNAS*‘s site (Open Access), with the [supplementary information](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0707650104/DC1/1). It is also important that you read this paper in concert with [Global landscape of recent inferred Darwinian selection for *Homo sapiens*](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/1/135), which has a detailed explication of the methods and more specific data.
