Ancient human population sizes

In light of the recent work on the acceleration of human evolution due to increased population size, this paper in *Genetics*, [Inferring Human Population Sizes, Divergence Times and Rates of Gene Flow From Mitochondrial, X and Y Chromosome Resequencing Data](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/short/177/4/2195?rss=1):

> We estimate parameters of a general isolation-with-migration model > using resequence data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the Y > chromosome, and two loci on the X chromosome in samples of 25-50 > individuals from each of 10 human populations. Application of a > coalescent-based Markov chain Monte Carlo technique allows > simultaneous inference of divergence times, rates of gene flow, as > well as changes in effective population size. **Results from > comparisons between sub-Saharan African and Eurasian populations > estimate that 1500 individuals founded the ancestral Eurasian > population \~40 thousand years ago (KYA). Furthermore, these small > Eurasian founding populations appear to have grown much more > dramatically than either African or Oceanian populations**. Analyses > of sub-Saharan African populations provide little evidence for a > history of population bottlenecks and suggest that they began > diverging from one another upward of 50 KYA. We surmise that ancestral > African populations had already been geographically structured prior > to the founding of ancestral Eurasian populations. African populations > are shown to experience low levels of mitochondrial DNA gene flow, but > high levels of Y chromosome gene flow. In particular, Y chromosome > gene flow appears to be asymmetric, i.e., from the Bantu-speaking > population into other African populations. Conversely, mitochondrial > gene flow is more extensive between non-African populations, but > appears to be absent between European and Asian populations.
