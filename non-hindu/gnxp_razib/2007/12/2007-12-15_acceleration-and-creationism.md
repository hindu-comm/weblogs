Acceleration and Creationism

Here is an [article](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13931.html) suggesting that Creationists should be scared of the accelerated human adaptation paper. At first, I would be skeptical, after all, this is [microevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microevolution), which Creationists ostensibly accept.¹ But the reality is that anti-evolutionary thinking is pretty shallow, most Creationists barely know what they believe aside from the fact that they aren’t “descended from monkeys,” let alone the details of evolution (aside from canned talking points which they parrot with absolutely no understanding, e.g., “The second law of thermodynamics….”). I bring this up because a friend of mine who is an evangelical Christian student at Pepperdine University IMed me to ask about the acceleration paper. To be short about it his mind was blown away and he was really shocked by the implications and possibility that humans are evolving today at such a rapid rate. Though he’s a relatively bright individual he is probably about average in his knowledge of science as far as the typical evangelical goes (he has lately been shifting toward a less literalist interpretation of the Bible). My friend’s reaction suggests to me that though Creationists assert that they accept microevolution the model that they are promoting simply results in the inability of many evangelical Christians to comprehend that organisms change over time due to natural selection in the generality. If more Americans lived on farms and saw animal breeding in their day to day life this might not be an issue, but as it is these sorts of biological details have to be imbibed via books in our urban world. And if you reject the academic authorities, well you might never internalize the reality you never experience….  
1 – I am one who thinks that the distinction between micro and macro evolution is one of semantic convenience and notation for the most part.
