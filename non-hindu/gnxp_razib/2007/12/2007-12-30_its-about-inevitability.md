It’s about inevitability….

[Laelaps](http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2007/12/evolutions_arrow.php) has an excellent post up, [Evolution’s Arrow](http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2007/12/evolutions_arrow.php), which you should read. Set some time aside, it is long. I don’t know enough about paleontology to comment with great insight on the many of the topics which [Laelaps](http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2007/12/evolutions_arrow.php) alludes to, and some of them get a bit philosophical for my own taste (that is, issues turn on the interpretation of words), but there is one point which I might assert is somewhat muddy:

First, regarding the other hominid groups. Certainly some of them had some longevity on their side, but, it is important to note we are considerably more numerous. One could integrate across the time period that these species flourished and sum up total numbers to compare a raw count and use this as an estimator of “success.” But as I said, much hinges on words such as successful. But the second point is that I think there is a strong likelihood that other hominids no longer exist **because we marginalized them (or absorbed them) through direct competition or destruction of their habitat.** Look at what we are doing the other extant [homonoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape). We are co-opting their ecosystems for our own use, and on occasion we even hunt and consume them. It seems likely that they have been saved so far because they tend to inhabit biomes which our species has exploited to a lesser degree until recently. This emphasizes the fact that adaptation and response to other organisms, evolution’s arms race, is a critical parameter which expands the scope of the discussion beyond the interface of the environment and the phenotype of a given species.
