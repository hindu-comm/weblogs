Hypotheses are overrated

So says the [European Journal of Human Genetics](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n1/full/5201970a.html), in response to the flood of data from [genome-wide association studies](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&domains=gnxp.com&q=genome+wide+association+studies&btnG=Search&sitesearch=gnxp.com) and other genomic data in the field of human genetics:

> \[O\]ne might maliciously wonder if we are not (temporarily, in this > field and pending subsequent functional studies) close to the ultimate > consumption date of the Popperian approach of hypothesis-driven > research. For was not a main goal of this to unravel the truth in the > most efficient, that is, plausible way, faced with a daunting scarcity > of collectible data? Well, **if it becomes cheaper to just collect all > data required than to run after a hundred consecutive, plausible, but > wrong hypotheses, starting with a hypothesis becomes an economic > futility**. The hypothesis as a guiding principle is then replaced by > a truism: if one does not throw away anything before thoroughly > assessing its irrelevance, one will always find what one is looking > for.
