Accountability

Some of you may have heard about Eric Altermann’s [altercation with the law](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/eric_alterman_fought_the_law.php#more) (sorry, had to say that!). This is what caught my attention:

> A guy came over and asked me who I was and I told him I was a > colmunist for The Nation and he told me I had to leave. I thought he > was kind of rude, **so I asked him his name, thinking it might go into > Altercation the next day….**

One of the realities of life is having to deal with “officials,” whether it be faceless bureaucrats, customer “service” representatives, or the police. In many situations there is a major power imbalance between said officials and those they are to serve and protect. I haven’t had many dealings with the police in my life, but I am paranoid enough to always been cautious about them because they do have the power of life and death over you (yes, I know the risk of getting “wronged” by the cops is low, but who cares what the probability is once it happens to you!). This is where having a blog is something I’ve considered as being handy. My traffic numbers aren’t that high. Typically I get 500-1000 unique users on this weblog, and sitemeter tells me my other weblog has 4,000 uniques per day (but a lot of these are google image queries). Nevertheless, that’s an non-trivial amount of traffic, and, Google News regular crawls this website. If I was wronged by office Joe Blow, hell yeah I’d get his name, and I would report exactly what happened on my weblog so that when people typed Joe Blow’s name into google the story would come up. **The point is that Authority shouldn’t be faceless or nameless**. Remember what happened to [Shelley](http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/when_fair_use_isnt_fair_1.php)? And remember what happened to the low level editor at Wiley? Now, the threats and abuse she received are not defensible, but frankly who was she to send out a threatening email to a small blogger? **It was the power of a corporation she was wielding, she wasn’t entering into a human-to-human interaction**. Now I assume the editor is far more cautious about assuming that she can throw her weight around just because she works at a large corporation.
