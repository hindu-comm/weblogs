Responses to the undead gods

My piece, Why the gods will not be defeated, has generated [some response](http://technorati.com/search/http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/05/why_the_gods_will_not_be_defea.php) on the internet. [Reihan Salam](http://www.theamericanscene.com/2007/05/ill-informed-thoughts-on-religion-ross.php) & [Ross Douthat](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/06/what_is_secularism.php) both have some thoughts, while fellow *ScienceBlogger* Jonah Leher [offered some kind words](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/06/religion_secularism_and_myster.php). Also, just an FYI, I’ve been asked to turn the post into an extended essay elsewhere. Wait a few weeks for the notification when it goes up. Regular readers won’t find anything new, but it will have all of my baroque ideas cheek by jowl in one sequence of text, we’ll see how it works out….  
**PS:** Some have taken to criticizing the specific numbers in some of the surveys. Sample enough surveys and **you can find almost any number**. The point wasn’t one specific number, but the general picture the data gives us (and the data tends to converge upon some modal values).
