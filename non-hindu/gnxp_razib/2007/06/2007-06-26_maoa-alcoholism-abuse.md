MAOA, alcoholism & abuse

[Gene Variant Increases Risk For Alcoholism Following Childhood Abuse](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070626080543.htm). We’ve been following this story [for years](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=MAOA&btnG=Search+google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) in various forms. Here’s the [article](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/4002034a.html) in Molecular Psychiatry (a Nature journal). From the abstract:

> The MAOA-LPR low activity allele was associated with > alcoholism…particularly antisocial alcoholism…only among sexually > abused subjects. Sexually abused women who were homozygous for the low > activity allele had higher rates of alcoholism and ASPD, and more ASPD > symptoms, than abused women homozygous for the high activity allele. > Heterozygous women displayed an intermediate risk pattern…The MAOA-LPR > low activity allele was found on three different haplotypes. The most > abundant MAOA haplotype containing the MAOA-LPR low activity allele > was found in excess among alcoholics…and antisocial > alcoholics…Finally, a MAOB haplotype, which we termed haplotype C, was > significantly associated with alcoholism…and to a lesser extent with > antisocial alcoholism….
