Ratatouille

![ratz.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/ratz.jpg?resize=252%2C358)![ratz.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/ratz.jpg?resize=252%2C358)Saw [Ratatouille](https://imdb.com/title/tt0382932/) today. Never once checked the time. Very good film. So far Yahoo Movie critics & users give it an A-, and it seems like it’ll win the box office. Much recommended (Pixar animation is the bomb obviously, but the story is really good and could only be told in a non-live action context for obvious reasons). This is a movie whose target audience are children **and** foodies, so definitely a strange and surprising beast. A flavor you won’t forget.
