Writing to Science : Commenting on a blog :: Apple : X?

In Feburary, a little [“Education Forum” article](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/315/5815/1080) in Science analysed quite a bit of data to come to the conclusion that standardized test scores are a good predictor of a number of measures of success in graduate school. Check the article for the actual numbers– there are quite high (\~0.4) correlations between various test scores and things like faculty reviews, publication record, GPA, and graduation. This is wholly unsurprising.

This week’s issue carries a [number of responses](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/316/5832/1694b). One is seriously on par with comments we get on posts about standardized tests on this blog (I don’t mean to offend regular commenters, but that’s not a compliment). And it’s from *a professor at MIT*:

> The Education Forum by N. R. Kuncel and S. A. Hezlett is > **scientifically unsound and socially reprehensible**. The authors, > editors, and approving reviewers must all bear responsibility for > publication of a report that is fundamentally flawed, but that, if > unchallenged, **could set back hard-won progress** toward reducing > unfair discrimination in graduate school admissions by decades. > Members of admissions committees who are prone to unfairly > discriminate against underrepresented graduate school applicants may > use Kuncel and Hezlett’s work to justify excluding students solely on > the basis of the authors’ erroneous assertion that test scores > commonly evaluated for graduate school admission predict future > graduate and postgraduate performance. Kuncel and Hezlett write, > “Accurately predicting which students are best suited for > postbaccalaureate graduate school programs benefits the programs, the > students, and society at large, because it allows education to be > concentrated on those most likely to profit.” Even if standardized > testing could identify students who were “most likely to profit” from > a graduate education, only a crude, backward society would actively > seek to limit opportunity in this manner. However, standardized > testing cannot do this. Kuncel and Hezlett **make the elementary > error** of equating aggregate correlations with predictive power. > Nothing in their analysis permits an admissions committee to look at > an applicant’s test scores and validly predict what that student would > accomplish in the graduate program or their career thereafter. In > fact, even their misrepresented correlation analysis has **obvious > flaws**.

Finally, the misrepresented > correlations are themselves over-stated by the authors. More than half > of the variance in “later performances” cannot be attributed to the > observed variance in standardized test scores.

You can walk through all the internal inconsistencies and irrationalities yourself (or read the response), but it’s a little frightening to think someone wanted to sign their name to this and send it for publication.
