Gould, part deux?

*The New York Times* has a piece, [Darwin Still Rules, but Some Biologists Dream of a Paradigm Shift](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26essay.html?ref=science&pagewanted=print), which alludes to rumblings under the foundations of the [Modern Neo-Darwinian Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis). The standard allusions to evo-devo are in there, but this stuff struck me as kind of bizarre:

> Transitions between species documented by the fossil record seemed to > be abrupt, perhaps too abrupt to be explained by the modern synthesis. > If this were generally true, it could render irrelevant much of > natural selection occurring within species, because just as mutations > are produced randomly with respect to the needs of a species, with > selection shaping these into new adaptations, new species might evolve > randomly with species selection shaping them into evolutionary trends. > This challenge was greeted with less than fulsome praise by > evolutionary biologists studying changes within species. The resulting > hubbub has yet to fully die down. But the newer work cuts closer to > the core of the modern synthesis, and is potentially more > revolutionary, because it addresses the fundamental question of how > really new things happen in the history of life. What brought about > the origin of animals, or the invasion of land?

The bolded part, “perhaps” transforms into talk about species level selection. Frankly that strikes me as a bit much. Additionally, I think the “orthodox” view can handle rapid evolutionary changes followed by periods of stasis. Giving it a new name or added emphasis (“punctuated equilibria”) does not a paradigm shift make. Evolutionary science as crystallized in the 1950s is not a canon. New findings will add nuance and insight to the pervasiveness of constraint & contingency, or the possibility of functional evolution being driven random walk processes. Perhaps you can call that a paradigm shift (i.e., it’s something called science, not the [the quarrel of the ancients and the moderns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarrel_of_the_Ancients_and_the_Moderns)). But the allusive and indirect dance of the prose gets a bit tiresome. Give a paleontologist a pen and watch the erudition bleed out and obscure the potential clarity?

In other news, The New York Times [has a piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26lab.html?ref=science&pagewanted=all) about the study of evolutionary processes via microbial models. The very microevolutionary processes which the above article seems to imply might be a dead end.
