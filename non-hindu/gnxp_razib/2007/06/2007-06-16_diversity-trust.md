Diversity & trust

The New York Times Magazine [has a piece up](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17wwln-idealab-t.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=all) about Robert Putnamâ€™s [work](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/10/diversity_and_t.html) which shows that ethnic & racial diversity decreases trust, not just between groups but between and individual and society as a whole.
