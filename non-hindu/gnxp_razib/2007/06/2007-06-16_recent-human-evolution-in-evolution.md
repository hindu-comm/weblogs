Recent human evolution in Evolution

Evolutionary geneticist Alan Templeton has an article in *Evolution*, [GENETICS AND RECENT HUMAN EVOLUTION](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00164.x):

> Starting with “mitochondrial Eve” in 1987, genetics has played an > increasingly important role in studies of the last two million years > of human evolution. It initially appeared that genetic data resolved > the basic models of recent human evolution in favor of the > “out-of-Africa replacement” hypothesis in which anatomically modern > humans evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago, started to spread > throughout the world about 100,000 years ago, and subsequently drove > to complete genetic extinction (replacement) all other human > populations in Eurasia. Unfortunately, many of the genetic studies on > recent human evolution have suffered from scientific flaws, including > misrepresenting the models of recent human evolution, focusing upon > hypothesis compatibility rather than hypothesis testing, committing > the ecological fallacy, and failing to consider a broader array of > alternative hypotheses. Once these flaws are corrected, there is > actually little genetic support for the out-of-Africa replacement > hypothesis. Indeed, when genetic data are used in a hypothesis-testing > framework, the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis is strongly > rejected. The model of recent human evolution that emerges from a > statistical hypothesis-testing framework does not correspond to any of > the traditional models of human evolution, but it is compatible with > fossil and archaeological data. These studies also reveal that any one > gene or DNA region captures only a small part of human evolutionary history, so multilocus studies are essential. As more and more loci became available, genetics will undoubtedly offer additional insights and resolutions of human evolution.

Here is a [summary](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/03/020307074956.htm) of Templeton’s offering, “Out of Africa again and again.”
