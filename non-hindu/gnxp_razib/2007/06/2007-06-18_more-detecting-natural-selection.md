More detecting natural selection

[A New Approach for Using Genome Scans to Detect Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0050171)

> The evolution of new functions and adaptation to new environments > occurs by positive selection, whereby beneficial mutations increase in > frequency and eventually become fixed in a population. Detecting such > selection in humans is crucial for understanding the importance of > past genetic adaptations and their role in contemporary common > diseases. Methods have already been developed for detecting the > signature of positive selection in large, genome-scale datasets (such > as the â€œHapMapâ€?). Positive selection is expected to more rapidly > increase the frequency of an allele, and hence, the length of the > haplotype (extent of DNA segment) associated with the selected allele, > relative to those that are not under selection. Such methods compare > haplotype lengths within a single population. Here, we introduce a new > method that compares the lengths of haplotypes associated with the > same allele in different populations. We demonstrate that our method > has greater power to detect selective sweeps that are fixed or nearly > so, and we construct a statistical framework that shows that our > method reliably detects positive selection. We applied our method to > the HapMap data and identified approximately 500 candidate regions in the human genome that show a signature of recent positive selection. Further targeted studies of these regions should reveal important genetic adaptations in our past.

I’m in a hurry/busy, so no real comment. It’s PLOS, so it’s free. Read it.
