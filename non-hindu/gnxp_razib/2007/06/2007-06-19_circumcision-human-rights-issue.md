Circumcision – human rights issue?

The post on circumcision certainly got a lot of attention! Google news has been sending me a lot of traffic, so I checked the query out and [found this article](http://edition.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/06/18/circumcision.decline.ap/) which ended thus:

> Ruth Katz, 38, of San Francisco had both her sons circumcised at > brises. She and her husband, Michael Rapaport, were astonished when > the teacher in their birthing class described circumcision as > “immoral” and “not consensual.”  
> “The edict to have your son circumcised was the first covenant with > God — the first challenge to being Jewish,” said Katz, pursuing a > master’s degree in business administration. **“I am a progressive > person and think a lot about human rights issues, but I have never > questioned this.”**

  
Text can’t transmit intonation and tone. Is the lack of questioning a reflective utterance? Or is it defiant? Unlike some atheists I thank god that I don’t believe in god, because the way I live my life is always open to change, challenge and critique. **The *examined* life is the fullest one in my book**. Though custom, tradition and routine do scaffold one’s daily goings on, and to some extent serve to bind us to other humans, I believe it is important on principle to acknowledge that views are as provisional as our lives. I believe that those who sincerely believe in the divine do obtain a certainty in their values, but, I believe the flip side of that is when they must wrestle with the edicts of their god which violate their conscience. The [Binding of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac) is just the most extreme case.
