The unPeople People

Dan Everett, linguist who was the subject of a [profile](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_colapinto) in The New Yorker a month ago, gave a talk to *Edge*, and the [transcript](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/everett07/everett07_index.html) is online (the video is still in progress from what I can see). There is a lot of detail there, and most of it is pretty unbelievable to me. I’ve commented in the past on their supposed immunity to religion. Everett says some more:

> I sat with a Pirahã once and he said, what does your god do? What does > he do? And I said, well, he made the stars, and he made the Earth. And > I asked, what do you say? He said, well, you know, nobody made these > things, they just always were here. They have no concept of God. They > have individual spirits, but they believe that they have seen these > spirits, and they believe they see them regularly. **In fact, when you > look into it, these aren’t sort of half-invisible spirits that they’re > seeing, they just take on the shape of things in the environment**. > They’ll call a jaguar a spirit, or a tree a spirit, depending on the > kinds of properties that it has. “Spirit” doesn’t really mean for them > what it means for us, and everything they say they have to evaluate > empirically. This is what I hadn’t been doing, and this challenged the > faith that I thought I had, to the extent that I realized that it > wasn’t honest for me to continue to claim to believe these things when > I realized how little investigation I had done into the nature of the > things I claimed to believe.

This interests me, because 10 years back there was a book, [Faces in the Clouds](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195098919/geneexpressio-20/), which argued that religion emerges from the anthropomorphizing elements of nature. It seems here that the Pirahã do have the basic building blocks for the generation of a supernatural system, they simply don’t manifest all the necessary preconditions (e.g., engaging in extensive theorizing beyond the first order perception and suspicion).
