Structural variation in humans

Nature Genetics has a [free supplement](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n7s/index.html) on structural variation, with an emphasis on its role in human disease. Nothing too exciting– structural variation is simply a type of polymorphism, albeit with some interesting issues regarding detection, but if you’re looking for some background and discussion of future directions, it might be of interest.
