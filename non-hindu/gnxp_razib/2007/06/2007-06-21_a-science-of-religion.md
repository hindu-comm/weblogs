A science of religion

[U.S. troops form uneasy alliances in Iraq](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-diyala18jun18,1,3288636.story?coll=la-news-a_section):

> Instead, Al Qaeda quickly regained a sanctuary in the province and > imposed its extremist interpretation of Islam. U.S. and Iraqi security > forces scarcely venture into west Baqubah, where smoking is prohibited, as is the sale of women’s clothing by men. **Even placing a cucumber next to a tomato in the markets is forbidden because they have been gendered male and female**.

![haram.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/haram.jpg?resize=211%2C326)![haram.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/06/haram.jpg?resize=211%2C326)Many people think they can introspect their way toward understanding how other human beings model the world around them. That’s a human bias, we have an innate psychology and in many situations it serves us in good stead. But really, I don’t think most Americans can generate a model where they can make explicable laws against placing different vegetables next to each other because the sexes must not mix. I think the “normal” reaction here is to laugh, but these are people who are willing to kill so that cucumbers and tomatoes don’t occupy the same space. Years ago I was talking to a Muslim who was going to convince me that Islam was true, he had definitive proof. You see, there was a tomato that someone had cut open which exhibited the Arabic inscription “Allah.” Q.E.D. Of course I laughed, and the other individual was left to wonder what was wrong with someone would couldn’t see the power of his proof.  
**Note:** Word of advice: turn on safe search if you query google images for “cucumber.”
