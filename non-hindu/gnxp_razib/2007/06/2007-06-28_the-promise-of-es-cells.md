The promise of ES cells

There is a rather salty [piece of correspondence](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n7/full/nn0707-803.html) in the new Nature Neuroscience from one Maureen Condic regarding Nature’s editorial position on the likelihood of development of ES cell-based therapies anytime soon. Apparently, Condic has a skeptical take on the issue and Nature had some disparaging words.

I think it is important to hear about these obstacles and be realistic about what ES cells could provide. There are other uses of ES cells besides implantation type therapy, of course. For instance, they aid the understanding of basic cell differentiation and cell cycle regulation, topics that are important in cancer research.

The problem for me is that I find the ‘moral’ objections ridiculous. So if ES cells have any therapeutic or just plain scientific potential at all, then I’m all for it. Am I living in naive bliss thinking that most average people wouldn’t give a damn after they really understood what a blastocyst is? Right now, I’m thinking that this is one of a few scientific areas where you could educate the public and actually impact policy in a positive way.

There appears to be a semi-lively debate underway over at the [Nature Neuro news blog: Action Potential.](http://blogs.nature.com/nn/actionpotential/2007/04/does_human_embryonic_stem_cell.html)
