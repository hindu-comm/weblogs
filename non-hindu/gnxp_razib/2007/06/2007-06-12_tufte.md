Tufte

Via [ALDaily](http://aldaily.com/) comes this [profile of Edward Tufte](http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=%27Beautiful+Evidence%27+Author+Edward+Tufte+and+the+Triumph+of+Good+Design+--+New+York+Magazine&expire=&urlID=22656706&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Farts%2Fbooks%2Ffeatures%2F33156%2F&partnerID=73272), described in the article as “the world’s only graphic designer with roadies”.

The guy has a huge following in the scientific community–[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) is proudly displayed on many a bookshelf. I’ve only browsed through it, but even that has been enough to make me cringe every time I see the lines and colors of the default Excel graph.
