A universal olfactory aesthetic?

[Predicting Odor Pleasantness from Odorant Structure: Pleasantness as a Reflection of the Physical World](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/37/10015):

They used subjects from a variety of cultures with radically different cuisines. To some extent this should be totally predictable from cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology, but it is nice to be able to fill in a neuromolecular gap. This also puts in perspective the finding that there is variation in olfactory perception. This isnâ€™t an either/or situation, general tendencies are bounded by deviation from the norm, and, the shape of the distribution likely varies by dimension (that is, some smells are likely less constrained by universal preferences and perceptions).
