Evolution of language

*Nature* has two papers on language which I’ll pass along (I don’t know enough about this area to say anything non-tardish) for those who have an interest in such things.  
First, our old friend [Martin Nowak](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&domains=scienceblogs.com/gnxp&sitesearch=scienceblogs.com/gnxp&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=martin+nowak&spell=1) is behind a group which published an article titled [Quantifying the evolutionary dynamics of language](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/abs/nature06137.html):

> …Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the > evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. > We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been > evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to > 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 > remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. > We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of > word usage. **The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square > root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast.** Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.

  
Also, [Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/abs/nature06176.html):

> …Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates > and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship > holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of > the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50% of the > variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. **We propose > that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday > language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of > evolution.** Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.

I hope [Language Hat](http://www.languagehat.com/) or [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/) see this at some point….
