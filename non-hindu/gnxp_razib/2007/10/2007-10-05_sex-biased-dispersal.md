Sex-biased dispersal….

Apropos of my [post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/inferences-about-patrilocality-from.php) about [patrilocality and genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/inferences-about-patrilocality-from.php), here’s an [article](http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/e5m284x76224j287/fulltext.html) (Open Access), [Female-biased dispersal and patrilocal kin groups in a mammal with resource-defence polygyny](http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/e5m284x76224j287/fulltext.html):

Well, humans aren’t bats. That being said, I wonder if **philopatry is critical in inducing males to be “good dads.”** While females have perfect certainty as to who their offspring are, male paternity confidence is [less assured](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/04/paternity-confidence-paper-finally.php). Matrilineal and matrifocal societies seem to be optimal scenarios for males *not* investing in their offspring because of lack of certainty and social supports for males (this is why maternal uncles loom large in many cultures). In contrast, patrilineal and patrifocal societies may serve as watchdogs which guarantee paternity certainty so that males can maximize their fitness by investing in their own offspring. If a man moves to live with his wife’s family it seems likely that if she engaged in infidelity the chances would be far higher than not that her relatives would cover up for her; after all the coefficient of relatedness likely **increases** rather than **decreases** since the lover is likely to be a local.
