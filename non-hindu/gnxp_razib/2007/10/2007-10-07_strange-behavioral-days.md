Strange behavioral days?

You’ll never know what you might find if you go looking….  
So, on my question for skin color genes, [Signatures of Positive Selection in Genes Associated with Human Skin Pigmentation as Revealed from Analyses of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.2006.00341.x?cookieSet=1&journalCode=ahg):

> …We identified eight genes that are associated with the melanin > pathway (*SLC45A2, OCA2, TYRP1, DCT, KITLG, EGFR, **DRD2*** and > *PPARD*) and presented significant differences in genetic variation > between Europeans, Africans and Asians. In six of these genes we > detected, by means of the EHH test, variability patterns that are > compatible with the **hypothesis of local positive selection** in Europeans (*OCA2, TYRP1* and *KITLG*) and in Asians (*OCA2, DCT, KITLG, EGFR* and ***DRD2***), whereas signals were scarce in Africans (*DCT, EGFR* and ***DRD2***).

You might recognize *DRD2*. If not, [let me remind you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor#Dopamine_receptors_in_disease). By coincidence this paper was brought to my attention today….

  
[Polymorphisms in the Dopamine D4 and D2 Receptor Genes and Reproductive and Sexual Behaviors](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP05696715.pdf):

> …Minor alleles of both polymorphisms (7R and A1 respectively) are > believed to decrease the function of their respective receptors. > Individuals with DRD4 7R alleles were more likely to have had sexual > intercourse and to desire children earlier in life. In addition, DRD4 > 7R+ individuals were more likely to report multi-racial ancestries. > Individuals with DRD2 A1 alleles were more likely to not want children > and not want to marry. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the > DRD4 and **DRD2 genes are meaningfully associated with variation in > reproductive and sexual behaviors**. These results are provisionally interpreted as consistent with other findings suggesting that DRD4 7R and DRD2 A1 alleles are adaptive for lower offspring investment strategies in dynamic social environments.
