Interview with Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza in Nature

[The genetic map maker](http://www.nature.com/news/2007/071017/full/news.2007.166.html). Read the whole thing, but this is interesting:

Hm. That’s interesting. In his magisterial [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20) Cavalli-Sforza sketched out the phylogeny of our species. Here he is pointing out that many salient physical features are overlain on top of genealogical substratum. I’ve made [this point](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/new-races-of-man.php) recently myself, but as usual Cavalli-Sforza has anticipated me!  
Here is my [interview](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-luigi-luca-cavalli.php) with Cavalli-Sforza from last year.
