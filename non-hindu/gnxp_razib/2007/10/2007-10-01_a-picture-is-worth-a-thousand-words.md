A picture is worth a thousand words

Below is a graph of the derived allele frequency spectrum in the three HapMap populations (from [here](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n10/abs/ng2116.html)). Many papers have been written about this spectrum, statistics have been derived around it, arguments have gone on about its interpretation, and now…we can simply look at it. Data is a wonderful thing.

ADDENDUM: I should probably give a little explanation of the graph. Razib has added the names to the population labels, and the dotted line gives the expected allele frequency spectrum (given their two-chromosome ascertainment strategy, in case you’re wondering why it’s a straight line and not theta/i) under the assumption of a constant population size. The shift towards rare alleles in the Yoruba indicates a population expansion in recent history, and the shift towards common variants indicates a population bottleneck (or a longer-term small population size) in the European and Asian populations.
