More dopamine (DRD2)

[Genetic triple dissociation reveals multiple roles for dopamine in reinforcement learning](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0706111104v1?rss=1):

> …Here, we show with genetic analyses that three independent > dopaminergic mechanisms contribute to reward and avoidance learning in > humans. A polymorphism in the *DARPP-32* gene, associated with > striatal dopamine function, predicted relatively better probabilistic > reward learning. Conversely, the C957T polymorphism of the *DRD2* > gene, associated with striatal D2 receptor function, predicted the > degree to which participants learned to avoid choices that had been > probabilistically associated with negative outcomes. The Val/Met > polymorphism of the *COMT* gene, associated with prefrontal cortical > dopamine function, predicted participants’ ability to rapidly adapt > behavior on a trial-to-trial basis. These findings support a > neurocomputational dissociation between striatal and prefrontal > dopaminergic mechanisms in reinforcement learning. Computational > maximum likelihood analyses reveal independent gene effects on three > reinforcement learning parameters that can explain the observed > dissociations.
