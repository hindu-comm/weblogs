Why people don't care about statistics

[RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/10/why_dont_most_people_understan.php) points to a [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004992.html) post which discusses and highlights the human ignorance of, and disinterest in, statistical thinking. [Assman](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/10/why_dont_most_people_understan.php#comment-593638) put up an interesting comment. I will say this:

1\) There are some basic tools which many intelligent people are just plain ignorant of. On this weblog one reader, a medical doctor, was surprised by [Bayes’ rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Statement_of_Bayes.27_theorem), but immediately understood its relevance. This happens to all of us, there are amazing tools out there which we haven’t encountered for a variety of reasons. And most of us are happy to pick up the tools if we see clear utility.

2\) But, there’s another problem, and that is the fact that **statistical and probabilistic thinking is a real damper on “intellectual” conversation.** By this, I mean that there are many individuals who wish to make inferences about the world based on data which they observe, or offer up general typologies to frame a subsequent analysis. These individuals tend to be intelligent and have college degrees. Their discussion ranges over topics such as politics, culture and philosophy. But, **introduction of questions about the moments about the distribution, or skepticism as to the representativeness of their sample, and so on**, tends to have a chilling affect on the regular flow of discussion. While the average human being engages mostly in gossip and interpersonal conversation of some sort, the self-consciously intellectual [interject a bit of data and abstraction](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2007/09/social-skills-of-brainiacs-intelligent.html) (usually in the form of jargon or pithy quotations) into the mix. But the raison d’etre of the intellectual discussion is basically signaling and cuing; in other words, social display. No one really cares about the details and attempting to generate a rigorous model is really beside the point. Trying to push the N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see in a college essay format) will only elicit eye-rolling and irritation.

Note: And as Assman noted, the above isn’t really relevant for most people who are probably too light on the g.
