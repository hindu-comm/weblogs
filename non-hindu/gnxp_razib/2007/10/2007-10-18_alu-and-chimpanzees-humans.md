Alu and chimpanzees & humans

[*Alu* Recombination-Mediated Structural Deletions in the Chimpanzee Genome](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030184):

Using a > combination of computational and experimental techniques, we > identified 663 deletions, involving the removal of âˆ¼771 kb of genomic > sequence.

Difference***s***. Sometimes it seems like there a background assumption floating in the air that chimp-human comparisons of any sort (genetic, neurological, etc.) are searching for the magic switch which turns one into a human or a chimp. But of course the difference between a chimpanzee and a human is on the fundamental level **quantitative**, not **qualitative**. And there were millions of years for the two lineages to go their own way.
