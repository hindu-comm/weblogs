Battery not charging….

OK, so the readers of this blog really helped the last time I had a tech issue, it was the Shift key sticking (actually, the problem is the left Shift key, hitting the right Shift key gets me out of the problem every time!). So now I have another issue…my AC adapter for my notebook had problems (the wires were torn up and it was sporadic in generating a current to power up the laptop). I ordered a new one, and it works great. But one problem: now the battery won’t charge. When I plugged in the old adapter the battery did charge (I can get that adapter to work by tweaking with it A LOT), and then the new adapter charged the battery after I swapped it in. But that was a one off. Any thoughts? I doubt there’s a problem with my battery since it happened only today when I got the new adapter. I don’t see anything weird in the Power Options in the Control Panel. Specs below the fold if you are curious for my computer and adapter….

My laptop is a Compaq Presario v5000.

Adapter:  
75W AC Adapter  
Hi Capacity Power Product  
Model: EA10722  
AC Input: 100-240V – 2.0A  
DC Output: 15-24V – 4.3 A

I bought this from an online vendor and this was specifically marketed as compatible with the v5000 Presario.
