Heritability of the Ultimatum Game

Finally, behavioral economics & human variation! [Heritability of ultimatum game responder behavior](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0706642104v1?rss=1):

That means that 40% of the variation in response to the [Ultimatum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game) is due to variation in genes. Yes, I know the [Ultimatum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game) is pretty bizarre. And I know there might be all sorts of complexities. **But it’s a start!**
