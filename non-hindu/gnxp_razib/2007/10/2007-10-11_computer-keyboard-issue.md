Computer keyboard issue

I’m wondering if anyone has the following problem with their computer: sometimes, without warning, my caps lock function flips. Basically if I have it on it goes lower case while if I have it off it goes upper case. Additionally, the period key (“.”) is always stuck as “\>”, and switching case doesn’t help. Links on my browsers always open new windows, and using space to scroll down a page doesn’t work. Finally, I can’t just shut down and restart, I have to switch user in XP and then restart. Does this sound familiar to anyone? It happens at least half a dozen times during the day and it’s starting to drive me crazy to the point that I might get a new laptop (I have a Compaq Presario that I run Windows XP on).
