The New Republic is a Canadian front!

I know that The New Republic was [purchased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic#End_of_Peretz.27s_ownership.2C_2007) by CanWest, but it is funny to see “canada.com” in the title before redirecting to TNR’s [site](http://www.thenewrepublic.com/) (it’s there for half a second). Seems pretty sloppy….
