UK Population Projections

The UK **Office for National Statistics** has just released its population projections for the next 25 years. The central projections are for UK population to rise to 65 million by 2016, and to 71 million by 2031. The ONS is careful to say that these are not forecasts, since the outcome will depend in part on policy decisions and other events which cannot be foreseen. So that’s all right then.

The ONS’s summary statement is [here](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1352). Follow the first ‘Related Link’ to get access to the supporting documents.
