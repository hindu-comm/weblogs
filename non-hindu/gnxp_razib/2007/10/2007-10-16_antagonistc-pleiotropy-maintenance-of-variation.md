Antagonistc pleiotropy & maintenance of variation

[Antagonistic pleiotropic effects reduce the potential adaptive value of the FRIGIDA locus](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0708209104v1?rss=1):

The implication here seems to be that there different genetic architectures which lead to alternative phenotypes which exhibit the same fitness value. This means that the various polymorphisms within the population may lead to multiple adaptive equilibria, maintaining phenotypic variation and the ergo the genetic variation extant within the population. Even though [A. thaliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana) is a plant I think that the basic principles may also operate within our own species and so explain some of the behavioral and physical variation we see all around us. **This should also make us cautious about one-size-fits-all adaptive explanations which ignore why variation would remain within the population.**
