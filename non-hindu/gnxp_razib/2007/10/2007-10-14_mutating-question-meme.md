Mutating question meme

[Sheril](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/) tagged me with a meme of the form:

> There are a set of questions below that are all of the form, “The best \[subgenre\] in \[genre\] is…”. Copy the questions, and before answering them, you may modify them in a limited way, carrying out no more than two of these operations:  
> \* You can leave them exactly as is.  
> \* You can delete any one question.  
> \* You can mutate either the genre, medium, or subgenre of any one > question. For instance, you could change “The best time travel novel in SF/Fantasy is…” to “The best time travel novel in Westerns is…”, or “The best time travel movie in SF/Fantasy is…”, or “The best romance novel in SF/Fantasy is…”.  
> \* You can add a completely new question of your choice to the end of the list, as long as it is still in the form “The best \[subgenre\] in \[genre\] is…”.  
> \* You must have at least one question in your set, or you’ve gone extinct, and you must be able to answer it yourself, or you’re not viable.  
> Then answer your possibly mutant set of questions. Please do include a link back to the blog you got them from, to simplify tracing the ancestry, and include these instructions.  
> Finally, pass it along to any number of your fellow bloggers. > Remember, though, your success as a Darwinian replicator is going to be measured by the propagation of your variants, which is going to be a function of both the interest your well-honed questions generate and the number of successful attempts at reproducing them.
