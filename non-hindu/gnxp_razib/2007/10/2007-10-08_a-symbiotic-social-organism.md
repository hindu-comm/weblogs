A symbiotic social organism?

So here’s Britney Spears escorted by paparazzi while going to get some sushi with her sister. The interesting point is how the **paparazzi are out to protect the Spears**. Why? Obviously Britney is their bread & butter. If, for example, one of them injured Britney so that she couldn’t venture out…I wonder if the others would tear him to pieces?
