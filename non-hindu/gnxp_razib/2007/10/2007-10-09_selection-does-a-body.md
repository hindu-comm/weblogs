Selection does a body

[The genetic architecture of normal variation in human pigmentation: an evolutionary perspective and model](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/suppl_2/R176):

In terms of heuristics which allow us to filter and bias our perception of new data we look to the distribution of facts and processes which we know of prior. For example if I see that a trait is normally distributed and highly heritable I’m assuming that it hasn’t been subject to a long period of strong direction selection, because that tends to eliminate the standing genetic variation necessary for these sorts of phenotypes. So you see two large geographic populations which are fixed for alternative alleles. Selection? Bottlenecks? Hitchhiking?
