Malaria and blood type

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/map_of_O_blood_in_the_world-796798.gif)The ABO blood group was one of the [first genetic markers](http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/414) used in genetic anthropology, and the [worldwide distribution](http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_3.htm) of the various alleles was one of the first known for any locus. It also has a long history in medical genetics as a marker, and there are myriad associations of blood type to [various](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112682018/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0) [diseases](http://www.springerlink.com/content/kg80125321n53037/) (many of these are probably spurious; see the introduction to the second article).

With that in mind, it was interesting to see [this (properly done) study](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0705390104v1?etoc) showing an association between type O blood type and reduced severity of malaria:

> Malaria has been a major selective force on the human population, and > several erythrocyte polymorphisms have evolved that confer resistance > to severe malaria. Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, a parasite > virulence phenotype associated with severe malaria, is reduced in > blood group O erythrocytes compared with groups A, B, and AB, but the > contribution of the ABO blood group system to protection against > severe malaria has received little attention. We hypothesized that > blood group O may confer resistance to severe falciparum malaria > through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. In a matched case-control > study of 567 Malian children, we found that group O was present in > only 21% of severe malaria cases compared with 44-45% of uncomplicated > malaria controls and healthy controlsâ€¦This work provides insights into malaria pathogenesis and suggests that **the selective pressure imposed by malaria may contribute to the variable global distribution of ABO blood groups in the human population.**
