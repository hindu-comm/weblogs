Something’s fishy in the Mesolithic….

[Archaeology: Sharp shift in diet at onset of Neolithic](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6956/abs/425366a.html):

Marine diets are enriched in Vitamin D; some of the Pacific Northwest Indians consumed so much salmon that their children exhibited problems from excessive levels in their tissue! Though some meats, such as liver, as well as milk, also are non-trivial sources they are orders of magnitude less concentrated. There are debates about the usage of isotopes to extrapolate toward diets, but the tendency to rely upon marine sources seems rather common across Mesolithic Europe; with a relatively sharp shift toward domesticate animals and grains with the Neolithic revolution.  
But here’s something else I found, [Cereal Grains: Humanity’s Double-Edged Sword](http://home.brikks.com/xje00/health/ref/cereal_article.pdf):

So what you have here are two synergistic dynamics: the shift away from Vitamin D enriched foods combined with the reliance upon a staple which might actually reduce basal levels of this nutrient! OK, OK, I’m obsessed, right? To some extent yes, but, as with digestion of starch, **I suspect a lot of recent human evolution is diet related**. Because Vitamin D can be synthesized via exposure of skin to radiation the change in this nutrient might be particularly salient, but that does not mean that biochemical tweaks aren’t just as important. In fact, it seems plausible that the variation in adaptations might show up in the range of disease susceptibilities we have as individuals and populations.  
Some of the loci related to skin pigmentation show extremely powerful signatures of selection. This could be [sexual selection](https://evoandproud.blogspot.com/2007/09/when-did-europeans-become-white.html). Or, it could be a byproduct of a nutritional deficiency as well as low sunlight levels. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter that much. We do now though that we’ve probably gotten better at digesting starch and a substantial proportion of the world’s population in western Eurasia can now digest lactose in adulthood because of a recent mutation. How many selective blasts can the genome take? I don’t know, but I think we might have to forget about [Haldane’s Dilemma](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/04/haldanes-dilemma-should-we-worry.php).
