Mutational speed limit?

[Beyond A ‘Speed Limit’ On Mutations, Species Risk Extinction](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071001172753.htm):

This sort of biophysical process seems plausible to me. Natural selection needs some lack of fidelity during replication to have variation to work with, but evolutionary process seems like a moot point if noise overwhelms the informational signal. Here is an interesting “big picture” implication:

> The Shakhnovich speed limit also offers an explanation for observed > differences in genome sizes between organisms with genome error > correction — such as bacteria, mammals, birds, and reptiles — and > those without, such as RNA viruses: In more complex organisms, cells > have evolved correction systems to detect and fix errors in DNA > replication. These systems drastically reduce the number of mutations per replication, increasing the mutational stability of the genome and allowing more intricate and delicate biological systems to develop without the risk of interruptive mutations. >

The paper will be out on *PNAS* this week.
