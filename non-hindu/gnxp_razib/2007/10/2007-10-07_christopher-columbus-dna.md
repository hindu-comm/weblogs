Christopher Columbus’ DNA

Amusing story in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/us/08columbus.html?hp=&pagewanted=all). As I have said, scientific genealogy can answer specific and narrow questions; though in this case I think there’s going to be enough wiggle room for the myth-makers to contine publishing books (note: I don’t know which ones are the mythical ones!).
