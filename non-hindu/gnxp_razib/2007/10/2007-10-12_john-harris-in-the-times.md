John Harris in The Times

The London Times on 10 October had an interesting [profile/interview](http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2622232.ece) with the philosopher John Harris, whose latest book Enhancing Evolution was published recently. As the title suggests, Harris advocates a form of eugenics, among other controversial ideas. I havenâ€™t read the book yet, but it is definitely on my list.
