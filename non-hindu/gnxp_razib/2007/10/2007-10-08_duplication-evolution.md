Duplication evolution

[Ancestral reconstruction of segmental duplications reveals punctuated cores of human genome evolution](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2007.9.html):

This is all great. Why should positive selection be all about [SNPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphism)? And it makes sense that bouts of positive selection wouldn’t be continuous and constant. Consider the expansion of our species out of Africa 100,000-50,000 years B.P., it seems that rapid migration into new ecologies would result in almost immediate pressures toward new adaptations.  
**Related:** SNP, SV, CNV…does the substrate matter?
