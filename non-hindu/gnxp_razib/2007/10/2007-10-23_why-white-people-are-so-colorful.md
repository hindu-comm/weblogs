Why white people are so colorful!

Another day, and another genome-wide association study. [Genetic determinants of hair, eye and skin pigmentation in Europeans](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n12/abs/ng.2007.13.html):

> …We carried out a genome-wide association scan for variants associated > with hair and eye pigmentation, skin sensitivity to sun and freckling > among 2,986 Icelanders. We then tested the most closely associated > SNPs from six regions–four not previously implicated in the normal > variation of human pigmentation–and replicated their association in a > second sample of 2,718 Icelanders and a sample of 1,214 Dutch. **The > SNPs from all six regions met the criteria for genome-wide > significance.** A variant in *SLC24A4* is associated with eye and hair > color, a variant near *KITLG* is associated with hair color, two > coding variants in *TYR* are associated with eye color and freckles, and a variant on 6p25.3 is associated with freckles. The fifth region provided refinements to a previously reported association in *OCA2*, and the sixth encompasses previously described variants in *MC1R*.

  
![angie.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/angie.jpg?resize=261%2C159)![angie.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/angie.jpg?resize=261%2C159)A methodological point which they acknowledge: **their assessments of phenotype were rather subjective and contingent upon self-reporting.** When it comes to eye, and to a lesser extent hair, color think this is not that big of a deal, but I think that there are probably going to be serious issues in subjective self-reporting of skin color in an already fair complected population. I would bet that that is one reason they didn’t find an association with skin color on some of the SNPs.  
They basically confirmed the [*OCA2*](https://www.google.com/search?q=oca2&btnG=Search%21&domains=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp&sitesearch=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp) finding in regards to it being the main determinant of blue vs. brown eyes. Additionally, there are other loci of smaller effect, primarily *TYR*. I was surprised that they noted that several SNPs seem to distinguish more strongly between blue and green eye colors than between either and brown. I now think binning phenotypes into blue vs. non-blue or light vs. dark might miss some serious genetic action.  
While the association of eye color with a few large loci of major effect seems supported by this study, **the results for hair color seem are complicated and equivocal.** Not when it comes to red hair of course, *MC1R* loss-of-function mutations which turn off brown pigment production & up-regulate red-yellow pigment have long been known. But I was more curious about the blonde vs. brown hair color variation. The signals they picked up in this study were numerous and I haven’t really teased them apart in my head yet, but, it seems to highlight why an equivalent of the *OCA2* findings haven’t popped up for explaining the prevalence of blond hair. Just not that simple.  
Finally, another story here is [pleiotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy). The association of the red hair associated SNPs on *MC1R* with freckles, very fair skin and UV sensitivity has long been known, but this paper points to multiple other SNPs which have multi-pronged affects. Interestingly, one SNP, A allele of rs1540771, is reported to be associated with UV skin sensitivity and *brown* hair! This might be a spurious finding, but suggests that a SNP doesn’t have to have the same direction of effect globally in terms of pigmentation (i.e., the implication is that the SNP might increase or maintain hair pigmentation and decrease skin pigmentation). As some of you might know I’m fascinated by the phenomenon of [very dark skinned blondes](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/blondism-in-melanesia.php) in Melanesia; so this sort of genetic process whereby a SNP can have countervailing tendencies in different regions of the body might explain some of that. **In any case, I do suspect that a substantial, though not all, of the eye and hair color variation might have a link to selection for fair skin.**  
**Addendum:** So what’s up with all the moderate minor allele frequencies? If selection is at work how come it hasn’t fixed? A form of [balancing selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_selection)? Or perhaps the [selective sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_sweep) is still running through the population….
