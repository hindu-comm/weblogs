Beggars can't be choosers: sperm competition

Here is an “interesting” paper, [Changes in Sperm Quality and Numbers in Response to Experimental Manipulation of Male Social Status and Female Attractiveness](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/521955&erFrom=-1130868522905948424Guest):

> Here we show in the fowl *Gallus gallus*, where social status > determines copulation success, that dominant males produce more sperm > than subordinates but that the quality of dominant males’ sperm > decreases over successive copulations, whereas that of subordinates > remains constant. Experimentally manipulating male social status > confirmed that ejaculate quality (the number and quality of sperm > produced) was a response to the social environment rather than the > result of intrinsic differences between dominant and subordinate > males. **We further show that dominant males responded to variation in > female sexual ornamentation, which signals reproductive quality, by > adjusting the number and quality of sperm they transferred, whereas > subordinate males did not: they transferred ejaculates of similar > quality to females with different ornament sizes**. These results > indicate that trade-offs between traits influencing reproductive success before and after copulation, combined with variation in social dynamics and female quality, may favor the evolution of phenotypically plastic alternative reproductive strategies.
