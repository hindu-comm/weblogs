Out of Africa model most likely

[Statistical evaluation of alternative models of human evolution](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0708280104v1?rss=1):

I don’t have time to read this paper now, so I hope [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/) blogs it soon. Obviously I’m curious as to how they explain deep lineages, Bruce Lahn’s Neandertal introgression paper attempted to check for dynamics such as balancing selection.
