Note to self: avoid vinclozolin

Speaking of [epigenetics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/epigenetics-in-memory-ii.php), here’s a rather [interesting phenomenon](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/14/5942?etoc):

> Environmental contamination by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) > can have epigenetic effects (by DNA methylation) on the germ line and > promote disease across subsequent generations. In natural populations, > both sexes may encounter affected as well as unaffected individuals > during the breeding season, and any diminution in attractiveness could > compromise reproductive success. Here we examine mate preference in > male and female rats whose progenitors had been treated with the > antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. This effect is sex-specific, and > we demonstrate that **females three generations removed from the > exposure discriminate and prefer males who do not have a history of > exposure**, whereas similarly epigenetically imprinted males do not > exhibit such a preference. The observations suggest that the > consequences of EDCs are not just transgenerational but can be > “transpopulational”, because in many mammalian species, males are the > dispersing sex. This result indicates that epigenetic > transgenerational inheritance of EDC action represents an unappreciated force in sexual selection. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for a role of epigenetics as a determinant factor in evolution.
