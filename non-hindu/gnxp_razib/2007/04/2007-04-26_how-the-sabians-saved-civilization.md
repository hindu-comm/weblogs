How the Sabians saved civilization?

Reading [The Later Roman Empire, 284-602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey](https://www.amazon.com/Later-Roman-Empire-284-602-Administrative/dp/080183354X/ref=sr_1_1/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1177647631&sr=1-1) I stumbled upon this on page 939:

The “Nusairi” refers to the [Alawites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawites), a heterodox marginally Islamic sect whose claim to fame lay in its control of the modern day state of Syria. I had long known of the late paganism of Carrhae. In other cities where paganism was vital and dominated civic life during the 6th century the Byzantine Emperors employed the force of arms to destroy the temples and crush public sponsorship of non-Christian piety (Gaza, Heliopolis, etc.); the religious life of Carrhae was protected in part by its closeness to the Persian Empire. Some of the philosophers scattered after the closing of [the Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy#The_revived_Neoplatonic_Academy_of_Late_Antiquity) eventually settled in Carrhae, which in some ways resembled a time capsule that had preserved the sensibilities of pagan late antiquity, where the astral cults reigned supreme over a latitudinarian religious culture.

In any case, reading up on the [Sabians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabians) I am not convinced of a direct connection between this group and the Alawites. Though we must classify and demarcate religious sentiments as if they stand alone, we intuitively understand that a system of beliefs are affected by the Zeitgeist. Carrhae was dominated by Sabians until [1050](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabians#Sabians_of_Harran), when Muslims took over the city (the Sabians were found in nearby areas for several centuries until the Mongol invasions, their folkways are attested by [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides)). This is approximately the period when many of heterodox Islamic and post-Islamic sects arose, the various Ismaili groups, the [Druze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze) and the Alawites & [Yezidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yezidi). It stands to reason that the Sabians might have influenced the thinking of many of their neighbors because they were a prominent community. Similarly, the Sabians themselves emerged out of the substrate of the northern Levant and upper Mesopotamia, so the similarities between modern groups like the Alawites and the medieval Sabians might simply be due to the fact that they share the same mix of cultural preconditions.1

But my interest in the possibility that the Alawites descend from the last pagan remnants of antiquity in the east disappeared when I read about [Thabit ibn Qurra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabit_ibn_Qurra), the most prominent of the Sabians. He was an “Arab” astronomer and mathematician, and one of the heads of the famous [House of Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom). Some cursory searching on Google Books implies that he was not an anomaly, the Sabians were well represented amongst the translators who mediated aspects of Greek learning and made it accessible to the Arab Islamic world.

Why is this relevant? One of the historical myths of our era is that the Arab Muslim saved the Greek achievement for Western civilization. The argument is that there runs a line of tradition starting during the Greek Classical period down to the modern post-Enlightenment era which was preserved by the efforts of the House of Wisdom. This is false insofar as the Byzantines also transmitted Greek works to the West, and the refugees who washed up on the shores of Italy during the late medieval period as Constantinople fell before the Turks helped spark the Italian Renaissance. But the Byzantine role is not sexy because it doesn’t serve a multicultural narrative (before the contemporary period the emphasis placed upon Islamic civilization’s role in preserving Greek learning was used as a cudgel against Western Christianity). And yet an important fact about the House of Wisdom is that **it was a multicultural affair**, and that during the early phases most of the work was in the hands of multilingual *dhimmis*, who were after all in a position to know Greek and Arabic. Though I had known of the role of [Nestorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorian) Christians, the Sabians’ part was somewhat of a surprise (I was to understand that some of the translators were pagans, but I had not known that that was a synonym for Sabians from Carrhae). Now, unlike Christians or Muslims, I think one might contend that the Sabians of Carrhae had less ambivalence toward the Greek pagan heritage, after all, their culture was a descendant of one that had sheltered the last of the Neo-Platonic philosophers. I am therefore inclined to wonder if the Sabians in particular were a vector for preserving and promoting the rich intellectual tradition which stretched back to the pre-Socratics? I will have to look into this hypothesis (I’m skeptical actually).

On a broader theoretical level I am curious about the role that small cultures like the Sabians play in the dynamics of cultural and civilizational change. Carrhae remained a pagan stronghold because of an accident of geography, its strategic position near the border with Persia and the protection offered by the Shah resulted in the preservations of its peculiar civic paganism in the face of an aggressively Christianizing empire. Though a man of Carrhae could never hope to be great in imperial service without baptism, if one wanted to be a man of standing and influence within one’s own community then pagan profession was necessary so that one could partake of the communal sacraments. The forcible destruction of these sacraments in other pagan cities destabilized this social equilibrium and the result was inevitable Christianization as local elites defected from a religious cult which no longer accrued prestige but was a universal liability.

But though this was the proximate dynamic which led to Carrhae preserving its pagan character, I am offering here the possibility that this might have had a long term ultimate impact of serving as a major conduit for the thought of late antiquity down to the Islamic period. If Carrhae had not preserved its unique culture no doubt the Nestorian scholars of the House of Wisdom would have done their fair bit of translation, but one wonders what the Muslims might have overlooked? This is not to say that Carrhae was a font of rationality and wisdom, many would characterize late Neo-Platonism as a debased supernatural cult with only the faintest philosophical touches. But, just as Hinduism has under its broad umbrella primitive devotionalisms and rarified [Avaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedantic), so late classical paganism spanned the gamut. In contrast, one might contend that the rise of Christianity and Islam resulted in a constraining of the avowed beliefs of the elite, a homogenization of the complexities of the late antique intellectual landscape. During the centuries after the rise of Islam perhaps Carrhae served as a reservoir of intellectual diversity? Do microcultures play the same role within the matrix of other homogenizing macrocultures?

1 – This region was the meeting place of Greek, Arab, non-Arab Semite, Armenian, Persian and Kurd, to name a few. There were also variations within this region, Syria had a far stronger Greek presence than northern Mesopotamia, which had an elite Syraic speaking culture. In any case, the presence of deep rooted Astral cults seems universal. I once read that the Ottoman sultan once made progress through a Kurdish town where the residents worshiped the sun. The sultan was angered by this paganism, and eventually the residents were taken under the wing of the local Jacobite bishop. This is very similar to the story of caliph [Al-Ma’mum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun) forcing the residents of Carrhae to choose a protected religion, so I am not sure if these incidents are necessarily true, as opposed to repeating a common motif.
