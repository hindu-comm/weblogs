Group & kin selection

I promised I’d go over the recent *PNAS* paper, [Group selection and kin selection: Two concepts but one process](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0700662104v1). This is one of those articles where most of the heavy lifting is in the [technical appendix](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0700662104/DC1/1). I’ve decided that it isn’t worth the effort to restate this verbally in detail, I looked over the algebra and I didn’t catch anything glaring (though I could have looked more closely), and would have felt ridiculous pointing out where they used “the [chain rule](http://archives.math.utk.edu/visual.calculus/2/chain_rule.4/index.html) here.” The main point that I gathered from this paper is that Martin Nowak’s model used **groups which did not split very often, but persisted for long periods only subject to *within group* dynamics**. Operationally by the time that splitting did occur Nowak’s groups would be inbred as all the individuals exhibited identity by descent from a common genetic ancestor for the locus in question (which would be fixed).¹ This means that the coefficient of relatedness within these groups is on average about \~1. In other words, the demes that compete within Nowak’s model are actually simply extended families for whom [inclusive fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness) applies as well.  
1 – In small groups most alleles go extinct either through drift or selection over the long term so that one allele at a given generation, t, eventually fixes to 100% at t + n generations. Mutation-selection balance and balancing selection can maintain polymorphism isolated populations.
