The adaptiveness of religion

I have a [long post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/04/levels_of_analysis_of_religion.php) on my other blog about the reality that in I believe religion must be analyzed at different levels of organization. On the one hand, religious beliefs must be “fit” in the context of what representations our minds can accept, find plausible and memorable. But higher up the chain of organization religion can play a utilitarian role in demarcating and differentiating social groups. The relationship between these two levels is fleshed out in more detail in the post. Below the fold I’ve placed a list of my main posts on religion over the past year….
