Day 7 of hot sauce – Mad Dog’s Revenge Habanero & Chile Extract

![mad-dog-s-revenge-large.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/mad-dog-s-revenge-large.jpg?resize=212%2C385)![mad-dog-s-revenge-large.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/04/mad-dog-s-revenge-large.jpg?resize=212%2C385)I’d assumed that [Mad Dog’s Revenge Habanero & Chile Extract](http://www.cosmicchile.com/site/image.html?sku=mad-dog-s-revenge) would be the spiciest “sauce” of the bunch. I put sauce in quotations because it isn’t a hot sauce, it’s a food additive. The label warns not to use this as a hot sauce because it is way too spicy. How spicy? The label says, “1,000,000 Scoville units Mad Dog’s Revenge is 450 times hotter than Tabasco Sauce.” If you don’t know about the [Scoville Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_units), here’s a sample:  
*2,500 – 8,000* Jalapeño Pepper (which I chow down like Bell Peppers)  
*100,000 – 350,000* Habanero Chile  
*2,000,000 – 5,300,000* Standard US Grade pepper spray  
Well, this is “Seven Days of Hot Sauce,” so I decided to put a drop of the stuff into my pasta. It was spicy…but, I wanted just a little more. Unfortunately, I slipped in many, many, drops (I’d already decanted the extract into a hot sauce container). I tried it anyhow. I survived…it was spicy, and I’ve had worse, but it was serious shit. That said, it **tasted like an extract, not a condiment**. My problem cropped up again in that to get the spice that I want, that is sufficient for my palette, it seems that you have to drain a concoction of all its flavor! [Mad Dog’s Revenge Habanero & Chile Extract](http://www.cosmicchile.com/site/image.html?sku=mad-dog-s-revenge) gets a 6 out of 10 because it is spicy, but it used “brute force” methods and lacks any subtlety or texture.
