Chimps more evolved? – part II

*[The Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/news/home/53076/)* has some good quotes in a [article](http://www.the-scientist.com/news/home/53076/) on the [chimp positive selection story](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/chimps-more-evolved.php) from yesterday:

> The screen failed to find evidence for positive selection of two genes > involved in brain development and cognition – > [ASPMM](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=aspm&btnG=Search+google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) > and > [Foxp2](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&domains=gnxp.com&q=foxp2&btnG=Search&sitesearch=gnxp.com) > – that studies have previously identified as positively selected genes > in the human lineage. Zhang and > [Lahn](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/10-questions-for-bruce-lahn_10.php) > agreed that the discrepancy likely results from differences in > [statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power) > between the methods used in the current study and those used in > previous work, which also incorporated polymorphism data.

**Update:** [MIT Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/18544/) has more:

> To Zhang’s surprise and disappointment, the positively selected genes > were not related to brain or cognitive function but to more mundane > cellular housekeeping duties. “One explanation might be that the > number of genes responsible for evolution of the human brain may be > very small,” Zhang speculates.  
> …  
> “It is very rare that there will be enough changes in such a short > lineage to tell us there is positive selection,” says Lahn. “I’m very > surprised that they claim these are positively selected genes. I would > guess if they tried to publish each of these genes as an example of > positive selection, there wouldn’t be enough supporting data for the > majority of them.”
