Just don't use the word 'race'

That seems to be the conclusion of [a recent review](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n4/full/ng0407-437.html) of Nick Wade’s *Before the Dawn* published in *Nature Genetics*:

> My reluctance to recommend the book stems also from Wade’s discussions > of ‘race’ and biology. I agree with Wade that there is something > biological about racial categories. In my opinion, although racial > identity is socially negotiated, people use physical traits as cues > when ‘assigning’ a racial identity to themselves or another > individual.

This is not the argument I expected to follow the sentence “My reluctance to recommend the book stems also from Wade’s discussions of ‘race’ and biology.” In this case, the author isn’t being snide by putting race in quotes, as she really means the word *race* rather than its referent. How often do scholars write that consternation over race is largely related to extra-scientific concerns?

However, I have to criticize this argument, at least to the extent that I’m able to examine the evidence presented. A footnote to the “recent social science research” showing that using the word ‘race’ is harmful (but that cryptic synonyms are OK) would be appreciated, as this forms the basis of the argument against discussing ‘race’. Is it only harmful to discuss ‘race’ and ‘genetics’ or ‘biology’? Is the attribution of racial differences to environmental/cultural causes not similarly harmful? Is it really true, as is implied, that Wade is morally obliged to substitute most instances of “race” in his text with “continent of origin”?

There’s a lot to commend in this review, largely stemming from the reviewers’ honesty and directness, and especially in contrast with [this hatchet job published in the sister journal *Nature*](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/before-dawn-slammed-in-nature.php).

Readers will benefit most by considering each such claim as one among several plausible interpretations of the data.
