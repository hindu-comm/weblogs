Human Brain Evolving

For anyone around Bloomington, there’s a symposium [Human Brain Evolving](http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/5299.html), this Friday and Saturday. You can see the [abstracts online](http://stoneageinstitute.org/PDFs/HumanBrainEvolvingAbstracts.pdf). Looks like Bruce Lahn will be there. If anyone wants to send me a “report” after attending just use the contact drop down to the right and I might post it.
