"High Sensitivity" folk

A few days ago I [blogged](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/evolutions-empire.php) about David S. Wilson’s new book, [Evolution for Everyone](https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Everyone-Darwins-Theory-Change/dp/0385340214/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5521820-4116141?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;amp;qid=1176328399&sr=1-1), without having read it (there was an extract in *The New York Times*). Well, I just read it. As I noted Wilson is a thinker with whom I have strong disagreements, but his interdisciplinary vision results in some good food for thought. Look closely at his bibliographies! I will post a review at my other weblog when I have some distance, but I thought I’d jot down a few thoughts/notes which might be of interest to readers. For example:

They are “stopping to check it out” rather than “forging > ahead.” Given too much sensory input, highly sensitive people tend to > become overwhelmed and withdraw from the situation.

First, it is probably obvious to regular readers that **I am not a highly sensitive person**. Second, I have been guilty of characterizing the highly sensitive as abnormal or pathological. Third, if 15-20% is a good estimate of their population level proportion (at least in the USA) I tend to associate in my own life disproportionately with highly sensitive individuals. I will hazard to guess that this psychological morph is an evolutionarily stable strategy amongst humans in part because of the synergistic possibilities of small groups consisting of personalities of various shades which bring their own special talents and propensities to the table.
