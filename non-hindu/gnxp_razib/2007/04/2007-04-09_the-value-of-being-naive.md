The Value of Being Naive

Go read [Hawks on Nisbet & Mooney](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/framing_laden_mooney_nisbet_2007.html):

This is pretty much right, and I just want to add that this is especially bad advice to give to scientists, because *scientists wouldn’t be scientists if they were really good salespeople*. Spinning is not their comparative advantage, and “fight the enemy on his own turf” is awful tactical advice. Scientists owe whatever respect and deference they’re given to the fact that they’re percieved as being interested primarily in the truth: their reputation for earnestness and lack of guile is a big part of their cred. The best way to get people to regard you as honest is to really be naively honest.

People may be [dumb](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/why-people-believe-in-weird-things.php) in a lot of ways, but they generally know how to spot when someone’s trying to sell them something, and telling scientists that they should behave more like salespeople will result in them being regarded in much the same way—and they are never going to be better salespeople than professional demagogues. I can think of no better way to erode whatever benefit of the doubt that scientists currently enjoy in our culture. If scientists try to play the political game, they’re going to lose. Better to try to stay above the fray than get dragged in and trampled for sure.
