Gayrabia – full article

You can read [full article](http://shezan.livejournal.com/154805.html) about being gay in Saudi Arabia [here](http://shezan.livejournal.com/154805.html) (thanks to Diana). This was the funniest part:

I am struck that the author of the article notes a shortage of “bottoms” in Saudi Arabia. The main reason from the evidence presented within seems to be the preponderance of facultative homosexual behavior among straight males who don’t have sexual outlets (e.g., not married, or their wife is not available). In contrast, I am to understand that in the US gay **culture** there is a shortage of “tops” and “straight acting men.” In a way it seems that Saudi Arabia (and other such cultures, of which there are many, if not to the same extent) presents an opportunity for the obligate homosexual.
