Macaque genome

No time to comment extensively, but I thought Iâ€™d point out [this collection](http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/macaque/) of (open access) papers associated with the publication of a draft version of the rhesus macque genome. Of partcular interest is [this paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/316/5822/235) on human-specific changes in genomic structure:

> Knowledge of the rhesus macaque genome sequence enables reconstruction > of the ancestral state of the human genome before the divergence of > chimpanzees. However, the draft quality of nonhuman primate genome > assemblies challenges the ability of current methods to detect > insertions, deletions, and copy-number variations between humans, > chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques and hinders the identification of > evolutionary changes between these species. Because of the abundance > of segmental duplications, genome comparisons require the integration > of genomic assemblies and data from large-insert clones, linkage maps, > and radiation hybrid maps. With genomic triangulation, an integrative > method that reconstructs ancestral states and the structural evolution > of genomes, we identified 130 human-specific breakpoints in genome > structure due to rearrangements at an intermediate scale (10 kilobases > to 4 megabases), including 64 insertions affecting 58 genes. > **Comparison with a human structural polymorphism database indicates > that many of the rearrangements are polymorphic.**
