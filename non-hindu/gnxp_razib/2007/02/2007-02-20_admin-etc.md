Admin, etc.

I’ve received a half dozen complaints about the slowness of the site due to the technorati widget, so I’ve removed it for now. I see an improvement in load time. Yay or nay?

Also, to the right you should see an [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeneExpression) logo from feedburner. I’ve always had a feed, with a small link provided, but I figured that regular readers should really be encouraged to use this. Of course, the RSS won’t tell you which comment threads are hopping, but in terms of maximizing time utilization I think it’s a good move. You can always bookmark the Haloscan thread of interest (speaking of which, anyone know a better offsite comment service? I don’t like onsite comments because they are liable to take a site down because of repeated hits).

Finally, for those of you down with RSS, I highly recommend adding a few Google News queries to your feeds. For instance, I have [genetics & evolution](https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=genetics+evolution&btnG=Search+News) always updating in Google Reader (which has some downsides, but I like the total integration with my google home page). You can see the RSS links to the bottom left. The [PLOS](http://www.plos.org/) network also has an [excellent set of feeds](http://www.plos.org/connect.html) (page down) so you don’t need to keep checking on their site for new articles (other journals have them too, but I don’t find them as user friendly or value added).
