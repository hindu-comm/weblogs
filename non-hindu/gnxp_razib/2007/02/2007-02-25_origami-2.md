Origami

ALDaily points to this [excellent article](http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/070219fa_fact_orlean) on the world’s top origami artists. This guy has a hell of a bio:

> Lang kept folding while earning a master’s in electrical engineering > at Stanford and a Ph.D. in applied physics at Caltech. As he worked on > his dissertation—“Semiconductor Lasers: New Geometries and Spectral > Properties”—he designed an origami hermit crab, a mouse in a > mousetrap, an ant, a skunk, and more than fifty other pieces. They > were dense and crisp and precise but also full of character: his mouse > conveys something fundamentally mouse-ish, his ant has an essential > ant-ness. His insects were especially beautiful. While in Germany for > postdoctoral work, he and Diane were taken with Black Forest cuckoo > clocks; the carved casings, pinecone-shaped weights, pendulums, and > pop-out birds wouldn’t seem to be a natural for origami, but Lang > thought otherwise. He started a job at NASA’s Jet Propulsion > Laboratory, in Pasadena, in 1988, shortly after he had finished > folding a life-sized cuckoo clock. It had taken him three months to > design, and six hours to fold, and it made Lang a sensation in the > origami world.
