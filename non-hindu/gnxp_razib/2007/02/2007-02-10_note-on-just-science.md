Note on Just Science

I hope you’ve been checking out the [Just Science](http://www.justscience.net/) site this week. If you haven’t, I recommend the RSS feed, <http://www.justscience.net/?feed=rss2> for ease of browsing. In any case, I just want to announce that I’m shutting down the feeds Sunday night at 9 PM PDT. The site will then be frozen in that form until next year, when we’ll do this again. Thanks to everyone who participated, and I hope you’ve been enjoying the posts. If you haven’t had time to check everything out, you know where to go for the next year to browse them. Below the fold I’ve placed the URLs for all the participating blogs if you are in the skimming mood.
