The Galton Institute

Readers may like to know that the **Galton Institute** in London now has a much improved website, accessible [here](http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/).

The Galton Institute was originally founded in 1907 as the Eugenics Education Society, with Francis Galton as its first President. In its present form it does not explicitly promote eugenics, but it encourages research and discussion of a wide range of issues in human genetics and medicine. Membership is open, for a modest fee, to all who support the aims of the Institute. The benefits of membership include a newsletter, a free copy of the proceedings of the annual conference, invitations to lectures and conferences, etc. Back numbers of many of the newsletters are available from the website.

The Institute and its website should not confused with [galton.org](http://galton.org/), which is concerned primarily with the work of Francis Galton himself and provides free downloads of most of Galton’s works.
