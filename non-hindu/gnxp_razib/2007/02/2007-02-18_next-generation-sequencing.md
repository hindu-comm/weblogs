Next-generation sequencing

Nature Biotechnology has a [little news article](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n2/abs/nbt0207-149.html) profiling some of the companies driving the cost of sequencing down. There’s ambition in spades:

> Companies have also started to win bids under the NHGRI \$1,000 genome > program. Unlike the \$100,000 technologies, which focus on refining > and improving existing methods, the conception of a \$1,000 genome > requires an entirely different paradigm-a discontinuous innovation. > Helicos’ technology, unlike the cluster-based approaches of 454, > Agencourt and Solexa, could provide such a leap: in the first commercial award under the \$1,000 program, it received, in October 2006, a \$2 million grant to further develop its single-molecule approach. >
> According to Steve Lombardi, senior vice president of Marketing at > Helicos, “If you had perfect chemistry, and each step was 99.99%, the > instrument would generate 100 billion bases a day. The instrument is > being designed for that throughput, but **the first-generation chemistry will have a smaller yield-around 600 megabases per day.**” Improvements in chemistry could move Helicos to the \$1,000 genome “in the first few years,” he claims-well ahead of the NHGRI goal of 2014.

Everyone talks about personalized medicine and whatnot, but my first reaction is: wow, are microarrays already almost obsolete? With 600 megabases per day (the human genome is 3300 megabases), [SAGE](http://www.sagenet.org/) on a huge scale is possible…
