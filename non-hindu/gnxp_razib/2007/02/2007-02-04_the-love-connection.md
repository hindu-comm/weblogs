The love connection

The explosion of online dating sites, some of which are free and require no registration, has been a boon for psychologists studying the deception and mind games of the dating scene. Scientific American has [an article](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa017&articleID=79C583A1-E7F2-99DF-3BE62D88C9C352E0&pageNumber=1&catID=9) on what they’re finding– nothing that will really surprise GNXP readers:

> For men, the major areas of deception are educational level, income, height, age and marital status; at least 13 percent of online male suitors are thought to be married. For women, the major areas of deception are weight, physical appearance and age.  
> …

We speculated that > from age 29 on–the point at which people in our culture tend to become > sensitive about growing older–we might see some distinctive patterns > in the distribution of ages. For men, a small spike appeared in the Â­distribution at 32 and a large one at 36. The number of men calling themselves 36 was dramatically higher than the average frequency of men between the ages of 37 and 41. >

Apparently women at certain ages are reluctant to reveal those ages–and certain numerical ages are especially appealing, presumably because our culture attaches less stigma to those ages.

That women find socioeconomic status attractive is unsurprising; in my experience, though, there are even more subtle things that affect interest levels. For example, telling someone I’m a “geneticist” always gets a better reaction than saying I’m a “biologist” (people who know me are laughing, because they know neither is technically true. Whatever). I’ve never really understood this– does genetics sound more impressive than biology?
