Bad for boys and good for girls

The two genes MAO-A and 5-HTT have drastically different effects on male and female behavior, according to Swedish researchers at Uppsala University. Major Swedish daily [“Svenska Dagbladet” reports](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_14584170.asp):

> Gene variants that in a given environment lead to alcoholism, depression or antisocial behavior in boys have the opposite impact on girls. And vice versa.

In the study, 5000 swedish youths completed a behavioral survey. From this sample, 200 youths were selected for further interviews and blood tests. Teachers and parents were also interviewed. According to SvD:

> The results were clear. A short version of the gene MAO-A for boys and > a long variant for women in combination with a problematic social environment meant for example an increased risk for alcohol-related problem behavior. When boys had the long variant and girls the short one, the results were reversed. >
> “The impact is very small when only looking at environment or genes in isolation. But there is a tremendous increase in the effect when they are combined”, says Lars Oreland. “

Results have been published in several journals, among them American journal of medical genetics and Journal of biological psychiatry.

Media-related side note: This news is splashed all over the news in Sweden, with zero “anti-genetics” jibes in sight. Which is interesting.
