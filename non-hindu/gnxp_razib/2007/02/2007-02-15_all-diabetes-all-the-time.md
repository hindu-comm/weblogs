All diabetes, all the time

Keeping with the [diabetes theme](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/02/thrifty-genotype-again-and-again.php), the first genome-wide association study of Type II diabetes [has been published](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature05616.html), and it’s extraordinarily promising. Besides picking up the oft-replicated TCF7L2 gene [mentioned before](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/02/thrifty-genotype-again-and-again.php), they pick up three other loci, including finding a non-synonymous mutations in a zinc transporter. That’s notable because 1. non-synonymous mutations clearly can have phenotypic effects (there’s no wondering, could this really do something?), and 2. drug targeting of zinc transport is feasible (TCF7L2 is a transcription factor, and when you start playing with transcription factors you risk messing with a lot of pathways). The [news article accompanying](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7129/full/445688a.html) this study has some good perspective:

> In 1918, Ronald Aylmer Fisher, an evolutionary biologist and pioneer > of modern statistics, published a paper on the genetic causes of > disease that brought together two rival factions. Geneticists promoted > a paradigm in which diseases worked a lot like Mendel’s pea plants, > with just one or two genes responsible for each condition. > Biometricians, however, advocated a continuous distribution of > phenotypes. Fisher suggested that many mendelian traits could result in the continuous distribution of a disease. In doing so, he established the conceptual basis for the search for complex disease genes that continues today. >
> But Fisher’s theories had a more immediate impact on animals and agriculture than on medicine â€” in people, it’s much easier to study and measure mendelian diseases and traits. Even the much-heralded Human Genome Project in the 1990s didn’t help as much as expected.  
> …  
> It has taken time for big GWA studies to be completed. “Many people didn’t know how much association studies would deliver,” says Peter Donnelly, a lead investigator of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, which began collecting samples for GWA studies in 2005. >
> Yet new results, including a study on type 2 diabetes published this week, suggest that the GWA approach will bear fruit, and lots of it….Modern biology may finally have begun to bring technological and scientific rigour to Fisher’s decades-old insights.
