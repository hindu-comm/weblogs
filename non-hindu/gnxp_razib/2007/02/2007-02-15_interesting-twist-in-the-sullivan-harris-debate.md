Interesting twist in the Sullivan-Harris debate

[Sam Harris and Andrew Sullivan have been debating religion.](http://www.beliefnet.com/story/209/story_20904.html) Here’s an interesting excerpt from [Sullivan’s Feb 14 entry](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/02/the_unclean_gla_1.html):

> …That is because I have never met a human being or a human mind that > is “contingency-free”, and never will. **No child grows up without the > contingent facts of their family, place, genes, and any number of > details that make us who we are. You and I would be very different > people if we had different contingent genetics and different > contingent histories.** This is the experience of being human, an > experience eternally different from the dream of your new, unfettered, > purely rational “education,” where the young are severed from the > toxins of contingent culture and faith and family….
