Blogging Heads, is it worth it?

Virginia Postrel [was asking](http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/archives/002495.html) whether [Blogginheads.TV](http://bloggingheads.tv/) was worth it. Most of your probably know that I’m a regular watcher. Some of you might wonder, “Why???” The reason is simple, I don’t own a TV, nor do I read many political blogs or newspaper articles, so it is a cheap way for me to stay hook in to the Zeitgeist of what people who think politics matters think matters right now. Normally I listen to the “debate” in one tab while I’m browsing or doing work. Also, it gives me an opportunity to make fun of the way people look, and mock M. Yglesias, which I enjoy for purely childish reasons. But back to the main issue, is the format worth it? Postrel mentions technical issues, and it seems every other episode has problems with unrecorded diavlogs and what not. Well, check this out:

Jesus. I know ALEXA sucks, but not by an order of magnitude. [Blogginheads.TV](http://bloggingheads.tv/) doesn’t really beat gnxp.com, let alone someone like M. Yglesias. I am pretty shocked to be honest, but I guess only hardcore nerds are really interested in what other nerds have to say.
