Day 3 of hot sauce – Hottest Fuckin’ Sauce

![devilIII.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/03/devilIII.jpg?resize=350%2C230)![devilIII.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/03/devilIII.jpg?resize=350%2C230)As some of you might have noticed, I was not impressed with Hot Sauce \#2. For day 3, I had [pepper-crusted beef, bacon, and arugula sandwiches and spicy mustard](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/233708) with the [Hottest Fuckin’ Sauce](http://www.hotsauceworld.com/hsw1172hf.html). As you can tell by the picture to the left where I’m ***pouring***, yes, ***pouring***, the sauce over my sandwich, this isn’t *that* hot of a concoction. The ingredients listed are: Habanero Peppers, Water, African Oleoresin, Scotch Bonnet Peppers, Salt, Onion, Vegetable Oil, Acetic Acid, Garlic and Xanthan Gum. I don’t know what did it, but this might not be as spicy as [Dave’s Original “Flavorless” Insanity Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Daves-Original-Insanity-Hot-Sauce/dp/B0000DID5R/ref=sr_1_4/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&s=gourmet-food&qid=1175016722&sr=8-4), but there is a richness to the taste which impressed me. Not to be cliche, but this hot sauce brought out the flavor in the food, as opposed to muffling it. In some ways [Hottest Fuckin’ Sauce](http://www.hotsauceworld.com/hsw1172hf.html) reminds me a lot of the home-made habanero sauce I’ve had before. This a definite 8 out of 10.
