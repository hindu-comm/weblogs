Fair & balanced

So I’ve been using google reader to collect the “news” stories which deal with “genetics & evolution” and “human evolution” over the past few weeks. A substantial minority of the former results have been of a Creationist bent, and between 1/3 and 1/2 of the latter have been Creationist columns and opinions. For me, this is a minor irritation (and the reason I last unsubscribed from the “human evolution” query). But if I were a Creationist I am pretty sure that the large number of “news” articles pushing anti-evolutionism would reinforce the position that evolution is a “theory in crisis.” Do no evil?
