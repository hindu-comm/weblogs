Nit-picking

An [article in the Journal of the American Medical Association](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/296/20/2480?ijkey=f60e5968f9f43f6b614769e1ce4f481e397078d9&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) last year made the case for reconsidering studying the genetics of traits like smoking, arguing that the benefits or such research are limited, at best. I don’t totally disagree with the points they make, but statements like this just never should have made it past reviewers:

> \[I\]ncreasingly popular genome-wide association studies have thus far > demonstrated only modest success (ie, logarithmic odds \[LOD\] score > of 2.7 for smoking dependence in identifying influential candidate > genes. What is the likelihood that further studies will ultimately > lead to a gene variant (or gene variants) with both overwhelming > influence and ability to affect significant changes in behavior > commensurate with community-based interventions?

The [study they cite](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.uchicago.edu/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=16671072&dopt=Abstract) is, of course, not a genome-wide association study, but rather a genome-wide *linkage* study. The two are [not that same thing](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/linkage-versus-association-mini-primer.php), and if this reflects a deeper misunderstaning of the different approaches used to map variation underlying traits in humans (as opposed to a simple brain freeze), the authors really have no idea what “the likelihood that further studies will ultimately lead to a gene” is, nor did they bother to think about their question very seriously.

Their article elicited [a response](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/297/8/809), and [the response to the response](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/297/8/810) includes this gem:

> In response to Dr Bierut and colleagues, the central motivation of our > Commentary was not to curtail research funding, and we hope that a > careful reading will dissuade others from this interpretation. Rather, > we argued for wise use of public resources.

Ah, right, of course. Funny how that non-call for curtailing funding included this:

> Genetics studies should be acknowledged as currently **unlikely to > lead to improved lung cancer prevention** compared with the proven, > non-genetic-based strategies for smoking cessation outlined above. > Even as an interim measure, **genetic testing should be secondary in > funding** and emphasis to universal measures to decrease smoking. And > given the obvious dangers of tobacco and the associated imperative to > eliminate it, research undertaken purely to unravel mechanisms of > tobacco-related cancer is **difficult to justify**, unless the > research can be shown to provide insight into fundamental cancer > pathophysiology
