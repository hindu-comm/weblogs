Swappable DNA Module in Bacteria Gives Light Harnessing Ability

[Engineering Bacteria to Harvest Light](http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/18436/)

> …  
> Some bacteria, such as cyanobacteria, use photosynthesis to make > sugars, just as plants do. But others have a newly discovered ability > to harvest light through a different mechanism: using light-activated > proteins known as proteorhodopsins, which are similar to proteins > found in our retinas. When the protein is bound to a light-sensitive > molecule called retinal and hit with light, it pumps positively charged protons across the cell membrane. That creates an electrical gradient that acts as a source of energy, much like the voltage, or electromotive force, supplied by batteries. >
> First discovered in marine organisms in 2000, scientists recently > found that the genes for the proteorhodopsin system – essentially a genetic module that includes the genes that code for both the protein and the enzymes required to produce retinal – are frequently swapped among different microorganisms in the ocean.  
> …  
> Intrigued by the prospect that a single piece of DNA is really all an > organism needs to harvest energy from light, the researchers inserted it into E. coli. They found that the microorganisms synthesized all the necessary components and assembled them in the cell membrane, using the system to generate energy.  
> …  
> The findings have implications for both marine ecology and for > synthetic biology, an emerging field that aims to design and build new > life forms that can perform useful functions. Giant genomic studies of > the ocean have found that the rhodopsin system is surprisingly > widespread. The fact that a single gene transfer can result in an entirely new functionality helps explain how this genetic module traveled so widely. In fact for microbes, this kind of module swapping may be the rule rather than the exception.
