St. Paul vs. the Pharisee on 300

Dienekes [loved 300](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2007/03/300-and-history.html), while an academic specializing in Hellenistic history [did not](http://www.thestar.com/article/190493). I did know about the hoplites from Thespiae (700 of them)…that bothered me, but can you imagine how confusing it would have been to refer to “Thespians” throughout the film?
