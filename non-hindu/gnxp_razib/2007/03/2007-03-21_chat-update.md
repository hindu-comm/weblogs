Chat update

I know many of you are probably sick of chat updates, but please note.

1\) The way the app works right now it autologs you on. But,

2\) I’ve set up a filter so that your randomly assigned nickname (“zanon123…”) won’t show up. You can talk, but you aren’t seen. If you want to be seen on the nick list, just change your nickname with the gray button where your “zanon” handle is, or, type “/nick theNameyouWant” in the command box (IRC-like). If you want to lurk, then keep it “zanon.”

3\) Also, your connection won’t show. I’ll figure out a way to fix the problem with the disconnects which show (but shouldn’t).
