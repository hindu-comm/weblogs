An operational definition of the neutral theory?

I’ve often had the impression that debates about the [neutral theory of molecular evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution) are made confusing by people not defining their terms. Qualitative statements like “drift is more important than selection” tend to get tossed around. So this is from [a recent paper](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/7/2271):

> This theory \[the neutral theory\] posits that the overall pattern of > DNA evolution can be accounted for by mutation, genetic drift, and > negative selection. It does not deny the operation of positive > selection on some loci but only asserts that the overall pattern of > genomic evolution can be explained without invoking adaptive > evolution. Presumably, adaptive changes at any given time involve too > small a fraction of the genome to be a statistically significant > factor, despite their overwhelming biological significance.

I wonder if this is a generally accepted definition. If so, can the neutral theory officially be declared dead (at least for the protein-coding regions of the genome in [*Drosophila*](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/7/2271) and [human](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16237444&dopt=Citation))?
