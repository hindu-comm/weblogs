Historical population genetics @ Dienekes

Dienekes has a [nice post](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2007/03/muslim-and-christian-lebanese-or-hasty.html) up on the follies and failures of historical population genetics. As he notes, part of the problem is that people really want to find *x* instead of !*x*, and with a statistical science that is really, really, bad.
