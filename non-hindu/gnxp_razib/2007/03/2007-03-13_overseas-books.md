Overseas books

I like to buy technical books, and generally I use Abebooks.com, and cross-reference with Amazon, Froogle and MySimon. One thing I’ve noticed (especially Abebooks and Froogle) is that some overseas sellers are dirt cheap. But, being overseas I’m generally reluctant to purchase because I wonder about the hassles if something gets messed up in the chain of delivery. When I mean “overseas,” I’m talking India or Argentina, not Britain (where the books aren’t than much cheaper, if at all, especially taking into account shipping). Any experiences to relate?
