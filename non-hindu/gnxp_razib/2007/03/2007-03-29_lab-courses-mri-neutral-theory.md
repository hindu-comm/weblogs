Lab courses & MRI & Neutral Theory

RPM [has a long post about the importance of lab courses](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/03/philosopher_generalizes_beyond.php) (in response to a [philosopher](https://philosophersplayground.blogspot.com/2007/03/does-learning-science-mean-doing.html) with some background in physics who suggests doing away with undergraduate lab courses) and Aziz points out that [the father of magnetic resonance imaging has died](http://www.refscan.info/2007/03/29/paul-lauterbur-dies-at-age-77/).

**Update:** From the author of the original post (in the comments):

> Actually, I don’t advocate doing away with undergraduate labs. > Undergraduate labs, done well, can be valuable and are essential in > training undergraduate majors in the sciences. What I argue is that > the attitude prevailing at many institutions that every or most theory > classes needs a corresponding lab keeps science departments from being > able to teach classes that would be of great value to students, > especially non-majors.

**Update II:** Also, I’d be remiss in not pointing to RPM’s excellent [intro post](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/03/neutral_expectations.php#more) to Neutral Theory (check out the graphs!).
