SLC45A2 and human skin color

I figured I would just note this, [another skin color study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/114185981/ABSTRACT):

> …We previously reported significant associations of two coding region > polymorphisms with hair, skin, and eye color in Caucasians. Here we > characterize the promoter region of MATP \[*SLC45A2*\] identifying two > new transcription start sites and a novel duplication…A total of 700 > individuals from five different population groups (529 Caucasians, 38 > Asians, 46 African Americans, 47 Australian Aborigines, and 40 Spanish > Basques) were genotyped for known promoter polymorphisms…Allele > frequencies of all three polymorphisms were significantly different > between population groups. In Caucasians, the -1721G, +dup, and -1169A > alleles were significantly associated with olive skin color. The three > promoter polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium with > each other but not with the two previously reported coding region > polymorphisms. Functional analyses in a melanoma cell line showed that > the promoter haplotype -1721G, +dup, -1169A significantly decreased > MATP transcription. This report provides further evidence for the > involvement of MATP in normal pigmentation variation by identifying associations between MATP alleles and skin color variation in Caucasians and demonstrating a functional significance of these polymorphisms.

Convergent evolution on skin color.
