Future archaeogenetic possibilities….

In [The Classical World](https://www.amazon.com/Classical-World-History-Homer-Hadrian/dp/0465024963/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9954258-8060061?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173159564&sr=8-1) by Robin Lane Fox the author contends that the extant evidence suggests that Greek colonies were mainly a male affair,1 and that subsequent generations arose from the union of these men with local women. Over at [my other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/03/cultural_vs_genetic_group_sele.php) I discuss the issues of cultural vs. biological group selection, and the fact that though each parent contributes 1/2 of your genome, they need not contribute 1/2 of your cultural outlook & orientation. I invite those acquainted with the literature on [Magna Graecia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia) to chime in, though Fox being a classicist himself, I am skeptical that his contention is without any support.
