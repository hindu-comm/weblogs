Dig facial hair?

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/hair-785440.jpg)Nature this week has [a news feature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7131/short/446020a.html) on research done by [Angela Christiano](http://www.research.hs.columbia.edu/Faculty_Profiles/profiles/christiano_am.html) into the genetics of various hair-related phenotypes:

I’d never heard of any of the disorders mentioned in the article, but the references are fascinating. There’s the alopecias (a type of which is shown in the bottom picture), one of which is [caused by a recessive mutation](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/279/5351/720) in a transcription factor. Then there’s [hypotrichosis](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v29/n2/images/ng716-F1.jpg), in which hair can grow, but breaks off near the head. This disorder seems to be caused by mutation in [a gene encoding for cell adhesion](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSN-48DVVK5-F&_user=5745&_coverDate=04%2F18%2F2003&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000001358&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=5745&md5=2dae6ad364173004867589a11172316c). She also discovered [the gene that causes a rare disorder](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n11/abs/ng1883.html) in which the affected individuals have no nails on their fingers or toes.

As for the hairy-faced individual in the top picture, the causal mutation is currently unknown, though it seems to be an X-linked recessive trait:
