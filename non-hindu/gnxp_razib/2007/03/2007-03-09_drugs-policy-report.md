Drugs Policy Report

As I have previously posted on the subject of [drugs policy](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/towards-rational-drugs-policy.php), I was interested to see a new report in the UK from a Commission appointed by the **[Royal Society of Arts](http://www.rsa.org.uk/)** (RSA). This is not to be confused with the better known Royal Society of London for the Improving of Natural Knowledge, usually known simply as the **Royal Society**. Nevertheless, the RSA is a respected independent body promoting discussion of public policy issues. In this case it had appointed a Commission chaired by a professor of politics and including experts on various aspects of drugs policy, not least a senior officer at Scotland Yard.

The full report is available [here](http://www.rsadrugscommission.org/) as a 2Mb pdf file. While I havenâ€™t read the full 330-page report line-by-line, it certainly contains a lot of useful information and will contribute to rational debate.
