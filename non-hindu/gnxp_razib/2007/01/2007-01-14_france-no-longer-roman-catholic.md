France no longer Roman Catholic?

Via [Jim Kalb](http://turnabout.ath.cx:8000/node), [France is No Longer a ‘Catholic’ Country](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/10/wfra10.xml). A google translation of a summary of the original report [is here](http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&langpair=fr%7Cen&u=http://www.le-monde-des-religions.fr/edito_num.php&prev=/language_tools). Two points:

1\) In keeping [my earlier contention](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/post-christian-but-not-secular-europe.php), a decline in the dominant organized confession doesn’t mean that all defectors are turning to atheism. A vague (pan)theism remains in place (the translation summary seems to imply that some are switching from “Catholic” to generic “Christian”).

2\) Muslims were 4% of respondents. I’m assuming this excludes the non-religious of ethnicities traditionally Muslim (since they form around 10% of the population).
