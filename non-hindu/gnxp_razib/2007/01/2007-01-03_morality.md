Morality

Below we were talking about morality, and where it comes from. Check out [this story](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2530561,00.html):

> The reason for the controversy is this: three years ago, when Ashley > began to display early signs of puberty, her parents instructed > doctors to remove her uterus, appendix and still-forming breasts, then > treat her with high doses of oestrogen to stunt her growth. >
> In other words, Ashley was sterilised and frozen in time, for ever to > remain a child. She was only 6. >
> … >
> Afflicted with a severe brain impairment known as static > encephalopathy, she cannot walk, talk, keep her head up in bed or even > swallow food. Her parents argued that “keeping her small” was the best > way to improve the quality of her life, not to make life more > convenient for them.

In other news, I’ve just spent considerably more than a “the cost of a cup of coffee every day” \[over a year\] on surgery for my cat. I don’t regret it at all, it was the “right thing to do.” No need for casuistry here.
