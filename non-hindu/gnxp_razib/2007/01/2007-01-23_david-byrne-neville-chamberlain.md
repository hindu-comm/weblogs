David Byrne = Neville Chamberlain?

I like David Byrne. He makes interesting music and visual art, and now he’s making an interesting [journal](http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/11/112006.html).

God is in the wiring, bequeathed by the genes. >

Isn’t all that just a wee bit of a wasteful allocation of resources?)

Super race? “Never yet has there been a superman. I have seen them both naked, the greatest and the smallest men:â€”and they are still all-too-similar to one another. Verily, even the greatest I found to be all-too-human.”
