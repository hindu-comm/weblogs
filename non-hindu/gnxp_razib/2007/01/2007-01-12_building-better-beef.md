Building better beef

[Mad cow disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_cow_disease) is caused by the misfolding of a protein called the [prion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) protein. One might imagine, then, that a cow without said protein would be resistant to mad cow. And indeed, that is [the case](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n1/abs/nbt1271.html):

> Prion diseases are caused by propagation of misfolded forms of the > normal cellular prion protein PrPC, such as PrPBSE in bovine > spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and PrPCJD in > Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. Disruption of PrPC > expression in mice, a species that does not naturally contract prion > diseases, results in no apparent developmental abnormalities. However, > the impact of ablating PrPC function in natural host species of prion > diseases is unknown. Here **we report the generation and > characterization of PrPC-deficient cattle** produced by a sequential > gene-targeting system. At over 20 months of age, the cattle are > clinically, physiologically, histopathologically, immunologically and > reproductively normal. Brain tissue homogenates are resistant to prion > propagation in vitro as assessed by protein misfolding cyclic amplification. **PrPC-deficient cattle may be a useful model for prion research and could provide industrial bovine products free of prion proteins**.

Will it one day be considered irresponsible to produce beef that is *not* genetically modified?
