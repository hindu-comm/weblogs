Pinker on consciousness

[Steven Pinker](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/10-questions-for-steven-pinker.php) has an [article in Time](http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1580394,00.html) called “The Mystery of Consciousness”. An extract:

> What remains is not one problem about consciousness but two, which the > philosopher David Chalmers has dubbed the Easy Problem and the Hard > Problem. Calling the first one easy is an in-joke: it is easy in the sense that curing cancer or sending someone to Mars is easy. That is, scientists more or less know what to look for, and with enough brainpower and funding, they would probably crack it in this century. >
> What exactly is the Easy Problem? It’s the one that Freud made famous, > the difference between conscious and unconscious thoughts. Some kinds > of information in the brain–such as the surfaces in front of you, your > daydreams, your plans for the day, your pleasures and peeves–are > conscious. You can ponder them, discuss them and let them guide your > behavior. Other kinds, like the control of your heart rate, the rules > that order the words as you speak and the sequence of muscle > contractions that allow you to hold a pencil, are unconscious. They must be in the brain somewhere because you couldn’t walk and talk and see without them, but they are sealed off from your planning and reasoning circuits, and you can’t say a thing about them. >
> The Easy Problem, then, is to distinguish conscious from unconscious mental computation, identify its correlates in the brain and explain why it evolved. >
> The Hard Problem, on the other hand, is why it feels like something to > have a conscious process going on in one’s head–why there is > first-person, subjective experience. Not only does a green thing look > different from a red thing, remind us of other green things and > inspire us to say, “That’s green” (the Easy Problem), but it also > actually looks green: it produces an experience of sheer greenness that isn’t reducible to anything else. As Louis Armstrong said in response to a request to define jazz, “When you got to ask what it is, you never get to know.” >
> The Hard Problem is explaining how subjective experience arises from > neural computation. The problem is hard because no one knows what a solution might look like or even whether it is a genuine scientific problem in the first place. And not surprisingly, everyone agrees that the hard problem (if it is a problem) remains a mystery.
