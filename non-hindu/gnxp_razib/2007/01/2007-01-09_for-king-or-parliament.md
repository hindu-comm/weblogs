For King or Parliament?

I am currently reading [The English Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465067565/geneexpressio-20). When I read [God’s War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674023870/geneexpressio-20), a history of the Crusades between 1100 and 1400, it was a rather detached affair. My conscious partisanship toward the West expressed itself in a mild sentimental bias toward its medieval Christian percursor.1 Nevertheless the medieval period is a distant land and it was a survey of a shadow alien landscape from which I wished to glean facts in the service of a general understanding of human affairs and action. Yet my reading of [The English Civil War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465067565/geneexpressio-20) is different, I seem to always “root” for the [Roundheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhead) against the Cavaliers. Perhaps this is because I am an American, and will always smile upon the tribunes of the plebs who have the gall to rise against the armies of the king, but sometimes I wonder if the sentiment does not have deeper origins. In [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056/geneexpressio-20) David Hackett Fisher identified “Four Folkways” in the United States which derive from the pre-1776 British Settlers:

> Families of zealous, literate Puritan yeomen and artisans from > urbanized East Anglia established a religious community in > Massachusetts (1629-40); royalist cavaliers headed by Sir William > Berkeley and young, male indentured servants from the south and west > of England built a highly stratified agrarian way of life in Virginia > (1640-70); egalitarian Quakers of modest social standing from the > North Midlands resettled in the Delaware Valley and promoted a social > pluralism (1675-1715); and, in by far the largest migration (1717-75), poor borderland families of English, Scots, and Irish fled a violent environment to seek a better life in a similarly uncertain American backcountry.

My own personal background is at the nexus between the Puritan and Midland folkways. I once told a friend that when going through the Civil War period **I always knew who the good guys were**. (the Blues of course!) Only later on with the awareness of adulthood did I comprehend the nature of “the Lost Cause,” or the reality that the Roundheads were arguably more tyrannical than the Cavaliers. Other biases lurk in my mind, when I read [The Reformation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670032964/geneexpressio-20/) I leaned toward the Protestants, even though I knew the rough sketch of the outcomes. This, though I am aware of, and attempt to ward myself from, the sin of anti-Catholic prejudice which suffuses the Anglo-American intellectual tradition.

I am immigrant, strictly speaking, to this nation. Though schooled nowhere else I am visibly different from the majority of the citizens, and was a conscious alien as a child. Nevertheless, it is clear that I have internalized the subtle biases and outlooks of the “the Yankee,” whatever that is. Part of the explanation perhaps lay with the thesis of [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20), my peers have generally been northern Yankees, and so I became. Additionally, **my teachers always knew who the “good guys” were, even if they wouldn’t say it in so many words**. I am curious, what biases do readers feel themselves stumbling upon? In our society we are taught to reflect & explore “latent” bias on the dimensions of sex and race, but what about the unconscious “folkways” which we imbibe through the banal processes of socialization?

1 – Though I have admitted a faint and reflexive attraction to the harmonies of the call to prayer because of childhood memories, in general I find Islamic civilization a cold and dour affair and am not particularly disposed toward it.
