Race site

I’ve received several emails about this website, [Understanding Race](http://www.understandingrace.org/humvar/index.html). Here is a [article](http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/01/11/race) about the project. I don’t have much to say, the readers of this blog can decompose assertions like this easily enough I assume:

> The pattern of DNA across populations shows a nested subset. African populations harbor some alleles (gene variations) that are absent in non-African populations; however, **all of the alleles that are common in non-African populations are also common in African populations**.

The English here is peculiar. If African populations are more polymorphic, wouldn’t it stand to reason that the common (derived) alleles in non-Africans must be less common in Africans? (since you can’t have more than 100%?) In any case, loci such as [MC1R](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=mc1r&btnG=Search+google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) invert this stark narrative. In attempting to replace an outmoded racial typology derived from Victorian imaginations and social contexts anti-racists construct their own ghostly strawmen which are a mirror of the old Platonic constructs.

I have little more to say than to exhort you to hold truth close to your hearts, the follies of the deceivers will then stand naked before you.
