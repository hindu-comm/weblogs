Icelandic fire

This week’s Lancet has a [profile of Kari Stefansson](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1B-4MX0997-K&_user=10&_coverDate=02%2F02%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=b3221b219e2b451e30131cff549f56f6), CEO of [DeCode Genetics](http://www.decode.com/). Regular readers have been exposed to much of the groundbreaking research done by the company, which has DNA samples from \~65% of the Icelandic population and a geneology that stretches back 1000 years. This is the group that published on the “[fertility inversion](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003455.html)“, alleles that cause an [ethnic-group-specific risk for heart disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16282974&query_hl=1), and generally has been one of the few groups to have success finding alleles that contribute to succeptibility for complex diseases like [prostate cancer](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n6/abs/ng1808.html) or [diabetes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16415884&dopt=Citation).

Could anyone with a dataset as good as the entire Icelandic population pull this off? Stefansson:

His repsponse to a question we’ve often asked interviewees– any interest in your own genome sequence?

> Stefansson says that he is not planning to follow Craig Venter’s > example and have his own DNA sequenced. “My mother died at the age of > 62. My father died at the age of 67. And therefore I have been very > diligent about avoiding to learn anything about my own disease > predisposition”, he says. “I want to die ignorant of my weaknesses.”
