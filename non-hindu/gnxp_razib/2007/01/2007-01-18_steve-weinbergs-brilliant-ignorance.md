Steve Weinberg’s brilliant ignorance

[PZ](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/i_am_so_happy_that_steven_wein.php) and [John](http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2007/01/weinberg_on_expertise.php) have commented on a [Steve Weinberg](http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25349-2552017.html) review of [The God Delusion](http://www.scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/10/the_god_delusion_amongst_the_u_1.php). This prompts me to offer up a cheap reflection which I’ve been meaning to air since watching [Beyond Belief 2006](http://beyondbelief2006.org/), Steve Weinberg was, to my eye, the most ignorant and complacent of all the speakers and panelists, **while at the same time being likely the most incandescently brilliant of them all**. Weinberg is a great physicist, but having him review [The God Delusion](http://www.scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/10/the_god_delusion_amongst_the_u_1.php) is like giving Leon Kass [The Party of Death](https://www.amazon.com/Party-Death-Democrats-Courts-Disregard/dp/1596980044/sr=1-1/qid=1169106087/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1267539-8300147?ie=UTF8&s=books). On a related note, over at [The Secular Outpost](https://secularoutpost.blogspot.com/2007/01/do-more-aggressive-skeptics.html), Taner Edis wonders if Sam Harris shouldn’t know something about the religions which he criticizes. Now, mind you, I do not tend to value theology very highly. Unlike other Nevilles I tend to fault Dawkins et. al. more for their lack of psychological sophistication than philosophical depth. But the point stands.  
**Addendum:** Let me add that I can’t but feel some joy that a brilliant man such Steven Weinberg is an atheist, one of “my kind.” But I have to admit that that joy is diminished watching him engage someone like Scott Atran, who though lacking in the mental acuity and raw firepower of a Weinberg, knows the lay of the land (religion that is) well enough to make the mighty seem like fallen fools.
