How swarthy are the Sami?

![renee-zellweger-picture-1.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/07/renee-zellweger-picture-1.jpg?resize=200%2C178)![renee-zellweger-picture-1.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2007/07/renee-zellweger-picture-1.jpg?resize=200%2C178)Someone asked below if the [Sami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people) are actually darker than the Finns. Since I’ve been making this assumption in previous posts I thought I’d check this out. I found [this source](https://finnanthro.blogspot.com/2007/02/sami-of-finnish-lapland.html) for the Finnish Sami where they cite a 1936 paper written in German. I’ve translated the relevant table (hair and skin color) below. The source above also has data on some provinces of central and southern Finland where one presumes the Sami presence is minimal, though I can’t vouch for proper calibration of the metrics, I’ve included the appropriate snippets.

Data from parts of southern Finland:
