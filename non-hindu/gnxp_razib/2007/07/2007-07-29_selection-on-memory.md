Selection on memory?

Razib recently mentioned [a paper](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0702923104v1?etoc) on a polymorphism regulating memory in *Drosophila*. As I often do when studies like these are published, I determined the human homologue of the gene in question (PRKG1, in this case), and checked out [the plots of summary statistics](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm) available online. Sure enough, there are peaks in the significance of iHS, Tajima’s D, and Fay and Wu’s H in the area (all signs of recent selection), though strikingly these peaks are only evident in the Asian population. Hm.
