Pedo amygdala

I did a poor job asking pubmed for the paper Razib mentioned earlier, but this surely does look interesting:

> Brain pathology in pedophilic offenders: evidence of volume reduction in the right amygdala and related diencephalic structures.  
> Kolja Schiltz, Joachim Witzel, Georg Northoff, Kathrin Zierhut, Udo Gubka, Hermann Fellmann, JÃ¶rn Kaufmann, Claus Tempelmann, Christine Wiebking, Bernhard Bogerts >
> CONTEXT: Pedophilic crime causes considerable public concern, but no > causative factor of pedophilia has yet been pinpointed. In the past, > etiological theories postulated a major impact of the environment, but > recent studies increasingly emphasize the role of neurobiological > factors, as well. However, the role of alterations in brain structures > that are crucial in the development of sexual behavior has not yet > been systematically studied in pedophilic subjects. OBJECTIVE: To > examine whether pedophilic perpetrators show structural neuronal > deficits in brain regions that are critical for sexual behavior and > how these deficits relate to criminological characteristics. DESIGN: > Amygdalar volume and gray matter of related structures that are > critical for sexual development were compared in 15 nonviolent male > pedophilic perpetrators (forensic inpatients) and 15 controls using > complementary morphometric analyses (voxel-based morphometry and > volumetry). Psychosocial adjustment and sexual offenses were also > assessed. RESULTS: Pedophilic perpetrators showed a significant > decrease of right amygdalar volume, compared with healthy controls (P > = .001). We observed reduced gray matter in the right amygdala, > hypothalamus (bilaterally), septal regions, substantia innominata, and > bed nucleus of the striae terminalis. In 8 of the 15 perpetrators, > enlargement of the anterior temporal horn of the right lateral > ventricle that adjoins the amygdala could be recognized by routine > qualitative clinical assessment. Smaller right amygdalar volumes were > correlated with the propensity to commit uniform pedophilic sexual > offenses exclusively (P = .006) but not with age (P = .89). > CONCLUSIONS: Pedophilic perpetrators show structural impairments of > brain regions critical for sexual development. These impairments are > not related to age, and their extent predicts how focused the scope of > sexual offenses is on uniform pedophilic activity. Subtle defects of > the right amygdala and closely related structures might be implicated in the pathogenesis of pedophilia and might possibly reflect developmental disturbances or environmental insults at critical periods
