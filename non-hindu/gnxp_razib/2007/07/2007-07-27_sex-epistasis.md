Sex & epistasis

Since we’re talking about [sex & evolution](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/07/unsexy-crayfish.php) I thought I would pass on this *PNAS* paper, [Coevolution of robustness, epistasis, and recombination favors asexual reproduction](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0705455104v1) (my emphasis). I covered [statistical epistasis](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/through-rugged-roads-of-gene-land.php) a few years ago, and at that point I was being told that [synergistic epistasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sex#Sex_acts_to_encourage_removal_of_deleterious_genes) was the critical cog that kept the species a rollin’ and a rockin’. But perhaps not (the paper is **Open Access**).
