GNXP blocked by Websense

From a reader:

> I thought you might find this interesting and sad. I tried to log on > to gnxp from work yesterday- web access was blocked by Websense > (cisco) – reason- racial hatred. A pathetic sign of the times. Luckily I have a 3g capable smartphone so I was able to log on. But that really sucks. BTW instapundit was also blocked – reason – weapons. PC = damnation!
