Muslim Creationism: morons a publishin’

*The New York Times* has a funny article up, [Islamic Creationist and a Book Sent Round the World](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17book.html?pagewanted=all), which recounts the mass distribution (*gratis*) of Harun Yahya’s latest tract, a lavishly illustrated and packaged glossy book which aims to show that evolution didn’t occur. This is chuckle worthy:

> He said people who had received copies were “just astounded at its size and production values and equally astonished at what a load of crap it is.  
> “If he sees a picture of an old fossil crab or something, he says, > ‘See, it looks just like a regular crab, there’s no evolution,’ ” Dr. Padian said. “Extinction does not seem to bother him. **He does not really have any sense of what we know about how things change through time**.”  
> ….  
> While they said they were unimpressed with the book’s content, > recipients marveled at its apparent cost. “If you went into a bookstore and saw a book like this, it would be at least \$100,” said Dr. Miller, an author of conventional biology texts. “The production costs alone are astronomical. We are talking millions of dollars.”

Check out Harun Yahya’s [extended biography](http://www.harunyahya.com/theauthor2.php) (this is under his real name). Jump down to the “Cocaine Conspiracy” section, it’s pretty bizarre. Harun Yahya is obviously a major league tard, and he is clearly dull and deluded enough he doesn’t know how transparent his tardation is. The gaudy bling-bling Creationism is similar to the pap put out by the Institute of Creation Science, and his attempts to promote himself as a Renaissance Man who is the master of all he surveys are Dembski worthy. My main question is this: **who is funding this trash?**  
**Update:** Hey, I have a life so I can’t monitor this weblog 24-7. I suspect that the influx of tards has been triggered by people coming through the trackback to the original article in *The New York Times* (this weblog is heavily linked to on “The Sphere” service that *The New York Times* uses). I’m going to close comments, though I invite regular readers to check out some of the tardish comments that popped up. They’re almost as hilarious as Harun Yahya’s website. I mean, yes, Creationism is bad; but such sincere morons are an exotic species to me since I am careful to avoid people at the first sign of tardation. It’s been a long time since I expended time arguing with Creationists, but at least “Yahya” and his tardish followers are too dumb to engage in serious sophistry. An analogy would be holding minors and adults accountable for crimes. Obviously minors should be held accountable in some manner, but not to the same extent or degree as adults who are presumed to be able to make more rational and premeditated choices. Though honestly, I feel like I’m insulting children by comparing them with the tard mentalities on display here.
