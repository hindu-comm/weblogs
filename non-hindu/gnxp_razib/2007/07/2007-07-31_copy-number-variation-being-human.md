Copy number variation & being human

[Gene Duplications Give Clues to Humanness](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/730/4?rss=1):

> **All told, the researchers found more than 4000 genes that showed > lineage-specific changes in copy number, with the numbers steadily > increasing over evolutionary time**. Humans, for example, only had 84 > genes with increased copy numbers over those of our closet relatives. > In contrast, lemurs, which have evolved for 60 million years, have > 1180 genes with extra copies. “This is further evidence that genomic > differences between humans and other primates is far, far more complex > than we originally imagined they might be,” says Ajit Varki, who studies human/chimpanzee differences at the University of California, San Diego. “However, many of the differences may or may not be relevant for explaining ‘humanness.'”

We’ve talked about [copy number variation](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/hapmap-and-copy-number-variation.php) before. Obviously dosage of gene products can be directly impacted by this. We’ve come a long way from non-synonymous base pair changes baby! Though please note that **loss of function** (fewer copies) might be just as important as gain of function (more copies).
