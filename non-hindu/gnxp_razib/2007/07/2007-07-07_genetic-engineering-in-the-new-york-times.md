Genetic engineering in The New York Times

Nick Wade has a [short piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/weekinreview/08wade.html?ref=science) on “synthetic biology” (bioengineering) in The New York Times. When pieces such as these disappear from the science pages we’ll know that biological engineering has arrived on the scene, the mundane and everyday is simply not newsworthy.
