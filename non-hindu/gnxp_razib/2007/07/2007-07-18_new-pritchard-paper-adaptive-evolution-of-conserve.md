New Pritchard paper, Adaptive evolution of conserved non-coding elements in mammals

Jonathan Pritchard has a new provisional paper, [Adaptive evolution of conserved non-coding elements in mammals](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030147.eor), in *PLOS Genetics*:

> Conserved non-coding elements (CNCs) are an abundant feature of > vertebrate genomes. Some CNCs have been shown to act as cis-regulatory > modules but the function of most CNCs remains unclear. To study the > evolution of CNCs we have developed a statistical method called the > ‘shared rates test’ (SRT) to identify CNCs that show significant > variation in substitution rates across branches of a phylogenetic > tree. We report an application of this method to alignments of 98,910 > CNCs from the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse and rat genomes. We find > that 68% of CNCs evolve according to a null model where, for each CNC, > a single parameter models the level of constraint acting throughout > the phylogeny linking these five species. The remaining 32% of CNCs > show departures from the basic model including speed-ups and > slow-downs on particular branches and occasionally multiple > rate-changes on different branches. We find that a subset of the > significant CNCs have evolved significantly faster than the local > neutral rate on a particular branch, providing strong evidence for > adaptive evolution in these CNCs. The distribution of these signals on > the phylogeny suggests that adaptive evolution of CNCs occurs in > occasional short bursts of evolution. Our analyses suggest a large set > of promising targets for future functional studies of adaptation.

Interestingly, there another paper [another paper](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/07/noncoding_but_fitness_implicat.php) out in *PNAS* which speaks to the possibility of non-coding genomic regions in humans having functional significance.
