Small teeth & sexual dimorphism?

In highly polygynous species males in their prime are the fathers of a multitude. These species’ males enter into a winner-take-all lottery game when it comes to reproduction. It makes sense that these males wouldn’t live that long. It isn’t likely that they could greatly increase the fitness of their numerous offspring through parental investment simply because there might be so many of them. Male investment in humans makes some sense in the case where a typical man may have only a few children who survive to their reproductive years. Nevertheless, there is some [reproductive skew](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002883.html) within our own species, and the extent of that skew varies from population to population and across historical epochs. The reproductive outcome for the total population may remain the same no matter if it is characterized by a equilibrium of low risk & low yield male strategies, or high risk and high yield strategies, but the dynamics within the society are likely going to be very different. I am not convinced that our current low risk & low yield strategy (i.e., monogamous pair-bonding) isn’t just a [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_molecules) situation, highly susceptible to disruption.
