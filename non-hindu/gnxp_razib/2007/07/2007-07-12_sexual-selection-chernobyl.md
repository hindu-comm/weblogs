Sexual selection @ Chernobyl

About one month ago Ruchira Paul [posted](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2007/06/radiant_ecology.html) on the ecology around Chernobyl and the surprising bounce back of some taxa. *The Economist* has some interesting [detail](http://economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9468786) about the nature of this revival:

> …they found that species which relied on a class of chemicals called > carotenoids to tint their feathers fared worse when there was more > radioactivity around. Intriguingly, that did not apply to birds that > used melanin….  
> Besides acting as pigments, carotenoids are antioxidants that have an > important role in protecting DNA from harm. One of the ways that > radiation causes harm is by generating molecules that promote > oxidation, so a good supply of carotenoids protects against such > damage. Using them to make feathers pretty instead of mopping up > oxidative molecules thus has a significant cost–as this result > shows.

Too much in discussion about sexual selection in the context of evolutionary biology operates so that it appears like a *deux ex machina* to rescue us. Like genetic drift too often people use sexual selection as a catchall explanation for traits which they can’t understand in an adaptive context. **But though drift and sexual selection are real evolutionary forces it is important to remember that both are subject to conventional population genetic parameters**. Additionally, theories of sexual selection [come in varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection#Viability_and_variations_of_the_theory), with some being rather more arbitrary than others. Sexual selection maybe stochastic, but the sample space of possibilities does not seem infinite or unconstrained.
