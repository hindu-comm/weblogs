Breastfeeding & IQ & norm of reaction

[Moderation of breastfeeding effects on the IQ by genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0704292104v1):

> …Breastfed children attain higher IQ scores than children not fed > breast milk, presumably because of the fatty acids uniquely available > in breast milk. Here we show that the association between > breastfeeding and IQ is moderated by a genetic variant in *FADS2*, a > gene involved in the genetic control of fatty acid pathways. We > confirmed this gene-environment interaction in two birth cohorts, and > we ruled out alternative explanations of the finding involving > gene-exposure correlation, intrauterine growth, social class, and > maternal cognitive ability, as well as maternal genotype effects on > breastfeeding and breast milk. The finding shows that environmental > exposures can be used to uncover novel candidate genes in complex > phenotypes. It also shows that genes may work via the environment to > shape the IQ, helping to close the nature versus nurture debate.

This reminds me a lot of the findings from a study of polymorphism on [*MAOA*](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002363.html). One allele exhibited sensitivity toward environmental variation, while the other did not. This is a pretty simple [norm of reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norms_of_reaction#A_monoclonal_example), genotypes differently influenced by the same background environmental condition. [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/11/05/breastfeeding-and-iq-the-genetic-factor) has more detail. Check out the population differences of the [two](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=174575) [SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1535)s they looked at on *FADS2*.

Read it [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/11/breastfeeding_iq_norm_of_react.php).

**Update:** [Eye on DNA](http://www.eyeondna.com/2007/11/06/fads2-gene-linked-to-higher-iq-in-breastfed-children/) has much more.

**Jason M. adds**: In the comments **HapMap Jockey Marc** [again](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/james-watson-tells-inconvenient-truth_296.php) applies the wisdom from p-ter’s [HapMap How-2](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/09/so-you-want-to-be-population-geneticist.php) to the latest IQ genes:

> In the study itself, there were two cohorts: a British cohort and a > New Zealand cohort. In both cohorts, presence of the C allele (as > either CC or CG) was associated with a hike in IQ by 6.4 and 7.0 > points (from around 99-100 to around 106) in the two samples. But > those without the C allele (GG) had mean IQs of 99.5 in Britain and > 100.3 in New Zealand. >
> Incidentally, I plugged rs174575 into the ol’ Hapmap, and it seems > that the C allele has a frequency rate of 72% among Utah whites, 73% > among Yorubans, 89% among the Chinese, and 90% among the Japanese. >
> Assuming these numbers are representative, universal breastfeeding > alone would lead to a gap of 1.12 to 1.225 in IQs between East Asians > and whites, favoring East Asians. >
> On the other hand, since whites and blacks have nearly the same C > allele frequency (assuming, again that these numbers are > representative of white and black populations), but whites breastfeed > their babies at higher rates than blacks (60% vs. 30%, according to > Steve), this is pretty solid evidence that increasing the percentage > of black women who breastfeed their children will have a diminishing > effect on the black white IQ gap. >
> Since I’m already blowing off work (damn you, Gene Expression!) I > might as well do the calculations. Let’s see… The 30% difference in > breastfeeding is responsible for between 1.4 and 1.53 points in the > black-white IQ gap! (I got these figures by multiplying the frequency > rate of the C allele in Yorubans with the percentage difference in > breastfeeding between blacks and whites with the effects of > breastfeeding on the IQs of C allele carriers.) >
