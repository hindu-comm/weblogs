Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory, follow up

Just a note, as I’ve read most of it now I’m starting to think that Alan Templeton’s [Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471409510/geneexpressio-20/) is an excellent complement to R.A. Fisher’s classic [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/). Fisher’s prose is dense, and sometimes it is a bit much to extract clarity from his somewhat turgid early 20th century style. The wordiness which I complained about earlier serves Templeton well in clarifying concepts Fisher introduced such as average excess, *a*, and average effect, α, but did not elaborate upon in great detail.¹ Where Fisher might define a concept with a few sweeping allusions to statistical and genetic concepts over two or three pages Templeton might spend half a chapter and round out the exposition with helpful charts, graphs and tables.

  
1 – You probably might object that Fisher spends a fair amount of time on average excess & effect, but I think Templeton does a really good job in relating the two terms in an algebraic manner which makes it really clear how best to use and conceive of them. I think Fisher’s treatment is mostly intelligible, but *mostly* isn’t really the optimal situation when it comes to the ideas presented in [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/).
