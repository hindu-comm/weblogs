Firefox that works?

I’ve gotten tired of Firefox freezing when Newsweek.com (and other sites) loads. Recently Firefox started freezing in gmail when I tried to use the search. But the UI for Safari, Opera and IE are inferior in my opinion. Any recs for something similar to Firefox that doesn’t freeze all the time?
