Drinking in Europe

Nothing too surprising in this [story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7093143.stm) about attitudes toward alcohol in Europe. From Finland:

> Since the government cut tax on alcohol by one third in March 2004, deaths and diseases from alcohol have all jumped by similar amounts in hard-drinking Finland. >
> The cut was made due to cheap alcohol imports from neighbouring Estonia.

People respond to tax incentives!
