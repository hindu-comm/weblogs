Questioning the breastfeeding & IQ link

A few weeks ago I reported some research that seemed to show a relationship between a gain in IQ due to breastfeeding and a particular genetic variant. Looks like I spoke too soon. [p-ter has the goods](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/questioning-breastfeeding-iq-fads2.php):

This is the classic problem that [Judith Rich Harris](http://home.att.net/~xchar/tna/) points on in her work, many researchers just don’t control for the correlation between parents and offspring genetically.
