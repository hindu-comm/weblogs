Blogwars on the Left & Right

I don’t post much on politics because I really have little value to add. And with my [diverse readership](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?SurveyID=56717) in regards to politics I can’t really be throwing posts to the effect of “look at these idiotic conservatives/liberals!!!” and expect to get a bunch of “right on!” comments in response. But I do pay cursory attention to the political blogosphere via my RSS, and I was struck by simultaneous fissures emerging on the Left and Right blogosphere for Godwinesque reasons.  
On the right, [Little Green Footballs](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=27894_Interviewed_by_Tom_Paine&only) is trying to purge the anti-jihadist movement of fascists. Specifically the involvement of [Brussels Journal](http://www.brusselsjournal.com/) with Far Right politics in Europe. Meanwhile, on the Left [Glenn Greenwald](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/11/12/paul/index.html) has been engaging in quite a bit of Ron Paul apologia. The primary issue is that some of Paul’s supporters are not particularly pleasant, e.g., Neo-Nazis, etc. My own general opinion is political coalitions are tribes, and generally if you are of a particular camp you deemphasize disagreements. That makes it **really boring** for those of us who don’t follow the details in this area. When cracks open up along the common front and allies begin sniping at each other it’s really fun because you start to see the nuts & bolts, the ideological infrastructure, which lurks beneath the surface. Treachery makes great drama!
