More genes please!

[Targeted discovery of novel human exons by comparative genomics](http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/gr.7128207v1):

> Here we describe a genome-wide effort, carried out as part of the > Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project, to identify human genes not > yet in the gene catalogs. Our approach was to produce gene predictions > by algorithms that rely on comparative sequence data but do not > require direct cDNA evidence, then to test predicted novel genes by > RT-PCR. We have identified 734 novel gene fragments (NGFs) containing > 2188 exons with, at most, weak prior cDNA support. These NGFs > correspond to an estimated 563 distinct genes, of which \>160 are > completely absent from the major gene catalogs, while hundreds of > others represent significant extensions of known genes. The NGFs > appear to be predominantly protein-coding genes rather than noncoding > RNAs, unlike novel transcribed sequences identified by technologies > such as tiling arrays and CAGE. They tend to be expressed at low > levels and in a tissue-specific manner, and they are enriched for > roles in motor activity, cell adhesion, connective tissue, and central > nervous system development. Our results demonstrate that many > important genes and gene fragments have been missed by traditional > approaches to gene discovery but can be identified by their evolutionary signatures using comparative sequence data. However, they suggest that hundreds–not thousands–of protein-coding genes are completely missing from the current gene catalogs.
