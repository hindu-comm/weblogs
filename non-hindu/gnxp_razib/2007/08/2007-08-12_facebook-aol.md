Facebook ~ AOL?

[Facebook Grows Up](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20227872/site/newsweek/page/0/):

> What does Facebook get from this? If all goes well, much of what > people do on the Internet will be accomplished within Facebook. > Instead of eBay, you can buy in Facebook’s marketplace. Instead of iTunes, there’s iLike. **In other words, Zuckerberg wants to keep you-student, graduate or graybeard-logged on to Facebook**, organizing virtually everything you do via the social graph.

AOL, [PointCast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PointCast_%28dotcom%29), the portal sites. I think the past 10 years has shown that you better focus on what you can do well before doing everything.
