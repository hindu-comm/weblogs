Gregory Clark in The Times

The (UK) Times seems to be getting frisky in its old age. A few days ago there was Matthew Syed’s article on race and IQ (see a few posts down), and today the Times has an [article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article2280334.ece) by Gregory Clark, summarising the thesis of his book Farewell to Alms. I don’t personally find the thesis very convincing (was England really so different from other European countries in its demographic patterns?) but it is certainly intriguing.
