Man as an instrument & eugenics

There has been a lot of comment on the blogosphere about eugenics. From the Right, Ross Douthat [here](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/i_feel_like_im_taking_crazy_pi.php), [here](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/an_unconvincing_analogy_1.php) &
[here](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/i_feel_like_im_taking_crazy_pi.php), from the Left Ezra Klein [here](http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/eugenics.html), [here](http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/more-on-eugenic.html) & [here](http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/more-on-eugen-1.html), Kevin Drum [here](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_07/011785.php) & Henry Farrell [here](http://crookedtimber.org/2007/07/31/progressives-and-eugenics). And from the libertarian angle the Elf [here](http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009947.php). Since a few of my posts were referenced I added a bit [here](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/07/eugenics-whats-in-term.php) & [here](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/07/eugenics-schmgenics.php). I think I’m pretty clear about “eugenics,” and biological technologies. I’m not a “bio-utopian,” but I think the future is coming and we need to grapple with it. I’m not scared of the word eugenics, but accept that the new biological technologies and choices will have a far broader purview than the original eugenics, and of course the term is a non-starter in any case. My attitude is that we have to be pragmatic and need to shy away from grand pronouncements and take things on a case by case basis. For example, here is a story from England, [‘Use IVF to create more saviour siblings’](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/01/nivf101.xml):

> For the first time, couples could use so-called “saviour siblings” to treat other family members suffering the kind of serious but non-fatal ailments that affect millions.  
> Presently the law allows parents to use IVF procedures to select embryos that will be a genetic match to older siblings with life-threatening diseases, such as a rare blood disorder.  
> But a joint House of Commons and Lords committee today calls for the law to be relaxed to include other illnesses.  
> This could lead to children being created to help treat diseases such as sickle-cell anaemia, renal failure, kidney disorders and spinal diseases.

So how do you feel about this? That’s a much more fruitful and relevant discussion than the historical resonances of the term eugenics.
