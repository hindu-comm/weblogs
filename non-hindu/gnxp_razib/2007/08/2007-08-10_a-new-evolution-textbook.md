A new evolution textbook

[Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878931872/geneexpressio-20) by Doug Futuyma & and [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405103450/geneexpressio-20) by Mark Ridley are probably two the most common intro texts used by instructors. Well, there’s an enormous new textbook out creatively titled [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0879696842//geneexpressio-20). Here is the important bit from the [website](http://www.evolution-textbook.org/):

> Evolution, to be published on June 27, 2007, is designed to serve as > the primary text for undergraduate courses in evolution. It differs > from currently available alternatives in containing more molecular > biology than is traditionally the case. But this is not at the expense > of traditional evolutionary theory. Indeed, a glance at the Table of > Contents and the authors’ interests reveals the range of material > covered in this book. The authors are world-renowned in population > genetics, bacterial genomics, paleontology, human genetics, and > developmental biology. The integration of molecular biology and > evolutionary biology reflects the current direction of much research > among evolutionary scientists. Click here to read more.

The book is being published by [Cold Spring Harbor Press](http://www.cshlpress.com/splash.html?cart=11867667392503240&).
