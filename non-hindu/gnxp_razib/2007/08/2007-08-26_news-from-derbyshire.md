News from Derbyshire

I tend to assume that all people of taste and intelligence (e.g. readers of **Gene Expression**) will regularly check out **[John Derbyshire’s](http://www.olimu.com/)** site, but in case they don’t, [here](http://www.olimu.com/WebJournalism/2007/Texts/IslamAndChristianity.htm) is his brilliant review of a book by **Robert Spencer**.
