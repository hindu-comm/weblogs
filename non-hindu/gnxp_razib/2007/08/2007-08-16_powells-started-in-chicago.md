Powell’s started in Chicago

For the Northwestern bibliophiles, did you know that [Powell’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell%27s) started in Chicago? I did not. There is a small Powell’s bookstore (the original) about 5 blocks east of the University of Chicago. Seeing the exact same font on the sign and the name is pretty strange if you aren’t expecting to stumble upon it.
