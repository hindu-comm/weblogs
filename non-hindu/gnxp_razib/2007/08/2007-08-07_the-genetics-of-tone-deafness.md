The genetics of tone deafness

There’s an [“old-school”](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v81n3/44745/brief/44745.abstract.html) article in the most recent American Journal of Human Genetics on familial aggregation in tone deafness:

> Congenital amusia (commonly known as “tone deafness”) is a lifelong > impairment of music perception that affects 4% of the population. To > estimate whether congenital amusia can be genetically transmitted, its > prevalence was quantified by direct auditory testing of 71 members of > 9 large families of amusic probands, as well as of 75 members of 10 > control families. The results confirm that congenital amusia is > expressed by a deficit in processing musical pitch but not musical > time and also show that the pitch disorder has a hereditary component. > **In amusic families, 39% of first-degree relatives have the same > cognitive disorder, whereas only 3% have it in the control families**. > The identification of multiplex families with a high relative risk of experiencing a musical pitch deficit (lambda_s = 10.8; 95% confidence interval 8-13.5) enables the mapping of genetic loci for hereditary amusia.

I imagine it’s difficult to get money to study this sort of phenotype, but eventually the technology will be cheap enough. I wonder, though, if any sort of “genetic counseling” company (if such a thing exists) would pony up the cash to find genes involved in tone deafness. Offering the ability to test for and select non-tone deaf embryos for IVF could be a lucrative niche market.
