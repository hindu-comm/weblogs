The authors used conditioned taste aversion (you may be familiar with this learning paradigm if you’ve ever made yourself sick off tequila). Injection of a peptide inhibitor of this enzyme (PKM zeta) completely removed the aversive association. This isn’t a paper about how to erase memories for any clinical application because, for instance, injecting the drug erases multiple olfactory associations (i.e. we don’t have a clue how to achieve specificity). It is a paper about how memory works, and it is pretty remarkable that a simple mechanism like persistent kinase activation may be central to this neural function.
