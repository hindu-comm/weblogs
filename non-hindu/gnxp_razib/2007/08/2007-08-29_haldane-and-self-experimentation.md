Haldane and self-experimentation

No, not that Haldane. His father. [Seth Roberts points](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/08/28/annals-of-self-experimentation-j-s-haldane/) [to](http://www.spectator.co.uk/printer-friendly/books/68993/a-healthy-enthusiasm-for-danger.thtml) [several](http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1260292007) [reviews](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/biography/article2185353.ece) of a new biography of JS Haldane. He was apparently quite the self-experimenter:

> He survived concentrations of carbon monoxide in the blood that would, > as his biographer notes, have looked entirely plausible as the ’cause > of death’ on a death certificate. ‘Dry air,’ Goodman writes, ‘he could > withstand to an astounding high of 300F, though if he moved about too > much his hair began to singe.’ Working in 99F ‘dry bulb’ heat, on one > occasion, a colleague gave up after half an hour with a rectal > temperature of 102.4F; Haldane went on for another 30 minutes. He > spent hours and hours breathing toxic air and taking careful, > methodical notes of its effects. He gassed himself with chlorine, > methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, pure oxygen, nitrogen, > mustard gas and god knows what else in various combinations… you name > it, he turned blue and passed out on it. And, typically, no sooner had > he come back round than he returned to the chamber to have another go.
