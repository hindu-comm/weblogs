Computational neuroscience & evolution

[Distributed Representations Accelerate Evolution of Adaptive Behaviours](http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030147&ct=1):

> Some behaviours are purely innate (e.g., blinking), whereas other, > “apparently innate,” behaviours require a degree of learning to refine > them into a useful skill (e.g., nest building). In terms of biological > fitness, it matters how quickly such learning occurs, because time > spent learning is time spent not eating, or time spent being eaten, > both of which reduce fitness. Using artificial neural networks as > model organisms, it is proven that it is possible for an organism to > be born with a set of “primed” connections which guarantee that > learning part of a skill induces automatic learning of other skill > components, an effect known as free-lunch learning (FLL). Critically, > this effect depends on the assumption that associations are stored as > distributed representations. Using a genetic algorithm, it is shown > that primed organisms can evolve within 30 generations. This has three > important consequences. First, primed organisms learn quickly, which > increases their fitness. Second, the presence of FLL effectively > accelerates the rate of evolution, for both learned and innate skill > components. Third, FLL can accelerate the rate at which learned > behaviours become innate. These findings suggest that species may > depend on the presence of distributed representations to ensure rapid > evolution of adaptive behaviours.
