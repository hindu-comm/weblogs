Demon rum

What’s going on here? As a great man once said, maybe it’s agriculture?

Though seriously, I doubt that protection against alcoholism here is a major issue. So why is it being selected? Who knows. It seems likely that ADH1B is somehow involved in metabolization of various biochemicals which might have fitness implications. What are these populations consuming? And what aren’t the other populations consuming? Or, perhaps they’re consuming similar things (at least biochemically), but other (e.g., Near Eastern) populations have different selected alleles or functionally relevant loci which result in no great selection on the ADH1B allele in question.
