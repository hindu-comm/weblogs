Height and health

[Height, health, and development](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/104/33/13232?rss=1):

From what I recall in modern countries height is about 80% heritable (the proportion of within population variation is controlled by genes). Obviously this is probably going to be lower in less developed nations.

Related: An [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/12/AR2007081200809_pf.html) in The Washington Post talking about the [tall Dutch again](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&domains=gnxp.com&q=Dutch+height+tallest&btnG=Search&sitesearch=gnxp.com). Has anyone thought to check the height in the Dutch areas of southwest Michigan? Whites seem smaller in many east coast or southern cities than in the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Boston and New Orleans). I assume my perception has to do with the ethnic mix, since the Pacific Northwest has fewer “ethnic” whites than other parts of the country, and a disproportionate number of the ethnics are Scandinavian (“everyone in Ballard is Norwegian”).
