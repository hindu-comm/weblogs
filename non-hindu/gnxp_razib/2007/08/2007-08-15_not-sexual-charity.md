Not sexual charity

Remember the [post](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article2237940.ece) [Sexual Charity](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article2237940.ece)? This is not sexual charity, [Grooming of white girls for sex is exposed as two Asian men jailed](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article2237940.ece). The root:

> “At the point in their lives when they are ready for this sort of > activity, Asians cannot go to Asian girls because it would be a > terrible breach of the honour of the community and their family to > have sex with an Asian girl before marriage.” She said that the reason > Asian men targeted very young white girls was because older white girls knew that a relationship with an Asian youth was unlikely to last as the community would seek an arranged marriage with someone from the Asian sub- continent…. >
> However, Ms Cryer added: “I think there is a problem with the view Asian men generally have about white women. Their view about white women is generally fairly low. They do not seem to understand that there are white girls as moral and as good as Asian girls.” >
> \[Asian means Muslim here\]

“Moral” is a loaded term. Are you less “moral” if you have 3 or 4 relationships before marriage and sexual relations with those individuals? What about if you are a virgin before marriage, but you don’t see the person you are going to have sex with for the first time until a few days before you marry them? There is some talk that in the United States candor has made the perfect the enemy of the good, that a little bit of hypocrisy is necessary and beneficial. But then you see the other extreme.

Of course this isn’t restricted to Muslims or “traditional” cultures. Most readers know that my adolescence was spent around many Mormons, and what passes for a socially conservative milieu in the United States. A particular subset of Mormon males, generally popular jocks, would date non-Mormon girls pretty explicitly for the purposes of sexual gratification. These men would subsequently go on to marry “good” Mormon girls. One of my friends told me quite frankly that he broke up with his Mormon girlfriend and dated a non-Mormon because he was so frustrated with having his sexual urges so constrained. After he got what he wanted he went back to his Mormon girlfriend (last I heard they were married and had several children). I’m assuming things would have been a little less relieved in Provo where everyone is a “good” girl….
