Really recent human evolution

The settlement of the New World in the Iberian colonies is characterized by two broad dynamics. First, the mass die offs of many populations due to the introduction of Eurasian pathogens. Second, the hybridization of indigenous female lineages with European male ones (and later African ones). Until recently it was assumed that the Puerto Rican population was dihybrid, that is, Africans and Europeans. But [new data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11512677&dopt=Citation) suggests a substantial indigenous maternal contribution.
