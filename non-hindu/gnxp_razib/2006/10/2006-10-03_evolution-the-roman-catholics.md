Evolution & the Roman Catholics

Two Catholic pubications touch upon evolution, first, [Commonweal](http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/article.php3?id_article=1749) [reviews](http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006d/100606/ss100606b.htm) [kenotic theology](http://www.mbrem.com/jesus_Christ/keno.htm), which seems to be entail (or at least align with) the necessity of evolution. I’m skeptical obviously, not being a believer, but it is an interesting idea and perhaps it will be attractive to some philosophically sophisticated believers (like [panentheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism)). Second, [The National Catholic Reporter](http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006d/100606/ss100606b.htm) [reviews](http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006d/100606/ss100606b.htm) [The Language of God](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLanguage-God-Scientist-Presents-Evidence%2Fdp%2F0743286391%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1159850195%2Fref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=geneexpressio-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1) by Francis Collins. This caught my attention:

> As an alternative to creationism and intelligent design, Dr. Collins > endorses the theory of theistic evolution, which accepts Darwin’s > findings while positing that humans are “unique in ways that defy evolutionary explanation and point to our spiritual nature.” **As evidence, he cites the existence of a universal moral law and an intuitive search for God throughout history**.

Collins should read [Breaking the Spell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreaking-Spell-Religion-Natural-Phenomenon%2Fdp%2F067003472X%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1159850277%2Fref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=geneexpressio-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1) or [The Moral Sense](https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMORAL-SENSE-James-Q-Wilson%2Fdp%2F0684833328%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1159850311%2Fref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=geneexpressio-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=geneexpressio-20&l=ur2&o=1). It seems to me that Collins’ epiphany is the true root of his faith, and all this argumentation is so *post facto* and *ad hoc*. But hey, food for thought….
