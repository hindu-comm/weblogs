Neandertal genome sequencing

[Afarensis](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/) points me to this [new story](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061026-neanderthals.html) in [National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061026-neanderthals.html) about the Neandertal sequencing effort:

> A new study by geneticist James Noonan at Lawrence Berkeley National > Laboratory, however, reveals that modern humans and Neandertals’ most > recent common ancestor probably perished about 400,000 years ago.  
> …  
> Noonan’s work represents a significant advance over earlier studies of > Neandertal genetics, such as those conducted by William Goodwin of the > University of Glasgow in Scotland…. >
> That early work involved analysis of mitochondrial DNA, which tends to > stay preserved longer than DNA found inside the nuclei of cells. But > Noonan analyzed nuclear DNA, which holds a much greater wealth of > information.  
> …  
> Based on his results to date, Paabo expects to see some surprises as > his project proceeds. >
> “Neandertal DNA is degraded in specific ways that we had not > anticipated, and in some ways Neandertals actually look closer to > humans than we had expected,” he said.

What could Paabo mean??? Stay tuned over the next few weeks….
