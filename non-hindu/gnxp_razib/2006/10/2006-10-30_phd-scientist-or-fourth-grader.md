PhD scientist or fourth-grader?

The [paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7069/full/nature04338.html) describing the sequence and analysis of the dog genome ends thusly:

> For millennia, dogs have accompanied humans on their travels. It is > only fitting that the dog should also be a valued companion on our > journeys of scientific discovery.

The lamest line in a scientific paper ever?
