John Maynard Smith

One of the things I regret during my tenure blogging is that I started doing “10 questions” too late to get in touch with [John Maynard Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_maynard_smith). If you haven’t, I highly recommend [this interview](http://meaningoflife.tv/video.php?speaker=maynard%20smith&topic=complete) by Robert Wright from a few years ago. Also, Smith wrote one of the more readable [introductory texts](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20/) on [Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20/), as well as pioneering the use of [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_maynard_smith#Evolution_and_the_Theory_of_Games) in evolutionary biology, introducing the concept of the [ESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy).
