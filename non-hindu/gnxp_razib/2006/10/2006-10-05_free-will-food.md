Free will & food

*Radio Open Source* [had a show](http://www.radioopensource.org/the-end-of-free-will/) on about “free will” with a foody focus inspired by Clay Shirky’s [*Edge* response](http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_2.html#shirky), “Free will is going away. Time to redesign society to take that into account.” [Megan McAardle](http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009489.html) offers a good skeptical and rational rebuttal to the emotive talking points spouted by some of the guests, nevertheless, I do think that libertarians (and I still consider myself one) must face up to the reality that advances in the *science of the mind* inevitably lead to “applications” which manipulate our mental architecture with greater precision and prediction than anything imagined by John Stuart Mill. I think in this case formally rigorous and empirically grounded models must cede **ultimate** ground to the common values espoused by a society. Shit, the libertarian SS will have their long knives out just for the last sentence. Oh, and **they quote me 3/4 of the way into the show**, just so you know.
