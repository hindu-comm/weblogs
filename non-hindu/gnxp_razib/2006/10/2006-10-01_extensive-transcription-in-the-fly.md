Extensive transcription in the fly

From a whole-genome tiling array [study of transcription in Drosophila](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n10/abs/ng1875.html):

> Many animal and plant genomes are transcribed much more extensively > than current annotations predict. However, the biological function of > these unannotated transcribed regions is largely unknown. > Approximately 7% and 23% of the detected transcribed nucleotides > during D. melanogaster embryogenesis map to unannotated intergenic and > intronic regions, respectively. Based on computational analysis of > coordinated transcription, **we conservatively estimate that 29% of > all unannotated transcribed sequences function as missed or > alternative exons of well-characterized protein-coding genes**. We > estimate that 15.6% of intergenic transcribed regions function as > missed or alternative transcription start sites (TSS) used by 11.4% of > the expressed protein-coding genes. Identification of P element > mutations within or near newly identified 5′ exons provides a strategy > for mapping previously uncharacterized mutations to their respective genes. Collectively, these data indicate that **at least 85% of the fly genome is transcribed and processed into mature transcripts representing at least 30% of the fly genome**.

The annotation of the human genome is probably not as good as in the fly, so the amount of unannotated genic regions is likely to be much higher.
