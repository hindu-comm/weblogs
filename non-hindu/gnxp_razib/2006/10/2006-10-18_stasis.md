Stasis

A lot of people seem to have the idea that significant human biological evolution stopped when we became behaviorally modern. Iâ€™m wondering just how they got that idea. Can anyone give me some examples of influential instances of this claim? Influential papers, texts, popular books, bubble gum wrappers, etc etc
