Il Principe as a evolutionary force

[The dynamics of Machiavellian intelligence](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0601428103v1?etoc). Abstract:

> The “Machiavellian intelligence” hypothesis (or the “social brain” > hypothesis) posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive > abilities of humans have evolved via intense social competition in > which social competitors developed increasingly sophisticated > “Machiavellian” strategies as a means to achieve higher social and > reproductive success. Here we build a mathematical model aiming to > explore this hypothesis. In the model, genes control brains which > invent and learn strategies (memes) which are used by males to gain > advantage in competition for mates. We show that the dynamics of > intelligence has three distinct phases. During the dormant phase only > newly invented memes are present in the population. During the > cognitive explosion phase the populationâ€™s meme count and the > learning ability, cerebral capacity (controlling the number of > different memes that the brain can learn and use), and Machiavellian > fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion. During the > saturation phase natural selection resulting from the costs of having > large brains checks further increases in cognitive abilities. Overall, > our results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the “Machiavellian > intelligence” hypothesis can indeed result in the evolution of > significant cognitive abilities on the time scale of 10 to 20 thousand > generations. We show that cerebral capacity evolves faster and to a > larger degree than learning ability. Our model suggests that there may > be a tendency toward a reduction in cognitive abilities (driven by the > costs of having a large brain) as the reproductive advantage of having > a large brain decreases and the exposure to memes increases in modern > societies.
