What shade do you fancy?

[![alba.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/10/alba.jpg?resize=275%2C516)![alba.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/10/alba.jpg?resize=275%2C516)](https://i0.wp.com/www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/2006-04/05/xin_47040305144738612991.jpg)[Via The American Scene](http://theamericanscene.com/), [Skin Color and Wages Among New Immigrants](http://client.norc.org/jole/SOLEweb/Hersch.pdf) (**Update:** Steve Sailer an interesting critique of this study). The basic finding is that controlling for all variables that they could nail down darker skinned immigrants tend to make less bank. As someone of luscious brownitude (see picture to your far left) this does concern me, but mom always told me that true *Übermenschen* always have their burdens. In other, somewhat related news, [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/10/skin-tone-and-attractiveness.html) [reports](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/10/skin-tone-and-attractiveness.html) on an interesting finding that in regards to [skin tone](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/10/skin-tone-and-attractiveness.html) a lighter shade of brown is oh so sexy baby, more so than black berry or pink peach. You didn’t need to convince me, we’re talking mid-20s on the [von Luschan scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Luschan_scale) baby.
