The hotspot paradox

In the comments of a [previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/what-drives-accelerated-molecular.php), rikurzhen asks the following question:

> do we know enough about recombination hot spots to say if they are heritable? if so, could the location of a hot spot itself be under selection?

I responded that it would be tough to tell whether or not hotspots are heritable or not, but this isn’t entirely true– I limited myself to thinking about humans. On a bit of further reading, I can now definitively say yes, certain DNA sequences are more likely than others to initiate recombination, and these sequences are (obviously) heritable.

The interesting thing is that the very existence of hotspots implies a paradox. I highly recommend the introduction to [this article](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/169/4/2319) for those looking to understand why this is so. Here’s a good summary of the problem:

Over many generations this self-destructive mechanism is expected to cause all active hotspot alleles to be replaced by alleles incapable of initiating DSBs**. The paradox is that this has not happened.

However, the story may be more complicated, at least in humans. From [here](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/9/1401):

> Haplotype analysis around both hotspots identified active and suppressed men sharing identical haplotypes, establishing that **these major variations in the presence/absence of a hotspot and in quantitative activity are not caused by local DNA sequence variation**

It seems likely, to me, that there must be some mechanism that maintains a certain number of recombination events on a chromosome (recall from your molecular biology class that at least one crossing-over *must* occur on each chromosome in meiosis I to guarantee proper segregation of the chromosomes). The actual location of the crossing-over may be determined by a number of factors, local sequence variation included. Perhaps this recombination-guaranteeing system, which itself is not part of the crossing-over, could resolve the paradox.
