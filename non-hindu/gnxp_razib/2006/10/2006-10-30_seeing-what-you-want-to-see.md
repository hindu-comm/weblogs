Seeing what you want to see….

[See What You Want to See: Motivational Influences on Visual Perception](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X01-4M6RX8X-3&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2006&_alid=476842318&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=7201&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4852321&md5=81c83fe96bae2049a3de177b3f6ba736):

Why does this matter? People see what they want to see, and their logic leads them to what they want them to see. Thank god natural science has reality!
