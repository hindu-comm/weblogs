Rod Dreher leaves Catholicism for Orthodoxy

Rod Dreher has a [long piece](http://www.beliefnet.com/blogs/crunchycon/2006/05/orthodoxy-and-me.html) about how and why he left Roman Catholicism for Orthodoxy. As an observer of religion as a natural phenomenon I was fascinated by the various parameters which compelled him to make such a drastic change. Keeping in mind what I’ve said about theology in the past, I was particularly interested by this:

> I had to admit that I had never seriously considered the case for > Orthodoxy. Now I had to do that. And it was difficult poring through > the arguments about papal primacy. I’ll spare you the details, but I > will say that I came to seriously doubt Rome’s claims. Reading the > accounts of the First Vatican Council, and how they arrived at the > dogma of papal infallibility, was a shock to me: I realized that I > simply couldn’t believe the doctrine. And if that falls, it all falls. > Of course I immediately set upon myself, doubting my thinking because > doubting my motives. You’re just trying to talk yourself into > something, I thought. And truth to tell, there was a lot of that, I’m > sure.

I tend to be of the opinion that intelligent believers accept the *reasons* to believe because they already believe. Faith makes reason compelling, reason does not lead to faith.
