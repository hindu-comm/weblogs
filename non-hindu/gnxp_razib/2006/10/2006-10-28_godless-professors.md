Godless professors?

There is a [working paper](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/gross/religions.pdf) out which reports on the nature of the religiousness of the professoriate. Some data of interest….  
\* Proportion of professors with “No religion” – 31% (vs. \~10% for the general public)  
“I don’t believe in God” – 10% (vs. 2.8% for the general public)  
“I don’t know whether there is a God, and I don’t believe there is a way to find out” – 13.4% (vs. 4.1% for the general public)  
“I don’t believe in a personal God, but I do believe in a Higher Power of some kind” – 19.6%  
“I find myself believing in God some of the time, but not at others” – 4.4%  
“While I have my doubts, I feel that I do believe in God” – 16.9%  
“I know God really exists and I have no doubts about it” – 35.7%

  
Proportion of “atheists and agnostics” (first two categories above)  
Elite doctorate granting institution – 36.6%  
BA granting institution – 22.7%  
Community College – 15.2%  
Psychology – 61%  
Biology – 61  
Mechanical Engineering – 50%  
Economics – 40%  
Political Science – 40%  
Computer Science – 40%  
Proportion exhibiting “No doubt that God exists”  
Accounting – 63%  
Elementary Education – 56.8%  
Finance – 48.6%  
Marketing – 46.5%  
Art – 46.2%  
Criminal Justic – 46.2%  
Nursing – 44%  
Views on the Bible….  
“Actual Word of God” 6.1%  
“Ancient book of fables, legends, history and moral precepts” 51.6%  
“Inspirted word of god” 42%  
**Major caveat, the author makes it clear that the disciplinary results are probably biased by the type of institution. For example, it seems plausible that a Community College is more likely to have members on the faculty in Art, Accounting or Finance than Mechanical Engineering.**  
One interesting finding is that though theism is alive and well in the professoriate, literalism is very weak. This goes toward one contention which I have made several times: the bias for supernaturalism, and religion in general, is far stronger than a bias for literalism or a particular specific religious orientation.
