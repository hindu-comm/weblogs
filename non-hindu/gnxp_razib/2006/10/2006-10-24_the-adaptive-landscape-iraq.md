The adaptive landscape & Iraq

[Salamander Candy](http://www.salamander-candy.com/2006/10/a_sorely_needed_map_of_iraq_as.htm) has a [post](http://www.salamander-candy.com/2006/10/a_sorely_needed_map_of_iraq_as.htm) attempting to use the heuristic of the adaptive landscape in relation to Iraq and its political organization. These analogies of course have resonance in direct proportion to familiarity. Myself, I tend to imagine sociological systems like the [boat vs. chair conformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_conformation).
