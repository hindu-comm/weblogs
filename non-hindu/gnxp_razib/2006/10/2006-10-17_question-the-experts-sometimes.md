Question the “experts” sometimes….

[This is the shape of things to come for mankind](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/17/nfuture17.xml) is an article which claims that “Variations in skin colouring are expected to be smoothed out, **with most humans moving towards a brown tone**.” The source of this is an evolutionary psychologist, [Dr. Oliver Curry](http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/darwin/publications/further.htm#oc), but, it seems to me that Dr. Curry is passing off what he read in science fiction as science. **Genetics is *not* blending**. I have posted on skin color enough to make clear why humans won’t turn uniformly as beautifully brown as some privileged people! A small number of loci (4-5) control skin color variation, and though random mating can reduce the multi-modality (so “peaks” of light and dark skin may diminish) the variation will be maintained beacuse genetic information is not destroyed, and the alleles which result in dark and light skin will still remain extant in the genetic background. So perhaps all the rest about 6′ 6″ males and mega-cocks might be viewed with some caution (correlated response anyone?).  
**Update:** Wilkins offers his [Australian dollar](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/the_nonesense_claim_about_huma.php) (i.e., 2 American cents).
