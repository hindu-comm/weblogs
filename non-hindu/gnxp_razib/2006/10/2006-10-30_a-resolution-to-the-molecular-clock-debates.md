A resolution to the molecular clock debates?

[Heterogeneous Genomic Molecular Clocks in Primates](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020163):

The authors’ results have direct implications on phylogenetic analyses, estimation of species divergence dates, and studies of the mechanisms and processes of evolution, where molecular clocks are imperative.

I really don’t have much to add, their own summary covers all the bases. Molecular clocks are critical in reconstructing phylogenies, and in human evolution their utility is so great that they have arguably revolutionized paleoanthropology. Obviously the great “rate debate” within phylogenetics matters here, as a million years here and there is essential in framing and generating hypotheses about the environment in which our hominid ancestors evolved and speciated.
