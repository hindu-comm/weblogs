Rate of molecular evolution

JP at my other blog has [two](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/what-drives-accelerated-molecular.php) [posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/at-gc-mutations-recombination-and.php) on molecular evolution worth checking out (the second post was inspired by a comment from [RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/)).
