Stuff that influences subjective well-being

I always say I don’t want to have kids because I don’t want that much an anchor keeping me from doing important things, and I don’t want my significant other’s attention drawn away. Plus, I’m giving the finger to those genes for trying to manipulate me. I was arguing with my friend about whether this was rational as far as life satisfaction. Looking for data to shore my side up I found a report ([pdf](http://melbourneinstitute.com/hilda/Biblio/cp/conf-p01.pdf#search=%22%22subjective%20well-being%22%20children%22)) about Marriage, Children, and Subjective Well-being. I’m not sure my side got shored, but it’s interesting data:

> Thus we find that:  
> (i) age exhibits the U-shaped relationship with life satisfaction found in multivariate  
> research employing large samples (with life satisfaction lowest at around 44 years  
> for men and 42 years for women);  
> (ii) life satisfaction is lowest for persons from a non-English speaking background,  
> especially women, and especially if their English language speaking ability is poor;  
> (iii) the effects of education on life satisfaction, while relatively small, are negative,  
> possibly the result of high aspirations that have yet to be met (Clark and Oswald  
> 1994);  
> (iv) levels of life satisfaction are strongly affected by the presence of health conditions  
> and disabilities that limit activity;  
> (v) persons not in employment but who are actively looking for work (that is, the  
> unemployed) express the highest levels of dissatisfaction, while the most satisfied  
> are persons who are neither employed nor looking for work (so long as this  
> situation is not the result of poor health);  
> (vi) the presence of persons other than immediate family members in the household has  
> predictable effects, with children enhancing satisfaction of men but reducing it for  
> women, and adults enhancing satisfaction of women but not men;  
> (vii) satisfaction levels rise with household income per head, though the magnitudes of  
> the estimated coefficients suggest that the effect is relatively small and that very  
> large increases in income are required to raise life satisfaction scores by even one  
> point on the scale;  
> (viii) homeowners tend to be more satisfied with their lives than renters;  
> (ix) religion tends to be an influence that enhances life satisfaction;  
> (x) persons who are more forward looking in their financial planning and savings  
> behaviour are more satisfied, though the effect is only pronounced among women;  
> and  
> (xi) more stable home environments when young (as represented by living with two  
> parents at age 14) are associated with greater levels of life satisfaction.

> SUMMARY  
> â€¢ Couples are, on average, much more satisfied with their lives than single persons.  
> â€¢ Any difference in life satisfaction between married couples and cohabiting  
> couples is small and confined to long-standing relationships.  
> â€¢ Differences in life satisfaction between formerly married persons and other single  
> persons are only marked for women, and even then the reported life satisfaction  
> scores of most of these women have almost completely recovered to the level of  
> other single women by the time divorce is finalized.  
> â€¢ Remarriage appears to benefit men more than women, with the life satisfaction of  
> married men rising with each subsequent marriage. In contrast, women are no  
> more (or less) happy in a second marriage.  
> â€¢ Life satisfaction declines with the number of dependent children living at home  
> but rises with the number of adult children who have left home.  
> â€¢ Dependent children who live elsewhere have a depressing effect on life  
> satisfaction (though large standard errors mean relatively little confidence can be  
> attached to this result).  
> â€¢ The negative effects of young dependent children are very large for single parents  
> but non-existent for married mothers.
