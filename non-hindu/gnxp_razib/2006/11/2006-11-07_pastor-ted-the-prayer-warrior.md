Pastor Ted the prayer warrior

Here is a [radio documentary](http://www.theamericaproject.org/?doc=pray) about the “prayer warriors” of Pastor Ted from 1997. I recall listening to this and finding it a bit peculiar at the time (and being disgusted by the documentarian’s attraction to what seems like a cult, but hey, sheep are sheep, without them Ubermensch would have no raw material).
