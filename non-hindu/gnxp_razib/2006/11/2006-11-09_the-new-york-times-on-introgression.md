The New York Times on introgression

The paper of record [reports on introgression](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/science/09gene.html?ref=us). Here is a tantalizing tidbit:

> **Two other reports of DNA studies** of possible mixing of human and > related genes are expected to be published in the next few weeks.

…I have suspicions, but I’m in the dark, so I’ll be checking in on [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/) regularly via my rss feed just like you. I am a little disappointed that Nick Wade didn’t tackle this, but perhaps he is busy writing copy for the other “Big Idea” that Hawks and Cochran have brewing….  
**Related:** I’m starting to be convinced by readers that the “Living Neandertals” that Hawks and Cochran have been talking about are situated on the [Celtic Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_fringe).
