States of Islam

“Ali Eteraz” has started a new site, [States of Islam](http://eteraz.org/). My friend [Aziz Poonawalla](https://cityofbrass.blogspot.com/) has a [post](http://eteraz.org/story/2006/11/16/6118/6888) up offering his thoughts on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I am aware of two of the headline contributors, Haroon Moghul and Thabet. Though I disagree with them, they’re both smart, so I indulge them in their error. Being a SCOOP based site I’ve set up an account and might post a diary or two flagrantly exhibiting my [ridda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridda). I hope Ali indulges me.
