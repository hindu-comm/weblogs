Dawkins on In Our Time

Richard Dawkins will be on [In Our Time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml) to discuss the evolutionary origins of [altruism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml). They are pretty good about getting the archive up in a day or so. Interesting that they illustrate the idea with Mr. *a priori* Kant, or am I being pretentious and misunderstanding Kant? I simply suspect that Dawkins will argue and elucidate an evolutionarily beneficial situationalism.
