You’re either with us, or against us….

How has your post-T-day been if you are a citizen of the Greatest Nation in the World?^(TM) Wow, I woke up this morning to a flare up in the Ed vs. PZ battle here on *SB* and elsewhere. [Bora](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/11/i_like_mms.php) has the most [most thorough](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/11/i_like_mms.php) round up of links, which can be reduced to theistic-evolutionists-are-sell-outs vs. theistic-evolutionists-are-OK-by-me. In many ways I do probably agree with Bora’s perspective on this issue, **there are a multiplicity of strategies, and different groups need to approach them from different angles**. Of course, being a pragmatic libertarian conservative, I don’t feel that Creationism is necessarily a symptom of “Conservative Pathology.” I’ve already noted that the link between being an anti-evolutionist and on the Right are weak in Europe, and men like William Jennings Bryan were certainly not conservatives in their day. In regards to the “root causes” of Creationism I think there is a mix of innate psychology and historical contingency. I am averse to accepting a Dawkins-style model which reduces Creationism to a subset of the religion “problem.”  
At the end of the day, this all a bunch of words. Yes, it can cause some temporary ill-feeling, but the fight goes on, and there is science to be done. On a personal level my own atheism has minimal affect on my relationships with Christians, like [Christer Chris](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/). Let a thousand flowers bloom, from PZ level anti-theism to Brayton style respect for theism to Ken Miller out & out theism.  
**PS:** Though the nastiness is pretty regrettable, at the end of the day we’re all worm-food.  
*Zechariah 13:7 – Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.*
