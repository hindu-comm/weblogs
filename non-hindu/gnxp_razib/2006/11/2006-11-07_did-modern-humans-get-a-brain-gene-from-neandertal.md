Did Modern Humans Get a Brain Gene from Neandertals?

**Update II:** Follow up post. You *really* should read [Greg](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/neanderthal-introgression.php) and [John](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/introgression_faq_2006.html) [Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/evans_introgression_2006.html), seeing as how they have a paper in the pipeline on this topic which is stepping off from where Lahn et. al. left off.  
**Update:** [Greg](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/neanderthal-introgression.php) and [John](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/introgression_faq_2006.html) [Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/evans_introgression_2006.html) have much more must read stuff!  
[Read about it here](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/1106/1?rss=1). Here is the paper, [Evidence that the adaptive allele of the brain size gene microcephalin **introgressed** into Homo sapiens from an archaic Homo lineage](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0606966103v1):

> At the center of the debate on the emergence of modern humans and > their spread throughout the globe is the question of whether archaic > Homo lineages contributed to the modern human gene pool, and more > importantly, whether such contributions impacted the evolutionary > adaptation of our species. A major obstacle to answering this question > is that low levels of admixture with archaic lineages are not expected > to leave extensive traces in the modern human gene pool because of > genetic drift. Loci that have undergone strong positive selection, > however, offer a unique opportunity to identify low-level admixture > with archaic lineages, provided that the introgressed archaic allele > has risen to high frequency under positive selection.

Furthermore, it > buttresses the important notion that, through such adminture, our > species has benefited evolutionarily by gaining new advantageous alleles. The interhaplogroup divergence test developed here may be broadly applicable to the detection of introgression at other loci in the human genome or in genomes of other species.

The full paper is **free**. Read it bitches. More to come soonâ€¦. (commentary, plus papers)  
Fuck the election! ðŸ™‚

**Update by Darth Quixote:** The D haplogroup is the same version of *MCPH1* that has nearly fixed in many human populations outside of sub-Saharan Africa, as reported at Gene Expression last year ([Bruce Lahnâ€™s brain on *ASPM* and *MCPH1*](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/this-is-bruce-lahns-brain-on-aspm-and.php)). Here is the Cliffs Notes part of the new paperâ€™s Discussion:

> In this study, we investigate the origin of the *microcephalin* D > allele in modern humans. We show that the D allele is unlikely to have > arisen within a panmictic population. Instead, our data are consistent > with a model of population subdivision followed by introgression to > account for the origin of the D allele. By this model â€¦ the lineage > leading to modern humans was split from another *Homo* lineage, and > the two lineages remained in reproductive isolation for \~1,100,000 > years. During this period of reproductive isolation, the modern human > lineage was fixed for the non-D allele at the *microcephalin* locus, > whereas the other *Homo* lineage was fixed for the D allele. **These > two alleles are differentiated by a large number of sequence > differences accumulated during the prolonged isolation of the two > populations.** At or sometime before \~37,000 years ago, a (possibly > rare) interbreeding event occurred between the two lineages, bringing > a copy of the D allele into anatomically modern humans. Whereas the > original D-bearing *Homo* population has since gone extinct, **this introgressed copy of the D allele in humans has subsequently spread to exceptionally high frequency throughout much of the world because of positive selection.**
