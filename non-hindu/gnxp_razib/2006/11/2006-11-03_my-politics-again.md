My politics, again

This [Moral Politics](http://www.moral-politics.com/) quiz said I was a [progressive liberal](http://www.moral-politics.com/xpolitics.aspx?menu=Political_Variations&action=Draw&choice=PoliticalVariations.Moderate_Liberalism). I wasn’t happy with that result, so I retook the [Politopia](http://www.politopia.com/) test which tagged me as a a “centrist.” I wanted to look for a test which would label me as a libertarian, but I’m tired, so another time….
