Correlated response?

![yglesias.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/yglesias.jpg?resize=375%2C160)![yglesias.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/yglesias.jpg?resize=375%2C160)I was surprised to see Matt Yglesis on [Bloggingheads.tv](http://bloggingheads.tv/) today, arguing with Ross Douthatâ€¦he seems shockingly elfin in his countenance compared to his normal appearance. And interestingly, his voice is far more masculine! I wonder if this is some form of [correlated response](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=correlated+response&btnG=Google+Search) on the scale of ontogeny?
