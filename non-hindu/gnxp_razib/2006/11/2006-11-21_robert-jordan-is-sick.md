Robert Jordan is sick

When I was a kid, back in the day, I read up to book 6 of [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_wheel_of_time). It seemed that after book 3 the series went into an [exponential decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay) of quality…and I couldn’t handle the flat female characters and I ditched in book 6. Well, turns out that he’s churned out 11 books total. A friend of mine once joked about “Egwene’s Paradox,” which was a variant of Zeno’s Paradox. Basically, one of the main characters (Egwene) had a destination, and as she proceeded her velocity dropped in every single book so that she would never reach the terminus. Well, I hear she did reach her goal, though I also read one book followed only **one day!**  
Anyway, so the main point here is that Jordan was diagnosed with a heart condition. The median life expectancy is 4 years. He’s working on the concluding book to his saga. Who would have thought it ended like this?
