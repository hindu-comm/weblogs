Charlie Rose on the brain

[Video](https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6492494150503430511)

Interesting bits:  
1. Rose asks about geographical/population differences in brain structure/function — maybe Jim Watson and E. O. Wilson rubbed off on him — but there were no takers. A follow up on sex differences gets a few answers, including the suggestion that lack of male plasticity after stroke could be a result of firmer specialization that would produce “faster” processing in some domains.  
2. The NIH scientist appears to mention the Turkheimer study on the heritability of IQ varying with SES but get the results backwards.
