Borat

Saw [Borat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borat) today. Funny, but too much fecal/toilet humor for my taste. I paid matinee price so I’m happy, would be a little let down if I’d gone full price. Also, from wiki:

> Parts of the film were filmed in Romania, not Kazakhstan, and some > characters purporting to speak Kazakh are really speaking Romanian. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen speaks Hebrew in the film (not Kazakh), while Ken Davitian, the actor who plays Azamat, speaks Armenian. They also use several sayings from Slavic languages, such as Polish or Czech.

That makes sense, the language seemed all over the place.

Derb [has some semi-spoilers](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDQ3ZjA3YmU0NDM5MzkwYzdkMmE3ZTEwZmU0NzQ2YzM=)…and I pretty much agree with him on the issues he brings up.
