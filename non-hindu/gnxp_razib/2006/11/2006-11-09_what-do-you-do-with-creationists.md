What do you do with Creationists?

Dean Esmay [graciously linked](http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1163098874.shtml) to our recent discussion of Neandertal introgression, and there was this [comment](http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1163098874.shtml#91655):

> I’m of the opinion that “Neanderthal,” as we know it, is the > scientific equivalent of smoke and mirrors designed for the expressed > purpose of supporting evolution. They’ve allowed the cart to pull the > horse. Evolution must be right therefore there must be evolutionary > stages. Since the former cannot ever be questioned anything coming > from it is simply fruit from the poisonous tree. >
> Unsurprisingly I take a Biblical approach. We see in the Bible that > man lived for hundreds of years….

Now, my own initial response was that this was a satirical comment, but subsequent comments and clarifications from regulars on Dean’s blog confirmed that this individual was a Creationist. Their argument **is rational, *assuming* Creationist priors**. Seeing as how a really cool evolutionary story just broke I really wasn’t going to waste my time arguing Creation vs. Evolution. When Creationists post on the weblogs I run or manage I simply delete their comments, I see no point in even insulting them or caling them out. There just isn’t a plausible way to bridge the discussion, and I’m interesting in *understanding* evolution, not debating whether gravity exists or not.

My question is for readers, and it is two fold:

1\) What do you do or say when confronted with Creationists? When I was younger I would debate and engage my peers who were Creationists (many of my friends), and at this point I’ve felt like I put in my dues. When someone expresses Creationist sentiments now I simply write them off and perform a silent intellectual *shiv’ah*.

2\) Nevertheless, I do feel it is important that some individuals do speak up on this topic. I applaud [Ken Miller](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-ken-miller.php) for taking the battle to the Creationists, **someone** has to do it. What’s the optimal strategy so that real science can continue without interruption?

**TangoMan adds:** This [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19225776.100?DCMP=NLC-nletter&nsref=mg19225776.100) article addresses the rise of a whole separate creationist educational system – here’s a scary quote:

> Home-school parents are able to teach their children this way thanks > mainly to a group called the Home School Legal Defense Association > (HSLDA), a non-profit organisation based in Purcellville – like > Patrick Henry College (PHC), which the HSLDA founded. . . . . >
> Now evangelical home-schoolers can also opt for a college like PHC. > The school was founded in 2000 to “prepare leaders who will fight for > the principles of liberty and our home-school freedoms through careers > of public service and cultural influence”. >
> It worked. By 2004, PHC students held seven out of 100 internships in > the White House, a number even more striking when one considers that > only 240 students were enrolled in the entire college. Last year, two > PHC graduates worked in the White House, six worked for members of > Congress and eight for federal agencies, including two for the FBI. > “Patrick Henry is something to worry about because these kids end up > in the administration,” says Glenn Branch, deputy director of the > National Center for Science Education in Oakland, California, which > campaigns against the teaching of creationism as science. >
> Home-schoolers are drawn to PHC partly because of its political > connections and partly because, unlike most Christian colleges, it > boasts high academic standards. Besides the focus on creationism, > **much of the curriculum is dedicated to rhetoric and debate, > preparing students to fight political and legal battles on issues such > as abortion, stem cell research and evolution.** The technique is > effective. For the past two years, the college has won the moot court > national championship, in which students prepare legal briefs and > deliver oral arguments to a hypothetical court, and has twice defeated > the UK’s University of Oxford in debating competitions.
