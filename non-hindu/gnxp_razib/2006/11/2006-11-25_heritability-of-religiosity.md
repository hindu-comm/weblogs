Heritability of religiosity

Below I made a reference to the heritability of religiosity. In a chat with [Christer Chris](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/) that the heritability for religiosity was 0.5, and he was surprised at the result. I decided to double-check, and here is the [latest paper](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x/abs/):

> Estimates of the degree of genetic and environmental influences on > religiousness have varied widely. This variation may, in part, be due > to age differences in the samples under study.

In Bouchard’s “twins raised apart” studies he found about a 0.5 heritability. In any case, remember what heritability is: **The proportion of population level variance attributable to genetic variance**. Why does environmental variance become so much less important once you leave adolescence? Take a guess….
