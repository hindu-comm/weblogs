Brother-sister differences in the g factor

In press at [*Intelligence*](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.003), from the redoubtable Ian Deary and his colleagues:

> There is scientific and popular dispute about whether there are sex > differences in cognitive abilities and whether they are relevant to > the proportions of men and women who attain high-level achievements, > such as Nobel Prizes. A recent meta-analysis (Lynn, R., and Irwing, P. > (2004). Sex differences on the progressive matrices: a meta-analysis. > Intelligence, 32, 481-498.), which suggested that males have higher > mean scores on the general factor in intelligence (g), proved > especially contentious. Here we use a novel design, **comparing 1292 > pairs of opposite-sex siblings** who participated in the US National > Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY1979). The mental test applied > was the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), from which > the briefer Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores can also be > derived. **Males have only a marginal advantage in mean levels of g > (less than 7% of a standard deviation) from the ASVAB and AFQT, but substantially greater variance. Among the top 2% AFQT scores, there were almost twice as many males as females.** These differences could provide a partial basis for sex differences in intellectual eminence.
