Brighter than Isaac Newton?

In his [presentation](http://beyondbelief2006.org/Watch/) for Beyond Belief 2006 [Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://sciencenet.vo.llnwd.net/o16/beyondbelief2006/Day%201/S2wBug-MPEG-4%20300Kbps%20Streaming.mp4) offered Isaac Newton as his candidate for the most brilliant intellectual ever. Because he is trained as a physicist Tyson can be accused of some bias, but the impact on him personally was pretty obvious, he was emotionally moved just comprehending Newtonâ€™s genius. Myself, I would tend to agree with Tyson though these things are always subject to the various weights on your parameters. Who would you offer up? Of the ancients I believe that Archimedes is likely to have been a magician in the mold of Newton. Here is what the great polymath J.M. Keynes had to say of Sir Isaac Newton:

> He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and > Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and > intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our > intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.
