"Wrong door" raids

[The Agitator](http://www.theagitator.com/) is doing a fine job on the play-by-play following the Kathryn Johnston shooting. These are your drug war tax dollars at work. For a weak-willed waffler like myself it is nice to come across a policy area where the side of reason and justice is so obvious. Rapidly approaching single issue voter status.

> By conservative estimates, there are about 110 of these types of raids > per day in America. The vast majority are for drug crimes. Think this > was the only one conducted after shoddy police work? Think this was > the only one conducted based solely on the word of an informant? Think > it’s pure coincidence that in the one raid that made national > attention last week, we now learn that something went severely wrong > in the investigation that led to it? >
> Of course not. This is standard operating procedure. This the way it’s > done in a huge number of jurisdictions across the country. Not all. > But far too many. I’ve had police officers tell me raids are never > launched based solely on the word of an informant. But this one was. > I’ve had police officers tell me there’s always extensive > corroborating investigation to verify the address, house, and suspect. > But not this time. I’ve had police officers tell me paramilitary raids > are only conducted with the suspect is extremely dangerous, and has a > history of violent behavior. Not this time. I’ve had police officers > tell me they only target big suppliers with these raids, not > small-time dealers or users. Again — that wasn’t the case, here. >
> I find it hard to believe that the only time time these shortcuts have > been used are in those raids we read about in the newspaper — where an > innocent person dies. >
> These assaults on people’s homes are high-stakes and have an extremely > thin margin for error. Couple that with the inherent shortcomings of > relying on shady informants — a critical tool in drug policing — and > you get a recipe for hundreds of innocent people wrongly terrorized, > and dozens more who end up dead. [By my > count](http://www.cato.org/raidmap/index.php?type=1), Kathryn Johnston > is number 41. Throw in [nonviolent > offenders](http://www.cato.org/raidmap/index.php?type=2) and she’s > number 61 — at least (I’m sure I haven’t found all of those cases). >
> And all of this — for what? >
> To stop people from getting high.
