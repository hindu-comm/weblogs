Yes, Virgina, there is a God. And he lives off the coast of New Jersey.

You know how little kids write letters to Santa, laying out their claims on His glorious, chimney-borne bounty? Isnâ€™t that just so god-damned cute? We pat them on their heads, smile and nod, and wink at the others in on the joke. But what happens when those kids grow up and [write letters to God](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/02/unanswered.prayers.ap/index.html)? Cute? Comical? Or just horribly depressing?
