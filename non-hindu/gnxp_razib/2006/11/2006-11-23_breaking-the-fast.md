Breaking the fast

Not a genetic story, but amusing (well, I thought so), this report from today’s London **Times**:

> A Muslim who killed a swan \[a protected species\] during Ramadan has > been given a two-month prison sentence. Shamsu Miah, 52, killed the > mute swan at a boating pond in Llandudno, North Wales, on September 25. When challenged by police he said: “I am a Muslim. I am fasting. I needed to eat.” Llandudno magistrates were told that Miah, from the town, had white feathers stuck in his beard and blood on his shirt.

Which raises the questions: did he actually eat it raw? And was this halal?
