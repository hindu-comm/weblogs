Ass-kicking is stochastic

Via [Kambiz](http://anthropology.net/user/kambiz_kamrani/blog/2006/11/22/genghis_khans_protein_boost_helped_conquer_the_world) I found [this post](http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/?p=307/trackback) which argues that the high-protein diet of the Mongols was important in allowing them to defeat their enemies, who were relatively nutritionally deficient. Perhaps. But history isn’t that simple, after all, if “more meat = more ass-kicking,” you wouldn’t have predicated that the grain-fed Roman soldiers would be able to cut a scythe through meat & milk gorging Celts and Germans, would you? How did those ancient Italians defeat the northerners? If you read about the suppression of the rebellion of [Boudicca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudicca) and how outnumbered Roman infantry formed a [testudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testudo_formation) simply turned into a Celtic meat grinder you’ll see that man can fight and win by bread and water alone!  
*Judges 9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.*
