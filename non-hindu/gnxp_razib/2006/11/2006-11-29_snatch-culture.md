Snatch culture

Yesterday there was an interview with an author of a book about the rise of “raunch culture” among today’s youth [on NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6549015). By coincidence yesterday was also the day that Britney Spears [flashed her beaver](http://thesuperficial.com/2006/11/britney_spears_really_wants_yo.html) to the world. Now, you might think that Spears isn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, that she couldn’t anticipate that running around without underwear, wearing a skirt, and mugging for the paparazzi, would inevitably lead to some labial exposure. Oops, [she did it again](http://thesuperficial.com/2006/11/britney_spears_shows_her_crotc.html)! [Cultural weapons of mass destruction](http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/003187.html) indeed. And I laughed when K-Fed asked for custody….
