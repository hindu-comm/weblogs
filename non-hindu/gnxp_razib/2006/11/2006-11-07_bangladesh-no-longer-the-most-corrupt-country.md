Bangladesh no longer the most corrupt country!

[Bangladesh is no longer the most corrupt country in the world!!!](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/cpi_2006/cpi_table). Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Guinea, **Iraq**, Myanmar and Haiti are tops. Boy, and I am proud to be an American, after all, we helped Iraq attain the status of being the 3rd most corrupt nation in the world! Seeing as how millions have died in the Congo since 1996, methinks we need another intervention, and perhaps we help Congo ascend the ranks a bit? Who knows, can’t you imagine a scenario 5 years down the road when Americans troops have to stand down and call off a search for their cannibalized comrades so that our puppet “president” could get some “creds” from the rebel leaders he had to placate?  
Also, here are the **least corrupt nations:**  
Finland  
Iceland  
New Zeland  
Denmark  
Singapore  
Sweden  
Switzerland  
Norway  
Australia  
The Netherlands  
Hm…me thinks there is a Eurocentric bias here, no? What must be white is right!
