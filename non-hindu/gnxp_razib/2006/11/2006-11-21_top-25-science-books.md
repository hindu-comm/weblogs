Top 25 science books

[Discover](http://www.discover.com/issues/dec-06/features/25-greatest-science-books/?page=1) is doing a “25 Greatest Science Books of All-Time” list. The great thing about stuff like this is it gets you thinking, talking, and exposes what your priorities are. There isn’t a canonical list with a clear rank order. I mean, yeah, *Principia* is the bomb, but people can make a case for *The Origin of Species*. Below is the list from *Discover*, and below the fold my quick & dirty re-order. Hope it tells you something about me.

  
1. and
2. The Voyage of the Beagle (1845) and The Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin \[tie\]  
3. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) by Isaac Newton (1687)

Caveat, I haven’t read all the books here, and a few I haven’t even heard of (e.g., ‘Under a Lucky Star’). My list is probably biased toward the books I have read.
