Mormons in The Corner

[David](http://www.rishon-rishon.com/) points out that they are talking about Mormons in *The Corner* today relating to Mitt Romney.  
[Jonah](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjJlYmQyMzcwN2Q0NmU4Y2VlY2YzYTlkMDZiNzM2MDc=) thinks that the Mormon thing might help  
[An evangelical](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDk2OTU2MGVjMGI1YmU5ZWNmYzQ1Y2ExYTA1ZGZiOTE=) who is married to a Mormon thinks that it isn’t a big issue

[A Mormon](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzE4YWVlZTI0NjAxZjU3YzVhM2M3OWFhZTIzNWJmMDg=) comments on the anti-Mormons

[Another Mormon emailer](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDBmZmFjYWJhYjI4ZjYxNmY1N2YxYWRkNmQ1MmQyZWU=)  
I posted something [very long](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/one-nation-under-gods-and-mitt-romney.php) on Mormons last year. I am skeptical that Romney can make it past the Republican primaries, because *ceteris paribus* he just can’t match up. I can’t believe that the Republicans can’t produce a convential Christian with Romney’s policy stands and competence. I won’t review the mismash with various issues relating to Mormonism, the main problem is that the religion was invented in the light of history, and its theology is very bizarre to most Christians.
