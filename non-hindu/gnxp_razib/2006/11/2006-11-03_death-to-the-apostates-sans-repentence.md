Death to the apostates! (sans repentence)

![salman.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/salman.jpg?resize=200%2C267)![salman.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2006/11/salman.jpg?resize=200%2C267)[Islam Online](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=islam+online&url=http://www.islam-online.net/english/index.shtml) is one of the top 1,000 sites on the net according to [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=islam+online&url=http://www.islam-online.net/english/index.shtml). Every Friday I will offer a “taste” of learned commentary from that website for your edification. Today, **apostates**, or [irtidad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam).

  
Dr. Yusuf Al-Qaradawi “is a world-renowned scholar and head of the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) and president of the International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS).” He has been involved in the [InterFaith Cultural Organization](http://www.interfaithathens.org/en/). Dr. Qaradawi says:

> The greatest kind of danger that faces Muslims is that which threatens > their moral aspect of existence, i.e., their belief. That is why > apostasy from Islam is regarded as one of the most dangerous threats > to the Muslim community. The ugliest intrigue the enemies of Islam > have plotted against Islam has been to try to lure its followers away > from it; they have even used force for this purpose.  
> …  
> **The third and most dangerous and cunning kind is the secular > invasion**, which still plays its role in the Muslim world, sometimes > openly, and sometimes in disguise. It seeks to undermine true Islam > and approves of the superstitious manifestations that are falsely > claimed to belong to Islam.  
> The duty of the Muslim community — in order to preserve its identity — > is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving > it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world.  
> ….  
> Muslims are to seriously resist individual apostasy before it > seriously intensifies and develops into a collective one.  
> That is why the Muslim jurists are unanimous that apostates must be > punished, yet they differ as to determining the kind of punishment to > be inflicted upon them. The majority of them, including the four main > schools of jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi\`i, and Hanbali) as > well as the other four schools of jurisprudence (the four Shiite > schools of Az-Zaidiyyah, Al-Ithna-\`ashriyyah, Al-Ja\`fariyyah, and > Az-Zaheriyyah) agree that **apostates must be *executed*.**  
> …  
> For example, Ibn \`Abbas quoted the Prophet (peace and blessings be > upon him) as having said, **“Whoever changes his religion, then kill > him.”**  
> …  
> Major apostasy, which the apostate proclaims and openly calls for in > speech or writing, is to be, with all the more reason, severely > punished by the death penalty, according to the majority of scholars > and the apparent meaning of the Prophet’s hadiths. Otherwise, > An-Nakh\`i and Ath-Thawri’s view which was built on \`Umar’s attitude > may be followed.  
> **Apostates who call for apostasy from Islam have not only become > disbelievers in Islam but have also become enemies of Islam and the > Muslim nation.** They, by doing so, fall under the category of those > who wage war against Almighty Allah and His Messenger and spread > mischief in the land.  
> ….  
> **The death penalty** with regard to apostasy is to be applied only to > those who proclaim their apostasy and call for others to do the same. > Islam lays down this severe punishment in order to protect its unity > and the identity of its community. Every community in this world has > basic foundations that are to be kept inviolable, such as identity, > loyalty, and allegiance. Accordingly, no community accepts that a > member thereof changes its identity or turns his or her loyalty to its > enemies. They consider betrayal of one’s country a serious crime, and > no one has ever called for giving people a right to change their > loyalty from a country to another whenever they like.  
> …  
> Some contemporary writers who are not versed in religious knowledge > object to the penalty of proclaimed apostasy being death by saying > that this penalty is not mentioned in the Qur’an. It is only mentioned > in a hadith ahad (hadith that is narrated by people whose number does > not reach that of the mutawatir, which is hadith that is narrated by > such a large number of people that they cannot be expected to agree > upon a lie, all of them together); and hadiths ahad, according to > them, are not taken as evidences for the legal punishments prescribed > by Shari\`ah.  
> But this objection is refutable in many aspects as follows. First, > according to the scholarly consensus, the authentic Sunnah is a source > for applied rulings in Shari\`ah. Almighty Allah says, \[Say: Obey > Allah and obey the Messenger.\] (An-Nur 24:54). He also says, \[Whoso > obeyeth the Messenger obeyeth Allah.\] (An-Nisaa’ 4:80)  
> **As for the hadiths specifying the death penalty for apostates, they > have been proven to be authentic.** Besides, they were put into effect > by the Companions in the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs.
