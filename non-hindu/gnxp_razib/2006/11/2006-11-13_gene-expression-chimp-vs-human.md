Gene expression, chimp vs. human

Some people say [human geneticists suck](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/11/human_geneticists_suck.php). On the other hand, check this out, [Conservation and evolution of gene coexpression networks in human and chimpanzee brains](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0605938103v1):

> Comparisons of gene expression between human and non-human primate > brains have identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes, yet > translating these lists into key functional distinctions between > species has proved difficult. Here we provide a more integrated view > of human brain evolution by examining the large-scale organization of > gene coexpression networks in human and chimpanzee brains. We identify > modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to discrete brain regions > and quantify their conservation between the species. Module conservation in cerebral cortex is significantly weaker than module conservation in subcortical brain regions, revealing a striking gradient that parallels known evolutionary hierarchies….
