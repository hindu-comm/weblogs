Memory enhancement by non-invasive electrical stimulation

[Nature reported](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature05278.html) and [Robert Stickgold](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature05309.html) commented on a study by Marshall et al. They trained folks to remember some wordpairs and then stuck electrodes on their scalp while they were sleeping. By providing rhythmic stimulation across the cortex they were able to increase the amount of time spent in a specific sleep stage: slow-wave sleep. You know some sleep stages, right? Like REM is the sleep stage where you’re dreaming and things like that. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM stage. The volunteers that received this stimulation remembered word pairs better than the ones who did not. Slow-wave sleep is especially interesting because a characteristic cortical rhythm called a “sleep spindle” can be recorded during that time, and other studies have shown that firing of hippocampal cells becomes coordinated with that of cortical cells during these patterns.

They ran lots of control memory tasks and found that the enhancement was specific for declarative memory (the wordpair test) as opposed to motor learning tasks. I might’ve like to see an attentional or working memory task on the second day to show that the sham-stimulated group weren’t just groggy or something.
