Israeli fertility: The importance of culture

Israel is the only country I know of where fertility increases as income goes up, among “normally” wealthy. (The super-rich might be another story, but they don’t have much of a statistical presence). From [here](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154526026305&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull):

> In virtually the entire modern world, increased wealth and education > are linked with plummeting birthrates. The New York Times reported > this week that Europe is “wrestling” with birthrates which have > “reached a historic and prolonged low… straining pension plans and > depleting the work force across the continent.” The EU projects a > shortfall of 20 million workers by 2030. In 1990, no European country > had a fertility rate of less than 1.3 children per woman; by 2002, 15 > countries did. The “birth dearth” has become a political issue in > Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic. “Almost all countries are > increasing baby bonuses,” the article reports. While the US fertility > rate currently hovers around the replacement level of 2.1, the rate > among American Jews is considerably lower: 1.86. >
> Israel is almost another world. The average fertility rate is 2.7 > children per woman – by far the highest of any modern democracy in the > world. Moreover, the average size of families with a high monthly > income – above NIS 50,000 – is 4.3 people, compared to 3.7 for > families with more modest salaries. >
> What’s going on here? >
> ACCORDING TO demographer Sergio DellaPergola, we are different than > Europe and America in our attitudes toward family size. “Here, people > would like to have three children at least.” If they don’t, it is > generally because of economic restraints, as demonstrated by the fact > that, in Israel, the upper-middle class is associated with more > children, not fewer.
