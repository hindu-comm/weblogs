Epistasis correlates with genomic complexity

From [PNAS:](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/103/39/14402)

> Simpler genomes, such as those of RNA viruses, display > [antagonistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis#Classification_by_fitness_or_trait_value) > [epistasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis) (mutations have > smaller effects together than expected); bacterial microorganisms do > not apparently deviate from independent effects, whereas in > multicellular eukaryotes, a transition toward > [synergistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis#Classification_by_fitness_or_trait_value) > epistasis occurs (mutations have larger effects together than > expected). We propose that antagonistic epistasis might be a property > of compact genomes with few nonpleiotropic biological functions, > whereas in complex genomes, synergism might emerge from mutational > robustness.

Some have argued that **synergistic epistasis** is the way that “sex pays off” for complex organisms. Sexual reproduction tends to break apart superfit correlations of alleles, but synergistic epistasis is a way to recoup this loss (and evade [Muller’s Ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet)).
