Finland & Himmler's scholars

In [The Master Plan: Himmler’s Scholars and the Holocaust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786868864//geneexpressio-20) the author claims that:

- The attempts by a Finnish anthropologist to assert that the Finns were
  an “Aryan” people was greeted with some hostility from his colleagues.
  There was a reference to Finns having their own ideas, but the
  footnote wasn’t clear and I don’t have time to track it down (and the
  cite is clear a German language publication). But, I wonder if part of
  the issue might be what Jaakkeli has spoken of in regards to Finnish
  ideas of hybrid vigor - He filmed Karelian illiterate magicians and witches and recorded their
  “spells.” It would be interesting to see this footage as
  the-European-as-primitive-savage would be a novelty. - One argument for the Finns’ Mongoloid/Asian origins was that their
  reserved and taciturn character was more Asiatic than European.
