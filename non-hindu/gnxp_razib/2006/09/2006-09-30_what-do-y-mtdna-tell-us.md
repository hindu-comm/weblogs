What do Y & mtDNA tell us?

[RPM has a post up](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/) about Y and mtDNA lineages, and what they can (or can’t) tell us about demographic history. I’m pretty skeptical myself about the broad and detailed deep time inferences some make with these markers (see [The Real Eve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786711922/geneexpressio-20/104-2524967-1227960) for an extreme case), but [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/09/male-and-female-genomic-contributions.html) points me [to a situation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?tmpl=NoSidebarfile&db=PubMed&cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=17006671&dopt=Abstract) where there is some utility to this methodology:

Similarly, Latin America shows strong signatures of asymmetrical gene flow in relation to the sexes. The key I think is that **genetic data is a supplement to what we already know, and refines and confirms our hypotheses**, the problem tends to be when genetic data is the sole leg upon which to stand, because as RPM notes assumptions of neutrality might not hold across the time spans and geographical distributions that we wish to survey.
