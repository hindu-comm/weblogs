There is nothing like data……

….to ruin a perfectly good theory. So says [Beth Visser](http://www.brocku.ca/psychology/graduate/visser.htm) and colleagues in the latest edition of [Intelligence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01602896). She tested [Gardner’s](http://www.pz.harvard.edu/PIs/HG.htm) theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI), gasp!, empirically. What did she find?

> Our analyses of tests measuring the “intelligences” of Gardner’s MI > theory revealed that many of those tests were substantially > intercorrelated, despite representing different domains of Gardner’s > framework, and also showed strong loadings on a g factor and strong correlations with an external test of general intelligence. **These results are difficult to reconcile with the core aspects of MI theory.**

More specifically, the researchers combed over quite a few tests to find two or three that match Gardner’s own explication of his intelligences. When they gave them to a group of college students, (surprise surprise) they all had a strong correlation with each other, except the tests that measured Bodily-Kinesthetic, Intrapersonal, and Musical “intelligence.” I don’t think anyone outside of Gardner and his sycophants think that tests that measure Bodily-Kinesthetic skills are actually a subset under intelligence. Likewise, Intrapersonal intelligence is little more than self-esteem/self-concept, which [we know doesn’t really predict anything](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/index.cfm?journal=pspi&content=pspi/4_1); the low musical correlations, however, were a bit of surprise (esp. given [Carroll’s](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Cognitive-Abilities-Factor-Analytic-Studies/dp/0521387124/sr=8-5/qid=1158977949/ref=sr_1_5/102-4306673-5474537?ie=UTF8&s=books) opus), but in all likelihood, this a solely a function of the tests horrible reliability.

What can we conclude? (a) sans physical ability and self-esteem, Gardner’s intelligence domains can best be thought of as second-stratum factors of Carroll’s hierarchy, (b) that being said, before any more time, effort, and energy is exerted in MI, Gardner or his colleagues need to provide “falsifiable, testable, MI-based hypotheses that would predict results different from those predicted by existing models of the structure of mental abilities,” and (c) any [educational curriculum](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=multiple+intelligence+curriculum) based on MI theory is, currently, a waste of teacher time and student energy.
