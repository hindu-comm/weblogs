GSS – POLIDEOFULL

From the GSS, POLIDEOFULL combines two markers (political affiation and self-description along a liberal-moderate-conservative axis) to form 21 categories. Here are the average WORDSUM scores for each group. The liberal-conservative axis has been color-coded from dark blue to dark red for each of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. Restricted to whites only. Here’s the data:

Obviously people who self-identify as extremely conservative Democrats or extremely liberal Republicans score poorly on WORDSUM. Liberal Dems, Liberal Indepedents, and Conservative Republicans socre better than average. Interestingly, Conservative Indepdents score lower.
