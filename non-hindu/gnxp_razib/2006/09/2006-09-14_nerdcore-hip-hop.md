Nerdcore Hip-Hop

Here is a [repository of links](http://www.bedoper.com/nerdcore/) to nerdy nerdy rapping. Seems like most of the expert nerdiness is computer-related. MC++ and Frontalot are probably the best known. Frontalot has a [recent incredibly nerdy take on Wagner](http://www.em411.com/show/release/631) in collaboration with Baddd Spellah (I suppose the track is attributed vice versa.)
