Nerd like me

Janet has [declared](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/09/its_a_nerdoff.php) a ‚ÄúNerd off.‚Äù Here are two tales which made me reflect upon my nerdiness.

1.  Once a friend and I mocked another friend because of their clumsy
    [pipetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipette) technique (he
    transferred volume like a *girl!* Oops, sorry Janet, that was a joke
    üôÇ 2.  In a linear algebra study session I once made a joke which conflated
    9-space with 3-space. Everyone laughed uproariously.
