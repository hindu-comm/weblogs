Rushton

J. Philippe Rushton has two new things of interest:

1\) A new [homepage](http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/JPRvitae.htm) with his full vita–with many of the newer articles being downloadable.

2\) A new [article](http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/psychology/faculty/rushtonpdfs/in%20press%20Intell.pdf)(co-authored with the late Douglas Jackson), showing pre-collegiate males are smarter (“have higher g”), at least as measured by the SAT, than females across ethnic groups and SES. This seems to hold for both SAT-Math and SAT-Verbal. Of note: a) the sample size is huge: 100,000 people; 2) males were “overrepresented” at the higher tails of the SAT/IQ distribution, females were “overrepresented” at the lower tails—but, of course, folks with Mental Retardation and Borderline Cognitive Functioning do not, in general, take the SAT, and since the sample used was the 1991 SAT “validity” folks, the lower tails of the SAT distribution should be around 90ish in a regular IQ distribution. Thus, what we have here, is some more evidence that males are more likely to be in the upper tails of the IQ distribution, while females are more likely to be in the center. This, then, averages to about a 3 IQ points advantage for males—a trend that others have also found ([e.g.,](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/sex-differences-in-mental-abilities_29.php))
