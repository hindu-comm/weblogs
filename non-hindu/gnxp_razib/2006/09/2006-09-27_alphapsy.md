AlphaPsy

Just a heads up, [a new blog](http://www.cognition.ens.fr/%7Ealphapsy/blog/) which addresses culture via a naturalistic lens is now up and running, [AlphaPsy](http://www.cognition.ens.fr/%7Ealphapsy/blog/). In the [Cavalli-Sforza 10 Q’s](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-luigi-luca-cavalli.php) he stated that cultural anthropology just isn’t scientific, and is positively hostile to science. This is a different direction, and very much a minority take, but good things start small.
