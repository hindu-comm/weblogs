Skin deep, why I’m brown and you wish you were

A year ago, Armand Leroi, the author of [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031100/geneexpressio-20/), [wrote](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/leroi05/leroi05_index.html):

Wonder no more Armand! Some have said we are in the [golden age of skin color genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/skin-color-review.php). Nearly 40 years ago [quantitative trait loci analysis](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/skin-color-loci-older-work.php) suggested that 4-5 genes control the variation in skin color which distinguishes Africans from Europeans. And now, [new work](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/race-is-skin-deep.php) is pin pointing exactly what those genes of large effect might be. Two [recent](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/09/another-genetics-of-skin-color-review.php) [papers](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/09/skin-color-genes-in-different.php) elucidate the underlying genomic architecture which results in human skin color variation, and the general conclusion seems to be that light skin in northern Eurasia is a derived trait which emerged independently in places like East Asia and Europe.^(\*) Within a few years a quick genomic sequence might be able to determine the expectation and variance of skin colors in the case of interracial couples.  
\* Dark skin seems to itself be a derived trait, but far deeper in our evolutionary history, dating to the time when hominids lost their fur.
