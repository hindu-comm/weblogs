The “Aryan” mind

One of the things that I like emphasize on this site is that human psychology isn’t as straightforward as we might assume. In the area of religion this is important because religion intersects a great deal with public policy and culture, and, I think my fellow atheists often have a fallacious model of how religious people think. The complexity and separability of mental processes and chains of inference are important to keep in mind when we posit a model of how humans “tick,” and we shouldn’t dismiss rationalization or irrationality as aberrations. Here is an interesting passage from [The Master Plan: Himmler’s Scholars and the Holocaust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786868864//geneexpressio-20) (page 42):

> The examiners were well aware that the Reichsführer-SS was not exactly > green-card material \[certificate of Aryan racial purity\], with his > small, pigeon-chested body, round face, sallow skin, dark hair, and > receding chin. Indeed, one racial advisor noted with detachment after > the war that Himmler was “[an unassimilated > half-breed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Heinrich_Himmler_Murderer.jpg) > and unfit for the SS.” But very few people dared to say such things to > their leader’s face. At a social event one evening, however, the wife > of a high-ranking SS officer, Dr. Werner Best, broached the problem > with Himmler. She observed that the Nazi party would instantly lose > its entire leadership-“The Führer, you Herr Himmler, Dr. Goebbels … ” > -if the principles of racial selection were strictly applied. **Himmler was not the least disturbed by this remark, however. He brushed off the criticism**, remarking that while he did not appear Nordic, he certainly possed a Nordic brain.

[Leo Felton](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leo_Felton&oldid=73555852), a white supremacist leader whose father was African American justified his ideological stance in the same manner, drawing upon [Francis Parker Yockey’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Parker_Yockey) conception of spiritual racialism.
