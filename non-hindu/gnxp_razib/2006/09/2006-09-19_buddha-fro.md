Buddha-fro

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/buddhafrow-708561.jpg)[Ruchira Paul](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2006/09/buddha_and_mick.html) points me to an interesting fact which I had always noticed, but never noted, and that is that many Japanese Buddhas have curly hair. Can anyone tell me why this is? I am struck by the fact that depictions of Buddha by Greco-Bacterians was often [Apollonian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/BuddhaHead.JPG) in character, and I am to understand that this culture was prominent in depicting the Buddha at an early time period. Is this a Greco-Bacterian influence, or something else?
