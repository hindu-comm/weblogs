Baby math & the racist friend

The other day I was IMing a friend of mine. She’s a college graduate with two liberal arts degrees. Anyhow, I accused her best friend of racism. See, what happened was that I asked how many men this woman had dated. My friend stated 6 men. I asked if they were all white. My friend said, “Yes, all white.” Well, I was like, “She’s racist, she only dates white men!” Well, this wasn’t convincing, so I was like, “Well, there’s only a 12% expectation that she would date 6 straight white men!” Now, here, my friend was intrigued, “What, where’d you get that number?” I was like, “Well, 70% of the male population consists of white men, 0.7⁶ results in 0.12, or 12% expectation of six straight men being white. So your friend is racist! Probably.” Now…at this point I backed off, and started explaining how since her friend lived in Minnesota the probabilities didn’t work out that way, and what not. But what was scary was **how easy some trivial dumb baby math makes convincing people of totally ludicrous hypotheses!** It was also pretty fun….  
**Update:** Check out this dumbass comment 🙂 I had a good laugh over this….

> Razib,  
> Wow, you must have read the first chapter in a statistics text on probability!  
> You seem like a smart guy, but your sophistry in this case is sophmoric. Knowledge does not equal wisdom.  
> Racism is ‘The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.’  
> A bigot is ‘One who is strongly partial to one’s own group, religion, race, or politics and is intolerant of those who differ.’  
> Just because the friend of your friend has only dated one race does not mean she is a racist. She may be, she may also be a bigot, but you would have to get in her head to know that.  
> You may have math skills, but could use a little liberal arts training in semantics.  
> What on earth does being brown have to do with racism? Humans have been racists and bigots since the beginning of time, regardless of skin color. Smart guys with math skills should know that.
