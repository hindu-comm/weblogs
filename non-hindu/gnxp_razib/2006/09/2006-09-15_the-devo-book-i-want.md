The devo book I want

I read Endless Forms, and I read Coming to Life by Christ. But I still don’t feel like I’ve got anything like a grip on development. Endless Forms avoided specific terminology too much IMHO. I don’t think it necessarily helps anyone’s understanding to make up a new term like “tool-kit genes” in place of “transcription factor.” So I didn’t learn all that much from Mr. Carroll. Coming to Life was a little less lay-book-ey, but still left out the details and (I felt) that there wasn’t an overarching theme. It felt like a list of facts, a description, at a somewhat general level of what happens during development.

I think Dr. Davidson’s new book, [The Regulatory Genome: Gene Regulatory Networks In Development And Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Regulatory-Genome-Networks-Development-Evolution/dp/0120885638/sr=8-1/qid=1158355395/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3894081-8221540?ie=UTF8&s=books), might be the solution I’m looking for. But since it is more like a textbook it comes at more of a textbook price: \$70 new, \~\$60 on Amazon. Dunno how quick I can get it at a library. Anyway, here is some from the book review in Nature Genetics:

> The book begins with an introduction of his idea of the regulatory > genome or the regulatory apparatus encoded in the genome. In the > second chapter, he explains in detail cis-regulatory modules and the > structural and functional basis of regulatory logic. Here the author > emphasizes that comparison of genome sequences of different animals > (or species) is helpful to identify highly conserved cis-regulatory > modules. After a brief explanation in chapter 3 of animal development > as a process of regulatory state specification, Davidson argues > persuasively that cis-regulatory modules act as networks and that the > gene regulatory networks are the key to understanding embryonic > development (chapter 4) and evolutionary construction of various > animal forms (chapter 5). It is also emphasized that computational and > systems biological approaches are essential to create the networks. > Every step of his logic is presented with examples to explain his > idea, with beautiful, well-designed color figures. His concept of the > significant roles of gene regulatory networks in development and > evolution can be clearly understood using the aforementioned key > terms. Namely, animal embryogenesis seems to be established by a > complex combination of input and output linkages, plug-ins and > differentiation gene regulatory batteries, usually in this order. The > diversity of animal forms may be explained in terms of core kernels, > alteration in deployment of plug-ins, input and output linkages and differentiation gene regulatory batteries. This order is important for understanding animal evolution at the level of phylum, class, order and family, respectively.
