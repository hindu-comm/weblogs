Sparta

Apropos of my comment about sex & civilization, a reader brought up Sparta, and over @ [2 Blowhards](http://www.2blowhards.com/) there’s a nice post, [Case Studies in State Formation – Sparta](http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/2006/09/case_studies_in.html):

> There was an extreme egalitarianism on the surface in Sparta, where > all men ate in messes and dressed identically until getting married in > middle age. Indeed, the Spartans called themselves the *homoioi*, > those who are alike. While egalitarianism was a very strong trend > throughout the Greek world during the archaic and classical eras, in > Sparta the appearance of egalitarianism was deceptive, at least in a > politically. Spartan egalitarianism was the result of military > necessity rather than an expression of the economic or social > equality. The Spartan aristocracy never surrendered political control > of Spartan politics.
