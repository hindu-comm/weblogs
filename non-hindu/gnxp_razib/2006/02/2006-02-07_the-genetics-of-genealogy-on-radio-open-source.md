The Genetics of Genealogy on Radio Open Source

*Radio Open Source* is going to do a show on [The Genetics of Genealogy](http://www.radioopensource.org/the-genetics-of-genealogy/). I’ve recently expressed some skepticism about many of the tests peddled by corporations and their scientist promoters, so I’m primed to jump into this discussion. I have already offered a few comments, and will probably post more as the show comes up. Until then, I also **highly** recommend John Hawks’ [comment](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/race/race_testing_penn_state_2005.html) on this topic.  
**Update:** *On Point* with Tom Ashbrook [interviewed](http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2006/02/20060207_b_main.asp) Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his new series [African American Lives](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aalives/), which leverages genetic science in exploring the genealogy of many prominent black Americans. The genealogies of African Americans is one case where I do think that the new genetic science is relevant, unlike whites, blacks whose ancestors were enslaved don’t have parish baptismal records that can serve as a spatial and temporal anchor in their self-conception of their lineage. Though the mtDNA and Y chromosomal tests leave much to be desired in precision (just because frequency of an allele is modal in a given area does not mean that one’s ancestors derived from the modal area), they are certainly better than nothing (or fantasized conjecture). But, a second point is that I suspect Gates is making too much of many of these tests, and a bit confused as to the reach of the science. This of course is less a fault of Gates than of the scientists who he has collaborated with.
