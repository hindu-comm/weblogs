Bosom Buddies

Nothing to do with genes, but you may like to know that the latest issue of **Vanity Fair** features **Keira Knightley** and **Scarlett Johansson** butt-naked on the cover. Apparently it was the first time they’d met, but hopefully not the last. According to one account, “After she and Johansson kissed each other goodbye, Knightley said with a smile: ‘Lovely to meet you. I’ll see you again some time… naked, I’m sure.'” Hold that thought…
