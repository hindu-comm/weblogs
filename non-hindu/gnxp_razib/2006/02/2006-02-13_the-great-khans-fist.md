The Great Khan’s Fist

Anyone who has long read my [other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com) knows I have a strong interest in several historical questions. With [John Emerson](http://www.idiocentrism.com/) I share a deep interest in [Central Asian history](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002792.html), so with that in mind, I point you to the refurbished essay (it has maps!) [2000 years of barbarians in 50 minutes](http://www.idiocentrism.com/2000years.htm).
