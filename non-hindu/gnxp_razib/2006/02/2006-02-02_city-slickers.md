City slickers

*Wired* has an article up about [urban coyotes](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70136-0.html?tw=wn_index_6):

> …coyotes are thriving in city suburbs like Itasca and Palatine > Village, and have even been spotted in the heart of Chicago’s > metropolitan area.  
> They’ve also been sighted in other major urban areas, including St. > Louis, Minneapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and Boston, Gehrt said — a > result, in part, of increased urban sprawl and coyotes’ adaptability.

**Update:** It’s been pointed out to me that *Seed* has already [covered this topic](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/01/wily_coyotes_move_to_the_windy.php?page=all&p=y).
