Naturalistic biological evolution

The “standard model” of intellectual history presents the [Presocratics](http://www.presocratics.org/) as the pioneers of **naturalistic** explanations of the universe around us. This narrative explains how the messy natural philosophy of the Presocratics gave way to the more metaphysical and ethical schools of the late Classical and Hellenistic and Roman eras. In any case, Socialist Swine asks below:

Well, 10 minutes of google print pointed me to [Empedocles](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/e/empedocl.htm), who did happen to be a Presocratic. His “theory of evolution” wasn’t exactly a process of evolution as we understand today. But, it is naturalistic, and it shows that evolutionary thought was not totally novel. [The internet encyclopedia of philosophy](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/e/empedocl.htm) has extensive commentary on Empedocles’ ideas, but if you want more, I suggest [google print](https://books.google.com), or amazon’s search feature.  
I have [expressed the opinion](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/endless-forms-most-continuous.php) that the human mind is biased against Darwinian evolution, but, the idea space that our species explores can be rather large. Even if you have an ***expectation***, human variation (***variance*** or error) often dictates that there are always those who swim against the current and generate some inevitable turbidity in the sea of human experience. In [The Alternative Tradition: A Study of Unbelief in the Ancient World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9027979979/geneexpressio-20/) we see that movements like the Epicureans in ancient Greece, the [Carvaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvaka) in India or the non-supernatural strain in Confucianism exemplified by sage [Xunzi](http://www.iep.utm.edu/x/xunzi.htm) exhibit the **naturalistic** strain in intellectual history. This strain comes to the fore in complex literate civilizations where dissenters can attain critical mass and organize a counter-culture against normative supernaturalism (for instance, the [Pyrrohnian Skeptics](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepanci.htm) dominated the intellectual life of Athens until the rise of Neoplatonism during the Roman period). Of course we don’t need to look just to the naturalistic paradigm to see glimmers of a conception of evolution, the legends and mythologies of most peoples are riddled with transformation of animal to man and vice versa, so extracting the magical elements should naturally occur to some.  
**Addendum:** From [A Primer of Conservation Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521538270/geneexpressio-20/):

What does this have to do with the rest of the post? I **conceive of predisposition to religous belief as a quantitative trait**. Some people are very “zealous,” some people not at all, and most people somewhere in the middle. The suggestion I’m offering here is that atheists and their ilk (our ilk) might, in part, be a byproduct of the [genetic load](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Genetic_load.asp) of any population which is continuously replenished by loss of function mutation. In other words, the reason why we are always hanging around no matter the fact that our stereotypical asociality results in reduced fitness is that we are the end product of inevitable mutational processes. The low, but persistent, frequency of atheists and agnostics within a population might be a case of [mutation-selection balance](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Mutation-selection_balance.asp)….
