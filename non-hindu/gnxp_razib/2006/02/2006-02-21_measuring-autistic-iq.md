Measuring Autistic IQ

ScienceNOW Daily News has an article on [The Case of Mistaken IQ](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/220/1):

> Health workers routinely assess autistics using a standard IQ test > known as the Wechsler test. But this test requires that children > understand oral commands, a trait that many autistic children have > trouble with. Cognitive neuroscientist Laurent Mottron of the Hopital > Riviere-des-Prairies, Montreal and colleagues noticed that autistic children did poorly on the verbal comprehension part of the Wechsler but exceedingly well on a part that tests non-verbal intelligence and reasoning. >
> So the researchers decided to test 30 autistic children and 30 > autistic adults with a different IQ test called the Raven’s > Progressive Matrices test, which is written rather than oral. Healthy > children and adults performed similarly on both the Wechsler and the > Raven test. But speaking autistics scored up to 30 percentile points > higher on the Raven test than the Wechsler test, the researchers > reported here 19 February at the annual meeting for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (which publishes ScienceNOW). “Thirty percentile points could raise a retarded person to normal or a normal one to a superintelligent one,” says Mottron.

It sounds like a bit of factor analysis could have gotten them the same result. I didn’t find an actual reference, but here’s [the AAAS press release about the symposium](http://www.news.wisc.edu/12198.html).
