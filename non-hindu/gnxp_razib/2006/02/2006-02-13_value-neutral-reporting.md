Value Neutral Reporting

Let’s see if you can spot the bias (I’ll give you a hint) in the following report on Immigration Reform published in [Newsweek](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11299201/site/newsweek/):

> The Senate will debate three initiatives of a very different nature. > First up is the so-called Sensenbrenner bill, already passed by the > House of Representatives. Among other **hateful** features, the > legislation seeks to build more than 1,000 kilometers of fences and > walls along the U.S.-Mexican border, makes unauthorized entry into the > United States a felony and penalizes anyone aiding or abetting illegal > immigrants. >
> \[ . . . . . \] >
> Five years ago, Mexican President Vicente Fox tried to convince George > W. Bush that something had to be done about this situation before a > conservative, perhaps even **xenophobic backlash** in the United > States began to drastically complicate its relations with Latin > America. For a series of reasons, no progress has been made since > Fox’s visit to Washington on the eve of September 11, 2001; in the > meantime matters have, as Fox predicted, gotten much worse.

So, first off, why would a US decision to regulate its own borders **rightly provoke** Mexican anger? The way this article reads you’d think that Mexico is being denied its rightful place at the table to decide what the US should do to protect its own national interests.

Does anyone else see the irony of Mexico securing its Southern borders by instituting procedures beyond sealing its borders and arresting emmigrants? I wonder if those measures might include a non-hateful wall?
