Talking about race

Dan Jones has two posts that might be of interest to readers, [Race â€“ Fact Or Fiction?](https://psom.blogspot.com/2006/01/race-fact-or-fiction.html) and [Race Reprised, and the Difficulties of Debate](https://psom.blogspot.com/2006/02/race-reprised-and-difficulties-of.html). Those of you who have ventured into virgin message boards with various heterodoxies will find it enjoyable and familiar I suspect.
