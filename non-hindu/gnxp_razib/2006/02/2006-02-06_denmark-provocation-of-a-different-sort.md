Denmark provocation of a different sort

**Update:** Trivial prediction: more Muslims will die because of “protests” and riots because of the Danish cartoons than non-Muslims.  
[Matt McIntosh](http://conjecturesandrefutations.net/weblog/) has posted a piece titled [We Have Met the Enemy, and He Is Us](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/we-have-met-enemy-and-he-is-us.php) at my other blog. It has [spawned a lot of comments](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/raldanash/113910558332996232/). Many people were offended by the way Matt couched his thought experiment and the character of his exposition. I jumped in to defend him, and below is a somewhat florid summation at the end of the thread (excuse the lack of capitalization, it is not an affectation, just a way to save keystrokes when I’m entering comments):

> ok, here is my opinion, not to make too much of a stretched analogy, > but consider rene descartes. though i’m more of an ’empiricist’ than a > ‘rationalist’ in sentiment, descartes and his rationalist project were > magnificant extrapolations of what makes us human, our ability to > abstract and metarepresent alternative ideas in our mind’s eye. > cartesian rationalism started from a point of radical doubt and > skepticism of all the values and intuitions that his contemporaries > held dear. descartes’ radicalism extended to god, he doubted god > himself before coming around to the inevitable ‘proof’ (a variation on > the ontological proof from what i recall). the point here is that > descartes remained a faithful catholic, but he explored the > implications of rationality to its logical limit, which included his > own religion.  
> i am a liberal in the broad, classical, sense. as is matt. i have a > powerful personal animus toward islam especially amongst the religions > that man has created. nevertheless, i believe a position of radical > amoral doubt is important in comprehending the nature of the beast, we > must shed our heart and look deep into our minds and see if we can > gather some insight on topics that are pretty difficult for the > ‘scientific’ method to investigate. cognitive psychology of religion > is important because thoughts are the atoms upon which the institution > of religion is built, even though the institution is shaped by a host > of higher order cultural and historical factors. why did the people of > carthage offer up their children in burnt offerings to their gods? (i > believe that the urns are evidence of child sacrifice, i know some > dissent) why did the kamikazes behave the way they did? why do muslims > behave so bestially?  
> ultimately, these are questions whose roots lay in human psychology, i > believe. they may not, but we will never known unless we strike into > those waters, shorn, at least temporarily, of anything but the coldest > eye of clinical examination.  
> descarte wondered how he could know that an evil demon did not > generate the world as an illusion, how could he trust one’s intuitons? > that did not mean that he denied his senses in the operational > activity of his daily intercourse with other humans, that he ceased to > be a fully feeling human embedded in convential exchanges based on an > assumption of the validity of his eyes and ears. suspending heart felt > judgement and values is necessary for us to conceive of islam clearly > and distinctly. i don’t know if it is possible to study religion in a > scientific way as anthropologists like scott atran or pascal boyer are > attempting, but we should try.  
> there are many places on the web where muslims are treated as > oppressed minorities who are driven to barbarism by western racism. in > other places they are metaphysically inspiried animals who are > unfathomable, creatures outside the bounds of rational understanding. > in these places various emotions reign supreme. i am trying to clear > the waters for a small place where we are disciplined and put aside > our feelings in the service of unnatural expositions and > examinations.  
> for truth, i agree with hume, reason is just the servant of passion. > my passions are clear, and they lay with the west, there is no doubt > of that. but for reason to go about its task the master must let the > leash loose on occasion so that it may hunt in the darkness that > passion can not perceive. some of us have great hounds of reason at > our disposal, i like to think, and my wish is that the hounds should > gather and swarm here, out of the sights of the masters for a bit, and > see what emerges from the darkness.
