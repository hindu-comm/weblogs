Swedish security police shut down Mohammed cartoon site

This is the most breathtaking example of multiculturalism in action I have encountered in quite some time, as well as breaking news:

The Swedish security police (SAPO) [intervened last night](http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_11790299.asp) against the site of far-right political party Sverigedemokraterna (sd), getting their Internet provider to shut down their site (www.sverigedemokraterna.se).

As far as I have been able to make out, there was not even a court-order involved. (The site is now back up, without the drawings…)The party had been holding a “Draw Mohammed” contest, which in turn created bad blood in the middle east. (The usual suspects: Hezbollah et. al.)

The foreign minister [justified the action](http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=520257) with the party creating a danger to Swedish interests abroad.

All the links are in Swedish so far, but hopefully some english-language information should be available soon-ish.

UPDATE: [The Stockholm Spectator](http://www.spectator.se/stambord/?p=1100) has a post in english up – not much additional info, but I suspect they will keep on this case. Worth a look.

UPDATE II: It appears the Security Police merely placed a friendly phonecall to the ISP of Sverigedemokraterna “informing them of the situation”. Oh well then, never mind.
