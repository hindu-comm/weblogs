Conservatives and Christians for evolution

Nathanial Blake, editor of the [conservative campus publication](http://www.theliberty.org/) at Oregon State University, has a [good piece](http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/NathanaelBlake/2006/02/24/187797.html) addressing the issue of evolution and evangelicals over at the *Town Hall* website. He points out that even C.S. Lewis, that exemplar of modern Protestant Christian orthodoxy, accepted evolutionary theory. The coupling of anti-evolutionary feeling and a segment of conservative Protestant movement goes to show that culture can tack in bizarre directions not under control from on high, the fact is that evolution was generally a marginal issue in early 20th century Christian circles, and not even [William Jennings Bryan](http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAbryan.htm) was a Young Earth Creationist. Today elite conservatives like George Will amd Charles Krauthammer still resist the conservative populist zeitgeist on this issue.  
There has been a lot of discussion on [Science Blogs](http://www.scienceblogs.com) about convincing the public about evolutionary theory. Well, people like Nathaniel Blake have credibility because they [attend pro-life protests](http://www.townhall.com/opinion/column/NathanaelBlake/2006/01/27/184104.html). What does that have to do with evolution? Fundamentally nothing. Cognitively and socially, a lot. Only Nixon could go to Chinaâ€¦.
