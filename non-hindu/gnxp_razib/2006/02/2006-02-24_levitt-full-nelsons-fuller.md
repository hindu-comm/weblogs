Levitt full nelsons Fuller

Norm Levitt throws [an excellent broadside](http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Fuller.cfm) against Steve Fuller (yes, it is a polemic, but a delicious one!).  
**Update:** Ron in the comments suggests we be cautious about accepting Levitt’s jeremiad in its totality. He concludes:

> And from our own point of view, we must view the whole universe, > including those parts which the candle of our scientific knowledge does not reveal. In this effort, religion, understood as the rational ordering of our values, ethics, wisdom and compassion, is an **indispensable guide**.

*A* does not imply *Z* here. That is, I cautioned that Levitt’s piece was a “polemic” and use the term “jeremiad” for a reason. Though he expresses a sentiment with which I tend to concur, his details exhibit a tendency to be overly glib and superficial in his treatment of the opposition. To give an example, Levitt characterizes William Dembski as a Protestant when he is an [Orthodox Christian](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/014/18.20.html) (a convert). Additionally, his characterization of Steve Fuller implies that he is a species of Post Modernist, when he [technically is not](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/fullers_dover_testimony/).  
I believe that **characterizing your opponents *precisely* is essential to making a good reasoned argument**. Levitt’s piece has a core with which I agree, but some of the scaffolding is sloppily applied. Both [Higher Superstition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801857074/geneexpressio-20/) and [The Flight from Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801856760/geneexpressio-20), tracts penned in part by Levitt, exhibit this tendency. They are polemics that offer a great deal of red meat, but suggest that the authors do not feel fully comfortable in the landscapes of nonsense which they traverse to pass judgement.  
Nevertheless, there are real issues that Levitt brings up which need to be addressed, and the primary once is that Fuller and many scholars of science seem to lack any scientific background themselves. I do not necessarily believe that a scientific background is an automatic precondition for someone to study science as a social enterprise, anymore than being a black American is a necessary precondition for studying that community. Nevertheless, unlike being a black American, full participation in the scientific culture is accessible to scholars of science. [Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn) was a physicist before he became a philospher and historian of science. And a stint as a scientist is not necessary in my opinion to understand the culture of science, but some time in a lab as a tech might help, and that is within reach of almost anyone. An analogy with anthropology is appropriate here, one does not need to become a member of the tribe, but one must certainly live amongst them. When I expressed some of these opinions over at [The Valve](http://www.thevalve.org/go/) Jonathan Goodwin [missed my point](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/fullers_dover_testimony/#5767) by saying:

> Razib, I disagree very strongly with Fuller’s position about this–to > the point of mystification–but it’s parochial to suggest that more time **taking multiple-choice tests and dissecting things** would have affected his later thinking. It’s just completely irrelevant to the argument he’s making.

If one believes that science is “taking multiple-choice tests” and “dissecting things” than one certainly doesn’t know science. Even a year as an undergraduate in a laboratory would disabuse you of such notions! Levitt does speak to a serious problem among scholars of science. This problem is exacerbated by the problem that **science is not natural**, so it is even harder to understand than a typical “alien” culture (see [See the Naturalness of Science and the Unnaturalness of Religion](http://userwww.service.emory.edu/%7Ephilrnm/publications/articles/Naturalness%20of%20Religion.pdf)).  
All that said, I think Ron’s last point is tenditious. He states, “In this effort, religion, understood as the rational ordering of our values, ethics, wisdom and compassion, is an **indispensable guide**.” First, I do not believe religion in general is about a “rational” ordering of much of anything. Christianity has coopted the ethical philosophy of the classical world to generate systems of Natural Law which can be “proved” *a priori*, but I don’t think that these “proofs” are anything other that *posteriori* rationalizations of innate moral intuitions. Certainly a world without poetry, religion, literature or music would be poorer to ***most*** people, but some people are tone deaf, some people lack appreciation for poetic meter and emotion and others lack a interest in the interpersonal dynamics so central to literary exposition. And yes, some people simply do not perceive a need to populate their universe with supernatural agents which bring a “rational” ordering to the laws and dynamics which characterize our natural universe, nor is there a need for these for godlings to lay the stamp of divine favor upon moral laws which they believe are good and true because they express our innermost humanity in some fashion or form. They are no less human for it.  
A common refrain by those who criticize my enthusiasm for science is that there is more to life than science. My response is **because I do not speak of it does not mean I do not give it its due**. Similarly, the assault on the structure of modern science that the likes of Steve Fuller are engaging in to further their own careers and pet theories is naturally going to invite a sharp and vociferous response. But never confuse this response with the totality of experience and sentiment of the responders, a reflexive kick back in the face of an assault does not encapsulate the range of action of said individual.
