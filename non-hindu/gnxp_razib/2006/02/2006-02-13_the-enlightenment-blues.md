The Enlightenment blues….

Diana of [Letter from Gotham](https://letterfromgotham.blogspot.com/2006/02/true-confession.html) [expresses](https://letterfromgotham.blogspot.com/2006/02/true-confession.html) some of what I’ve been thinking. I am rather uninspired by what I perceive as the relative silence on the Left and the swarming hysterics on the Right.¹ Though I tend to sympathize with the suspicion of Islam evinced by many on the Right, I have [commented](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/raldanash/113910558332996232/) on the problems with a singular focus on **reiteration of values** in a vacuum of empirically driven analysis, and attempted to [address the issue](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/02/believing-introspection-of-fool.php) obliquely later in the form of a post. As for the silence of the Left, I am silent myself because the gut reaction is so inchoate and underwhelming.  
**Addendum:** I don’t read many blogs, but [Ed Brayton](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/) seems to have stood firm for free speech without temporizing.  
1 – Well, I’ve come close to being hysterical myself. [See here](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/002975.html). Boy does it feel good, but the end of the day there needs to be more than trite recitations of Truths we Hold True.
