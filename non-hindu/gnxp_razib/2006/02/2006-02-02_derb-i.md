Derb & I

John Derbyshire [compliments me a bit](http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200602021003.asp) in his January Diary over at *NRO*, under “Jeunesse.” Who wouldn’t link to someone patting them on the back? He takes a jab at Intelligent Design under “The Blogger’s Life.” Derb’s almost finished reading Mark Ridley’s [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199267944/geneexpressio-20/), I’m praying he’ll mention his insights in another column and keep taking a stand against what he considers a “folk religion.” His new book, [Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030909657X/geneexpressio-20/), should be out sometime in April.
