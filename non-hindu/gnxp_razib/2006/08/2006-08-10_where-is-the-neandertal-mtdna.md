Where is the Neandertal mtDNA?

Blogger [NuSapiens](https://www.nusapiens.blogspot.com/) offers an intriguing \<a href=" comment on my post about Neandertal introgression:

> It’s been shown that some mtDNA lines are associated with metabolic > adaptations related to climate. This is a serious violation of the neutrality requirement for tracking things, especially far back in time. Adam and Eve are cute stories, but I wonder whether they will be around after another generation.  
> Neanderthal disappeared during a climate shift in Europe. If Neanderthal mtDNA was adapted to Euro-tundra, I wouldn’t expect that to stick around very long during a thaw period. If at all, it might be in the far north.

Does this make sense? There is [evidence](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/303/5655/223) for selection on particular metabolic rates in mtDNA. In fact, we also know that modern high latitude populations [exhibit metabolic adaptations](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C05E6DE1F31F93AA35752C0A9629C8B63).
