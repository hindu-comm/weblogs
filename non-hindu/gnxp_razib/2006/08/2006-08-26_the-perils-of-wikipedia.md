The perils of Wikipedia

In an entry below I offer that the citation of a Wikipedia reference is not reliable, and I can’t take responsibility if someone changes the entry between my link and your click. I am not totally kidding, I “Wikipediaed” a semi-famous individual recently and the entry described him as a serial rapist. In broken English. Someone was obviously bored, or had a bad experience with this small time celeb. I quickly reedited it, but it sure brought home to me the problem with Wikipedia. But then I thought: **could you, as a blogger, just reedit or write your own Wikipedia entries and then link to them as a citation?**  
Anyway, I guess you could say I’m pretty cautious about linking to Wikipedia in regards to things that I’m not totally sure about, or that are not copiously cited. A lot of the technical stuff is good, and Wikipedia is actually often well referenced on many entries, so it is a good starting point, but it sure isn’t The Answer (and remember, Iverson’s field goal % isn’t that high). There are similar problems with google. For example,

  
a) You have hypothesis/assertion A  
b) Someone calls you on it  
c) You proceed to use google (and google scholar) to find 10 citations which back you up  
d) But there is a problem, **the set of all studies relating to hypothesis/assertion A is enormous**, it is very easy to simply return back an unrepresentative sample of studies which do support your particular hypothesis via a query  
e) So, two things, the citations need to be unbiased and representative of the totality of the scholarship. And second, **you need to actually know something about the field or the topic so you can use google intelligently**. Most people who I have had this issue with are offering up an unrepresentative sample without knowing because they don’t know the shape of the distribution *a priori*.  
**Update:** From the comments:

> A citation or link to Wikipedia should be in citation format — which > means its unchangeable.  
> For instance, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Oak takes you to the > ever changing (or not) description of Faulkner’s home.  
> Conversely, > http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rowan_Oak&oldid=71987882 > takes you to a time/date frozen version which will never change.  
> To get the citation link, click on the “cite this article” link under > the search box when viewing the main article.
