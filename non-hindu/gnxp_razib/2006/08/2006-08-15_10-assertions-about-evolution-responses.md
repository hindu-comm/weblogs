10 assertions about evolution – responses

I will “house” responses to my 10 assertions about evolution query in this post.  
So far, only [RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/08/10_assertions_about_evolution.php) has taken the bait. He asks some interesting questions in regards to the rather vague scope & nature of this query…but this was purposeful. If you examine RPM’s list you see that it is clearly more focused toward the general public than my own list, which ended up highlighting possible differences of opinion within the Faith (e.g., [Bora’s](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/) & my own longstanding debates about levels of selection and what not). This is good, my overall aim is to synthesize a list which focuses on the intersecting commonalities. Some “hard science” and “culture war” elements should be included, as science & culture do meet in the public domain….  
Hopefully more later. If I don’t see your post, simply post a link in the comments. I’m going to make a proactive call out to [John Hawks](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog), [Robert Skipper](http://drrob.typepad.com/hpb_etc/), [John Wilkins](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/) and [Afarensis](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/).  
**Update:** [Afarensis here](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2006/08/15/10_assertions_about_evolution/#more).  
**Update II:** [Skipper steps up to the plate](http://drrob.typepad.com/hpb_etc/2006/08/razib_has_assig.html). Hawks and Wilkins and all the other nameless savants are still not in the running…. (I found some of Rob’s assertions hilarious, e.g., “genetic drift is not binomial sampling”).  
**Update III:** [Wilkins steps up](http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/08/ten_things_about_evolution.php).  
**Update IV:** Save the best for last? [John Hawks finally responds](http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/misc/ten_assertions_public_consumption_2006.html).  
(**Note:** I will link to all responses on Monday from my other weblog, which gets about 6 times more traffic than this one according to Sitemeter, so there is a morsel out there for those of you who bite on promises of more traffic)
