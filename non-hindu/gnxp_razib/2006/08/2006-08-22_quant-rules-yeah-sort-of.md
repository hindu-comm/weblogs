Quant rules? Yeah, sort of….

[Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2006/08/portrait-of-quant-ii.html) pointed me to this [article](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_34/b3998412.htm) [The Quintessential Quant](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_34/b3998412.htm). The article highlights the standard, IIT, MIT, etc && physics, math, etc. need only apply. On the fly C++ under pressure, etc. But here is the money shot:

> A typical offer, say sources, starts with a base salary of around > \$250,000, plus a guaranteed annual bonus that could double that. The > best can command a cut of a fund’s upside — beaucoup bucks when you > consider the multibillion-dollar asset pots. All this, yet, says > Seanor, “most of these guys have never even had a real job.”

Is it me, or does \$250,000 K as a baseline salary seem a little low for the **best of the best**. The thing is, I have friends who spent 4 years memorizing junk in medical school and ground their way through a residency, and they are within spitting distance of that sort of salary. Granted, there’s a lot more on top of that…but normalizing for how smart these guys are, on the scale of remuneration it seems they’re getting jacked. Why don’t they just start a business and get asset rich real quick?
