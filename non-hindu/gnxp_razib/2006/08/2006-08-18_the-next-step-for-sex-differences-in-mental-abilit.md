The next step for sex differences in mental abilities

Wendy Johnson and Thomas Bouchard are tearing up the “Articles in Press” section of *Intelligence*. Their [latest work](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.003) expands on their recent paper on [sex differences in mental abilities](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/sex-differences-in-mental-abilities_29.php) described by Darth Quixote.

The follow-up, [“Sex differences in mental ability: A proposed means to link them to brain structure and function”](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.003), argues that the pattern of male-female differences in non-g factors could be explained by structural differences in the brain, which they propose to study. They conclude:

> there appear to be two basic dimensions of residual ability that > underlie g (Johnson & Bouchard, in press). **They involve > rotation-verbal and focus-diffusion cognitive approaches to > problem-solving. Men and women tend to differ on these dimensions.** > Men are concentrated more toward the rotation pole of the > rotation-verbal dimension and women are concentrated more toward the > verbal pole. Men are concentrated more toward the focus pole of the > focus-diffusion dimension and women are concentrated more toward the > diffusion pole. Three different batteries of mental ability tests show > very consistent patterns of lack of measurement invariance across sex > and each of the two residual ability dimensions. **This is consistent > with the hypothesis that these dimensions identify differences in > cognitive approaches to problem solving that may be reflected in > individual and sex differences in brain structure and function.** This > hypothesis can be readily tested using two novel approaches to scoring > the WAIS. In addition, knowledge of participants’ positions along > these dimensions may help to explain already observed individual > differences in brain structure and function. **We propose that > investigation of these dimensions will contribute substantively to our > understanding of how the biological brain produces abstract > intellectual performance.**
