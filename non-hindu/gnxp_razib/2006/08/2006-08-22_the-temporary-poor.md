The temporary poor

There is an [interesting article concerning the Official Poverty Rate](http://www.policyreview.org/138/eberstadt.html) in the latest issue of [Policy Review](http://www.policyreview.org/). The thrust is that in the past 3 decades the OPR shows stagnation while all sorts of other indicators of the well-being of the lowest income portion of Americans are rising. How come? The OPR is based on income instead of expenditures, and income is a funky measure because year-to-year variance in income has been rising. A larger percentage of people who spend and live like they are above the poverty line are having occasional off-years where they dip below the income marker, but everything else points to steady improvements in the conditions for low-income families.

> To summarize the evidence from physical and biometric indicators: > Low-income and poverty-level households today are better-fed and less > threatened by undernourishment than they were a generation ago. Their > homes are larger, better equipped with plumbing and kitchen > facilities, and more capaciously furnished with modern conveniences. > They are much more likely to own a car (or a light truck, or another > type of motor vehicle) now than 30 years earlier. By most every > indicator apart from obesity, their health care status is considerably > more favorable today than at the start of the War on Poverty. Their > utilization of health and medical services has steadily increased over > recent decades. >
> All of this is in one sense reassuring. These data underscore the > basic fact that low-income Americans *have* been participating in what > Orshansky termed â€œAmericaâ€™s parade of progress.â€? Orshansky had > worried that the poor in modern America might be watching that parade > and â€œwait\[ing\] for their turn â€” a turn that does not comeâ€?; > fortunately, her apprehension has proved to be unfounded. >
> To state this much is not to assert that material progress for > Americaâ€™s poverty population has been satisfactory, much less > optimal. Nor is it to deny the importance of relative as opposed to > absolute deprivation in the phenomenon of poverty as the poor > themselves experience it. Those are serious questions that merit > serious discussion, but they are questions distinct and separate from > the focus of this study â€” i.e. the reliability of the official > poverty rate per se as an indicator of material deprivation. >
> As we have seen, the U.S. federal poverty measure is premised on the > assumption that official poverty thresholds provide an *absolute* > poverty standard â€” a fixed inter-temporal resource constraint. Such > a standard should mean that general material conditions for the > poverty population should remain more or less invariant over time. Yet > quite clearly, the material condition of the poverty population in > modern America has *not* been invariant over time â€” it has been > steadily improving. The OPR thus fails â€” one is tempted to say that > it fails spectacularly â€” to measure what it purports to be tracking > over time. As an indicator of a condition originally defined in 1965, > the official poverty rate seems to have become an ever less faithful > and reliable measure with each passing year.
