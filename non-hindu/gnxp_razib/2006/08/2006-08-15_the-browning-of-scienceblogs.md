The browning of ScienceBlogs

Seems like I am no longer the undisputed champion of “brownest ass amongst ScienceBlogs,” as [Scientific Brown](http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/) has joined the pack. That doesn’t mean that my ass isn’t still the brownest, just that it isn’t a no contest situation when it was just [Nick Anthis](http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/) & [Steinn Sigurðsson](http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/) offering up their melanically challenged derrieres as tokens against the all powerful rich wood colored tone of mine own buns.  
**Update:** Texas-born Nick Anthis isn’t pasty, just for the record he has produced convincing proof on the comment boards.
