[The Golden Rule & Christian altruism](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/the_golden_rule_christian_altr.php), [God & conservatism part n…](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/heather_mac_donald_responds_go.php) and [God & morality](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/god_morality.php) are follow ups on the [Heather Mac Donald vs. the Right who are religious saga](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/god_heather_mac_donald_and_con.php). Heather has received a lot of flack from her political fellow travellers, and though I don’t necessarily agree with every element of Heather’s [argument](http://www.amconmag.com/2006/2006_08_28/article14.html), I do think the Right has moved too far in soaking its arguments with the imprimatur of divine sanction. Ramesh Ponnuru made big noises about how his argument in Party of Death was *not* religious, but most outside of the Right ignored him because they simply can not conceive of **any** conservative argument as not having a religious tinge (I think this preconception is false, but, I think it is supported by the close connection between evangelical religious groups and modern conservatism). The Right does not need to turn to Randian godlessness, rather, it should perhaps temper some of its populist evangelicaism so to as spread the tent a bit bigger. (Also, check out [Right Reason](http://rightreason.ektopos.com/) for responses to some of my posts. Does anyone know how many blogs Steve Burton contributes to? Besides God that is)

Also, [two](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/the_dangers_of_interracial_mar.php) [posts](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/the_interracial_gamble.php) on hybridization in the human context. Pictures too.
