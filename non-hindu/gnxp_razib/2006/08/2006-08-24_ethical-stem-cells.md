Ethical stem cells

You’ve probably heard about the new technique to facilitate the use of embryonic stem cells without destroying them? [Devil Boy Jake](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2006/08/ethical_stem_cells.php) has a [science oriented review](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2006/08/ethical_stem_cells.php), and [Poreless Anthis](http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2006/08/post.php) has a more [public policy focused post](http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2006/08/post.php). I have no particular insights on this topic, as I noted in [my own post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/stem_cells_having_your_embryo.php), though in the comments godless offered a [comment](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/stem_cells_having_your_embryo.php#comment-202214) which reflected some of my own cautious perceptions, to which [Darwin Catholic](https://darwincatholic.blogspot.com/) [responded](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/08/stem_cells_having_your_embryo.php#comment-202540). Over at [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/) not a word out of Ponnuru, and Lopez is [rather subdued](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjJiMmQ1ZGI5YWZmODRjMGQxZDY2MGZmMmExNzBiMWE=), so perhaps much ado about nothing….
