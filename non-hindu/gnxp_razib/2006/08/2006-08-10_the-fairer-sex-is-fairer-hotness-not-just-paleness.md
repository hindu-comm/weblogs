The fairer sex is fairer (hotness, not just paleness)

Satoshi Kanazawa has a [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=IssueURL&_tockey=%23TOC%236932%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23&amp;amp;amp;amp;_auth=y&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f76b37c848422fef79d8d7a7d90a1c58) in press at The Journal of Theoretical Biology which is of some interest. Here is the abstract:

> The generalized [Trivers-Willard > hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivers_-willard_hypothesis)…proposes > that parents who possess any heritable trait which increases the male > reproductive success at a greater rate than female reproductive > success in a given environment will have a higher-than-expected > offspring sex ratio, and parents who possess any heritable trait which > increases the female reproductive success at a greater rate than male > reproductive success in a given environment will have a > lower-than-expected offspring sex ratio. One heritable trait which > increases the reproductive success of daughters much more than that of > sons is physical attractiveness. I therefore predict that physically > attractive parents have a lower-than-expected offspring sex ratio > (more daughters). Further, if beautiful parents have more daughters > and physical attractiveness is heritable, then, over evolutionary > history, women should gradually become more attractive than men. The > analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health…confirm both of these hypotheses. Very attractive individuals are 26% less likely to have a son, and women are significantly more physically attractive than men in the representative American sample.

The Triver’s-Willard Hypothesis is pretty straightforward, but, let’s take the finding that females are, on average, better looking than males at face value (Kanazawa seems to have used bilateral symmetry as a proxy, and let’s ignore the confounding effect of greater male developmental instability). What does this imply? Well, it implies that sexual selection upon women has operated for a long period of time, because dimorphism [takes a relatively long time](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003689.html) to evolve relative to non-sex differentiated traits.

Addendum: You can find the full manuscript in the [gnxp forum files](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnxpforum/) under ‘Kanazawa.”
