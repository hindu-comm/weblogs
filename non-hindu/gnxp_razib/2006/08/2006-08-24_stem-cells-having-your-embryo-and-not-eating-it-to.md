Stem cells – having your embryo and not eating it too?

[Stem cell breakthrough promises to overcome ethical objections](http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article1221323.ece). I don’t know, this is going to be **all over the news**, well, it [already is](https://news.google.com/?ncl=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article1221323.ece&hl=en). I don’t think Ramesh Ponnuru or Kathryn Lopez are going to shut up about it for a long time. I am cautiously optimistic, but unfortunately this will be immediately heralded and accepted because of the ethical issues that some have with embryonic stem cells, whether it turns out to be a dead end or not. I have no great insights on this, so go read the articles, or check out the other *ScienceBlogs* (I happened to check google news, so that’s why I hit it first).  
**Update:** Ah, I spoke too soon. Devil-boy Jake Young [already blogged it](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2006/08/ethical_stem_cells.php). As I thought.
