Buddhist Hawks

Over in The Corner today Heather Mac Donald [stated](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk4OWJjMDkyMDhjYWMwNDM4YWVhMDNjY2JmMjFiMDA=):

> The Bible is as open-ended a text as any other. Ever since Medieval theologians tried to contain Biblical interpretation through hermeneutics, it has evaded all efforts to rein it in.

Long time readers of this blog will know that I tend to accept this as a good first approximation. So check this out [Pro-war Buddhist monks in brawl](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/17/sri.lanka.buddhist.reut/index.html):
