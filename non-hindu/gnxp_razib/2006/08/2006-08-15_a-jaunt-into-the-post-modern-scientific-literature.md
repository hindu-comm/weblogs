A Jaunt into the Post-Modern "Scientific" Literature

The *International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare* has seen fit to advance the state of humanity’s knowledge by publishing the [article](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1479-6988.2006.00041.x) “Deconstructing The Evidence-Based Discourse In Health Sciences: Truth, Power And Fascism” in their latest issue:

> **Background** Drawing on the work of the late French philosophers > Deleuze and Guattari, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate > that the evidence-based movement in the health sciences is > outrageously exclusionary and dangerously normative with regards to scientific knowledge. As such, we assert that the evidence-based movement in health sciences constitutes a good example of microfascism at play in the contemporary scientific arena. >
> **Objective** The philosophical work of Deleuze and Guattari proves to > be useful in showing how health sciences are colonised > (territorialised) by an all-encompassing scientific research paradigm – that of post-positivism – but also and foremost in showing the process by which a dominant ideology comes to exclude alternative forms of knowledge, therefore acting as a fascist structure. >
> **Conclusion** The Cochrane Group, among others, has created a > hierarchy that has been endorsed by many academic institutions, and > that serves to (re)produce the exclusion of certain forms of research. > Because ‘regimes of truth’ such as the evidence-based movement currently enjoy a privileged status, scholars have not only a scientific duty, but also an ethical obligation to deconstruct these regimes of power.

You can read the full paper [here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/holmes-deconstruction-ebhc-06.pdf) and you really should for only then can you savor such exquisite insights as:

> Rather than risk being alienated from their colleagues, many > scientists find themselves interpellated by hegemonic discourses and > come to disregard all others. Unfortunately, privileging a single > discourse (evidence-based medicine (EBM)) situated within a single > scientific paradigm (postpositivism) confines the researcher to a yoke > of exactly reproducing the established order. To a large degree, the > dominant discourse represents the ladder of success in academic and research milieus where it establishes itself as a weapon used against those who praise the freedom of scientific inquiry and the free debate of ideas. . . . >
> Accordingly, we believe that a postmodernist critique of this > prevailing mode of thinking is indispensable. **Those who are wedded > to the idea of ‘evidence’ in the health sciences** maintain what is > essentially a Newtonian, mechanistic world view: they tend to believe > that reality is objective, which is to say that it exists, ‘out > there’, absolutely independent of the human observer, and of the > observer’s intentions and observations. They fondly point to ‘facts’, > while they are forced to dismiss ‘values’ as somehow unscientific. For > them, this reality (an ensemble of facts) corresponds to an > objectively real and mechanical world. But this form of empiricism, we > would argue, fetishises the object at the expense of the human > subject, for whom this world has a vital significance and meaning in > the first place. An evidence-based, empirical world view is > dangerously reductive insofar as it negates the personal and interpersonal significance and meaning of a world that is first and foremost a relational world, and not a fixed set of objects, partes extra partes. . . . >
> A starting point for health sciences would be to promote the > multiplicity of what Foucault describes as subjugated forms of > knowledge (savoirs assujettis): these forms of knowledge are ways of > understanding the world that are ‘disqualified as non-conceptual > knowledges, as insufficiently elaborated knowledges: naive knowledges, > hierarchically inferior knowledges, \[and\] knowledges that are below > the required level of erudition or scientificity’ (p. 7). These forms > of knowledge arise from below, as it were, in contradistinction to the > top-down approach that characterises the hegemonic thrust of EBHS. For Foucault, a subjugated knowledge is not the same thing as ‘common sense’. Instead, it is ‘a particular knowledge, a knowledge that is local, regional, or differential’ (pp. 7-8).

And, you know, a paper on linking Evidence-Based Medicine to Fascism simply wouldn’t be complete without a token quote from President George. W. Bush, but to find out how the authors make the linkage you’ll actually have to read the conclusion of the paper.
