Sperm competition, part n

[The incidence of superfecundation and of double paternity in the general population](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=7871943&dopt=Abstract):

> It is estimated that at least one dizygotic (DZ) twin maternity in > twelve is preceded by superfecundation (the fertilization of two ova > by sperm from different coitions). Presumably this parameter varies > from population to population eg. with coital rates and rates of > double ovulation. Sometimes superfecundation occurs by two different > men. The frequency with which this occurs must depend on rates of > infidelity (promiscuity). It is suggested that among DZ twins born to > married white women in the U.S., about one pair in 400 is bipaternal. > The incidence may be substantially higher in small selected groups of > dizygotic twin maternities, eg. those of women engaged in > prostitution.

[  
How frequent is heteropaternal superfecundation?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=1488855&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum):

> A newly discovered case of heteropaternal superfecundation (HS) is > reported. Three HS cases were found in a parentage test database of > 39,000 records. The frequency of HS among dizygotic twins whose > parents were involved in paternity suits is 2.4%. Although the study > population appears similar to the general population with respect to > twinning data, inferences about the frequency of HS in other > populations should be drawn with caution.
