Razib abroad

I will be in New York City between the 12th and 20th & Cambridge (Mass.) on the weekend of the 21st-22nd. I am planning on meeting up with some gnxp people already, but I am open getting together with other intelligent readers. If you are interested, email me at razibabroad – at – gmail.com….

Update: FYI, I plan on putting together a small cc: list and just setting up a ‘meet up’ style thing, probably somewhere in the lower half of Manhattan.
