Feather development in 3-D

Over the past 5 years Matthew Harris has been doing some interesting research into feather morphogenesis, and he has produced some [must watch videos](http://fallon.anatomy.wisc.edu/feather.html). His [work](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16087884&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum) on quantitative modeling of development via the activator-inhibitor system is, I believe, a necessary precursor in fruitfully talking about the evolutionary context of feathers. To my mind the videos are essential for anyone who isnâ€™t fluent in molecular developmental biology (like me), so we can have the big picture in mind when digging through the essential details.
