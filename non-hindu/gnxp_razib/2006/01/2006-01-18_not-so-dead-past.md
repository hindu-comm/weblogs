Not so dead past

Many [people](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/01/welcome_to_evolgen_at_scienceb.php#more) have been revisiting old posts so that new readers could get a “taste” of their blog. Below are some representative posts which span my varied interests….  
[Daughter of the Enlightenment](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003859.html), [Journey of Men](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000240.html), [The Germanization of the liberal Idea](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000419.html), [8th grade math for the rest of us](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/11/8th-grade-math-for-rest-of-us.php), [Gene expression might matter](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003595.html), [Slow and diverse food](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003932.html), [Up to medievalism](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001428.html), [Theological incorrectness](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/theological-incorrectness-when-people.php), [The madrassa & me](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001892.html), [Way of the Hui](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/08/way-of-hui.php), [Taste & behavior genetics](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003665.html), [Dissolving the dominance of dominance](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003868.html) , [Beyond the Punnett Square, part *n*](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/10/beyond-punnett-square-part-n.php), [Extremism in defense of precision is no vice](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/10/extremism-in-defense-of-precision-is.php) and [The gods of the cognitive scientists](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/gods-of-cognitive-scientists.php).  
I also mentioned to Chris Mims today that I suspect I’m the most “right wing” of the [Science Blogs](http://www.scienceblogs.com) recruits, and I decided to take a [Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org) test, which I do about once a year, and my results were predictable:  
**Economic Left/Right: 2.13  
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -2.67**  
You can see where I map [here](http://www.digitalronin.f2s.com/politicalcompass/printablegraph.php?ec=2.13&soc=-2.67). Though my answers have shifted over the years I always seem to end up to be a mild Right libertarian. But though the vector is pretty uniform, I have to say that its magnitude has been decreasing over the years as I have lost interest in politics.
