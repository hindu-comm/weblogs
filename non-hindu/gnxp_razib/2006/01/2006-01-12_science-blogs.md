Science blogs

An announcement, just wanted to tell people that I’ll be blogging a lot over at [Science Blogs](http://scienceblogs.com/), sponsored by Seed Magazine, soon. There is now an [iteration of gnxp](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) that will be hosted over there. After a few last minute technical details, there will be two streams of [gnxp](https://www.gnxp.com) on the web for you to keep track of. I wish I could tell you what this means, but I really don’t know, but imagine two subsets with a [non-trivial intersection](http://www.cs.uni.edu/%7Ecampbell/stat/venn2.gif). I’m not going to have a tried & true formula for what goes on over there vs. what goes over here (like [Evolgen](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2006/01/evolgen-jumps-shark.html)), we’ll see what evolves, so to speak. “Gene Expression” has developed as a group weblog with a specific personality over the last 3+ years, and I’ll try to craft a more individual “voice” with the Seed iteration.

Since I’m on semi-vacation in Brooklyn, that’s all I have to say now…more later.
