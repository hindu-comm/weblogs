Thermodynamics blog trial balloon

I recieved this email this morning re: thermodynamics:

I actually think that **basic physics and chemistry** are pretty important, so if someone is willing to start up a weblog on this topic and it finds a niche that isn’t already taken up in the ‘blogosphere’ I will certainly link immediately. But unlike something like evolutionary theory, cosmology or psychometrics I have had little long term success in keeping anyone’s attention on these topics in personal conversation since they often have no strong opinions *a priori* and are happy to stay that way.

Update: OK, the discussion on topic should move to [Phase Transitions](https://phase-transitions.blogspot.com/).
