Nuclear Waste Revisited

A while ago I posted on the old GNXP Politics board on the subject of nuclear waste. Among other things I said:

> the trump card of the objectors is that plutonium will still be > dangerous for millennia… Extraordinary (and costly) measures are > therefore needed to ensure that it cannot in any conceivable > circumstances leak out, even in the very distant future. This seems to > me wholly misconceived. It is absurd to worry about what may happen in > future millennia, but there are two broad alternatives. Either > civilisation will have collapsed, possibly due to nuclear war, in > which case a bit more plutonium will be the least of our descendants’ > worries. Or civilisation will have survived, in which case our > descendants will be able to look after themselves. The responsible > approach is not to bury plutonium inaccessibly deep in the ground, or in the ocean bed, but to keep it securely stored, in such a way that it can be dealt with by the appropriate authorities whenever they wish to, using future technologies we cannot yet imagine.

So naturally I was pleased to see an article in today’s (January 19) London **Times**, by their Science correspondant Nigel Hawkes, which includes the following:

> Forget the idea that we must produce a site safe for a million years > without human intervention… Setting the bar that high makes the best > an enemy of the good… What, people say, would happen to an engineered > burial site if mankind reverts to savagery and can no longer look > after it? That’s a stupid question. If man reverts to savagery, > nuclear waste in a deep hole in the ground will be the least of his > problems… We just need a strategy that makes it safe for a period of > history that falls within the human imagination. I reckon 200 years is enough. The store should be inaccessible to the malevolent but readily accessible to those responsible for curating the waste. It will be a legacy, but our descendants will be well able to cope.

Great minds think alike. Or something.
