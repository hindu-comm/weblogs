Beyond SNPs – Structural variation in the human genome

Nature Reviews Genetics has a review of the emerging evidence for massive amounts of [structural variation in the human genome](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n2/abs/nrg1767.html).

Abstract:

> The first wave of information from the analysis of the human genome > revealed SNPs to be the main source of genetic and phenotypic human > variation. However, the advent of genome-scanning technologies has now > uncovered an unexpectedly large extent of what we term ‘structural > variation’ in the human genome. This comprises microscopic and, more > commonly, submicroscopic variants, which include deletions, > duplications and large-scale copy-number variants – collectively > termed copy-number variants or copy-number polymorphisms – as well as > insertions, inversions and translocations. Rapidly accumulating > evidence indicates that structural variants can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility.

Summary:

> \* Structural variants in the human genome include cytogenetically detectable and submicroscopic deletions, duplications, large-scale copy-number variants, inversions and translocations.  
> \* The ability to detect and characterize structural variants in the 1-kb to 3-Mb size range in a robust manner across the genome has not been possible until recently.  
> \* New developments in genome-scanning technologies and computational methodologies, and the availability of a reference sequence for comparison, have made possible the large-scale discovery of structural variants.  
> \* Many studies are revealing that the total content of structural variants in the human genome could equal or exceed that of SNPs.  
> \* Structural variants often coincide with low-copy repeat DNA (also called segmental duplications), as these highly related sequences are more likely to undergo non-allelic recombination and subsequent rearrangement.  
> \* Structural variation in the genome can directly or indirectly influence gene dosage through different mechanisms, and therefore influence phenotypic variation and disease.  
> \* The cataloguing of structural variants and their frequencies in populations will be important for disease-mapping studies and for proper interpretation of clinical diagnostic-testing data.
