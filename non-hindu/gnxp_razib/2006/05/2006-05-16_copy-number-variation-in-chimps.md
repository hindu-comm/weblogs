Copy number variation in chimps

Don’t have much time to comment, but I thought I’d point you to pending paper in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/) (as usual, PNAS’ webmaster is slow in getting this out though the press release says it is on their website) which suggests [chimps have copy number variations similar to H. sapiens](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/asu-csr051506.php). The human genome is obviously interesting, but the recent focus on chimps too is obviously going to be important because to answer the question “what does it mean to be human?” it is good to have some perspective, and chimps are our nearest living relatives.
