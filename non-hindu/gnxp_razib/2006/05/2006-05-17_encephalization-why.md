Encephalization, why?

Between 3 million & 200,000 years ago the average cranial capacity of this planet’s dominant hominids increased along a upward trendline, in starts and stops. Bipedal apes went from having nearly chimp sized crania to one similar to modern human beings (Neandertals had larger brains that *H. sapiens sapiens*). Symbolic culture as we know it though seems to really ***explode*** (a.k.a. “The Great Leap Forward”) between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago. There have been many books on these issues. [The Mating Mind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038549517X/geneexpressio-20/102-2074290-6839350), [The Prehistory of the Mind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0500281009/geneexpressio-20/102-2074290-6839350) and [The Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471252522/geneexpressio-20/102-2074290-6839350?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2) hit many of the controversies from a popular angle. Nevertheless, *what do you think happened???* Was it climate change (I’m skeptical)? Was it some sort of cultural ratchet? Was it God?  
**Update:** Brown guacho has a [long post](http://www.indiancowboy.net/blog/?p=175) with graphs and pictures. Highly recommended.
