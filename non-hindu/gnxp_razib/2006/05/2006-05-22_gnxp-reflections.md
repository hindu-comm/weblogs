GNXP reflections

In less than two weeks GNXP [will be four](https://gnxp.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_gnxp_archive.html#85137052). A small little weblog that started out at 300 uniques per day in the summer of 2002 is now steady at 3,000 per day in 2006 (and, has spawned a [spin off weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp)). We’ve been [\#1 for gene expression](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gene+expression&btnG=Google+Search) on google for a while now, and have slipped on to the second page for the [gene](https://www.google.com/search?q=gene&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N) query. We’ve grown at a slower clip than the rest of the blogosphere over the past few years, but what we lack in quantity of readers I suspect we make up for in quality. In any case, I’ve bullied Jason Malloy into writing some sort of retrospective by June 2nd, since he remembers “the blog” before there was a blog (when Godless Capitalist and I had our own places on the web), and tends to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all things GNXP. If you have stories & anecdotes that might spice up the post, drop them in the comment boxes. Especially old commenters who have gone into hibernation (though people reemerge, like bbartlog).

Also, I’d like to welcome JP, Darth Quixote and MC Coffee Mug into the stable. For those of you who are a bit older, I imagine this is going to be a “triple threat” like Jordan, Pippen or Kukoc, or Bird, McHale and Parish, deep into the future.
