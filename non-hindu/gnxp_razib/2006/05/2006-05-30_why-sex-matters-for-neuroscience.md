"Why sex matters for neuroscience"

Excellent review of the latest findings on sex influences and brain anatomy/functioning by [Larry Cahill](http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/neurobio/Faculty/Cahill/cahill.htm) over at Nature Reviews – Neuroscience \[[open access](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v7/n6/full/nrn1909.html)\]. One comment from Cahill:

> A third, also related, misconception holds that the differences within > a sex are much more substantial than those between the sexes, the > implication being that sex influences can therefore be dismissed as > trivial.

Now, [where](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001525.html) have I heard this (sort of) argument before…?
