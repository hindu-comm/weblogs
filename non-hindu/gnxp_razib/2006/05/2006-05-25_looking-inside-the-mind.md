Looking inside the mind‚Ä¶.

I had a strange experience the other day. I was walking down a hallway, and all of a sudden the name of a local software company came to mind. I didn‚Äôt understand why I was thinking about this, and I was mulling over this strange issue when 20 seconds after I‚Äôd started thinking about the company in question, a woman to my right nodded in my direction (she was a few people over). And bingo, all of a sudden I realized why I‚Äôd been thinking about that company, the woman was the roommate of another individual who I knew worked at that company. The peculiar thing is that it is clear that one part of my mind (‚Äúhuman recognition‚Äù) realized who the individual out of the corner of my field of vision was, and somehow that triggered cogitation about a software company that I associated with this individual. But, my conscious mind was totally unaware of this until after the fact.  
Anyway, it was pretty strange at the time, though perhaps I could conclude I have psychic powers and my prescience about the relationship of this individual who was going to get my attention was simply a way of my mind of priming me. I don‚Äôt know üôÇ
