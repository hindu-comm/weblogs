Global Beauties "rankings"

[The Grand Slam Ranking](http://www.globalbeauties.com/gsr.htm) for the [Global Beauties](http://www.globalbeauties.com/) site takes the 4 international beauty pageants and generates a composite “score.” I’ve [dismissed faux precision](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/uc_davis_1_ecology_evolution_p.php) before, but admitted that it can be quite fun. I was going to generate some excel charts for you (e.g., plot population vs. score), but I really don’t have time so I’ll leave it to readers with more minutes to burn than I. Also, as expected, the Harvard of beauty pageants, Venezuela, is \#1. Just to generate some controversy, I’ve always noticed a tendency for China to not represent, considering that there are a 500 million Chinese females \[and counting down thanks to infanticide, abortion and neglect\]. I also think some of you might find the links to [regional/national pageants interesting](http://www.globalbeauties.com/links.htm). It is amusing to me that the world’s only state where Hinduism is the official religion, and the constitution states that the monarch must of “Aryan” heritage, puts forward contestants than [look so “Asian”](http://www.missnepal.com.np/contestants.php). While some of these women look conventially [north Indian](http://www.missnepal.com.np/soniya.php), while as expected contestants from [Tibetan ethnicities](http://www.missnepal.com.np/baby.php) look [Tibetan](http://www.missnepal.com.np/chandra.php), some with [north Indian names](http://www.missnepal.com.np/sushila.php) look [mostly East Asian](http://www.missnepal.com.np/mohini.php). And of course you have the [“mixed”](http://www.missnepal.com.np/hema.php) look which seems typical from what I have seen.
