These papers are so HOTT right now!

I was poking around looking for something else and found this [ESI special topics website](http://www.esi-topics.com/). It updates every other month and provides interviews with the authors of the most highly cited papers at the time. I really think the “fronts” are interesting and could be useful. They give you a map of journal articles that seem to be forming a cluster and generating excitement within a certain field. Here’s one for [hippocampal GABA(A)](http://esi-topics.com/erf/maps/april2005-map.html) receptors.

I’m hoping they do a map for the RNA decapping and degradation since they have identified it as a Fast Moving Front. They have an interview with Roy Parker about P-bodies and RNA degradation [here](http://esi-topics.com/fmf/2006/may06-RoyParker.html). I’ve done a little bit on the topic [before](http://thegenius.typepad.com/the_genius/2006/03/the_decapping_c.html). The hot topic in the social sciences is apparently “[Democracy](http://www.esi-topics.com/erf/maps/april2006-map.html)“. So check it out. ESI special topics: from Decapping to Democracy.
