The Dumb Vinci Code

At my other blog…[I post](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/why_the_dumb_vinci_code_matter.php) about why *The Da Vinci Code* is important (unfortunately). Also, [a quick introduction](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/05/kinship_theory_and_genomic_imp.php) to David Haig’s kinship theory hypothesis re: genomic imprinting.
