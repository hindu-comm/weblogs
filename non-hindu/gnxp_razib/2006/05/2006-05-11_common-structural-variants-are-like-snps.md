Common structural variants are like SNPs

Three papers in the January issue of Nature genetics, [“Common deletions and SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium in the human genome”](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n1/abs/ng1695.html), [“Common deletion polymorphisms in the human genome”](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n1/abs/ng1696.html) and [“A high-resolution survey of deletion polymorphism in the human genome”](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n1/abs/ng1697.html) each examine common structural variation in the human genome.

A number of papers have previously reported that intermediate-scale “structural” (e.g. insertions, deletions, rearrangements) variations “are prevalent enough to be an important source of genetic variation between individuals”. One question was whether these intermediate-sized variations occured once during human history and shared by descent (like most SNPs) or whether they are like a class of recurring mutations that delete, insert or rearrange large portions of the genome and subseqently cause disease.

The Perlegen paper gives the best summary:

> common deletions and SNPs ascertained with similar criteria have > essentially the same distribution of linkage disequilibrium with > surrounding SNPs, indicating that these polymorphisms may share > evolutionary history and that most deletion polymorphisms are > effectively assayed by proxy in SNP-based association studies.
