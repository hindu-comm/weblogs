Ask a Science Blogger, know how to know!

This weeks “Ask a Science Blogger” question is:  
**“If you could shake the public and make them understand one scientific idea, what would it be?”**  
I assume others will answer this also, so I want to get this out first: my reply is that the public needs to know that the most important idea about “science” is that it is not about ideas, but it is a **way of getting to those ideas through a specific way of thinking about the world and interacting with your fellow human**. Science is the *means*, not the *ends*. And, that means is a synthesis of a set of heuristics mediated by a particular social context which is at the terminus of a path of cultural development. Rules like falsification are important, but they are irrelevant outside of the context of a group of peers who seek to discover the truth about the world as it is. The scientific community is important, but that community flourishes best in a *roughly* liberal culture (see the destruction wrought upon Russian genetics by [Lysenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism)). Finally, the set of rules must include in appropriate dosages elements of rationalism (*a priori* model building and hypothesis formation), empiricism (experimentation) and skepticism (an analysis of the rigor of the models constructed and the data collected).
