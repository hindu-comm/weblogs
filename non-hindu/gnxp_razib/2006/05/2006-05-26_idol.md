Idol

I don’t know [what to think](http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyid=2006-05-25T223553Z_01_N2555364_RTRUKOC_0_US-LEISURE-TELEVISION.xml&src=rss&rpc=22) about this year’s idol winner, but hey, perhaps he won’t be a closeted gay man always in image control mode because of his “secret” (not that there’s anything wrong with that!). As for the runner up, best of luck to her, I know how it feels….
