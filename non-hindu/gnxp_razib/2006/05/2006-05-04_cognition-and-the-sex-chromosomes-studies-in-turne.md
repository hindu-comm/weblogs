Cognition and the sex chromosomes: studies in Turner syndrome

[Cognition and the sex chromosomes: studies in Turner syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16397401&amp;query_hl=18&itool=pubmed_docsum):

> Turner syndrome (TS) is a human genetic disorder involving females who > lack all or part of one X chromosome…The cognitive phenotype generally > includes normal verbal function with relatively impaired > visual-spatial ability, attention, working memory, and spatially > dependent executive function….Careful clinical and molecular > characterization of adult subjects missing part of Xp links the TS > phenotype of impaired visual spatial/perceptual ability to specific > distal Xp chromosome regions. We demonstrate that small, nonmosaic > deletion of the distal short arm of the X chromosome in adult women is > associated with the same hallmark cognitive profile seen in adult > women with TS. Future studies will elucidate the cognitive deficits > and the underlying etiology.
