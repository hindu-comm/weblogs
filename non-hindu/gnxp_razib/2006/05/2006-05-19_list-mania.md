List-mania

My attempt to solicit a narrow and eminent list of evolutionary biologists for my planned attempt at rolling my own quizilla at some point in the future really got out of control. On the one hand, **the discipline was too broadly construed**. Biases creep in. On the other hand, **the category was too narrow in that many scientists contributed to evolutionary biology without being evolutionary biologists** (most trivally G.H. Hardy). Since many readers of this weblog are highly credentialized in some particular field, I invite all to:  
1) State a category where you know your shit (e.g., “evolutionary developmental biology of three-toed sloths”)  
2) Your list of “top 10”  
The intent is dual, first, just for fun, second, it might be a nice resource for me to explore some literature in territory I’m not that familiar with….  
**Update:** Brown gaucho [elaborates](http://www.indiancowboy.net/blog/?p=181). Anyone who posts something that is not-spam in the comments will get linked too…. (if you don’t have a credential, make one up). It’s the blogosphere….
