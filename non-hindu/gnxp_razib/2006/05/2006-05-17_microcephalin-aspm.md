Microcephalin & ASPM

[Brain size not linked to Microcephalin and ASPM?](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/uoc--ibs051606.php). [Normal Variants of Microcephalin and ASPM Do Not Account for Brain Size Variability](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/ddl126v1):

> Normal human brain volume is heritable. The genes responsible for > variation in brain volume are not known. Microcephalin (MCPH1) and > ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) have been > proposed as candidate genes since mutations in both genes are > associated with microcephaly and common variants of each gene are > apparently under strong positive selective pressure. In 120 normal > subjects, we genotyped these variants and measured brain volumes using > magnetic resonance imaging. We found no evidence that the selected > alleles were associated with increases or decreases in brain volume. **This result suggests that the selective pressure on these genes may be related to subtle neurobiological effects or to their expression outside the brain**.
