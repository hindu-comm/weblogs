Online integrity

I [saw this](https://cityofbrass.blogspot.com/2006/05/online-integrity-statement-of.html) at Aziz’s blog and [I signed up](http://onlineintegrity.org/?p=5). It is something of an empty gesture for me because I rarely get into the personal disputes with other bloggers, though this was more semi-common in the first few years of this weblog’s existence. But who knows, if there was more tension about the Wright-Fisher controversies perhaps I’d be getting down & dirty too. But I’m all for people behaving less like animals, so I signed up (OK, I mean emotional animals, something sedate like a ground sloth is tolerable because it is ignorable).
