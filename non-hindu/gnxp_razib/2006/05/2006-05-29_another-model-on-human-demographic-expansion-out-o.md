Another model on human demographic expansion out of Africa

The American Journal of Human Genetics has a paper in its [pre-print section](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/preprints.epl) titled “A geographically explicit genetic model of worldwide human settlement history.” I quickly skimmed it (and [uploaded it into the GNXP forum](http://f5.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/YN97RHP7i8VyrowzH42fLG7FQqCmzil_9k5fYf7ZJvWwu9BfZhFwYvg-NQkYJU6GImI9LgSr73gR8UbchjxqFA/AJHG43550.preprint.pdf)). I have serious issues some of the inferences made in regards to the “obvious” fit of such coalescence data with a particular demographic history. I am convinced that [meta-population dynamics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15757241&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum) tend to be ignored (in part because they are just another complication) even though they can also explain the data. Nevertheless, this jumped out at me:

As I stated above, meta-population dynamics, local extinctions and recolonizations, are issues that the authors seem to ignore when it comes to ignore their there results, especially given that environmental parameters are likely to be very relevant to marginal groups. They even allude to what seems like an abortive extra-African colonization in the Levant by anatomically modern *H. sapiens sapiens* which ended in local population extinction. But, the idea that humans are *relatively* buffered from environmental variation is roughly correct, and I’m talking about “humans” in a very broad sense. Our genus, Homo, broke out of the African continent almost immediately after its genesis. Dmanisi [shows that](http://www.dmanisi.org.ge/paleoanthropology.htm) beyond a shadow of a doubt.
