Mathematicians and biology

Evolgen has an [interesting post](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/04/this_is_what_passes_for_entert.php) about going to a math department seminar where the topic was genomics. He goes over some questions mathematicians had about biology and their misconceptions. I don’t know…I talked to a woman this January who has an undergraduate math degree, and she told her boyfriend (a friend of mine) that she was surprised that biology could be interesting!
