They have been practicing for 40,000 years….

Dienekes has [an abstract](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/04/deep-mitochondrial-origin-of.html) of a [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16596590&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum) out which suggests that the mtDNA lineages of some Australian Aboriginals can be traced back 40,000 years. Now remember, this is mtDNA only…looking at the mtDNA in East Anglia might suggest lighter influx of Saxons from Germany than Y chromosomal lineages. Not a big deal, but it can be hard to get details about the genetics of Australian Aboriginals sometimes.
