From physics to philosophy

Over at [my other blog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/physicists_vs_biologists_cogni.php) I offer opinions as to the reality that [physicists are more intelligent than biologists](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/physicists_vs_biologists_cogni.php) when it comes to *g* (I wouldn’t be surprised if theoretical physicists weren’t the best when it comes to eye-hand coordination, but I won’t hold that against them). My rough conclusion is that if you had a math olympics between the average physicists and biologists obviously the physicists would wipe the floor with the latter, but, since the raw number of biologists is so large if you had to assemble an “all star team” the biologists might be able to compete because the sample space of possibilities is so much larger.

But that’s not what this post is about. I barely skimmed the other test score [averages from ETS](http://ftp.ets.org/pub/gre/994994.pdf), but I did note that the highest verbal and analytical writing scores were from people intending to major in philosophy. I found that kind of interesting.
