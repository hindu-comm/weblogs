Humans and chimps & bitter taste = convergent evolution

From Nature, [Independent evolution of bitter-taste sensitivity in humans and chimpanzees](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7086/abs/nature04655.html):

> It was reported over 65 years ago that chimpanzees, like humans, vary > in taste sensitivity to the bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide > (PTC)1. This was suggested to be the result of a shared balanced > polymorphism…In humans, variable PTC sensitivity is largely controlled > by the segregation of two common alleles at the TAS2R38 locus…Here we > show that PTC taste sensitivity in chimpanzees is also controlled by > two common alleles of TAS2R38; however, neither of these alleles is > shared with humans…Association testing of PTC sensitivity in a cohort > of captive chimpanzees confirmed that chimpanzee TAS2R38 genotype > accurately predicts taster status in vivo. Therefore, although Fisher > et al.’s observations1 were accurate, their explanation was wrong. > **Humans and chimpanzees share variable taste sensitivity to bitter > compounds mediated by PTC receptor variants, but the molecular basis > of this variation has arisen twice, independently, in the two > species**.
