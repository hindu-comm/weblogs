Tom Hanks is married to a Muslim!

OK, not really. But, I saw in my RSS that Dienekes’ weblog has a [post](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/) on the religion of famous celebrities and it said Tom Hanks is “Greek Orthodox.” This piqued my interest, and I found out that Tom Hanks is “Orthodox” via marriage to Rita Wilson, born [Margarita Ibrahimoff](https://imdb.com/name/nm0001854/bio), who is Greek Orthodox. Wikipedia says that her father is a Bulgarian Pomak and her mother is Greek, and I’m willing to credit this because the name Ibrahimoff strongly suggests Muslim antecedants. [Pomaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomak) you see are Slavic speaking Muslim minorities in the Balkans (as opposed to Turks, who do not speak the local language as their native tongue). Obviously Wilson was raised in her mother’s religion, but according to Islam you are Muslim if your father is, and since her father was Muslim…well, let’s just make sure Tom doesn’t take Rita to Afghanistan anytime soon!
