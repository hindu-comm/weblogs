Paternity confidence paper finally published

Via Dienekes, [Study explores how accurately men gauge paternity](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-04/uocp-dfk040406.php). The paper itself, [How well does paternity confidence match actual paternity? Evidence from worldwide nonpaternity rates](http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/A/Kermyt.G.Anderson-1/papers/abs_patconf1.html), has been available in preprint form for a while now. I mention it here in part because it can sometimes be difficult to track down the reference in our archives. The paper seems to point to the reality that [type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_error) (false positive) seems common when it comes to suspicion of paternity, but honestly, 1-2% rates of [type II error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_error) isn’t all that reassuring to many men I suspect. As the post-genomic era advances it seems plausible that routine screens of families for genetic predispositions are going to put professionals in sticky ethical situations, though I assume they would keep any pattern of glaring genomic discordances to themselves….
