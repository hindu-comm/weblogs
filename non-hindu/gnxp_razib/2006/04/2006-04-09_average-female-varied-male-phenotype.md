Average female/varied male phenotype

To google with love, from godless capitalist:

> Molecular mechanism \[reduced female variance\] is most likely [barr-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barr_body) mediated mosaicism in female somatic cells. I’ve seen some data in the past that points to this. >
> In other words, the random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in each cell means that females experience “averaging”. >
> Males have only one X chromosome, and do not experience this averaging. >
> As the X chromosome has lots of transcription factors (as one might expect), the simple averaging of dosage levels and so on between cells via random X inactivation is likely to reduce phenotypic variance for most characteristics.
