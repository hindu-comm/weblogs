Skin color & sexual selection

In the [GNXP Forum](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gnxpforum/files/) I have placed a PDF titled [skincolorsexual.pdf](http://f3.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cDFHRI_2l5oOZdz0qbhShN0nrJ7a6pYRTQGtsz1nWe5pxSHd5EwN3MW4Ka4Pl3KtKYlxrLO2Nu_1q3L4A5jZYA/skincolorsexual.pdf). It is the full PDF of [Sexual Selection as a cause of human skin color variation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12573076&dopt=Abstract):

> The dark skin of tropical peoples is likely to be an adaptation to the > strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation near the equator, perhaps protecting > against sunburn or degradation of folate. By contrast, the adaptive > value of light skin is questionable. In particular, the relevance of > vitamin D deficiency rickets as a selective factor has been cogently > criticized. Population genetic studies on the melanocortin 1 receptor > (MC1R) gene (one of the genes responsible for normal human skin colour > variation) also cast doubt on the role of positive natural selection > in the evolution of light skin. Natural selection may favour dark skin > everywhere, though to a lesser extent at higher latitudes. Darwin > believed that racial differences in skin colour were caused by sexual > selection. Available evidence suggests that in each society a > lighter-than-average skin colour is preferred in a sexual partner. > Such a preference would generate sexual selection for light skin that counteracts natural selection for dark skin. The observed latitudinal gradient in skin colour may result from the balance between natural and sexual selection.

Since Iâ€™ve put the full paper online, **I suggest people actually read it before they comment** (\*hint\*).
