Living Neandertals & another idea about the Hobbits

Just a note for those of you who don’t read [my other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/), Greg Cochran has two new ideas that we’re trying to guess at. First, he’s got a new theory about the origin/evolution about the Hobbits of Flores. Second, he thinks it might be a *possibility* that there are living Neandertals. Anyway, I’m throwing this out there because I won’t be too surprised if Greg can convince Nick Wade to write a story in the Grey Lady about this stuff at some point in the near future….
