Hot chicks and rubbernecking

Tara at [Aetiology](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/04/bikinis_make_macho_men_stupid.php) has a [post](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2006/04/bikinis_make_macho_men_stupid.php) about pictures of hot chicks making masculine guys less prone to be hard-asses. This might fall into the “and someone funded this research???” category. Nevertheless, I have two stories to recount about “hot” chicks which readers might find amusing.

First, a few years ago a friend of mine was in the passenger seat of a van that was passing by one of the bridges that cross the Willamette from the east to the west side of Portland. He noted that a young joggeress was making her way to the bridge, and watched as a man in a truck rubbernecked to the point where he didn’t notice that there was a car in front of him in the intersection. His truck and the car in the intersection he should have stopped for crashed perpendicularly into each other. My friend saw the whole thing go down, and he leaned over to the driver’s side and said to his friend, “That chick just caused a crash!” His friend was like, “Yeah, she could, couldn’t she?” Turns out he was rubbernecking the whole time and didn’t even notice the crash! I asked if the chick was hot, and my friend was like, “It’s Portland, of course not.”

Another story concerns myself. I was on the road with a friend and we were in a town with very few attractive chicks. Then, across the street I spied someone of considerable pulchritude, so as I walked on my side of the street my eyes were tracking her…and I ran into a tree!
