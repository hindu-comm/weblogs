Most influential science book in my life….

*Seed* has a new in house weblog, [Stochastic](http://scienceblogs.com/seed/), and our resident intern Katherine Sharpe is asking about the [best science books for laypeople](http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2006/04/the_best_science_books_ever.php)…which would be a *long* list. But, I can unhesitantly offer the most influential science book in terms of making me explore many domains of the natural sciences and their intersection with our species’ history and social development: [Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345331354/geneexpressio-20/), by Carl Sagan.
