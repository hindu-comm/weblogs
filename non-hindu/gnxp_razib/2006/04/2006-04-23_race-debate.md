Race debate

John Wilkins [started a debate on race](https://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2006/04/races-geography-and-genetic-clusters.html). I responded [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/race.php) & [here](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/race_ii.php). John responds to the [response](https://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2006/04/some-more-on-race.html). Interesting discussion threads on Pharyngula, [here](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/that_question_of_race.php) & [here](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/pester_wilkins.php). [The Contingency](https://contingencytable.blogspot.com/) Table adds his [2 cents](https://contingencytable.blogspot.com/2006/04/race-useful-concept.html). You all know about this topic, but I figured you might want pointers to the “discussion.” I’ve stated at least twice that I’m an [instrumentalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism) on this issue, here is the definition from Wiki:

> In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that > concepts and theories are merely useful instruments whose worth is measured not by whether the concepts and theories are true or false (or correctly depict reality), but by how effective they are in explaining and predicting phenomena.

For the record, I’m close to an instrumentalist on the “species concept” debate too.

Update: My [last response](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/04/unity_in_diversity.php) to [John’s last response](https://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2006/04/last-one-on-race.html). Evolgen also [offers his 2 cents](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/04/race_or_whatever_1.php).
