Gene expression isn’t that different

A [review paper](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02868.x) worth checking out in *Molecular Ecology*, [Variation within and among species in gene expression: raw material for evolution](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02868.x). The salient bit:

> We find: (i) microarray-based measures of gene expression are precise > given appropriate experimental design; (ii) there is large > inter-individual variation, which is composed of a minor nongenetic > component and a large heritable component; (iii) variation among > populations and species appears to be affected primarily by neutral > drift and stabilizing selection, and to a lesser degree by directional selection; and (iv) neutral evolutionary divergence in gene expression becomes nonlinear with greater divergence times due to functional constraint.

In [Darwin’s Dangerous Idea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068482471X/geneexpressio-20/) Daniel Dennett contended that selection is “substrate neutral.” If that is so than the wide open realm of gene regulation and differential expression is going to be a twist on a familiar theme.
