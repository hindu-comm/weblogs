Gene expression makes the man

[Most Human-Chimp Differences Due to Gene Regulation – Not Genes](http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/518530/). I don’t know if this is *news*, but it reiterates a trend that will continue as a deeper understanding of how genes express themselves, and regulatory pathways, are explored in greater detail. The paper, Expression profiling in primates reveals a rapid evolution of human transcription factors, is out in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/index.html) tomorrow. If natural selection is a “substrate neutral” algorithmic process (or “stochastic hill climbing”), does it really matter if it is selecting from a range of regulatory switches vs. alternative sequences?

**Update:** Evolgen has [much more](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/03/evolution_of_gene_expression_i.php).
