Dinosaurs of a feather don’t flock together?

A [recent story](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=0001F3E8-93DE-1418-93DE83414B7F0000) of a non-feathered dinosaur in a presumably feathered clade is stirring the pot a bit right now. The importance of [shared derived characters](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Shared_derived_characters.asp) in systematics is one reason that something like feathers tends to elicit a response from many scientists, since one character might result in the reworking of the tree of life. But there are other ways to study feathers aside from paleontology, in particular, I point you to the work of [Richard Prum](http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pubs.htm) (in particular, [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16208685&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum)) and [Matthew Harris](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16087884&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum). Development and genetics can be crucial supplements to the fossil evidence in this case, though dinosaurs are no longer around, birds and the crocodilian [outgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgroup) are.
