Nick Wade, genetics & history

Nick Wade’s [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/weekinreview/12wade.html?ex=1299819600&en=4dfa8518bf6db229&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) on history, genetics and human evolution is out. John McNeill says:

> John McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University, said that “it > should be no surprise to anyone that human nature is not a constant” > and that selective pressures have probably been stronger in the last > 10,000 years than at any other epoch in human evolution. Genetic > information could therefore have a lot to contribute, although only a > minority of historians might make use of it, he said.

McNeill coauthored [The Human Web](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039305179X/geneexpressio-20/) with his father a few years ago, and it was a pretty good interdisciplinary survey. I am not surprised that McNeill was the historian that Wade looked to for a quote. Money shot from Greg:

> “Since it looks like there has been significant evolutionary change > over historical time, we’re going to have to rewrite every history > book ever written,” said Gregory Cochran, a population geneticist at > the University of Utah. “The distribution of genes influencing > relevant psychological traits must have been different in Rome than it > is today,” he added. “The past is not just another country but an > entirely different kind of people.”

**Update:** So, [Brad DeLong](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/03/mutants.html) has a hyper-simplistic post where he “refutes” Greg and Pritchard’s contentions. Here is a case where simple models become very appealing when it supports your own prior beliefs…all of a sudden various interactional, environmental and other forces that buffet the frequency of one allele become irrelevant.
