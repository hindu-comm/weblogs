"The liberal baby bust"

I listened to [“The Demographics of Liberalism”](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5288004) on NPR, and noted a striking similarity between Phillip Longman’s conclusions and those of Steve Sailer’s [Baby Gap](http://www.amconmag.com/2004_12_06/cover.html) research.

[More from Longman in USA Today.](http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-03-13-babybust_x.htm)

The main difference between Sailer and Longman appears to be their audiences.

While you’re chewing on that, I wanted to pose a question: what could tax policy do to promote “eugenic” (for lack of a better word) reproductive trends? ([Partial inspiration for this question.](http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=341&Itemid=6))
