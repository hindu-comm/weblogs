Teaching the Blind to Drive

When some school administrators say that all students have the same potential, they evidently really do believe this to be true. How else to explain this report from the [Chicago Tribune:](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0603100180mar10,1,7954861.story?coll=chi-news-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true)

Notice the ass-covering going on here. For years, blind students have had to enroll in this class and this isn’t news to the school officials, yet they’re saying that they’d be willing to modify the requirements if only some parent would step forward and battle the school bureaucracy and “make a good case” for exempting blind students from learning how to drive. Why even the teacher thinks it’s a great idea to teach blind students how to read road signs translated into braille.

In other [education news](http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO15703/), if you’re a college professor don’t view porn on the computer monitor while teaching your class, especially if your monitor is twinned to an overhead projection system.
