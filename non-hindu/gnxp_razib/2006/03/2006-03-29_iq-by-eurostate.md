IQ by Eurostate

In a flashback to the [IQ by state hoax](http://www.isteve.com/IQhoax.htm), the Times has published [a list of IQs by country](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2105519,00.html) for most, but not all, European countries. The ranking is attributed to Richard Lynn, without references.

The IQ range of 107 (Germany) to 89 (Serbia) resembles [real IQ by US state data](http://www.isteve.com/04NovB.htm#vet86).

Razib whispers: Beware of British newspapers!!!
