A method and a culture

Some of the Science Bloggers are coming up with taxonomies of [biologists](http://scienceblogs.com/transcript/2006/03/listen_up_all_you.php), [physicists](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/03/taxons_wanted.php) and [anthropologists](http://scienceblogs.com/afarensis/2006/03/22/taxonomy_of_anthropology_revis/) and [chemists](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/03/in_the_case_that_we_need_a_gee.php). This is great, and I don’t have anything to add except that it is always important to remember that **science the method is irrelevant without the science the culture**. It itself is embedded within the broader culture, and as books like [The Lunar Men](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374528888/geneexpressio-20) show science’s growth and efflorescence are tied together with currents that sweep through the broad expanse of a society. Attempts at “modernization” of a “traditional” culture via science as in the 19th century Egypt of [Muhammad Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt) failed because science is likely less an engine of “modernity” than a product of it.
