Dan Dennett on Radio Open Source

Dan Dennett will be on *Radio Open Source* [today](http://www.radioopensource.org/is-god-in-our-genes/) to talk about his book [Breaking the Spell](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067003472X/geneexpressio-20/102-4217346-1892104). I’ve been getting into it on [the comment boards](http://www.radioopensource.org/is-god-in-our-genes/#comments).  
**Update:** Re: Dennett’s book, I read it. It is a good review of the literature, though I *highly recommend* you go straight into the primary sources (though for Rod Stark, stick to [A Theory of Religion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0813523303/geneexpressio-20/), it is dry compared to his other stuff, but far less polemical and grating).  
**Related:** The nature of religion and *Breaking the Spell*, Who Dan Denett think he be foolin’?.
