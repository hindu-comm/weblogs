Amusing stuff

Nothing big enough for its own post, just a bunch of things that caught my attention:

PLoS Genetics: [AVPR1a and SLC6A4 Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Creative Dance Performance](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010042)

> We therefore hypothesize that the association between AVPR1a and SLC6A4 reflects the social communication, courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype rather than other aspects of this complex phenotype, such as sensorimotor integration.

PLoS Medicine: [Are Racial and Ethnic Minorities Less Willing to Participate in Health Research?](http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030019) Nope.

TSC: [The Stone Age Trinity](http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=030606D) wherein a libertarian realizes that humans have an egalitarian *instincts* which will get in the way of a libertarian society.

TNR: [Blue State Blues](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20060403&s=diarist040306) — Criticizing “red state snobbery”, Jonathan Chait writes “I wonder if Wolfe and his fellow travelers realize how much their mau-mauing of blue staters is, well, Maoist.” — Ironic new meaning of “Red state”.
