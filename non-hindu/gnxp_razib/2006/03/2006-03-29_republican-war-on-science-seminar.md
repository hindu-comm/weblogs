Republican War on Science – Seminar

Crooked Timber has done a [web seminar on Chris Mooney’s Republican War on Science](http://crookedtimber.org/category/chris-mooney-seminar/)

I was especially happy to see John Holbo’s piece, [“Mooney Minus the Polemic?”](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/03/27/mooney-minus-the-polemic/), which points out the exception of science friendly libertarians and their own disdain for the liberal abuses of science:

> \[hypothetical libertarian soliloquy:\] Liberals are the ones who are > always refusing to look at the facts. Look what they did to poor Larry > Summers because he tried to speak truth to power! They buried their heads in the sand when The Bell Curve came out! Whimpering “frankenfood.” Postmodern nonsense! What the academy needs is a return to reason!

The comments thread of [“The Stars and Stripes Down to Earth (posted for Daniel Davies by HF)”](http://crookedtimber.org/2006/03/27/the-stars-and-stripes-down-to-earth-posted-for-daniel-davies-by-hf/) includes some suggestions re: a Democratic war on science along the same lines.

Overall, Chris \[[link to his site at ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/)\] does a good job of handling the criticism.
