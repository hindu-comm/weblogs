The throwback canard

By now some of you have [heard of the family that walks on all fours](https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&ncl=http://www.nbc10.com/irresistible/7815702/detail.html). I got a tip on this story weeks ago from [World Science](http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060306_reversfrm.htm), which has been tracking this for a while and has a [new update](http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/060306_reversfrm.htm) from a researcher that says this is a “credible” empirical finding. I didn’t really intend to post about this for the following reasons:  
1) **A high probability that it is a hoax**. The British media was the first mainstream organ to really take off with this, and they aren’t known for their scientific credibility (*Nature*, *The Daily Telegraph* is not). Additionally, the findings are coming out of the heart of Central Anatolia, and so are relatively hard to check for most Western scientists. Nevertheless, [Carl Zimmer](http://loom.corante.com/archives/2006/03/08/this_week_in_human_evolution.php) has *many* more details, including a comment from one of the scientists in question who have seen this family first hand, which suggests this is probably not a hoax to the first order.  
2) **The packaging of this as an “atavism” or “reverse evolution” is ridiculous**. Evolution does not move along one highway, ascending the [Great chain of Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_being) (nor do I believe the canals are infinite, rather, there are a wide range of stable states I suspect). Bipedalism is probably not a trait that emerged fully formed from the head of Zeus. This family, if they are not the [Tasaday](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A726653) of our day, are likely a pathology of some sort. One can get to the same phenotype (non-bipedalism) in a variety of ways. It seems that there are a host of deleterious correlated traits associated with this family (Carl mentions retardation), if this non-bipedalism was highly adaptive one assumes that over time modifier genes would crop up that would mask the deleterious side effects of the allele of large effect.  
3) **The appeal of this story, and its legs, suggest what people *really* find important**. And, I think it shows why [saltationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltation_%28biology%29) will always have staying power as a hypothesis, there is public demand for it!
