No cheat left behind

[Seems like](http://www.twincities.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/new_jersey/14186177.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp) a Jersey principal was instructed to cheat on state tests.

> Principal Joseph Carruth was riding down the slow, paneled elevator at Camden’s district office, ready to cave in to pressure from a superior who he says had just given him a tutorial on how to cheat on state tests. >
> “My head is spinning,” Carruth recounted to The Inquirer of his feelings that day in January 2005. “I can’t believe it.” >
> Still green on the job at Camden’s Dr. Charles E. Brimm Medical Arts High, Carruth needed medical benefits for his ill daughter. He did not have tenure. He was tempted to take whatever steps necessary to keep his job. >
> “I was thinking, ‘How can I do it?’ ” Carruth said about that day. “And then it’s, like, ‘What are you doing? You can’t do this.’ “

Good thing the cheater was caught, so that this thing won’t ever happen again.

ADDENDUM: From [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey#Demographics) on Camden:

> The racial makeup of the city was 16.84% White, 53.35% Black or > African American, 0.54% Native American, 2.45% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 22.83% from other races, and 3.92% from two or more races. 38.82% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 8.9% are foreign-born.
