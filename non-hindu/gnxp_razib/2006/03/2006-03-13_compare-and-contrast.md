Compare and contrast

So, Brad DeLong posits a [very simple model](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/03/mutants.html) to refute the idea of natural selection within the last 10,000 years. But this doesn’t work, models are [context dependent](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/04/07/lucus-a-non-lucendo/#comment-24196). Evolutionary psychology can’t work, except when it can. And so on.

Update: Just to make it clear, the point of the post was to show how plausible or implausible simple models become depending on where you stand on a given issue. As [I’ve noted before](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/metaphors-analogies-we-dont-live-by.php), your political or social stance strongly colors the perceived utility of a model where many parameters are left explicitly unaccounted for.
