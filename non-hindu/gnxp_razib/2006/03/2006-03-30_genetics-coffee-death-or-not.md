Genetics + coffee = death…or…not

Interesting paper out in *JAMA*, [Coffee, CYP1A2 genotype, and risk of myocardial infarction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16522833&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_docsum):

> The association between coffee intake and risk of myocardial > infarction (MI) remains controversial. Coffee is a major source of > caffeine, which is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 1A2 > (CYP1A2) enzyme. Individuals who are homozygous for the CYP1A2\*1A > allele are “rapid” caffeine metabolizers, whereas carriers of the > variant CYP1A2\*1F are “slow” caffeine metabolizers….Intake of coffee was associated with an increased risk of nonfatal MI only among individuals with slow caffeine metabolism, suggesting that caffeine plays a role in this association.

Imagine when insurance companies get their hands on this sort of information, they’ll give you your lowest risk lifestyle **dependent on your genotypic predispositions**. This sort of trait indicates the contextual response of genes and subsequent development. Genes don’t “determine” anything, they are important (or not) parameters in concert with a host of other variables.  
Here is a [popular press review](http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=4702877) of this paper.
