John Hawks on the radio

You want to know what [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) sounds like? He‚Äôll be [on *Radio Open Source* tomorrow](http://www.radioopensource.org/the-genetics-of-genealogy/) (there should be a web feed). I talked to David Miller about getting John on the show before he became famous in [Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/), so I am going to take a little credit for this. John and Spencer Wells will be ‚Äúfacing off.‚Äù John, can you ask Spencer to make his email address more accessible? I‚Äôm tired of people emailing me and asking about ways to contact him!  
**Update:** John was really amused throughout the whole show. Spencer Wells asked kind of sarcastically (?) if I was ‚ÄúRichard Dawkins.‚Äù No, I‚Äôm not, Spencer üôÇ Thanks to Chris Lydon for giving a shout out to me at the end of the show. Also, Brendan said that both John and Spencer were on the show at my suggestion, so that‚Äôs cool, I guess I‚Äôm a ‚Äúscientific activist‚Äù of sorts now?
