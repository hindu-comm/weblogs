Predicting academic achievement with cognitive ability

[Predicting academic achievement with cognitive ability](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.05.004)

> The purpose of the present study is to explain variation in academic > achievement with general cognitive ability and specific cognitive > abilities. Grade point average, Wide Range Achievement Test III > scores, and SAT scores represented academic achievement. The specific > cognitive abilities of interest were: working memory, processing > speed, and spatial ability. General cognitive ability was measured > with the Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices and the Mill Hill > Vocabulary Scales. When controlling for working memory, processing > speed, and spatial ability, in a sample of 71 young adults (29 males), > measures of general cognitive ability continued to add to the > prediction of academic achievement, but none of the specific cognitive > abilities accounted for additional variance in academic achievement > after controlling for general cognitive ability. However, processing > speed and **spatial ability continued to account for a significant amount of additional variance when predicting scores for the mathematical portion of the SAT while holding general cognitive ability constant**.
