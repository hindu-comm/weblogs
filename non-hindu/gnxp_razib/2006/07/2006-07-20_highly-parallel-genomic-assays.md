Highly parallel genomic assays

A review of [Highly parallel genomic assays](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v7/n8/execsumm/nrg1901.html)

> Recent developments in highly parallel genome-wide assays are > transforming the study of human health and disease. High-resolution > whole-genome association studies of complex diseases are finally being > undertaken after much hypothesizing about their merit for finding > disease loci. The availability of inexpensive high-density > SNP-genotyping arrays has made this feasible. Cancer biology will also > be transformed by high-resolution genomic and epigenomic analysis. In the future, most cancers might be staged by high-resolution molecular profiling rather than by gross cytological analysis. Here, we describe the key developments that enable highly parallel genomic assays.

Summary:

> - Highly parallel genomic assays have two fundamental characteristics: >   a highly parallel array-based read-out and an intrinsically >   scalable, multiplexing sample preparation. > - The power of highly parallel genomic assays is that they tend to >   follow the principle behind Mooreâ€™s law: the amount of information >   extracted from a sample increases linearly with the number of probes >   on the array, whereas the overall cost of the assay tends to >   increase at a much slower rate. > - These general concepts are being applied successfully to an >   increasing variety of assays, including gene-expression profiling, >   SNP genotyping, genomic copy-number analysis, measurement of >   allele-specific expression levels, and methylation status. > - Early genomic assays, such as gene-expression profiling, relied only >   on sequence-specific probe hybridization to confer specificity. The >   next generation of assays have made use of enzymatic discrimination >   in addition to hybridization to increase specificity and to enable >   assay designs that extract more information. > - Data quality, reproducibility and robustness of intrinsically >   parallel assays that use enzymatic discrimination have been shown to >   be high, defying the conventional wisdom that increasing sample >   complexity automatically results in lower data quality. > - The technology of highly parallel assays is enabling a revolution in >   genomics that has far-reaching implications for molecular biology >   and human health. Increasingly, ambitious projects that aim to be >   more comprehensive in their approach to genomic analysis, such as >   the International HapMap Project, the ENCODE Project, and the Cancer >   Genome Atlas, are reliant on new, highly parallel assay >   technologies. > - The orders of magnitude decrease in cost and increased speed and >   accuracy that are provided by highly parallel assays have brought us >   to the dawn of a potentially revolutionary new era of discovery in >   human genetics that will be based on comprehensive, high-resolution >   genetic mapping. > - Such studies might require about a billion or more genotypes, and >   were impractical prior to the advent of the assays that are >   described in this Review. A few years ago, the genotyping costs for >   such a study would have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars. >   Today, the costs would be a few million dollars, with far higher >   data quality and completeness, and genotyping can be carried out in >   a few weeks instead of many years. - Parallel assay systems are assisting a similar revolution in the field of DNA sequencing, and will probably enable powerful new comprehensive studies that are prohibitively costly today.
