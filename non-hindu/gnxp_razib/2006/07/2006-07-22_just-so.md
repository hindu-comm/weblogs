Just so….

Wow, [Snake-spotting may have helped us evolve-study](http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-07-20T210351Z_01_N2032_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-SCIENCE-SNAKES-DC.XML&archived=False), serious bullshit. No “study” really, just story telling. This kind of crap makes evolutionary biology look bad.

**Update:** The full paper is up in the forum as “snakes” (PDF).

**Update by Darth Quixote:** [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/snakes_isbell_2006.html), while critical, does have some nice things to say about this paper.
