ASPM and schizophrenia– nada

Regular readers know that ASPM is a microencephaly gene [under selection in humans](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/this-is-bruce-lahns-brain-on-aspm-and.php), though the particular pressure driving the selection is unknown. A group of Spanish researchers decided to test whether there is an association between variants of the gene and schizophrenia. The result: [nothing](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TC2-4JVTCG6-4&_user=10&_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2006&_rdoc=27&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d5b0b3bace449da247a239361b8815e3).

Of course, with only 233 cases and 161 controls, the actual [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power) to detect an effect was probably around zero (not that that ever stopped anyone from publishing before). There are certainly many genetic factors that play a role in the disease, so any well-designed study should be big enough to detect multiple weak effects. And the authors note this is a preliminary study; presumably there will be larger sample sizes in the future.
