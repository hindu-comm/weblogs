Liberal Duality on Lewontinism

The next time you encounter [Lewontin’s Fallacy](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001525.html) in which someone is arguing that between groups differences are not important when compared to the variation within the group, one should discern how they feel about race and gender [wage differentials](http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/econ2.pdf), for:

> It is important to recognize that **most wage inequality occurs within > and not between groups.** The unweighted average Gini coefficient > across all race, gender, and education groups was 0.256 in 1995, over > 80 percent of the total Gini. Put another way, if all groups had > identical mean wage rates (for example, black male dropouts had the > same average wages as white male college graduates) but wages differed > within groups as they do today, nearly all the inequality in wage > rates would remain.

So, when it comes to genetic variation and the implications which arise from biology, the between group differences are minimized in comparison to the in-group differences and we see a full on embrace of Lewontin’s outdated analysis, yet when the topic is a liberal touchstone, income inequality, then the small between group differences matter so much more than do the in-group differences.

Geez, can’t they simply pick a position and stick to it.
