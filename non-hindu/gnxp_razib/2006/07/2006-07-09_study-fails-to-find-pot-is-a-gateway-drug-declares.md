Study fails to find pot is a gateway drug, declares pot a gateway drug anyway

Don’t believe everything that you breathe. You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve. – Beck

Pete and friends over at DrugWarRant [hit this](http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/2006/07/05.html#a1657) [pretty](http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/2006/07/06.html#a1658) [hard](http://blogs.salon.com/0002762/2006/07/07.html#a1659). They seem a little more negative about animal research than I’d like, but give it a look.

Here are some major criticisms:

- The gateway hypothesis as presented to the public is that marijuana
  use will increase the likelihood of use and abuse of other drugs.

- The study reports the opposite of this prediction:  

  > The periodic exposure to low-dose THC during adolescence did not
  > appear to predispose animals to an increased sensitivity to initiate
  > heroin self-administration.

- If anything, THC exposure seems to have made it easier to go off of
  the stuff when they unhooked the levers from the heroin
  administration:  

  > Our experiment showed that in the absence of heroin and associated
  > cues, both THC and vehicle-pretreated rats had similar elevated
  > rates of responding on the active drug lever. Although the
  > vehicle-exposed rats showed a higher percent increase in active
  > responses than the THC rats, the behavior was not discriminative to
  > the active lever since the control rats also had a higher increase
  > in responding on the inactive lever.

- Nowhere in the study did they compare THC administration in
  adolescents versus adults, and yet the authors emphasize adolescence.
  Where on earth does this quote in the [Science
  write-up](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2006/706/1)
  come from?

I don’t have any problem believing the gateway drug idea in principle. It seems quite plausible that drugs that have similar effects (positive hedonic value) will act at the same synapses and perhaps alter the future plasticity of those synapses, but please don’t try to use this study to scare your kids. You’ll lose all your credibility in a few years when the 99% of their little pothead buddies never go near the heavy stuff. If you need a drug to keep your kids off of, try alcohol.
