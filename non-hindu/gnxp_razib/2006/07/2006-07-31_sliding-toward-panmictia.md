Sliding toward panmictia?

Not quite, but [interesting article](http://www.startribune.com/484/story/577342.html) in the Minnesota *Star Tribue*. Skip all the sentiment and hand-wringing and just jump to the statistics. Also, this is eye-opening: “By the year 2000, no large U.S. city anywhere other than on the intensely multiracial Pacific Coast had a higher share of multiracial children than Minneapolis.” Of course, the Upper Midwest and the Pacific Northwest are [whiter than average](http://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhwhite.html) regions of the country, reinforcing Steve Sailer’s point that overly large minority communities [retard assimilation](http://www.vdare.com/Sailer/la.htm).
