Sports political donations

For those of you who are, or in my case, were, into professional sports, [this site](http://www.newsmeat.com/sports_political_donations/) lists their political donations. I was surprised that Joe Theismann or Barry Switzer gave mostly Democrats. Also, the African Americans were more Democratic than I had expected (I’d assumed that their wealth would have worn away their cultural orientation in regards to politics).
