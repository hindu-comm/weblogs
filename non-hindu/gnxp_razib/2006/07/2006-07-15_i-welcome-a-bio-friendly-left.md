I welcome a bio-friendly Left!

[Strong words](http://www.counterbias.com/694.html) from a “progressive” site:

> Because it further negates their discrimination-based “biblical > worldview,” the science of human genetics – which has again suggested > homosexuality is genetic (determined before birth) and not simply “a > lifestyle choice” – is the Christian Right’s special target. Genetic > mutations and evolution are not theories. They’re facts the validity of which cannot be disputed scientifically. (Ask any bacterium or virus, or read the medical literature on pathogens evolving to become resistant to traditional drugs used against them.)

The more people appreciate human genetics, the better! It would be nice to be amongst the believers as we compare our notes on the varioum edition of [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/102-3605398-8339304).  
Though seriously, Chris’ post [Homosexuality, Essentialism, and The Ethics of Science](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/07/homosexuality_essentialism_and_1.php) reaffirms a common correlation between acceptance of the biological reality of homosexuality and toleration of the practice as a non-depravity. But, I think that of course sidesteps the real discomfort in some sectors of the Left with the “big picture” long term implications of the use of this tactical weapon in the context of the strategic war. Most people reject the [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) explicitly and reflectively, but I suspect it can not but have a powerful psychological impact “under the hood.” After all, we do live in the [Best of All Possible Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_All_Possible_Worlds)!  
But what I do I mean when I allude to tactical and strategic issues? Well, Nature’s God writes her own book without human consultation, and if we read it as a book of ethics, or a mitigation for the vices of the world, it seems clear that the flexibility necessary for a transformative program of ideological change and culture sculpting is constrained by the landscape of natural probabilities, possibilities and propensities. Even if in this particular case the book provides a seductive argument which wins the battle for this day, it is a capricious tool as likely to explode in one’s face as cut through enemy lines. Remember, the full title of Darwin’s masterpiece is *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*.  
Beware, for your tool comes not to bring peace, but to bring a sword of purifying selection. Nature looks favorably upon only a subset of the sample space of all possible Creation….
