Reaching out & being human

Paul [comments on blogging, politics and science](https://theforcethat.blogspot.com/2006/07/blogging-and-country-divided.html) in response to my [interview](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2006/06/29/genetics-interview-5-razib-of-gene-expression/) at [Genetics & Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2006/06/29/genetics-interview-5-razib-of-gene-expression/). Some of what Paul says mirrors [Chris of Mixing Memory’s](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/06/why_blog_about_science.php) sentiments in relation to reaching out and engaging in dialogue with those who differ from you.  
There is a big topic, and I’m not going to weigh in deeply at this point, but, I will say that there is a balance between accepting differences and dismissing the absurd. Where people draw the line differs. Myself, Creationism is absurd. So is someone who questions the selectionist narrative of [adult lactase persistence](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/before-dawn-slammed-in-nature.php). There are matters of *fact* and matters of *norms*. I tend to have liberal attitudes toward difference in the second category, but am far sharper toward (or likely to speak in an “ex cathedra” voice) in the case of the former.  
I suppose you could sum up my attitude by saying that life is short, facts are sacred and politics is sport for wimpy people.
