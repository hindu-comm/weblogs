Fisher, Wright and evolution of dominance

[Robert Skipper](http://drrob.typepad.com/hpb_etc/2006/07/whatever_happen.html) has an [enormous post](http://drrob.typepad.com/hpb_etc/2006/07/whatever_happen.html) on R.A. Fisher & Sewall Wright’s theories of dominance. I think Wright was more in the right on this issue, remember, it is easier to break (lose function) than make (gain function).
