Gould's citation record

A comment that crossed my screen via that series of tubes:

> There is a perception, alluded to in the discussion above, that while > Gould was a remarkably adept and influential writer of popular > science, his work as a scientist per se was less notable and much less > influential/respected. This is not a view universally held, as a > historian of science his contributions are widely described as being > outstanding, and he is said to have been very well respected in his > own field of paleao biology. However I have tried to establish how > influential his science was by establishing how often his scientific > papers (not his popular works) have been cited in the scientific > literature, through the ISI databases. For comparison, Richard > Dawkins’ most highly cited scientific paper has 100 citations, Ernst > Mayr’s has 173, CG Williams’ has 253 and D Tutyama’s has 394. Gould’s > most highly cited paper (in Proc R Soc 1979) has 1,613 citations, and > the next eight have 863, 609, 291, 169, 138, 121, 121, and 109 > citations – the last of these published in 1974 is on antler size. I do not think that any claim that Gould was not highly influential as a scientist is objectively sustainable. His citation record is exceptional by any standards.

Informative and thoughtful comments welcome.
