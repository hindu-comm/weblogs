In my country, we have problem

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: most people are effing idiots. One thing keeping policies like these from actually being implemented now is the bizarre quasi-religious reverence for the Constitution present in our country. In [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1978) [places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_France), the proper reaction to “that’s not constitutional” is “well, then it’s about time to change the constitution”. Somehow, luckily, the elite in America has convinced the masses that our Founding Fathers were infalliable, God-like uber-democrats. It’s enought to prevent shit like this (a crescent-shaped tattooo? C’mon now.), though it’s worth noting that, even with these guidelines, people have been able to justify a lot of obviously unconstitutional insanity (see internment, Japanese). But without Constitution-worship, would America be an even more populist (I obviously consider this word a pejorative) country than it is now? Absolutely.
