Convergent evolution in skin color – part n

[Genetic Evidence for the Convergent Evolution of Light Skin in Europeans and East Asians](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/msl203v1):

> …these results point to the importance of several genes in shaping the > pigmentation phenotype and a complex evolutionary history involving > strong selection. Polymorphisms in two genes, *ASIP* and *OCA2*, may > play a shared role in shaping light and dark pigmentation across the > globe while *SLC24A5*, *MATP*, and *TYR* have a predominant role in the evolution of light skin in Europeans but not in East Asians. These findings support a case for the recent convergent evolution of a lighter pigmentation phenotype in Europeans and East Asians.

**Related:** A post on [SLC24A5](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/race-is-skin-deep.php) and one on OCA2. Earlier [commentary](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/08/beyond-mc1r.php) on the lead author’s work (a [correction](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/correction-on-mc1r.php) from her). Convergent evolution on skin color.  
Skin color is a very salient trait, we notice it pretty easily. So I believe it is a very good thing in terms of public understanding of the postgenomic era that this character is now being elucidated on a fine grained scale. Within 5-10 years I predict this will be a rather uninteresting trait because we’ll have a good grip on 95% of the variation between and within populations.

**Addendum:** After I initially drafted this post I found [this paper](http://www.springerlink.com/content/l54415w664352447/?p=5ef30b9bae704437b4b5575768efb102&pi=1) which isolates the *DCT* locus as implicated in light skin in East Asias, but not Europeans. The science here is pretty fast, loci build up as I write!
