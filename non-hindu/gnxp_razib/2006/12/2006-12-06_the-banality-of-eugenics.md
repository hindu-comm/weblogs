The banality of eugenics

Armand Leroi has a new [review article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=17139290&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum) out which argues that neo-eugenics is here. I comment on it over at [my other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/12/eugenics_again.php) (you can download Armand’s essay at a link provided over at the other entry, I’d provide the link here but PDFs are kind of big so I might as well make you work for the bandwidth hit).
