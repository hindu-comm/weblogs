Malcolm Gladwell gets a course in statistics

There’s been a somewhat ill-tempered back-and-forth between [Steve Sailer](http://isteve.com/) and [Malcolm Gladwell](http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/) on the subject of race and racism in the last few days (you can start in the middle with [this post](http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2006/12/the_lunatic_fri.html) and move forwards and backwards from there to get the whole story). The crux of the debate is this story:

> In Blink, I tell the story of a study done by the law professor Ian > Ayres. Ayres put togother of group of young men and women–half white > and half black–and sent them to 242 car dealerships all around > Chicago. All were attractive, well dressed, and well-educated. All had > the same cover story: that they were professionals from a wealthy part > of Chicago. All pointed to the lowest-priced car on the floor and > said–“I’m interested in buying this car.” Ayres’s question was–all > other things being equal, how does skin color and gender affect the > initial price quoted by a car salesman? His results: white men, on average, got quoted a price \$725 above invoice, white women got quoted a price \$935 above invoice, black women \$1195 above invoice, and black men \$1687 above invoice.

Is this discrimination (in the pejorative sense of the word) or is this price discrimination (a morally neutral action: charging each group what it’s willing to pay)? Gladwell claims the former, Sailer the latter. The debate is at the links above, so go read it yourself. What I want to focus on is this comment from Gladwell:

> Let’s go back to the study. The male and female, black and white > testers who Ayres sent out to car dealerships all gave the salesmen > the same set of facts. They were all roughly the same age (late > twenties). They all drove the same kind of car into the lot. They all > dressed neatly and conservatively. They identified themselves as > college-educated professionals (sample job: systems analyst at a > bank). And they said they lived in the upper-income Chicago > neighborhood of Streeterville. The car salesman, then, has several > pieces of data from which to create his stereotype. **He has the > gender, race, age, occupation, educational level, and class (or at least a class proxy) of his potential customer. And what did he do? With the black men, he zeroed in on age and race, and ignored everything else**.  
> …  
> Why \[are the car dealers\] so intent on zeroing in on what is only > one of many available and relevant facts about the customer? The short answer to that question, I think, is that **this is what racial prejudice is: it is the irrational elevation of race-based considerations over other, equally or more relevant factors**.

It should be obvious that the imputation of racial prejudice here is absolutely absurd (as was immediately pointed out in the comments). Here’s why:

Let’s take a look at all the factors Gladwell claims are available for the car salesman to consider: gender, race, age, occupation, educational level, and class. Now let’s consider the sample he has to work with (limiting ourselves to black males, as Gladwell does: “with the black men…”). Sex: all male. Age: all late 20s. Occupation: all professionals. Educational level: all college educated. Class: all well dressed and wealthy.

In fact, the *only* factor that varies in this analysis is race (where he gets the thing about age, I’m not sure). This isn’t an accident; the study was explicitly designed that way. So is it *at all* surprising that race is the only factor that influences anything? Of course not! In fact, when you include women in the analysis, you find that gender plays a role as well (and you see a possibly interesting differential role of gender in the two races). **If other variables were included in the sample, they too would likely have been found to play a role in dealer pricing. But they were held constant\*. That’s why they call it a *variable*, my friend–it has to *vary***.

\*It occurrs to me that I worded this very poorly originally, though I suppose everyone rearranged the sentence for me unconsciously.
