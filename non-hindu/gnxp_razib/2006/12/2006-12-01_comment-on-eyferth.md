Comment on Eyferth

[Ron Bailey covered the Flynn-Murray debate at Reason.](http://www.reason.com/news/show/116991.html) [An insightful comment](http://www.reason.com/blog/show/116992.html#604705) was left on the Reason blog:

Flynn seems to have reached the same underlying conclusion: “smart enough to get into the military, dumb enough to have an unwanted child”. But he applied this reasoning only to the Black GIs. I see no reason that if true it wouldn’t apply to both groups.
