Brownology

[Low Levels of Genetic Divergence across Geographically and Linguistically Diverse Populations from India](http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0020215):

> The authors performed an extensive investigation of Indian genetic > diversity and population relationships, sampling 15 groups of > India-born immigrants to the United States and genotyping each > individual at 1,200 genetic markers genome-wide. Populations from > India, and groups from South Asia more generally, form a genetic > cluster, so that individuals placed within this cluster are more > genetically similar to each other than to individuals outside the > cluster. However, the amount of genetic differentiation among Indian > populations is relatively small. The authors conclude that genetic > variation in India is distinctive with respect to the rest of the > world, but that the level of genetic divergence is smaller in Indians > than might be expected for such a geographically and linguistically > diverse group.
