IQ vs. hotness

Here is my general model. Ignore the magnitude of the slope, I suspect the covariance between IQ & hotitude is rather modest indeed. Nevertheless, the graph illustrates my general model, a linear increase between 85 and 115, about 75% of the population. Then, a slight linear decrease up the IQ ladder (though beyond 140 you donâ€™t have too many people). Finally, below 85, and definitely below 75, a much sharper drop in attractiveness, and increase in phenotypic variance due to macroscale developmental instability.
