The Muslim Middle East

[Juan Cole](http://www.juancole.com/) has a Ph.D., while I have overdue library book fines (never over \$10 at one time though!). He has a [map](http://www.juancole.com/graphics/middle_east4.jpg), and so do I. Look below the fold (some explanations as well).

What do the labels mean? Here are some rough, **rough**, generalizations. Muslim readers are encouraged to offer their opinion so long as they don’t call *takfir*.  
Sunni – catchall for groups within the Muslim mainstream who aren’t Shia and adhere to four primary schools of *shariat* (Islamic Law)  
Salafi – originally Sunni reformists who attempted to go back to first principles. Some were originally quite modernist, but mostly they are now associated with violent nuts (al Qaeda) or repressive nuts (Saudi Arabia).  
Shia – catchall for groups who place an emphasis on the lineage of Ali and the anti-Sunni party. Pretty wide though in its range. A lot of ‘heretical’ systems of belief (e.g., [Mutazili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutazili)) are preserved in small Shia groups as alternative traditions  
Ibadi – random non-Sunni and non-Shia group that managed to survive in Oman. Originally associated with nuttery (Khajirites) as they considered the Shia party too soft on the Sunni compromises with something called reality, but now pretty mellow (the Sultan of Oman allowed a Hindu temple to open)  
Alevi – persecuted by the Ottomans, probably somewhat Shia, but crypto so long that it is kind of confused. As many as 20% of Turks might be Alevi, but who knows, they lie all the time  
Alawites – like the Alevi. Given official Muslim status within the past few decades, but murky past and crypto tendencies in their religion. Today they are Shia of the Twelver sect, but this is more politics than reality (Syria and Iran are allies, and Syria has backed Twelver Shia groups in Lebanon)  
Twelver Shia – the vast majority of the Shia in the world, focused on Iran, but scattered through the Persian Gulf, Pakistan and Lebanon  
Zaydi Shia – common in Yemen. A lot like Sunni. They pray in the same mosques in Yemen  
The map is rough and doesn’t show frequencies. For example, Pakistan is about 20% Shia. Lebanon 30-40%. Saudi Arabia 10%, but almost all the eastern coast. There are local patterns.
