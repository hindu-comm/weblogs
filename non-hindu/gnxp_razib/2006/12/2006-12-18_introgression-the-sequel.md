Introgression, the sequel

About a month ago I posted quite a bit about Neandertal introgression into modern humans. That is, the uptake of Neandertal alleles are a few specific adaptively salient loci even while ancestry remains predominantly African. Now John Hawks and Gregory Cochran have a new paper out, [Dynamics of Adaptive Introgression from Archaic to Modern Humans](http://www.paleoanthro.org/journal/content/PA20060101.pdf), which synthesizes the first of the new results. The paper is open access, but I’ll throw out the money shot:

> We suggest that adaptive introgression of alleles from archaic humans > may be one of the central mechanisms leading to the “human > revolution.” The behavioral characteristics  
> of modern humans, including the employment of symbolic culture and > sophisticated technologies, followed the attainment of modern human > anatomical features by a considerable delay (Klein and Edgar 2002). > The notion that a single small population of incipient modern humans > had the perfect genetic combination for ultimate success seems quite > improbable. Instead, the long coevolution of modern anatomy and > behavior in contact with archaic humans, even as those archaic > populations appeared to diminish, provided a rich source of > adaptations for the expanding modern population. **With current > genomic techniques, we are beginning to find these archaic genes. We > expect that they will prove central to the story of modern human > origins.**

What Hawks and Cochran propose is that **introgression of adaptive alleles into the Out-of-Africa substratum is the key to humanity as we understand it**.
