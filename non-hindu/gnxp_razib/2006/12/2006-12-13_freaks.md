Freaks!

This is almost an X-Men worthy mutant: [the inability to feel pain](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7121/abs/nature05413.html). The researchers in this paper found three inbred families in Pakistan with the trait. The description is fascinating:

> The index case for the present study was a ten-year-old child, well > known to the medical service after regularly performing ‘street > theatre’. He placed knives through his arms and walked on burning > coals, but experienced no pain. He died before being seen on his > fourteenth birthday, after jumping off a house roof. Subsequently, we > studied three further consanguineous families in which there were > individuals with similar histories of a lack of pain appreciation, > each originating from northern Pakistan and part of the Qureshi > birdari/clan. All six affected individuals had never felt any pain, at > any time, in any part of their body. Even as babies they had shown no > evidence of pain appreciation. None knew what pain felt like, although > the older individuals realized what actions should elicit pain > (including acting as if in pain after football tackles). All had > injuries to their lips (some requiring later plastic surgery) and/or > tongue (with loss of the distal third in two cases), caused by biting > themselves in the first 4 yr of life. All had frequent bruises and > cuts, and most had suffered fractures or osteomyelitis, which were > only diagnosed in retrospect because of painless limping or lack of > use of a limb. The children were considered of normal intelligence by > their parents and teachers, and by the caring physicians. One author > saw and reviewed all six affected individuals and their families.

They then mapped the trait to mutations in SCN9A, a component of an ion channel expressed in pain-sensing neurons. Not only is this study really cool, but it could possibly lead to new painkillers or methods in anesthesia. Hooray for inbreeding!

ADDENDUM: Nick Wade has an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/science/13cnd-pain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) on the study.
