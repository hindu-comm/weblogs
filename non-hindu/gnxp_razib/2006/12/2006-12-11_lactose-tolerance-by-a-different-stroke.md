Lactose tolerance by a different stroke

[Convergent adaptation of human lactase persistence in Africa and Europe](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng1946.html):

> A SNP in the gene encoding lactase (LCT) (C/T-13910) is associated > with the ability to digest milk as adults (lactase persistence) in > Europeans, but the genetic basis of lactase persistence in Africans > was previously unknown. We conducted a genotype-phenotype association > study in 470 Tanzanians, Kenyans and Sudanese and identified three > SNPs (G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907) that are associated with > lactase persistence and that have derived alleles that significantly enhance transcription from the LCT promoter in vitro. These SNPs originated on different haplotype backgrounds from the European C/T-13910 SNP and from each other.
