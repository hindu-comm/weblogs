Tools for a better genomics

Nature Biotechnology has a primer entitled “[What is a support vector machine?](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v24/n12/abs/nbt1206-1565.html)” (quick answer: a statistical method for classifying things) for those into that sort of thing. It’s a very readable, non-mathematical introduction to the topic. Genomicists are generating more data than has even been seen before in biology, the capability to analyze it is going to advance in leaps and bounds in the coming years.
