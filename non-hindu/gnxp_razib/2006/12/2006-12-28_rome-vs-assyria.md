Rome vs. Assyria

[SharpBlue](http://www.theculture.org/rich/sharpblue/archives/000173.html) on [Rome vs. Assyria](http://www.theculture.org/rich/sharpblue/archives/000173.html). Interesting fact, the last great Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal, could read and write (remember, this is before widespread use of phonetic script, so this was no mean feat). Thanks to Ashurbanipalâ€™s library much of the corpus of Sumerian and Akkadian literature came down to us.
