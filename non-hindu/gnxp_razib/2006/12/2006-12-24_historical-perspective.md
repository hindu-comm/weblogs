Historical perspective

I’m reading [The Fall of the Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0195159543/ref=s9_asin_title/104-6727250-3005519) by Peter Heather. Most people know I’m a classical history buff (e.g., I’ve read a fair number of the late [Michael Grant’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Grant_%28author%29) works). Now, one thing that always strikes is this: **2,000 years ago a political organization existed which stretched from *Scotland* to *Iraq*, from *Hungary* to *Morocco***. How wild is that?
