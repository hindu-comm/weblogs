In answer to my critics

There were some rather irritable responses to my new [Sunni vs. Shia](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/sunni-vs-shia-let-me-school-you.php) post. I deleted the more childish ones (‘just cuz you act smart doesn’t mean you are!’). Jaime Klein’s [comment](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/116578622934431186?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/sunni-vs-shia-let-me-school-you.php#1319778) was funny, but bbartlog’s response was [even more humorous](http://www.haloscan.com/comments//116578622934431186?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/sunni-vs-shia-let-me-school-you.php#1319822). I am not going to say much more on this topic than this: Chris Rock used to explain why his female friends were all good looking, “Cuz you never know….”
