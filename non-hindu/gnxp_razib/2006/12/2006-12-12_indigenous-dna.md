Indigenous DNA

[The Genographic Project](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2005/08/17/the-genographic-project/) is [elicting a new round](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/us/10dna.html?hp&ex=1165726800&en=89811195149ec049&ei=5094&partner=homepage) of objections from indigenous community leaders. [Genetics and Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2005/08/17/the-genographic-project/) has a good [post up highlighting the issues](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2005/08/17/the-genographic-project/). Two prelim points:

1.  I am skeptical of the science that is going to come out of this. I
    believe that the “hot stuff” is going to be studying selection in
    the human genome, not trying to reconstruct phylogenies 2.  I also accept that “science” has been the tool of injustice and even
    barbarity against indigenous peoples 3.  I say “community leaders” because “indigenous peoples” aren’t a
    monolith. Just as George W. Bush doesn’t represent all Americans, so
    community leaders don’t represent the whole community

Now, look at this quote:

> …**Geographic origin stories told by DNA can clash with long-held beliefs, threatening a world view some indigenous leaders see as vital to preserving their culture**.  
> They argue that genetic ancestry information could also jeopardize land rights and other benefits that are based on the notion that their people have lived in a place since the beginning of time.

First, does this sound familiar? Science clashing with long-head beliefs? Second, why the hell are land rights and benefits contingent upon mythologies which can be empirically debunked?
