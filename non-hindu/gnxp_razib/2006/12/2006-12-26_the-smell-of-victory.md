The smell of victory

Humans can track smells, and the ability to do so is greatly aided by practice (and the use of both nostrils). [Very cool](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n1/abs/nn1819.html):

> Whether mammalian scent-tracking is aided by inter-nostril comparisons > is unknown. We assessed this in humans and found that (i) humans can > scent-track, (ii) they improve with practice, (iii) the human nostrils > sample spatially distinct regions separated by approx3.5 cm and, > critically, (iv) scent-tracking is aided by inter-nostril comparisons. > These findings reveal fundamental mechanisms of scent-tracking and > suggest that the poor reputation of human olfaction may reflect, in > part, behavioral demands rather than ultimate abilities.
