Come out and smell a couple of cigarettes

Association between genes on chromosome 11 and nicotine addiction. [Abstract](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/24/3498):

> Nicotine dependence (ND) is a moderately heritable trait. We > ascertained a set of 1615 subjects in 632 families \[319 > African-American (AA) and 313 European-American (EA)\] based on > affected sibling pairs with cocaine or opioid dependence. Subjects > were interviewed with the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug > Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA)…There was relatively weak evidence > for association of the flanking DRD2 and NCAM1 markers to ND, but very > strong evidence of association of multiple SNPs at TTC12 and ANKK1 in > both populations (minimal P=0.0007 in AAs and minimal P=0.00009 in > EAs), and in the pooled sample, as well as strong evidence for highly > significant association of a single haplotype spanning TTC12 and ANKK1 > to ND in the pooled sample (P=0.0000001). We conclude that a risk > locus for ND, important both in AAs and EAs, maps to a region that > spans TTC12 and ANKK1. Functional studies of these loci are warranted. These results provide additional information useful in evaluating the many earlier discrepant findings regarding association of DRD2 with substance dependence.
