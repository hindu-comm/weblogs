Evangelical Atheists and the Sciences of Religion

I spent some time with the [Edge Reality Club](http://www.edge.org/discourse/bb.html) today. I hadn’t had time to read it yet. It is no surprise to me that [Scott Atran](http://www.edge.org/discourse/bb.html#atran2) is closest to me ideology and analysis. I liked his book far better than any of Harris’, Dawkins’, and Dennett’s books I’ve read.  
The topic of the discussion was Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival.

The other participants accused Atran of ignoring the fact that religions, and in particular, Islam, actively encourage destructive behavior like suicide bombing, apostate killing, pograms, etc. I dont think he ignores that at all. But he says instead, what can we do with what we know? Im so grateful to find someone who thinks about this the way I do. This is exactly what I mean, when I talk about leveraging Islam to stop the slaughter and help instantiate democracy in Iraq.  
Atran on evangelical atheism:

> At the conference, Harris and partners ignored the increasingly rich > body of scientific research on religion. They ignored the vast body of > empirical data and analysis of terrorism â€” a phenomenon they > presented as a natural outgrowth of religion. The avowedly certain but > uncritical arguments they made about the moral power of science and > the moral bankruptcy of religion involved no science at all. Some good > scientists stepped out of their field of expertise, leaving science behind for the unreflective sort of faith-based thinking they railed against. Sadly, in this regard, even good scientists join other people in unreason. >
> Harris despairs that my approach to dogmatism is to throw up my hands > and “make declarations about â€˜the basic irrationality of human life > and society’.” No, I argue that one way to deal with this important > problem is to use science and rational processes to study irrational > ones and then to leverage that scientific knowledge in ways that can > affect public policy, although this second step may have to be more > art than science. Harris suggests that if, indeed, irrationality is > some vestige of our evolutionary legacy, then we should still be able > to master it and perhaps eventually eliminate it from society through reason and vigilance as we are increasingly able to do with rape. I think a better, deeper, more pervasive analogy would be sex: repress it one way and it will pop out other ways.  
> My critique of Harris and company was that: >
> \(1\) An increasing body of scientific research on religion suggests > that, contrary to Harris’s personal and scientifically uninformed > intuitions about what religion consists of, the apparent invalidity of religious thought is insensitive to the kind of simple-minded disconfirmation through demonstrations of incoherence that Harris and others propose. >
> \(2\) No data by Harris or others was offered to suggest that the > naturalistic worldview they mean to replace religion with would be, or could be, successful; or that such a worldview would generate more happiness, compassion or peace (which most us at the conference hope for). >
> \(3\) Evidence supporting empirical claims about negative behavior > caused by religious beliefs in general, or Islam in particular, was > based on a decidedly selective sample or idiosyncratic interpretation (e.g., Harris tells us that he has read the Qur’an and on his reading, which he may share with some minority of Muslims, the Qur’an literally prescribes, or at least sanctions, suicide terrorism). >
> \(4\) Experiments on “sacred values” (which Harris refers to in his > reply but misunderstands, and which were presented in more rigorous > form before the American Association for the Advancement of Science > and the National Security Council at the White House) suggest that > arguments by Harris and others about how to best lessen the noxious effects of dogmatism are liable to do more harm than good for his own cause (which is also my own cause and that of most others at the conference). >

Some scientists have some good and helpful insights into human beings’ existential problems some of the time, but some good scientists have done more to harm others than most people are remotely capable of.

Scott and I are in complete agreement–sho, supernatural and religious beliefs cause dreadful problems. BUT it is biologically, culturally, and psychologically impossible to destroy religion.  
What to do? Since we cannot eradicate religion, let’s leverage it instead, for benevolent goals.

Here I quote Atran’s section on sacred values, and how those values can leverage arbitration and conflict resolution in the face of anti-rational behavior. The classic example of anti-rational behavior is the Palestine/Israel conflict.

In neither the settler nor the refugee studies did participants responding to the “tragic” deals regard these deals as more materially likely or implementable than participants evaluating taboo or taboo+ deals. >

Further studies with 750 Hamas members and non Hamas controls this past June, show similar results, as do on-going pilot studies among Christian fundamentalists who consider abortion and gay marriage to violate sacred values. >

My aim is quite the opposite: to politically engage those deepest held religious beliefs that are matters of life and death for peoples and nations.

This is what I mean when I talk about using the science of religion to solve resistant geo-political conflicts. Like Palestine. Like Iraq. If we understand the mechanism, can’t we exploit it?

note: The “sciences of religion” is a tribute to one of my favorite books of Islamic theo-philosophy, the incomparable al-Ghazali’s The Resusitator of the Sciences of Religion.
