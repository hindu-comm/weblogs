Jaakkeli says….

From the mouth of Finns….

> It seems like the high American total fertility rate is purely a > result of a) recent immigration of high-fertility groups and older > presence of minorities with higher birth rates and b) an artifact how > the total fertility rate responds to the different age patterns in > fertility, not a difference in eventual child number. White Americans > have simply average European fertility. Those who believe otherwise > invariably turn out to have just swallowed a silly self-congratulatory/doomsday myth (pick one depending on whether you’re an Europe-hating American or an America-hating European) without doing any fact-checking. >
> To eliminate total fertility rate illusions, it’s easy to just look at > completed fertility rates. This gives old data, but it should be > recent enough to test ideas about secularity and birth rate. For women born in 1960 (in baby-making age mainly during the 1980s and the 1990s, we should see secularisation differences here) the top 10 of OECD baby makers are, with babies per woman… >

Or something equally dumb.
