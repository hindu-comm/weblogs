Red wine; maybe not resveratrol

For those of you faithfully taking your resveratrol supplements, may I suggest a little procyanidin addition to your regimen? Heard about it on the Nature Podcast.

> Regular, moderate consumption of red wine is linked to a reduced risk > of coronary heart disease and to lower overall mortality, but the > relative contribution of wine’s alcohol and polyphenol components to > these effects is unclear. Here we identify procyanidins as the > principal vasoactive polyphenols in red wine and show that they are > present at higher concentrations in wines from areas of southwestern > France and Sardinia, where traditional production methods ensure that these compounds are efficiently extracted during vinification. These regions also happen to be associated with increased longevity in the population.
