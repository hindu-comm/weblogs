I'm brown dammit!

I was in a public place the other day and some small Arab-looking guy was talking really loudly in what sounded like Arabic on the phone. I was reading a book and eventually the guy was like, “Hey, do you speak Arabic?” I was like, “No.” And he replied, “Do you speak Mexican?” And I replied, “Uh, no.” So he goes on, “Where you from?” I reply, “My family is from Bangladesh.” His response? “Is that India?” I say, “Kind of.” “I was born in India. Abu Sabbas. You know Abu Sabbas?” I replied, “No.” He continued, “It’s north of Napali. You know Napali?” I didn’t, but I smiled and nodded. “My father was working in India. I’m from Israel.” Finally he left me alone.
