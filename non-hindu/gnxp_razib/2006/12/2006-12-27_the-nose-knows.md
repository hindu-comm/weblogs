The nose knows

The paper on the ability of humans to [track smells](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/12/smell-of-victory.php) contained a couple interesting references on the human specific loss of some olfactory genes (see an old post [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/000783.html) for an interesting correlation between the loss of these genes and the rise of color vision). Apparently, some genes have both functional and non-functional versions that still [segregate within the population](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v34/n2/abs/ng1160.html). So do different populations have receptors for different scents?

The last link is to a paper that typed 51 olfactory receptor genes in 189 people. It’s a little unclear where these 189 people come from (though they do refer to African-Americans, so it’s apparently a sample of Americans); it would be interesting to type them in a large number of populations (the human diversity panel, perhaps?) and give that hypothesis a whirl.

However, see [this paper](http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020146) for an argument that humans actually have a pretty good sense of smell, and some possible explanations for why the loss of olfactory receptors doesn’t mean the loss of the sense:

> \[M\]uch of the olfactory system can be removed with no effect on > smell perception. The olfactory receptor genes map topographically > onto the first relay station, a sheet of modules called glomeruli in > the olfactory bulb. Up to 80% of the glomerular layer in the rat can > be removed without significant effect on olfactory detection and > discrimination. If the remaining 20% of the glomeruli-and the > olfactory receptor genes they represent-can subserve the functions of > 1,100 genes, **it implies that 350 genes in the human are more than > enough to smell as well as a mouse**.
