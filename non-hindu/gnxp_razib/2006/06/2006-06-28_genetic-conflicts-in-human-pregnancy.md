Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy

In the long winded post below I referred to genetic conflicts in pregnancy. If you are curious about this, I highly recommend [Mother Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345408934/geneexpressio-20/102-3605398-8339304) by Sarah Hrdy. Though the topic is placed in the context of female evolution (of our species) in general, it gets a thorough treatment. If you are interested in the technical literature, I recommend this review, [Genetic Conflicts in Pregnancy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=8115596&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum) by David Haig. Since it is a *review*, it is less analytical and formal than much of Haig’s work, so it reads easily. You can get the [pdf](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/haig/pdfs/genetic%20conflicts%20in%20human%20pregnancy.pdf) on Haig’s website.
