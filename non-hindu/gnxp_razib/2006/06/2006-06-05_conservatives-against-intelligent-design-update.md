Conservatives against Intelligent Design – update

[Brown gaucho](http://www.indiancowboy.net/blog/) has set up a [website](http://www.caidweb.org/blog/), [Conservatives Against Intelligent Design](http://www.caidweb.org/blog/). He [elaborates](http://www.caidweb.org/blog/?p=10) on a few points in one of his introductory posts. So far [nearly 200 people have signed](http://www.petitionthem.com/default.asp?sect=detail&pet=2780) the mission statement, with some known figures such as [John Derbyshire](http://olimu.com/), [Derek Lowe](http://www.corante.com/pipeline/) and [Pejman Yousefzadeh](http://www.chequer-board.net). It would be nice to have others who have spoken against Intelligent Design on the Right on board. I’m thinking of people like [Stephen Bainbridge](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/), if anyone knows him, send him an email!
