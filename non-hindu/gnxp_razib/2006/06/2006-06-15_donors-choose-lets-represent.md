Donors Choose – let’s represent!

*Time to represent…no point pulling one’s hair about the ignorance of the anti-evolutionist unwashed unless one is willing to do something about the problem, right?*  
**Small update:** Props to those of you who have given so far! Small \$\$\$ can go a long way. In any case, just so you know, everyone should feel free to give **directly** to whichever project they want to give to. If you **do** give to this weblog’s Donor account, know that I’ll probably throw most of the cash first to the genetics & evolution related stuff.  
\[end update\]  
Those of us who blog here at ScienceBlogs think science is cool, important, and worth understanding. If you’re reading the blogs here, chances are you feel the same way.  
A lot of us fell in love with science because of early experiences in school — teachers who made science intriguing, exciting, maybe a little bit dangerous. But tightening budgets are making it harder and harder for public school teachers to provide the books, equipment, and field trips to make science come alive for kids.  
DonorsChoose.org gives us a way to help teachers get the job done. A bunch of us at [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/) have set up Bloggers Challenges which will let us (and that includes you) contribute to worthy school projects in need of financial assistance. We’ll be able to track our progress right on the DonorsChoose site. And — because we like a little friendly competition — we’ll be updating you periodically as to which blogger’s readers are getting his or her challenge closest to its goal.  
You don’t need to give a barrel of money to help the kids — as little as \$10 can help. You’re joining forces with a bunch of other people, and all together, your small contributions can make a big difference.

**How It Works**  
Follow the links above to the DonorsChoose website.  
Pick a project from the slate the blogger has selected (or more than one).  
Donate.  
(If you’re the loyal reader of multiple participating blogs and you don’t want to play favorites, you can donate to multiple challenges!)  
When Donors Choose sends you a confirmation email, forward it to: [\[emailprotected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2556470b414a4b4a5756464d4a4a56400b474a4b444b5f44654248444c490b464a48) This is your contest entry.  
Sit back and watch the little donation thermometers inch towards 100 percent. Once the Challenge ends, we’ll select winners at random.  
**Contest you say? What’s that about?**  
Just in case you’re on the fence about helping the kids, we thought we’d provide some incentives to randomly drawn donors. They are:
