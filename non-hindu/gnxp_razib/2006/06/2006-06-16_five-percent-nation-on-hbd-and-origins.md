Five Percent Nation on HBD and Origins

I recently came across an article about the 5% Nation and its place in the rap world and thought some of you might be interested in seeing what beliefs some of the core of the original NY hip-hop scene (Busta Rhymes, Wu Tang Clan, Nas, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane) are espousing. I was really unaware of the origin and specifics of this particular sect. [Read the article](http://comp.uark.edu/%7Etsweden/5per.html). Some choice quotes below the fold.

> Seven is the number of perfection. It stands for the seventh letter of > the alphabet, G, and for God. (Five Percenters originated the homeboy > expression, “‘sup \[what’s up\], G?”; originally “G” stood for God, > not gangsta.) According to Jah-Z-Allah, keeper of the 5% website, “The > God sees in cycles of 7 colors of the rainbow and hears in 7 cycles of > notes on the musical scale.”17 According to Farad’s lessons, the > Original (Black) Man has 7 1/2 ounces of brain, the (white) devil, > only 6 ounces (Farad, Lost Found Muslim Lesson No. 2).

> The 85% are those without the knowledge, the mentally blind, deaf and > dumb who are bent on self-destruction. The 10% are the bloodsuckers of > the poor, those who have knowledge and power but who use it to mystify > and abuse the 85%. The 10% include the “grafted” white devil (created, > according to Farad’s teaching, by the evil scientist Yacub > approximately 6000 years ago) as well as the orthodox Muslims and > Christian preachers who preach that god is a “spook” or a “mystery > god.” >
> To hear my people been lost for over 400 years  
> And they tried this mystery God  
> And all they got was hard times >
> –Brand Nubian, “Ain’t No Mystery” (In God We Trust) >
> The 5% are the poor righteous teachers who preach the divinity of > (black) man, the god who is “manifest” (not a spook, not a mystery > god) and who will save the 85% from destruction.

I realize you could fill the entire internet with the bizarre beliefs of this or that religious sect, but I thought this one was particularly interesting given the potential impact of these artists on pop culture and because I generally enjoy the work of a lot of these folks. I wonder though how much other fans actually take to heart?
