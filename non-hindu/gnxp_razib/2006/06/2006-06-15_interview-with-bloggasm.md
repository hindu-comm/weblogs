Interview with Bloggasm

Simon of [Bloggasm](http://bloggasm.com/) asked me 5 questions, and [I responded](http://bloggasm.com/interview-with-gene-expression). Now, I will admit that I found being “interviewed” to offer my “opinion” kind of hilarious (another interview with me should pop up on the web at the end of this month, “watch this space,” or, better yet, [read another genetics blog](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/) regularly). As a blogger basically I am offering a never-ending stream of opinion, so it seems like going to the ice-cream parlor when you’ve got two fridges of Costco creams sitting at home. But hey, food is more than about ingestion, and interaction with other human beings means kicking back control to others sometimes and letting them dictate the flow.
