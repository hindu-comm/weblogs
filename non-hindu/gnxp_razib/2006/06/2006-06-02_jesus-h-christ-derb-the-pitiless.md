Jesus H. Christ, Derb the pitiless

It is no secret that [John Derbyshire](http://olimu.com/) is a friend of mine. I am sure most *SB* readers would find such a connection abhorrent, nevertheless, any man who picks up Mark Ridleyâ€™s [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199267944/geneexpressio-20/) at my recommendation is a friend ðŸ™‚ The goddess of evolution should not just be admired and given due respect, one should strive to *understand* her. In any case, it is easy to stand by Darwinâ€™s legacy amongst fellow travellers, but over the past year Derb has been defending the scientific consensus over at *NRO* in the face of a wall of reader hostility and relative neutrality from his colleagues.

  
With this, I point you to [A Frigid and Pitiless Dogma](http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=3190&sec_id=3190), Derbâ€™s review of Ramesh Ponnuruâ€™s [Party of Death](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596980044/geneexpressio-20/002-6235532-7197621). Here is a sampler:

> The philosophical passages strictly follow the Golden Rule of > religious apologetics, which is: The conclusion is known in advance, > and the task of the intellectual is to erect supporting arguments. It > would be an astounding thing, just from a statistical point of view, > if, after conducting a rigorous open-ended inquiry from philosophical > first principles, our author came to conclusions precisely congruent > with the dogmas of the church in which he himself is a communicant. > Yet that is the case, very nearly, with Party of Death. Remarkable! > What if, after all that intellectual work, all that propositional > algebra, all those elegant syllogisms, the author had come to the conclusion that abortion was not such a bad thing after all? I suppose he would have been plunged into severe psychic distress. Fortunately there was never the slightest chance of this happening.

This isnâ€™t a standard production from either Left or Right that will make anyone happy. Though the piece implies that Ramesh Ponnuru is in a cult and hints that it is he who has a necro-fixation it is not totally unsympathetic either.
