Closeup 1, 2006

[Closeup 1](http://www.closeup1.com/) has revamped their [website](http://www.closeup1.com/) and is ramping up for their 2006 edition, though for a poetically inclined folk this introduction does translate somewhat manically into English:

> Dreams & Talents  
> Confidence & Aspiration  
> Voice & The Microphone  
> A Nation & Its Youth  
> You, us and the youth of  
> Bangladesh – together we  
> created history with  
> Close Up 1 in 2005.

Of course, just like the first season of *Survivor*, the first season of *Closeup 1* is special. The initial participants will go down in history….
