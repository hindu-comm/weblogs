Hot for missionary?!?!

A random hot chick approached me and started talking to me on the street, real aggressive like. I was pretty taken aback until I realized she was a Jehovah’s Witness, though I didn’t comprehend that until I looked at the literature she gave me. I don’t really know what she said, and I left the literature in the coffee shop where I got my morning fix, but this is certainly the first time that I’ve been approached by a smokin’ JW. But I don’t know if it’s good for the spread of the faith since I doubt this individual induces moral rectitude in most males who she approaches with a bright smile. Of course she could take it to the next step, in the late 4th century though the emperor was Christian the Senate in Rome was the redoubt of pagan males. Nonetheless, many of their wives were Christian, and they raised their children in that faith.
