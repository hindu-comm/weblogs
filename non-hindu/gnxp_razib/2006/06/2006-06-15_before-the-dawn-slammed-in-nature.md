Before the Dawn slammed in Nature

Readers know that I don’t have a totally positive [opinion](http://www.science-spirit.org/newdirections.php?article_id=634) of [Before the Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200793/geneexpressio-20/102-9529791-1661752), but [this hatchet job](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7095/full/441813a.html) in Nature is out of control, it stinks of “[The Sociobiology Study Group](http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/19/feb01/pgross.htm).” Full text below the fold, I’ll let readers point out the issues….

> **In Your Own Image** >
> Care must be taken when looking for natural selection to explain the > evolution of human behaviour. >
> Kenneth M. Weiss and Anne V. Buchanan review Before the Dawn: > Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors by Nicholas Wade >
> In Before the Dawn, journalist Nicholas Wade explores the “lost > history of our ancestors” from a genetic viewpoint. He presents a > compilation of scenarios that are meant to explain the evolutionary > origins of human behaviour and social structure during the past 50,000 > years, discussing archaeological findings but mainly focusing on how > genes can reveal the ‘hidden’ past that can’t be inferred from fossils > or archaeology. He uses examples ranging from the first wearing of > clothes and the origin of hairdressing to the evolution of language, > race and intelligence. >
> These inherently interesting and smoothly presented tales of progress > towards the human present will doubtless captivate many readers. > However, what could have been a tempered and timely treatment of an > important subject is, in our view, regularly undermined by Wade’s > determination to find simplistic natural selection behind every trait, > and by a lack of attention to issues that are known to inhibit a > credible understanding of complex traits, never mind their evolution. >
> Wade’s explanations commit various well-known errors, such as equating > correlation with causation and extrapolating from individual traits to > group characteristics. Often his arguments and trait choices are laden > with Western-oriented value judgements. The following are a few > examples of the kinds of problematic scenario that can be found in the > book. Wade suggests that until recently racial variation has not been > the subject of scholarly pursuit, and confidently asserts that there > are five “major” races, identified statistically by neutral markers > (from a genome that he assures us is 97% “filler”), yet “the alleles > involved in differentiating the human population are likely to be of > the selected kind not the neutral kind”. He also states that stressing > genetic racial differences as he does is “objective” and scientific, > but stressing human similarities is “political”. Wade argues that > Europeans resist ‘mad cow disease’ because their ancestors were > selected for cannibalism. He also says that Jews were selected for > higher intelligence than other peoples because of the calculational > demands of money-lending. He suggests that high intellectual skills > are a genetic adaptation that occurred only after the origin of > settled societies in places such as Europe. And he says that the > Chinese as a “race or ethnic group” excel at ping-pong, which should > encourage researchers to look for a genetic explanation. >
> Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. In The New York > Times on 15 January 2006, Wade warned against journalists being too > ready to accept “overstated or wrong” claims from the science > literature, but in too many places where it makes a difference he has > ignored his own advice. A journalist doesn’t create facts, but he does > select what to repeat and how to colour it, and Wade is long on > speculating about what “is reasonable to assume”, and short on > circumspection of his own, or anthropologists’, yarn-spinning. Most of > the scenarios he reports have not been rigorously tested, nor is it > clear how they could be. The book has many internal inconsistencies, > and one can easily find contrary evidence or readily construct > alternative ‘just so’ stories that invoke the same genetic scenario > and the same kind of reasoning. >
> How could this subject be better treated, without denying the > importance of genes in human traits? For a start, evolutionary > arguments should be based on sufficiently credible, consistent and > compelling scientific evidence. It is easy to claim that a trait is > due to natural selection, but responsible selection-based arguments > should have substantial experimental mechanistic support, at least for > the fact of selection. That’s not the state of most current evidence. > Indeed, after 50 years of investigation, we can’t convincingly > demonstrate selection for most of the red-blood-cell diseases, other > than sickle-cell anaemia, that are probably coevolving with the strong > selective force of malaria. Other best-case scenarios for human > genetic adaptation, such as adult lactase persistence and skin colour, > are also incomplete. Explaining selection is particularly problematic > for behavioural traits because of the powerful role of culture and > facultative ability, which is probably what human evolution really > favoured. Human phenotypic changes can far outpace genetic ones, > making it challenging to know whether such traits are even genetic, > much less what they ‘evolved for’ millennia ago. >
> In addition, assertions of genetic causation should be built on what > is already known about the difficulties of explaining complex traits, > including behaviour or intelligence. The extensive literature > documenting the subtleties of such traits undermines simplistic > ‘evolved for’ scenarios, but Wade largely ignores it. The aetiology of > complex traits is influenced by environmental factors as well as > variation at multiple genes, greatly attenuating the causal impact of > individual genes. We are far from understanding either the genetic > architecture or the evolution of complex biological traits, even in > the best data from experimental organisms unaffected by the blur of > culture. Intensive gene mapping has typically failed to identify more > than a fraction of even the genetic variation, much less all the > variation, in such traits. The effects of experimental genetic > manipulation in laboratory animals routinely vary significantly even > among the few strains tested, and the life experiences of > litter-mates, twins, inbred animals and clones are far from identical. > Despite this sobering knowledge, Wade claims example after example of > ‘genes for’ traits. >
> But why not just enjoy the sport of fanciful speculation, even if the > arguments leak like sieves? Because it’s not just sport. Positions on > genetic determinism often correlate with social politics, and few of > us are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that > his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that “to falter > in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness”. He seems to > be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political > correctness. But we should never become casual about how comparable > ‘slopular’ science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning > by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many > decades ago. Wade’s post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long > march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the > (currently) dominant culture, insist that we look starkly at life in > the raw and not blink at what we see. But given today’s limited > understanding of complex traits, too often what one sees is oneself.
