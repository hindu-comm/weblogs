Too much prosopagnosia – personal communication

I received an interesting email from the lead researcher on the work reported in the earlier post on prosopagnosia:

> Dear Razib, I appreciate your comments (and scepticsm) about our > reported work and the thoughts about continuums (aspergers/autism). > One possibly clarifying point — Face recognition is just one aspect of > face specific processing. Humans are are also adept at judging > emotion, mood, intention, age, attractiveness in faces. Its our > experience that the majority of prosopagnosic individuals (with some > notable exceptions) are pretty much normal in performing these > arguably more important perceptual chores. Their problem is in > recognizing faces, particularly faces out of context. This can occur > frequently in modern urban society with its crowds, great mobility > plus the surfeit of facial images. **It probably occurred less often > in traditional societies, thus reducing selection pressure.** Best, > Ken

In other words, the frequency of this problem should vary with demographic history of the population that the individual is drawn from.
