Why blog about science?

[Chris](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/06/why_blog_about_science.php) has an [excellent post](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/06/why_blog_about_science.php) up about the “why” and “what” in regards to science blogs. I have already sketched out why I blog in the generalities, it is really a function of my egoism. The one thing I would add, or elaborate, in regards to Chris’ post is that I do think science blogs play a very important role in adding a layer of intellectual granularity to the understanding of educated and science savvy folk of **specific fields**. If you encounter science purely through popularizations, no matter how well written they are you might get a distorted sense. As an illustration, as Chris has noted himself, [George Lakoff](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/06/hello_science_blogs.php) is probably the eminent cognitive psychologist/linguist in the minds of most well educated people who take an interest in the sciences of the mind (especially on the Left where his “framing” analysis has become popular). ’nuff said.  
**Update:** Chris [responds](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/06/why_blog_about_science.php) to my response by reiterating his point about reaching out toward a broader audience. I generally agree with the tactics he advises, but, I would add one thing: **Chris and I focus on fields which are *contingent* upon findings and assumptions derived from other fields**. So, I see [Mark Chu-Carroll](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/) (Math), [Chemblog](http://scienceblogs.com/chemblog/) (Chemistry) and [Janet](http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/) (Philosophy) as more relevant targets for outreach. Myself, I address a topic (genetics) of great **interest**, but to *really get* what I’m talking about a basic (very basic!) understanding of probability is a necessary precondition.
