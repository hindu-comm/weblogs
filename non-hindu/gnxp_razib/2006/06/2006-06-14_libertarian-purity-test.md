Libertarian Purity test

Every few months I take a political test just to see where I “fit in.” [Jason Soon](http://www.badanalysis.com/catallaxy/) reminds me of [The Libertarian Purity Test](http://www.bcaplan.com/cgi/purity.cgi). Funniest question?

- 58\.  Should the courts be privatized?  
    
  Yes  
    
  No  

I scored 35, “Your libertarian credentials are obvious. Doubtlessly you will become more extreme as time goes on.” They probably got the directionality wrong, but oh well….
