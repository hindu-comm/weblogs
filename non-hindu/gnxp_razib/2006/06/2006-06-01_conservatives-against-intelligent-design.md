Conservatives against Intelligent Design

[Brown Gaucho](http://www.indiancowboy.net/blog/) seems to have [set up a petition](http://www.indiancowboy.net/caid/) under the heading “Conservatives against Intelligent Design.” I am the [first signer](http://www.petitionthem.com/default.asp?sect=detail&pet=2780). Come now [John](http://olimu.com/), why not make it official?  
Update: John [not only signed](http://petitionthem.com/?sect=detail&pet=2780), but he linked from [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2RlOWVhNGIzMDk5M2IwYzVhMDlhYmM0N2Q4MmU3ZjQ=).  
There have been some questions regarding whether I am a “conservative.” I don’t know, I am actually at this point a very milquetoast libertarian. But, I am not big on labels and I will accept what people term me, and many say I am right-wing or conservative. As a “person of color” my attitudes toward racial and cultural issues (against affirmative action, against identity politics, pro-Western civilization) put me firmly on the Right. Years ago the “black conservative” Shelby Steele would object when people termed him as such because he considered himself a liberal, who for the record was opposed to school prayer and was pro-choice. But several years ago he just gave up, because as a black man in America it became clear to him that there was only one set of issues that determined his politics in the eyes of the rest of the country.  
As for evolution and the Right, I pointed out in my post titled [The Anglican origins of Neo-Darwinianism?](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/anglican-origins-of-neo-darwinianism.php) that the leading light of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis, R.A. Fisher, was himself a Tory and an Anglican. The connection between right-wing politics, evangelical Christianity and anti-evolutionism might seem fundamental and obvious to modern Americans, but there is nothing self-evident about these correlations. Rather, they are the product of particular historical circumstances and confluences of contingent events. More on this topic later….
