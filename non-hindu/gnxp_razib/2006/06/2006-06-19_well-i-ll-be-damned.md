Well I'll be damned…

I imagine regular readers of GNXP are pretty familiar with [Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_weinberg) (HWE): if a population is in HWE and we have a two allele locus with allele frequencies *p* and *q*, then the frequencies of the two homozygote genotypes and the heterozygote genotype are *p*\**p*, *q*\**q*, and 2\**p*\**q*, respectively. To maintain HWE over time, textbooks generally list five necessary conditions:

1\. Random mating  
2. Large (read: infinite) population size  
3. No mutation  
4. No gene flow  
5. No natural selection

Obviously, these conditions aren’t met in any population, but a lot of times we can say “eh, close enough”. But it turns out the first condition is actually not necessary at all. That is, certain non-random mating patterns lead to equilibrium as well.

This was brought to my attention by [this paper](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/genetics.106.057042v1?papetoc), which shows that, in a single round of non-random mating, HWE can be achieved in a population without a change in allele frequencies. In it, the author references [another paper](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/119/3/731) by Li, which derives several patterns of non-random mating that maintain HWE. So, as the author says, “thus Li’s contribution and this one completely remove the necessity of random mating as a requirement for the establishment and maintainence of HWE”.

The practial import of this? Probably close to null. But an interesting fact nonetheless, and a revealing look at how slightly incorrect (random mating is still sufficient for HWE, just not necessary) information can get passed through the generations.
