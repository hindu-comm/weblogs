What was Francis Collins “thinking”

RPM got me thinking about two things today. First, [what’s up with the new picture](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/upload/side_view_toon_small.JPG). Second, [Francis Collins’](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/06/francis_collins_opens_mouth_in.php) is repeating his experiences with religion. Four points

- The equanimity of his religous patients in the face of cruel fate
  fascinated him - He was struck by the arguments in C.S. Lewis’ *Mere Christianity*
  (i.e., “Christians can make rational arguments!”). - An epiphany as he was hiking through the Cascade mountains.

This is an area where you have to be careful to distinguish between the reasons people *sincerely* believe they believe in *x*, and the real causes at work here. Psychologists have long known that people can be primed toward particular preferences through manipulating environmental inputs, but when asked *why* they made the choices they made most humans can sincerely offer you a complex and plausible sounding rationale. I believe that religious belief at any moment in time is shaped by a large number of factors. But, many people will claim that one particular “reason” is the root of their belief, whether it be reading the Bible, the Cosmological Argument or a personal “experience” with the divine. I do not doubt the sincerity of these assertions, the problem with examining these beliefs about *religion* though is importance that individuals will ascribe to their assertions. This was, I believe, the issue that John Derbyshire was getting at in his [review](http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm?frm=3190&sec_id=3190) of Ramesh Ponnuru’s new book when he stated “It would be an astounding thing, just from a statistical point of view, if, after conducting a rigorous open-ended inquiry from philosophical first principles, our author came to conclusions **precisely congruent with the dogmas** of the church in which he himself is a communicant.”
