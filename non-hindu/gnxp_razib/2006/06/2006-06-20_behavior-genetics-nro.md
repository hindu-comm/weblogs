Behavior Genetics & NRO

Over at [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com/) at *National Review Online* John Derbyshire has been getting into a debate with his colleagues over [Judith Rich Harris’](http://home.att.net/~xchar/n2a/n2a.htm) work, and her two books [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20/102-3605398-8339304) and [No Two Alike](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393059480/geneexpressio-20/102-3605398-8339304). I find it amusing when scientific controversy comes crashing into the punditocracy, though I think it is also a good thing. To frame the issue properly, there is consistent evidence that the majority of non-genetic variation in personality is due to ***non-shared*** (i.e., non-home) environment. Judith Rich Harris proposes that peer groups account for this non-shared environment, though this is more a hypothesis than a definitive conclusion derived from the research. With that in mind, here is the debate in rough chronological order….  
**Update:** Final, final, final [response from John](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2Y0MjE0ZDZjYzEzNzc0YTZiZjRmODVkM2YzODczMTE) (he promises).

  
Derb expresses [skepticism about fathers](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGRhMmU5ZmE2Y2I4OGYzNjhjZWY4MGM3MmYwNDY5MjA=) in response to a Rich Lowry column, [The Father Effect](http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTJhMzRhMmIxM2I0MjI3NTM2ZDRhZmZhNDExOGQwY2M=).  
Jonah [defends bourgeois values](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=M2NkM2YyOWMxYzM0ZmViZWUyM2EyNTExOWMwYmMyZDU=).  
Derb [responds with the importance of uncomfortable truths](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTI3OTc5ODc2MTQxYjczNjQ4ZDk2YTIxOWE2NTVhZTc=).  
Jonah [defends politics against pitiless science](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTQxNDM5OTk2OTI1MjYzM2IyM2EwYjIxMDIxNmM5ZTg=).  
Derb [responds at *length*](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWU3ZmE1NWFkYjA0ZTkyOWMyMjQyYTQyNGFhNjQ1MWY=).  
Derb [posts an email](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzhhZjg3OWUwZjk1ODFhMWRlZDNhNzYyODE1MjYxMjc=) and [clarifies](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTIyYmRiZjcxMmIzNDEwNzQwMDhiMGZjZmZhNDhmYjQ=).  
Jonah [doesn’t believe in the science Derb is pushing forward](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmVhYWUwMjczMjY4ODgxNTczZDBiNTIyZmNkNmI5NmU=).  
Derb [attempts a wrap up](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTY3ZjMxN2FlZDY2YzZhZTIzNTI5OTU3OWYzZDE5ZGQ=).  
Rich Lowry [jumps in](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Yjc3Zjg5MzhhNWJjYTY2NzNkY2RkYjljOWM4Mjg3NjU=) to defend his column.  
Now Derb [calls a ceasefire](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGI4NjZlOWJiNWRjODIwMjRlYTUyNzlkZjk3ZjMyMzQ=).  
John Podhortez [throws in the odd *ad hominem*](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTA2MDM1ZjMzYThkNzNmMmIwNTdiNDU0NTM4MzkyODM=).  
Derb [clarifies Judith Rich Harris’ credentials](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDEzMTI3YWFiMmZlYjgzOTRmYTMyZGJhYzFmMjlmZTY=).  
Jonah pulls the [*environment of evolutionary adaptedness* card](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTlmODk3MTY1YTEwMjIzOGM3NWVkZTUxMTk4NjBjM2U=) (he doesn’t call it that, but that’s what he means).  
The [denouement declared](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmUwNDI5MjYwMzdhNGM5ZWNjZGQzNjgxY2RkNzk1NGU=) by Derb.  
I am posting the back & forth because I think it is a good thing when a journal of **opinion** wades into the sometimes murky waters of contemporary “fact.” And, in regards to these questions, note that evolution is assumed to be a fact! Derb did show some courage challenging the assumption by social conservatives that a traditional nuclear family (read: fathers) are a necessary pre-condition for socal normalcy. Now, I consider Judith a friend, so I’m biased and I won’t offer you my opinion about the whole debate, you can connect the dots. If you are curious, [read my 10 questions](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-judith-rich-harris.php) with Harris. There has been [some discussion](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/standing-up-for-noble-lie.php) of the topic over at my other weblog as well.  
Remember, “Seek knowledge even unto China.” The conclusions may not always be palatable, but whatever values we hold, we must wrestle with reality.
