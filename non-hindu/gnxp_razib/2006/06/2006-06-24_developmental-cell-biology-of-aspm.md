Developmental cell biology of ASPM

[  
Aspm specifically maintains symmetric proliferative divisions of neuroepithelial cells](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0604066103v1):

> â€¦Our results demonstrate that Aspm is crucial for maintaining a > cleavage plane orientation that allows symmetric, proliferative > divisions of NE cells during brain development. These data provide a > cell biological explanation of the primary microcephaly observed in > humans with mutations in ASPM, which also has implications for the > evolution of mammalian brains.
