For shame – "Evolutionary Genetics"

MC Coffee Mug, a recent contributor to this weblog, posted this [comment](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/115010705408380949?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/mendels-garden-genetics-carnival.php#1114953) below:

> i’m not upset that there’s not an evolutionary genetics category.. > half the science blog content on the web is either about dinosaurs and > hobbits or it’s myers-esque “oh i’m so incensed because people don’t > get evolution” rants.. i would be quite happy to read a genetics > carnival that never mentioned any of that junk..

Dinosuars and “Hobbits” are **not *evolutionary genetics***, they are paleontology. The last phenomenon, well, I don’t know what it is, but it isn’t evolutionary genetics either. Here is a [rough sketch](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-genetics/) of pre-postgenomic evolutionary genetics, here is [the future](http://www.genome.gov/10001688) that has been prophesied. Here is a great [evolutionary geneticist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.A._Fisher) from the 20th century, and [here is a profile](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/bruce-lahn.php) of a young evolutionary genomicist. Repent heathen!

Evolution + genetics = evolutionary genetics  
Evolution + geology = paleontology  
Evolution + atheism = rants

Get your systematics in order!

We believe in mutation, the maker of all  
We believe in selection, the shaper  
We believe in drift, the divider  
And we believe migration, the unfier  
In these parameters do we believe, four natures of one essence  
And so shall evolution be glorified in the eyes of Creation
