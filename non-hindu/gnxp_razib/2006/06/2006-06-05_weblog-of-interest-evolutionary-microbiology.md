Weblog of interest – evolutionary microbiology

[Science Matters](https://science-matters.blogspot.com/) is run by Jennifer S. Griffin, a grad student in mol bio at Princeton who is looking to pursue a career in science writing and the weblog is a first run. She “addresses aspects of pathogenesis and evolution of microbes, with a focus on viruses.” Anyway, I assume this is one weblog that won’t go dead, and since germs are of interest to many here I suspect we’ll be seeing some bookmarking soon.
