Remember to rinse with mouthwash

Here’s a ScienceDaily [report](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060529082223.htm) from the latest annual meeting of the [American Society for Microbiology](http://www.asm.org/), where one team of researchers presented evidence of which genes in gum disease pathogen P. gingivalis empower it to invade the arteries, where it likely contributes to atherosclerosis. I couldn’t find the poster / abstract at the ASM website, but [here](http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/full/73/9/6169?view=long&pmid=16113342) is a pretty recent journal article from the same research department on the topic. So, rather than representing just another correlational study that provides more evidence for Cochran & Ewald’s [new germ theory](https://www.google.com/search?hs=fah&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=Infectious_causation_of_disease.pdf&btnG=Search) (popularized by Ewald in [Plague Time](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385721846/sr=8-1/qid=1149784137/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-9026137-0767822?%5Fencoding=UTF8)), this research illuminates the mechanism behind the process. God knows what other garbage is living in your mouth, so remember the mouthwash — or perhaps soon, a [mini light sabre](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7228&feedId=online-news_rss20) for attacking oral cavity microbes.
