Neandertal mtDNA

Here is a [press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-06/cp-1yd060106.php) of a [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4K424V9-7&_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2006&_alid=410351287&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6243&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000056308&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2148430&md5=8976a1763fc821eccfb1ec3f12095ea9) which reviews Neandertal *mtDNA* diversity. Here is the first paragraph:

> The cohabitation of Neandertals and modern humans in Europe about > 35,000 years ago has stimulated considerable debate regarding > hypothetical admixture. Recently, sequences of the hypervariable > region-1 (HVR-1) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 9 Neandertal > specimens dated between 29,000 and 42,000 years ago from dispersed > locations have revealed the genetic diversity of Neandertals around > the time of the cohabitation 1, 2, 3 and 4. The genetic signatures > before and after contact with modern humans were found to be similar. > They fall outside the range of modern human genetic diversity and show > no specific affinity with modern or Paleolithic Europeans \[5\]. Such observations are generally taken as strong evidence for the ‘Rapid replacement’ model for the origin of modern humans 4 and 6, though further evidence is needed to completely exclude admixture \[7\].

Remember, this is mitochondrial DNA, a genealogy on one locus can tell you only so much, and one should be cautious about conflating it with demographic history….  
The “money shot” below the fold:

> The pairwise distance distributions within humans, as well as between > humans and Neandertals, are closer and overlap more extensively for > more recent Neandertals (p \< 0.001) than for the Scladina specimen > (Figure 2). While the diversity of the more recent Neandertals is > similar to that of modern humans worldwide, the sequence from Scladina > reveals that more divergent Neandertal haplotypes existed before > 42,000 years ago. This could suggest that Neandertals experienced > genetic drift as demographic bottlenecks eliminated the > phylogenetically more recent (i.e. less expanded) haplotypes from > populations. Consequently, the most likely conserved Neandertal > haplotypes could also be the phylogenetically most ancient (i.e. the > most closely related to the common ancestor of modern humans and > Neandertals). This could explain the shift towards modern human > pairwise distributions observed between 100,000 and 40,000 years ago. > Whatever this shift should be related to cohabitation, climatic > changes, or any subdivision of populations, the Scladina sequence has > revealed that the genetic diversity of Neandertals has been > underestimated. Thus, more Neandertal sequences than the six presently available and longer than 100 bp are needed to fully understand the extent of the past diversity of Neandertals.
