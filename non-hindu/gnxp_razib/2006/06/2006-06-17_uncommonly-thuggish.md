Uncommonly thuggish

I take a guilty pleasure in reading the work of creationists and intelligent design proponents. I can’t really get worked up over them, even if I try – I just find it a relaxing pastime. Perverted, I know. (Make no mistake, I use Darwinism as one of my litmus tests for reasonableness, but I can’t really work up actual anger with creationists.)

Still, seeing Intelligent Design poster boy Bill Dembski in action is quite something. Here is [an exchange over bird evolution](http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1227) over at his Blog, “Uncommon descent”:

> You’re mis-construing the importance. It’s not “we’ve found a missing > link, therefore evolution is proved”, but rather “we’ve found a fossil > ancestor that tells us something interesting about how birds evolved”. >
> There’s a good write-up on Living the Scientific Life. Bob

Here is the answer from the always-friendly management:

> Wanna see me turn YOU into a missing link? -dt

Gotta love that spirit of open scientific debate!

PS.  
Bill appears to have some [trouble with mathematics](http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/06/something_rotte.html) too…  
DS.
