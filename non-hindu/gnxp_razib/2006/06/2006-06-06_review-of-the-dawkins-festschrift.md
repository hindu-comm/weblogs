Review of the Dawkins festschrift

Nick Wade [reviews](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/science/sciencespecial2/06dawk.html) and summarizes the new *festschrift* to Richard Dawkins, [Richard Dawkins : How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//0199291160/geneexpressio-20/).

The list is long and varied. Dawkins has influenced psychologists and philosophers, but note that there are biological scientists on the list. A while back I left Dawkins off the top 10 evolutionary biologists list, but that doesn’t mean I think he is an inconsequential individual. As a public intellectual he is top notch and wide ranging, but people shouldn’t confuse that for original scientific research, which is a different brand of inquiry and analysis than what Dawkins has specialized in. Surveying the list above it could be argued that Richard Dawkins has had a broader impact than he would have had if he focused on research in evolution and ethology after obtaining his Ph.D. One might even ponder the intangibles, for instance, how many biologists were inspired by reading one of Dawkins’ books? These are not trivial matters. I would like to think that W.D. Hamilton’s body of work would speak for itself, but reading any of Dawkins’ books and you see that his prose brings to life the science of others. Sometimes packaging matters a great deal.  
Some would argue that Dawkins’ evangelistic atheism is infantile (I am more neutral on this question than others, I think it is an important contribution to the chorus of disparate voices), others might find his Leftish politics uncomfortable (man is a political animal, deal!), while there are those who would take issue with his gene selectionist paradigm. But, no matter these dissents, Dawkins does express, I believe, the **central tendency** of modern evolutionary biology. He may be a bit zealous, and his way with words might elide over problems with his own paradigm, but in the end the question to ask, **has he been good for science?** I believe yes, and unequivocally so.
