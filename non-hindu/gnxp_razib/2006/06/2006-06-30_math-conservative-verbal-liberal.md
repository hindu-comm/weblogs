Math = conservative, Verbal = liberal

I have a post on my [other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/06/math_makes_you_more_conservati.php) where I’m asking about why mathematical disciplines tend to more conservative in academia. I know there are many references in JSTOR but I’m strapped for time, so could people please dump references into the comment box? I am especially interested in the psychometric finding (I’ve seen it!) that shows high IQ individuals stronger in math than verbal skills tend to be more conservative while the inverse are more liberal. Thanks ahead.
