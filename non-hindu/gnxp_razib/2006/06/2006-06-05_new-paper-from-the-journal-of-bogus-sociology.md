New Paper from the Journal of Bogus Sociology

[From the abstract](http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2006/06/05/when-are-sociological-studies-going-to-learn-about-this-modern-genetics-stuff/):

> OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the relationship between the parental use of sunscreen products and the skin color of children in first grade. >
> METHODS: Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth were > analyzed. Families with complete data on parental sunscreen use and > child skin color were included in the analysis. Sunscreen use was > categorized into â€œHigh, Medium, Low, Noneâ€? by quartiles. Skin > color was a continuous variable assessed by computer analysis of skin > images. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate > the relationship between parental use of sunscreen products and child skin color in first grade, controlling for gender, race, maternal education, income/needs ratio, marital status, parental income, and child behavioral problems. >
> RESULTS: A total of 2742 children, 81.3% white, were included in the > analysis. Children of High sunscreen-using parents (n=1652) had an > increased risk of being light-skinned, compared with children of No > sunscreen-using parents (n=241, odds ratio: 45.2, CI 33.4-63.8). The > same association held, to a lesser degree, between less extreme sunscreen categories. Of the covariates, only race was significant, but a substantial effect between parental sunscreen use and child skin color remained. >
> CONCLUSIONS. Among the 4 sunscreen use categories, High sunscreen use > was associated with the highest risk of being light-skinned among young children. Understanding the mechanisms through which parental use of sunscreen are associated with skin-color risk may lead to the development of more comprehensive and better-targeted interventions.

It’s funny because it’s [true](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/117/6/2047).
