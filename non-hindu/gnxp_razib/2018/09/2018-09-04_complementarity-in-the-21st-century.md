Complementarity in the 21st century

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chantryguild.jpeg?resize=173%2C290&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chantryguild.jpeg?resize=173%2C290&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H90L7TM/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=qzCF96mmYzLHDX7O9BxGTQ&slotNum=33&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)The late Gordon R. Dickson wrote a series of books in a (mostly) future history termed [The Childe Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GS9FLJM/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=qzCF96mmYzLHDX7O9BxGTQ&slotNum=33&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). I’ve read a substantial number of the books in this series, and it’s rather uneven. On the whole, I would say that the earlier books are better than the later works. Dickson died before he could complete the series, but I don’t think that’s really that big of a deal, because the books are only loosely connected. I read the novels and short stories of the series all out of order, and it wasn’t a problem.

One of the interesting aspects of the universe is that **there are separate human cultures/ethnicities that inhabit different planets and specialize in different economic tasks**. If you look closely, the system doesn’t make economic sense, but that’s OK, we’re talking a setting for space opera.

Of the “splinter cultures,” two of them inhabit planets very close to each other in the same solar system, Newton and Cassida. Newton is home to pure scientists, while Cassida is a world of applied engineers. In [Young Bleys](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H26FUH8/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=dmQOtstfvXlRIKzzvyIv4A&slotNum=0&imprToken=qzCF96mmYzLHDX7O9BxGTQ&slotNum=33&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)it is stated that the engineers of Cassida admire and envy the scientists of Newton.

My point in posting about this is to a great extent I imagine that the United States of America will be the “Newton” of our world for a while longer. But, other nations will be will Cassida (you can guess which), and others the Friendlies. I don’t know who the Exotics or Dorsai might be, and the analogy might breakdown there.
