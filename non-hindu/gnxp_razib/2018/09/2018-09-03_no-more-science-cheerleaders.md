No more “science cheerleaders”

*The Guardian* has a weird portion of their [valedictory](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/aug/31/farewell-to-the-guardians-science-blog-network) to their closing down of their science blogging network:

> But nevertheless, the end of the science blog network comes at a time > when, perhaps more than ever, there is a need for strong, critical, > evidence-based science journalism. We find ourselves in a moment in > history that is dominated by fake news, cherry-picked data, and a > culture in which the stories we tell ourselves – **the ones that tap > into our own *limited experiences* and beliefs** – trump facts and > evidence. In the age of the internet search engine, everyone believes > that they have become the expert – all it takes is a quick google, and > your first ten hits constitute an apparently unequivocal evidence > base. Somehow, we have lost the ability to take a step back, to try and be objective about the information that is presented in front of us, especially if we are faced with something that we already hold a strong opinion about. >
> This is why good science writing is so important. **We don’t need > science cheerleaders, telling us how everything is awesome, or showing > us cutesy pictures of a cluster of stars with some inane motivational > slogan pasted over them.** We need journalists who are willing to get > their hands stuck into the data, to uncover the real stories that new > research tells us, and explain the motives of the scientists that are > doing that research. There is good research out there, and there is > poor research. There are good scientists, and there are bad ones, and > we need honest and **expert science writers to do the ground work in separating the signal from the noise**. The science blog network here might be coming to a close, but that doesn’t mean that there is no longer a need for excellent science communication….

The [author](https://twitter.com/PeteEtchells) has some experience with how science blogs work, obviously. So I’m genuinely a little confused at these characterizations.**A lot of people who have blogged about science do so from a critical perspective.** There are some things that science journalists can do that scientists are not good at. Look at the [investigation of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking). Calls were made, emails were read. This is what journalists do.

**But the reason that the controversy blew up in the first place was that scientists on Twitter and [blogs](https://andrewgelman.com/2017/02/03/pizzagate-curious-incident-researcher-response-people-pointing-150-errors-four-papers-2/)were talking about the issue.** Is a blog like [Neuroskeptic](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/) a “science cheerleader”?

To some extent, I think science journalism itself is more liable to be a “science cheerleader.” There are great journalists who have a particular beat and can write with deep knowledge on a topic. But these are exceptions. A lot of science journalism is simply rewriting press releases!
