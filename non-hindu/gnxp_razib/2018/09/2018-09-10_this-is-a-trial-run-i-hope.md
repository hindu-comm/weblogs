This is a trial run (I hope!)

[Early Pleistocene enamel proteome sequences from Dmanisi resolve Stephanorhinus phylogeny](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/10/407692):

Dental enamel, the hardest tissue in vertebrates, is highly abundant in the fossil record.

Dmanisi. If that doesn’t mean something, look it up!
