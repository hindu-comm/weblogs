I think that’s pretty funny. Since I don’t have that sort of human, it wasn’t my idea. Obviously, [Photo 51](https://dnageeks.com/collections/frontpage/products/rosalind-franklin-photograph-51?utm_source=open_thread_9302018&utm_medium=dnageeks)t-shirts are still on the[DNAGeeks website](https://dnageeks.com/collections/frontpage/products/rosalind-franklin-photograph-51?utm_source=open_thread_9242018&utm_medium=dnageeks).

Patrick Wyman [does not recommend](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/d2acc5d0-ad7b-4d3d-b236-7f1aed4b5799) [The Silk Roads: A New History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00XST7IX2/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=eb-Oguv4R44qHu7pheyFbA&slotNum=30&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). The killer observation for me is that whenever Patrick knew a lot about the topic the author was kind of wrong or off. This is an incredibly important sign for me. If you don’t have this still, you probably need to get to a point where you know enough about a topic. Just pick one, any topic. Additionally, he observes that 40% of the book deals with 20th and 21st century history. That’s also a big no-no for me. Contemporary history is well covered in our society. We have a presentism bias.

Christopher I. Beckwith is kind of cranky, but he’s learned and interesting.

Valerie Hansen’s [The Silk Road: A New History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008YGWQT0/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=Zccfhym7GC0leQMIsLEOEw&slotNum=30&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is one I’d also recommend. It’s more focused on archaeology and the earlier period before 1000 AD. Hansen also lacks the long narrative ambition of Beckwith’s treatment, but if you want to know how Sogdian merchants rolled during the Tang dynasty, this is for you.

Lee Jussim asked on Twitter what counts as “white” today since so much social justice discourse (SJD) revolves around the concept. My response is basically “white” is what is necessary for you to win an argument (though another element now is that if you are Muslim you are not white, no matter how white you look, just like if you have a Spanish surname, you are not white either somehow). Here is how it works:

Italians are white: the ancient Romans were white people who oppressed and executed a marginalized person of color, a brown Palestinian named Jesus.

Italians are not white: Until after World War II Italians were actually not viewed as white, and had to “become white” (or, they had to become people who think they are white). They were even [lynched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_14,_1891_New_Orleans_lynchings)!

The takeaway is that sophism is a feature, not a bug. That’s why I’m so good at faking this discourse.

As usual with Trivers, it’s crazy.

Of all Trivers’ books though, I would really recommend [Natural Selection and Social Theory: Selected Papers of Robert Trivers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195130626/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=Wy8yomiGwFrbmAu7xW6KRw&slotNum=30&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). There’s a lot of science and biography in that work. Anecdotes about W. D. Hamilton in particular I enjoyed.

Greg Cochran wrote up a review in [Quillette](https://quillette.com/2018/09/25/forget-nature-versus-nurture-nature-has-won/) with the expected title, [Forget Nature Versus Nurture. Nature Has Won](https://quillette.com/2018/09/25/forget-nature-versus-nurture-nature-has-won/). Nathan Comfort in *Nature* wrote [Genetic determinism rides again](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06784-5).

Stuart Ritchie was not happy with Comfort’s review:

> Another disgracefully smear-filled–not to mention factually sloppy–review of a genetics book from Nathaniel Comfort. Why do Nature keep asking this guy to write for them? <https://t.co/QwNjk9U1st> >

The review is as bad as you’d think. He doesn’t seem to know the science, but that’s a feature, not a bug, for the sort of review he’s going to give. It’s useful for me because I can note who retweets and “likes” the review, as these are people who I will ignore on all things genetics indefinitely.

A bigger question that I asked a few liberal academic friends: **with all the concern over eugenics where’s the widespread objection among the usual hand wringers about noninvasive prenatal testing and widespread abortion of fetuses that test positive for Down Syndrome?** In the Nordic countries nearly 100% of fetuses which test positive are aborted. In France about 75%. In the United states 70%.

My personal suspicion is that academics are much more concerned about future and vague eugenical specters. Not those activities done freely and through the proactive choice of people of their own class and likely liberal politics. Burn a few Robert Plomin’s at the stake, but make sure you don’t jeopardize your colleagues’ dreams of having a “healthy” baby.

[Overlooked factors in the analysis of parole decisions](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/42/E833). Basically it looks like the old result that judges are harsher before lunch is an artifact of who is seen before lunch (prisoners without attorneys tended to be seen before lunch).

Unless I have looked at the original study, I’m starting to just shy away from retelling results published through peer review. Studies really need to have sample sizes in the title. Small sample sizes are OK in some contexts, but so often they are used to get away with stuff.
