Listened to [Carl Zha and Nathan Myers](https://www.patreon.com/clash_civ)‘ podcasts. About China and the Silk Road.

The podcast [Two for Tea with Iona Italia and Helen Pluckrose](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1417717946) has an interview with my friend Sarah Haider.

Panel Confronts China Over Reports That It Holds a Million Uighurs in Camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/world/asia/china-xinjiang-un-uighurs.html). It’s short, but if you don’t want to read, **there are major reasons to be skeptical of the 1 million figure as being credible.** I think it’s likely that the Chinese government is targeting Uyghurs for re-education, partly because there’s a long history of that sort of thing. But the Kashgar region, in particular, strikes me as extremely unrepresentative, due its particular nature (far more Uyghur and Muslim than any other area of China).

Some people have asked me about books about Central Asia. Here are some I’ve found interesting, [The Silk Road: A New History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008YGWQT0/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fdm8U-1w4fi0FdFs3oQ2QA&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164), [Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004UGKKBE/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fdm8U-1w4fi0FdFs3oQ2QA&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164), and [Lost Enlightenment: Central Asia’s Golden Age from the Arab Conquest to Tamerlane](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00F8MIJMQ/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fdm8U-1w4fi0FdFs3oQ2QA&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

Peter Frankopan’s [The Silk Roads: A New History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00XST7IX2/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=fdm8U-1w4fi0FdFs3oQ2QA&slotNum=38&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is supposedly good, but I haven’t read it.

I don’t know the last time I linked to *Salon*. I subscribed to *Salon premium* in 2002…but I’m pretty sure I let it lapse early in my blogging. But here I go, [A witch hunt or a quest for justice: An insider’s perspective on disgraced academic Avital Ronell](https://www.salon.com/2018/09/08/a-witch-hunt-or-a-quest-for-justice-an-insiders-perspective-on-disgraced-academic-avital-ronell/). There’s a lot of “score settling” in this piece…the author hired Ronell, who turned on him and swallowed his department.

A certainly number of professors have, are, and will, engage in sexually inappropriate relationships with their graduate students. Ronell seems likely to be in that class, but the more interesting aspects are of the story are:

1\) That prominent fashionable professors, such as Zizek and Judith Butler have defended her (Butler had a follow-up equivocation, but who knows, perhaps it’s just performative).

2\) Ronell is a certain type of academic who everyone who has been in academia has heard of or experienced. **The depiction in the *Salon* story makes her seem like a total psychopath who suborns the mission of the institution toward the service of her self-aggrandizement.** This is a certain type of professor. A certain type of business person. A certain type of middle manager. We all know of these people. It’s not surprising that they exist in the academy. But, I do wonder if the transparent fixation on style above substance in the field of scholarship, “deconstruction”, that Ronell operates within allowed her selfish and narcissistic tendencies to flourish in a manner it wouldn’t have if she was engaging in supervising laboratory work or archival research.

[Will Saudi Arabia Cease to Be the Center of Islam?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/opinion/saudi-arabia-islam-mbs.html). This piece cites [The Idea of the Muslim World: A Global Intellectual History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWDZGMV/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B06XWDZGMV&linkCode=w61&imprToken=r1HDTFOBbWxku5P.fNnr6Q&slotNum=0). I think it underestimates the cultural prestige of West Asians within Islam.

[The genetic history of the Iberian Peninsula over the last 8000 years](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2018/09/isba-2018-abstracts.html):

> The Iberian Peninsula, lying on the southwestern corner of Europe, > provides an excellent opportunity to assess the final impact of > population movements entering the continent from the east and to study > prehistoric and historic connections with North Africa. Previous > studies have addressed the population history of Iberia using ancient > genomes, but the final steps leading to the formation of the modern > Iberian gene pool during the last 4000 years remain largely > unexplored. Here we report genome-wide data from 153 ancient > individuals from Iberia, more than doubling the number of available > genomes from this region and providing the most comprehensive genetic > transect of any region in the world during the last 8000 years. We > find that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers dated to the last centuries > before the arrival of farmers showed an increased genetic affinity to > central European hunter-gatherers, as compared to earlier individuals. > During the third millennium BCE, Iberia received newcomers from south > and north. The presence of one individual with a North African origin > in central Iberia demonstrates early sporadic contacts across the > strait of Gibraltar. Beginning \~2500 BCE, the arrival of individuals > with steppe-related ancestry had a rapid and widespread genetic > impact, with Bronze Age populations deriving \~40% of their autosomal > ancestry and 100% of their Y-chromosomes from these migrants. During > the later Iron Age, the first genome-wide data from ancient > non-Indo-European speakers showed that they were similar to > contemporaneous Indo-European speakers and derived most of their > ancestry from the earlier Bronze Age substratum. With the exception of > Basques, who remain broadly similar to Iron Age populations, during > the last 2500 years Iberian populations were affected by additional > gene-flow from the Central/Eastern Mediterranean region, probably associated to the Roman conquest, and from North Africa during the Moorish conquest but also in earlier periods, probably related to the Phoenician-Punic colonization of Southern Iberia.
