So I’m getting a copy of [Fire & Blood: 300 Years Before A Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07C6TBTV3/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=-fcguqsqEdzOGuYHNc9P5g&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59) tomorrow according to Amazon. But I have a legitimate reason to get this book: we’ll be talking about the “genetics of *Game of Thrones*” soon on [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2), my podcast with [Spencer Wells](https://twitter.com/spwells).

Finally recorded a [second episode](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/) of the [Brown Pundits](http://www.brownpundits.com/) podcast, where we talk about the woman imprisoned for blasphemy in Pakistan and colorism. Mostly it’s Zach talking to be honest since he has a lot more passion about these topics, especially the former one.

This guy is a legitimate University of Chicago biologist. What have you done with your life?

[Demographic histories and genetic diversity acrosspinnipeds are shaped by human exploitation,ecology and life-history](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06695-z.epdf?shared_access_token=Ed13VVB6uW5l2IbpJRO_ONRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OtGptVfNQ9ScwNcATNg7l9ofyn7_E1eWJKlasjZRzgQJciGliY80ACqgcpqNhJUhW519YVZxsbV_yQGHueUkMCYiuB4HtjtL-fLDZwHCQucKcyPMvtAMHHpC4tvVTb5dQ%3D). Pinnipeds.

[Genomic analysis of dingoes identifies genomic regions under reversible selection during domestication and feralization](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/16/472084). An interesting thing is that dogs almost certainly descend from a wolf/wolf-like population, but when they go feral they don’t quite become wolves. Perhaps it would be different if they went feral in northern Eurasia. But the ones in tropical/mid-latitude zones that “de-domesticate” don’t become Eurasian wolves. Perhaps something to do with genetic variation lost, but I think some of it is different selection pressures.

[Sigrid Johnson Was Black. A DNA Test Said She Wasn’t.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/magazine/dna-test-black-family.html) The title comes from an early forensic test that probably used hundreds of ancestrally informative markers. If you read the whole thing you see that the results kept getting closer and closer to reality.

The spread of non-Africans around \~60,000 was responsible for most of the non-African ancestry. But there were probably some “false dawns.”

In relation to Robert Plomin’s [Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07K9KXVM5/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=AwtWQPglgoCf0P4tel06cQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59) probably worth it if you haven’t ever read behavior genetics. But really a lot of it is reemphasizing/reintroducing results from the field over the past generation. Hopefully will write review soon.

[Super-smart designer babies could be on offer soon. But is that ethical?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/19/designer-babies-ethical-genetic-selection-intelligence) I suspect that the vast majority of the customers for many years will be focused on diseases. The best way to have tall and smart children is to select a tall and smart spouse. We might be talking about something different in the 2030s. I’m struck by how little discussion there is from bioethicists and geneticists about [NIPT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5565870/) tests for stuff like Down Syndrome. They’re ubiquitous, but talk is limited generally to pro-life circles.

I might quibble with the subtitle, but he confirms that the Portuguese were indeed huge dicks. The Iberians as a whole were brutal and nasty. Though not as nasty as the Anglo-Protestant “Black Legend” would imply. Mostly they didn’t follow the norms and rules which were present in parts of Asia and the New World between states and peoples.

Is anyone still getting 500 errors very often?

Happy Thanksgiving to Americans.
