It is important because people think it is important. Humans often classify each other by complexion, and it has a high social importance in many cultures.

This tendency starts at a very young age. When my children are toddlers they’ve all misidentified photographs of black American males with a medium brown complexion as their father (for example, my son recently misidentified a photograph of me that was actually the singer [Pharrell](https://www.google.com/search?q=pharrell&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS817US817&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGs46o8tDeAhWBx4MKHeWQBqAQ_AUIFCgC&biw=1596&bih=795)). In termsof my background though, I’m 100% Eurasian in ancestry. On a PCA plot, I’m about halfway between Europeans & Near Easterners and East Asians (I have 15% East Asian ancestry so I’m more shifted to East Asians than the typical South Asian).

Skin is the largest human organ, and we are a visual species. It is an incredibly salient canvas. So it’s no surprise that we use complexion as a diagnostic marker for taxonomic purposes. The ancient Greeks correctly observed that the peoples of southern India have dark skin like Sub-Saharan Africans (“Ethiopians”), but that their hair is not woolly. Islamic commenters regularly referred to South Asians as “black crows”, while European observers of the 17th century noted that the ruling class of Indian Muslims tended to be white (i.e., mostly Turkic and Iranian in provenance) while the non-elites were black (descendants of Indian converts).\*

As early as the 1950s human geneticists using classical methods of pedigree analysis predicted that pigmentation was polygenic, but that most of the variation was due to a small number of loci (see [The Genetics of Human Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59)). In particular, they focused on families of mixed European and African ancestry in British ports with known pedigrees.

When genomic methods came on the scene in the 2000s, pigmentation was one of the first traits that yielded positive GWAS hits as well as population genetic findings related to natural selection. In [Mutants](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031100/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0670031100&linkCode=w61&imprToken=928BaS6eZsUMnNejep9w6A&slotNum=123), written in the middle aughts, the author observed that there wasn’t much known about the basis of normal human variation in pigmentation. This all changed literally a year after the publication of this book. By the middle of 2006, a review paper came out with the title, [A golden age of human pigmentation genetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857289). The reason this paper was written is that a host of studies on European populations had identified several loci which explained a substantial proportion of the intercontinental difference in pigmentation between Africans and Europeans.

The figure is from a very comprehensive review, [Shades of complexity: New perspectives on the evolution andgenetic architecture of human skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.23737?author_access_token=F5g4jNGmxSr93uxLz_AMBE4keas67K9QMdWULTWMo8NacSMxISjLOiDFNl6w20opBLXg_UCxxDHI3rPd9OjxKVfS3PiKveuLlh9p4slHM5JIbOVJFqczWI5uJpAVrw-h). **I recommend all readers of this blog to check it out** (the link is not paywalled), because it does a great job of covering all the bases.

First, it turns out that there are probably as many as 50 loci implicated in skin color variation. Focusing on Europeans, and admixtures between Europeans and West Africans, resulted in a major ascertainment bias and a fixation on a few loci and a few variants within these loci. This was probably the reason that the original pedigree analysis inferred such a small number of loci as well.

Second, one of the major issues with pigmentation is that a core set of genes implicated in variation in melanogenesis seem to have been targeted by selection or been subject to drift again and again, but the mutations within those genes may differ. For example, the locus implicated in blue vs. brown eye-color variation in Europeans is also associated with skin color difference in East Asians, but it is at a different SNP.

Third, African variation is a big part of the story, and it looks as if a lot of the variation in pigmentation in modern populations that have been the targets of **selection in northern Eurasia may have been segregating in the ancestral African populations**. In other words, some African populations may have carried “light” allele variants at low frequencies, and the difference in phenotypes of some Eurasians may simply be the concerted shift in allele frequencies across many loci. Additionally, there is also selection for darker variants in some African groups, such as the Nilotic people, as well as lighter variants in others, such as the indigenous people of southern Africa.

Fourth, there’s still no comprehensive selection story (not much definitive beyond what [I reviewed eight years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20409647)). The authors point out that new work shows in India only 12% of the pigmentation variation is due to differences in radiation exposure, but 42% is due to caste. It is suspicious to me that all of these pigmentation loci often show up as positive hits on selection tests…it is hard for me to think that pigmentation is not being targeted. But, it is not implausible that there could be secondary selection targets due to pleiotropy on these genes. The authors point out that there is no evidence for a universal cross-cultural sexual dimorphism, but there is some local evidence. **Please note that sexually dimorphic characteristics take about an order of magnitude more time to evolve**, because the sexes have to express the trait differentially despite having the same basic genetic character, so the recent selection events are unlikely to be able to drive such a change.

It’s clear from this review that a lot of the work in the next decade, the*real*golden age of pigmentation genetics, is going to involve non-European populations. In particular, I have long been fascinated by the fact that among non-Europeans, blondism seems to be a feature of some Oceanian populations. The genetic basis of this trait has already been established in [Solomon Islanders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=melanesia+human+tyrosinase+gene), but I am curious if it is the same among the Aboriginal people of Australia. Some of the populations in central Australia have long been well known to exhibit this trait, especially in children and women. If it’s the same mutation and haplotype as in the Solomons, then it is a characteristic ancestral to the original Oceanian meta-population.

The yield of this research is relatively straightforward. In forensics, the methods will continue to get better as we have more results from non-European populations. And the evolutionary patterns yielded by tests for selection will be very informative in understanding the adaptive pressures faced by our ancestors. For whatever reason, pigmentation genes get targeted over and over.
