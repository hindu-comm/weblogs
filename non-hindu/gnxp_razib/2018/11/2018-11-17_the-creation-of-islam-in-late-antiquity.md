The creation of Islam in Late Antiquity

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/intheshadowofthesword.jpeg?resize=220%2C321&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/intheshadowofthesword.jpeg?resize=220%2C321&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005IEGKMA/geneexpressio-20)Periodically people ask me my opinion of Tom Holland’s [In the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005IEGKMA/geneexpressio-20). I don’t have an opinion because I haven’t read it. Many years ago I took an interest in the topic of Islamic revisionism, and from what I can tell the field hasn’t moved that much in terms of clarity. Rather, Holland’s project in the book has been to repackage it for lay audiences.

Basically, it seems Holland wants to do to Islam what has happened to Christianity over the past few centuries in the West: **turn it into a natural phenomenon and not part of the numen of the cosmos**. Though a fair number of traditionalist Christian believers exist, many people who say they are Christians are often quite aware of revisionist theories about their religion. It’s not taboo or shocking. It’s just the norm.

Consider Candida Moss’s book, [The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0089LOOF4/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=uKBLvwzIfc6ngKguyCb.vA&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59). Moss is a Roman Catholic, who published [The Myth of Persecution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0089LOOF4/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=uKBLvwzIfc6ngKguyCb.vA&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59) while a professor of the New Testament at Roman Catholic Notre Dame University. As the title indicates Moss challenges one of the foundational beliefs about the rise of early Christianity: “the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.” And yet she remains identified as a Christian, a professor of the New Testament.

And, because of the Dan Brown’s [The Da Vinci Code](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FA675C/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=qn7bEIEBheJy7VnvaZf6EA&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59) many people are aware that the development of early Christianity was to some extent a cumulativeprocess (even though Brown’s description is totally off base).

Before the 19th century, most Christians did not even comprehend that their religion could be viewed in such a critical-rationalist manner. They were not necessarily “fundamentalists” as we would understand them. Some apologists for Catholicism arguing against early scripturalist Reformers even pointed out inconsistencies within the Bible to illustrate the futility of sola scriptura. But, Christians accepted their traditions and beliefs in a relatively innocent manner (though the debunking of the Donation of Constantine occurred rather [early](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine)).

The vast majority of Muslims today are where Christians were several centuries ago. Even liberal Muslims, or atheists from a Muslim background, tend to accept the traditional view as the view which they reject piecemeal or in totality. As for as the origins and rise of Islam and the Arab empires, Hugh Kennedy’s [The Great Arab Conquests](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306815850/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0306815850&linkCode=w61&imprToken=zwvSDsxRlKh4HrW3ZUXxLA&slotNum=163) lays out the traditional received model.

Kennedy’s book focuses on the Umayyads, the first hereditary dynasty of the Islamic world (an earlier book was on the Abbasids-[When BaghdadRuled the Muslim World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JAHG5C/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0306815850&linkCode=w61&imprToken=zwvSDsxRlKh4HrW3ZUXxLA&slotNum=163)).
Kennedy does not write from the perspective of a Muslim historian, but a Western historian who takes the Muslim sources at face value (he acknowledges in the introduction that there*is*a revisionist view, though that is not his book).

Muhammad founds a new monotheistic religion in pagan Arabia, and after his death in 632 the tribes united in the faith explode out of their desolate peninsula. In 636 these forces defeat both the Romans and the Persians. Within a few decades the Muslims rule a vast swath of territory, and in 661 the Umayyad dynasty is inaugurated with the reign ofMuawiya I, who reputation and fame would likely be greater if history had not been written by the enemies of his dynasty. One of the reasons that the Umayyads have a low reputation is that their interpretation of Islam was closely tied to their Arab tribal identity. Their religion was not quite the trans-ethnic one that would flourish under the Abbasids. Some Islamic scholars even called the Umayyads the “Arab Kingdom” (the title “king” is considered un-Islamic).

What is the revisionist story that Holland wants to tell? The outline is simple: in the first two generations after the Arab conquest, the Arabs were not Muslims as we, or they, would understand it. Holland specifically seems to believe that Islam as a religious ideology that bounds together the Arab ruling class of the Umayyad domains crystallized during the reign of [Abd al-Malik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Malik_ibn_Marwan) in the 680s AD. This is fifty years after the death of Muhammed, and nearly four decades after the conquest of the Near East and Persia.

There are is a lot more to what Holland believes went down. To get a good sense, [watch his 2012 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5zxPGk99cM) on Youtube.

Do I believe it? Obviously, I don’t believe that Muhammad is a prophet of God, since I don’t believe in God. But, that doesn’t mean that Muhammad didn’t think he was a prophet of God and that his followers were insincere. The rise of Islam is a fundamentally material affair. There is no magic. That would come later with Sufi saints with miraculous powers.

One reason we can have this debate is that the sources are sparse and vague. This may sound strange to say, but as an example, we have very little written records that come down from pre-Islamic Persia. For our knowledge of the ancient and early medieval world we are faced with three major periods of massive literary production: in Baghdad in the 9th century, under Charlemagne in the 9th, in Constantinople in the 10th. The 7th century was a period of stress and deprivation in the East Roman Empire, as it lost massive territory to the Arabs. But one thing that seems clear is that these **East Romans did not have a clear sense of the Arabs as practitioners of a new world religion that was not Christian**. They were clear that they were ethnic Arabs, but not clear that they were anything but heretics or some sort.

The sparsity of “non-traditional” sources means that revisionists have to engage in deep philological analysis of the extant sources, an enterprise which is beyond the ken of non-specialists to evaluate. I have no strong opinions on whether Muhammad existed or not. Nor am I sure that Mecca and Medina as holy sites were later additions to the history of Islam (revisionists tend to believe that the Arabs emerged out of the Syrian desert, not from further south). **I suspect in a lot of the details Holland is incorrect. But I do not think that the orthodox view is correct in the details either.**

It was messily sectarian. The advance of Islam in the domains under the rule of the Arab Caliphates was uneven. Substantial regions of Iran proper remained under the rule of Zoroastrian kings as lateas the 9th century, and Muslims were probably not a majority in Iran until the 10th century.

The Levant and Mesopotamia had a Christian majority for centuries under the rule of the Umayyads and Abbasids. In [The Rise of Western Christendom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B9RJ89W/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=WoJTeSMXam1TGqDmC.XyLQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=VZl4LlOobvZWxXZC3esBtg&slotNum=1&imprToken=JS0NNcPZHN8qamVV8UZj.Q&slotNum=2&imprToken=.dH2Fd01E.qZxtKu6uAZ6A&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=uMOtrg9ndbiqM02u15WVFQ&slotNum=59) Peter Brown claims that Islamicization in the Near East was associated with Arabicization. That is, once Christian populations switched to Arabic as their everyday language, conversion to Islam became much more feasible.

**Butknowing what we know about other religions it seems implausible to me that Islamic emerged out of the desert in the fully formed manner that Muslim tradition implies**. The rise of Christianity is a clear case of debates, arguments, and gradual rough consensus over a period of decades and later centuries. When it comes to younger religions such as that of the Bahai or Mormonism, we can see in “real time” how religions can evolve after the death of their founders. The Bahai religion has its roots in Shia revivalism, but eventually, it transformed itself into a post-Muslim world religion. Though Mormons retain a Christian identity, their theology is extremely exotic in comparison to the Christian mainstream.

The [Rashidun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun) period and the life of Muhammad may always be mysteries to us, but they almost certainly do point to unlikely events in the Arabian Peninsula (or its liminal zone) which resulted in the military mobilization of Arabs bent on conquest. Islam’s emergence in a form more recognizable to us in the late 7th century may have been an inevitable result of declining cohesion of the Arab conquest elite, and the necessity of an ideology to bind them together, along with notables from conquered populations.

And of course, we know that the 8th and 9th centuries saw the transformation of Islam in a deeper and more thoroughgoing manner, with the shift to the east of the Abbassids and the emergence of the ulema class and the marginalizations of philosophy. But that needed the ideology of empire, and that ideology did not emerge*de novo*from the desert. **Islam did not create an empire, the empire necessitated the precipitation of Islam.**
