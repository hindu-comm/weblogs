Local ancestry deconvolution made simpler (?)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chol.jpg?resize=600%2C552&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chol.jpg?resize=600%2C552&ssl=1)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/07/25/376137.full.pdf)

I’ve been waiting for a local ancestry deconvolution method to come out of Simon Myers’ group for a few years. Well, I think we’re there, [Fine-scale Inference of Ancestry Segments without Prior Knowledge of Admixing Groups](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/376137). Here’s the abstract:

> We present an algorithm for inferring ancestry segments and > characterizing admixture events, which involve an arbitrary number of > genetically differentiated groups coming together. This allows > inference of the demographic history of the species, properties of > admixing groups, identification of signatures of natural selection, > and may aid disease gene mapping. The algorithm employs nested hidden > Markov models to obtain local ancestry estimation along the genome for > each admixed individual. In a range of simulations, the accuracy of > these estimates equals or exceeds leading existing methods that return > local ancestry. Moreover, and unlike these approaches, we do not > require any prior knowledge of the relationship between sub-groups of > donor reference haplotypes and the unseen mixing ancestral > populations. Instead, our approach infers these in terms of > conditional “copying probabilities”. In application to the Human > Genome Diversity Panel we corroborate many previously inferred > admixture events (e.g. an ancient admixture event in the Kalash). We > further identify novel events such as complex 4-way admixture in > San-Khomani individuals, **and show that Eastern European populations > possess 1-5% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central > Asians.** We also identify evidence of recent natural selection > favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the HLA region, across North African > individuals. We make available an R and C ++ software library, which > we term MOSAIC (which stands for MOSAIC Organises Segments of Ancestry > In Chromosomes).

The truth is I’ve only done a quick skim of the preprint and not run the method myself to see how it works. But to be honest I can’t see where the part about Eastern Europeans is in the manuscript (I checked the supporting text)? That being said, if you run a PCA many Northern and most Eastern Europeans are clearly shifted toward East Asians compared to Southern Europeans. So I accept it.

In any case, always remember, **all models are wrong.** But some of them have insight.
