As I said, a pretty good and short history. Recommended.

[CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing scissors are less accurate than we thought, but there are fixes](https://theconversation.com/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-scissors-are-less-accurate-than-we-thought-but-there-are-fixes-100007). I know the focus is on human genetics. And rightly so. But this isn’t going to be as much of an issue in animal and plant breeding.

Great. But I already own it. That being said, I can tell you it’s a pretty good book.

[Against Moral Equivalence](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-against-moral-equivalence/). “The talking heads trafficking in examples of U.S. interference neglect to mention that the goal of American policy has always been to prop up anti-totalitarian, pro-market leaders.” I dislike the tendency of American conservatism to conflate anti-authoritarian and pro-market. The two are distinct (I’m pro-market for what it’s worth, but capitalism is amoral, even though it leads to greater human well-being).

[Confronting Implicit Bias in the New York Police Department](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/nyregion/bias-training-police.html). Implicit bias stuff is [sketchy science](https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html). But people want solutions for social problems.

I got introduced to the “authoritarian personality” in college. I didn’t think much about it, but over the years it seemed pretty clearly a bit rigged. But whatever. Then I read [The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923-1950](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007CJLZWE/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=Mnvq45B.9qIqwVQ3a6fe7g&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=m0OZklw2PrvfVdj7GKuBrQ&slotNum=56). That’s where it comes from. Enough said, right?

[Tides of History](https://wondery.com/shows/tides-of-history/) is a great podcast. Now Patrick Wyman is talking about the “Hundred Years War.”

Should I post “open threads” anymore? It seems that the number of comments keeps dropping. Really “everything” is moving to Twitter nowadays though Twitter is a wasteland.

[A “carvaka” perspective historicity of myth and religion](http://www.brownpundits.com/2018/07/17/a-carvaka-perspective-historicity-of-myth-and-religion/). A long post on [Brown Pundits](A%20“carvaka”%20perspective%20historicity%20of%20myth%20and%20religion%20) by me. Was asked once why I post there and not here, and why here and not there. 45% of the readers of that weblog are from Indian IPs. 5% here. About twice as much traffic here, but much more engagement there (bounce rate 70% vs. 40%).
