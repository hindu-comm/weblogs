The new African “multi-regionalism” & pan-Neanderthalism

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/weallallneanderthals.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/weallallneanderthals.jpg?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1)](https://dnageeks.com/products/we-are-all-neanderthals?utm_source=blogpostweareallneanderthals&utm_medium=dnageeks)We live in times when our understanding of the origin and diversification of modern humans is undergoing great change. **More concretely, our understanding of what it means to be human is transforming.** The terms are overused, but perhaps it could be called a “revolution” or “paradigm shift” between the year 2000 and today.

At the end of 2010 ancient DNA made it highly likely that [people outside of Sub-Saharan Africa had non-trivial Neanderthal ancestry](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full). That is, enough ancestry that it is detectable genomically. I should also add that I think it is highly probable that the good majority of people within Sub-Saharan Africa have Neanderthal ancestry. Some of this is due to recent attenuated Eurasian back-migration (e.g., many West Africans, Nilotic people, and KhoeSan have Holocene gene-flow signals which derive from the agricultural expansions of the past 10,000 years). **But, I think once deep Pleistocene genomes of African humans are sequenced we will see evidence of some Eurasian back-migration at a very ancient date** (there is already some [suggestive inferential evidence of this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/04/362566)).\*

If the Richard Dawkins Foundation can make quid on it, why not the Razib Khan et al. Foundation?

This has all been on my mind due to a review paper in *Trends in Ecology and Evolution*, [Did Our Species Evolve in Subdivided Populations across Africa, and Why Does It Matter?](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30117-4) (OA). If you read this blog closely you’ll see there’s not much new in it. **But, it is a signpost, a marker, of the times we live in.** Here’s the important bit:

> Together with recent archaeological and genetic lines of evidence, > these data are consistent with the view that our species originated > and diversified within strongly subdivided (i.e., structured) > populations, probably living across Africa, that were connected by > sporadic gene flow…**This concept of ‘African multiregionalism’**…may > also include hybridization between H. sapiens and more divergent > hominins (see Glossary) living in different regions…Crucially, such > population subdivisions may have been shaped and sustained by shifts in ecological boundaries…challenging the view that our species was endemic to a single region or habitat, and implying an often underacknowledged complexity to our African origins.

Frankly, I was waiting for someone to use that word. If Richard Klein’s [The Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DNL0IUK/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=CC7It33FRGMEQvnKy0cHkQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=Lbz8sws6-RaaPs9telv5Og&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=m0OZklw2PrvfVdj7GKuBrQ&slotNum=56), published in 2002, was the apogee of the old model, often inchoate and more crisp in **popularization than within the scientific community** that we are all descended from a ***single*** East African tribe, this review paper heralds the emergence of a more complex and pluralistic framework. The emergence of modern humans within Africa then may have been a polycentric gradual and interactive process; not a singular explosion against the firmament of the antique savanna landscape.

By the late 2000s, even before the 2010Neanderthal draft genome paper, it was starting to be evident due to genome-wide analyses of contemporary populations, that the extreme bottleneck clear in non-African populations was much more modest within Africa. That opened the possibility for the existence of deep structure within the continent that pre-dated the “Out of Africa” event. A deeper look at African hunter-gatherers indicated to many researchers that these groups diverged from other modern humans in the range of \~200,000 years before the well. Recent paleontological work has confirmed this genetic insight.

Where we are today is that some people are now arguing for the overthrow of the “Out-of-Africa” idea, whether by replacing it with an “Into-Africa” model of some sort, or resurrecting a more polycentric classical multi-regionalism (“some people” as evident in the increased frequency of emails and Twitter messages I get in this vein). I don’t think we’re there yet, not by any measure. But, it is now in the realm of very unlikely, not extremely unlikely (at least the “Into-Africa” model; it is clear that strong overwhelming demographic pulses from ***somewhere***singular dominate the genome of most modern humans).

\* I don’t think it is all that implausible that some Neanderthal back-migration into Africa occurred at some point in the last \~500,000.
