Doing a [Summer Sale](https://dnageeks.com/collections?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_07232018&utm_medium=dnageeks) at [DNAGeeks](https://dnageeks.com/collections?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_07232018&utm_medium=dnageeks), 20% off with the [GET20](https://dnageeks.com/collections?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_07232018&utm_medium=dnageeks) code. I believe [GNXP-helix themed](https://dnageeks.com/products/gnxp-dna-helix-hat?utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_07232018&utm_medium=dnageeks) stuff is still the most consistent/popular item.

N. Ninian’s [Turn of the Tortoise: The Challenge and Promise of India’s Future](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N7W4XC6/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=HENpjEndALXWVWY4EylQLQ&slotNum=48). It’s a relatively dry book with an academic orientation. No complaint from me. So far the most interesting, and unfortunate, thing I’ve learned is that Indian men will take a 50% pay cut to work in a white-collar as opposed to blue-collar manufacturing job. Ninan contends that this may be due to caste aversion to manual labor. Men who have lower-paying white-collar jobs have better marriage prospects than those who have higher-paying blue-collar jobs.

[James Gunn Fired From ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ Franchise Over Offensive Tweets](https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/). I’ve seen some people suggesting that you need to evaluate the “whole person” and that “people grow.” **These are almost always the same people who gleefully crucify anyone to the Right of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for anything they’ve ever said in any context**. I see no end to this cyber-Maoism until cultural “mutually assured destruction” becomes reality. To maintain civilization we must be barbarians!

This elicited outrage. I have opinions on this because I’m confident that among the population I’ve been a top 1% utilizer of libraries over my lifetime. I’ve seen slowly as libraries transform from book repositories to internet access portals and community centers. But, **a minority of the population using the library is still using it for books**.

And of that minority, many are nerdy kids for whom the library is a window upon the whole world. True, the internet is great, but the internet is broad and shallow. The minority of overutilizers of the book lending function of the library probably make a big impact in other ways later on in their life.

Before the age of 12, I probably had my parents buy me about a half a dozen books, ever. I bought more as a teen, and as an adult, I probably buy/purchased half the books I’ve read. This is a “think of the children” issue. Libraries are distribution centers for essential free “gateway drugs” of cognition. Not for most. But for those who care.

Last week on *Secular Right* I wrote [On the semiotics of secularism and nakedness of village atheism in the culture war](http://secularright.org/SR/wordpress/on-the-semiotics-of-secularism-and-nakedness-of-village-atheism-in-the-culture-war/). As I told a friend of mine, people were tweeting almost word-for-word the exact same Islamophilic sentiments in the Left-progressive Twittersphere (he was one of them). Reactions to Richard Dawkins have become tribal measuring sticks. It’s tiresome for many apostates from the Islamic religion. Most Left-progressives don’t care about Islam or Muslims that much. They just care that they’re “tolerant” and follow their crowd as to who is, and isn’t, marginalized (1.8 billion Muslims, marginalized!).

[Sexual Dichromatism Drives Diversification Within a Major Radiation of African Amphibians](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/22/372250).

If you liked the [Stuart Ritchie podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight/e/54065967) from a few months back, you need to listen this week. If you subscribed I don’t need to remind you. Also, if you are subscribed to my [total content RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed) or follow my [“gnxp posts”](https://twitter.com/gnxp_posts) Twitter, you know I’ve been pushing my work-blog content into those feeds now (since people keep complaining that they’re missing them). Initially, I kept my work-blogs more “lay-friendly,” and they are still more soft-touch than the stuff I put here, but I’ve noticed that the more technical one still get shared a lot. I’ll have a write-up of a paper that’s going to be quite big (mega-sample size) out on the work-blog this week.

Looks like a justification for the two-fold cost of sex (the male part):

> Sexual dimorphism predicts not only diversity and diversification but > also extinction risk – animals with sexual dimorphism have decreased > extinction risk!

[Inferring Continuous and Discrete Population Genetic Structure Across Space](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2018/07/19/genetics.118.301333). This was out as a preprint a while back. These issues require more thought than people in pop-genomics have been doing.

[Black American Culture and the Racial Wealth Gap](https://quillette.com/2018/07/19/black-american-culture-and-the-racial-wealth-gap/):

> … Consistent with the Nielsen data, they found that blacks with comparable incomes to whites spent 17 percent less on education, and 32 percent more (an extra \$2300 per year in 2005 dollars) on ‘visible goods’—defined as cars, jewelry, and clothes…. >
> Next, they asked if education accounted for the differences in > financial habits by limiting the comparison to middle-aged families > with advanced degrees. Surprisingly, they found that the racial gap in > financial health-scores didn’t shrink; it widened. Highly-educated > Asian families scored 3.49, comparable whites scored 3.38, comparable > Hispanics scored 2.94, and comparable blacks remained far behind at 2.66. Thus, the study authors concluded, neither “periodic shortages of time or money” nor “lower educational attainment” were the driving forces behind the differences in financial decision-making.

The author of this *Wired* piece is Virginia Heffernan, who I know for having an impeccable [pedigree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Heffernan#Background_and_education), but whose writings are substantively often total tripe. Heffernan, who has a Ph.D. in English from Harvard, once wrote a weird piece titled [Why I’m a creationist](https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-im-a-creationist-141907217.html), which begins “As a child I fell in love with technology, but I have to admit I never fell in love with science.”

In any case, Holmes’ case is clearly one where a person from a upper-class WASP background with Stanford connections leveraged all that into a lot of money. Heffernan’s attempt to transform it into a gendered issue is totally predictable, but also incredibly reductive.

Nathan Lents’ new book, [Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07432D5GB/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ASML6htQ.1KSp55thdt8gg&slotNum=49), looks interesting. Here’s a [write-up](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/five-questions-about-human-errors-for-intelligent-design-proponents/) by Lents’ in [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/five-questions-about-human-errors-for-intelligent-design-proponents/).

Though I do wonder if Creationism as a cultural force has lost some steam. After all, conservative Protestants are probably more worried about their catastrophic losses in the culture wars right now than somewhat abstruse meta-scientific questions. I mean, I have more Twitter followers than[The Discovery Institute](https://twitter.com/DiscoveryCSC)!

If you want to analyze Tibetan genotypes, I converted some files I found in the Jorde lab website to [plink](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fq8c3w2frr42td3/Tibetan.zip?dl=0). It has an OK overlap with HGDP.

What podcasts do you listen to?

Also, the India ancient DNA story should get a major breakthrough within the next week or so. “Watch this space” and all that.
