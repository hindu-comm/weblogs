What Neanderthals tells us about modern humans

Reich details exactly the process of how his team arrived to analyze the data that Svante Paabo’s group had produced, and how they replicated some peculiar patterns. In short, eventually, they concluded that modern humans outside of Africa have Neanderthal ancestry, because the Neanderthal genome that Paabo’s group had recovered happened to be subtly, but distinctively, closer to all non-Africans than to Africans.At the time, the group reported that Neanderthal ancestry was relatively evenly spread across non-African populations, which lead them to suggest that it was likely a singular admixture event early on during the expansion phase of modern humans.

Nearly a decade things have changed. **There is a consistent pattern of West Eurasians having less Neanderthal ancestry than East Eurasians.** That is, Europeans have lower Neanderthal ancestry fractions than Chinese (South Asians are in between, in direct proportion to their West Eurasian ancestral quantum). There have been a variety of arguments and explanations for why this might be, which fall into two classes:

1.  Neanderthal ancestry was purged more efficiently from West Eurasians
    due to larger effective population sizes (selection is stronger in
    large populations). 2.  There may have been multiple admixture events into modern humans,
    or, gene-flow into West Eurasians diluting theirNeanderthal
    ancestry.

**But what if all these arguments are *mostly* wrong?** That’s what a new preprint seems to suggest: [The limits of long-term selection against Neandertal introgression](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/04/362566):

> Several studies have suggested that introgressed Neandertal DNA was > subjected to negative selection in modern humans due to deleterious > alleles that had accumulated in the Neandertals after they split from > the modern human lineage. A striking observation in support of this is > an apparent monotonic decline in Neandertal ancestry observed in > modern humans in Europe over the past 45 thousand years. **Here we > show that this apparent decline is an artifact caused by gene flow > between West Eurasians and Africans**, which is not taken into account > by statistics previously used to estimate Neandertal ancestry.

Nevertheless, > these models recapitulate previously observed signals of selection > against Neandertal alleles, in particular a depletion of Neandertal > ancestry in conserved genomic regions that are likely to be of functional importance. Thus, we find that negative selection against Neandertal ancestry has not played as strong a role in recent human evolution as had previously been assumed.

The older statistic held that West Eurasians and Africans were distinct clades which had not had gene flow in \~50,000 years. Using simulations the authors argue that the best fit to the statistics that they do see, the earlier flawed one, and the current more robust one, is a situation where **a population of West Eurasian origin mixed with Africans starting about \~20,000 years ago.**

This explains why there was a consistent decline in Neanderthal ancestry: the earlier statistic’s model assumption got worse and worse over time, and so began to underestimate Neanderthal ancestry more and more. There was continuous gene flow into Africa over the past 20,000 years.

Not everything that came before is wrong. It could still be that there are multiple admixtures. And, the authors do agree that some selection for Neanderthal alleles has occurred. It’s just that it’s not the primary reason for the decline of Neanderthal ancestry in West Eurasians.

One point the authors make is that though an early European farmer was estimated to have \~40% Basal Eurasian, its Neanderthal estimate is still quite high. Iosif Lazaridis [points](https://twitter.com/iosif_lazaridis/status/1014666334209236994) out that this is an old estimate, and the Reich group now puts it closer to \~25%. Additionally, another recent preprint put the fraction [closer to \~10%](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/23/287268). With such low values, it is possible that Basal Eurasians may have had low Neanderthal fractions, but that that was a marginal effect on the aggregate West Eurasian ancestry quantum from Neanderthals.

**I think the bigger thing to consider is that our understanding of the relationships of modern humans is roughly right, but there are lots of nuanced details we’re missing or misunderstanding**. Ancient DNA from South Africa, for example, shows that modern Bushmen all seem to have exotic ancestry compared to samples from 2,000 years ago. But what about samples from 20,000 years ago?

We have the best [temporal transect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27135931) from Ice Age Europe, and in this region, there are many population turnovers and admixtures. It seems implausible that Europe is entirely exceptional. The West Eurasian gene flow event dated to \~20,000 years ago is curiously coincidental with the beginning of the recession of the [Last Glacial Maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum). To get a better understanding of the relationships of Pleistocene people looking at paleoclimate data is probably useful. The ancient DNA will come online at some point…and unless you think ahead, we’re going to be surprised.
