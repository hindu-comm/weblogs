Render unto Caesar worldly goods

Now that I’ve received it I realize that I read a few chapters of [Imperial China 900-1800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674445155/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=OnI1Q4oKxJKAl2JPTTx1DQ&slotNum=54)in 2008, before abandoning the project due to sloth. Older and wiser.

As I’m reading this book, I’ve been giving thought how I would respond to this [comment](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2018/07/19/how-the-fall-of-the-roman-state-and-persistence-of-roman-culture-led-to-the-modern-world/#comment-9230):

> …not only were priests an independent power source from kings, but no > matter how deeply interrelated each was in principle independent of > the other, with their own independent spheres: the secular sphere and > the religious sphere. This fact too was important in shaping the modern world, in that **modernity assumes that government is fundamentally secular in a way that would have been unfamiliar to pre-moderns outside of Latin Christendom.**

This is a common view. Fareed Zakaria, for example, expresses something similar in [The Future of Freedom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WJOW6M/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=0wMhbfsY-2aIN21.VoB-ug&slotNum=54), whereby the emergence of an independent Western Church after the Fall of Rome created space for secularization and the development of liberal democratic institutions through decentralization of power.

And yet after having just read [History of Japan](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005LPUEPK/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B005LPUEPK&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7Yy5iZkksBF5IJwbM.ptgQ&slotNum=8), and reading again about the [Battle of Anegawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga#Battle_of_Anegawa), where Oda Nobunaga completed a chapter of his crushing of institutional Buddhism as an independent power in Japan, I wonder what the above even means. A standard model would argue that in East Asia religion suffused life, philosophy tended toward monism, and there was no separation between this world and that. The Emperor of Japan descended from the Sun Goddess. The Emperor of China was the Son of Heaven, though Heaven was not conceived of in an anthropomorphic sense. And yet the kingship of nations such as France and England have exhibited a sacral nature, and to this day the monarch of England is also the head of its established religion.

One of the many things that stuck with me from that book was just how radical in regards to religion the federal government established by the American Founders was at the time. While the American states had all had an established religion, due to the pluralism of the new nation, and the personal secularism of many of the Founders, no consideration was given to privileging religion on the national level. This concerned many leading thinkers, some of whom suggested that simply declaring Christianity in the general sense the national religion would have been sufficient (and for all practical purposes Protestant Christianity was the national religion, even though church-state separationists such as Andrew Jackson were punctilious in making this not a*de jure* matter).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thereformation.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thereformation.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AWGIRPW/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=ueIut32ANW5ntMoy7jX.FQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=OnI1Q4oKxJKAl2JPTTx1DQ&slotNum=54)With hindsight, it seems clear that having a “national religion” only makes sense in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation, and the collapse of the religious system of Western Christendom during the medieval period. The medieval Western Church was characterized by a great deal of diversity and variation. But something happened during early modernity, whereby that variation produced too many tensions and factionalized. Eventually, this shattered the tacit understandings and compromises which allowed for external unity. In nations where monarchs supported Protestant Reformers, national churches emerged, and become official arms of the state for all practical purposes. In Catholic Europe, a reaction produced a newly muscular and standardized church, which stood opposed to the new official Protestantismon very similar terms. The Roman Catholic church remained international, but it also became the national churches of nations as diverse as Poland, Ireland, and Spain.

Though many people assert that the Roman Empire became “officially” Christian with the conversion of Constantine, or perhaps during the reign of Theodosius the Great at the end of the 4th century, the reality is that the Roman Empire was not a totalitarian state. The dissolution of paganism occurred more through slow decay and death, as the cessation of subsidies from the state starved elite paganism, and persistent missionary efforts blanketed the population with nominal Christianity.

The assertion above that “government is fundamentally secular in a way that would have been unfamiliar to pre-moderns **outside of Latin Christendom**” always strikes me as strange [![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/xunzicompletetext.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/xunzicompletetext.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7T53ayp7AG8o--19tDImFA&slotNum=54)because of my familiarity with Chinese history and philosophy, and the interpretation of how the Chinese seem to have viewed “church”-state relations. It is often said that the Chinese are superstitious, but not religious. In other words, what China lacked in the vigor of organized religion, it made up for in widespread belief in supernaturalism. This is broadly correct, but the same could be said for the West for most of its history. That is, many pre-modern peasants were not religious as much as they were superstitious, and their Christianity was a thin skein upon folk beliefs.

The issue rather is with the cultural elite, and what their beliefs were. There is a line of argument that philosophical dualism, and a particular sort of disenchantment with the world and a rationalism, was pregnant within Western Christianity, and came to fruition with Calvinism and modern forms of Catholicism. In the ancient world, Christians believed that magic was real, and that the pagans worshipped true supernatural forces, but that these were rooted in the devil. The argument proceeds that in early modernity this belief gave way to more rationalist views, whereby God remained true, but non-Christian beliefs were rooted in falsehood, rather than demons. Magic was now simply trickery.

And yet[History of Japan](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005LPUEPK/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B005LPUEPK&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7Yy5iZkksBF5IJwbM.ptgQ&slotNum=8)notes that even before Oda Nobunaga’s crushing of the Buddhist clerical powers of the 16th century the society was going through broad secularization, as popular and elite enthusiasm for religion abated. Though the Tokugawa regime enforced Buddhist registration by families across Japan, this was a measure that enabled control and regulation, not one which promoted religion as such. Japanese intellectuals during this period were influenced by currents skeptical of supernaturalism that had its roots in Chinese Confucianism, and this in its turn can be found to have prefigured by anti-supernaturalist threads as far back as Xunzi.

My own materialist bent leads me to suggest that in fact, secularization in early modernity at the two antipodes of Eurasia were natural and likely inevitable developments with mass societies and more powerful states. A coercive state did not need to rely on supernatural power to persuade a populace, and the workaday nature of bureaucratic governance, in any case, would not reflect positively upon a religious order that was fused with that state.

Naturally, others will have different views. But one of the reasons I am such a fan of [Peter Turchin’s project](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamics/) is that I tire of semantic definitions as the axis around which arguments hinge. I am usually unconvinced by the erudition of my interlocutors because in most cases I don’t get a sense that they know more than I do, even though perhaps they may, in fact, be in the right. Rather than calculating, argumentation is often a way for two individuals to assess each other’s knowledge base and sophistication. If there is parity, there will never be a resolution, because personal qualities are more relevant than reality.
