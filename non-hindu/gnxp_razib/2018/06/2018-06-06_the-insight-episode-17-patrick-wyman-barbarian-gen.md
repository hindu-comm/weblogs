The Insight, Episode 23: Patrick Wyman, Barbarian Genetics

Patrick is now a professional podcaster for *Wondery*, but I got to know him originally through comments on this weblog. Patrick is a historian of Late Antiquity. We originally encountered each other in 2010 after I had just finished a period where I was originally interested in the topic of his professional study, and he was interested in paleogenetics.

As Patrick said before we began recording, this podcast was a long time in coming. More precisely, the time is right, and it will get more right. More and more preprints like Amorin et al.’s [Understanding 6th-Century Barbarian Social Organization and Migration through Paleogenomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/20/268250) will be coming out in the next few years. Ancient DNA extraction is cheap enough now that it will be used to explore historical lacunae, for example, what happened in sub-Roman Britain?

This is a materialist treatment whch makes clear how thoroughgoing the collapse of economic production was across much of the Roman world. Then, Peter Heather’s [Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0035KD36U/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=7VmqSNhnar72HXMDUr7QgQ&slotNum=77&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55), anticipates some of the work coming out of genetics. Heather at the time was making the case that many of the barbarian groups that entered the Roman Empire were in fact coherent ethno-cultural entities. That the period of the “folk wandering” were literally folk wanderings.

As a complement, one might check out Hugh Kennedy’s two books on the early history of Islam, [The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live In](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0080K3RDO/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=7VmqSNhnar72HXMDUr7QgQ&slotNum=77&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55) and [When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World: The Rise and Fall of Islam’s Greatest Dynasty](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001JAHG5C/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=7VmqSNhnar72HXMDUr7QgQ&slotNum=77&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55). Kennedy doesn’t present a revisionist view, but that’s OK. Sometimes you need the null model. Like neutral theory.
