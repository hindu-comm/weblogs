The monarch as an expression of the people

The “magisterial” Reformation succeeded in those nations where the king or the most powerful aristocrats defended Protestantism and made it their own.

The process is outlined in Benjamin Kaplan’s [Divided by Faith: Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674034732/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=PQXAQJO0pmncUyAd0PIkkQ&slotNum=0&creativeASIN=0691058873&linkCode=w61&imprToken=HQQ0njNqiReUm8CQvRkIZg&slotNum=247). It was a deliberate campaign to retake ground lost by the Habsburg monarchy and the Catholic Church.

The grinding down of Protestant faith in Hungary left such bitter feelings that Hungarian Calvinists marched with the armies of the Ottomans in the late 17th century during the [Battle of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna). Even today the center of Hungarian Calvinism is in the [far east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Hungary#/media/File:Hungary_2011_Religion.png), which was longest under the protection, neglect and toleration of the Ottomans.

French and Polish Protestants were well represented among the elites and parts of the nobility. Both states offered the Protestants a modicum of toleration, more or less, but in neither instance they did they capture the monarchy. In France, the Protestant Henry IV famously converted to Roman Catholicism, because the monarchy of the French state was tied so closely to the old religion. Polish Protestants, always a minority but concentrated among the upper echelons, slowly lost their position in society over the 17th and 18th centuries, to the point where being ethnically Polish and being Roman Catholic were synonymous. In contrast, the French Protestants suffered a major immediate shock when Louis XIV revoked the toleration and independence that they had enjoyed explicitly. They either had to convert, emigrate, or retreat deep into isolated areas such as the Massif Central.

But did this really hold? Henry VIII certainly dragged an England that wasn’t entirely comfortable with leaving Catholicism, especially in the north, to Protestantism (though not *too* far, as the Puritans would learn!). The Scandinavian monarchs transitioned their nations rather quickly to Lutheranism. The Dutch Protestant minority, motivated, concentrated among elite elements, rebelled against their Catholic Habsburg monarch, but rallied under the Protestant House of Orange.

And yet there were other cases where *cuius *regio,* eius religio* did not hold. Arguably Henry IV’s conversion to Catholicism illustrates that the monarch was not all powerful…but this case is confounded by the reality that his kingship was conditional on his conversion.

In 1613 [John Sigismund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sigismund,_Elector_of_Brandenburg) of the House of Hohenzollern made public his conversion to Calvinist Reformed Christianity. **His Lutheran subjects balked, and did not follow him.** Prussia remained a predominantly Lutheran domain with Calvinist rulers for hundreds of years.In 1697 the [Wettin House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Saxony#Saxony-Poland) of Saxony converted to Catholicism. While a minority of the subjects of the Hohenzollerns were Reformed Christians, almost no Catholics were present in the domains of the Lutheran Electorate. The overthrow of [James II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England#Glorious_Revolution) of England in part due to his Catholicism shows that by the latter half the 17th century *cuius *regio,* eius religio* did not hold.

**The people were self-conscious in having a particular religious identity, and top-down pressure would be met and resisted strenuously.**

It is sometimes stated that nationalism and self-identity emerged as late the French Revolution. I do not agree with this. Rather, I agree with Azar Gat’s position in [Nations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ADP731G/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=k-Db-NijgLdrp2X7Nbyn0g&slotNum=4&imprToken=x6.fJ0qf-tdaMCHqdraK.g&slotNum=75&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55), that nationalism has deep historical and cultural roots. But that does not mean that I believe English self-identity in 1300 is and was the same as English self-identity in 1800. The [Gordon Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots) of 1780 illustrate how a strident Protestantism had become part and parcel of English national self-identity. In contrast, though there were religious conflicts between the early 16th century (with some rural peasants, especially in the north, retaining loyalty to the Catholic religion) and into the period of the English Civil War, the ultimate outcome seems to have been a matter of mobilizing elites, and up until the overthrow of Charles II retaining the favor of the monarch.

**At some point the English monarchy personified the nation. The nation was not simply the extension of the monarch.** Anti-German sentiment during the First World War resulted in the switch of their dynastic name from Saxe-Coburg & Gotha to Windsor.

But it seems like something happened between 1500 and 1750 in much of Western Europe. Nations-states shifted from beingsyndicates of elite interest groups ad powerful individuals, to becoming expressions of popular will and sentiment. This preceded democracy or liberalism by generations, and it was a gradual process. Mass society and identity emerged. Immovable, with its own will.

And this had happened before historically, from Greek democracies to the Roman republic. Polities were reflections of the public. At some point citizens become subjects, and the populace were simply resources from which to extract rents to fund aristocratic positional contests. The information revolution of the printing press, and economic development more generally, changed the calculus. The past came back.

These sorts of dynamics are universal, cyclical, and playing out to differing extents across the world.
