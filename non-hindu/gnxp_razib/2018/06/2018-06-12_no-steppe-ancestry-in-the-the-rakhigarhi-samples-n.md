No steppe ancestry in the the Rakhigarhi samples = non sequitur

I haven’t heard anything definitive, but this is what I ***have*** heard: that the genetics they could analyze indicates continuity, but none of the steppe element ubiquitous in modern North India (and that there was contamination in the Korean lab). The Rakhigarhi samples date to 2500 to 2250 BC last I checked. **That means they shouldn’t have any steppe ancestry if the model of the relatively late demographic impact of Indo-Aryans *after* 2000 BC is correct**.

Basically, the whole article is kind of a non sequitur. I do understand that many archaeologists think there was continuity culturally. And there could have been. But taking into account the genetics of the modern region of India where Rakhigarhi is located, **there was a major demographic perturbation after 2250 BC**.
