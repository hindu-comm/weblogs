In other words, for \$29.99 you can get millions of markers in your exome sequenced, as well as some positions in the rest of your genome. Helix keeps the data, but there will be no kit cost if you see a future app that you want to purchase.

One thing that I’ve reiterated: **it’s a very big book.** A single review can’t really cover many aspects of what Carl touches on, and unfortunately even during the [podcast](http://insitome.libsyn.com/she-has-her-mothers-laugh) I didn’t get to chimeras.

We’re almost at 100 reviews on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) on 10 on [Sticher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight). I’ll stop bugging when we reach those milestones.

It’s been obvious to me that more and more people are [protecting](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets) their Twitter accounts. Instead of a conversation the platform is about snooping on blow-ups and controversies.

Evolutionary, population, and quantitative genetics have been long-term interests of mine, so I love stuff like this. Adding a little genomics would be even better.

[Diverse haplotypes span human centromeres and include archaic lineages within and out of Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/20/351569). Centromeres are crazy.

I will blog about this at some point…and I’ve been making semi-serious/jokey tweets. But people are probably not clear on my “position.” My main irritation about Harvard is the extent of the doublethink that they get away with. Drew Gilpin Faust’s pablum about inclusion and diversity being central values at Harvard is a classic [“Shaggy defense”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_defense). Faust helms a finishing school for the overclass, and as such accepts the necessity of discrimination when it comes to anointing future overlords. Some hypocrisy is necessary for the ruling caste, but the juxtaposition between “neoliberal” reality of what Harvard is, and the “progressive” rhetoric of it presents to the gullible and ignorant public, is starting to become indecent.

Speaking of overclass, Tim Draper is a third generation member of the capital class, and still [defends](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/06/19/vc-tim-draper-sticks-with-elizabeth-holmes-says.html) Elizabeth Holmes.
