Are pants really more comfortable than skirts?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003TSEL1Y/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691058873&linkCode=w61&imprToken=HQQ0njNqiReUm8CQvRkIZg&slotNum=247)Recently I stumbled upon this paper from a few years back, [The invention of trousers and its likely affiliation with horseback riding and mobility: A case study of late 2nd millennium BC finds from Turfan in eastern Central Asia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214002808). Basically, it seems that trousers [emerge with mounted cavalry](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago). The dominance of mounted cavalry in the years after the fall of Rome resulted in the emergence of a trousered elite, and the shift away from the tunics of antiquity.

Today we donâ€™t ride horses, so the utility of trousers in that context is gone. It seems that if you work in blue-collar professions and it cold climates trousers are still useful. **But is there a reason for men in warm climates in white-collar professions to continue going with trousers as opposed to a simple tunic?** Are we just stuck with tradition?
