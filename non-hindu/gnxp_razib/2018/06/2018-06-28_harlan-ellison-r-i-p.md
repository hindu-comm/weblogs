Harlan Ellison, R.I.P.

[I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JVCHEMU/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=MGFqiZ3vcChNDilirAWUMA&slotNum=41&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55) is one of the most disturbing things I have ever read. Over 20 years after reading I still remember how appalled I felt as I finished the last sentence.

Ellison was a powerful writer. Some of his innovations have become cliche (e.g., Ellison pioneered [time travel plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever)s which have now become overused). One thing I remember from Isaac Asimov’s [autobiography](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380754320/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=MGFqiZ3vcChNDilirAWUMA&slotNum=41&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55) was how much he loved Ellison for his loyalty and devotion as a friend.

With his health failing over the past few years it is not surprising he finally died. But he surely lived a very full and eventful 84 years. Ellison made a difference, and he’ll be remembered.
