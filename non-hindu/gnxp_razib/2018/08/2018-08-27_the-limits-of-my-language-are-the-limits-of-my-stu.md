The Limits of My Language are the Limits of My Stupidity

> “**Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range > of thought?** In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally > impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. > Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one > word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings > rubbed out and forgotten.” (1.5.23, Syme)

And more:

> “It’s a beautiful thing, **the Destruction of words.** Of course the > great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds > of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn’t only the synonyms; > there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there > for a word, which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word > contains its opposite in itself. Take ‘good,’ for instance. If you > have a word like ‘good,’ what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? > ‘Ungood’ will do just as well – better, because it’s an exact > opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger > version of ‘good,’ what sense is there in having a whole string of > vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all the rest > of them? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning or ‘doubleplusgood’ if you want > something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in > the final version of Newspeak there’ll be nothing else. In the end the > whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words > – in reality, only one word. Don’t you see the beauty of that, > Winston? It was B.B.’s idea originally, of course,” he added as an > afterthought. (1.5.23, Syme)

[1984](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003JTHWKU/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=9DojSqMxMIi47TCoLHLdkg&slotNum=0&imprToken=N4Lgw0AoqIqcKItQzl6z-g&slotNum=53&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is a great book. But do you remember how it ended?
