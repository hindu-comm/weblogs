[V. S. Naipaul has died](http://www.brownpundits.com/2018/08/12/v-s-has-died/). I never read his fiction. Perhaps I should. Suggestions? People always talk about [A House for Mr. Biswas](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0046A9J9S/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

[Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eo9cbnss01639ud/Khera%20Genome-wide%20polygenic%20score%20Nat%20Genet%202018.pdf?dl=0). ” We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues.” Totally honestly, this is happening way faster than I had assumed it would.

[Relatedness disequilibrium regression estimates heritability without environmental bias](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0178-9).

One thing to remember is that George R. R. Martin was a screenwriter in Hollywood for a period. His writing is a more natural translation to modern visual media.
