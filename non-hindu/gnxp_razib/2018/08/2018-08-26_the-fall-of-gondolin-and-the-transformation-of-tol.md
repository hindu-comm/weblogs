The Fall of Gondolin and the transformation of Tolkien’s world

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fallofgondolin.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fallofgondolin.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CFKN31Z/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=t8G.x9Ml7nuPFwtCfQr.ZQ&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)In a little over a week, [The Fall of Gondolin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CFKN31Z/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=t8G.x9Ml7nuPFwtCfQr.ZQ&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) will be released. This is on the heels of the publication of [Beren and Lúthien](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MG2HOWD/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=8mhWTA5jdcnTqGyBqKkazg&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) last year, and [The Children of Húrin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007978NKG/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=5ldgxkWqYBSFUoO8kGFP9g&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) in 2007. I notice that both of these two books are “Kindle Deals” right now, so they are probably anticipating that getting more people to buy these two books will gin up demand for[The Fall of Gondolin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CFKN31Z/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=t8G.x9Ml7nuPFwtCfQr.ZQ&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

If you’ve read [The Silmarillion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007978PGI/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=8mhWTA5jdcnTqGyBqKkazg&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) these novels are not going to be original. Rather, they’re for the Tolkien completists. But though Tolkien was a traditional conservative who did not look kindly upon the forces of thefree market, I think the fact that Amazon is going to use his work, his world, as source material means that old stories are going to be recycled. Tolkien’s son, [Christopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Tolkien), who at over 90 years of age is nearing the end of his time guarding his father’s legacy. I wonder if these last novels are parting salvos by him before he loses total control.

I was not too interested in[Beren and Lúthien](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MG2HOWD/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=8mhWTA5jdcnTqGyBqKkazg&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)and [The Children of Húrin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007978NKG/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=5ldgxkWqYBSFUoO8kGFP9g&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). But [The Fall of Gondolin](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07CFKN31Z/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=t8G.x9Ml7nuPFwtCfQr.ZQ&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)is a genuinelymore epic tale.

The films in the 2000s were pretty good in my opinion, but what Amazon will do is probably going to totally reimagine how Tolkien’s vision is perceived by a new generation. Reading these novels might be a way to reacquaint oneself one last time with what these works of fantasy meant to people and were meant to be.
