The dual engines of modern science

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lagoon.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/lagoon.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=NJ5KOXHtDPpVqjO9D.ccBA&slotNum=54&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)A few years ago Armand Leroi wrote [The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00INIXJL8/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=NJ5KOXHtDPpVqjO9D.ccBA&slotNum=54&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). Some people immediately made a critique that **actually**, science, as we understand it, is really the creation of early modern Europe. That Aristotle and his fellow Ancients, or physicians and astronomers of early medieval Islam, or the scholastics of the high Middle Ages, didn’t “really” do “science.”

I think most of us understand where this critique is coming from. But, even if you grant the objection if Aristotle was alive today, would he be a scientist? **Of course, he would go into science!** And, he would probably a good one. Perhaps a great one. Why? Because he had the curiosity, cognitive skills, and, there is a culture that would allow him to flourish. To me, the biggest difference between early modern Western science, as it emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, and what came before, is that it was a cultural concert of thinkers, a vast constellation of minds and minions.

In contrast, much of ancient science was driven by singular geniuses.

This brings me to the massive replication effort that just got published:

Mostly good. But [Jonathan Haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt) pointed out how important this makes collaboration and a culture of truth-seeking within the enterprise. [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) has stated that her scientific activism is driven by “communist ideals.” And though I dislike Communism, I do think there is something fundamentally communistic about science. In [Uncontrolled](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007V2VEQO/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=g0Xo-Ol08w-FLKGO-cpLzw&slotNum=54&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) Jim Manzi points out that within the world of science **there are very strong norms about honesty.** A major issue with scientific fraud is scientists are trusting.

But then there is the [von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) factor: **geniuses can accelerate and open up whole landscapes of research**. They do a “different kind of science.” It’s less culturally embedded, and less social and incremental. They are the sparks which fly in the darkness. Ratiocination machines of a different kind and ken from mortal man.

There is the “industrial” aspect of scale, efficiency, and incrementalism. One step at a time into the darkness, cautious and continuous. This is science that Adam Smith would be proud of. International, specialized, and efficient. Optimized.

And then there are the startling breakthroughs. Sometimes those breakthroughs are genius and insight. Consider the story of the emergence of String Theory outlined in Lee Smolin’s [The Trouble with Physics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003WUYP56/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=Bl49MQOmdkq0c36fxy-Exw&slotNum=54&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). Smolin is a skeptic of String Theory, but in the book, he describes how rapidly it took the scientific world by storm, just by force of its insight and elegance.

In contrast, there are cases such as CRISPR, where several different groups seem to have “stumbled” onto it (this resembles the “rediscovery” of genetics in the early 20th century). The genius here is less in the humans than in what nature had invented, and what humans discovered through trial, error, and luck. Nevertheless, in a few years, CRISPR radically transformed the possibilities in “genetic engineering.”

Going forward, big collaborative science will keep lumbering on. It will play the role that it has played for decades, driving translation, laying the seedbed for innovation. Normal science. But every now and then a spark will fly, and a new flame will explode. Genius still has a role to play in the firmament of human advancement.
