As I’m reading[Imperial China 900–1800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674012127/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B073NP8WT3&linkCode=w61&imprToken=GqkJYB5R0vMIGDdFkrTyeA&slotNum=48), **I’m still thinking most of the readers of this weblog would benefit from doing so as well**. There’s just so much within the book that is food for thought. Though you should read [A History of the Byzantine State and Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M7SP1L7/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=hCSzOVMJmMs.4xCD1vr.Zw&slotNum=2&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) as well!

I find it curious since a lot of scientists and Left-liberals more generally have been attacking it really vociferously recently. To be honest I think it’s kind of a sign that whatever Claire Lehmann is doing, she’s probably doing it well.

The critique some of the writing at *Quilette* is uneven is surely correct, **but that’s true of *lots* of publications.** In those cases, the authors take a hit, but the publications aren’t totally written off. In fact, I see a fair amount of undergraduate college-level material being shared around when they agree with someone’s politics; people only get intellectual snobby when they disagree with the conclusion (this is a big move by [Protagoras on the Prairie](https://twitter.com/heerjeet?lang=en)).

I think more predictable is going to be the critique that Christianity is necessary for liberalism, as implicit in the argument in [Inventing the Individuals: The Origins of Western Liberalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00P0L278/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=aJCQSVs9Mn1o4QIZNceksg&slotNum=46&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

Second, [The Dangers of Ignoring Cognitive Inequality](https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/). This is related to the piece in *The American Conservative*, [The Recruitment Problem the Military Doesn’t Want to Talk About](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-recruitment-problem-the-military-doesnt-want-to-talk-about/).

Like Jerry, I am confused as to why *The New York Times* assigned a literary reviewer with no science background to offer opinions on David Quammen’s [The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075RX2QY4/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=hCSzOVMJmMs.4xCD1vr.Zw&slotNum=2&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

A random question: **what politically liberal podcasts do you listen to?** I started listening to [Pod Save America](https://art19.com/shows/pod-save-america) and it’s just people talking Tumblr and hating Trump. That’s fine, but you can get that elsewhere….

Has anyone been getting page-load errors? I’ve been getting a lot fewer (once a month, rather than once every few days). I think the memory issues may have cleared….
