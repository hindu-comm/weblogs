Consumer Genomics in 2018, beyond the future’s threshold

This was in the wake of the FDA controversy with [23andMe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23andMe#FDA), and continuing worries about DNA and privacy. Today David and I came out with a new comment in*Genome Biology*,[Consumer genomics will change your life, whether you get tested or not](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1506-1).

Really transformative technology becomes beneath comment. As long as we’re having to comment about genomics, it isn’t really mainstream. But I think in 2018 it is much clearer that the 2020s will see legitimate mainstreaming. The numbers speak for themselves. I hadn’t realized in a visceral manner how much had changed since our original comment came out. It’s pretty much an order of magnitude shift.

My hypothesis for why 23andMe plateaued for a while at \~1 million is that that was the sample size which maximized the statistical power they wanted to catch loci of particular effect sizes. In the initial years, 23andMe was not just buying customers with marketing, it was subsidizing the array costs. Today Illumina SNP arrays are well under \$50 (some people say less than \$25) wholesale, so I think at some point in early 2017 they realized even though 10 million wasn’t worth much to them in comparison to 1 million for GWAS, they were going to lose the luster of being “market leader” to Ancestry, who were acquiring customers at a massive clip through their marketing (my understanding is that at some point Illumina was having issues processing the samples that Ancestry was returning to them it was at such high scale; higher than Ancestry had anticipated!).
