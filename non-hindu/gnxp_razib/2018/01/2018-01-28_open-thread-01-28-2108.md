If you want to read something besides [Alexander to Actium](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00UJ7RAY8/geneexpressio-20), check [Dividing the Spoils](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004Y4UTBI/geneexpressio-20).

A heads up, this week on [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) we’ll be talking to [Joe Pickrell](https://twitter.com/joe_pickrell) of [Gencove](http://gencove.com). The main topic will be DNA and ancestry.

[Is the United States the new Saudi Arabia?](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/01/26/is-the-united-states-the-new-saudi-arabia/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=fp) This stuff is crazy if you read books about “Peak Oil” in the 2000s. Also, I really don’t ever want to hear about this stuff from random guys who read these books and thought they had all the answers ever again.

The [100x LED Microscope for Mobile Devices](https://dnageeks.com/products/100x-led-powered-microscope-for-mobile-devices?&utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_01282018&utm_medium=cellphonemicroscope) has been quite popular, and shipping is right now free. Also, we have European vendors for our [t-shirts](https://dnageeks.com/collections?&utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_01282018&utm_medium=tshirts), so shipping is cheaper and faster.

[Following many liberals](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/957695780130906112) on Twitter has confirmed my right-wing identity, though modified by policy beliefs. In particular, far Left people, such as [Matt Stoller](https://twitter.com/matthewstoller?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), seem to make coherent criticisms of capitalism and what it has wrought. Criticisms which I don’t always have a good answer for.

In contrast, moderate liberals, with their mild platitudes and thin policies are not persuasive, but their adherence to sex/race identity politics and smearing of all those to the Right of them as white supremacists means that it’s pretty obvious all of those who are **“Other”** need to band together as one when the time comes. We hang together, or we’ll go to the re-education camps separately.

[The Follower Factory](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html). This makes sense.

[Why Ursula Le Guin Matters](http://www.weeklystandard.com/why-ursula-le-guin-matters/article/2011349).

[Nicholas Christakis](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/956980632881639424) is being treated pretty unfairly. I don’t expect that he’ll get satisfaction. This isn’t the age for honorable men.

[Big Data Comes to Dieting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/well/eat/data-dieting-weight-gain-loss-fat-genes.html?smid=tw-share).

The new [gnomAD](https://gnomad-beta.broadinstitute.org/) is pretty dope.

[Dissecting historical changes of selective pressures in the evolution of human pigmentation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/25/253963). Not sure of the demographic model.
