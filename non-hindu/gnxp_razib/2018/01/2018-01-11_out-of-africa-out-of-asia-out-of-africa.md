Out of Africa-Out of Asia-Out of Africa

As part of the preparation, I’m revisiting some uniparental results, in particular, recent ones. This preprint in *bioRxiv* [Carriers of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup L3 basic lineages migrated back to Africa from Asia around 70,000 years ago.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/13/233502), caught my attention:

> Background: After three decades of mtDNA studies on human evolution > the only incontrovertible main result is the African origin of all > extant modern humans. In addition, a southern coastal route has been > relentlessly imposed to explain the Eurasian colonization of these > African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, from which > all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, > that out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya.

The > oldest M and N Eurasian clades are found in southeastern Asia instead > near of Africa as expected by the southern route hypothesis. The split > of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very similar to the age > of mtDNA L3. A Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa has been > proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E.

It seems better to be the result of a > joint and global replacement of the old autochthonous male and female > African lineages by the new Eurasian incomers. Conclusions: **These > results are congruent with a model proposing an out-of-Africa of early > anatomically modern humans around 125 kya. A return to Africa of Eurasian fully modern humans around 70 kya, and a second Eurasian global expansion by 60 kya.** Climatic conditions and the presence of Neanderthals played key roles in these human movements.

It was really hard for me to parse all the coalescene and phylogenies here. I know some readers are pretty well versed in this area so I’m curious about critiques and reactions to the above.
