Out of Africa to Out of Eden (well, perhaps not yet)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lone_survivor.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250023300/geneexpressio-20)The recent African origins hypothesis for modern humans had several things going for it. First, most of the old fossils that look like modern humans were in Africa. Chris Stringer and others were pushing the African origins of our modern lineage before genetics came to the fore. But of course, you also have DNA. The mtDNA, Y, and autosomal DNA, which tends to show a pattern where Africans are more diverse, and non-Africans are nested within phylogenies of Africans.

In the 2000s the “Out of Africa” model got a little out of control. The stylized narrative was that a small tribe of East Africans developed some genetic mutation that allowed them to exterminate all other human lineages (e.g., language). This is best encapsulated in Richard Klein’s [The Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471252522/geneexpressio-20). The British science fiction author Stephen Baxter used this idea as a frame in his novel [Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FA675W/geneexpressio-20)(the innovation in this novel was religion though). In this view modern humanity was an African saltation, a great leap forward.

We’re at a different point now. The idea of admixture and/or introgression from non-African lineages into African modern humans is widely accepted. Additionally, **both** genomic inference and paleontology are pushing the roots of modern humanity much further than \~50,000-60,000 years before the present.

So it’s not **as surprising** to see a paper like this, [The earliest modern humans outside Africa](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/456):

> To date, the earliest modern human fossils found outside of Africa are > dated to around 90,000 to 120,000 years ago at the Levantine sites of > Skhul and Qafzeh. **A maxilla and associated dentition recently > discovered at Misliya Cave, Israel, was dated to 177,000 to 194,000 > years ago, suggesting that members of the Homo sapiens clade left > Africa earlier than previously thought.** This finding changes our > view on modern human dispersal and is consistent with recent genetic > studies, which have posited the possibility of an earlier dispersal of > Homo sapiens around 220,000 years ago. The Misliya maxilla is > associated with full-fledged Levallois technology in the Levant, > suggesting that the emergence of this technology is linked to the > appearance of Homo sapiens in the region, as has been documented in > Africa.

So it isn’t that surprising. Or it shouldn’t be.

But, this reinforces the reality that **anatomically modern humans were geographically already widespread \~200,000 years ago.** I would say that this informs and updates our estimation of the plausibility of the [Jebel Irhoud](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22336) modern humans in Morocco, who flourished \~300,000 years ago. It also makes more sense of the reality that most of the ancestors of the Khoisan likely diverged from other modern lineages \~200,000 years ago (or more, depending on who you talk to). Finally, it makes recent archaeological finds of modern humans or their artifacts in East Asia tens of thousands of years before the great expansion of neo-African humanity50,000-60,000 years before the present much more plausible.

There has been [some](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16046) [genetic](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19792) [evidence](https://www.cshl.edu/neanderthals-mated-with-modern-humans-much-earlier-than-previously-thought-study-finds/) for modern(ish) human expansion before the 50,000 year date. So this isn’t resting only on paleontological evidence.

Where does this leave us? In [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human-fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel) David Reich observes that ‘It’s important to distinguish between the migration out of Africa that’s being discussed here and the “out-of-Africa” migration that is most commonly discussed when referring to genetic data. This \[Misliya\] lineage contributed little if anything to present-day people.’

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brief_history.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brief_history.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1615194045/geneexpressio-20)Obviously, this is an important point. But we know that the first modern humans to settle Europe did not leave any descendants either. The modern human settlement of Europe was still nevertheless important. Second, these early wave humans may have given modern populations adaptive variants that are present at high frequencies in modern lineages.

Finally, there’s the issue that this may reorient our understanding about the demographic origins of human populations. **Ever so slightly our priors as to an African genesis for our modern lineage are getting weaker.** You have two very old modern fossils on the northwest and northeast fringe of the continent. Ten years back the arguments was between those who argued for an East African origin (most), or a minority who favored a Southern Africa one. Now the whole continent, and perhaps even Arabia, are game.

Ultimately, as always, ancient DNA is going to be the final arbiter.
