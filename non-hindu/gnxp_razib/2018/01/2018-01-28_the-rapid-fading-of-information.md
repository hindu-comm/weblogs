The rapid fading of information

> If you’ve used Storify in the past, it’s time to save your stories before they shut down in May <https://t.co/KQfOPZGhgL> >

This crossed my mind when I saw that Storify is shutting down. Or Kevin Drum’s reflections on the changes in [blogging](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/01/a-bit-of-weekend-blogging-nostalgia/).

I’ve put a lot of content out there over the years. Probably on the order of 5 million words across my blogs. Some publications here and there. Lots of tweets. **But very little of it will persist into future generations**. Digital is evanescent.

But so is paper. I believe that even good hardcover books probably won’t [last more than a few hundred years](https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-a-paperback-book-last).

Perhaps we should go back to some form of cuneiform? Stone and metal will last thousands of years.
