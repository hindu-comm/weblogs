None dare call it multiregionalism

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the_last_human.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the_last_human.jpeg?resize=196%2C257&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300100477/geneexpressio-20)[Dienekes Pontikos](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2018/01/out-of-africa-theory-in-crisis.html) resurfaces with a post, [Out of Africa: a theory in crisis](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2018/01/out-of-africa-theory-in-crisis.html). The title is a bit hyperbolic. But in Dienekes’ defense, he’s been on this wagon for over ten years, and the evidence is moving in his direction, not against him. I think a little crowing is understandable on this part.

With that being said, **I think the biggest rethinking that we’re doing is less about *where* modern humans arose (Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East), but *how* they arose.** Some geneticists are quite open to the idea of Eurasian (Neanderthal?) back-migration to Africa several times (and out of Africa several times). Others are positing that a “multiregional” model might actually be about the situation*within* Africa.

A simple stylized model of a rapid punctuated expansion of humanity which replaces other lineages *in toto* is no longer likely. There has been widespread admixture, even though the last major demographic wave seems to be overwhelmingly predominant, at least outside of Africa. But the whole process might result in a much morecomplex history than we had thought.

The [multiregional model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans) is probably wrong on the details. The history of our species is not really phyletic gradualism and anagenesis. But there are also many processes and dynamics which a multiregional model takes into account and anticipates that probably are important in a general sense toward understanding the origin of our species.
