South Asian Genotype Project, update

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sagp_results.jpg?resize=625%2C392&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sagp_results.jpg?resize=625%2C392&ssl=1)  
I’ve been working on the [South Asian Genotype Project](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/12/02/south-asian-genotype-project/). Again, if you are interested:**send me a 23andMe, Ancestry, or Family Tree DNA raw genotype file to contactgnxp-at- gmail.com.**

In the subject please put:

1.  “South Asian Genotype Project”
2.  The state/province your family is from
3.  Ethnolinguistic group
4.  If applicable, caste

I changed the reference populations because the earlier ones were too complicated. You can see the population averages from public data sets for some groups. The results for project members are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124F0p1foJpnSt2DJcmo_cgxhq1sht34WLErxU9TJuRw/edit?usp=sharing). I re-ran everyone who has sent data in so far. I’ll leave commentary for later.

At this point, I think the easiest way to update project members is to create a mailing list. If you are have submitted genotypes, please join:
