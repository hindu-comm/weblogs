[The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958332/geneexpressio-20) is probably my favorite book from Pinker.

Last week I started seeing scientists who I respect(ed) starting to tweet that Steven Pinker, a moderately liberal academic of Jewish background, is a fan of Neo-Nazis. This stuff started to litter my timeline since I follow many scientists on Twitter. To find all the links and commentary, start with [Jerry Coyne](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2018/01/12/pinkergate-the-last-word/), who is a friend of Steve’s. All I have to say is that a substantial portion of the science Twittersphere is OK with bracketing Steven Pinker with Neo-Nazis. True fact.

I read [Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DMCVXO0/geneexpressio-20) two years ago. I don’t remember much about that book though.

[CBC under fire for documentary that says first humans to colonize New World sailed from Europe](http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/cbc-under-fire-for-documentary-that-says-first-humans-to-colonize-new-world-sailed-from-europe). There is less evidence for the Solutrean Hypothesis now than there was 20 years ago (in a relative sense). We also now know from ancient DNA that almost no Solutrean ancestry is present in modern Europeans.

If you don’t believe me, read this paper, [The genetic history of Ice Age Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4943878/).

At least most of my Twitter followers don’t seem to be anti-Pinker.

Having a hard time saying anything about Anhui of note. Perhaps that says something?
