Neanderthals were human, say it loud and proud

Today was a similar event. [Neanderthals, the World’s First Misunderstood Artists](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/science/neanderthals-cave-paintings-europe.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news):

[Chris Stringer](https://twitter.com/ChrisStringer65/status/966758130725150721) thinks this is real too.

First, a shout out to my old friend [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/). He’s been slowly repairing the reputation of Neanderthals for many years, and now we’re almost there. Neanderthals had large brains. Their cranial capacities were the largest of all hominins. The idea that they were brutes without language, as Richard Klein hypothesizes in [Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471252522/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=A3HGQCnwdqMUl0jimv8sgg&slotNum=31), seems ludicrous now.

Back in the early 2000s I read Stephen Oppenheimer’s [The Real Eve](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786711922/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393067785&linkCode=w61&imprToken=A3HGQCnwdqMUl0jimv8sgg&slotNum=31), and one of the arguments that I thought was ludicrous at the time is that the dominance of African humans was not due to some distinct genetic advantage (as Richard Klein posited), but accumulated cultural capital which gradually but continuously compounded over time. Though one shouldn’t discount genes, especially in the context of gene-cultural coevolution, with hindsight it seems clear that a simple causal factor of genetic innovation driving advantages vis-a-vis Neanderthals may be too simplistic.

Papers such as [Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19310) illustrate that **first mover advantage can result in huge demographic consequences.** Small groups of farmers in the hillocks of the Fertile Crescent 10,000 years ago transitioned to agriculture just early enough that their genetic impact on West and South Eurasian populations, as well as African ones, would be enormous. Similarly, the invention of the light chariot by the Sintashta people may have resulted in the spread of haplogroup R1a-Z93.
