Reflecting on Journey of Man 15 years later

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the_journey_of_man.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the_journey_of_man.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2&utm_content=buffer5bd89&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)[Journey of Man](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2&utm_content=buffer5bd89&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer), Spencer Wells’ book and documentary, came out 15 years ago. To a great extent the impact of TV is such that one can argue it introduced genetic anthropology to a whole generation.

A lot has happened since then. On this week’s [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2&utm_content=buffer5bd89&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) we review what’s happened since then, and how Spencer, who started out a conventional academic scientist, became a documentarian.
