Perhaps the ‘Genghis Khan haplotype’ is not Genghis Khan’s?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/genghis_khan_mclynn.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/genghis_khan_mclynn.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00X2ZW5ZI/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=069111854X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=Y9xb5qWfa2LEdf-i5L9QDQ&slotNum=13)Literally hundred of thousands of people have read my post, [1 in 200 men direct descendants of Genghis Khan](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/1-in-200-men-direct-descendants-of-genghis-khan/#.WnZJEpM-eL8), since 2010. It was based on the paper [The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(07)60587-4)\*, which reported that one particular Y chromosomal lineage was very common in Central Asia, and, that it exhibited hallmarks of explosive growth over the last thousand years.

A new paper suggests that this inference is wrong, [Whole-sequence analysis indicates that the Y chromosome C2\*-Star Cluster traces back to ordinary Mongols, rather than Genghis Khan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-017-0012-3):

The primary aspect here seems to be pushing the age back. The Mongols, or what became the Mongols, were a marginal group of tribes when this variant arose. There is some citation of the fact that some putative descendants of Genghis Khan don’t even carry the “Star Cluster”, but there are other papers which report even different haplotypes! So I’m not sure that that is dispositive in any sense.

Perhaps the true question now is **why this cluster expanded so much over the past 2,500 years or so?** There are plenty of candidates historically, but being Bayesians we should be cautious about overturning prior hypotheses on new data. Coalescence dating in particular is often an art as opposed to a science (I don’t mean this literally, but anyone who has used the programs mentioned in the paper knows what I mean).

An alternative model is that as a null we should expect star clusters now and then. But most people don’t seem to think that rapid expansion of Y chromosomes during the Holocene is simply a matter of chance as opposed to necessity.
