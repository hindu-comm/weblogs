It’s nice that people are stumbling upon it now. Additionally, we’re pretty satisfied with the uptake. So far. To break out of our “core” audience we need more people to know about us.

First, please subscribe via [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight) or [Google Play](https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&apn=com.google.android.music&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I7jprtnf55fbp6z77d24zfcmika?t%3DThe_Insight%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16). Second, mention the podcast on social media. Tell your friends. Third, we have the next two or three podcasts planned, **we’re still taking suggestions for ideas and possible guests** (so far we’ve had John Hawks and Joe Pickrell on).

I now have Amazon Associates for Canada and the UK. The links to US Amazon items I post on this page should now change depending on your IP.

This is a pretty good article. But a few points. First, anyone who followed the literature would have predicted that Cheddar Man would contribute \~10% of the genomes to modern Britons and that he would lack alleles for light skin, but have them for blue eyes. I can’t believe any of the researchers were shocked in light of the La Brana etc. results. Second, we’re not extremely confident that he had very dark skin after the past few years when it’s clear pigmentation genetics involves more than just a few major loci. Seeing as how selection methods have detected lots of sweeps for skin lightening alleles over the last 5,000 years in Northern Europe, it seems implausible that they were as light as modern Northern Europeans, but not necessarily dark.

Spencer and I will probably an episode of [The Insight](insitome.libsyn.com/website) on Cheddar Man after the documentary is out on the 18th (and the paper, probably in *Nature*).

There are variations of opinion within Islam on this practice. It is mandatory, meritorious, or there is no comment. Muslims from areas where this is not practiced, such as South Asia or the Maghreb, naturally assume that this is a “cultural practice” that has nothing to do with Islam.

This is simply false. The Shafi school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence considers female circumcision obligatory, for example. The complicated issue is that a) not all women subject to female circumcision/FGM are Muslim, for instance, in Africa, including Egyptian Copts b) not all Muslims are subject to the practice, obviously. These facts allow all sorts of confusions and obfuscations to emerge.

But the bigger issue is that if you are not Muslim **it is not really coherent to say that something is a “cultural” practice as opposed to a “religious” one.** Religion is part of the culture, and to a great extent on the reflective conscious scale the defining element of culture. Muslims disagree as to the religious acceptability of many practices. Those disagreements are cultural because Islam is cultural.

It’s one whose premises rub me the wrong way: the vigorousmixing of state *fiat* with the market. I’m not a fan of “industrial policy.” And yet I read the book because Michael Lind, the author, knows his history, and he’s honest about it.

I do think on some level I’m rethinking my commitment to the free market as opposed to institutions, and the short-term benefits of market efficiency set against the long-term advantages of social stability. That’s probably part of a general trend toward conservatism away from libertarianism.

[Let’s Ban Porn](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/lets-ban-porn.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fross-douthat&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection). Don’t laugh. It took some boldness for*The New York Times* to publish something as laugh-out-loud implausible. But in the end, I think porn is the symptom. Really we as a culture don’t agree on what sex is supposed to be about. Without that agreement, porn is a sideshow.

Also, the proliferation of porn in the last 20 years hasn’t led to the explosion of sex crimes that critics on the Left and Right would have predicted.

What’s the deal? Well, I can tell you that we are building a nice brand, and periodically there are traffic spikes. And the [microscope](https://dnageeks.com/products/100x-led-powered-microscope-for-mobile-devices?&utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_02042018&utm_medium=cellphonemicroscope) is killing it.

The main sadness for me is that the ratio of [R1b](https://dnageeks.com/products/the-r1b-m222-haplotee?&utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_02122018&utm_medium=r1b) to [R1a](https://dnageeks.com/products/the-r1a-haplotee?&utm_source=gnxp_open_thread_02122018&utm_medium=r1b) t-shirts sold is like 20:1. But I guess it’s quality over quantity?

While I was taking a Twitter break I got a few DMs about the latest controversy about hours worked by academics:

> The stupidest thing on science twitter is how crazy and nasty people > get over the idea that you have to work hard in science to succeed. Everybody knows you have to work hard and long to succeed, and yet everyone is willing to outright lie about the truth, lest you be publicly destroyed.

It’s pretty clear some people work fewer hours than other people and do fine. It’s also clear that other people have higher sweet spots in terms of return-on-time-worked. The problem is when people presume there’s a one-size-fits-all formula. I think it would be best if people reacted with a little more charity to those who extrapolate from what’s worked for them.
