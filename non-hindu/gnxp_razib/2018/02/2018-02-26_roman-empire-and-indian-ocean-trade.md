Roman Empire and Indian Ocean Trade

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/roman_empire_indian_ocean.jpg?resize=155%2C224&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/roman_empire_indian_ocean.jpg?resize=155%2C224&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OZ3HWM2/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0198504403&linkCode=w61&imprToken=6VGrRM4ywOfliDJpxKnn4w&slotNum=49)I periodically check up on Amazon’s monthly deals. Though the science section is usually pretty thin, the history deals are more numerous. A lot of them are not too good, or are reprints of very old books. But now and then you get a scholarly and dense work which is magically priced at below \$2.00.

So I bought a copy of [The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: Rome’s Dealings with the Ancient Kingdoms of India, Africa and Arabia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OZ3HWM2/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0198504403&linkCode=w61&imprToken=6VGrRM4ywOfliDJpxKnn4w&slotNum=49), and skimming over it it’s definitely not the most scintillating prose, but there’s a lot of interesting material in the book. If you are looking for a good book, I would recommend it, especially at that price.
