Five things paleogenetics tells us about the human past

For years people have asked me about a book to read to understand what genetics has to say about human history. **This is that book.**

And yet before you get there, what do you need to know?

Here are **five things** you should know. Five things that we know with a very high degree of certitude.

1.  Many (most?) modern populations clusters we perceive as clear and
    distinct date to the last 5,000 years. To give a concrete example,
    the genetics that we find to be typical of Northern Europeans only
    comes into being \~5,000 years ago, with the [Corded
    Ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corded_Ware_culture#Origins)
    populations. To my knowledge none of the prior populations along the
    North European plain exhibit the mix of characteristics and
    ancestries typical of modern Northern Europeans in any way, shape,
    or form. 2.  Concomitantly, many of the physical characteristics we find typical
    of modern populations are probably relatively recent configurations
    due to natural selection. 3.  Non-African populations, whether European, Middle Eastern, South
    Asian, (South)East Asian, Amerindian or Oceanian, derive from a
    population expansion that dates to \~50,000 years BP. These
    populations experienced a bottleneck on the order of 1,000 to 10,000
    breeding individuals. 4.  Modern humans are old. Population structure within Africa of modern
    humans dates to at least 200,000 years before the present, and
    perhaps even earlier. 5.  Population turnover was ubiquitous. Change was the only constant.
