Rainforest hunter-gatherers are not primitive or primal

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/newhistoriesofandaman.jpg?resize=180%2C271&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/newhistoriesofandaman.jpg?resize=180%2C271&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1107434025/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0060932902&linkCode=w61&imprToken=I9s5jOZZ9rf8eeH97WoJNg&slotNum=43)Recently I had a discussion with a friend that I suspect the “tropical pygmy” phenotype you see Central Africa and Southeast Asia is a pretty recent development. So this sort of [assertion](http://allthatsinteresting.com/north-sentinel-island-tribe), “The Sentinelese tribe have remained on their North Sentinel Island, almost completely uncontacted for nearly 60,000 years…” is probably wrong. First, the Sentinelese probably arrived with other Andaman peoples during the Pleistocene from mainland Southeast Asia when the archipelago may have been connected to the mainland due to low sea levels.

Second, the small size of many tropical hunter-gatherer populations may simply be due to the difficulty of surviving in this environment. Though rainforests are lush, humans can’t access a lot of it, and small animals tend to require more energy to catch than is justified by how much meat they provide.

Genomics is now on the case: [Polygenic adaptation and convergent evolution across both growth and cardiac genetic pathways in African and Asian rainforest hunter-gatherers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/04/13/300574.full.pdf):

> Different human populations facing similar environmental challenges > have sometimes evolved convergent biological adaptations, for example > hypoxia resistance at high altitudes and depigmented skin in northern > latitudes on separate continents. The pygmy phenotype (small adult > body size), a characteristic of hunter-gatherer populations inhabiting > both African and Asian tropical rainforests, is often highlighted as > another case of convergent adaptation in humans.

A minor note: there is some ethnographic data that the isolated Sentinelese are not as small as the other Andaman Islanders. Some of their small size may simply be due to exposure to diseases and the stress of settlers from the mainland.
