To be honest I’m a little relieved that there wasn’t that much focus on the “perversions” of heredity. Lots of interesting stuff. This is definitely a book that scientists and lay people could benefit from.

Carl is a great writer so he makes rather abstruse concepts clear and engaging to nonspecialists. As for those of us who have our noses close to the ground, we sometimes lose the bigger perspective. There is a lot of interesting research that he surfaces in [She Has Her Mother’s Laugh](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101984597/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192807285&linkCode=w61&imprToken=TL3bao6gbZo6XseNFEBs1Q&slotNum=32) that I wasn’t very familiar with, though I had probably read about it or seen it in one of his columns (or Ed Yong’s).

Met a lot of cool people, and touched base with others who I knew ahead of time, at the [AAPA](http://physanth.org/annual-meetings/annual-meeting-2018/) 2018. Compared to ASHG or even SMBE the conference was very white. I guess that’s why there were all the diversity sessions?

I had a lot of discussions with Lee Berger about science on a broad philosophical level. Unfortunately, specialization is such that it can be hard to communicate across disciplines such as human genomics and paleoanthropology. But as Lee brings enough samples into the open to do some real statistics I think that will change how constrained to the elect paleoanthropological knowledge is.

Lee’s son introduced me to the concept of South African barbecue. I haven’t had any yet, but I’m curious about it.

Lee will be on this week’s episode of [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/website). Again, please subscribe on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I7jprtnf55fbp6z77d24zfcmika). The last episode with Stuart Ritchie was our most successful yet in terms of traffic. We’re suspecting that Lee’s episode will do quite well as well. People keep finding the podcast by chance. We really need reviews to get featured by iTunes!

Spencer and I will probably shift back to a two-person conversation next week. We should probably do an AMA again soon.

But my issue is straightforward: humans have scrambled biogeography so much in such a short amount of time. I think any other industrial species would have done the same. Even after they went extinct, the phylogeographic chaos they wrought would remain.

It seems very likely that **all** Australian marsupials descend from one South American ancestor species. The explosive emergence of very different placentals all across Australia simultaneously in the fossil record would be quite suspicious (or red deer descendants in New Zealand).

I also talked to a few friends about what they thought about David’s op-ed and book. It’s no surprise that there are legitimate human population geneticists considering writing a response of some sort. It’s also no surprise that even critics of David within the population genetics community think that the [Buzzfeed op-ed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich) was so bad that it makes it harder for them say something, as the water has been nuddied.

In some ways the reaction has made one of David’s major points: population geneticists need to offer their unvarnished opinions, rather than cosigning people in other fields who mangle their findings.

Some people feel that David “threw me under the bus” in his now infamous chapter. I don’t see it that way.

As many of you know (if you subscribe to [my total content feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed) you know) I have a few other blogs, one of them [Brown Pundits](http://www.brownpundits.com/). It actually receives substantial traffic from India now. It will be “interesting” to say the least.

[A population genetic interpretation of GWAS findings for human quantitative traits](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985). Stuck in the weeds of ancient DNA these past few years I haven’t been paying attention to the storm of GWAS and PRS approaching.
