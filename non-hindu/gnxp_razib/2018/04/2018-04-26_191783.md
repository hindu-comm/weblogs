The effective population size of Australian people is just too large for me to imagine that it was only a few individuals swept out on driftwood. **There was some sort of sea-going craft which mediated migration to Sahul from Sundaland.**Just because we have only recent evidence of sea-going craft doesn’t mean that they weren’t around for tens of thousands of years before that.

It seems that people are finally convinced that this is the real deal, as the stratigraphy came together to confirm dates. One thing that seems obvious from this, as well as Neanderthal “art”, **is that the differences between modern humans and Neanderthals were more quantitative than qualitative.** Differences of degree, not of kind.

It is hard to deny that modern human expansion between 60 and 15 thousand years ago is *sui generis*. Hominins didn’t make it to the New World or Sahul, what later became Oceania, until our own kind. There’s also a fair amount of evidence that our lineage pushed the northern frontier of human habitation beyond what Neanderthals ever did. But in the process of marking off our distinctiveness, it seems to me that **we’ve overemphasized the differences between us and Neanderthals, and dismissed or ignored evidence of “human-like” “advanced” behaviors from them.**

I’ll still go with the prediction that we’ll never find a singular gene which marks us off from other human lineages.
