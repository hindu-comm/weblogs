Personal genomics lives!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C197&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exploring_personal_genomics-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C197&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199644497/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=gnvR4PWn9IO6hKHOB5-6bA&slotNum=38)Reflecting back to it I think I started “exploring personal genomics” in the late 2000s. That’s when direct-to-consumer testing started to become popular, albeit very niche. The book [Exploring Personal Genomics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199644497/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=gnvR4PWn9IO6hKHOB5-6bA&slotNum=38) is now 5 years old, and a lot has changed since then. In the same year, 2013, David Mittelman and I cowrote [Rumors of the death of consumer genomics are greatly exaggerated](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb4141) in *Genome Biology*.

Now *Science* has a commentary out, [Crowdsourced genealogies and genomes](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aat2634), which reviews how large amounts of public data, genetic and classical genealogical, are being used to change the field before our very eyes. **I would recommend though that you read the less edited (longer, more detailed) version on the website of the author**s, [Crowdsourcing big data research on human history and health: from genealogies to genomes and back again](https://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/content/crowdsourcing-big-data-research-human-history-and-health-genealogies-genomes-and-back-again).

This fact from that piece is really illustrative of what’s happening today:

> As the number of customers of whole-genome DTC genetic testing just > crossed 16 million, **it is worth noting that almost two-thirds of > them joined since the beginning of 2017** \[19\]. Based on current > rates, this number of customers is predicted to be close to 100 > million by end of 2020.
