It’s what you’d expect from a Carl Zimmer book, threading history with rock-solid attention to science. So far he’s actually been a really good, if popular, history of science. I say popular not pejoratively, but because the thematic and chronological structure isn’t academic, but hinges on more personal stories, whether it Carl’s own family, or people, famous and not so famous, with genetic issues that passed on down through the generations.

The book isn’t out yet, but you can pre-order of course. The current plan is to get Carl on [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) ([Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I7jprtnf55fbp6z77d24zfcmika) and [web](http://insitome.libsyn.com/website)).

Because I’ve been pestering you, some of you have left nice feedback for us, which is pretty important over the long-term. I’ll probably keep on this until we reach 100 reviews on iTunes.

Last week’s episode on the topic Jewish genetics is the biggest one so far in terms of single-week downloads, and this week’s conversation with [Stuart Ritchie](https://twitter.com/StuartJRitchie) should also pull in some interest. We talk a fair amount about Stuart’s book, [Intelligence: All That Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1444791877/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393329887&linkCode=w61&imprToken=juSef0BGtkcd-HM4mKHIyQ&slotNum=26), and depressing topics such as the decline in fluid intelligence over a lifetime.

We’ll probably be revisiting intelligence and genetics with a future guest soon, but in the short-term we’ll pivot toward paleoanthropology since the [AAPA](http://physanth.org/annual-meetings/annual-meeting-2018/) is going on this week. I don’t know anything about bones so I’m going to mostly check out the pop-gen sessions, and then ask [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/) for a core-dump at some point near the end of the week for the rest.

But I got one for myself (we don’t comp ourselves, so I paid for it fair and square!).

Many rely on Twitter and Google Scholar, but I want to remind people of [Pubchase](https://www.pubchase.com/explore/personal) and [SciReader](http://scireader.org/). They’re still useful to finding things right outside of your core zone of interest.

I was reading it before switching to Carl’s book (I want to prep for a podcast and I’m also going to give the book to someone else), and it’s OK, but it has the same problem as [Inventing the Individual](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674979885/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393329887&linkCode=w61&imprToken=KmNj6dygVnPXurzkAnco3Q&slotNum=26): intellectual history which engages in a sequence of inferences and asserts their validity by fiat without any argument.

There’s a lot to learn from books like this, but that mostly involves facts, rather than arguments (whose premises and method I generally find unpersuasive).

On that recommendation, I got[The Fate of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691166838/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=Bu1aBzZ.XlvydxrbV8Lchg&slotNum=26), as[The Fall of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192807285&linkCode=w61&imprToken=6xmVPvrMScT1bIhjwnANeA&slotNum=26)is arguably my favorite history book of all time.

We’ll see.

[Ezra Klein and Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/podcasts/123-identity-honesty/) had a podcast debate. I didn’t learn much new in this debate aside from how the two view each other (lots of commentary on the comments of the other).

But one thing I have to say is that Sam Harris’ contention that America’s racial caste system was not historically **rooted** in a biological conception of racial hierarchy is a point I agree with. By the late 19th and early 20th century, the public rhetoric was **based** on such an understanding, but that understanding developed organically over time with the emergence of taxonomy and then evolutionary biology in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Though Daniel Walker Howe’s magisterial [What Hath God Wrought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195078942/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0195078942&linkCode=w61&imprToken=Vl50UWst4x2.Awog7FukMA&slotNum=234) is not about race fundamentally, it is a useful work to try and get a sense of how our modern conceptions of the white supremacist republic may mislead us in terms of how it was initially conceived (as on many things, white nationalists and people on the extreme cultural Left agree on many things about early America, where I think they are being anachronistic).

I think most readers now get a sense I am rather pessimistic about concepts such as public reason and getting the populace on board with ideas through persuasion. But, self-styled intellectual elites should still try to cultivate less stupidity and ignorance than is the case today. We’re led too often in the public arena by fools who can’t do their own data analysis, haven’t read the history books they were assigned in college, and whose goal is to seem smart enough to trick the masses than actually impress themselves with what they’ve achieved. Though I guess for most people impressing oneself is about the bank account.

The Rakhigarhi publication is supposed to be here within a month or so. But that’s what I was told a month or so ago. At this point I don’t expect to be surprised. We need to think about archaeology, linguistics, and mythology.

For your amusement:

[Genetic influence on social outcomes during and after the Soviet era in Estonia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0332-5). Heritability increases with meritocracy. That’s what you’d expect.

[Slope or correlation, not variance explained, allow estimation of heritability](http://www.cureffi.org/2013/04/30/slope-or-correlation-not-variance-explained-allow-estimation-of-heritability/).

[Viktor Orban: Hungary PM re-elected for third term](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43693663). 70% of the vote went to right-wing nationalist parties. Europe’s mainstream elite shouldn’t blame the people, they’re the ones who are promoting the worship of democracy as the only legitimate form of government. They need to blame themselves.

[Comparison of phasing strategies for whole human genomes](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007308). Not a big surprise if you’ve tried this, but if you haven’t, a must read.

It looks like modal extra-pair paternity rates in human populations are in the range of [1-2%](https://twitter.com/lisadebruine/status/981904887511486466). Sorry aspiring cuckolds!
