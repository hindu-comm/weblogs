Judith Rich Harris, 1938-2018

> Sad to learn of the death of a major influence and dear friend, the brilliant and witty psychologist Judith Rich Harris. Too early for an obit, but the NYT review of her magnum opus may be found here: <https://t.co/nrqZyHJqMc> >

A reread is bittersweet, knowing what has come to pass. But one of the best things about[The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0670031518&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JAwKg0.qSCvArg.vB6wNUA&slotNum=158)is that he gave extensive publicity to Judith Rich Harris’ [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0684857073&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JAwKg0.qSCvArg.vB6wNUA&slotNum=189). I like to think, perhaps hope, that her work influenced many “Generation X” parents.

  
In January of 2006, she answered [10 Questions](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-judith-rich-harris.php) for this weblog. Judy and her husband were always gracious and kind in their email correspondence with me. I can’t say that for many academics who are in the fullness of their health and well-being, something she struggled with for decades.

Her life made a difference. Read[The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0684857073&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JAwKg0.qSCvArg.vB6wNUA&slotNum=189) and her follow-up book,[No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393059480/ref=ase_geneexpressio-20/104-4703056-1415937?s=books&v=glance&n=283155&tagActionCode=geneexpressio-20), to understand why.
