A pagan psychology does not a pagan society make

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/inGodsWeTrust.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/inGodsWeTrust.jpeg?resize=181%2C279&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0195149300&linkCode=w61&imprToken=rji8sv2CD1zc4Tl3VlqU5Q&slotNum=124)Ross Douthat has a column in *The New York Times*, [The Return of Paganism: Maybe there actually is a genuinely post-Christian future for America](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/opinion/christianity-paganism-america.html). He concludes:

> That embarrassment may not last forever; perhaps a prophet of a new > harmonized paganism is waiting in the wings. Until then, those of us > who still believe in a divine that made the universe rather than just > pervading it — and who have a certain fear of what more immanent spirits have to offer us — should be able to recognize the outlines of a possible successor to our world-picture, while taking comfort that it is not yet fully formed.

Thirteen years ago I also stumbled in such an inchoate direction in a post, [A Prayer For The Emperor](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2005/10/06/a-prayer-for-the-emperor/). Douthat in fact linked to this post from his perch at [The American Scene](http://theamericanscene.com/), though he may not recall it.

I think Douthat is making a distinction implicitly in*The New York Times* column between a pagan psychology, which bubbles up out of human innate cognitive architecture, and a pagan religious society, which takesthe cognitive froth and reshapes it into collective ritual and belief.

We imbue places and animals with spirit. In general, I agree with the scholars who argue that this is an outcome of “overactive agency detection.” **A world filled with the illusion of life and danger may induce more stress and anxiety, but in the Darwinian context, excessive vigilance is a virtue, not a vice**.

“Religion nerds” like Douthat and Rod Dreher actually have a fair amount in common in their assumptions and cognitive style with hyper-rational atheists such as [Armin Navabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Navabi)(Navabi comes out of a “religion nerd” background). As Roman Catholic Christians Douthat and Dreher must give a nod to the mystical, and Dreher, in particular, has asserted the importance of the sensory in reawakening his religious faith. But both scaffold, channel and discipline their supernatural intuitions into very precise streams. Similarly, Navabi’s understanding of religion is as a**system***.*

One of the elements of the religious systems developed over the past 3,000 years in complex societies characterized by specialization, and the emergence of a literate ruling class (or at least a ruling class which makes recourse to a literate caste), is that animistic and spirit-soaked component of religion has receded. Some intellectual historians have argued that the atheism of early modern Europe can be understood as the logical conclusion of a rationalist streak within Reformed Protestantism, which reduced the supernatural singularly to God and his host. Whereas other forms of Christianity perceived the world as filled with false gods who were faces of genuine demons, the rationalist form of Reformed Protestantism dismissed false gods as human inventions. This diminution of the supernatural then might lead one to the next logical step, banishing even God from the universe!

I do not think this was a special event in world history. We are all aware that the same tendency was pregnant within Hinduism, Buddhism, and in Chinese societies, with certain sects and factions pushing toward atheism and materialism. In the world of early Islam [skeptics also existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%CA%BFarri), often drawing from the older traditions of the Classical World. Strangely, it is in the European Christian world that the supernatural-skeptical tradition was mostly absent. One might suppose this might have something to do with near monopoly of the religious class on intellectual activity in Western Europe for many centuries. Those who were personally skeptical likely kept that to themselves due to their vocation.

The existence of religious reform and revival, and zealous cults, within most societies is due in large part to the deviationism that characterizes the religious sentiments of the populace at large. Though the mythos, ritual, and panoply of the great religions attract the people to them, **the reality is that all these could exist without the formal and rationalist element which is necessitated by the systematizing tendencies of the intelligentsia**.

What we see in the decline of the customary Christian sects and denominations in American society is in some ways a loss of the power of cultural elites. Arguably this period of the dominance of several forms of Christianity was itself a temporary period, with the early republic characterized by a large proportion of unchurched and free-thinkers, as well as a plethora of radical sects. The decades after World War II were an exception, which we took to be the new normal.

The broader decline in trust in institutions, the popularization of culture, and the disdain toward elites, has manifested now a turning away from organized religion. But the populace still wants to believe, and in their hearts they have deep and strong intuitions about the universe. Whether the universe has purpose, it*feels*like it has purpose. Individuals and subcultures develop*ad hoc* beliefs and practices to channel these feelings and sentiments, but there is no broad social system or identity to bind them together into a formal whole.

A “harmonized paganism”, as Douthat may say, may not manifest because a it needs a harmonious society, and that is not something we have. State paganism needs a powerful state with a self-confident elite culture. State paganism needs an Emperor, to be the [axis mundi](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Axis_Mundi) between Heaven and Earth. Elite Western Christianity is collapsing, but it being replaced popular paganism, and that is because elite high culture no longer has the prestige it once did, and all is demotic. The ancient world was not a mass society, it was a culture defined by rules, and bound by ritual. The consumer society is driven bottom-up decision making, the impulse of the mob.

What we are seeing is the reemergence of hunter-gatherer animism writ large.
