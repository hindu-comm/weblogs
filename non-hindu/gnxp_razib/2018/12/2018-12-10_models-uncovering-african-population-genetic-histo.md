Models uncovering African population genetic history

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/multaf.jpg?resize=625%2C516&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/multaf.jpg?resize=625%2C516&ssl=1)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/07/489401.full.pdf)  
In a deep sense, we know a lot more about the population genetic history of England at the fine-grain than we do about the whole continent of Africa. That’s going to change in the near future, **as researchers now realize that the history and emergence of modern humans within the continent was a more complex, and perhaps more multi-regional, affair than had been understood.**

Because of the relative dearth of ancient DNA, there has been a lot of deeply analytic work that draws from some pretty abstruse mathematical tools operating on extant empirical data. A series of preprints have come out which use different methods, and arrive at different particular details of results, but ultimately seem to be illuminating a reoccurring set of patterns. Dimly perceived, but sensed nonetheless.

Here’s the latest offering, [Models of archaic admixture and recent history from two-locus statistics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/07/489401.full.pdf). I can’t pretend to have read the whole preprint (lots of math), but these empirical results jumped out at me:

To be frank I’m not sure as to the utility of the term “archaic” anymore. **I sometimes wish that we’d rename “modern human” to “modal human.”** That is, the dominant lineage that was around \~200,000 years ago in relation to modern population ancestry.

But, these results are aligned with other work from different research groups which indicate that something basal to all other modern humans, but within a clade of modern humans in relation to Neanderthal-Denisovans, admixed with a modern human lineage expanding out of eastern Africa. The LWK sample is Bantu, and has a minority Nilotic component that has West Eurasian ancestry. This probably accounts for the dilution of the basal lineage from 7.5% to 6%.

I wouldn’t be surprised if the final proportions differ. And other research groups have found deep lineages with African hunter-gatherers. My own view is that it does seem likely that one of the African human populations that flourished \~200, 000 years ago expanded and assimilated many of the other lineages. The “Out of Africa” stream is one branch of this ancient population. But it seems possible that the expansion was incomplete, and that other human lineages persisted elsewhere until a relatively late date.
