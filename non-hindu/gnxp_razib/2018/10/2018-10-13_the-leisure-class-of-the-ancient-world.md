The leisure class of the ancient world

But that’s a little short-sighted view, even though arguably correct in some sense.

Books such as [The Fate of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071SLPWVL/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=l7PiCnklVjxUWOf3q5W8aA&slotNum=32&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) and [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006OYD2K6/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=l7PiCnklVjxUWOf3q5W8aA&slotNum=32&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) make it quite clear that Classical Antiquity achieved some level of globalization in its corner of Eurasia. At the other end of Eurasia, the [Grand Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China)) also illustrates the importance of trade and economic interdependence in complex pre-modern societies.

But what has been made can be unmade. One of the major arguments in [Framing the Early Middle Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006SF3M5G/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=l7PiCnklVjxUWOf3q5W8aA&slotNum=32&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is that the decline in the social complexity of the early medieval period in Europe was due in part to the collapse of the whole fiscal apparatus of the Roman bureaucratic state. Some of these weak post-Roman states were really chiefdoms bound together with personalized rule. A process which advanced the furthest in Britain and the Balkans.

And yet during the first grat maximum of human civilization in the years after 0 international trade extended even beyond the bounds of specific imperium, from one end of Eurasia to the other.

Much of it is concerned **with the role of conspicuous consumption among elites in the Roman Empire in driving this trade, and so the bullion drain to the east.** Silk, incense, ivory, and medicines were all imported in large quantities from the east. The state benefited in some sense through taxation, but the drain on specie was a constant consideration. It is well known that Roman coinage, sometimes modified, became the standard in the southern half of India in the first centuries AD.

In a stepwise fashion, East Roman traders pushed across the Indian ocean until in 166 we know that [they reached the imperial court in China](https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/First-Roman-Embassy.pdf). This connection seems to have been made by following the trade routes which were already established by Indians into Southeast Asia. Roman geographers were familiar with the general shape of Peninsular Malaysia, as well as Java.

**Because our records from China and the Roman Empire are very good, is easy to ignore the reality that a whole network of cities existed along the shores of the Indian ocean.** These cities grew up around trade and acted as intermediaries for the demand for particular luxury goods which also pumped specie out of Roman mines. But the decades after the Antonine plague seems to have been defined by multiple regressions across Eurasia, as societies dependent and expecting trade faltered when local nodes collapsed and interrupted the flow.
