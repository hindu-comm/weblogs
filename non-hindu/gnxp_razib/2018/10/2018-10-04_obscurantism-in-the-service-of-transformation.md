The paper, [Ancient Admixture in Human History](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3522152/), was peculiar as far as genetics publications go in that it foregrounds particular abstruse statistical methods developed due to the stimulus of genome-wide variation data. The surfeit of genomic data has resulted in the emergence of many subtle and almost impenetrable works laced with formalisms which daunt most biologists. But given time and effort, these newer methods relying upon greater analytic sophistication ***are*** decipherable.

To illustrate what I’m talking about, consider [Mathematical Models of Social Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226558274/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=r2sgP6kKjJuVtYapp6rNuA&slotNum=1&imprToken=4dhY2BKRYmnDFu4yDuycnA&slotNum=29&imprToken=ahuvbQ2-xOlEwcHGO6hfjQ&slotNum=33&imprToken=px28GziPlQ1emNxuhYgX2g&slotNum=44&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). This is a book with a fair amount of formality, but the topic, culture, social change, are often considerations which we ruminate upon verbally.

I open up to page 238 (I literally opened a random page).

But most of the people reading this are probably not intimidatedby mathematical formalism. Many of you will know what intrademic and interdemic selection are. Some of you who are more numerically oriented may test some values to develop an intuition. The point is that the formalism is not there to intimidate. It is meant to illuminate. It is there so individuals thinking on the same problem can have a crisp currency with which they can exchange ideas.

Another major reason that this sort of formalism exists is that it’s clear when you think someone is wrong. A problem with many verbal arguments is that they are unspecified or vague in such a way that you’re not even sure if you disagree or agree with your interlocutor.**The point is to get somewhere.** Coherency. Contingency. Andcumulativeness.

Applying a mathematical theory derived from evolutionary biology to cultural and social change strikes many people as strange. But there’s a method to this madness. Theory with data can give birth to a better understanding of the processes which define our world. A description of reality.

In contrast, let me [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/838704-what-you-re-referring-to-is-what-s-called-theory-and-when) Noam Chomsky:

> “What you’re referring to is what’s called “theory.” And when I said > I’m not interested in theory, what I meant is, I’m not interested in > posturing–using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have > a theory when you have no theory whatsoever. So there’s no theory in > any of this stuff, not in the sense of theory that anyone is familiar > with in the sciences or any other serious field.

I can’t.** So I’m not interested in that kind of > **posturing**. Žižek is an extreme example of it. I don’t see anything > to what he’s saying. Jacques Lacan I actually knew. I kind of liked > him.

From the bottom of page 91:

> Therefore, there is a soliloquy of reason and a solitude of light. > Incapable of respecting the Being and meaning of the other, > phenomenology and ontology would be philosophies of violence. Through > them, the entire philosophical tradition, in its meaning and at > bottom, would make common cause with oppression and with the > totalitarianism of the same. The ancient clandestine friendship > between light and power, the ancient complicity between theoretically > objective and technico-political possession….

Obviously, I can’t read French. But if I was reading a scientific textbook a translation wouldn’t matter. To be entirely frank when I read these sorts of works in the deconstructionisttradition I feel like I’m reading mantras, not analyses. Declarations of gurus and rabbis. Great ones to emulate.

These authors often like to “play” with language, and engage in a semantic game and lead you on a verbal wild goose chase. Some of them are also better with a turn of phrase and able to generate luxurious prose which pulls you along in an almost novelistic fashion. **But reading a second time, often I have no more idea what’s really being said thanI did on the first inspection.**

Twenty years ago this was an academic discussion. I had long believed that some of my friends’ fixations with linguistic analysis and redefinition as thesummum bonum of any intellectual were silly and useless, but I didn’t think they’d have a direct impact. No longer. **This stuff matters.** My friends are now tenured professors.

From Judith Butler’s 1988’s [Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), in *Theater Journal*:

> When Beauvoir claims that ‘woman’ is a historical idea and not a > natural fact, she clearly underscores **the distinction between sex, > as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation** > or signification of that facticity. To be female is, according to that > distinction, a facticity which has no meaning, but to be a woman is to > have become a woman, to compel the body to conform to an historical > idea of ‘woman,’ to induce the body to become a cultural sign, to > materialize oneself in obedience to an historically delimited > possibility, and to do this as a sustained and repeated corporeal > project….

Whether you agree with it or not is beside the point. This stuff is not just academic.

**Addendum:** I really like to *know* things. I don’t read much fiction. That’s why some of the “scholarship” in tradition personified by Derrida, Butler, and yes, even Michel Foucault, infuriate me. They are the enemies of knowledge, but the potentates of pronouncement.
