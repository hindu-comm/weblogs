The plot to the right, which shows a smoothed chart of the total number of kits over time, is also important.

I recorded a podcast for the [Urbane Cowboys](https://soundcloud.com/urbanecowboys) last week. It should go up today, so watch for it. I talked about a variety of topics, so I don’t know how it will drop in regards to editing.

He asked about books, and [Descartes’ Error](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AFY2XVK/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=t4Yh7WYa6QyV6PiyE6IX-A&slotNum=0&imprToken=NJaOD2bmoYqi5NcBEEMpXw&slotNum=5&imprToken=LBqcwqdL.mYZVAWbwTU2bg&slotNum=0&imprToken=v.UjElxtJFeoXQWEjr8wTQ&slotNum=32&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) came to mind. But I’ve read about critiques of its interpretation of the history of science and philosophy, though I think the big picture conclusion is probably still valid.

Will be at ASHG this week. Mostly I’m going to learn more about African genomics. Not as much on pop-gen as in previous years. If I approach your poster, don’t worry that I’m going to tweet or write about. Just be cool.

Because of the World Wars, I think we learn a lot less about Prussia from 1700 on than we otherwise would. Blanning’s [The Pursuit of Glory: The Five Revolutions that Made Modern Europe: 1648-1815](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WW0LFA/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=VhBkVTzLtnH7HXSaaRalVg&slotNum=35&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is also excellent.

I’m listening to John Keegan’s [A History of Warfare](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AWGX5O/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=VhBkVTzLtnH7HXSaaRalVg&slotNum=35&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) on Audible. To be honest I think I’m much better at *reading* than *listening*. This shouldn’t be surprising. In courses, I generally prefer to learn from the textbook as opposed to listening to lectures. And I have a lot of experience reading over my lifetime. Less so listening.

I’ve gone back and reread passages several times. It is definitely on thediscursive side. That being said, I have come to a strange observation: Xunzi’s view of religion is similar to [Ludwig Wittgenstein’s](https://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/#H3). Here from the Stanford Encylopedia of Religion:

> He opposed interpretations of religion that emphasize doctrine or > philosophical arguments intended to prove God’s existence, but was > greatly drawn to religious rituals and symbols, and considered > becoming a priest. **He likened the ritual of religion to a great > gesture**, as when one kisses a photograph. This is not based on the > false belief that the person in the photograph will feel the kiss or > return it, nor is it based on any other belief. Neither is the kiss > just a substitute for a particular phrase, like “I love you.” Like the kiss, religious activity does express an attitude, but it is not just the expression of an attitude in the sense that several other forms of expression might do just as well….

This seems similar to Xunzi’s belief that religious rituals were an important part of life, even if supernatural beings did not exist. Though Wittgenstein seems to have had some sort of fundamental mystical religious beliefs, whereas Xunzi was more of a naturalist.
