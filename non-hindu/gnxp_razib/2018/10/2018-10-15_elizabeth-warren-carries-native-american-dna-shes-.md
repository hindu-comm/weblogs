Elizabeth Warren carries Native American DNA – she’s running!

The proportion of ancestry is not large. But it is clearly there. They compared to the Utah white and British European 1000 Genomes populations, which is a good standard for Old Stock Anglo-Americans. She’s clearly an outlier, with about an order of magnitude more “Native American” ancestry. So it’s unlikely to be some artifact.

There is some talk in the article about lack of reference populations. But remember, the key is to identify Native American ancestry, so all of this should coalesce back 10-15,000 years ago. Compared to the divergence from Northern Europeans, this is going to jump out against the genetic background.

So does Elizabeth Warren have Native American ancestry? 99% sure that that is a yes. Is she going to run? Well, I wouldn’t say 99%, but that seems likely too….

(I doubt she’ll do it, but it would be neat if she released her raw results)

**Update:** Here’s the [technical report](https://mk0elizabethwarh5ore.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bustamante_Report_2018.pdf).

**Update II:** Some quick responses to comments. I’m going to address the genetic aspects. I’ll leave the cultural and political angles to others.

- The analyst, who I know personally as well as by reputation, did
  exactly what I’d have expected he dowith this data. So nothing
  atypical in terms of method/analytic pipeline. You can download and
  use the tools yourself! - The number of markers used in the analysis, 660,000, is a good number.
  Sufficient most definitely for the local ancestry analysis done here
  (and probably on some level necessary to gain a high level of
  confidence). - Some people wonder about the sample size of the reference population.
  Is the number sufficient? Yes, for the purposes of this analysis. For
  the scope of the questions asked. You aren’t looking for recent
  relatives, you are looking for a good representation of the
  genealogical networks from a given geography/ethnicity. The Utah
  whites are an industry standard sample set that is well known. The
  British data set in the 1000 Genomes is also pretty well known. Both
  seem representative of people of Northwest European heritage, a set of
  populationswhich are genetically very similar to each other. - People are asking about the robustness of this result. One thing you
  have to remember when comparing reference sets against an individual
  is that the genetic distance of the reference sets is important.
  Applying local ancestry to an individual of Dutch ancestry with
  training sets of Germans and English heritage is going to produce
  results, but the training sets themselves are going to overlap in some
  ways. Now, if you take someone with Dutch ancestry and do local
  ancestry for English vs. Javanese ancestry, then you’re going to get
  really clear results in comparison. - Some serious individuals are questioning the representativeness of the
  European panel and the Native American panel. As well as the lack of
  Siberian groups, who are closely related. But we know that Warren’s
  family background is such that a shift toward a Northeast Asian group
  is likely to be Native American. Not Chukchi. Further analysis could
  confirm, **but the most likely hypothesis is that this is a woman of
  Northwest European ancestry with some Native American ancestry**.
  Other models could fit these results. But those are not likely models
  in the first place (also, the PCA on Native American groups makes it
  likely that she is not Siberian, and she is not shifted to the
  northern groups). - A huge issue is that people are worried about the representativeness
  of the Native American groups. First, if you are looking for someone
  with indigenous North American ancestry, **Mexican groups are
  sufficient**. If anything this will reduce your power to detect, not
  produce false positives. Second, look at the plot, Warren’s haplotype
  is positioned between Canadian and Mexican
  natives:![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-15-12.47.43.jpg?resize=600%2C345&ssl=1)
  ![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-15-12.47.43.jpg?resize=600%2C345&ssl=1) - People are interpreting this local ancestry method, which assigns
  segments of the genome to particular populations **with a
  probability**, to the point estimates provided in most consumer
  genomics results. From what I can see, they assigned 0.4% of Warren’s
  genome as Native American. But 8% was not assigned. This is almost
  certainly mostly European, but some of it may be Native as well.
  Basically, the method here was less about assigning a specific
  proportion, and more about testing whether it was likely she had
  detectable indigenous American ancestry (she did), and, the range of
  periods in which that ancestry could have admixed into the Northern
  European genetic background. **This is not comparable to the estimates
  you are getting from personal genomics tests**. - One way you can try to assess whether these are artifactual is to
  compare an individual to populations of known ancestry and see the
  distribution of empirical results. Warren’s results are very atypical
  in comparison to Northern European reference sets. If this is a “false
  positive” due to the training sets, then you would expect the same
  type of problem to crop up when test out sample individuals. - Some are asking whether Warren is just a typical white American. You
  would need to do apples-to-apples comparisons. But my intuition is
  that she’s not. Most Old Stock white Americans probably have a
  genealogical relationship to Native Americans, but they may not have
  any segments of DNA because it is too far back. Warren is part of the
  minority of white Americans who have detectable Native American
  ancestry.

Basically, I think it is very likely that Warren has Native American ancestry. Follow-up analysis would probably just increase our confidence.
