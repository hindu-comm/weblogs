The state origins of “modern humans” in 2018 (it’s a flux)

First, **the clines vs. clusters considerations seem to be one we need to revisit.** Like the expansion of Native American peoples \~15,000 years ago, it seems that the “Out of Africa” migration pulse happened so quickly that a lot of different groups emerged at the same time. In the new paper the earliest proto-“Ancient North Eurasians” can be modeled as most similar to the West Eurasian branch of humanity (*sans* Basal Eurasian), but with some minor component affinity to East Eurasians. It *could* be that this is a function of admixture between the distinct lineages. Or, it could be that there was a fair amount of substructure within the post-Basal Eurasian “Out of Africa” meta-population.

I’d need to know more ethnography than I do, but it seems not impossible for \~10,000 humans to be highly structured in Paleolithic social contexts, even if they were close geographically. But, this would entail a great deal of xenophobia and likely inter-group conflict.

Second, **I am convinced that there were earlier “Out of Africa” migrations.** Many of them. As John Hawks pointed out at ASHG the Neanderthals and Denisovans seem to be descended from a migration of African hominins that dates to somewhere after 1 million years ago. This means they replaced hominins that were present in Eurasia for [\~1 million years already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmanisi). Geneticists and paleontologists have both also discovered suggestive clues to likely “proto-modern” human populations that were present and admixing before the rapid expansion of Eurasians and Australasians \~40-50,000 years ago. With more ancient DNA and subtle analysis, I think we’ll find that modern human absorbed some layers between that of Denisovans and Neanderthals and the most recent expansion.

Finally, **I think multi-regionalism within Africa is between plausible and likely, and that major back-to-Africa migrations that modify/challenge “Out of Africa” are possible.** We are learning a lot. But that means simple elegant models are falling by the wayside.
