Our Edo period future?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/makingofmodernjapan.jpeg?resize=186%2C270&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/makingofmodernjapan.jpeg?resize=186%2C270&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B5OJLZ0/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77)The second season of [Westworld](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07C5QV7F6/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77) has some scenes set in Edo period Japan. To spoil things for you there is apparently a scene-by-scene re-creation of a plot arc from the first season of the show set in the American West. Watching this scene, and comparing it to the earlier version, **I can’t but help feel that the Edo period setting is more grand and refined.** If the first season’s violent attack was brutalist, the scene above is more neoclassical.

Then again, **Edo Japan and the American West are perhaps antipodes of second-millennium civilization.** Where the 19th century American West was anarchic,chaotic, and creative, the [Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period) in Japan was notable for its stability, order, and the perception that it was a culture in chrysalis. Old forms may have been reinvented, but those forms were treasured.

Not always in a good way. The islands were riven by internal warfare. The Japanese were known to be a piratical race by the Ming dynasty, and the 16th century ended with the warlord Hideyoshi’s disastrous [invasion of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598)). Prefiguring Japanese ability to imitate the West in industriousness they developed a skill in the making of guns, while Roman Catholic Christianity had great success in the southern island of Kyushu.

Eventually, [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu#Ieyasu's_character) set the stage for Japan’s nearly three hundred year exile from the congress of nations, turning his back on Hideyoshi’s adventurousness. Of course, it is false to assume that the Japanese were totally insulated from the outside world. Not only did they connect with the West through the Dutch, but the Japanese maintained a more intense relationship with Korea. Even in the 17th and 18th century, a movement of [“Western Learning”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangaku#History) persisted through the interaction with the Dutch (though arguably late Confucian influences may have been more significant).

But the Edo period’s reduction in distribution and production of lethal firearms shows the upside of a conservative and controlling social land political elite. Violence continued, but it was relatively controlled andchanneled.

But science fiction offers up an alternative possibility far more like Edo period Japan: technologically stagnant, culturally conservative. Frank Herbert’s [Dune](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00O3H6U28/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77) was set in the context of a universe where there had been a religious jihad against artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Isaac Asimov’s [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011M97Y5G/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77) series was originally based on imperial Rome, but later incarnations admitted that the better model was imperial China. Just as in the[Dune](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00O3H6U28/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77)series, the[Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011M97Y5G/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0192862154&linkCode=w61&imprToken=7KpG2TYroU7EEPKoYJfP8w&slotNum=77)universe had to grapple with humanity’s protean and chaotic violence, which threatened to take down our civilization periodically due to enthusiasms.

The Edo period stretches from the early 17th century down to the middle of the 19th. All in all this is not a bad run. Our own republic’s 250 year anniversary will be on us in 2026.
