Hui have a lot of West Eurasian Y chromosomes

It’s been a while since I checked in on the genetics of the [Hui people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people). I found the paper, [Analysis of 17 Y‐STR loci haplotype and Y‐chromosome haplogroup distribution in five Chinese ethnic groups](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elps.201500089). About 50% of the Y chromosomal haplogroups are normally classified as “West Eurasian” (R, E, G, I and J). But curious a fraction of the Han have these too, as do some Tibetans.

Additionally, know that some Mongols also have R1a1a. It’s hard to differentiate different periods of admixture. But to me the presence of [R2](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Haplogroup_R2_(Y-DNA).html) and [J2](https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_J2_Y-DNA.shtml#J2a_India)point to a Central/South Asian origin of a lot of the Hui R1a as well.
