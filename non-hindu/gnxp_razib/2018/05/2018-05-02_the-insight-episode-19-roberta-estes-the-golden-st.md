The Insight, Episode 19: Roberta Estes, the Golden State Killer, and forensic genetics

We’re at[71 iTunes ratings](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2). **I would appreciate it if readers of this weblog could help us make it to 100 (**then I’ll stop pestering you). Also, we only have 5 reviews on [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight).

This week we’re talking to [Roberta Estes](https://dna-explained.com/) about the arrest of the suspect in the [“Golden State Killings”](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article209779364.html). We kind put this together really quickly since it seemed relevant, and Roberta, Spencer and I have some competency in this area (we’ve all been talking to science journalists). The biggest takeaway from our conversation is that **we were a little surprised that it took this long to apply 21st century genomics to forensics.**

When I first heard about the arrest I told my wife that it probably was due to a relative match on something like GEDMatch. After the media reported that it was a “new method” I dismissed my supposition because relative matches aren’t a new or novel thing. Well, it turned out that’s exactly what they were talking about!

A lot of the story here is how law enforcement snapped a bunch of pieces together that were out there. The horse has left the barn, and everyone is trying to figure out how to deal with it.
