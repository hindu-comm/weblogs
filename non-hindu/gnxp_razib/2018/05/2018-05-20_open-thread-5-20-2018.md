Warren Treadgold’s [![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/universityweneed.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/universityweneed.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0742NGHS1/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B0742NGHS1&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JPAwNrU.R6z2AcwrU0NJLA&slotNum=10)[The University We Need: Reforming American Higher Education](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0742NGHS1/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B0742NGHS1&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JPAwNrU.R6z2AcwrU0NJLA&slotNum=10) is going to come out in early July, but I’ve written my review. Don’t know when *NRO* will post it. In general, I’m positive. Though Treadgold has some ideological issues with Leftism in the academy, much of the book is apolitical and shines the light structural problems with contemporary academia.

So I checked some of the footnotes in[The University We Need](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0742NGHS1/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B0742NGHS1&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JPAwNrU.R6z2AcwrU0NJLA&slotNum=10), and it turns out he’s a skeptic about the accolades given to Chris Wickham’s [Framing the Early Middle Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199212961/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B01M7SP1L7&linkCode=w61&imprToken=.gSfZh7g2TJFabTuLCey6Q&slotNum=12). Myself, I think both of these huge books are worth reading.

[Bernard Lewis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernard-lewis-1526854333) has died. He gets a lot of bad press from people like Edward Said of [Orientalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00NDTUDIY/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B01M7SP1L7&linkCode=w61&imprToken=.gSfZh7g2TJFabTuLCey6Q&slotNum=12) fame, and over the last 20 years has become inextricably connected to neoconservatives who cheered on our nation’s foreign adventures. But a lot of his work is pretty interesting, especially the earlier stuff. I like [The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684832801/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B01M7SP1L7&linkCode=w61&imprToken=.gSfZh7g2TJFabTuLCey6Q&slotNum=12).

[On The Number Of Siblings And p-th Cousins In A Large Population Sample](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/03/145599). I can’t say I follow all the mathematical details but jump to equation 7. But this preprint heavily informs Edge & Coop’s [How lucky was the genetic investigation in the Golden State Killer case?](https://gcbias.org/2018/05/07/how-lucky-was-the-genetic-investigation-in-the-golden-state-killer-case/)

[The Coming Wave of Murders Solved by Genealogy](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/the-coming-wave-of-murders-solved-by-genealogy/560750/?utm_source=twb). The horse has left the barn and the great rush is on. Ultimatley this all going to be a normal part of forensic work soon enough.

Is this because so much of this stuff has now percolated across our culture (e.g., the increased demand for horses in the late 19th century due to complementarity with railroads).

That being said there is a lot of specific detail that’s of interest. For example, the proportion of households with telephones during the Great Depression dropped, but those with radios kept increasing as a fraction of the American populace. The reason is that telephones were rented and required recurrent payments, which many families could no longer afford, while radios were purchased once, after which usage was free.

I don’t know much about Jordan Peterson. Curiously the people who talk to me about him the most are moderate liberals who are annoyed about the demonization of him by the further Left. I don’t have much to say, except it’s shocking how many [patrons](https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson) he has, and, the Left-media attacks on him probably are making him*more*popular.

Men are far more dangerous than women:

You know why.

The new book, [The Book of Why](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075CR9QBJ/geneexpressio-20), is important.
