Bro do you even supplement?

For a while now I’ve been telling my cofounders at [DNAGeeks.com](https://dnageeks.com/products/thou-shalt-read-the-supplement?utm_source=supplement_blog_post&utm_medium=dnageeks) that we need to do a shirt about reading supplements.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, **you’re a heathen.** Basically, if I blog about a paper, I try and read the supplements, because there’s a lot of good stuff (often the method or provenance of samples) in there that can’t be put into the paper proper. The restrictions of modern publishing are kind of crap, but they are what they are.

Also, supplements are usually a better guide to future research and directions if you look close. Better than the “discussion” section.

**I’ve already bought one of the [t-shirts](https://dnageeks.com/products/thou-shalt-read-the-supplement?utm_source=supplement_blog_post&amp;utm_medium=dnageeks).** This is obviously a “niche” product, but who knows? I’m definitely going to wear it at ASHG 2018.
