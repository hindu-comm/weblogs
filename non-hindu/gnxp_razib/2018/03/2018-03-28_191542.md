On the eons of salutary neglect

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/neandenisovan.jpg?resize=625%2C498&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/neandenisovan.jpg?resize=625%2C498&ssl=1)](https://peerj.com/preprints/26782/)  
New preprint, [Something old, something borrowed: Admixture and adaptation in human evolution](https://peerj.com/preprints/26782/). This part jumped out at me:

> …Indeed, for most traits, the contribution of archaic human alleles to > present-day human phenotypic variation is not significantly larger > than those of randomly drawn non-introgressed alleles occurring at the > same frequency in modern humans. **Interestingly, in both studies, neurological and behavioral phenotypes are an exception, with Neanderthal alleles contributing more to variation in these traits than frequency-matched modern human alleles.**

But seriously, I was thinking today about one particular stage of human evolutionary history, the long sojourn outside of Africa for the ancestors of non-Africans (including “Basal Eurasians”) which produced a sustained bottleneck. In [David Reich’s](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45) new book he alludes to it, and I’ve seen other mentions of it (this is an [old idea](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/we-were-all-africans-before-the-intermission/)).

How long was the bottleneck? What was the normal census size? What were the cultural implications of having a small isolated population?

The PSMC and MSMC diagrams I’ve seen don’t really answer my questions.
