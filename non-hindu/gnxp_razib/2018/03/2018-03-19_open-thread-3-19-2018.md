I haven’t finished it, but now I understand why it is one of the most assigned books for undergraduates: **it’s concise yet facile superficiality would appeal to a know-it-all twenty year old.** What’s more disturbing, though I guess not surprising, is that [Imagined Communities](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1784786756/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=067403306X&linkCode=w61&imprToken=8Lfko-E9WPxZrdfR-P4cAA&slotNum=60) communities is a book that I’ve seen name-checked for years by various public intellectuals. Did they read the book?

It’s not that the book is incredibly wrong. It’s just that there’s not that much there in my opinion.

Been enjoying sampling the [Philosophize This!](http://philosophizethis.org/) podcast.

[Pleistocene North African genomes link Near Eastern and sub-Saharan African human populations](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/03/14/science.aar8380). Haven’t blogged it because I haven’t read the supplements.

[Relationship between Deleterious Variation, Genomic Autozygosity, and Disease Risk: Insights from The 1000 Genomes Project](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(18)30058-2).

This is big.

[‘Serial Bomber’ Is Suspected in Explosions That Have Put Austin on Edge](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/austin-bombings-explosion.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news). Twitter was useless yesterday as most of the people seemed more enraged at the media for not laying the blame on white supremacists or Muslim radicals, as opposed to those getting killed or injured.

[Cohort-wide deep whole genome sequencing and the allelic architecture of complex traits](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/16/283481).

Feeling like I should reread [The End of History and the Last Man](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743284550/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691024421&linkCode=w61&imprToken=JMXQNmVCabkDH1ocvymQmQ&slotNum=96). Feels like history has started again….

Some people ask me about how I read fast. Part of the answer is that **I read a lot in a specific area at the same time.** Also, you can read fast if you know a lot about a topic. For example, a substantial portion of [Who We Are and How We Got Here](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110187032X/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=rWLZqs7QN1xoD8Ni8-9bHA&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0275961036&linkCode=w61&imprToken=T0XqexeBoDXvoyr0cR1T6A&slotNum=45) involves going over four and three population tests. I know what those are, so I read those sections quickly.

Finally going to hunker down and figure out which plugin is causing the 500 error on this website.

Just a reminder, please subscribe to the [podcast on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) or [Sticher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight) and review it (positively). I’ll stop with the flogging when people no longer tell me “Oh, I didn’t know you had a podcast!”

This week we’ll I’m interviewing Milford Wolpoff (that is, what’s going live).
