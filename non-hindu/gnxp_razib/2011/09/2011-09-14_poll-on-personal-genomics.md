Poll on personal genomics

[Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/09/nature-poll-for-scientists-on-personal-genomic-analysis.php) points me to a *Nature* survey on [personal genomics for scientific researchers](http://readerpanel.nature.com/wix4/p749640296.aspx?source=exblog). With price points down to \$200 or so many scientists have been at least genotyped. Though it varies by domain. Many molecular biologists seem intrigued by the novelty of personal genotyping services. In contrast, in a room of a dozen or so population geneticists and the like nearly half are liable to have already gone through some service.

All that being said, I havenâ€™t heard from people who want to make their genotype public in a long, long, time. Has the steam run out of that project? You might hear from me again with a subtle twist on this in the near future.
