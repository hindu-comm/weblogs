Rational optimist or scientific racist?

I’m quite looking forward to Steven Pinker’s [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670022950/geneexpressio-20). It’s coming out in three weeks, so expect to hear a lot more about it. That violence has declined is known outside of Pinker’s own work, and I try and spread this “good news” as much as I can. But I’ve always found it peculiar that some of the most pessimistic and skeptical individuals in regards to these data aren’t reactionaries pining for the ancient idyll, but self-styled progressives who seem to believe that we are fallen creatures. Many of the latter are clearly modern followers of Rousseau, previously discussed in [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142003344/geneexpressio-20).

In any case, [Jerry Coyne](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/steve-pinkers-new-book/) points me to a really strange aside in a [review](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2011/sep/18/observer-profile-steven-pinker) of Pinker’s book in *The Guardian*:

> To be tagged as a credulous optimist is one thing, yet Pinker also > risks being condemned as a scientific racist. His graphs on the > incidence of murder show present-day tribal and hunter-gatherer cultures to be far more homicidal than even the most lethally armed developed nation, a fact that is bound to bring censure from those Pinker derides as the “anthropologists of peace”

If the reviewer is characterizing these “anthropologists of peace” correctly perhaps it’s a commentary on what modern anthropology has become. I’ll leave you with some charts….
