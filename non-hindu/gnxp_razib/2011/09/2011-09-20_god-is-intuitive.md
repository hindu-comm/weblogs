God is intuitive

**Update:** An [ungated version of the paper](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-ofp-shenhav.pdf).

I [used to spend](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/04/levels-of-analysis-of-religion-atran-boyer-wilson/) a lot more time talking about cognitive science of religion on this weblog. It was an interest of mine, but I’ve come to a general resolution of what I think on this topic, and so I don’t spend much time discussing it. But in the comments below there was a lot of fast & furious accusation, often out of ignorance. I personally find that a little strange. I’ve been involved in [freethought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought) organizations in the past, and so have some acquaintance with “professional atheists.” Additionally, I’ve also been a participant and observer of the internet freethought websites since the mid-1990s (yes, I remember when [alt.atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt.atheism) was relevant!). In other words, I know of whom I speak (and I am not completely unsympathetic to their role in the broader ecology of ideas).

But the bigger issue is a cognitive model of how religiosity emerges. Luckily for me a paper came out which speaks to many of the points which I alluded to, [Divine intuition: Cognitive style influences belief in God](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2011-21081-001):

> Some have argued that belief in God is intuitive, a natural > (by-)product of the human mind given its cognitive structure and > social context. **If this is true, the extent to which one believes in > God may be influenced by one’s more general tendency to rely on > intuition versus reflection.** Three studies support this hypothesis, > linking intuitive cognitive style to belief in God. Study 1 showed > that individual differences in cognitive style predict belief in God. > Participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, > 2005), which employs math problems that, although easily solvable, > have intuitively compelling incorrect answers. Participants who gave > more intuitive answers on the CRT reported stronger belief in God. > This effect was not mediated by education level, income, political > orientation, or other demographic variables. Study 2 showed that the > correlation between CRT scores and belief in God also holds when > cognitive ability (IQ) and aspects of personality were controlled. > Moreover, both studies demonstrated that intuitive CRT responses > predicted the degree to which individuals reported having strengthened > their belief in God since childhood, but not their familial > religiosity during childhood, suggesting a causal relationship between > cognitive style and change in belief over time. Study 3 revealed such a causal relationship over the short term: Experimentally inducing a mindset that favors intuition over reflection increases self-reported belief in God.

Recall that in many social domains where neurotypicals rely on innate, intuitive, and “fast” cognition, high functioning autistic individuals must reflect and reason. I don’t have access to the original paper, but there’s a nice [piece](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/09/intuitive-try-god/) in *Harvard Gazette* on the research. Here’s the last sentence: ““How people think about tricky math problems is reflected in their thinking — and ultimately their convictions — about the metaphysical order of the universe,” Shenhav said.”
