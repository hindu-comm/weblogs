Singularity Summit 2011

That time of the year for a certain type of nerd, the [Singularity Summit](http://www.singularitysummit.com/). Here’s a [a preview](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/09/21/singularity-summit-in-nyc-to-explore-historic-watson-victory/):

> This Singularity > Summit[line-up](http://www.singularitysummit.com/program)this year > features a[mix of 25 > speakers](http://www.singularitysummit.com/program)from numerous > fields, with a central focus on robotics and artificial intelligence, > in particular the victory of the IBM > computer[Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer))in*Jeopardy!*this > February. Inventor and award-winning author Ray Kurzweil will give the > opening keynote on “From Eliza to Watson to Passing the Turing Test”. > Registration for the Summit, which runs on October 15-16 at the 92Y in > New York, is[open to the public > now](https://www.singularitysummit.com/registration/). >
> The theme of the Summit this year is the Watson victory and future > Watson applications, such as in medicine.[Dan > Cerutti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1U8ckr95IA), IBM’s VP of > Commercialization for Watson, will give a talk on medical applications > for Watson, and the closing keynote will be by[Ken > Jennings](http://ken-jennings.com/), who won 74 > consecutive*Jeopardy!*matches only to lose to Watson in February. > Watson won \$1,000,000 in the contest and Jennings won \$300,000, > coming in second place. Jennings’ talk will be “The Human Brain in > Jeopardy: Computers That “Think”.

I won’t be able to make it because I’m very busy right now, but that’s too bad. Ken Jennings is a great headliner, but do [look at all the speakers](http://www.singularitysummit.com/program). [Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/) and [Sonia Arrison](http://soniaarrison.com/) will be there. I had lunch with some of the practitioners of [Masonomics](http://economics.gmu.edu/) a few years back, but Tyler and Bryan Caplan were both out of town. No doubt the day will come. Just not this day. I haven’t had time to review [100 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465019668/geneexpressio-20) (alas, the neglect of the [Razib Khan on Books](http://razibkhanbooks.com/) website), but it’s an excellent take on the possible implications of greater longevity (no, I don’t think longevity research is crazy as such, though I’m probably not as optimistic as many in the community).
