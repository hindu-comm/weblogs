A college degree as contraceptive

**Update:** [The *Slate* piece](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/a-college-degree-as-contraceptive/comment-page-1/#comment-91912) is not accurately representing the original research:

> Lerner’s article is spreading misinformation. What the Guttmacher > Institute study shows is not that the educated are having fewer children vis a vis the uneducated, but that there is a growing gap in family planning: the children of the uneducated are increasingly unplanned.

[Knocked Up and Knocked Down: Why America’s widening fertility class divide is a problem](http://www.slate.com/toolbar.aspx?action=print&id=2304649):

It being *Slate*, the author does not broach what I like to term the [“Idiocracy hypothesis”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy). I invite you to make some observations at a [Walmart Supercenter](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=people+of+walmart&aq=0&oq=people+of+wal) as you stand behind the pregnant 16 year old holding her adorable chubby infant, and then deny the possibility of this outcome. But you don’t need to “go there.” If you have a strong environmental leaning you can still admit that the cultural traits of the middle class may be heritable through acquisition in childhood, while the dysfunctional tendencies of the underclass can also be perpetuated by modeling the behavior of parents and peers. The skewed parental origins of the next generation, and the inferred long term divergence in reproductive output, are issues of some consequence for the broader social order. Systems which shift out of equilibrium may eventually reach a new “stable state,” and one not to our liking.

  
In any case, here is some [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) data on the mean number of children by age cohort broken down by education for women surveyed after the year 2000. Basically you’re looking at the number of children that women born in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, had by the 2000s.

Solutions? One quick one made by [Randall Parker](http://futurepundit.com/) is to allow for easier acceleration of education of the academically gifted. Many school districts seem to discourage skipping grades from what I have seen for practical social reasons. But currently women with professional aspirations have a difficult time having children during their peak fertility years because of the necessary demands on their time of university and graduate or professional school. It is of course true that putting 14 year old teens in classes with 18 year old young adults is going to cause problems, but if a woman can make it out of medical school and into her residency around 22, rather than 26, it is going to be a huge difference in terms of options in their early 30s (beyond the peak fertility years, but not very much).
