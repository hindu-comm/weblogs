40 hits in 40 years

I’m not very interested in music compared to the average person. But I’m curious about changing tastes in music over time, because it’s part of our cultural fabric. Since I lack real “thick” knowledge in this domain, I started to think of crutches to allow me to get a slice of perception as a function of time. So what I did was look at all the [top songs by year since 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End#Billboard_year-end_number_ones), and found them on YouTube. I created a “playlist” which I could listen to all at once.
