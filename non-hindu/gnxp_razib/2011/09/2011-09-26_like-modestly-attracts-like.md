Like modestly attracts like

I saw this link posted on twitter, [IQ and Human Intelligence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1288305/):

I’ve seen these sort of results before. The review is from 1999. In general I always wonder if quantitative values for personality are not to be trusted because of issues with the measurement of personality types. But this is clearly not an issue with height or weight. And in the case of height the overwhelming causal explanation for variation in the West is genetic variation. **Overall I’m rather surprised by the rather low correlations for some of these traits, such as height and intelligence.** I wonder if beauty, perhaps measured by an index of facial symmetry, might exhibit higher correlation values?
