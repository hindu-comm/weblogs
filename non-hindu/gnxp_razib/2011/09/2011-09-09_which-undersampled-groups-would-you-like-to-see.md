Which undersampled groups would you like to see?

To my excitement I got the Tutsi (almost) and Malagasy genotypes. These are cases where N = 1 is a big deal, as opposed to N = 0. What other groups might be informative? Most of the world’s population is obviously not sampled, but they’re not always of equal interest. What would be equivalent to the Tutsi (politically relevant) or Malagasy (demographically very unique)? If I solicit funds to pay from someone’s genotyping it won’t be a successful solicitation if the interest is very narrow.
