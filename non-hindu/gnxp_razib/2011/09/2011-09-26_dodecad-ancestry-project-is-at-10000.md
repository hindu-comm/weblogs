Dodecad Ancestry Project is at ~10,000

A few days ago I noticed that the [Dodecad Ancestry Project](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2011/09/yunusbayev-et-al-2011-data-assessed.html) had nearly nearly 10,000 individuals! \~500 are participants in the project (like myself, I’m DOD075). But most of the individuals were derived from public or shared data sets. You can see them in the [Google spreadsheet with all the results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?authkey=COCa89AJ&key=0ArAJcY18g2GadDUyeEtjNnBmY09EbnowN3M3UWRyNnc&hl=en_US&authkey=COCa89AJ#gid=0). It’s quite an accomplishment, and I commend [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/) for it. I also have to enter into the record that [Dodecad](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/) prompted my own forays into genome blogging, and Dienekes also helped Zack with pointers for [Harappa](http://www.harappadna.org/) in the early days.
