Friday Fluff – September 9th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) **Post from the past:** [Introgression in wolves & dogs](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2006/07/introgression-in-wolves-dogs/).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “any gay iranians to shag.”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [Twin studies are not useless](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/of-beasts-and-men/#comment-86586):

> *It’s interesting that one of the San genomes had a non-standard FOXP2 SNP.* >
> I am wondering if this can be a sequencing error? Because if it’s not, > it’s huge. For it is not just some non-standard SNP but a full blown > missense mutation, a potentially drastic one, too – L558P. That > position is in the forkhead DNA binding domain, close to protein-DNA > interface, likely to be critical for maintaining local structure. It > seems to be absolutely conserved in mammals (I checked: monkeys, > elephants, hamsters). All that in a protein that has only three amino acid residue differences between mouse and human and it’s either a sequence error or a mutation that ought to have huge functional consequences.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
