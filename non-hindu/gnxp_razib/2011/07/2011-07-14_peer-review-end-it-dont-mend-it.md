Peer-review: end it, don't mend it

At [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/), Joe Pickrell has an important post up, [Why publish science in peer-reviewed journals?](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php):

It works for physics, computer science, and to a great extent the social sciences. Why not the biosciences?
