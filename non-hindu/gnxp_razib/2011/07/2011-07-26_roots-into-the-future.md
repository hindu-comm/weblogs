Roots into the Future

[23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) is announcing a new research initiative into African American genetics [today](http://spittoon.23andme.com/2011/07/26/roots-into-the-future/). [Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/personal-genomics-no-longer-just-for-rich-white-folks/) has blogged it so well that I recommend you just read him: [Personal genomics: not just for rich white folks](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/personal-genomics-no-longer-just-for-rich-white-folks/). This looks like it will focus more on diseases associations than ancestry inference for individuals. Very necessary and useful.
