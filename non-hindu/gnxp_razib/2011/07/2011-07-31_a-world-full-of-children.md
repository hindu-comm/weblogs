A world full of children

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/07/F11.jpg?resize=350%2C365)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/07/F11.jpg?resize=350%2C365)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/07/F11.jpg)The figure to the left is from a new paper in *Science*, [When the World’s Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.abstract). It reports the findings from 133 cemeteries in the northern hemisphere in regards to the proportion of 5-19 year old individuals. When calibrated to period when agriculture was introduced into a specific region there seems to be a clear alignment in terms of a demographic transition toward a “youth bulge.” Why? A standard model of land surplus explains part of it surely. When farmers settle “virgin land” there is often a rapid “catch up” phase toward the Malthusian limit, the carrying capacity. Another possibility though is that sedentary populations did not need to space their offspring nearly as much as mobile hunter-gatherers. Whatever the details, **the facts remain that the data do point to a shift in the age pyramid during this period.** The author wonders as to the possible cultural implications of this. There is an *a priori* assumption that a young vs. old age profile in a society constrains its choices and channels its energies (e.g., think the “baby boom” generation in the USA). A final interesting point is that the authors note that today we are seeing the last gasp of this transition toward large numbers of children, as fertility drops toward replacement all across the world. That too may have some cultural consequences.
