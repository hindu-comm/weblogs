Scientific American blogs

If you read blogs you know that [Scientific American](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/network-central/2011/07/05/welcome-the-scientific-american-blog-network/) has a [Blog Network up](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/).

Some quick links to friends of mine who have relocated:

[Crude Matter](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/crude-matter) (a.k.a Michelle)

[EvoEcoLab](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/evo-eco-lab/) (Kevin Zelnio)

[Thoughtful Animal](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/) (Jason Goldman)

[Psychotronic Girl](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psychotronic-girl/) (Melody Dye)

[The Primate Diaries](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/primate-diaries/) (Eric Michael Johnson)

In a “mature industry” there’s a lot of competition between firms, and zero sum dynamics kick in. I obviously don’t feel that we’re at this stage for the various collections of science related weblogs which have been sprouting up over the past few years. Everyone has a slightly different niche, and there’s still room for growth.
