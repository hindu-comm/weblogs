The shuttle as a flop (in numbers)

[Amos Zeeberg](https://twitter.com/#!/settostun), the person you should pester (hopefully ineffectually!) when I’m not being nice to you in the comments, has an interesting opinion piece up [lambasting the Shuttle program](http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jul-aug/22-how-to-avoid-repeating-debacle-of-space-shuttle). Here are the numbers which jumped out at me (I knew the broad outlines, but nice to have precise numbers):

> The most important thing to realize about the space shuttle program is > that it is objectively a failure. The shuttle was billed as a reusable > craft that could frequently, safely, and cheaply bring people and > payloads to low Earth orbit. NASA originally said the shuttles could > handle 65 launches per year; the most launches it actually did in a > year was nine; over the life of the program, it averaged five per > year. **NASA predicted each shuttle launch would cost \$50 million; > they actually averaged \$450 million.** NASA administrators said the > risk of catastrophic failure was around one in 100,000; NASA engineers put the number closer to one in a hundred; a more recent report from NASA said the risk on early flights was one in nine. **The failure rate was two out of 135 in the tests that matter most.**

To take the intangible value of human life out of the question, if we were going on the cheap then a 2 out of 135 failure right might be understandable. But we weren’t. The shuttle cost **a lot.** To whom much is given (in dollars) much shall be expected. It didn’t live up to the expectations.

In an unrelated vein, I wonder if the aging of the earth’s population is going to put a damper on space exploration in the short term. The explorers of the future are more likely to be de facto intelligent robots.
