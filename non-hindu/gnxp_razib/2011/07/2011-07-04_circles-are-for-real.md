Circles are for real!

[Google Circles knockoff hits Facebook courtesy of unofficial plug-in](http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/04/google-circles-knockoff-hits-facebook-courtesy-of-unofficial-plu/):

> …Circle Hack is a self-described “one-night experiment with > Javascript” created by a few Facebook engineers in a non-affiliated > capacity, which unofficially brings Google Circles-like functionality to the top social network. The creators of the Facebook plug-in have borrowed liberally from Google on this one (turnabout is fair play, perhaps)….

This is great. At a minimum Google+ could become like the Chrome browser. It might not attain a dominant market share position (though Chrome already has a higher share than IE on this site, and [others](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp), with a tech-savvy audience), **but it could push the edge of innovation.** I don’t have a problem with Facebook, but with the collapse of MySpace years ago it has had a de facto monopoly in the general social networking space.

Finally, an anecdatum: **a friend noticed that six of his contacts deactivated their Facebook accounts in the past few days.** He didn’t know why, but there’s a high probability that these may be the types who just want to start over like [Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/why-google-might-succeed/2011/05/19/AG7Di9rH_blog.html) suggested.
