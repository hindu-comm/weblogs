Summer 2011 Gene Expression Reader Survey

I’ve been taking surveys of the readership of this weblog since 2004. Here is my last one, from the [summer of 2010](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?CID=30403&SurveyID=72013). Before I moved to *Discover* I also did one in the [winter of 2010](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?SurveyID=70954). Here’s a reader survey from the winter of [2009](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/02/reader-survey-results-day-1/). Another from [2005](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/reader-survey.php).

I set up a survey with a new service this time. I did integrate some of the suggestions of commenters as well. One difference between this survey and previous ones is that I have a lot more free-form text boxes with numeric answers. So you give your specific age or income, instead of selecting from a category. The survey shouldn’t take more than \~5 minutes, as many of the questions are yes/no, or very simple, such as your highest education attained.

I’ll post the first results within 24 hours, and probably post the raw files at some point in the near future if you want to crunch them yourself. I set it up so it goes from banal demographic questions in the beginning to more detailed and somewhat esoteric queries by the end. None of the questions are mandatory.

[You can complete the survey at this link: **http://questionpro.com/t/ACQlIZK0wT**](http://questionpro.com/t/ACQlIZK0wT).

**Update:** Might as well point you to the [early results](http://questionpro.com/s/1-515702-2462467) (the “open-ended” results aren’t there, I’ll have to format that for later).
