E. O. Wilson in The Atlantic

*The Atlantic* has a huge profile of [E. O. Wilson](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/e-o-wilson-s-theory-of-everything/8686/?single_page=true) up. The main course is his new book, [The Social Conquest of Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871404133/geneexpressio-20). It seems to be an elaboration of some of the ideas in the infamous [Martin Nowak](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/nature09205.html) paper which resulted in a huge counter-response from biologists. But this part was kind of fun:

> Wilson defined sociobiology for me as “the systematic study of the > biological basis of all forms of social behavior in all organisms.” > Gould savagely mocked both Wilson’s ideas and his supposed hubris in a > 1986 essay titled “Cardboard Darwinism,” in The New York Review of Books, for seeking “to achieve the greatest reform in human thinking about human nature since Freud,” and Wilson still clearly bears a grudge. >
> **“I believe Gould was a charlatan,”** he told me. “I believe that he > was … seeking reputation and credibility as a scientist and writer, > and he did it consistently by distorting what other scientists were > saying and devising arguments based upon that distortion.” It is easy to imagine Wilson privately resenting Gould for another reason, as well—namely, for choosing Freud as a point of comparison rather than his own idol, Darwin, whom he calls “the greatest man in the world.”

If you read much of my stuff you know that I don’t think much of Gould, but I have to air stuff like this so that readers won’t keep citing the man as an authority. Though perhaps it is ironic that in the case of the evolution of sociality Wilson and Gould probably share more in common in their final conclusion than they do with the evolutionary mainstream.
