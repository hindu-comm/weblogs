Gene Expression DonorsChoose

I haven’t raised that much money this year on [DonorsChoose](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=198786&utm_source=GP10&utm_medium=widget&utm_content=GP&utm_campaign=198786&max=50). No idea why that is. Perhaps I didn’t pick projects appealing to my readers? Also, I’ve frankly been too busy to bring notice to it very often. It’s great that Phil is [doing the heavy lifting](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/leadershipboard.html?category=276) for *Discover*, but I’d like to help a little more. Especially since I got this notification:

> The DonorsChoose.org Board of Directors wants to thank you for your > hard work, and to encourage readers to give, by matching all donations to Science Bloggers for Students between the first moment of Thursday October 20th and the last moment of Saturday, October 22nd (midnight to midnight Eastern time). >
> If you were involved in last year’s campaign, the mat ch will work the same way the HP match did: >
> -At the end of the three day period, all dollars donated will be totaled, and the Board of Directors will match those dollars. >
> -The number of dollars will be divided by the number of people who donated, and gift codes will be issued to every donor (via e-mail) for an equal share of the matching dollars. So, if 100 people donate \$10,000, each donor will receive a \$100 DonorsChoose.org gift code. >
> -Individuals will, in turn, have the chance to apply the funds to whatever classroom project they choose.

In other financial news, [John Wilkins](https://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/10/a-shameless-pathetic-begging-letter-give-me-money-or-god-will-take-me-to-heaven/) of [Evolving Thoughts](evolvingthoughts.net/2011/10/a-shameless-pathetic-begging-letter-give-me-money-or-god-will-take-me-to-heaven/) is going through a rough patch. He’s asking for [donations via PayPal](https://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/10/a-shameless-pathetic-begging-letter-give-me-money-or-god-will-take-me-to-heaven/). John has produced **a lot** of great content over the years. Tipping him some would be more of a payment for services rendered than a charitable contribution.
