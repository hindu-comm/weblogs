Australia on fire

Fascinating, [Orbital cycles, Australian lake levels, and the arrival of aborigines](https://lablemminglounge.blogspot.com/2011/10/orbital-cycles-australian-lake-levels.html):

If you read some of the academic literature on fire ecology you have a hard time not coming to the conclusion that **modern humans terraformed the planet Earth!** The hallmark of modern *H. sapiens* seems to be extinction of large organisms, a propensity to go where no hominin has gone before, and copious utilization of the “red flower.”
