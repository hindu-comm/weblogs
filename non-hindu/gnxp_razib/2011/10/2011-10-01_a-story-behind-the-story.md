A story behind the story

[David Dobbs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/09/cutting-to-the-chase-on-the-arsenic-paper/) points me to a [story](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/09/cutting-to-the-chase-on-the-arsenic-paper/) in *Popular Science* which tracks the controversy around the “arsenic life” hypothesis, and its effects on Felisa Wolfe-Simon. Back in the days before the internet you’d read the story as an outsider and get a particular take. A long narrative by its nature primes us in a certain direction through the framing of the major points. But the internet does exist. So [Carl Zimmer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/09/30/arseniclife-goes-longform-and-history-gets-squished/) put up a blog post highlighting a chronology which undercuts one of the implications of the *Popular Science* piece, or at least one of the talking points of Felisa Wolfe-Simon. This [elicited a response from the author of the piece](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/10/01/tom-clynes-on-arsenic-life/), which Carl posted. Even if you’re not deep into the weeds of the “arsenic life” controversy (I’m not) it is still fascinating to see how a conversation which might have been hidden in the back channels is now relatively transparent. Science itself it is the conversation that tells the true tale. A conventional general interest reader might stop at the *Popular Science* piece, but those outside of science but more deeply curious are going to now be privy to the continuous conversation.
