The Ötzi embargo

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/10/citizen-genetics.html) has some harsh words for the way *some* science is produced, focusing on the genome of Ötzi the Iceman as a case in point:

> Yesterday, > I[twitted](https://twitter.com/#%21/dienekesp/status/127795893738024960)in > exasperation that Otzi’s genome, which must have been available in at > least some sort of draft form since at least the beginning of this > year, has been under lock and key, presumably because of the need to > make a big splash with the simultaneous > Bolzano[conference](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/10/tyrolean-iceman-week-is-upon-us-and.html), TV[special](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/10/iceman-stories-begin-arriving.html), likely imminent journal publication, and all the media stories that will follow.

What I don’t understand: how come no one is editing the [Wikipedia entry ahead of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi_the_Iceman#Genetic_analysis)? I wonder in hindsight if there’s no there, there, though I hope I’m wrong about this. Going by the lack of [media mention](https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&btnmeta_news_search=1&q=%C3%96tzi#q=%C3%96tzi&hl=en&safe=off&gl=us&tbm=nws&source=lnt&tbs=qdr:w&sa=X&ei=P6mkTsWbKaHTiAL468B2&ved=0CA0QpwUoAw&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=9cd54be5ed078bd5&biw=1334&bih=643) of ahead of the [NOVA](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/iceman-murder-mystery.html) documentary I do suspect we’re seeing the calm before the embargo explosion.
