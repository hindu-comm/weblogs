In the year 2015….

Recently I was having a discussion with some friends about getting the full genomes of everyone in my immediate family when the price point comes down to \$1,000, just as I have had my immediately family genotyped. You can find some interesting stuff just from the genotype alone, which for current affordable platforms aims for \~1 million variant markers out of \~3 billion base pairs. For example, I inferred that two of my siblings have a coefficient of relatedness of \~0.41, 3 standard deviations below the expectation of 0.50. Another way to put it might be that they’re 1/3rd of the way to being half-siblings! With whole genomes the opportunities are even greater. You could for example ascertain the distribution of novel mutations by comparing parental genomes to offspring. I also began to consider the fact that we might start developing intuitions about the expected number of new mutations a child should have based on how old their parents are.

This led me to reread Armand Leroi’s 2006 piece, [The future of neo-eugenics. Now that many people approve the elimination of certain genetically defective fetuses, is society closer to screening all fetuses for all known mutations?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1794693/?tool=pubmed)One particular section jumped out at me because it is surprisingly dated for a five-year-old essay:

> One impediment to a universal, total prenatal screen for all known > mutations **is the invasive nature of the procedure—it requires > amniocentesis…or chorionic sampling to retrieve cells from the > amniotic sac**—and the traumatic nature of the treatment, which is > therapeutic abortion. Perhaps, then, a total mutation screen will not > be used in prenatal diagnosis, but rather in preimplantation genetic > diagnosis (PGD). This procedure tests embryos produced by in vitro > fertilization (IVF) for chromosomal abnormalities and specific > mutations before implantation, by removing a single cell from the > embryo at the eight-cell stage. Healthy embryos are then implanted; > poor embryos—showing one or several abnormalities—are frozen or discarded. As in prenatal diagnosis, PGD is generally carried out only when a family medical history suggests that the embryo is at risk of a specific disease….

Within the next few years [we’ll be able to ascertain a fetus’ genotype from a simple blood test](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/business/sequenom-test-for-down-syndrome-raises-hopes-and-questions.html?sq=down%20syndrome&st=Search&scp=2&pagewanted=print). I think this is going to make a **huge difference**. Amniocentesis and [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling) are both stressful for expectant parents, because you’re told repeatedly about the miscarriage risks. With a blood test the barrier to entry is reduced considerably.

Another aspect of the essay is that in 2006 I recall many people feeling that Leroi had not addressed ethical objections to this sort of procedure robustly enough. But at this point it seems as if a lot of the developments which he foresaw are near fruition, and people aren’t making a big fuss about it. Why? Because it’s one of those things that happens gradually, and the potentially ethically dubious becomes normalized.
