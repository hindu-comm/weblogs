In which states do grandchildren live at home?

I recently noted that the [SDA Archive](http://sda.berkeley.edu/archive.htm) has an [American Community Survey](http://sda.usa.ipums.org/cgi-bin/sdaweb/hsda?harcsda+2006-2008) interface. The ACS has huge sample sizes because the US government can afford to do extensive surveys. And naturally you find some really interesting facts. For example, there’s a variable which tells you about the presence of *grandchildren* in the household. In some nations this wouldn’t be a big deal, but in the USA it is not too common. You can also look at this by state, which is what I did. Then I compared the total proportion to those limited with college degrees or higher. No surprise, those with college degrees tended to be less likely to have grandchildren living at home…. But can you guess which state has the highest proportion of grandchildren living at home? And which states deviate from the trendline? Surprises to me….
