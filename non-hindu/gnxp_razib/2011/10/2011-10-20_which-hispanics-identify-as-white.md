Which Hispanics identify as white?



I wanted to clarify a few issues with the Census’ [American Community Survey](http://sda.usa.ipums.org/cgi-bin/sdaweb/hsda?harcsda+2006-2008). These data come from the interval of 2006-2008, and they allowed me to query the proportional of various Latino/Hispanic groups who identified as white. I knew in the aggregate that the majority of America’s Latinos identified as white, but I was curious about two things:

1\) The variation in white identification by group (by national origin)

2\) The variation in white identification of Mexican Americans by selected states

Results below. There are stories in these data….
