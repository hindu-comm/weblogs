Up with nurses! Down with doctorates!

In light of growing health care costs and the demographic reality of an aging profession stories like this one in *The New York Times* are both depressing and hopeful. [Calling the Nurse ‘Doctor,’ a Title Physicians Oppose](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/health/policy/02docs.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print):

Physical therapists once needed only bachelor’s degrees, too, but the profession will require doctorates of all students by 2015 — **the same year that nursing leaders intend to require doctorates of all those becoming nurse practitioners.** >

I applaud the wider distribution of medical services outside of the licensing monopoly of M.D.s. As an empirical matter I think there was a practical reason for the professionalization of medicine in the 20th century and the emergence of degree holding as necessary. To be frank about it for most of human history doctors were frauds or butchers. Modern medicine in the 20th century was a major revolution in that sense (though doctors are only part of it, the rise of an effective pharmaceutical industry is probably just as important if not more so). But the arrow of history does not always move in one direction, and we live in an “information age.” Doctors are human, and therefore fallible. They need the aid of both their patients and various other medical professionals to optimize health outcomes. The paternalistic model is just not viable in the long run, especially as the median educational qualifications of their patients keeps rising.

But notice that in this case we’re seeing greater and greater credentialism in fields which were traditionally perceived to be auxiliary to medical doctors. This is not a good sign. Instead of challenging the unquestioned prominence of medical doctors in domains where nurses are sufficient and more cost effective, the nursing profession is “fighting fire with fire.” This is not going to end well. Having to pile on education removes productive years in the work force. This is justifiable when education results in gains in productivity, but just as in education, I suspect that all the extra years for physical therapists and nurses is not doing anything but signalling, and further tightening up labor supply as the number of patients keeps on increasing because of the aging of the population.
