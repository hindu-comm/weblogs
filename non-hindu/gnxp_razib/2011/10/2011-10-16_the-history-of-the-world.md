The history of the world!

My post from last week, [Relative angels and absolute demons](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/10/relative-angels-and-absolute-demons/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GeneExpressionBlog+%28Gene+Expression%29), got a lot of circulation. Interestingly I received several emails from self-described lurkers who asked me for recommendations on world history, with a particular thought to rectify deficiencies in non-European history. These were people who were not looking for exceedingly abstruse monographs. Below are some suggestions….

  
[China: A History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465015808/geneexpressio-20). The author is a journalist, so this should be a starting off point, as there are major shortcomings in the narrative. But if you don’t have much background I’d recommend this.

[India: A History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802145582/geneexpressio-20). Same author as above, same strengths and weaknesses.

[China: A New History, Enlarged Edition](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674116739/geneexpressio-20). A classic survey. Nothing to shout home about, but useful (if sometimes thin and dated).

[Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520242254/geneexpressio-20). The author is hated by many Hindu nationalists, but the period is old enough that much of the controversy is not relevant to this work.

[When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306814803/geneexpressio-20). A narrative history of the dynasty which crystallized much of Islam as we understand it.

[Empires of the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20). This is more a magnum opus, but it’s not a dry one. It can help “connect” the histories of the peripheral zones of the Eurasian [ecumene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumene).

[A History of Iran](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465008887/geneexpressio-20). Iran is a small country, but its location is such that an understanding of it’s history can illuminate a great deal.

[Power and Plenty](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069111854X/geneexpressio-20). An economic history of the past 1,000 years.

[After Tamerlane](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596913932/geneexpressio-20). The past 600 years. Becomes progressively more Eurocentric, as it should.

[The Early Chinese Empires](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067402477X/geneexpressio-20). This is not a long book, and it gives you a sense of what China was like before foreign influences (e.g., Buddhism).

[The Classical World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465024963//geneexpressio-20). Most people know very little of Western antiquity.

[God’s War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674023870/geneexpressio-20). This history of the Crusades ranges from the Baltic to Egypt. It has a wide enough spatial and temporal coverage to be a world history.

[The Peacock Throne](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/812080225X/geneexpressio-20). To some extent this treatment of Mughal India almost seems out of Bollywood in terms of its dramatic nature. But then again the Timurids provide great raw material.

[Africa](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067973869X/geneexpressio-20). The title is short, but the yield is long.

[1491](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400032059/geneexpressio-20). Many people know everything in this book, but too few still.

[A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000 – 323 BC](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405149116/geneexpressio-20). This is an understudied subject. You need this to see long term patterns which began only with the Classical Greeks.

[The Rise of Western Christendom](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631221387/geneexpressio-20). You can’t understand the core of antiquity and the roots of the Middle Ages without this book.

[The Human Web](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039305179X/geneexpressio-20). A world history co-authored by one of the masters, William H. McNeill.

That’s all for now. I haven’t updated it in a while, but you might want to check out [Razib on books](http://razibkhanbooks.com/).
