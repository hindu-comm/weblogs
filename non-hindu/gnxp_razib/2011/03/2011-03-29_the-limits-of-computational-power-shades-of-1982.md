First, wish Zack well. Second, he has over [70 individuals](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuW3R0Ys-P4HdGE4eDh6emt1dUs2U2pXTkVjS0lsV1E&hl=en) in the [Harappa Ancestry Project](http://www.harappadna.org/) data base (in addition to the public data sets). If you’re South Asian, Iranian, Burmese, or Tibetan, here are the [details of participation](http://www.harappadna.org/about/).
