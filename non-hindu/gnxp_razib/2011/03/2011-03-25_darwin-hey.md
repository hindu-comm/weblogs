Darwin, eh?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/03/Jigokudani_hotspring_in_Nagano_Japan_001.jpg?resize=200%2C184)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/03/Jigokudani_hotspring_in_Nagano_Japan_001.jpg?resize=200%2C184)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/03/Jigokudani_hotspring_in_Nagano_Japan_001.jpg)At [The Intersection](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/03/25/origins-of-mankind-canada-vs-the-united-states/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DiscoverIntersection+%28The+Intersection%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher) Sheril Kirshenbaum posts some rather stark data from Gallup and a Canadian outfit on the differences in attitudes toward evolution between Americans and Canadians. Those Tories *are* different! The answers seem very similar to those on offer for the [General Social Survey’s](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08) “CREATION” question. I thought I’d compare Canadians to various American demographics. The question was asked in 2004 of over 1,400 Americans. I find it somewhat ironic in that I think there has been some question as to the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, and his attitude toward evolution. Harper is a member of the Evangelical Protestant [Christian and Missionary Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_and_Missionary_Alliance) (and apparently has appointed known Creationists to various government positions, something controversial or notable in Canada). In contrast, Barack Hussein Obama is famously [more grounded in evolution than angels](https://books.google.com/books?id=F6HAasv2v-4C&pg=PA458&dq=evolution+angels+obama&hl=en&ei=R9CMTf_QFob6sAOC-9SBCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false).
