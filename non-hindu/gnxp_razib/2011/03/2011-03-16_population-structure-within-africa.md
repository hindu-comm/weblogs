Population structure within Africa

John Hawks, [reviews](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/modern/henn-southern-africa-origins-2011.html) Henn et al., and notes:

> By the time we find “modern” humans in West Asia, the African > population had long since diversified into regional populations.

For more than a generation we’ve stated the conventional wisdom that Africa has more genetic diversity than the rest of the world. And yet far too often we’ve left it at that. With the bigger data set of Henn et al. you can get a sense that there’s a fair amount of structured variation *within* Africa which is very interesting. It is not one amorphous undifferentiated Dark Continent. Sarah Tishkoff’s [recent work](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5930/1035.abstract) has been very informative in this domain, but I’m looking for what we might find out of whole genome sequencing in particular.
