It's about heritability….

I’m going to promote [a comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/human-population-genetics-identity-politics/#comment-61623):

Granted that’s a limited analogy, but I think that’s what you’re seeing here — total confusion. Importantly, this is basically what everyone believes.

Alas, I’m not a good communicator. At least not to my satisfaction. Long time readers still speak about “nature” and “nurture” in a colloquial manner which makes it **clear** that they haven’t internalized what [heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability) implies about the irrelevance of the structure of their argument. Almost all of the discourse about genetics, and quantitative traits, whether it be behavioral or physical (e.g., obesity in the latter case), in the public domain is basically in a “not-even-wrong” category of incoherence. But we must muddle on. What else can we do? I wish [David Dobbs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/neuronculture) the best of luck with his [new enterprise](http://www.theopennotebook.com/2010/10/24/david-dobbs-the-orchid-children/).
