Bravo for Mormons!

[Trying to Relish the Big Time, Even When It Brings a Cringe](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/us/31mormon.html?pagewanted=print):

> The house lights came up and it was intermission at “The Book of > Mormon,” the new Broadway musical about a pair of innocent young > Mormon missionaries sent to Uganda to spread the faith. John Dehlin, a > graduate student who flew in from Utah to see the show with a group of > Mormons from around the country, was still riveted to his theater > seat, having flashbacks. >
> “It’s way, way too close to home,” he said, recalling his own > missionary years in Guatemala: the shock at the poverty and violence, > the pressure from the mission president to baptize more natives, the > despair when his mission companion ran off with a local girl — and the > Mormon mandate, above all, to repress doubt and remain relentlessly > cheery. >
> A friend in the crowded theater aisle, Paul Jones, passed by and gave > Mr. Dehlin a high-five and a hug. “It’s right on,” said Dr. Jones, a > dentist from Gilbert, Ariz., “but I cringed a little bit, a couple of > times.” >
> The arrival of a Broadway musical that ridicules their religion, > produced by the creators of the scathingly satirical television show > “South Park,” is proving to be a cringe-worthy moment for many > Mormons. >
> And yet, even though the very name of the show appropriates the title > of the church’s sacred scripture, there have been no pickets or > boycotts, no outraged news releases by Mormon defenders and no > lawsuits. >
> **This is intentional. Mormons want people to know that they can take > it.**

Not all religious communities react in the same way. In Birmingham, England, 2004, [Theatre attacks Sikh play protest](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4109315.stm):

> But Mohan Singh, a local Sikh community leader, said: “When they’re > doing a play about a Sikh priest raping somebody inside a gurdwara, > **would any religion take it?”** >
> The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, Vincent Nichols, said the > play was offensive to people of all faiths. >
> “The right to freedom of expression has corresponding duties to the > common good. >
> “Such a deliberate, even if fictional, violation of the sacred place > of the Sikh religion demeans the sacred places of every religion.” >
> The theatre said more than 800 people had to be evacuated, security > guards were attacked and thousands of pounds’ worth of damage was > caused. >
> A foyer door was destroyed, windows were broken in a restaurant and > demonstrators smashed equipment backstage.

There are many things you can criticize about the United States. But at least there is the *possibility* of doubt and nonconformity.
