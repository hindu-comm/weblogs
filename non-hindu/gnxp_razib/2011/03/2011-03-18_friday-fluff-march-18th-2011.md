Friday Fluff – March 18th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/11/evolution-what-the-fossils-say-and-why-it-matters/).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “cheap pretty tutus.”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“Think Twins”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/think-twins/#comment-59869):

> An interesting point. No one can create another Hitler via cloning, > nor a Charlemagne or even Mozart should their DNA be available in some > way. The problems are many and are well illustrated with a car > analogy… GM tries to produce exacting replicas of individual models > thousands of times and they do this every year. Despite their efforts, > quality varies, performance varies, endurance varies. No two vehicles > of the same model are identical. Like a car has a driver, a human has > a brain. Despite their similarities, identical twins are not identical > in all ways. >
> They say that everyone has a twin somewhere. My friends met someone > that looks nearly exactly like me. Yet other people have my same name. > None of those people are me or even like me in meaningful ways. > Cloning a human will get you a human which looks like another – > nothing more. There is nothing special in that… until genetic ID > systems are implemented. Then a clone is something different > altogether.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
