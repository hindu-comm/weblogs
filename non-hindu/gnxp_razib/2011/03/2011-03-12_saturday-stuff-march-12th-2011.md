Saturday Stuff – March 12th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

**Due to a “busy” cat-schedule, the regular Friday posting was delayed for one day. If you have a problem with it, the individual with whom you can take it up is indefinitely taking a nap. So good luck with that!**

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [The Dark Age Mighty Whitey](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/01/on-generality-of.php).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “kristin kreuk with glasses.”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“Your genes, your rights – FDA’s Jeffrey Shuren misleading testimony under oath”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/your-genes-your-rights-fdas-jeffrey-shuren-not-a-fan/#comment-59578), there were many good comments. But I’ll highlight this one from Dan:

> *Furthermore, all CLIA certified operations have to pass very stringent proficiency testing to maintain their certification. There is no such oversight for DTC operations,* >
> Joe has already noted that 23andMe, deCODEme and Pathway are CLIA-certified. I can tell you that Navigenics is as well. You’re right that some of the scurrilous operators aren’t CLIA-licensed, and that should be stopped – but that isn’t the responsibility of the FDA. >
> Even those of us who oppose FDA involvement in DTC typically agree > that regulation of analytic validity is important (CLIA is actually a > terrible system in many ways, but there currently isn’t a viable > alternative). We also believe that companies should be punished by the > FTC if they engage in false or unethical advertising. This isn’t about > regulation vs anarchy; it’s about paternalistic, unnecessary regulation that will destroy an industry and harm consumers vs sensible regulation that will protect consumers without crippling innovation. >
> *and no way to ensure that the testing is actually accurate and reproducible (I have heard through the grapevine that there is poor inter-lab correlation for many of these DTC SNP arrays).* >
> This is absolutely wrong. Comparisons between 23andMe and deCODEme > data, for instance, routinely show concordance of \>99.9%. When I compared the 23andMe and deCODEme files of Times journalist Mark Henderson last year I found a discrepancy rate of around 1 in 14,000 – substantially better than the vast majority of routine clinical tests.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
