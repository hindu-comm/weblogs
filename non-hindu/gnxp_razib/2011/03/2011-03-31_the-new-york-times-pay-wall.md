The New York Times "pay wall"

So what do readers of this blog think? Pay or no pay? It’s useful, and *The New York Times* is pretty massive in scope, if sometimes lacking in breadth. I love their [data-oriented stuff](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/), but I ignore their columnists and a lot of their “analysis,” which is frankly substandard if I know anything about the topic (which suggests to me if I *don’t* know about the topic, they barely do too). There are certain areas where blogs have a comparative advantage, and I don’t see why an organization with other strengths would even make an attempt.
