Nerd alert!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/03/a-dance-with-dragons_240.jpg?resize=240%2C365)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/03/a-dance-with-dragons_240.jpg?resize=240%2C365)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801473/geneexpressio-20)Apparently July 12th, 2011, is now a hard date for the publication of George R. R. Martin’s [A Dance with Dragons](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553801473/geneexpressio-20), the 5th book in his [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) series. Martin [has confirmed the date on his website](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/if-update.html): “Barring tsunamis, general strikes, world wars, or asteroid strikes, you will have the novel in your hands on July 12. I hope you like it.” He even has a late-1990s style countdown going. For what it’s worth, the first book, [A Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//B004H99QQ4/geneexpressio-20), came out in the summer of 1996. That means that a 10 year old starting the series in 1996 would be 25 now. In all probability this is going to be \~10 books, so who knows how old that 10 year will be when it’s all done.

Personally, I found that the [last book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553582038/geneexpressio-20) was kind of a let down. Amazon reviewers seem to agree, as books 1-3 got 4.5 stars, but book 4 only 3. If Martin can’t bounce back, I assume that this series going to go the way of [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_wheel_of_time) (before it was resurrected after the death of the author by Brandon Sanderson). At least [Patrick Rothfuss](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0756404738/geneexpressio-20) has his second book out. Now, where to find the time so that I can actually read this stuff some day….
