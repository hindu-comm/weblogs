Around the Web ‚Äì August 3rd, 2011

[Culture of Science](http://www.cultureofscience.com/). The peripatetic Sheril Kirshenbaum‚Äôs new weblog. Though I think she‚Äôs going to stay put for a while now.

[The Life-Spans of Empires](http://arbesman.net/blog/2011/08/02/the-life-spans-of-empires/). I‚Äôll be talking about this paper soon.

[Academics ‚ÄòGuest Authoring‚Äô Ghostwritten Medical Journal Articles Should Be Charged With Fraud, Legal Experts Argue](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110802180820.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). Crankery in the area of medicine flourishes in part due to natural cognitive biases, but also because there are many cases of crookedness and manufactured science.

[First Large Study to Find HIV Epidemic Among Gays in the Middle East](http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/~3/PqVv9-Myn3E/110802180835.htm). Seems to be following the Western model.

  
[Are Pet Owners Healthier and Happier? Maybe Not‚Ä¶](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110802180825.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29) Would that it were true.

[Is Our Universe Inside a Bubble? First Observational Test of the ‚ÄòMultiverse‚Äô](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110803102844.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). I‚Äôm too ignorant to comment.

[Copy Number Variation in Familial Parkinson Disease](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020988?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FGeneticsandGenomics+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Genetics+and+Genomics%29). More than SNPs.

[Drunken Ben Bernanke Tells Everyone At Neighborhood Bar How Screwed U.S. Economy Really Is](https://www.theonion.com/articles/drunken-ben-bernanke-tells-everyone-at-neighborhoo,21059/).

[Germany Investigating Facebook Tagging Feature](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/technology/germany-investigates-facebook-tagging.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss). Unless there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBulterian Jihad‚Äù the transparent society is inevitable.

[Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Animal Enhancement as a Tool of Liberation](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2011/08/03/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-animal-enhancement-as-a-tool-of-liberation/). Remember the [Uplift Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_Universe)?

[Are Smart People Getting Smarter?](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/are-smart-people-getting-smarter/). Alas, I don‚Äôt see it in the comments of this weblog enough üôÇ

[CpG Islands Undermethylation in Human Genomic Regions under Selective Pressure](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023156?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FEvolutionaryBiology+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Evolutionary+Biology%29). Wheels within wheels.

[On the wealth gap](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2011/08/on-wealth-gap.html). Difference between mean and median between blacks and Hispanics changes the rank order. Interesting.

[Dating Across Ideological Lines](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/273378/dating-across-ideological-lines-reihan-salam#). I recall that Tyler Cowen once mentioned how libertarians tend to date liberals and not conventional conservatives.

[Genetic Differences Distinguish Stomach Cancers, Treatment Response](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110801160150.htm?). Not the differences you‚Äôd expect.

[Private companies own your DNA ‚Äì again](http://blogs.forbes.com/stevensalzberg/2011/07/31/private-companies-own-your-dna-again/). I‚Äôm not going to make a crack about lawyers. But I want to‚Ä¶..

[Some Exercise Is Better Than None: More Is Better to Reduce Heart Disease Risk](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110801161414.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). Duh.

[Monkey See, Monkey Do? The Role of Mirror Neurons in Human Behavior](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110801120355.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). So are mirror neurons all that?

[Race and Personalized Medicine](http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/01/race-and-personalized-medicine). First, kill all the sociologists.

[Decline and fall of the American empire](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/06/us-economy-decline-recovery-challenges). You don‚Äôt need to be an imperial citizen to flourish.

[The End of the Kemalist Affair](http://www.slate.com/id/2300537/). You can‚Äôt drag a whole nation into another civilization against its will.

[A 33,000-Year-Old Incipient Dog from the Altai Mountains of Siberia: Evidence of the Earliest Domestication Disrupted by the Last Glacial Maximum](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022821?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FEvolutionaryBiology+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Evolutionary+Biology%29). I find multiple domestication events plausible. Wolves are ideally suited to co-adapting with humans.

[Free sterilisation](http://www.jasoncollins.org/2011/07/free-sterilisation/). The main issue is that lots of young people who think they don‚Äôt want kids at 25 do at 35. So make sure it‚Äôs reversible.

[Can Microsoft Make You ‚ÄòBing‚Äô?](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/technology/with-the-bing-search-engine-microsoft-plays-the-underdog.html) Large corporations can squeeze efficiencies on the margin, but Bing is still copying Google‚Äôs suggestions. Kind of pathetic.

[Hideki Irabu, Briefly a Yankee Sensation, Dies at 42](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/sports/baseball/ex-yankee-hideki-irabu-is-dead-at-42.html?partner=rss&emc=rss).

[Should Religion Play a Role in Politics?](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/should-religion-play-a-role-in-politics/) This is like asking ‚Äúshould men have sex with women?‚Äù It‚Äôs always going to happen. The question isn‚Äôt *is*, but the specific nature of how it plays out.

[The impact of Converso Jews on the genomes of modern Latin Americans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789512#). I was going to blog this, but I didn‚Äôt understand one of the figures at all.

[Real wealth](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/07/real-wealth.html). History is returning to type in some ways. How about [others](http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/Thomas.Jefferson.Quote.EFEC)?

[Ancient Arab Medicine Goes Online](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/arab-medicine-goes-digital/). Yes, but how about modern Arab medicine?

[Hitting The Wall At 114 Years Old](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/008204.html). Proof that the Bible is not literally true?

[Population-genetic comparison of the Sorbian isolate population in Germany with the German KORA population using genome-wide SNP arrays](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/67).

[Zinc Lozenges May Shorten Common Cold Duration, Finnish Research Suggests](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110726092948.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). The positive and negative results in the area of mitigating cold symptoms is kind of lame, and tells us how much a lot of medicine is pushing on the margin of diminishing returns.

[GOP Making Strong Party ID Gains Among Whites](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/07/22/276773/gop-making-strong-party-id-gains-among-whites/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29).
