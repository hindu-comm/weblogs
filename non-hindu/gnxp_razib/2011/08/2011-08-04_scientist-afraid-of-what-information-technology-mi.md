Scientist afraid of what information technology might do to our brains

[Carl](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom) pointed me to this really strange interview in *New Scientist*, [Susan Greenfield: Living online is changing our brains](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128236.400-susan-greenfield-living-online-is-changing-our-brains.html). If you removed it from the *New Scientist* website and put it on the *The Onion* it wouldn’t really need much editing. Some of the things Susan Greenfield says make you scratch your head. First paragraph:

> **You think that digital technology is having an impact on our brains. > How do you respond to those who say there’s no evidence for this?** >
> When people say there is no evidence, you can turn that back and say, > what kind of evidence would you imagine there would be? Are we going > to have to wait for 20 years and see that people are different from > previous generations? Sometimes you can’t just go into a lab and get > the evidence overnight. I think there are enough pointers that we > should be talking about this rather than stressing about not being > able to replicate things in a lab instantly.

Happy-slapping? Seriously? That was *so* [mid-2000s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_slapping#History). It’s going to be really hard to escape the oncoming rush of the “wall of information” in the near future. If it drives our world insane, there are always the residents of [North Sentinel Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sentinel_Island).
