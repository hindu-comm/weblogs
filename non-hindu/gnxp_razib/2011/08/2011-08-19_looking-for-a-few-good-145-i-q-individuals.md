Looking for a few good 145+ I.Q. individuals

**Cross-posted from [Discover](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/looking-for-a-few-good-145-i-q-individuals/)**

My friend Steve Hsu gave a [talk at Google today](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/08/google-genetics-and-intelligence.html). Here are the details:

From what I recall of my discussion with Steve the aim here is to fish in the extreme tail of the distribution to see if that allows for an easier catchment of I.Q. upward incrementing alleles. 3 standard deviations above the mean I.Q. is about 1 out of 750 individuals or so.
