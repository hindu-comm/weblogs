Friday Fluff – August 5th, 2011

1\) **Post from the past:** [Genetics is One: Mendelism and quantitative traits](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/genetics-is-one-mendelism-and-quantitative-traits/)

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “brad pitt look alike.”

3\) Please note that I don’t endorse the views of the “comment of the week”! **Comment of the week**, in response to [“1 in 3 Iranian men ‘gay’?”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/1-out-of-3-young-iranian-men-gay/#comment-80762):

> I think you are a bunch of idiots trying to judge everything with your nonsensical mindset. >
> I am a man and have fucked boys in Iran when I was at high school. > They were supposedly gay and we used to call them sissy boys. So, will > that make me gay? No! I did that because girls were not accessible. Also at a younger age \`fucking somebody’ meant \`proving your superiority’. Even now, I would happily fuck you mf\* to show who has the upper hand! >
> But this sort of affairs would mostly happen between bullies and > sissies. The rest 90% of children were immune of such activities. > Those of us who did such things a couple of times also gave up doing > so as we became more mature. I think you are out of your mind if you think 30% of men are gay or those unmarried are involved with other men!! You come up with such ideas only because your fucked-up society is so obsessed with gays, gayness, gay rights, etc. >
> As Ahmadinejad said, “we don’t have gays in Iran”! But we are happy to export our sissy boys to your fucked-up societies, as I am sure you will enjoy their company, since you new-generation nerdish westerners have turned gays yourselves.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
