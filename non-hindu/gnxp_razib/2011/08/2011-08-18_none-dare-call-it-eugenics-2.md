None dare call it eugenics

This is a common response to some of the things mooted on this weblog. [Freddie deBoer](https://lhote.blogspot.com/) even sent me a peculiar email last year expressing how appalled he was at some of the topics and comments in these parts (if you know Freddie’s internet reputation, this is not surprising behavior). First, I don’t know what people mean by “eugenics.” Here is the first sentence in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics) for the eugenics entry:

> Eugenics is the “applied science or the bio-social movement which > advocates the use of practices aimed at improving the genetic > composition of a population”, usually referring to human populations….

Wikipedia isn’t authoritative, and colloquial definitions can deviate from “official” definitions. As a rule I don’t generally talk much about state coercion or manipulation of the reproduction of the citizenry, so I don’t see that I’m talking about classical eugenics. **But, it does seem that there are eugenical implications in the *mass action* of human behavior and the flexibility of choices which modern humans have.** Consider this [long article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=print) in *The New York Times Magazine*, [The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=print):

I think it’s kind of silly to get worried about the long term impact of assortative mating when biotech and reproductive intervention is such a banal part of the existence of many people alive today. As many couples delay having children into their late 30s more and more regular people naturally begin to think in a eugenical manner **on a personal and individual level.** The state is not driving any of this, and neither is society (in fact, many of the couples above who opt for reduction of twins to singletons keep that decision to themselves for fear of social ostracism). Consider this fragment of the above article: “A. and her partner **had been together 15 years** when they decided to get serious about having children. **Because both women were 45….**” Two women who waited 15 years and are now 45 are going to view the “rational” calculus of having children very differently from a couple in their mid-20s.
