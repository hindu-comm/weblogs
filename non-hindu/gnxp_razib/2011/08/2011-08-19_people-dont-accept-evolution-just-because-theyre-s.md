People don't accept evolution just because they're smart

Well, here’s a logistic regression from the GSS:

Don’t take it too seriously. A lot of these are categorical variables which happen to be rank ordered (e.g., most liberal = 1 and most conservative = 7). But as you can see the WORDSUM correlation disappears when you throw in other variables. In fact, even education isn’t statistically significant anymore. That seems ludicrous, but remember that **Biblical literalism is strongly correlated with lower levels of education and intelligence.** Once you throw that in there as an explanatory variable it sucks up all the oxygen.
