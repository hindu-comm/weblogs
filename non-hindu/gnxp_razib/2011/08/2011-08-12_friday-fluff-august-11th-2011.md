1\) **Post from the past:** [Dwarfism and cell division](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/01/dwarfism-and-cell-division.php).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “is it legal to marry your third cousin.”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [Pleasure through signalling](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/pleasure-through-signalling/):

> Once at a farmer’s market I bought a couple little things that looked like habaneros. The guy who sold them to me looked at me like I was insane which I should have taken as a clue. >
> I chopped them up and through them in a salsa and the effect was –it > wasn’t like a normal spiciness in any way. It was more like nerve gas. > I was overcome with a sort of intense nausea and vertigo and violent ‘steaming’ sensation through my whole body. It was like I could feel areas of the surface of my skin violently spewing out some kind of gas like out of a steam vent. >
> Also it was really spicy and fried every part of my GI tract during it’s ten minute journey. (like Charlie Sheen on a bender in my bowels). >
> Anyone else ever run into this weird pepper?

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
