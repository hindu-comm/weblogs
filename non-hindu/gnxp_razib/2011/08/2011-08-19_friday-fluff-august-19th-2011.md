Friday Fluff – August 19th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) **Post from the past:** [The arc of evolutionary genetics is long](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/10/the-arc-of-evolutionary-genetics-is-long/).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “sandra laing genetics.” This was actually the \#1 query the past week. That’s the strange part, as Sandra Laing isn’t in the news right now from what I can tell.

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [None dare call it eugenics](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/08/none-dare-call-it-eugenics-2/#comment-82093), two comments:

> 6\. [\[emailprotected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) Says: >
> Throwing around the term “Eugenics” is akin to the internet tactic of > invoking the Nazis. Without talking specifics, it’s just an attempt to > smear by associating the mundane aspects with the horrific. For > instance, nearly anything that’s authoritarian has been called “fascist” … why not just use authoritarian? Do we need to hang death camps and the final solution on anything that is remotely governmental? >
> People make little e eugenic decisions when they mate select. They > also espouse eugenics in a passive manner when they follow fashions, > idolize models and athletes, etc. Heck, they defraud the eugenic > assumptions when they get cosmetic surgery, apply copious amounts of > makeup, get hair plugs, and even work out excessively using supplements and drugs. If you desire to present a false image of your genetic quality, you’re also buying into the notion that having “good” genes is superior and important. >
> Anyone who suggests that it’s a slippery slope from eye-liner to forced sterilizations is an idiot. >
> 7\. Jason Says: >
> I think the big danger of eugenics or racism is that it is a very slippery slope and so should not be joked about.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
