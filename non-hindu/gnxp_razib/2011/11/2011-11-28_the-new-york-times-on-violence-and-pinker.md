The New York Times on violence and Pinker

[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/science/human-natures-pathologist.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print) has a [short piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/science/human-natures-pathologist.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print) on Steven Pinker up. Nothing too new to long time followers of the man and his work. I would like to point readers to the fact that Steven Pinker has a [F.A.Q.](http://stevenpinker.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions-about-better-angels-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined)up for [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670022950/geneexpressio-20). He links to my post,[Relative angels and absolute demons](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/10/relative-angels-and-absolute-demons/), as supporting his dismissal of Elizabeth Kolbert’s review in *The New Yorker*. I have to admit that I find much, [though not all](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer), of the coverage of science in *The New Yorker* to exhibit some of the more annoying stereotypical caricatures of humanists when confronting the specter of natural philosophy.

I should also mention I started reading[The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670022950/geneexpressio-20)over Thanksgiving. I’m only \~20% through it, and probably won’t finish until Christmas season gets into high gear, but so far it’s a huge mess. In both a good way, and a bad way. The good way is that it’s incredibly rich in its bibliography, with fascinating facts strewn about the path of the narrative. The bad way is that so far it lacks the tightness of
[The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/geneexpressio-20)or[The Language Instinct](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060958332/geneexpressio-20)in terms of argument. This may change. Finally, I think I should mention that Pinker has already addressed some of the criticisms of his methodologies brought up in the comments sections of my posts. Those who have specific critiques probably should read the book, because he seems to try sincerely to address those. Or at least they should address those critiques to people who have bothered to read the book.
