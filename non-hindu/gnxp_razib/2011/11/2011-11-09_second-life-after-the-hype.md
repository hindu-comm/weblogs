Second Life after the hype

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/secondlife.png?resize=595%2C221)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/secondlife.png?resize=595%2C221)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/secondlife.png)

*Slate* has an interesting retrospective on why [Second Life never fulfilled the hype](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/11/why_second_life_failed_how_the_milkshake_test_helps_predict_which_ultra_hyped_technology_will_succeed_and_which_won_t_.html). My own caution was rooted in an argument from a tech journalist who pointed out that the **exact same things stated about Second Life were once stated about [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD).** He actually simply repeated quotes from stories in the early to mid-1990s and compared them to those in 2006 to illustrate how the same passages were being recycled again. He knew about the power of the hype, because he participated in the first wave before it faded. Of course Second Life was much more sophisticated than any MUD,but it struck me that when the same reasoning is applied to a more perfected version of the phenomenon the same outcome may ensue.

In other news, Facebook’s plateau continues….
