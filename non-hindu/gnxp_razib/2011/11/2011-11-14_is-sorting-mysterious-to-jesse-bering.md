Is sorting mysterious to Jesse Bering?

In a [rambling column](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2011/11/atheist_marriages_should_one_nonbeliever_marry_another_.html) at *Slate* on (ir)religious intermarriage Jesse Berring observes:

> Still, I concede that the irreducible alchemy of romance makes my cold > logic rather difficult to apply to individual marriages. There are > more things to a person—and to a relationship, one hopes—than > religious beliefs. But since atheistic bachelors and bachelorettes are > very rare specimens (there are no exact statistics available, **but just 1.6 percent of the U.S. population self-identifies as “atheist”**), deciding just how important it is to find a godless mate is indeed a real issue.

There are two small issues, and a big one. First, the 1.6 percent figure is a low one because the term “atheist” is somewhat taboo. Atheist as defined by those who don’t believe in God (as opposed to those who admit to being atheists) is closer to [5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States#Demographics). Second, the main issue with “atheist dating” is the [sex ratio problem](http://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=facpub), though that’s more modest in younger age cohorts today than older ones.

But the broader point is that **it’s totally ridiculous to assume that mating is random within the population.** Jews are \~3% of the American population, but Jewish-Jewish pairings are not 0.03 × 0.03. I’m sure Bering saw that “religious nones” (of which 1/3 are de facto atheists) have a 50% probability of being with someone of the same lack of beliefs, despite being 15% of the population.

Overall I think it’s right that people should align reasonably well on big metaphysical questions for increased probability of amity. If possible. I don’t think metaphysics (or lack thereof) really matters much day to day, but it does start to matter when there’s a discordance. I just don’t get why Bering ends up writing stuff that’s plainly meant to provoke when there are serious and interesting questions which he is really addressing.
