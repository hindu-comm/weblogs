The power of false positives in behavior genetics

[Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php), [Size matters, and other lessons from medical genetics](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php):

An easy thing to pick on is the reliance on “p-values,” thresholds of statistical significance. Just because something is *statistically significant* doesn’t mean that it is substance. Statistical significance is just a number, and blindly adhering to a numerical standard in most human endeavors often results in a creeping bias and “gaming” of the measurement. There’s going to be a random distribution of p-values, and for publication you just need to fish in the pool below the 0.05 threshold. It just goes to show that you can’t beat taking a step back, and actually thinking about what your results mean and how you came to them.

(as indicated in the post, **this is a problem in many domains,** probably most worryingly in medical and pharmaceutical studies)
