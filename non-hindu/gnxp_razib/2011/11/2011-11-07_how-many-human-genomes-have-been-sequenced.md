How many human genomes have been sequenced?

That query doesn’t seem to have an easy answer on Google, so I’m trying to enter it here. A prominent genomicist asserted a ballpark figure of \~30,000 human genomes in the year 2011. Most of that is in the year 2011 itself. Also, in regards to the “\$1,000 genome” question, it seems that some labs can get \$4,000 dollar human genomes if they buy in bulk (50 at a time). The price point can even go lower apparently, though no number was divulged. This isn’t going to be the “retail” price point obviously, but we’re probably *at most* an order of magnitude away from the \$1,000 genome as of now. We were also told of the likelihood of the \$100 genome, in today’s dollars, in 2020.
