The problem of false positives

[False-positive psychology: undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006061):

> In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite > empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of > false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, > analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive > rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find > evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it > does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual > experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate > (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false > hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and > straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. > The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four > guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the > publication process.

Since the paper is behind a paywall, I’ve cut & pasted the solutions belows:

> We propose the following six requirements for authors. >
> 1.  **Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection >     before data collection begins and report this rule in the >     article.**Following this requirement may mean reporting the >     outcome of power calculations or disclosing arbitrary rules, such >     as “we decided to collect 100 observations” or “we decided to >     collect as many observations as we could before the end of the >     semester.” The rule itself is secondary, but it must be determined >     ex ante and be reported. >
> 2.  **Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else >     provide a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification.**This >     requirement offers extra protection for the first requirement. >     Samples smaller than 20 per cell are simply not powerful enough to >     detect most effects, and so there is usually no good reason to >     decide in advance to collect such a small number of observations. >     Smaller samples, it follows, are much more likely to reflect >     interim data analysis and a flexible termination rule. In >     addition, as[Figure >     1](https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/content/22/11/,DanaInfo=pss.sagepub.com+1359.full#F1)shows, >     larger minimum sample sizes can lessen the impact of violating >     Requirement 1. >
> 3.  **Authors must list all variables collected in a study.**This >     requirement prevents researchers from reporting only a convenient >     subset of the many measures that were collected, allowing readers >     and reviewers to easily identify possible researcher degrees of >     freedom. Because authors are required to just list those variables >     rather than describe them in detail, this requirement increases >     the length of an article by only a few words per otherwise >     shrouded variable. We encourage authors to begin the list with >     “only,” to assure readers that the list is exhaustive (e.g., >     “participants reported only their age and gender”). >
> 4.  **Authors must report all experimental conditions, including >     failed manipulations.**This requirement prevents authors from >     selectively choosing only to report the condition comparisons that >     yield results that are consistent with their hypothesis. As with >     the previous requirement, we encourage authors to include the word >     “only” (e.g., “participants were randomly assigned to one of only >     three conditions”). >
> 5.  **If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what >     the statistical results are if those observations are >     included.**This requirement makes transparent the extent to which >     a finding is reliant on the exclusion of observations, puts >     appropriate pressure on authors to justify the elimination of >     data, and encourages reviewers to explicitly consider whether such >     exclusions are warranted. Correctly interpreting a finding may >     require some data exclusions; this requirement is merely designed >     to draw attention to those results that hinge on ex post decisions >     about which data to exclude. >
> 6.  **If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the >     statistical results of the analysis without the >     covariate.**Reporting covariate-free results makes transparent >     the extent to which a finding is reliant on the presence of a >     covariate, puts appropriate pressure on authors to justify the use >     of the covariate, and encourages reviewers to consider whether >     including it is warranted. Some findings may be persuasive even if >     covariates are required for their detection, but one should place >     greater scrutiny on results that do hinge on covariates despite >     random assignment. >
> ### Guidelines for reviewers >
> We propose the following four guidelines for reviewers. >
> 1.  **Reviewers should ensure that authors follow the >     requirements.**Review teams are the gatekeepers of the scientific >     community, and they should encourage authors not only to rule out >     alternative explanations, but also to more convincingly >     demonstrate that their findings are not due to chance alone. This >     means prioritizing transparency over tidiness; if a wonderful >     study is partially marred by a peculiar exclusion or an >     inconsistent condition, those imperfections should be retained. If >     reviewers require authors to follow these requirements, they will. >
> 2.  **Reviewers should be more tolerant of imperfections in >     results.**One reason researchers exploit researcher degrees of >     freedom is the unreasonable expectation we often impose as >     reviewers for every data pattern to be (significantly) as >     predicted. Underpowered studies with perfect results are the ones >     that should invite extra scrutiny. >
> 3.  **Reviewers should require authors to demonstrate that their >     results do not hinge on arbitrary analytic decisions.**Even if >     authors follow all of our guidelines, they will necessarily still >     face arbitrary decisions. For example, should they subtract the >     baseline measure of the dependent variable from the final result >     or should they use the baseline measure as a covariate? When there >     is no obviously correct way to answer questions like this, the >     reviewer should ask for alternatives. For example, reviewer >     reports might include questions such as, “Do the results also hold >     if the baseline measure is instead used as a covariate?” >     Similarly, reviewers should ensure that arbitrary decisions are >     used consistently across studies (e.g., “Do the results hold for >     Study 3 if gender is entered as a covariate, as was done in Study >     2?”).^([5](https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/content/22/11/,DanaInfo=pss.sagepub.com+1359.full#fn-7))If >     a result holds only for one arbitrary specification, then everyone >     involved has learned a great deal about the robustness (or lack >     thereof) of the effect. >
> 4.  **If justifications of data collection or analysis are not >     compelling, reviewers should require the authors to conduct an >     exact replication.**If a reviewer is not persuaded by the >     justifications for a given researcher degree of freedom or the >     results from a robustness check, the reviewer should ask the >     author to conduct an exact replication of the study and its >     analysis. We realize that this is a costly solution, and it should >     be used selectively; however, “never” is too selective.

To preempt angry and offended psychology professors: **this problem is not limited to their discipline.** It is probably a bigger problem in medicine because it costs us a lot of money and likely kills people.
