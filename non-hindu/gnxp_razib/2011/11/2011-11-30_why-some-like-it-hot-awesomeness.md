Why some like it hot: awesomeness

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/356px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg?resize=174%2C293)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/356px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg?resize=174%2C293)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/356px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg)Mr. [Jason Goldman](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2011/11/30/on-capsaicin-why-do-we-eat-love-hot-peppers/) has a post up, [On Capsaicin: Why Do We Love to Eat Hot Peppers?](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2011/11/30/on-capsaicin-why-do-we-eat-love-hot-peppers/). We don’t need no stinkin’ science for this. Do some ethnography with an N = 1: me. Those of us who love spicy food are just awesome! Recently I went to a Thai restaurant for the first time in 4 years which I used to frequent weekly in 2006-2007. Every Saturday I’d go and get a [beef salad](http://www.food.com/recipe/tiger-cries-salad-a-spicy-thai-beef-salad-89570), which the chef would specially prepare for me by rubbing in a habanero paste into the meat ahead of time. That was the “four star” spicy level. When I reappeared after all this time the host exclaimed, “It’s Mr. four star!” Despite the years much of the staff which had been around back then remembered me. Back in the day sometimes they’d even watch me eat the dish to observe if I’d live to tell the tale. I can tell you similar stories from other restaurants. My very high spice tolerance threshold has reached such a level of virtuosity that people are often taken aback, and strangers will often comment upon it.

My point is that consumption of spicy food isn’t just a experience of the palette, it is deeply social. It is a signal of awesomeness, like having big antlers.

Here are some of Jason’s ideas:

> Perhaps we seek out the painful experience of snacking on chillies > while consciously maintaining awareness that there is no real danger > to ourselves. After all, people seem to enjoy – and actively seek out > – many other sensations that are otherwise undesirable but are > ostensibly safe: the sensation of falling provided by rollercoasters > or skydiving, the feelings of fear and anxiety while watching horror > movies, the physical pain experienced upon jumping into icy water, or > even the feelings of sadness that come while watching a tear-jerker. > Perhaps it is this cognitive mismatch itself that provides the thrill: like strapping into a rollercoaster or popping Hostel into your DVD player over and over again, the burn of capsaicin only seems to be threatening.
