Tolerable jackfruit

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/220px-Artocarpus_heterophyllus_fruits_at_tree.jpg?resize=220%2C341)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/220px-Artocarpus_heterophyllus_fruits_at_tree.jpg?resize=220%2C341)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/11/220px-Artocarpus_heterophyllus_fruits_at_tree.jpg)When perusing Asian groceries I occasionally run into cans of [jackfruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackfruit). Or should I say “jackfruit,” because often what’s inside of the cans resembles jackfruit flavored wax. Real fresh jackfruit is soft and mushy. Unfortunately the preservation process turns canned jackfruit into a turgid and far less flavorful product. That being said, I recently purchased three different brands, and I found that [Chaokoh](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000JSQ59I/geneexpressio-20) brand wasn’t totally awful. I don’t know if I’d purchase it again, but I am considering it. It’s not real jackfruit by any means, but the flavor is stronger and the waxiness of the fruit flesh less pronounced.

Do readers have any experiences with canned jackfruit?
