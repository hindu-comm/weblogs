What are you reading?

I haven’t had time to read a book front to back in 2 months. Probably the longest period I’ve gone like this since I was 13. I plan to “binge” as much as I can over the Holidays. Is there anything interesting you’re reading? And yes, I already have [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670022950/geneexpressio-20) on my [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0052REUW0/geneexpressio-20).
