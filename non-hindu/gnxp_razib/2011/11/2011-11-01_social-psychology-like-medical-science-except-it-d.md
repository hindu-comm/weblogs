Social psychology: like medical science (except it doesn't kill you)

I was warned off social psychology years ago by a friend (who was a research psychologist) because of the field’s propensity for ‘sexy’ results which get a lot of media play. As a lay person he doubted I could tell the fake from the reliable, the one off from the replicable. Later someone else told me about how dispiriting it was engaging in [data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) to find something publishable in a lab where they were working, even though many of the principals involved obviously assumed that the results weren’t robust. Keep that in mind when you read about the mind-boggling scientific fraud perpetrated by [Diederik Stapel](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/10/report-dutch-lord-of-the-data-fo.html). It looks like he might be the Bernie Madoff of psychology. The Lehman Brothers to the Long Term Capital Management of [Marc Hauser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Hauser). Here’s a taste:

> Stapel’s work encompassed a broad range of attention-catching topics, > including the influence of power on moral thinking and the reaction of > psychologists to a plagiarism scandal. The committee, which > interviewed dozens of Stapel’s former students, postdoctoral > researchers, co-authors, and colleagues, found that Stapel alone was > responsible for the fraud. The panel reported that he would discuss in > detail experimental designs, including drafting questionnaires, and > would then claim to conduct the experiments at high schools and > universities with which he had special arrangements. The experiments, > however, never took place, the universities concluded. Stapel made up > the data sets, which he then gave the student or collaborator for > analysis, investigators allege. In other instances, the report says, > he told colleagues that he had an old data set lying around that he hadn’t yet had a chance to analyze. When Stapel did conduct actual experiments, the committee found evidence that he manipulated the results.

Here’s the controversial thing I’m going to say: **instances of flamboyant fraud are probably far less of an issue in a discipline like social psychology than more subtle biases and systematic incentives.** Similarly, someone like Bernie Madoff was notable for the havoc he caused on an individual level, but he paled in the aggregate against the death by a thousand cuts that occurred as the housing market collapsed under the pall of modest “liar loans” and the like. And this isn’t just a problem with science. ‘Sexy’ social psychological research is routinely blasted by the press, and devoured by the public. Incentives matter, and Diederik Stapel is just the *reductio ad absurdum* of scientists who respond to the repeated 15 minutes of fame which the press provides. Most of the time it’s not so blatant, nor frankly so malicious in consequence. I doubt that there are manyDiederik Stapel’s in the field, else he wouldn’t have gotten so far with bluster and bluff.
