Roman DNA Project funded

Nice. [We’re funded!](http://romandnaproject.org/2011/11/11/were-funded/):

> Thanks to an amazing piece at the[CNN blog Light Years by Ed > Yong](http://lightyears.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/11/who-were-the-99-of-ancient-rome/), > the outpouring of support for the Roman DNA Project today has been > astounding! In financial news, we have actually[exceeded our \$6,000 > goal](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/3709-ancient-roman-dna-project), > after just 10 days. That goal was to fund analysis of at least 20 > individuals (the immigrants to Rome that I found through Sr/O isotope > analysis). Of course, we are accepting donations through > mid-December, **so additional funding will be put to good use – > studying more ancient Romans!** >
> And I’ve received a dozen or more emails today from people as excited > as I am about this project, offering their encouragement, lab > services, expertise, and knowledge about the ancient world. I will > respond to all of them, I promise, but it might take a few days! >
> Again, thank you – all of you reading this – for making this project a > reality!

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/11/doing-science-right.html) has a little extra commentary. In any case, congratulations are in order! This sort of genetic science seems to be “low hanging fruit.” It isn’t as if you need to fund a massive particle accelerator and what not. I hope that all the museums with assorted samples in their back rooms may now consider the possibility that they don’t have to wait for [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Evolutionary_Anthropology) to approach them….
