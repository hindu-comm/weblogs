Friends & genes & heritability

A few people have inquired of the [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/01/07/1011687108) paper [On sharing genes with friends](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/01/07/1011687108). I avoided comment in part because I’m skeptical of the findings. So much behavior genomics just hasn’t panned out over the long term, and is probably susceptible to the issues which fuel the [“decline effect”](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/the-mysterious-decline-effect/). Statistical significance is a random variable too. The fundamental issue which I want to emphasize is this: **many behavioral traits are highly *heritable*, insofar as the correlation between relatives of trait value is in direct proportion to their genetic correlation.** But, just because a trait is heritable does not mean that you can affix the variation to a *specific* set of genes. That is because the character of [genetic architecture](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/the-rise-of-genetic-architecture/) varies, and it may be that for many behavioral traits with some biological basis the causal variants which are responsible for the range in trait values are distributed across *thousands* of genes, and so are of very small effect.

Carl Zimmer [relayed the depth of skepticism in the scientific community yesterday](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/01/18/how-many-people-are-not-everyone-some-thoughts-on-scientific-debates-and-smackdowns/), and today [Dr. Daniel MacArthur reviewed the paper](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/on-sharing-genes-with-friends/). Here are the top line reactions:

More broadly, fixing upon the most recent findings implicating a specific set of **candidate gene(s)**, which only later turn out to be false paths poisons the bigger project of putting in proper perspective the biological component of human behavior. The heritability of many behavioral traits ***is*** is a robust finding. This truth often is unjustifiably put into the same category are “candidate gene for trait X.” When it comes to genetics and behavior there is the unfortunate reality that the stringency of the evidence needed to persuade is extremely conditional on normative preferences. Much of the media is hungry for genes for every ludicrous behavior (I am pretty sure that a fake press release on a “gene for skate boarding” could result in a series of articles all around the world), and, there is a broad acceptance in the public that behavior is substantially heritable. At the other extreme are those who are skeptical for normative reasons of universal tendencies in human behavior, or variation between sexes and groups. The same people who in other areas accept the provisional findings of “soft” sciences became as demanding as the most rigorous physicist when presented within findings which are not congenial to their preferred outcomes. Because of this consistent structural problem one must always tread with care and prudence when it comes to extraordinary claims.
