A 'leaky' model

[John Farrell](http://blogs.forbes.com/johnfarrell/) pointed me to this Anne Gibbons’ [piece](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/392.summary), [A New View Of the Birth of Homo sapiens](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/392.summary). Here’s some interesting passages:

I suppose ‘assimilation’ sounds too generic, but ‘leaky replacement’ seems more fitting for a [building ‘super’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_superintendent). But it isn’t as if paleoanthropology has a [Don Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Draper), a rogue with a way with words.

Here’s the infographic that went along with it:

One issue I’m wondering: **what’s the best mammalian analog for humans?** By humans I mean our lineage since the emergence of *H. erectus* (or whatever they’re calling it now) and its expansion into Eurasia. Off the top of my head, I think the gray wolf is the best candidate:
