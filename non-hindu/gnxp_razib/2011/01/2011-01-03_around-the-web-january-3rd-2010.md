Around the Web – January 3rd, 2010

I don’t do too many New Year’s Resolutions. My main goal this year which is of interest readers is increase total quantity of quality in terms of content. In other words, I want to keep volume up, but increase the quality of posting.

If you haven’t [contributed to the Open Thread this week](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/open-thread-january-1st-2011/), it’s about post requests.

Since [“Scissors” Michelle](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com/2011/01/links-jan-2-2011.html) already nudged the “soft launch” a bit harder, I thought it might be time to introduce [Brown Pundits](http://www.brownpundits.com/). [Zach Latif](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/apr/11/merrilllynch.banking) & were spending too much time talking to each other on the comment boards of [Sepia Mutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/). I thought Zach’s comments would probably benefit from a wider venue, and I am (along with others) coming on board. The topicality is [brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi), but that’s about it. Now, I’m about as brown as a Jewish guy raised in north Alabama who loves ham sandwiches & Christmas tree decorations is Jewish (or, the perhaps the biggest Jain patron of Outback Steakhouse is Jain). But like being Jewish being brown is to some extent [inalienable](http://www.brownpundits.com/2010/12/31/the-union-of-being-brown/), so of course I’ll speak up. Since Zach is a Pakistani Bahai who grew up in Kuwait and Britain whose mother is an ethnic Persian, I think it’s kosher to add him to the “league of odd-brownz.” BP has a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/brownpundits) and a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brown-Pundits/171243176244781).

Speaking of Michelle, [she’s back to blogging more regularly](http://ecophysio.fieldofscience.com/). Wish her well after her less-than-optimal 2010 part 2.

[Amerindian-like sequences in Baltic Finns (aka. phased data and extended haplotypes are the way forward)](https://bga101.blogspot.com/2011/01/amerindian-like-sequences-in-baltic.html). David seems to be suggesting that there are traces of some commonality between Amerindians and Finns not found in other Europeans. First thought would be that this is a common circumpolar element.

  
[A genetic map of West Eurasians](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/01/genetic-map-of-west-eurasians.html). Oh my! Read the whole thing. Note the large gap between Pakistani Iranian speakers, and Farsi speakers. Is this simply a function of geography? Do Tajiks, or Farsi speakers from Khorasan, resemble Pathans more? Or perhaps the Indo-Iranian languages are overlain on preexistent genetic variation?

[What the Roman Empire’s demographics were like and what they mean](https://demographymatters.blogspot.com/2010/12/what-roman-empires-demographics-were.html). ” the only countries that comes close to the likely life expectancy of the average Roman are a long list of terribly poor countries, all but Afghanistan located in sub-Saharan Africa, most with very high levels of HIV infection in addition to any number of other illnesses. But even the worst-off country, Swaziland, comes at 39.6 years at least a decade ahead of the Roman average and on par with the luckiest Roman districts.” And many people in very poor countries today have cell phones!

[World population 500BC](http://www.jasoncollins.org/2011/01/world-population-500bc/). Also see [John Hawks’ comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-axial-age-world-population/#comment-56352).

[American English Dialect Map](http://aschmann.net/AmEng/#SmallMapUnitedStates). A definite time killer!

[Our Brains Are Shrinking. Are We Getting Dumber?](http://www.npr.org/2011/01/02/132591244/our-brains-are-shrinking-are-we-getting-dumber) This one is not behind a paywall.

[A kiss still outperforms a dating website](http://www.statesman.com/opinion/insight/a-kiss-still-outperforms-a-dating-website-1157575.html?page=2&viewAsSinglePage=true). “When choosing a mate, you can’t beat up-close chemistry.”

[Israel’s Fundamentalist Future](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/12/israels-fundamentalist-future). You’ve already encountered this argument here.

[Twins’ Facebook Fight Rages On](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/business/31twins.html). Can’t decide whether it’s irrational greed or irrational pride.

[100 Trillion Connections: New Efforts Probe and Map the Brain’s Detailed](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=100-trillion-connections). That’s an incomprehensible number. Ironic if that’s the root of comprehension.

[How old is Y-chromosome Adam?](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-old-is-y-chromosome-adam.html) Many people, including myself, have been known to treat Y and mtDNA methods of inference as “black boxes.” But now is the time to go back and check our premises.

[Economic Optimism? Yes, I’ll Take That Bet](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/science/28tierney.html). John Tierney won his bet on oil prices by 2010, recapitulating the famous Simon-Ehrlich bet. Can’t believe that Ehrlich won a MacArthur award in the year in he lost the bet!

[Brooklyn Immigrant Congregations Clash](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/nyregion/29church.html). Religion is not always the solution to inter-ethnic clashes.

[Doctors on Facebook Risk Compromising Doctor-Patient Relationship, Study Suggests](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101215193056.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). A lawyer friend commented that if people had to pay medical expenses out of pocket like they often have to do with legal bills, doctors wouldn’t be nearly as a popular. The operation of the AMA as a licensing cartel is hurting the median well being of the average American. Pushing M.D.’s off their pedestal by showing them to be toolish humans on Facebook might be a good thing!

[Rodents Were Diverse and Abundant in Prehistoric Africa When Our Human Ancestors Evolved](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101221101920.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Africa, the mother of the rat?

[From Simple To Complex](http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/57883/). Repeated emergence of multicellularity?

[Artificial intelligence makes some progress, but robots still can’t match humans](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/20/AR2010122004781.html). Check out some books about the future of robotics from th early 1980s. Revealing.

[Was There Any Cannibalism during the “Great Drought”?](http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/was-there-any-cannibalism-during-the-great-drought/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingAnthropologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Anthropology)) A few years ago Martin Gardiner was promoting the idea of some cultural anthropologist that cannibalism was a universal myth.

[Behavioral consequences of dopamine deficiency in the Drosophila central nervous system](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/21/1010930108.short?rss=1).

[Muslim ham complaint thrown out](http://www.theolivepress.es/2010/12/25/ham-complaint-thrown-out/). “A prosecutor has thrown out a complaint made by a Muslim family against a geography teacher who mentioned pork in their son’s class.” Barbarians strike again!

[19 of the Best Infographics From 2010](http://mashable.com/2010/12/27/best-infographics-2010/). A list I want to make in 2011!

[On Genetic Denialism](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2010/12/on_genetic_denialism.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=channellink).

[Europe’s Economic Pain Awakens Old Arguments](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/global/29euro.html).

[Default Position](http://www.slate.com/id/2279397/). “Why we needn’t worry too much about municipal bankruptcy.” Hope it’s so!

[The Year of the Exome](http://www.massgenomics.org/2010/12/the-year-of-the-exome.html). Yes!
