Synthetic associations and all that

[PLoS Biology](http://www.plosbiology.org/home.action) has four items of great interest out today:

–[Synthetic Associations Created by Rare Variants Do Not Explain Most GWAS Results](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000579)  
–[Synthetic Associations Are Unlikely to Account for Many Common Disease Genome-Wide Association Signals](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000580)  
–[The Importance of Synthetic Associations Will Only Be Resolved Empirically](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001008)  
–[Common Disease: Are Causative Alleles Common or Rare?](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001009)

These are a response to last year’s [paper on synthetic associations](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000294) from the Goldstein lab. Here’s a critique of that [that paper](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/01/bold-prediction-synthetic-associations.php). I plan on reviewing the first in the list above soon. \#3 is a response to \#1 and \#2 from David Goldstein, while \#4 is a summation more aimed at the general audience.
