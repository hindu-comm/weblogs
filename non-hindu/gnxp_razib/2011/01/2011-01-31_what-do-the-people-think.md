What do the people think?

With all the geopolitical tumult and news I was a bit curious to see what [The World Values Survey](http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/WVSAnalizeStudy.jsp) could tell us about public opinion in Egypt and Tunisia. Unfortunately, Tunisia hasn’t been in any of their surveys, though Egypt has. So I thought it might be interesting to compare the USA, Sweden, Turkey, Egypt, and Iraq, for wave 5, which occurred in the mid-2000s. The main thing I took away from the exercise is to reflect that Americans are a more equivocal people than I had expected. Many of the questions have a 1 to 10 scale, and I’m providing the most extreme answers. So the low fractions for Americans for some questions point to a relative moderation on some topics…which is kind of weird when you are asking whether “People choosing their leaders is an essential characteristic of democracy.” Since that’s the *definition* of democracy broadly construed anything below a 10 out of 10 seems strange to me.
