Promoting baby-bloggers

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/baby.png?resize=175%2C296)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/baby.png?resize=175%2C296)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/01/baby.png)Today I received an email from an academic with whom I am acquainted about how to get a successful blog going. Obviously the main necessary condition is actually to keep plugging away.Though that’s not sufficient. [Jason Goldman](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2011/01/supporting_new_bloggers.php) has a post up, [In the Wake of Science Online (#scio11): Supporting New Bloggers](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2011/01/supporting_new_bloggers.php). I don’t believe in supporting new bloggers just *because*. They have to be *good*. But assuming that the *goodness* criterion is met, what next? Last spring when I was on vacation I noticed that Jason Goldman retweeted one of my posts on Jewish genetics. I knew Jason’s blog from [ResearchBlogging](http://researchblogging.org/). Additionally, he moved into the [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/) neighborhood just as I moved out. But the topicality of our weblogs are far enough apart that the retweet got my attention.

  
Let’s be frank: **if you’re interested in the material that I write about on this weblog, and there’s not an obvious reason you should be (e.g., your blog is not focused on human evolutionary genetics), I suspect that you are an interesting person as well** (at least to me). I am drawn to open-minded people with broad disciplinary interests. Jason was an easy case. He shot up to prominence relatively quickly, and is affiliated with [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/). Consider the evolutionary linguistics weblog [A Replicated Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/). The content meets the *goodness* criterion, but the subject domain is somewhat at a remove from my own, though they are nice overlaps as well (a general evolutionary frame). James Winters, the puppet-master of that group weblog, has both of the *Gene Expression*‘s on his weblog. That got my attention. It just seems that that sort of thing tickles a reciprocity reflex in me.

Also, another way to get my attention is to leave comments here, and link back to your own weblog. Again, the comments have to be *good*. You have to *be* smart, not *seem* smart. I privilege caveat laden kludgey prose with some substance over slick punchy stylistic snark. Though to be honest, I’m human enough that nearly prurient oversharing probably gets my attention too…I dropped *The Superficial* from my feeds a while back, and that needs itching.
