Open Thread – January 15th, 2011

Interesting review of the history of the term [‘group selection’](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/the-meaning-of-group-selection). After taking a long break and coming back to it I’m almost done with [War in Human Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199236631/geneexpressio-20).
