Beware the hungry judge!

This is a datum which you can dine out on, [The Bias You Didn’t Expect](http://lesswrong.com/lw/58y/the_bias_you_didnt_expect/):

> It turns out that legal realism is totally wrong. It’s not what the > judge had for breakfast. It’s how recently the judge had breakfast. A > a new study (media coverage) on Israeli judges shows that, **when > making parole decisions, they grant about 65% after meal breaks, and almost all the way down to 0% right before breaks and at the end of the day (i.e. as far from the last break as possible).** There’s a relatively linear decline between the two points.
