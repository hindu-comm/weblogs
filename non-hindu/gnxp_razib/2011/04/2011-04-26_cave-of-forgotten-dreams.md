*Horses from Chauvet Cave*

I’m not particularly a fan of Werner Herzog films, but I think I might check out his new documentary on Upper Paleolithic art, [Cave of Forgotten Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams). [Chauvet Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave) in France is the subject of the film, which is in 3-D. In media appearances Herzog has claimed that the cave was sealed for 20,000 years before being discovered in 1994. To maintain its pristine character it is closed to the public, so the filmmakers clearly had to jump a lot of hoops to get their footage. [Cave of Forgotten Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams) isopening in limited release this Friday, but from what I can tell that basically means it is showing at [Lincoln Plaza Cinemas](http://www.moviefone.com/theater/lincoln-plaza-cinemas/740/showtimes?selectedShowDate=2011-04-29) in New York, period. So I’ll have to wait for it when it goes nationwide.
