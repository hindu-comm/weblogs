Open Thread – 4/30/2011

I haven’t had these for a while. Following a request from the new year I’ve been mulling how to write up [Population Structure and Eigenanalysis](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020190) in an intelligible manner to the general readership. Still kind of at an impasse. On a logistical note, my email address is really getting on way too many mailing lists. If you want a prompt response from me [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/razibkhan) might be best, at least until I get overwhelmed by the noise on that service and move on to something else….
