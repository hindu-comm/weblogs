The future of knowledge?

Matt Ridley has a predictable op-ed in the *WSJ* (based on our knowledge of his prior normative frame), [Your Genes in an Envelope? More, Please](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703789104576272940264398586.html#printMode). But the last section is interesting:

> If freedom does not appeal, the clinching argument for allowing > consumers unfiltered access to their own genes is a scientific one. > The only way slight genetic influences on health are going to emerge > is if thousands of people submit their genomes for testing, and the > only way that is going to happen is voluntarily. Academic research > projects cannot promise to create the huge databases that an enthusiastic populace applying to an entrepreneurial testing industry can spawn. **Genetic knowledge, whether the high priests like it or not, is going to be a crowd-sourced phenomenon.**

I think “crowd-sourcing” has limits, but in many areas it will probably be the way of the future **because there is a constraint on the labor hours of scholars.** This was implicit in Joseph Pickrell’s argument in [Why DTC genetic testing is good for research](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/03/why-dtc-genetic-testing-is-good-for-research.php). My post [Resolutions in the Indian genetic layer cake](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/resolutions-in-the-indian-genetic-layer-cake/) was based on Zack Ajmal’s particular interest in Indian genetics which prompted him to ask for *both* the [Reich et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/abs/nature08365.html) and [Chauby et al.](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/10/26/molbev.msq288.short?rss=1) data sets. Bringing the two data sets into one ADMIXTURE run easily allowed for the resolution of a major question about the prehistory of South Asia. There’s was nothing preventing scholars from doing this first, but they are busy people and have a finite number of labor hours that they can devote to the sea of questions which are begging to be answered.
