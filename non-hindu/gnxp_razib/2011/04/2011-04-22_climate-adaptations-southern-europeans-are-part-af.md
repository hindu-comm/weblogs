Climate adaptations & Southern Europeans are part African

No time to blog them now…I’ll get to it. But I really want to point you to two papers of interest in PLoS Genetics (all the good stuff lands on Friday!).

[Adaptations to Climate-Mediated Selective Pressures in Humans](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1001375?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosgenetics%2FNewArticles+%28Ambra+-+Genetics+New+Articles%29):

Climate would be “Court Jester”, while immune/disease might be “Red Queen” (unless we’re talking relaxation of constraint). Second, [The History of African Gene Flow into Southern Europeans, Levantines, and Jews](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1001373?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosgenetics%2FNewArticles+%28Ambra+-+Genetics+New+Articles%29):

Some of the genome bloggers have found similar evidence, though more suggestive and not within a rigorous analytic framework. I have a Jewish friend whose genotype I’m running in ADMIXTURE. In lots of runs there is a small African component which I assumed was a false positive. I am curious to look at that again….
