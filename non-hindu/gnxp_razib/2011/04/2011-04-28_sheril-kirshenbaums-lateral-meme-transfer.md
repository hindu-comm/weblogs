Sheril Kirshenbaum's lateral meme transfer

My friend [Sheril Kirshenbaum](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/04/28/parting-ways-at-the-intersection/) at [The Intersection](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection) is going [solo](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs) and joining the crew at [Wired Science Blogs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs). Since I have [other](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/geneticfuture) [friends](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/neuronculture) [there](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/frontal-cortex) the RSS addition will be natural. They better take care of her there. I know from first hand experience that the editors in these digs pay attention to the needs of the bloggers. In any case, Sheril has been someone with whom I’ve had extremely positive interactions with every since we shared space on [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/), so I’m definitely excited for her and will keep an eye on what she’s up to. [You should too](https://twitter.com/#%21/Sheril_)!
