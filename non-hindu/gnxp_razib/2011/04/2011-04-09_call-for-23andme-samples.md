Call for 23andMe samples!

From [Genome Blogger Diogenes](https://dioegenesartemis.blogspot.com/2011/04/call-for-samples.html). Here’s the details:

> I’m very interested in samples from Europe, like Ireland (particularly > the Western part), UK (all, but more Cornwall, Wales, Scotland > Highlands), Finland, Scandinavia (especially Norway), Iceland, > Switzerland, Austria (especially Tirol), Slovakia, Carpathians in > general (regions of Romania, Poland, etc), Germany, Ukraine, Iberia > and France (especially Alps, Massif Central, Pyrenees) with regional > identification. Plus people from the Americas with significant known > Amerindian ancestry (tribe or regional-tagged please). Also any > mountain or island region in the world not represented in my current > sample. I know I’m naming several regions with few participants in > other projects. So I’m not even mentioning Madagascar, Sami, > Indonesia, or Australian samples with known or possible aboriginal > origin.

I need to do a post rounding up a list of Genome Bloggers and also pointers to data sources soon. Also, in case you haven’t kept track of it, [Zack Ajmal](http://www.harappadna.org/2011/04/pan-asian-dataset-duplicates-and-relatives/) has been pruning problematic individuals from the various data sets he’s been collecting (e.g., duplicates, very close relatives, etc.).
