A call to genome bloggers!

A commenter [asks below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/call-for-23andme-samples/comment-page-1/#comment-63873):

> Do you know of any of the genome bloggers working on SE Asia?

Alas, I do not! Why not? I put up the [ADMIXTURE tutorial](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/analyzing-ancestry-with-admixture-step-by-step/) in hopes that it would motivate more people. [Zack](http://www.harappadna.org/) is focusing on South Asia, [Dienekes on the Balkans and West Asia](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/), and [David](https://bga101.blogspot.com/) on northern Eurasia (though naturally they spread their interest further than that). Some of you did not see [my update](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/04/IMPORTANTFIGURE1.jpg) about the post on the [Milesian Project](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/04/my-goodness-my-guinea-ness/). Why isn’t there a Milesian Project?

Academic scientists will come up with more powerful analytic techniques, and grab the high fruit which requires big metal/lots of parallel processing or hard-to-get-data. But there’s a lot people could already do if they are curious and have some computer time on their hands. I know that readers of this weblog have a great number of questions at the intersection of genetics and population history. **You can answer some of them yourself!** And then post them on the internet for me to link up….
