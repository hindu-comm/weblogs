And now a [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/nyregion/kiryas-joel-a-village-with-the-numbers-not-the-image-of-the-poorest-place.html?ref=nyregion&pagewanted=print) article about the community, [A Village With the Numbers, Not the Image, of the Poorest Place](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/nyregion/kiryas-joel-a-village-with-the-numbers-not-the-image-of-the-poorest-place.html?ref=nyregion&pagewanted=print):

> “It is, in a sense, a statistical anomaly,” Professor Helmreich said. > “They are clearly not wealthy, and they do have a lot of children. **They spend whatever discretionary income they have on clothing, food and baby carriages.** They don’t belong to country clubs or go to movies or go on trips to Aruba.

This is the human past, and perhaps the human future. Gains in productivity and wealth are translated into raw human numbers.

No fear, just hope of the promise to come. They will be the inheritors. They are rich in the possibilities of *future*.
