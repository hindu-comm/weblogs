Language and serial founder effects

Mr. James Winters has finally offered his take on [Phonemic diversity supports a serial founder effect model of language expansion from Africa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21493858). [The Return of the Phoneme Inventories](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/science/the-return-of-the-phoneme-inventories/3473/):

Again, I can’t speak to the linguistics. **But overall I believe that *cultural* evolution has more freedom in terms of the dynamics of transmission, and so is *less* likely to be captured by an exceedingly general model.** In other words I think the space of possibilities of plausible models for the patterns we see in population genetics is smaller than the space of possibilities of plausible models for the patterns we see in linguistic diversity, mostly because the transmission of culture is much more plastic, flexible, and rapid in action.
