When the doctor is a patient….

So I’ve been seeing headlines like this today: [Physicians Recommend Different Treatments for Patients Than They Choose for Themselves, Study Finds](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110411163904.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29). Here are the numbers:

> A total of 242 physicians returned the colon cancer questionnaire > (response rate of 48.4 percent), and when asked to imagine they had > received the cancer diagnosis, 37.8 percent of physicians chose the > surgical procedure with a higher rate of death, but a lower rate of > adverse effects. Conversely, when asked to make a recommendation for a > patient, only 24.5 percent of physicians chose this option. >
> The second scenario asked 1,600 physicians to imagine that a new > strain of avian influenza had just arrived in the U.S. One group of > physicians were asked to imagine they had been infected, and the other > group was asked to imagine that his or her patient was infected.

I actually would have thought that the differences would have been stronger than they ended up being. My needle of trust in physician objectivity just went up! Though perhaps my expectation was a little too pessimistic.
