Make your voice heard on genetic testing

Over the past few days some friends have started receiving their results from [23andMe’s](https://www.23andme.com/) last sale (others have put me on notice to inform them of the next discount window). This brings me to thinking about direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and the legal and technological framework in which we live. In relation to the former thanks to Daniel Vorhaus [the F.D.A. has reopened the public docket](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2011/03/31/the-fda-and-dtc-time-to-set-the-record-straight/) on this issue, **until May 2nd.** So Monday. **The best way to submit is online**:[http://www.regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/),and reference docket **ID FDA-2011-N-0066**. I believe this [direct link to the submission page should work as well](https://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=FDA-2011-N-0066-0017). You obviously know my opinion. Here are some [sample](https://dnalawyer.blogspot.com/2011/04/my-public-comments-to-fda.html) [submissions](https://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2011/04/how-and-why-fda-should-allow-dtc.html). You can also see the submissions so far at this [address](https://www.regulations.gov/#!searchResults;rpp=10;po=0;s=+FDA-2011-N-0066). Some of them are quite succinct: “FDA let people access their genetic information since it’s one of basic right of human being.”

[Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/geneticfuture/) has more sage commentary, as usual.

Have a good weekend!
