![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [Personality variation by region (USA)](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/09/personality-variation-by-region-usa.php).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “why are ligers so big?”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“AIBioTech Sports X Factor is not worth the money”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/05/aibiotech-sports-x-factor-is-not-worth-the-money/#comment-72789):

> As you say, transparency is the key – without that the market has a > more difficult job of deciding whether it is valid or not. However > they do list the genes and since many of the effects are based on > single studies (with small numbers), it is safe to say that it is: >
> a\) valid if you are prepared to live with a high “might be right” > factor >
> b\) valid if you think that a single study on men over 70 years old > has some relevance for your children >
> c\) not valid if you prefer to have the interpretations actually > repeated in separate studies so that they are less likely to be based > on chance >
> They say: GROUNDBREAKING PERFORMANCE Tests based upon the newly > developed Reynolds Score >
> So what is this Reynolds Score exactly. the test is based on it so it > must be important, is it worh \$180. Would you buy a \$180 phone based > on “Reynolds OS” without seeing it? The only Reynols Score I can find > does not seem relevant: http://www.reynoldsriskscore.org/home.aspx >
> I’m certainly not against selling genetic tests, I’ve developed quite > a few, I expect transparency though.  
> BTW – This is a good starting point for decigind on validity: > http://www.trustortrash.org/  
> Try it and see if the Sports X Factor passes the test

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
