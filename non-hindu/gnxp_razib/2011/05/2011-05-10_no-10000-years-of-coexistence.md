No 10,000 years of coexistence?

When the [draft sequence of the Neandertal genome](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full) was analyzed it turned out that there was little difference across non-Africans in their proportion of admixture from this other human lineage. It was a rather strange finding as Neandertals seem to have flourished from Europe to the Altai, and from the ice sheets to the fringes of the Middle East. If Papuans had Neandertal admixture the logical conclusion was that that had to occur in the Middle East. Additionally, if Europeans didn’t have much more Neandertal admixture than Papuans, that means that after the initial absorption the modern humans simply swept the field as they pushed north and west.

But there’s a little problem here: **the archeology indicates that Neandertals survived for nearly ten thousand years in Europe after the first arrival of moderns.** So the necessary conclusion granting all the above is that after the initial hybridization some barrier prevented further leakage of Neandertal genes into Europeans (or, perhaps modern Europeans descend from recently arrived Middle Eastern farmers who lack the full Neandertal complement of Paleolithic Europeans?).

A new paper in *PNAS* overturns these paradoxes by re-dating the last Neandertals, allowing them to melt away rather quickly \~40,000 years B.P., just as modern humans were sweeping across Eurasia. [Revised age of late Neanderthal occupation and the end of the Middle Paleolithic in the northern Caucasus](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/05/02/1018938108.short?rss=1):

Nick Wade [gets some quotes from the principals](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/science/10neanderthal.html?pagewanted=print) in *The New York Times*. I found this part amusing though:

> Richard Klein, a paleoanthropologist at Stanford University, said Dr. > Higham’s re-dating was “compelling” and fit with his own view that > “modern humans were technologically and intellectually far superior to > the Neanderthals.” This, he said, “would have allowed them to spread > very rapidly and to precipitate the extinction of the Neanderthals > almost immediately on contact.”

Klein *would* think so, he edited the paper in *PNAS*!
