Edge question 2011

It is the annual *Edge* “question.” This year, [“What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody’s Cognitive Toolkit”?](http://edge.org/annual-question) It looks like [*Edge*](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/) finally updated their design a touch! (happy [Chad](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/)?) Nothing too fancy, which is probably a good thing. I haven’t read all the answers, but I would submit that everyone needs to digest John Ioannidis’ insight, [Why Most Published Research Findings Are False](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/?tool=pmcentrez):

> There is increasing concern that most current published research > findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may > depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the > same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships > among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this > framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the > studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are > smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of > tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, > definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater > financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are > involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. > Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more > likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many > current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.

This general issue has long been obvious to many researchers, but Ioannidis’ brought a greater statistical clarity to the problem.
