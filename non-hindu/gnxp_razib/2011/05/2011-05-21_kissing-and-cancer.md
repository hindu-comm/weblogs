Kissing and cancer

I recently listened to [Paul Ewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_W._Ewald) talk about how a lot of cancer is due to infection on the radio show *[To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://www.wpr.org/book/100425a.cfm)*. That wasn’t too surprising, Ewald has been making the case for a connection between infection and lots of diseases for a while. What jumped out at me is his claim that **kissing can spread some of the viruses.** Here’s something he told [Discover](http://discovermagazine.com/2009/new-science-of-health/big-idea-beat-cancer-cut-health-care-costs-80-percent) a few years back:

> **D: How do we get infected with these dangerous pathogens?** >

If you think about these modes of transmission, in > which it might be a decade before a person has another partner, you > realize that rapidly replicating is not very valuable—the winning > strategy for the microbe would be to keep a low profile, requiring > persistent infections for years.

They almost all are. A random sample would yield maybe 15 to 20 percent of pathogens associated with cancer being sexually transmitted, yet the figure is almost 100 percent. When you look at viruses alone, it is 100 percent.

If a lot of kissing and number of sexual partners is predictive of risk of cancer, my immediate thought is that this naturally explains **a lot of the cancer that runs in families**. Families can pass on genes and cultural norms which would favor or disfavor certain behaviors.
