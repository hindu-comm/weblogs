Not the real Canada?

Amusing. [Some Fans in Canada See Vancouver as Foreign](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/sports/hockey/vancouver-canucks-may-not-be-canadas-team.html?ref=global-home&pagewanted=print):

> If you are American, you might think that the Vancouver Canucks are now Canada’s team because they are the last Canada-based club standing among the final four in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Well, think again. >
> “Dear rest of Canada — please get your own hockey team” was the > headline to an opinion article last week in The Vancouver Sun, encapsulating the leave-us-alone attitude many Canucks fans are taking in the face of a roiling swelling of both affection and, more often, revulsion for their team across the country. >
> The columnist, Pete McMartin, cited the mounting evidence of recent > days that Canadians had turned on the Canucks for having several top players who are American or Swedish, and playing in Vancouver, traditionally derided as a mild-weather Lotus Land by those from east of British Columbia. >
> He cited the hundreds of “virulently anti-Canuck” messages on a > Calgary Web site posted during the Canucks-Predators series; an > interview in an Edmonton paper with a Finnish hockey writer based in > Vancouver who said: “How Canadian a city is Vancouver to start with? > It never snows. It never freezes”; and various pronouncements from writers and bloggers across Canada disavowing any support for the Canucks in the quest for the first Stanley Cup in their 40 years of existence.
