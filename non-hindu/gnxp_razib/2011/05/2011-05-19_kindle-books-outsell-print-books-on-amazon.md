Kindle books outsell print books on Amazon

[  
Amazon: Kindle books outselling all print books](http://news.cnet.com/amazon-kindle-books-outselling-all-print-books/8301-17938_105-20064302-1.html). This is more something I’d put on [pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:gnxp), but this requires noting more prominently. The figure itself isn’t important, but it is a marker for a silent transition occurring as we shift mediums.
