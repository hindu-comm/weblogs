I.Q. and genomics

In my experience most scientists are not too clear on the details of intelligence testing, perhaps because the whole area is somewhat in ill repute (except when you want to brag about your own SAT/GRE score!). This despite the fact that the profession of science is skewed toward the right end of the intelligence bell curve. [Steve Hsu](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/05/g-and-genomics.html), a physicist at the University of Oregon (and someone I’ve known for a while in the interests of “full disclosure”) has a nice [presentation up in PDF format](http://duende.uoregon.edu/~hsu/talks/ggenomics.pdf) which summarizes the major points of interest in this area. Worth a skim if you are unfamiliar. Additionally he alludes to future directions in the study of the genetic basis of intelligence using genomics. Here’s his abstract:

> I begin with a brief review of psychometric results concerning > intelligence (sometimes referred to as the g factor, or IQ). The main > results concern the stability, validity (predictive power) and > heritability of adult IQ. Next, I discuss ongoing Genome Wide > Association Studies which investigate the genetic basis of > intelligence. Due mainly to the rapidly decreasing cost of sequencing > (currently below \$5k per genome), it is likely that within the next > 5-10 years we will identify genes which account for a significant > fraction of total IQ variation. Finally, I end with an analysis of > possible near term genetic engineering for intelligence. >
> This talk is aimed at physicists and should be accessible even to > those with no specialized background in psychology or biology.

Also, in case you are skeptical, **Steve is quite aware of the difficulties with the enterprise which he outlines in the presentation assuming that the genetic architecture of intelligence is as he assumes.** As sequencing gets cheaper and the sample size of full genomes hits the tens of thousands someone will tackle this, so he and his colleagues figured why not now?
