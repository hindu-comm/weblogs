Friday Fluff – May 13th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [Why the indigenous still dominate the Andean region](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/05/why-the-indigenous-still-dominate-the-andean-region/).

  
2) **Weird search query of the week** (#5 keyword!): “sara sidner ethnicity”

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“Edge question 2011”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/05/edge-question-2011/#comment-69884):

> At business school (at a well-respected, major research university) > one of my profs prided herself on being the most “scientific” of our > professors. That was her reputation and she liked to brag about how > rigorous and “scientific” her classes were. What her approach > consisted of was to demand that any claim made by a student be backed > with a citation in the literature. That was it. You can imagine what > kind of science gets produced in MBA literature and the quality of > studies used to prove or disprove various management fads.  
> (She was also a huge proponent of using Myers-Briggs test to make > hiring and staffing decisions. I consider Myers-Briggs to be one step > up from astrology personally.) >
> Anyway, it was scientism at it’s best. And, given the non-science > backgrounds of a typical MBA class, maybe that’s all that can be hoped > for — to get them to look past just the management fad books at > Borders. I don’t know. Still, it was an odd style. Any analysis > without a citation was dismissed as just personal opinion, while any > citation, regardless of the quality of the paper, carried gravitas. An > in-class discussion was like a debate on scripture — except each side > was quoting scripture from holy books that nobody else in the room had > ever heard of before that moment.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
