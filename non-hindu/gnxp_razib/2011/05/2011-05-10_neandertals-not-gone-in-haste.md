Neandertals not gone in haste?

[John Hawks weighs in](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/late/mezmaiskaya-dating-2011.html) on the [paper I pointed to yesterday](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/05/no-10000-years-of-coexistence/). As someone who couldn’t make heads or tales of the stratigraphy I’m a little relieved that John took time out from his tour of Rome to comment. Not too surprisingly it seems that the relatively definitive seeming conclusion of the study authors, and especially the hyping in the press releases, should probably not be taken at face value.
