Be "cool" while you can

Blaine Bettinger, who released his genotypes into the “public domain,” has a post up, [My Genome Online – A Challenge To You](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2011/05/19/my-genome-online-a-challenge-to-you/):

As Blaine notes there are [dozens of genotypes online which *aren’t anonymous*](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?authkey=CM_q04kO&hl=en&key=t8uMz0RtxLSw2hDZ_DmvPwA&hl=en&authkey=CM_q04kO#gid=0) (obviously you can get plenty of genotype data from the HGDP and what not). I’m pretty sure that there will be thousands online in a few years *at least*. This means that raw numbers will give people a natural sense of anonymity.

But here’s something which might be fun *and* feasible in the near future. Imagine that you meet someone at a party, and are curious about them. You google them on your smartphone and find that their raw genotype is online. Then you go to your [Promethease-app](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Promethease) and run it real quick and find out all sorts of interesting information on them!

Like email this will be novel for all of 6 months. Though I assume it will be much more significant for those who want a serious relationship. Perhaps genotypes could be like photos on personal ads? Optional, but definitely a must if you want to increase views/interest.
