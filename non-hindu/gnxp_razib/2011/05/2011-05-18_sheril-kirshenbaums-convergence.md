Sheril Kirshenbaum's Convergence

Her [new blog](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/convergence/) is [live over at *Wired*](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/convergence/), [Convergence](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/convergence/):

> Convergence is a forum to explore all sorts of topics, but the primary > focus will be the interdisciplinary nature of understanding our world. > For example, if we aspire to protect biodiversity, we must address > social issues. Boosting fisheries requires economics. Tackling our > tremendous energy problem involves a great deal of policy. That’s what this blog is all about: people, science, decision-making, and more. It’s where seemingly unrelated fields overlap, boundaries blur, and practical solutions are sought.
